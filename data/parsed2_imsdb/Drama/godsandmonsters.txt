gods and monsters shooting draft by bill condon screenplay by bill condon based on the novel father of frankenstein by christopher bram may writhing pools of light and dark out
of which emerge images from the bride of frankenstein directed by james whale
elsa lanchester as the monsters bride looks up down left right startled to be alive
the monster stares at her
he asks tenderly desperately
lightning splits the black and white sky revealing a single shattered oak in a desolate landscape
below a human silhouette stumbles through the darkness the top of his head flat his arms long and heavy his boots weighted with mud
suddenly the storm fades
light creeps into the scene and color as we dissolve to melting into a hazy morning sky
in a box canyon off the coast highway we see row after neat row of trailer homes a makeshift village for beach bums
clayton boone opens his eyes
he is handsome in a rough hewn chet baker like way with broad shoulders and a flattop haircut
he grabs a crumpled pack of lucky strikes lights a bent cigarette
clay stands and walks bare assed across the single tin room his head almost touching the ceiling
clay goes a few rounds with a weatherstained speed bag thats set up behind his trailer
clay towels off glances at the morning paper
he moves aside a pile of paperbacks on a card table until he finds a calendar
his finger targets todays first appointment
clay steps out of the trailer clean shaven and dressed in dungarees a t shirt with a fresh pack of cigarettes flipped into one sleeve
he weight lifts a secondhand mower onto the bed of his rusty pick up
clay climbs into the truck slides the key into the ignition
it takes a few tries but the engine finally turns over
clays truck sails down the road hound dog blaring on the radio
main titles end
sprinklers twirl on a grassy slope outside a rambling clapboard house
below a swimming pool forms a perfect rectangle of still water
a title reads santa monica the pick up drives past
clay parks in the back hops out
a shadowy figure stands at a window watching clay unload his red power mower
the shadow is a man with dove white hair wearing a dress shirt and seersucker jacket
this is james whale age
id have more peace of mind if the live in nurse were still here
she was nothing but bother
i not like her mr
jimmy not like her
we do better if you live in again mr
in the dining room visible through open double doors david lewis speaks softly with the housekeeper hanna
she is a squat muffin faced hungarian woman in her late s dressed in black her hair cinched in a tight bun
she speaks with a thick accent
youll contact me if theres an emergency
yes i call you at this number
calls out mr
he moves into the dining room sits opposite david
isnt hanna a peach
hanna ignores him returns to the kitchen
she tells me you havent been sleeping well
its the ridiculous pills they prescribe
if i take them i spend the next day stupid as a stone
if i dont my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once then take the pills
i wanted to be alert for your visit today
especially since i saw so little of you in the hospital
the remark hits its target
im sorry jimmy
but with this movie and two difficult stars the fault dear david is not in ourselves but in our stars
too anxious to laugh you remember how a production eats up ones life
theres no pleasure in making you feel guilty
stands you better go my boy
youll be late for that aeroplane
david extends his hand but whale draws him into a hug
as he starts out david points to a framed painting
by the way i like the renoir
calls out goodbye hanna
hanna runs out of the kitchen to escort david to the door
whale drifts back to the window watches as clay revs up the lawnmower creating a cloud of white smoke
we cut to a bean pole child with flaming red hair whale at age stares up at the coal smoke pouring from a seemingly endless row of chimneys
were in dudley a factory town in the english midlands region known as the black country
stop lagging behind jimmy
well be late for church
whale runs to catch up to his six brothers and sisters
his father william whale frowns at the boys prissy trot
straighten up son
young whales movements thicken into a dim imitation of manly reserve
the whale family marches up a steeply mounting street to dixons green methodist church
whales eyes tighten
he focuses on clay boone as he peels off his t shirt revealing a tattoo on his upper right forearm
whos the new yardman
i hire him while you were in the hospital
he came cheap
whale nods chooses a walking stick
he emerges into the sunlight
whale moves jauntily onto the front lawn singing to himself the bells of hell go ting a ling for you but not for me
oh death where is thy sting a ling
grave where thy victory
whale steps up next to clay
not looking up mornin
my name is whale
this is my house
and your name is
i couldnt help but notice your tattoo
death before dishonor
what does it mean
just that i was in the marines
good for you
you must have served in korea
clay shrugs nonchalantly
getting to be a warm day
a scorcher as you yanks call it
i better get on with my work
whale clears his throat behind the back of his hand
when youre through mr
boone feel free to make use of the pool
were quite informal here
you dont have to worry about a suit
clay glances warily at whale
i got another job to get to this afternoon
whale holds clays look
some other time perhaps
keep up the fine work
whale heads off smiling to himself
pleased to be naughty again
the room is filled with unframed canvasses many of them copies of paintings by the old masters
whale rolls out the easel lifts a half painted canvas into position
he stares at the blotches of color trying to remember what he intended to paint
whale pulls out a heavy volume on rembrandt opens to a black and white plate of the polish rider
we cut to a rough pencil outline of the same painting
whale age sits on his bed ignoring the roughhousing of the three younger brothers who share the room
the door opens and whales mother sarah enters
the privy needs cleaning
i have my class tonight
both have midlands accents like head colds that flatten their speech
whale holds up the sketch to show his mother
dont get above yarself jimmy
leave the drawring to the artists
whale squeezes the pad behind the bed jumps up
quite so mum
to the privy
and he heads cheerfully out of the room
his mother shakes her head
calls out jimmy whale
who are ya to put on airs
but whale is already out the door
we cut to whale studies his face in the mirror
he gives his white hair a few final licks with his silver backed brush
whale comes in from the bedroom
there is iced tea hanna
smiles an interview
after so many years
dont be daft
its just a student from the university
the doorbell rings
whale settles into his club chair and opens a book pretending to read until hanna ushers in the visitor
feigning surprise yes
whale looks up at edmund kay a slim boy who rests his weight on one slouched hip his arms twined behind him
there is a look of mild disappointment on whales face as he realizes that kay is a baby poof
id almost forgotten
my guest for tea
whale stands and holds out his hand
whale this is such an honor
youre one of my favorite all time directors
i cant believe im meeting you
gently teasing no
i expect you cant
and this is your house
the house of frankenstein
looks around i thought youd live in a spooky old mansion or villa
one likes to live simply
peoples movies arent their lives
he suddenly growls out an imitation of boris karloff
kay laughs a high girlish giggle
whale fights a cringe with a polite smile
thats my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours
bride of frankenstein
is it now
i think well take our tea down by the swimming pool
its clear from hannas frown that she doesnt approve of the idea
whale ignores her turns back to kay
will that be good for you mr
opens the back door after you then
whale inspects the boy from behind noticing his wide hips and plumpish posterior
kays hands flap animatedly as whale leads him down to the pool
i love the great horror films
and yours are the best
the old dark house
the invisible man
they look great and have style
whale points to a small shingled house near the pool
this is the studio where i paint
refusing to be sidetracked and your lighting and camera angles
youre got to go back to german silent movies to find anything like it
clay boone gulps some water from the garden hose
he glances down at the pool where kay and whale sit in cast iron chairs
time for you to leave
clay turns to hanna who holds a tray loaded with finger sandwiches and a pitcher of iced tea
im on my way
she doesnt move until clay starts off
kay flips open his steno pad
what do you want to know
start at the beginning
i was born outside london the only son of a minister who was a master at harrow
grandfather was a bishop
church of eng
whales tongue trips on the word his voice suddenly drowned out by the blast of a factory whistle
we cut to fiery melt is poured into molds on the shop floor of a machine parts factory
whale grips the hot casting with tongs
his father william his face blackened with grime hammers away at the flaws
a heavy blow causes young whale to drop the mold prompting catcalls and sneers on the floor
there is a look of genuine fear in whales eyes as he looks up at his singed beast like father
we cut to kay clears his throat softly
whale smiles politely to cover his momentary disorientation
your father was a schoolmaster
i attended eton it wouldnt do for a masters son to attend where his father taught
i was to go up to oxford but the war broke out and i never made it
the great war you know
you had a good war but we had a great one
he glances to see if the boy smiles at the quip
you cant imagine what life was like after the armistice
the twenties in london were one long bank holiday a break from everything dour and respectable
i had a knack with pencil and paper so i was hired to design sets for stage productions
hanna comes down the path with the tray
she places it on the table
thank you hanna
hanna remains planted next to the table
you can go now
she makes an audible sigh and starts back up the hill
there was one play in particular a beautiful grim study of war called journeys end
every experienced director turned it down so i offered myself bullying and begging for the job
journeys end made the careers of everyone associated with it
it was only a matter of time until hollywood beckoned
how much longer before we get to frankenstein
am i correct in assuming mr
kay that its not me youre interested in only my horror pictures
oh no i want to hear everything
you made twenty pictures in all twenty one
the romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking
the horror pictures were trifles
grand guignol for the masses
but its the horror movies youll be remembered for
an abrupt look of anger flashes across whales face
i am not dead yet mr
i never said you were
or will be soon
kay leans over the steno pad determined to be more worthy
journeys end brought you to hollywood whale takes in the boys blank bored expression
i have a proposal mr
this mode of questioning is getting old dont you think
i dont mind
lets make it more interesting
i will answer any question you ask
but for each answer you must remove one article of clothing
kays mouth pops open
thats funny mr
it is isnt it
my life as a game of strip poker
shall we play
then the rumors are true
what rumors might those be
that you were forced to retire because uh a sex scandal
a homosexual scandal you mean
for me to answer a question of that magnitude youll have to remove both your shoes and your socks
kay just sits there squinting and grinning
youre a dirty old man
whale tilts his head as if brushing off a compliment
kay kicks off his penny loafers bends over to remove his socks
you are kind to indulge your elders in their vices
as i indulge the young in theirs
two pale feet emerge
whale leans forward to examine them
he leans back again
there was no scandal
and he reaches into his coat for a cigar
whales hand trembles as he slices a hole at the base then lights the cigar with a wooden match sucking and rotating until the tip is roundly lit
my only other vice
i suppose youd like a fuller answer to your question
it will cost you your sweater
kay hesitates a moment then sets his pen aside to pull the sweater over his head revealing a sleeveless t shirt
too warm for a sweater anyway
you must understand how hollywood was twenty years ago
nobody cared a tinkers cuss who slept with whom so long as you kept it out of the papers
outside of hollywood who knows who george cukor is much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along santa monica
kay stares at him in disbelief
who made a star is born
i never guessed
take off your vest and ill tell you a story
kay plucks at his t shirt glancing toward the house
dont be shy
theres time to stop before you go too far
kay peels off the shirt and tosses it on his shoes and sweater
george is famous for his saturday dinner parties
great artists writers society folk all rubbing elbows with hollywood royalty
but how many of those oh so proper people know about the sunday brunches that follow
gatherings of trade eating leftovers followed by some strenuous fun and frolic in the pool
flicks an ash if a goat like that can continue about his business my more domestic arrangements couldve raised very few eyebrows
the revelation seems to have left kay a little shaken
he flips to a blank page
can we talk about the horror movies now
is there anything in particular you want to know
will you tell me everything you remember about making frankenstein
he glances down at his few remaining articles of clothing
can that count as one question
i cant believe im doing this
kay stands to unbuckle his belt glancing around the yard again
he unzips and steps out of his sharply creased flannel legs
his thighs are thin and pale
just like going swimming isnt it
maybe youd like a swim when were through
i never swim myself so the pool tends to go to waste
tell me everything
let me see
whale swallows a wince trying to block the pain pushing against his skull
universal wanted me for another story and wanted me so baldly i mean badly not baldly
i was given the pick of stories being developed and i picked that one
who came up with the monsters makeup and look
big heavy brow
head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new like tinned beef
hes one of the great images of the twentieth century
as important as the mona lisa
you think so
thats very kind whale clutches at the air suddenly notices that his hand is empty
he looks down and sees the cigar on the flagstones
where did you find him
whale bends down to retrieve his cigar and the change of gravity drives a spike through his skull
how did you cast him
whale turns toward the froggy voice
i must go lie he forces himself up with one hand
kay finally looks up notices whales colorless lips and desperate eyes
are you all right
i just need to lie down
daybed in studio
whale lurches from the table
kay jumps forward catching him under an arm
oh my god
whats wrong mr
is it your heart
he leans against kay who leads him toward the studio
hanna runs down the path clutching the front of her apron in two tight fists
hanna swings open the screen door and grimaces when she sees kay in his bvds
he is kneeling next to whale who is stretched out on the daybed
glasses at the sink
she goes to whale scooping different bottles from the pocket of her apron
i bring them all
she empties a pill into her palm
whale places it into his mouth and takes the glass of water kay passes over hannas shoulder
whale swallows the pill then glances up at kay feigning surprise
youre not dressed
kay frantically crosses his arms over his chest and middle turns to hanna
i was going to take a swim
im sorry i spoiled it for you
you should probably go home
kay hurries outside to retrieve his clothes
hanna undoes whales bow tie
she makes no attempt to be gentle
you must think im terrible hanna
i do not think you anything anymore
just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys
oh shut up
all we did was talk
my attack had nothing to do with him
perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold
let me lie here
hanna nods moves to the door
whale closes his eyes breathes deeply trying to block the throbbing sound in his brain
we cut to the noise is deafening the clank of chains the screech of wheels and the endless banging of hammers
william whale continues to knock away at the hot casting
the rhythmic sound blends into the insistent knocking of which smashes against sheet metal
clay boones eyes dart open
you told me to get you up asshole
a baseball capped head is visible through the louvered glass in the trailers door
dwight joad clays neighbor squints to see inside
hasta la vista boone
and give the jail bait a squeeze for me
clay glances over seems surprised to see a naked back facing him on the bare mattress
rose the girl stirs turns to face him
she is at most
my name is daisy
time to go daisy
she presses her naked body against clays
i could help you fix up this place real nice
clay takes a deep breath trying to clear the gumminess from his brain
dont you have to be somewhere
like high school maybe
i gave it up for lent
daisy smiles at her own joke
jumps up from the bed time to hit the road kid
whale ponders the half painted canvas clearly distressed by his lack of progress
the stillness is punctured by the sound of clays lawnmower being dragged up the brick steps
whale smiles puts down his brush
clay stops turns around feeling someones eyes watching him
singing the bells of hell go ting a ling
the mower slips out of clays hands momentarily
he looks around spots whale inside the studio
everything alright mr
just got away from me
sorry to disturb you
the screen door squeaks open clatters shut
a leather slipper and rubber tipped cane appear
whale strolls into view smiling
i was just about to ask hanna to bring down iced tea
id like it very much if youd join me
i stink to high heaven right now
the honest sweat of ones brow
i assure you i wont be offended
let me tell hanna to bring tea for two
whales cane trembles in his skeletal hand
his frailty chips away at clays resolve
or would you prefer a beer
iced teas fine
clay hoses the crumbs of grass off his arms
he dries his hands and arms with his hat then wads it up and stuffs it into his shirt to wipe out his armpits
clay stands at the screen door
come in mr
whale sits on a daybed next to a pile of newspapers
he gestures at a wooden armchair across from him
my workshop my studio
hardly somewhere in which a sweaty workman should feel out of place
clay glances at the unframed canvases on the wall and stacked in the corners
these are your paintings
excuse me but are you famous
you know what they say
if you have to ask im just a hick who cuts lawns
but some of these look familiar
they were familiar when i painted them
that ones copied from a dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago
and thats a rembrandt
theyre just copies then
but before i retired you might say i had a brief time in the sun
fame as it were
tell me do you like motion pictures
sure everybody does
when i was a kid id go with my sister twice a week
were you an actor or something
in my youth yes but never in hollywood
no i was merely a director here
what were some of your movies
this and that
the only ones you maybe have heard of are the frankenstein pictures
clay sits up surprised skeptical and impressed all at once
frankenstein and bride of and son of and all the rest
i made only the first two
the others were done by hacks
you must be rich
making a couple of famous movies like those
heres hanna with our refreshments
can you get the door
clay jumps up to open the screen door
hanna walks past refusing to look at him
she sets the tray on a table very hard ringing the glasses and silverware
how are you feeling mr
how is your mind today
my minds lovely
hanna flares her nostrils at him
you remember what the doctor tells us
yes yes yes
i merely invited mr
boone in for a glass of tea
well have a brief chat and hell finish the yard
i am not forgetting your last brief chat
we can manage without you
hanna stares up at clay
he looks plenty big
you wont need my help if anything goes flooey
she shakes her head and marches out the door
clay returns to his chair and sits down again
when they stay in your employ too long servants begin to think theyre married to you
smiles at clay please mr
what did she mean by going flooey
i returned recently from a stay in hospital
what was wrong
a touch of stroke
clay nods chugs his tea
when he lowers the glass he finds the old man watching him
you must excuse me for staring mr
but you have a marvelous head
to an artistic eye you understand
have you ever modeled
you mean like posed for pictures
sat for an artist
with a laugh whats to sketch
you have the most architectural skull
and your nose
broke is more like it
but expressively broken
how did it happen
football in college
you went to university
just a year
i dropped out to join the marines
you were a marine
whales gaze deepens
he laughs lightly
i apologize for going on like this
its the sunday painter in me
of course i can understand your refusal
its a great deal to ask of someone
you mean you really want to draw me
id pay for the privilege of drawing your head
even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him
and its just my head you want
what are you suggesting
youll charge extra if i include a hand or a bit of shoulder
you dont want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit right
i have no interest in your body mr
i can assure you of that
clay takes a moment to size up whale whose innocent slightly befuddled smile makes him appear about as threatening as a box of cornflakes
all right then
i could use the extra dough
well have a most interesting time
whale lifts his glass takes a small sip of tea
clay fetches a pair of hedge clippers from his truck
he cant help stopping by the side view mirror to look at his face
doctors and technicians flash lights into whales eyes
test his reflexes
inject him with radioactive isotope
whale sits very still with his head behind a fluoroscope screen while two doctors murmur over the image
a pair of x rays are slapped wet on a light board
two skulls one facing forward the other in profile
payne a bland young neurologist points to a smudge in the side view x ray
this is the area of infarction
by which we mean the portion of brain affected by the stroke
the venetian blinds of the examining room are closed
whale sits calmly flanneled legs crossed at the knees gazing at his own skull
youre a lucky man mr
whatever damage was done by your stroke it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired
yes yes dr
but from the neck up
whats my story there
thats what im trying to explain
payne turns off the light board and goes to the venetian blinds
the room is instantly full of sun
the central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations
whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short circuited this mechanism
parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random
youre saying theres an electrical storm in my head
thats as good a way as any to describe it
ive seen far worse cases
you might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane
but the rest of it
the killing headaches
the phantom smells
my inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once
its all nothing more than bad electricity
in a manner of speaking
ive never encountered the olfactory hallucinations but im sure theyre related
so what do i do
take the luminal to sleep or whenever you feel an attack coming on
you seem to be saying that this isnt just a case of resting until im better
that my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life
the doctor responds with a sympathetic gaze
whale nods solemnly
whale makes his way toward the stairs
he passes a stoop shouldered elderly woman who leans on the arm of her middle aged daughter
then an old man in a wheelchair his eyes brimming with bewilderment and despair
hanna opens the door
clay wears dungarees and a white dress shirt
dont worry you already paid me
im here because the master is waiting for you
she gestures him in shuts the door
clay follows hanna into the kitchen
hes down in his studio
take this with you
she thrusts a tv tray toward him
two glasses two bottles of beer a bottle of coke
its your job lady not mine
hands back the tray im here so he can draw my picture
im keeping away
what you are doing is no business of mine
whatre you talking about
what kind of man are you
are you a good man
yeah im a good man
something make you think im not
you will not hurt him
gimme a break
im going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures
is that going to hurt him
closes her eyes i am sorry
forget everything i say
i will take the tray
you do that
clay opens the squeaking door and enters behind hanna
whale stands at a drafting table sharpening a pencil
hanna sets the tray down
very good hanna
she goes toward the door wrinkling her forehead at clay
the screen door bangs shut
im sure youd like something to wet your whistle while i work
whale opens a bottle of beer pours it into a glass hands it to clay
he gestures to a chair
well go slowly today
since this is your first time as a model
he pulls a tv guide out of his back pocket
did you see this
theyre showing one of your movies tomorrow night
you dont say
bride of frankenstein
i much prefer show boat or the invisible man
shall we begin
clay takes a swig of beer and sets the glass on the floor
ready when you are
whale stares at clay
that shirt mr
its too white too distracting
would it be asking too much for you to take it off
im not wearing an undershirt
pish posh mr
im not your aunt tilly
but its just my face you want to draw
oh if its going to make you uncomfortable
sighs perhaps we can find something else for you to wear
he lifts a drop cloth off a footlocker revealing a stack of physique magazines
whale casually covers them with a newspaper
we could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders
would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness
all right already
ill take it off
kind of warm in here anyway
he unbuttons the shirt and pulls it off
steps forward here
clay adjusts his belt buckle as whale hangs the shirt on a wall peg
he moves back to the easel again
i think well have you sit slightly sideways so you can rest one arm on the back of the chair
the arm with the tattoo faces the easel
take a picture it lasts longer
thats exactly what i intend to do
a clatter of pencils in the easels tray followed by a moment of silence
finally a low whistly scratch
clay concentrates on keeping still focusing on an open window
you seem to have no idea how handsome you are mr
it has to do with how snugly your face fits your skull
clay wipes a thin line of sweat from his waist
would you be more comfortable barefoot
feel free to remove your boots and socks
its a bit like being at the doctor isnt it
you have to remain perfectly still while i examine and scrutinize you
whale suddenly sniffs as if smelling something
he sniffs several times more but continues to draw
to himself dripping
to clay do you ever eat dripping in this country
the fat from roasts and such congealed in jars
used like butter on bread
sounds like something you feed the dog
only the poorest families ever ate it
we kept ours in a crockery jar
your family ate dripping
catching himself of course not
as i said only poor people whale stops
he lets out a bitter laugh
ive just realized how terribly ironic it all is
ive spent most of my life outrunning my past
now its flooding all over me
clay stares out blankly
theres something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth
yes my family ate dripping
beef dripping and four to a bed and a privy out back in the alley
are you also from the slums mr
we werent rich
but we werent poor either
no you were middle class like all americans
i guess youd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks
in dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any american can imagine
every englishman knows his place
and if you forget theres always someone to remind you
my family had no doubts about who they were
but i was an aberration in that household a freak of nature
i had imagination cleverness joy
where did i get that
certainly not from them
whales voice has changed becoming more pinched and nasal
they took me out of school when i was fourteen and put me in a factory
they meant no harm
they were like a family of farmers whove been given a giraffe and dont know what to do with the creature except harness him to the plow
whale seems completely lost in the past by now
hatred was the only thing that kept my soul alive in that soul killing place
and among those men i hated was my own poor dumb father
who put me in that hell to begin with
whale peers out from behind the square of paper
he pales when he sees his father william his face covered with grime glaring at him from across the room
whale retreats behind the pad takes a breath
relief floods whales face
he looks out smiles at clay
you have to excuse me mr
since my stroke i am often overcome with nostalgia
i dont mind
im not crazy about my old man either
whale rubs a hand across his eyes and steps into the open
why dont we break for five minutes
you probably want to stretch your legs
whale pulls the cover sheet over the pad to hide what hes drawn so far
so you just sat there while this old limey banged his gums
the place is dead
theres only clay and dwight sitting at the bar with the owner harry a balding hep cat with a scraggly tuft of beard
and in a booth kid saylor a cocky year old necking with a pony tailed teenager
i liked it
you learn stuff listening to old timers
to harry you ever hear of this whale fellow
cant say that i have
cant say ive heard of a lot of people though
if you dont believe me lets watch this movie
see if his names on it
how about it harry
can i watch my damn movie
i told you
i dont turn on the tv except for the fights
betty cartwright appears behind the bar lugging a bucket of ice from the storeroom
shes an attractive woman in her early s big boned and almost as tall as clay
a spooky movie
just what this place needs tonight
couldnt make it any deader doll
set me up
your friend want one
clay reacts to the silent treatment with a tight smile
yeah one for whats his name here
she sets down two bottles of pabst without looking at clay
to harry i say let loverboy watch his movie
and be grateful boones not cutting shirley temples lawn
why is everybody giving me crap tonight
you come in here proud as a peacock because some old coot wants to paint your picture
were just bringing you back to earth
sounds screwy to me
i cant imagine a real artist wanting to spend time looking at that kisser
this kisser wasnt so bad you couldnt lay under it a few times
betty glares at clay who realizes hes gone too far
i bet this is just some fruit pretending to be famous
so he can get in the big guys pants
what makes you say that
just thinking out loud
yeah well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself
all right then
hes interested in you for your conversation
we know what a great talker you are
not anymore you dont
explodes were watching the movie harry
you got that
we are watching my fucking movie
calm down clay
just calm down
well watch it
harry reaches up turns on a battered motorola
on the tv a voice announces tonight boris karloff in the bride of frankenstein
the titles come on
ending with the phrase directed by which floats over a white blob
the blob jumps forward to form letters james whale
what did i tell you
the movie starts
the monster being roasted alive in the flaming wreckage of a mill
this looks corny
go wash glasses if you dont like it
in a flooded crater under the mill the monster kills an old man
he climbs up flips the mans wife into the pit below
an owl blinks impassively
two down and its just started
minnie a hatchet faced woman with fluttering ribbons is now alone with the monster
whale and hanna are in bathrobes and slippers and there is a glass of milk and a plate of cookies on whales tv tray
on the tv minnie played by una oconnor squeaks and whimpers and screams
wonderful old una
gobbling like an old turkey hen
but hanna isnt amused
she unclenches her arms to close the bathrobe over her throat
oh that monster
how could you be working with him
dont be silly hanna
hes a very proper actor
and the dullest fellow imaginable
minnie flees in a bowlegged jig up the hill
whale smiles again
on the tv dr
pretorius played by ernest thesiger delivers a toast with inimitably ripe enunciation to a new world of gods and monsters
dwight and harry and betty all laugh
these old movies are such a hoot
they thought they were being scary but theyre just funny
defensively maybe its supposed to be funny
funny is funny and scary is scary
you dont mix them
suddenly the tinny tv soundtrack is drowned out by the voice of elvis presley
kid saylor bends over the jukebox wagging his denim butt and tapping a high top sneaker
some of us are watching a movie
clay jumps from his stool
saylor sees him coming steps aside
you want me to turn it down
clay slams the heel of his hand against saylors chest
the boy staggers backward
clay grabs the corner of the jukebox and jerks it from the wall the needle scratches across the song
saylor holds up both hands in a nervous surrender
hey i didnt know
its your favorite movie
clay returns to the bar and uprights the stool
saylor escorts his girl to the door
youre like a dog with a bone over this movie clay
i just want to watch it okay
on the tv the blind man thanks god for sending him a friend
hannas frown pops open
he is not going to kill the old man
my heart isnt that black
in a crypt the monster meets dr
pretorius who is having a midnight snack on top of a closed coffin
the monster asks
yes i hope so answers pretorius without batting an eyelash
he offers the monster a drink then adds have a cigar
theyre my only weakness
the cigars were my own brand
so that i could have the leftovers
on the tv the monster groans love dead
whales focus sharpens prompted by the unexpected discussion of death
the monster holds a skull in both hands and happily growls wiiife
betty shudders for real this time
i wonder if they knew how sick they were
the monsters lonely and he wants a friend a girlfriend somebody
what sick about that
frankenstein and pretorius make their final preparations
frankenstein inquires where the fresh heart came from
there are always accidental deaths occurring pretorius replies
once again whale responds to the talk of death
finally the bride comes to life
she looks up down left right uncertain who she is
the monster stares tenderly
he timidly touches her arm and she screams
you dont want him the monster is heartbroken
nobody loves him not even his bride
the bride shrieks again
she is horrible
she is beautiful
the monsters pain turns to anger
he tears through the lab orders frankenstein to escape with his wife
but he wants pretorius and the bride to stay
we belong dead
whale reacts sharply to the line
the monster blows up the laboratory and the movie ends
hanna shivers as she stands
i am sorry mr
jimmy but your movie is not my teacup
still i am glad there is a happy ending
the bad people are dead and the good people live
she hits the button on the magnavox with the flat of her palm
betty turns off the motorola
weird weird weird
harry stands up and stretches
clay remains seated
so what did you think
i loved it
i want a switch like that in my trailer so i can blow us to kingdom come when things dont go my way
he wobbles when he climbs off his stool
damn but its getting drunk in here
the bride of dwight is going to bite my head off
he tilts toward the door
you coming boone
i think ill hang around
go home clay
were closing up
i thought id give you a hand since i kept you open
he waits to see how betty reacts
harry takes his book and cash drawer to the back door
im next door if you need me
he gives clay one last look and goes out to the breezeway and his apartment
you know what
i think you guys are all jealous
laughs whats to be jealous of
ive gotten to know someone whos famous
not so famous any of us have ever heard of him
if he were that famous he probably wouldnt give me the time of day
this way hes like my famous person
laughs at himself yeah my own personal famous person
who treats me like im somebody worth talking to
clay leans down to plug in the jukebox
you want to go for a swim
she snaps her mouth open and imitates the brides furious cat hiss
whats that mean
it means its too cold to go swimming
and i dont mean the water
i wasnt going to try anything
yeah and im never going to smoke another cigarette
he patiently waits by the door while betty turns out the lights
she walks briskly through the glow of the jukebox waving clay outside with her hand
betty pulls the door shut and bends over to lock it
clay catches a glimpse of skin in the side slit of her shirttail
lets go for a walk at least
walk and talk
i really feel like talking tonight
bettys eyes blink in mock surprise
this old guy hes the kind of person i expected to meet when i moved out here
someone whos done things with his life
do you realize youre more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me
hes a man
and by the way you have no business calling him a homo
it never crossed your mind
hes an artist
anyway hes too old to think about sex
all the old men i know think about nothing but sex
she opens the door of her chevy
clay grabs it with both hands to keep her from getting in
whats eating you tonight
betty hesitates then looks him sharply in the eye
you picked up that girl right in front of me
hey no strings right
thats what you always said
just good pals who have the hots for each other
it still hurt
i didnt mean to
no im actually kind of glad it happened
it made me wonder what the hell i was doing with my life
letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you
you liked it too
i loved it
if you enjoy it you should do it
you know i just cant do that anymore
i still have time to get things right
get married again you mean us
betty bursts out laughing
the look on your face
youre not marriage material
youre not even boyfriend material
youre a kid
a big fun slightly irresponsible kid
im not a kid
what are you then
what will you be ten years from now
still cutting lawns
still banging horny divorcees in your trailer
clay glares at her his jaw working forward in anger
i like my life
im a free man
sure youre free for now at least
but how long before youre just alone
pathetic and alone
clays anger jumps from his jaw into his shoulders and arms
he grabs the door handle
so you dont want to fuck
thats what youre telling me
is that all this conversation means to you
am i going to put out or not
im sick of playing games
betty quickly gets into the car
before she can pull the door shut clay slams it on her hard
her hands leap in front of her face as if hed hit her
the look of fear in her eyes startles clay out of his rage
this is coming out all wrong she frantically turns the key in the ignition and the chevy pulls out
from here on out boone youre just another tired old face on the other side of the bar
the car screeches away
clay stumbles across the highway
clay comes to the dump at the end of the canyon
he climbs into it kicking at loose cans
its all shit
shit on by women
shit on by the marines
shit on by the world
he shouts the word at the cliff for the raw sudden violence of shouting
a dog in the carport starts to bark
the sound of clays pain echoes off the canyon as we cut to whale is sitting up n bed when hanna knocks
she enters with a tray loaded with bottles and vials
you will take them all mr
ill be fine hanna
whale takes the pills one by one until he comes to the bottle of luminal
he opens the pheno bottle to shake out a capsule and a dozen spill into his palm
he stares at them
hanna opens the door gasps when she sees whale lying motionless on the bed
she spots the empty bottle of luminal
oh no mr
hanna kneels next to the body
she makes a sign on the cross launches into a frantic hail mary
we cut to whale snorts at the imagined scene
one by one he returns the capsules to their bottle until a single pill remains
he places it on the table then turns out the lamp and lies on his back in the dark waiting for sleep
the distant sound of laughter invades the darkness
whale sits up straining to identify the voices
the bedroom wall opposite him melts away revealing elsa lanchester and boris karloff sit side by side in dentist chairs cloths around their necks heads tilted back
jack pierce the makeup artist is patting the hair drawn over a cage on elsas head
he looks up sees whale and breaks into a conspiratorial grin
elsas eyes are closed she hasnt heard whale enter
you done yet love
i am absolutely dying for a fag
whale tiptoes in for a better look
karloff has a mouthpiece to help him breathe while the assistant adds another coat of green sizing to the still incomplete makeup
gurgles goo orning ames
and a very good morning to you
elsas eyes snap open
there are no mirrors on the walls
the way you look at me james
what have you done this time
bring a mirror
let the bride feast upon her visage
do i look a fright
karloff shrugs irked that shes getting all the attention
jack pierce lifts a large mirror
nasal new yorkese behold the bride of frankenstein
elsa stares at the beautiful corpse in the mirror
she snaps her head left right up down startled by the sight of herself electrocuted into frightened spastic jerks
as whale observes his star we see her spasms through his eyes as a series of dissonant line jumping close ups
and you said thered be some of me left
nobodys going to know me in this getup
nonsense my dear
you look extraordinary
to an assistant todays script
and a pencil
whale scans the page of shooting script the margin marked in pencil cu ms mls
whale pencils in a bracket and scribbles cu a b c d mos
jack i want to get on this right away
sorry boris we wont get to you until this afternoon
i ish you old e ooner
the assistant removes his mouthpiece
i could have spent the morning tending to my roses
the interior of stage c is completely filled by the laboratory set
electricians adjust the lights on the wooden tower beside the brides table
colin clive dr
frankenstein and ernest thesiger dr
pretorius sit off to the side in full makeup and costume
clive mumbles earnestly over his script
thesiger pinches his face over the needle he dips in and out of an embroidery ring
whale comes on the set with elsa on his arm
she walks regally beside him the train of her long white robe thrown over one arm
theres a wolf whistle from overhead and applause causing elsa to curtsy to her admirers
thesiger takes her hand leans back to study her
is the audience to presume that colin and i have done her hair
i thought we were mad scientists not hairdressers
only a mad scientist could do this to a woman
oh no my dear
you look absolutely amazing
theres no way i can compete with you
the scene is yours
in the sequel james two lady scientists should make a monster
and our monster would be gary cooper
i wouldve thought mr
leslie howard would be more your line
more your line
my line nowadays runs to rin tin tin
dogs are so much more dependable than men
softly to thesiger how is he today
stiff as a board
calls out yes colin
come see what theyve done to our elsa
clive walks over glumly
im not at my best today jimmy
a touch of flu you know
whale sees through the excuse rests an arm on clives shoulder
relax my boy
you could do this scene in your sleep
clive grits his teeth and nods
whale positions them in front of the upended table clive and thesiger holding elsas robe out by the hems
the shadow of the sound boom passes back and forth while they rehearse
i gather we not only did her hair but dressed her
what a couple of queens we are colin
clive looks distraught which brings some life to his stiffness
whale sees this decides to tune it higher
yes a couple of flaming queens
and pretorius is a little in love with dr
frankenstein you know
clives distress reads clearly now
he is twitchy and alive
i think its coming together
shall we have a go
he sits in the canvas directors chair nods to the assistant director
quiet on the set
the warning bell rings
the lights sizzle and blaze
okay for sound
a young man with a clapboard steps in front of the camera
scene two fifteen
the bride snaps her head in various directions
thesiger slopes back fingers splayed intoxicated by his creation the bride of frankenstein
whale sits with his legs crossed jogging his raised foot as if conducting the scene with his show
fully engaged intensely alive
we cut to whale glances at the clock sees that it is
he is wide awake
he reaches over picks up the luminal
whale reluctantly places the pill on his tongue and swallows
he rests his head on the pillow and stares at the ceiling where the reflection of the window sheers casts an ever shifting pattern of light and dark
we move down to reveal its a cobblestone cell a plaster set from bride of frankenstein
whale sits in a massive chair straining against thick iron chains as a lightning storm rages outside
in the distance heavy footsteps coming closer until the cell door is filled with the silhouette of the monster
whale hardly dares to breathe as the monster rips off the door and enters the cell
the monster steps into the light allowing us to see his face for the first time
it is clay boone dressed in a marine parade uniform
he uses his hedge clippers to cut the chains from around whales chest
thank you so much
clay leans down and takes whale in his arms cradling him like a child
they move across the sound stage clay carefully sidestepping the lights and cables on the floor until they reach the next set clay carries whale past a painted backdrop of
a stormy english countryside
whale lies on the brides table
clay pulls on a doctors smock picks up a scalpel from a table covered with various medical instruments
he carves a thin circle around the top of whales forehead
then with one deft movement he pops off whales scalp and pulls out the brain
it is soot covered charred used up
whale watches with detached fascination as clay tosses it on the floor then takes a throbbing luminous mass from a tray
clay inserts the new brain into whales skull sutures the scalp back into place
he fastens the conducting clamps around whales temples then throws the heavy circuit breaker
lights throb with bursts of energy
loose sparks crackle
rotary sparks create snapping circles of fire
as the energy of the raging storm is harnessed into the machinery
clay steps back to take in his handiwork
a sudden look of panic fills whales face
it isnt working
the experiment is a failure
clay glances down at whale whose breathing is slowing
realizing that the new brain hasnt taken just go to sleep
a serenity suffuses whales features as he stares up at the pale flicker of lightning
his breathing finally stops his face a tranquil mask of death
we cut to whale wakes with a start
he checks the clock sees that its past nine
he presses an intercom button on the bedside table
im up hanna
whale sits up drinks in the sunlight
he notices some grass clippings and leaves scattered on the bedspread
what in gods name whale turns and sees clay lying next to him
angrily i told you to sleep
clays hands close around whales neck
we cut to whale opens his eyes groggily
he scans the room in panic clearly unable to get his bearings
whale tries to stand but his legs give way beneath him
whale and hanna stare straight out as she reaches down and unbuttons the tiny buttons on his pajama fly
whale supports himself with one hand on hannas shoulder as he relieves himself with the other
whale sits up in bed staring dumbly at the morning paper
hanna reaches in to take away the breakfast tray
does the yardman come today
a thin smile forms on whales face
clay prunes the roses on the front lawn
hanna appears frowning
something i can do for you
the master wants to know if you are free for lunch
i tell him you will be having other plans but he insists i ask
got a lawn this afternoon but im free until then
expect nothing fancy
hanna goes inside
clay rolls the mower down the path
clay knocks on the bottom of the dutch door as he lifts the latch and walks in
he is wearing a fresh madras shirt
the master is dressing
i am to offer you a drink
there is whiskey and there is iced tea
tea is fine
he sits at the kitchen table
you are a guest now
you go in the living room
thats okay hanna
im more comfortable in here
it is hanna isnt it
she eyes him suspiciously shrugs pours a glass of tea
clay notices a bible on the counter
how long you worked for mr
i bet youve seen a lot of famous people come and go
we live simply mr
jimmy and i
people come to play bridge
and now and then young men to swim
you have people boone
you mean family
all in joplin missouri
im not married
oh i dont know
because no girl in her right mind will have me
a man who is not married has nothing
he is a man of trouble
you need a woman
you proposing what i think youre proposing
dont you think im a little young for you
hanna twists her head around with such an indignant look that clay bursts out laughing
she realizes that she is being teased
always pulling legs
everything is comedy
mimics an english accent how very amusing
how marvelously droll
hanna stares at clay until his smile fades
she resumes her chopping in silence
you ever been married hanna
i am married still
whats your husband do
he is dead now twenty years
then youre as single as i am
i have children grandchildren too
i visit when i can
but now that mr
jimmy cannot be left very long i do not get away much
sighs poor mr
there is much good in him but he will suffer the fires of hell
youre sure of that
this is what the priests tell me
his sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven
sins of the flesh
everybody has those
his is the worse
worse the unspeakable
the deed no man can name without shame
she loses patience with clays blank look
what is the good english
all i know is bugger
he is a bugger
men who bugger each other
clay slowly sits up
that is why he must go to hell
i do not think it fair
but gods law is not for us to judge
youre telling me mr
whale is a homo
you did not know
no not really you and he are not doing things
that is what i hope
i did not think you a bugger too
i fear only that you might hurt him if he tries
im not going to hurt anyone
i trust you
off in the distance a throat loudly trumpets itself clear
you must go in
he will not like to think i have had you in the kitchen
clay gets up slowly reluctant to leave the room
whale comes forward as clay enters offering a hand at the end of a spindly wrist
how are you mr
so glad you are free for lunch
all right i guess
i assume you worked up an appetite with your labor
a hesitant smile from clay
whale picks a stack of mail off the table rifles through envelopes
forgive my rudeness
at my age the post is the cream of the day
he returns the stack to the table but holds on to a square envelope
do you mind
clay looks off while whale opens the envelope
he is examining a folded card
he rubs a thumb over the printed lettering
her majestys loyal subjects in the motion picture industry
reception at the home of
his lips smack open in disgust
that pushy little horning in on the queens sister then offering to share her with the whole damn raj
i live in this country to get away from this rubbish
he tosses the invitation on the table
is this davids doing
this davids a friend
an old useless friend
you must excuse me mr
this is a world i finished with long ago
i pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment
a deep breath lunch should be ready
he holds out an open hand so that clay can precede him into the dining room
hanna sets down two steaming plates of omelettes
whale hands a glass of red wine to clay
they both take a sip of wine
smells lovely hanna
hanna nods steals a glance at clay as she leaves
saw your movie the other night
watched it with some friends
did you now
i liked it
we all did
did anyone laugh
people are so earnest nowadays
was it supposed to be funny
i had to make it interesting for myself you see
a comedy about death
the trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isnt in on the joke
a sip of wine but the monster never receives any of my gibes
he is noble
noble and misunderstood
whale gazes pointedly at clay who eats with his elbows on the table quickly bolting the hot omelette
in korea mr
clay looks up
did you kill anyone
i dont like to talk about that
its nothing to be ashamed of in the service of ones country
thats something to be proud of
any jerk with a gun can kill someone
hand to hand combat is the true test
did you ever slay anyone hand to hand
i could have though
yes i believe you could
a sip of wine how free is your schedule this afternoon
i got the hedges to do here then another lawn out by la cienega
what is we say phooey to the hedges
could you spare an hour after lunch
to sit for me
ill pay our going rate
plus what youd get if you did the hedges
i dont feel like sitting still today
whale tilts a scrutinizing eye at clay
hanna carries the dirty dishes back to the kitchen
clay starts to bite the tip off a cigar
whale passes him a gold penknife
just a trim
and mine while youre at it
fingers are a bit stiff today
you ever been married mr
at least not in the legal sense
clay hands a clipped cigar back to whale
so you had a wife
or a husband
depending on which of us you asked
my friend david
he lived here for many years
the other cigar crunches faintly between clays fingers
does that surprise you
no i youre a homosexual
if one must have a clinical name
im not you know
i never thought you were
you dont think of me that way do you
what way might that be
look at me like like i look at women
dont be ridiculous
i know a real man like you would break my neck if i so much as laid a hand on him
besides youre not my type
clay suddenly laughs
whales smile deepens
so we understand each other
what you do is no business of mine
live and let live i say
i hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today
i whale continues to smile slyly
what are you afraid of mr
certainly not a frail old man like me
clay has no answer
he gives in with a sigh
clay sits sideways on the chair again
whale stands at the easel
can i see what you did so far
it will only make you self conscious
youll have to remove your shirt
but we have to match the other sketch
i just feel more comfortable keeping it on
you just said you didnt want me self conscious
whale steps forward
perhaps if we open the shirt and pull whales hands to in
clays flesh tightens he shrinks back
the hands stop palms raised
i have made you nervous
id just rather keep it on
suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders
is that so much to ask
just two little buttons
whales thumb and fingers unpluck buttons in midair
what you told me at lunch is still very weird for me
so either you sketch me like i am or ill say forget it and go do your hedges
whale takes a step back
his eyes are locked on clay fascinated by his temper
i dont mean to be a prick but thats how i feel
i dont want to scare you off
not before im finished with you
whale glides behind the easel
the pencils rattle in the tray
tell me more about yourself mr
you have a steady companion
not at the moment
you know how it is
you have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it
very well put
the world is just one kiss ass game after another
a man has to make up his own life alone
thoreau with a lawnmower
smiles i like that
but take care mr
freedom is a drug much like any other
too much can be a very bad thing
clay glances out the window
feigning a merely casual interest is that why you and your friend split up
because you wanted to be free
in a way yes
i suppose so
i know its why i stopped making pictures
whale backs away from the easel and stares at the paper with a sour frown
you might not think it to look at me now but there was a time when i was at the very pinnacle of my profession
the horror movies were behind me
id done show boat
great box office
now i was to do something important
the road back
an indictment of the great war and what it did to germany
it was to be my masterpiece
the fucking studio butchered it
it was hitlers armies were already massing and still the new york bankers stood in line to curry his favor
anything to avoid losing the german market
they cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick
the picture laid an egg a great expensive bomb
for which i was blamed
a shadow passes over whales eyes
he presses two fingers against his temple
after that i went out of fashion
i was no longer able to command the best projects so i walked away
why should i spend my time working in such a dreadful business
do you miss it
dismissive its so far in the past now
over fifteen years whale stops himself
he smiles gently at clay
making movies was the most wonderful thing in the world
working with friends
yes i suppose i miss it
more so now that whale reaches into his pocket takes out the bottle of luminal
i think we all want to feel weve left our mark on the world
i wish i had done more work
youve done a helluva lot more than most people
whale moves across the room to the screen door
but i chose freedom
david was still in the thick of it his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue
i didnt fancy spending my golden years as merely the friend
the dirty little secret of a nervous producer
how long were you
we were like a play whose run outlasted the casts ability to keep it fresh
so i finally decided to close down the show
whale places a pill on his tongue and swallows
he fixes clay with a pinched smile
when all fetters are loosened a certain hedonism creeps in dont you think
there was a period when this house was overrun with young men
some even posed for me
right where youre sitting now
clay sits uncomfortably in his chair
his face flushes
of course they werent nearly as bashful
no this room was once filled with bare buttocks
hard arrogant pricks cut it out
clay explodes out of his chair knocking over a small side table
i cant do this anymore
he looms over whale whose breathing starts to quicken
isnt it enough you told me youre a fairy
do you have to rub my nose in it
i assure you mr
boone i meant no from now on mr
whale i cut your grass and thats it
before whale can respond clay storms out nearly ripping the screen door off its hinges
whale sits on the daybed takes a few quick breaths
suddenly the air is filled with the sounds of people cavorting in the pool
whale looks up sees a young man standing outside the screen door
it is now dark outside
come on jimmy
watch me dive
whale offers a melancholy smile
i think ill just rest for a moment
the man shrugs disappears into the shadows
we move across the room and through the door
whale sits in a directors chair a martini in one hand a cigar in the other a harmless old uncle watching young men swagger and splash in the pool
i think were ready to go
he glances over sees clay in plaid bathing trunks sitting apart from the others
he is puffing on a camel
youre up mr
clay ignores him
whale puts down his martini and cigar picks up a polaroid camera
he moves over to clay
the extras are in their places
now we need the star
wouldnt you like to get in the pool
i never swim
whale removes clays cigarette crushes it with his shoe
behind him the pool is now a pit full of naked shadows
youll have to remove that shirt
whale touches clays bare chest
clay grabs hold of his wrist causing the old man to yelp in pain
in the pool the extras shriek in alarm
clays hands close tightly around whales throat
whales hands fly to his throat
he opens his eyes and gasps greedily for air the young mens screams lingering in the room
there is a look of genuine terror on his face
the sun goes down
clay wearily pushes his lawnmower struggling to concentrate on the darkened lawn
the smug property owner peers out at clay from behind a screen door
do you mind turning on a light
its getting pretty soupy out here
should have been here when you said you would
you whack off a tow dont think about taking me to court
youre lucky i even squeezed you in today
dont take that tone with me bub
theres japs in this town that work cheaper and do flowers too
clay takes a deep breath
he cant afford to get angry
will you just turn on the porch light
the owner flicks on the light
clay presses through the saturday night crowd
clay cranes his neck to scan the crowd
she took the night off
some guy shes had her eye on for a while
harry smiles pointedly at clay hands him the beer
thanks a lot pal
clay turns his back on the bar
he sees dwight moving through the crowd
dwight nods a little coolly
have a drink
dwights wife a pert steely eyed brunette places a firm hand on his shoulder
dwight shrugs heads toward the door
a pretty too tan blonde woman in her early s is standing at the end of the bar eyeing clay
he lifts his glass and she responds with an open smile
clay and the woman go at it their shadows visible through the glass louvers
clay tugs on a cord and the harsh overhead fluorescent buzzes to life
he splashes his face with water then catches his reflection in the mirror
clay parks outside the local branch of the public library
clay leafs through an oversized folio bound copies of the new york times he glances at an article from
interview with a passing whale
there is a picture of whale captioned famous british director
a librarian approaches with more leatherbound books
here are the trade newspapers you wanted
clay takes the books opens one
whale eats lunch off a tv tray
his attention remains focused on queen for a day as hanna clomps into the room behind him
who was that at the door
his face registers surprise when he sees clay
thank you hanna
that will be all
hanna retreats toward the kitchen
clay steps tentatively into the room
youre not due to cut the lawn until wednesday
id like to sit for you again
but only if you ease up on the locker room talk
whale holds up two fingers affects an american accent
whale and boone are back in their familiar positions
an empty glass of beer sits on the floor next to clay
im curious mr
what convinced you to come back
i dont know
i guess i like your stories
everybody has stories to tell
what about your stint in korea
im sure it was full of dramatic episodes
i told you
i dont like to talk about that
whale nods sensing that hes touched a sore spot
and the fear you showed at our last session
how did you overcome that
more like disgust
same difference mr
disgust fear of the unknown all part of the great gulf that stands between us
am i right in assuming that youve had little experience with men of my persuasion
theres no people like you in my crowd
no teammates in football
no comrades in korea
you must think the whole world is queer
well its not
war sure isnt
oh there may not be atheists in the foxholes but there are occasionally lovers
youre talking through your hat now
not at all
i was in the foxholes myself
you were a soldier
i was an officer
clay breaks his pose to turn and look at whale
this was world war i
no my dear
the crimean war
what do you think
the great war
you had a good war while we had whale clears his throat bored by his standard line
a war without end
there were trenches when i arrived and trenches when i left two years later
just like in the movies
only the movies never get the stench of them
the world reduced to mud and sandbags and a narrow strip of rainy sky
a dry snort but we were discussing something else
love in the trenches
now hes talking only to himself
was that his name
he came to the front straight from harrow
and he looked up to me
unlike the others he didnt care that i was a workingman impersonating his betters
how strange to be admired so blindly
i suppose he loved me
but chastely like a schoolboy
something happened to him
whale looks up at clay stares at him
i remember one morning in particular
a morning when the sun came out
leonard barnett boyish and handsome peers into a periscope
whale stands beside him pointing out landmarks on the bleak landscape
odd how even there one could have days when the weather was enough to make one happy
he and i were standing on the fire step and i showed him the sights of no mans land through the periscope
it was beautiful
the barbed wire was reddish gold the water in the shell holes green with algae the sky a clear quattrocento blue
and i stood shoulder to shoulder with a tall apple cheeked boy who loved and trusted me
whale reaches over and lays his arm across barnetts shoulder
barnett smiles timidly at him
we cut to whale leans forward completely disoriented
his eyes fix on clay the white eyebrows screwed down until he is able to recognize the face
dont do this to me again mr
i absolutely refuse
whale stands his legs shaky
you will not set me on another walk down memory lane
not this lane
i didnt why do i tell you this
i never told david
i never even remembered it until you got me going
youre the one who started it
youre very clever mr
you just sit there and let me talk
what a sorry old man youre thinking
what a crazy old poof
comes closer why are you here
what do you want from me
you asked me to model
of course i remember
do you think im so senile whale stands over clay
his pale face turns left right looking at clay with one cold eye then the other
clay returns the gaze worried for whale
are you okay
whale turns away
he yanks out a handkerchief
what have i been thinking
he sits on the daybed and bends over covering both eyes with the handkerchief
why dont you go
i dont get it
first you creep me out with homo shit
then you hit me with war stories
and now youre upset because i listen
what do you want
i want i want
his pained eyes focus on clay and soften
i want a glass of water
clay gets up and goes to the sink
a touch of headache
clay hands him the water
whale sets the glass down and sits with his head lowered his body folded like a bundle of sticks
i had no business snapping at you
no harm done
it was foolishness to attempt this portrait
you cannot force what will not flow
you dont want me to sit for you anymore
whale shakes his head sadly
he gazes up at clay sees the disappointment on his face
how would you like to come to a party with me
a reception for princess margaret
i thought you werent going
if you dont mind driving id like to take you as my guest
there should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused
very good clayton
may i call you clayton
or do you prefer boone
clayton is fine
whale smiles gently
the sun is setting over the pacific
clay stands in a phone booth on the strand
clay smiles anxiously as the call connects
yeah its me
clay pauses as his mother shoots questions at him
no im not in jail
i dont want any money no
louder to be heard look is sis there
i want to tell her about this movie person i met out here
shell get a kick out of it
we hear the phrase shes out clay
clay closes his eyes as his mother rambles on
no i still
id give you my phone number if i had a phone clay tries to stay calm as his mother berates him for not staying in touch
hows the old man
before clay can protest we hear hold on
clay glances out at couples strolling up the promenade
an operator interrupts says one dollar for the next three minutes
clay deposits two quarters before his mother returns
hes busy clay
the operator comes on again asking for fifty more cents
clay stares at the quarters in his hand
i better go
clay listens as his mother prattles on until the connection is broken and the phone goes dead
clay steps out of the booth takes a deep breath of ocean air
whale and hanna go through the closet together
he is an interesting friend
id hardly call our yardman a friend
but someone you can talk to
whale stops turns to hanna
do you miss having someone to talk to hanna
i have my family
also our lord jesus christ
how is the old boy these days
the naughty remark is met with a solemn stare
whale reaches up chooses a lightweight blue suit
it needs a hat
there was a wide brimmed cream fedora
it must be up in your old room
i will look
the phone rings
hanna hurries to answer it
hanna speaks softly in hungarian
whale points upstairs to let her know he will look for the hat himself
whale opens the closet door and takes down a stack of hatboxes from the overhead shelf
he opens the first box takes out a rubbery wad of heavy fabric with two round windows like eyes
its a gas mask
we cut to the night sky explodes with light and smoke
whale moves calmly through the chaos trying to maintain a modicum of order among the troops
gas masks on
gas masks on
at the end of the line young barnett is struggling with his straps
mustard gas is starting to stream into the trench
dont mind me lieutenant
whale slips the mask over barnetts face fastens it
he slides his own mask into position moments before the trench is obliterated by the yellowish smoke
we cut to hanna stands in the door with a forlorn frown
you make a mess of it
hanna lifts the lid of an unopened box to show him the missing fedora
stacking boxes that is my daughter
she say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon
i am sorry mr
i will make it short
ill be out this afternoon remember
your family can visit as long as they like
i do not cook for them
my daughters no good husband will not take one bite of our food
hanna holds out the box for the gas mask
whale gives it a long final look then drops it in the box
you can toss this one in the trash
hanna clamps the lid on the box
hanna has opened the door
at the end of the hall silhouetted against the bright afternoon sky is clay
his shoulders fill the doorway
the top of his head is perfectly flat
good afternoon clayton
do i look okay
clay steps into the light
his khaki pants are clean and pressed
a blue knit shirt fits his muscles snugly
you look splendid my boy
whale crosses to the passenger side of the chrysler
i suppose youd like the top down
if thats okay
nothing would please me more
clay squeezes behind the wheel shifts the seat back explores switches
the vinyl top pops up and folds backward
whale gets in
clay starts the engine and backs out
hanna stands at the front door hands tangled in her apron
whale tugs his hat brim at her as the car swings around the driveway
whale smiles at the wide open sky overhead
clay steps on the gas and the chrysler takes off
the party is clearly audible from the road where clay has squeezed the chrysler into a long row of shiny cars nuzzling the high brick wall
whale puts his dark glasses on
stars you know
the suns of other galaxies
they walk up the steep road to the gatehouse
good old george
he loves to put on the dog
only his dogs tend to have a bit of mutt
a woman at the gate inspects the invitation waves them through
a sunny patio with hedges and statues
wickets and stakes have been set up for a game of croquet but only a handful of very tanned children strut around with mallets
what did i tell you
i dont hear anything
cukor was too cheap to hire music
theres nothing but chin wag
the cold dreary custard of english chin wag
whale scans the crowd
well its early yet
perhaps this is a good time to pay our respects
clay follows whale toward a trellis alcove covered in ivy
a handful of people grin at the mismatched couple who stand in the shade a homely older man in glasses and a pretty woman in a white dress with polka
george cukor and lets get this over with quickly
whale forgets to remove his hat when he comes forward
before he can give cukor their names princess margarets polite smile bursts open in a joyful display of teeth
i had no idea youd be here
she seizes whales hand in her little white gloves
how are you
taken aback fine
and your royal highness
now that i know youre around
standing beside him clay is clearly impressed that whale knows a princess
can we get together while im in town
i so badly want to sit for you again
ive changed my hair you see
since our last session
those old snaps look rather dowdy now
whale realizes shes mistaken him for someone else
he tugs his sunglasses down his nose so she can see his eyes
have i made a blunder
maam the pleasure is all mine
laughs i am such a goose
i mistook you for cecil beaton
its the hat
youre wearing one of cecils hats you know
whale attempts to chuckle while he fights a feeling of humiliation
he turns to cukor for help
david lewiss friend
i once made pictures myself maam
one cant throw a rock in this town without hitting one of us old movie directors
whale feels the sting
he turns to clay
maam may i present mr
clay steps forward to shake hands
my gardener who insisted i bring him today
he so wanted to meet royalty
cukors face goes blank with indignation
pleased to meet you
i adore gardens
whale narrows his eyes at cukor and sharpens his smile
hes never met a princess
cukor puffs out his chest quivers a bulbous lower lip at whale
george maam this has been an honor
an occasion to remember for the rest of my days
he leads clay away and an american couple promptly crowd in to take their place
striding through the garden whale is obviously pleased with himself
what was that about
nothing of importance
just two old men slapping each other with lilies
shall we have a drink
whale leads clay to a tented bar
across the way david lewis has come through the gate with a woman on his arm
people look discreetly not at david but at the woman lightly veiled in a scarf and sunglasses
the friend i thought was in new york
clay watches in amazement as elizabeth taylor waves to someone and pipes out a happy hello
she hurriedly unties her scarf thrusts it at david and runs off on tiptoes to embrace a woman
is that really her
david produced her last picture
david glances around while he slips the scarf into a coat pocket
he sees whale looking at him
he puts on a tight smile and strolls across the patio
what are you doing here
just what i was about to ask you
i thought you were in new york
i was until last night
publicity asked me to fly miss taylor in for todays reception
the waiter arrives with their drinks
only when clay takes his glass of beer does david see that whale is not alone
who was kind enough to serve as my escort to georges little do
whale lifts his martini glass at clay and takes a sip
should you be drinking in your condition
oh david stop being a nanny
clay clears his throat eager to escape this domestic squabble
i think ill go look at elizabeth taylor
he hurries off
you should have seen georgies face when he met clayton
you didnt jimmy
but princess margaret was a doll
were all equals in her eyes
as commoners i presume
you only embarrass yourself
ill never work in this town again
you know what i mean
but i have no reputation
im as free as the air
well the rest of us arent
cant you remember that
i never could
you must regret having had the invitation sent
david is looking over whales shoulder
i didnt ask george to invite you
then who did
jimmy there are people here i need to speak to
youll be fine on your own
all right then
ill come by tomorrow for breakfast
whale nods watches david stroll over to the pool and greet a gaggle of executives
whale drifts toward some deck chairs at the far end of the croquet lawn
he sits takes a sip of his drink
suddenly a high pitched giggle pierces the air
whale looks out to see edmund kay his interviewer from several weeks ago marching across the lawn
bet you thought youd never see me again
i didnt know if youd be well enough to come to this party
im the one who got you on mr
cukors guest list
how do you know george cukor
i interviewed him after i met you
im his social secretary now
well assistant to his secretary
i commend you
if youre going to pursue poofs go after those who can do favors for you
you waste everybodys time when you court dinosaurs
dont think that mr
i love your movies
thats why i wanted you to come to this
so i could see you with your monsters
dont go away
whale tries to do just that but finds himself caught in the chair
he is stumbling to his feet when kay returns with elsa lanchester at his side
how are you
she takes whales hand with a look of deep concern and sympathy
kay races off again
i saw una oconner a few weeks ago
she said youd been under the weather
oh nothing out of the ordinary
were all getting a bit long in the tooth
but you appear quite fresh my dear
she swats aside the compliment and gestures at the chair
you shouldnt stand on my account
perfectly all right
but if youd like to sit im fine jimmy
i can only stay a few minutes
whats our pesky friend up to now
kay returns accompanied by a stopped gray haired man with a long rectangular face and wary heavy lidded eyes
is that boris
our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion
karloff age comes reluctantly followed by his niece alice a bashful young woman who carried a blanket wrapped bundle
i didnt know you were here
these public revels are hardly up your alley
i came for the sake of my visiting niece
and miranda my great niece
his huge hand lifts the blanket in alices arms revealing a bald infant with enormous blue eyes
karloff gurgles and coos at the child
and what do you make of our royal visitant
a real lady
of course shes a lady
what did you expect
a hussy in tennis shoes
whale looks up and discovers clay standing a few feet behind karloff
he is ogling two bosomy actresses who are listening intently to the monocled british consul
whales eyes try to focus karloff and clay together his once and future monsters
kay shouts to a passing photographer carrying a bulky speed graphic
with the camera
we got a historical moment here
come get a picture of it
the man scans the scene for a famous face
this is mr
james whale who made frankenstein and bride of frankenstein
and this is the monster and his bride
clay looks up when he hears kay identify karloff
karloff and elsa drift into position next to whale
the flash goes off a snap and a crunch of light
whale cringes in pain
through clenched teeth dont you just love being famous
from whales perspective the bulb resembles nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical current from dr
whale concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his brain
he clutches elsa lanchesters hand
are you all right jimmy
a sharp nod from whale
the photographer motions to karloffs niece
let me get one with frankenstein holding the kid
alice hands over the baby
karloff gently cradles the child
whale stands on his left elsa on his right
they all smile at the baby who gurgles and points up
whale follows the babys gaze to the sky where a large kite rocks and strains in a furious electrical storm
the camera flashes once then again
whale glances up the kite is gone
thunder rumbles as the group starts to disperse
whale nods to the faces exchanging good byes
so good to see you again james
he strolls off clucking and cooing at his baby
catch you before you go mr
ill make sure everybody gets sent a print
he goes off with the photographer
elsa kisses whale on the cheek
well be in touch jimmy
so nice to see you
finally whale is alone
he staggers to the deck chair and lowers himself sideways into the lawn chair
whale gazes up at clay
a bit tired
whale smiles at him
are you enjoying yourself
i feel a little out of place
neither of us really belongs here
must have been funny for you
seeing your monsters again
the only monsters
closes his eyes are here
across the lawn conversation has stopped
birdlike shrieks come from all directions
and we left the top down
you want to run for it
run for what
cant you see
the rain is only a flickering of air but people are jumping and shrieking throwing coats over their heads as they dash toward the house
he takes whale under the arm helps him up and escorts him to a small tent
on the patio everyone shoves and squeezes to get through the one open door
whale stares out hypnotized by the deluge
from his pov we see a young man step into the rain
whale squints is finally able to identify the man as leonard barnett
whales eyes follow barnett as he emerges onto a new landscape a scarred and barren battlefield
as the storm continues to rage mr
whale shifts his gaze to clay
he takes a moment to orient himself
lets get out of this funk hole you dont want to wait it out
rain should let up soon
were not sugar
we wont melt
whale adjusts the brim of his hat and steps into the downpour
clay has no choice except to follow
they walk briskly the minute splashes on whales hat forming a ghostly aura of spray
whale opens the door and climbs in next to clay
the roof slowly closes over them
i better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia
catch my death
clay glances over sees whale sitting very wet and rigid staring straight ahead
you all right mr
whale blinks slowly turns
there is a cracked look in his eyes
call me jimmy
clay smiles starts to back the car out
the hallway is pitch dark as whale and clay enter
bring us some towels
were drenched to the bone
if we soil her holy floor its her own damn fault
whale goes squashing down the hall
clay remains just inside the open door prying off his shoes and peeling off his socks
he follows whale into whale stands over the table with his jaw open
i dont believe this
he slides a note to clay
its not like her
reading just a night out
sounds like she cant say no to her daughter
certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man
lets get dry
whale stands just inside the closet buttoning a crisp white shirt
he reaches for a red bow tie closes the closet door
in the mirror leonard barnett stands behind him in uniform
whales eyes twinkle in surprise
he drapes the tie around his collar
what do you think
barnett smiles his approval
clay opens the bathroom door calls out
he goes to the top of the stairs and calls out
wheres those clothes you promised
rain ticks against the windows
clay goes down the stairs
whale fiddles with the knot of his tie
he trusts me you know
barnett sits on the edge of the bed now
he smiles a bit sadly
theres glow coming from the bedroom and the sound of whales voice
clay steps slowly toward the door pushes it open
he peers in
whale pulls on a blazer
he slaps a hand over his chest twists around sees clay
oh of course
you finished your shower already
ten minutes ago
didnt you hear me calling
im afraid not
stands i believe i promised you some clothes
whale crosses to the closet
barnett is nowhere to be seen
youre much wider than i am
you wont want to attempt to get into my pants
very good clayton
he takes a robe from a hook on the closet door
clay tries it on but it wont close over the towel
whale opens a drawer takes out a crewneck sweater
absolutely swims on me but should take care of your upper half
clay pulls the sweater over his head
that only leaves the rest
you dont have any baggy shorts
my pajamas are tailored
would it be too distressing to continue with the towel
no more immodest than a kilt you know
do i have any other choice
very sporting of you clayton
clay notices a framed drawing on the desk
nods the only memento i ever kept
my original sketch for the monster
he hands the sketch to clay who stares down at the famous flat head hooded eyes bolted neck of the monster
clay puts down the sketch starts into the hall
whale turns back sees barnett standing by the window
whale flips off the light and closes the door
clay sits at the kitchen table
whale opens the refrigerator and brings out two plates wrapped in wax paper and a bottle of beer for clay
he pours himself a shot of scotch from a decanter and sits down
after dinner if hanna isnt back
can we try a few more sketches
i thought youd given up on my picture
id like to try again
if youre game
give us something to do while we wait
clay munches on his sandwich
whale pours himself another scotch takes a sip
tell me something clayton
do you believe in mercy killing
never gave it much thought
im sure you came across such situations in korea
a wounded comrade or perhaps one of the enemy
someone for whom death would be a blessing
clay stops chewing
he stares down at his plate
i never went
he takes a deep breath looks up at whale
i never made it to korea
but you said that i was a marine
which is true
you filled in the rest
clay downs his beer refills the glass
my old man was a marine
he enlisted the day he turned seventeen
the great war
nods by the time he was ready to ship out the fighting was over
he missed out
a very lucky thing indeed
thats not the way he saw it
to him it was like his life never got started
nothing else really mattered
definitely not his family
whale gazes sympathetically at clay
the morning after pearl harbor he drove down to st
louis to reenlist
he was so damn excited
world war ii was going to be his second chance
sighs they told him he was too old
said hed be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family
is that why you joined the marines
for your fathers sake
i figured hed think you know it was the next best thing
hey i loved it too
a chance to be a part of something important
something bigger than yourself
i didnt have the guts for it
a look of surprise crosses whales face
i mean literally
my body screwed me up
they gave me a medical discharge
all i thought about was how am i going to tell the old man
he breaks into a crooked smile
you know what he did when i called him
he laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel
said it was a good lesson for me
not to try to fill his shoes
im very sorry
thems the breaks right
no war stories for this pup
thats where youre wrong clayton
youve just told one
a very good story indeed
whale lifts his glass in a toast
clay empties his glass of beer
he motions toward the decanter
do you mind
not at all
he hands the decanter to clay
clay sits in a straight backed chair smoking a cigarette and sipping his scotch
whale sketches from a wing chair across the room
storms getting worse
a perfect night for mystery and horror
the air itself is filled with monsters
thats from your movie right
the only monsters are here
i dont remember that one
this afternoon at the party
whale looks up
i said it must be weird seeing your monsters again and you said the only monsters are here
i was wondering which here you meant
i dont recall
memories of the war perhaps
but that was so long ago
it cant still bother you
oh but it does
especially in light of the journey im about to make
youre planning a trip
whales gaze remains dreamy and preoccupied as sounds of battle fill the room
a relentless rat a tat of gunfire
the whistling of bombs
the tortured wailing of dying men
whale stands moves over to the window
barnett on the wire
whale gazes out at the storm
from his pov we see a scarred and barren landscape illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning
he caught his one night coming back from the reconnoiter
i wouldnt take him out but mcgill did
just to give the lad a taste
they were nearly home when a maxim gun opened fire
we race along the open trench with whale the darkened sky intermittently punctured by bursts of gunfire
he reaches the periscope pulls an enlisted man off it
from his pov we see barnett and mcgill dodging bullets as they attempt to make their way back
through clenched teeth come on
mcgill leaps over the barbed wire of a forward trench
just as his feet leave the ground his chest is riddled by a fresh round of gunfire
whales eyes snap closed trying to obliterate what theyve just seen
barnetts body fell in wire as thick as briers
it was hanging there the next morning a hundred yards from the line too far out for anyone to fetch it
whale stares out impassively
we saw him at morning stand to and evening stand to
good morning barnett wed say each day
hows ole barnett looking this morning
seems a little peaky
looks a little plumper
his wounds faced the other way and his hat shielded his eyes so one could imagine he was napping on bedsprings
he hung there until we were relieved
we introduced him to the new unit before we marched out speaking highly of his companionship
clays eyes are filled with pity
oh but we were a witty lot
laughing at our dead
telling ourselves it was our death too
but with each man who died i thought better you than me poor sod
bitterly a whole generation was wiped out by that war
millions and millions of young men
whale begins to hum a tune we have heard before oh death where is thy sting a ling
grave where thy victory
you survived it
it cant hurt you now
its no good to dig it up
oh no my friend
its digging itself up
there is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it
all my diversions have abandoned me
all gone to me now
whale remains perfectly still staring out the window
clay deliberates a moment then puts down his drink next to the decanter of scotch
he stands and yanks the neck of the sweater over his face then tosses it on the sofa
whale blinks at the reflection in the glass not yet understanding
you wanted to draw me like a greek statue
all right then
clay pulls at the knot lets go of the towel
he defiantly parks his hands on his hips
not so bad
whale continues to stare at the reflection his back to clay his eyes wide and expressionless
he turns slowly fully expecting the vision to evaporate
when he sees that clay is truly naked he mutters softly under his breath
so it is going to happen after all
whatd you say
whale doesnt respond
finally he opens his mouth to take a breath
it wont do
what wont do
you are much too human
what did you expect
whale moves abruptly across the room
he walks past clay
whale passes quickly through the dining room and out to the kitchen
whale reaches for the hatbox which sits on top of a garbage can
suddenly a large hand appears on the box
whale gasps when a flash of lightning reveals the face of the monster
the monster growls out an inarticulate greeting
he picks up the box and hands it to whale
whale removes the lid sets the hatbox on the sofa
i would like you to wear this
whale steps back
clay takes the box and covers his lap with it
he lifts out the gas mask
for the artistic effect
the combination of your human body and that inhuman mask
its quite striking
i dont know
just for a minute
long enough for me to see the effect
its from the first world war isnt it
nods there are straps in back
clay fits the mask on the top of his head and draws it down
the living room turns brownish yellow in the thick glass goggles
let me help you
whale is suddenly behind him
clays vision is enclosed in two round windows so he cant see whale buckling the second strap
mouth muffled by the inhalator clay hears his voice from inside his head
whale comes around to stand in front of him
he grins as he steps back to examine clay
clay nervously taps his knees with his hands
lets take it off now
what was that
its too tight
clay raises his voice to make himself heard
he reaches back to undo the buckles
whale steps in past the goggles
we dont want to tear the straps
clay drops his hands so whale can undo the buckles
but nothing happens
clay turns left and right
i am still here
two hands grip clays shoulders
what steely muscles clayton
whales hands squeeze
clay grabs the frame of his seat to stop his arms from automatically swinging a fist
whales hand slides over clays shoulder to his arm caressing the tattoo
clay jerks his shoulder to shake whale off
just take off the fucking mask
i cant hear you
i cant hear a word
whale presses his lips to clays tattoo
clays muscles tense from head to toe
what a solid brute you are
whales tongue moves down clays arm
maybe this then
the hand slides over clays stomach toward his lap
the tattooed arm swings backward slamming an elbow against whales skull
clay jumps from the chair knocking into an end table
the glass and crystal decanter fall to the floor
the lamp spills over and the room goes dark
clays ankle is caught by the sofa leg and he hits the floor jamming the inhalator against his mouth
he quickly gets up on his knees and elbows pulling at the mask
flashes of lightning strobe the room as whale collapses over clays back and holds on
i have you now
a strap breaks
clay rips the mask off
get the fuck off
whales hand squeezes between clays legs
what will you do to get yourself back
clay jabs with his elbow flipping whale on his back
his body straddles whales and pins him face to face
im not that way
get it through your fucking head
i dont want to mess with you
oh but you feel good clayton
his hands clasp clays hips
clays fist opens as it comes down he slaps whale across the face
that didnt even sting
youre not such a real man after all
clay whacks whales face again
wait until i tell my friends i had you naked in my arms
wont they be surprised
i havent done a damn thing with you
oh but you have
you undressed for me
i kissed you
i even touched your prick
how will you be able to live with yourself
clay snatches whales wrist before it can touch his crotch
with his other hand he picks up the heavy crystal decanter
what the hell do you want from me
whale tilts his face up for another blow
i want you to kill me clay freezes
he stares down at the old man with white hair and wild eyes lying beneath him
break my neck
or strangle me
it would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me
weve come this far
whales eyes glimmer in the sporadic bursts of lightning
exactly im losing my mind
every day another piece goes
soon there will be nothing left
look at the sketch i made of you
clay turns to the sketch pad which lies on the floor next to whale
the page is filled with nothing but doodles and scrawls
look if you want to die do it yourself
no i dont want to die alone
but to be killed by you that would make death bearable
they say you never see the one with your name on it
but i want to see death coming at me
i want it to be sharp and hard with a human face
youd be my second monster
almost as famous as the first
it would be the great adventure youve yearned for
a war story for both of us to share
clays breathing comes in quick panicked bursts
youd be fully exonerated ive taken care of that
i wrote a note ill even leave you the house the car
clays body starts to tremble
do it now clayton
make me invisible
clay lets out a howl his shoulders heave and shake
i am not your monster
he climbs off whale crawls away his body collapsing in wracking anguished sobs
whale opens his eyes gazes at clay
what have i done
sits up oh selfish selfish fool
i have lost my mind
he forces himself to his feet
what was i thinking
whale picks up the towel and moves over to clay
youre a softhearted bloke
a bloody pussycat
whale places the towel around clays shoulders
my deepest apologies
can you ever forgive me
clay doesnt look up
i suppose not
a bone crushing sigh good god i am tired
i really must go to bed
whale starts slowly down the hall
whale sits on the edge of the bed tugs the bowtie from his collar
clay taps on the door opens it
did i hurt you
nothing i didnt deserve
need some help
pray you undo this button
he lifts his chin and points to his collar
i can never manage it when im tired
clay leans in to open the button
his face is only six inches from whales
do you believe people come into our lives for a reason
clay doesnt answer
whale turns breaking their shared gaze
i can undress myself thank you
steps back all right
whale hauls his legs up and stretches out on the bed
when you die
be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle youll feel better tomorrow
tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
whale smiles fondly at him
clay pulls the door shut and it clicks
he stands there a moment
clay shakes open a bedsheet and wraps himself in it
clay finds a pack of cigarettes on the floor and lights one then sets the furniture back up
he picks up the gas mask from beside the sofa shoves it into its box
clay sits in the wing back chair props his feet on the hassock adjusting the sheet around his shoulders
we cut whale bolts up in bed
an electrical storm flashes and cracks in the window
whale gets out of bed stares outside
from his pov the lawn is a barren slope covered with stumps
whale turns on the desk lamp sits
he pulls out a piece of paper
were back to the scene that opened the movie a flat topped creature stumbling through the mud
a flash of lightning reveals clays face
he turns signals for whale to follow him
whale joins clay on a slight rise of ground the rim of a crater
clay points down into it
the crater is full of bodies gathered around a pool of water
whale stumbles down reaches the bottom and bends over the nearest corpse in khaki
it is leonard barnett
there are no wounds on his body no rips or gaping holes
his eyes are closed in dreamless sleep
whale looks up and sees that clay is gone
the only other living creature is an owl which blinks wearily at him
whale lies down finding a spot next to barnett
he takes a last breath and closes his eyes
we cut to a roar of bells blasts clay awake
the telephone is ringing
a hard pair of shoes thunder out to answer it
clay blinks at the sight of hanna in black dress and white apron chattering on the phone by the far wall
no no he did not tell me
but no problem
i will make breakfast
she scoldingly cuts her eyes at clay
very good then
she hangs up and faces clay with a stern frown
its not what you think
i have brought you your clothes
all i ask is that you get dressed and go
we are having a guest for breakfast
i need to talk to you about mr
there is nothing you can say that will surprise me
but i still need to talk
do i have time for a cup of coffee before i go
i blame my daughter for keeping me out so late
i only hope you did not get him excited
it could give him a new stroke
she stomps into the kitchen
clay gets up slips on his undershorts
hes zipping up his chinos when she comes out again with a breakfast tray
she hands him a cup of coffee
quickly why do you do it
what do i do
take care of mr
whale like he was your flesh and blood
it is my job
i did it when he was happy and it was easy
it is only fair i do it now when he is ill
picks up the tray enough talk
i must wake up the master
she marches around the corner towards whales bedroom
clay hears her knocking on a door
clay pulls on his shirt
hanna comes back around the corner
what have you done with him
i put him to bed
hes not there
she goes to the foot of the stairs and shouts mr
hanna starts up the stairs
look for him
clay reaches for his socks when he notices an envelope on the floor next to the chair
he picks it up
on the front is scrawled the word clayton
clay opens the envelope
inside is whales original sketch of the monsters head
he turns it over
there is a message written on the back
clay drops the sketch looks out
he sees something
clay crosses the patio hurtles down the slope
clay leaps headfirst into the water
whale rests lightly on his back with an upward sway of straight white hair
clay hauls the body toward the side
he gets an arm around whales chest and heaves the body over the curb
he climbs out drags the body forward to rest in the grass
he grabs the wrist
son of a bitch
you crazy son of a bitch
clay straddles whales thighs and applies pressure on his rib cage
but its no use
clay sits up and takes a deep breath
hanna comes down the path her run slowing to a walk
she stares at clay
i didnt do it
this wasnt me
he wanted me to kill him but i didnt
he did it himself
he says here good bye
i find it in his room
he is sorry he says
he has had a wonderful life
she waves a folded piece of paper
you poor foolish man
you couldnt wait for god to take you in his time
clay slowly stands up
hanna looks around in panic
you must leave
you were not here this morning
but i didnt do this
the police will not know that
they will want to investigate
we have his note
do you want to be questioned about you and mr
it will be better if i find the body alone
but howre you going to explain this
points at the body how did you get him out of the pool
you are right
we must put him back
they both hesitate looking down at whale
then clay drags the body parallel with the pool
hanna stoops over to adjust the collar of whales shirt
we do not mean disrespect
you will keep better in water
she nods to clay
he rolls the body over and it splashes on its belly
it bounces a moment in the waves of the splash then begins to sink
as it drops the air in the chest slowly flips the body around
looking up at them with open eyes whale sinks backward into the thickening light
his arms trail upward and the hands lightly flutter as if waving good bye
the melancholy sound of a solo violin pierces the silence as we cut to a black and white scene from bride of frankenstein
the old blind man plays a mournful lullaby on his violin while the monster listens outside moved by the music
he smashes open the door of the hut in an effort to get closer to the soul soothing sound
the blind man stops playing looks up
who is it
youre welcome my friend whoever you are
the monster attempts to communicate manages only a plaintive moan
the blind man stands
i cannot see you
i cannot see anything
you must please excuse me
but i am blind
the monster holds out his burned hands
come in my poor friend
no one will hurt you here
if youre in trouble perhaps i can help you
the old man touches the monster who recoils with a defensive growl
can you not speak
perhaps youre afflicted too
i cannot see and you cannot speak
michael boone lies on the living room carpet staring raptly at the movie playing on the large zenith console
the house is small but tidy and comfortable
its been a long time since any human being came into this hut
i shall look after you
and you will comfort me
on the tv screen the old man starts to cry then collapses onto the monsters chest
a thick tear rolls down the monsters cheek
clay boone sits on the sofa a baby on his lap
hes now his hair starting to thin but still closely cropped at the top and sides
on the tv daylight fills the hut
the blind man and the monster share a meal
we are friends you and i
before you came i was all alone
it is bad to be alone
he takes the old mans hand
the blind man nods
on the sofa clay watches his son watch the movie
a color promo for chiller theater fills the screen
clay turns off the set
time for bed sport
michael groans slowly stands
whatd you think of the movie
better than most monster movies
i knew the guy who made it
michael glances skeptically at his father
come on dad
is this another one of your stories
clay unfolds whales sketch of the monster hands it to his son
its his original sketch of the monster
michael turns over the sketch
on the back scrawled in block letters to clayton boone friend
this is for real
at the same time his wife dana appears in the doorway
a pretty cheerful woman in her mid s
the trash clay
before it rains
clay kisses the top of his sons head
off to bed
clay carries a large metal bin down the tidy lawn
the sky momentarily brightens with a silent flash of lightning
clay gazes up at the electrical storm
he glances back at his house sees dana cradling the baby in an upstairs window
the skies open with a shattering crash of thunder
clay tilts up his face drinks in the cool rain
then he extends his arms and staggers along the sidewalk imitating the monsters famous lurch
we pull back revealing a sleepy neighborhood of small houses and neat lawns until clay is only a small dot in the landscape
