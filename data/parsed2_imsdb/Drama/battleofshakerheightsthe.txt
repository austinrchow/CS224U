written by erica beeney muffled by the wet green forest
the very earth seems to tremble
darts out of a log lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs the air
voices and shouts closer now mix with the rumbling war sounds in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion
a dead american gi lays splayed out careless in death
a pair of soldiers flash among the trees running hunched over and low and disappear into the gray blooms of smoke
for a moment the forest takes a breath
nothing but trembling leaves
then the rattle of a jeep coming closer in fits and starts grinding through low gears
a willys mb appears crashing through the undergrowth
its driven by private first class kelly ernswiler
eighteen if that
not much meat on him
his insignias indicate hes in the th infantry
his face might be attractive under other conditions
he pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his m standard issue field jacket
where the hell are those krauts
to give himself courage he sings tommy dorseys ill be seeing you in all the old familiar places while maneuvering the jeep through the bushes and rocks
he drives straight for a fallen log guns the engine and tries to go over it
the jeeps front wheels catch on the log
the back tires spin
kelly gets out
takes off his m combat helmet and wipes his face
assesses the situation
he grabs a branch
jams it under the wheel trying to lever the jeep free
when the stutter of a nearby machine gun startles him
the branch snaps against kellys weight
he slips and falls in the mud
determined he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on foot through the forest
kelly strides purposefully out of the woods
pauses against a split rail fence beneath the innocent sun
across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned barn
but not for long as two german infantrymen appear around the corner of it
kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation
unaware the germans smoke and talk
kellys too far away to hear them but he watches their every move
theyre relaxed not as on guard as they should be
their karabiners rest slung across their backs
kelly focuses himself
then he shoulders his carbine
pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly
and so they buried hector breaker of horses
he takes his smith wesson pistol from his pistol belt and steps out into the sunlight field in plain sight of the guards
surely he knows they can see him
he must want them to see him
but they dont
too busy passing nudie wallet photos
halfway across the open grass kelly raises the pistol but does not aim it
just strides steadily closer arms spread out making himself an easy target
crazy as it seems private kelly ernswiler is trying to get himself killed
kelly pauses not twenty feet from the germans fires into the air and waves when from behind him comes a voice
eine maus findet den kase
kelly whips around to face a third german the officer
his pistol points right into the officers shocked pink young face
point blank range
only kelly doesnt fire
he just lowers the pistol
the german smiles
kill me adolf
the infantrymen have recovered from their idle and come running
one of them yanks kellys hands behind his back and pushes him into the barn roughly
kelly doesnt struggle
hey siegfreid and roy
what are you waiting for
kelly sits slumped in a chair legs tied up
one of the germans shines a flashlight in his face
come on you pussies
lets get this over with
the german officer produces a piece of paper and a fountain pen
german accent you will write your mother
tell her how you will die now
kelly takes the pen and examines it
genuine third reich issue no less
the officer pokes the paper
you will write
how you die alone
my mother and i dont have that kind of relationship
kelly thinks about it for a minute should he or shouldnt he but sighs and begins writing
after a few lines the officer snatches the paper away and passes it to an infantryman
now you will beg for your life
what dont you understand
interrupts sheepishly in german accent the protocol says we should the officer wheels around and scowls at the speaker
he seems to be getting a bit hysterical
i am the fucking protocol
to kelly beg
he and kelly glare at each other
the officer fires his luger into the rafters
beg for your life
you got to be kidding me
the officer grabs his throat
now i have a little fun
the officer slaps him
kelly jerks away
now thats against the rules
sneers there are no rules in war
suddenly another american gi appears behind the german in the shadows
only kelly can see him
the gi motions to kelly keep talking while he gets into a better position with his m rifle
to officer youve never killed anyone before have you
i shower in the blood of my victims the gi shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated pain and commence death throes
quick as a flash the gis colt pistol is at the german officers neck his m in his other hand
no wonder you smell so bad
dont shoot please
the gis eyes widen
he looks at kelly
will you look at the manners on this guy
to german remember to thank me when i kill you
no really not in the neck but the gi does anyway
the officer shrieks grabs at his neck and falls
to kelly you all right
my elaborate death scene wasnt going anywhere anyway
you want me to give you a minute
theyll get me eventually
if you cant get killed in a war when can you
look on the bright side
the gi holds out his hand
kelly takes the hand of the grinning all american type guy
about his own age but bart takes up more space
i mean thats irish right
from the floor now with a decidedly american accent wow man this is a really beautiful scene and all but i have to interrupt
to bart why the fuck did you have to shoot that cap so close to my neck
you gave me a powder burn
listen you wienerschnitzel
you should talk
you slapped me
im not your bitch
the officer gets up and dusts off his uniform
well what was that whole creepy death wish thing about
well it didnt work now did it
shrugs sometimes i get so caught up in the moment
and what was that ridiculous shit about making me write to my mother
the officer grins
inspired wasnt it
dude you made him write to his mother
who are you dr
also with american accent can we get up now
bart helps him up and checks his regulation issue timex
might as well
theres only an hour left anyway
the german officer crosses his arms
to kelly admit it
you were scared
kelly gets up from the chair and falls over
his legs are still tied
the dead gi gets up and walks off with the germans and some other soldiers done for the day
bart and kelly walk back to the stranded jeep
that willys yours
just got her
three summers packing out at shop rite
bart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs under the back wheels building up dirt
then he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder against the hood
bart rocks the jeep while kelly pumps the gas
the jeep finally pulls free and sprays bart with mud
kelly looks over his shoulder and starts backing away
bart stands there dripping with mud shocked
about a hundred feet away kelly stops
well come on
bart walks towards the jeep
kelly backs it up again
i couldnt resist
bart climbs in
real funny ernswiler
you might still get your chance to die today
the customers are all reenactors
some yanks some germans a few scottish and north african irregulars
boogie woogie bugle boy plays on the jukebox
bart and kelly sit in a booth together
bart has an easy confident manner and expansive gestures
kelly eats hunched over like someone might try and steal his food
those crazy guys from ann arbor tied them to a dock
shrugs thats what you get for invading wisconsin
d day at kenosha was nothing
at guadalcanal chillicothe there was a guy who actually injected himself with malaria
they both eat for a minute
where do you live anyway
that explains the death wish
chewing hmm dont know it
its not technically in shaker heights but i go to shaker heights high
kelly looks at bart
sorry to hear that
well i got kicked out of shaker heights high because my birdhouse came unglued in honors woodshop
i would have gone to langely myself only my polo pony had the fits
bart throws his napkin on his plate
raises his voice to address the room were all soldiers here
whooping cheers etc
kelly pulls up into the circular gravel drive
barts house is fancy
a nice yard and a pool
bart hops out
you should come over some time
service our lawnmower
i would but then i might soil my croquet whites
kelly watches bart go into his house and smiles in spite of himself
kellys house is a also pretty nice nothing to be ashamed of
it is smaller and weirder
the flowers and bushes are overgrown and strange sculptures dot the yard some leaning at precarious angles
kelly washes his jeep in the driveway
kelly buffs the headlamps with a chamois
the jeep looks good as new
he pulls a canvas cover over it
sleep tight hot lips
kelly walks in on his dad abe making sandwiches
a great big pile of cheese and pb j
how was the war
did we win
kelly doesnt smile at this
he looks at the sandwiches and puts his finger to his chin in a gesture so facetious its downright angry
let me guess
happy meals for the wavy gravy wellness center
abe grabs two pieces of bread from a loaf
he looks kind
a bit ill used by life
the phrase rode hard and put away wet comes to mind
as usual your cynicism is refreshing
he finishes that sandwich and adds it to the pile
kelly pauses while opening the refrigerator
his back tightens
he slams the door with his foot
as usual your cheerful optimism makes me ill
abe pauses over a slice of bread only briefly
the hostility is nothing new
lightly you should get that checked
kelly walks through the kitchen and out the back door
sure thing doc
say hello to leif garrett for me
kelly opens the screen door and pokes his head in
a family of chinese immigrants the lings paints canvases at long worktables
theres a mother father mao grandmother xiou xiou son and daughter
finished canvases hang from the walls and lean in piles against it
all of them are portraits of animals
some have on hats or clothes
kellys mom eve shows grandmother xiou xiou a few strokes with a paintbrush
eve wears jeans
shes one of those young looking mothers kellys friends would have crushes on
if he had any friends
to kelly son of eve
you are very dirty
awkward a rough charge
to kelly dont touch anything
we have to get ready for the starving artist show
to xiou xiou now nana the gold has to be feathery not gloppy see
eve demonstrates on the painting a pair of monkeys in french court dress
kelly looks over his moms shoulder
now you try
grandmother xiou xiou dabs at the painting
to kelly she loves the gold
always overuses it
and usually her touch is so light
gold is the color of the sun
eve moves along the row stopping to look at the paintings in progress
you know why we never have anything to eat in this house
but eve has stopped behind maos painting
shes not paying attention to kelly
mao what did we say about the eyes
she gestures at the image of a horse done santa fe style lots of pastels very abstract
mao looks at her quizzically
and didnt i tell you to put in more cacti
shakes head no no more cacti
simplicity is best
his family nods in support of this rash aesthetic statement
eve rolls her eyes
im not having this battle with you again
kelly breaks in
because your husband takes food from his own family to feed every loser druggie in cleveland
eve moves down the line
well you can always chip in here
were ordering pizza later
at this the family nods and smiles to each other pleased with the news
some people have to work later
casual will you drop something off at the dry cleaners for me tomorrow
eve looks up at him for the first time
takes in his filthy uniform
sweetie you know what we said about paying for the war things
its the only thing i ever ask you for dont be dramatic
but its important to me
eve stops at mother lings painting
youre just going to have to find a way to pay for it yourself then i guess
to mother ling no not that way the sky should be stormier
mother ling looks up at kelly whos scowling
she smiles and nods understanding
why do i bother
eves busy talking
more brown less blue
kelly comes back in a grabs a sandwich off the pile
now keller who needs that sandwich more you or the daughter of a crack addict trying to make a new life
kelly looks at him and bites into the sandwich
how about the son of a heroin addict trying to get ready for work
kelly leaves with the sandwich
abe sighs and picks up more bread
that went well
on the walls a poster for the civil war miniseries next to one of led zeppelin
models of fighter planes and a set of old tin soldiers
oh yeah and his moms original painting the one that started it all this one signed by her a very intense looking pink rabbit glaring out of the canvas with
he sits on the edge of the bed for a minute staring into space before he peels off his muddy uniform piece by piece
ah the graveyard shift
musak steely dan
kelly unpacks cat food
thousands and thousands of little cans of it
its hard to keep the rows straight on the shelves
sarah the night cashier stands at her register
shes plain looking now but shell be beautiful later when she figures out who she is
not another soul in the store
sarah wanders over to kellys aisle as if pulled by a magnet
so howd your battle go today
i still dont understand how you could reenact the battle of the bulge in seventy two degree weather
plays with hair didnt all those guys freeze to death
kelly doesnt stop working
hes got a system
well a port a john fell over on a couple of guys
war is hell
kelly grabs another handful of cans
then why do you do it
he puts two cans on the shelf very deliberately
youre never more alive then when facing simulated death
maybe i should try it
kelly looks at her thinks about this and stands up
you are william j
stone of the st airborne pinned down in noville
the germans have the high ground and theyre shelling your position heavily
starts throwing cans youre holed up in a stone barn
sustaining heavy casualties
running low on ammo
the cries of wounded men fill the air like the cries of hungry babies
sarah covers her head huddled behind the boxes of cat food dodging cans
your commanding officer gets hit in the face dies
you lose radio contact with headquarters
if you withdraw the germans will flank the entire allied forces arrayed along bastogne and break the front
what do you do
what do you do
kelly goes back to stocking satisfied
battle of bulge the southern shoulder december
sorry i asked
sarah stands up and starts to wander away but kelly makes a peace offering
want a snack
we got a whole shipment in of busted oreos
sarah looks at her feet considering whether or not to accept it
ill accidentally drop a couple pints of milk and meet you over there
sarah and kelly sit on milk crates pass the cookies back and forth and get philosophical
the frozen food woman came in with her kids
they must eat out of those little cardboard trays every night
one of the kids looked like cardboard
do you know we stock more flavors of cat food than we do baby food
sixteen flavors of baby food including the toddler meals in ajar thirty one flavors of cat food
he fishes for a cookie
next time you should tell that woman to buy her kid some cat food
an angry woman pushes open the swinging door of the backroom with her loaded shopping cart
is this store open
ive been waiting up front
if the stores closed it shouldnt have a sign that says twenty four hours
sarah gets up
kelly stays right where he is finishing a cookie
sorry about that
i have a lot of coupons and i dont want to be here when they expire
to sarah charge her double for everything
sarah smiles and hurries away
kelly walks down the hall with his army issue backpack slung over one shoulder
besides a serious case of bedhead he looks normal
no one says hi to him as he makes his way to his locker
as he twirls the combination and opens it he notices lance short and wide built like a tank prematurely balding and his girlfriend bridget embracing a few lockers down
they kiss raunchily their tongues darting in and out of each others mouths
lance sees kelly looking and stops kissing
what the fuck are you looking at gi jane
kelly shakes his head and gets a book out of his locker
no really what makes you think you can look at me
i honestly didnt know it was you
i thought it was a free preview of the spice channel
thats pretty funny
you got dental insurance
kelly closes his locker and walks away
bridget wipes her mouth guiltily
lance shakes his head and pulls bridget to him grinding his pelvis against hers
she walks away
the lights are off in history class
the teacher mr
norman shows slides on the civil war
the more we see the clearer it becomes that they are his own photos from a vacation spent visiting the memorials
norman smiles out at his class in shot after shot
he clicks the remote and a photo of his wife crouched over and wearing shorts drinking from a garden hose appears on screen
he hurries through to the next slide
it doesnt matter anyway
everyone is almost asleep
except kelly who becomes increasingly irritated the more mr
and here at gettysburg the ranks of union soldiers fought bravely on
they were willing to give their lives so that others might be free
kelly shifts in his seat
is there a problem mr
norman doesnt start talking again
he waits looking at kelly smiling blandly
until the silence becomes uncomfortable
and kelly gets mad
isnt this analysis a tad simplistic
i mean maybe for a second grade history class sure but to insist on still characterizing the civil war as some moral struggle
the soldiers were drafted the only ones who had to fight were the ones who couldnt afford to pay their way out
losing it why dont you talk about the draft riots
where are your slides for that
fresh flowers and a crocheted tissue box hoodie make the place cozy
kelly sits across the desk from principal holmstead a well groomed woman with a gentle talk show host demeanor
what gives you the idea that you can or ought to question the curriculum
kelly doesnt move
hes not into this
or question your teacher
i mean who ever heard of a classroom dialog
holmstead is exasperated but she likes him in spite of herself
hes a smart cookie
shes got to change her strategy
she leans back in her chair
kelly youre a very bright boy
but youre making some serious mistakes
i dont need to
everyone else makes them for me
her chair squeaks as she leans forward and looks at kelly intently
this anger must be masking a lot of hurt
i was wondering what the tissues were for
holmstead tries again
she looks down at his file
i see youre not going to college next year
what are your plans
holmstead searches his face for any clues
how do i get through to you
advertisers use status and sex to appeal to my demographic
she shakes her head and swings her chair towards the window and gazes out at the front walkway of the school
her face clears
i think we can come up with a punishment which might actually be more of an opportunity for you to realize your true potential
schools been out for a while
the first rush had already left
kelly comes down the front steps and starts across the parking lot to his jeep
lance steps out from behind an suv and intercepts him
you upset bridget
kelly hardly stops walking
give me a break
you need to apologize
what are you going to do make out with me
lance runs and grabs kellys backpack
why are you fucking with me
you little fucker
want to play fuckface
you just used fuck as a verb noun and adjective
kelly tries to start walking again but lance has hold of him
lets see what beetle baileys got in his knapsack
lance grabs kellys arm and yanks it back
kelly still seems unconcerned
suddenly he pulls away but lance keeps hold of his backpack
lance holds the backpack up next to his head and points at it gleeful
lance walks away towards his car
kelly runs after him
lance holds kelly off easily with one hand and throws the backpack into his suv
they struggle for a minute until lance pushes kelly away gets in the car
kelly runs next to the car and pounds on the window as lance drives off
finally kelly gives up
lance turns out of the parking lot and honks the horn
kelly shakes his head
kelly sifts through a pile of backpacks looking for a replacement
from his post behind the counter bart sees him and comes over
you work here
just a couple days a month to get a heads up on the latest stuff
what are you doing
looking for a backpack
is that all
i have a couple extras at home
i could give you one if you want
beat sure i guess
kelly stands a bit awkwardly waiting for bart to get the key from the desk to open the door in the corner
the door finally swings open
bart and kelly stand between shelves piled high with war memorabilia
uniforms in vacu pac sealed bags weapons in shoeboxes cannonballs and tattered and gunsmoke darkened flags
my dads real into hoarding
kelly holds up a flask in a leather case
grants field flask
your dad should meet my history teacher
he sent me to the principals office today for questioning his g rated interpretation of the civil war
i would but now the principals making me give a speech on the civil war at an assembly
laughing in sympathy and amusement what is he some kind of sadist
she thinks shes doing me a favor
jesus she must think youre really screwed up
depends on who you ask
everyones got an opinion
grabs box take this
thatll shut them up
bart opens the long box
nestled inside is a leg bone with a foot attached to it
can you imagine that
losing your leg and getting back up on your horse
that is balls
hes got so much crap crammed in here he doesnt even notice when its missing
i saw a backpack in here somewhere
bart puts down the box carelessly and paws through the piles
bart and kelly sit at the kitchen table drinking sodas waiting for minnie the housekeeper to finish making them dinner
i thought he had a couple
id feel weird taking one out of the tomb of tutenkamen anyway
trust me you shouldnt
burps whered your old one go
i lost it
kelly decides to tell him
someone took it
you let someone take it
i didnt let him
i told off some idiot sounds like your mouth gets you into trouble a lot
im telling you its not me its the world
tabby barts older sister comes in
definitely in college if not out
and totally shockingly beautiful
tabby this is kelly
to kelly dont give him any money whatever you do
all these little old ladies are looking for him in arizona
he took their retirement money and bought defective bazookas with it
and looks at tabby more closely
were paying attention to you are you happy now
finally my life is complete
to tabby minnies making sloppy joes
she opens the fridge and gets a yogurt
i have to go take a shower
will you call me when miner gets here
bart rolls his eyes indicating what he thinks of good old miner
kelly nods doesnt say anything
listen im going to the flea market on saturday
i have a line on a couple dealers
you could get a backpack there
kelly glances at the door tabby left from
flea market land of bargains
especially if you know who to talk to
kelly looks at bart with suspicion and respect
kelly hops out of his jeep and walks towards the front of the school
lance is there hanging out with bridget and some of his cro magnon friends
he wears a ww ii cap overseas airborne style obviously kellys
like my new hat
i just joined the boy scouts
the cro magnons grunt approvingly at this witty repartee
if you stay in it long enough maybe youll get your fudgepacker badge
the cro magnons laugh at lance and egg him on you gonna take that
he just called you a fag etc
lance frowns and grabs kelly
youre a regular howie mandel
still holding on to him with one arm he slaps kelly hard across the face with the other
kellys knees give a bit
lance holds him up
lance looks over at her and releases kelly
to kelly one day you and me will be alone
and wont that be nice
kelly is hurt but covering
too bad my mom wont let me date yet
kelly frowns and adjusts his clothes
tries to re wet the dry inside of his mouth with his tongue
he turns slowly and trudges up the stairs
sarah has been watching the whole thing from the door
why do you mess with him
i should give him a break
kelly watches tv in the living room
his cheek has a nice bruise on it
oh kelly youre home
i need you to go to the art supply store for me
kelly looks at the tv
get abe to do it
eve goes to her purse and rifles through it to find her wallet
he was going to but he had to go lead a meeting at care house
what a surprise
ill make it up to you
where have i heard that before
when are you going to give me a break
kelly jabs at the remote
let me think maybe when i finally forget every single word of the little mermaid soundtrack id listen to in the car waiting for him to score
no probably when i dont prepare myself before i go into the bathroom expecting to find him passed out on the floor
eve waits through this
actually you know what
i know ill be able to put it all behind me when i go away to college
slaps his forehead pretend remembering only i cant go because someone spent my college fund on mexican black tar
so looks like ill have to try to forget at shop rite where ill be working for the rest of my life
you have every reason to crawl into the corner and give up
but please just get me some paints first
eve comes over to kelly
he sighs and puts his hand out
what do you need
she gives him the money
we need burnt sienna cadmium red and midnight blue
two tubes of blue
looks at him what happened to your face
she puts her hand up but he moves away from it
kelly looks through the paints picking out tubes
he looks up and sees tabby browsing the paintbrushes
hes suddenly nervous
he knocks over a few cans of thinner
instead he gathers his courage goes to the display opposite hers and waits to catch her eye
theyre having a sale on glitter
it takes tabby a second to recognize him
what happened to you
shrugs tennis injury
tabby looks at him suspiciously like shes not sure whether to believe him
tabby finishes with the mediums and moves onto the paints
kelly follows her staying in the opposite aisle
well you see
thats a difficult question
i dont really feel comfortable calling anything done since the renaissance painting
we might have a more experimental interaction with the picture plane but our skills have suffered from it
in spite of herself tabby laughs at this
this gives kelly more confidence
he leans over the aisle to see what shes looking at
youre working with acrylic
oils much richer
oh youre not one of those oil snobs are you
of course not
kelly comes around and leans nonchalantly against the shelves knocks more things over and fumbles to replace them
its just isnt acrylic a bit jejune
how old are you anyway
older than my years
tabby walks to the counter with her brushes
and you paint
kelly looks down and partially confesses
well you know my mothers kind of an artist so that explains it
tabby signs the slip and takes the bag
she walks out kelly with her matches her pace talking
that explains nothing
doesnt anyone believe in innate knowledge anymore
michelangelo was fifteen when he painted the infanta
infantas are spanish
michelangelo was italian
tabby gets into her car
kelly leans into her window
one world one people
just like jesse jackson envisioned
tabby tries to conceal her smile and starts her car
nice talking to you
she drives away
kelly stands there watching
then he winces
what the hell did you just say
kelly pulls up in his jeep
he turns off the engine but doesnt get out
just sits there
he doesnt want to go in
colored plastic flags droop in the sun
bart sweeps his eye over everything
a skinny guy wearing a wife beater has some not half bad stuff
kelly bruise faded to yellow and green examines a glass mason jar of what seems to be dirt
to kelly that theres actual sand from iwo jima
or your sisters sandbox
the guy shrugs
well it dont come with no certificate of authenticity
considers i could write one up for you i suppose
get it notarized
no thats quite all right
actually im in the market for medals
i got a couple purple hearts
a silver star
cant sell them to you though
they were gramps
wink bart acts casual hands clasped behind his back
are you sure
they have a lot of sentimental value yeah
bart pulls out a paper bag and offers it to the skinny guy who looks inside
general ulysses s
grants field flask my friend
kelly is shocked
the skinny guy looks at his suspiciously
throw in one of those backpacks and well call it even
the skinny guy looks at bart and in the bag again
he goes to get the backpack
kellys impressed by this smooth exchange
kelly and bart weave through the maze of stands
kelly now holds the backpack
buying and selling us service medals is illegal
thats why the resale value is so high
is that what they teach you at langely
dont be so naive
we all have our skeletons
some of them just pay more than others
and im not even going to ask about the flask
dont ask dont tell
the army gets everything right dont they
a frowsy woman in a muumuu sits fanning herself in front of an extensive display of pins and buttons
you boys look like goldwater fans
ive never been accused of that before
well jeez you dont have to be insulted
the woman considers this her fan working back and forth lazily
fish around in that cigar box
bart paws through the box
what do you want for the box
dont be so hasty
fanning i got a few geraldine ferraro pins im looking to unload
kelly and bart now wearing the smiling black white face of geraldine ferraro eat disgusting yet delicious flea market food and watch a slow motion bingo game
i think thats some kind of insult
not at dartmouth
where are you going to go to school
ah you have that luxury
shrugs i didnt have much say in the matter
everything has been decided for me since birth
im not whining about it
play the hand youre dealt right
easy for you to say
you got a royal flush
are you crazy
my life sucks
everyones always telling me what to do
you cant fight it
go with the flow
they eat for a minute to the soothing sounds of the bingo what about tabby
she got to go where she wanted
shes almost done with grad school
i didnt think people actually went to yale
thinking i dont know
i mean she drives off in her car in september
for all we know she could just pull her car over in albany and sleep there until may
what do you mean
it was a joke
bart does some fake sign language to help kelly out
is that what one of those sounds like
somehow i always imagined they would be funnier
bart pushes kelly who grabs his arm like it got hurt
isnt that for lesbians
what happened to your face
remember the backpack incident
the one with mad cow diseased hamburger meat for brains
that would be the one
interested bart leans forward
what are you going to do about it
im not going to lower myself to his level
of course not
but there are alternatives
havent you ever heard of the rd special operations wing
kelly shakes his head
well do you want to get this guy or what
lets get the fuck out of here then
bart tosses his wrapper at the trashcan
kelly watches it hit the rim and go in
on the move i have some things to show you
bart and kelly sit amidst a spread of books papers and electronic equipment
once weve gathered the intelligence the plan will reveal itself
we dont plan first
bart opens a pad
no it limits our scope whats the objective
nams probably our go to war for that sort of thing
i have the declassified briefs from the phoenix project around here somewhere
bart grabs a book and starts flipping through pages
tabby enters with an armful of art supplies
i have some stretcher bars out in the car
can somebody help me bring them in
of course well drop what were doing because what youre doing must be more important
bart doesnt look up
he grabs another book
i mean ill help
bart raises his eyebrow
kelly shrugs off the look
ill find those reports
tabby drops the canvas and points at the table
kelly dumps the bars and stands there looking around
at the wood floors and skylights
couch covered with a sheet
painting serious ones with layers of paint and mysterious objects stuck to them lay against the walls
they all seem faded like a vacation photo thats been through the wash
kelly moves to the painting on the easel
very yellow and pink
kind of looks like castles
the color of the sun
tabby wrestles with the bolt of canvas
thats the cleveland waterfront
as the viewer i get to decide what it is im afraid
and it doesnt look a thing like it
its the light
i was playing with diffusion
well make sure you put it away when youre done with it
very funny wiseass
kelly resumes his tour of the room
it must be nice to have a place like this to get away to
what about farmer
tabby unrolls the canvas and measures lengths
what about him
is he an artist too
kelly is silent for a while fiddling with a clamp light
you said your mom was a painter
she was well is i guess
tabby cuts the canvas
what do you mean
she used to be
but then my dad wasnt working anymore so she turned it into a business
she has a family of chinese immigrants in the garage making them for her
like andy warhols factory
more like andy warhols tool shed
it was nice before though
my playpen used to be in her studio
so you really grew up with it
what does did your dad do
hes a vh documentary without the music
and then things took a turn for the worse
well just wait
those burnout types always have a triumphant comeback tour
i already changed the channel
tabby sits back on her heels and looks at him
barts head appears in the open door
christ kelly i let you go out on a little supply line assist and youre gone for days
have fun boys
if only it were fun
wars deadly serious maam
to bart and i used to think you were the only crazy one
enough with the mind pollution hanoi hannah
kelly stands by the door
this is his only chance
im worried about you playing with diffusion unsupervised
i might have to come by and show you the proper safety procedures
some time in the presence of an art prodigy would do you good
i dont think i have room for a playpen in here
bart and kelly walk across the yard
so you have a thing for my sister
they skirt around the pool
we just have a few things in common
oh really like what
i cant tell you
its my feminine side
you dont wear womens clothes when youre alone do you
kelly comes out of the kitchen with a glass of water in pajama bottoms and a t shirt
the tvs on static
he sees a figure sleeping on the couch and starts to walk through the room
then he stops sighs and backtracks
he turns off the tv
then he sees the empty bottle of wine next to the couch
the figure doesnt move
kelly doesnt know what to do
kelly looks around worried
in this house an unresponsive dad isnt necessarily sleeping
should he wake up his mom
he shakes the figure slightly
it rolls over only its not his dad
its some scabby addict
kelly yanks his hand away
abe sits on a lawn chair
kelly comes out unfolds another chair and sits next to his dad a good distance away
they both look up at the sky
theres a meteor shower
a funny thing just happened
a little trip down memory lane
i thought you were on our couch dead
oh you mean emmett
they didnt have an empty bed for him at care house
kelly nods considering this
well thats one of your more brilliant ideas
anger rising have you thought about the fact that it might be dangerous
that he might steal something or go into cardiac arrest
drink all our cooking wine
which he seems to have done
he just needs a place to sleep for the night
besides having him here makes it feel like home
abe slams his hands down on the arms of his chair
ive been straight for four years almost five
a third of your life
kelly claps slowly
ive been straight the whole time
abe closes his eyes
i hate to tell you this but im not your problem anymore
kelly gets up
thats the one thing i get to decide
abe looks at kelly
let me know
i can wait
they look at each other
kelly shakes his head and goes inside
abe looks up at the sky
to himself keller theres a meteor shower
in a backyard tree house next door sit kelly and bart kelly looking through a pair of m field glasses
i have the target in sight
through the twin circles lance gets into his car in front of his house
i think hes leaving
let me see
dont be a farb give them up
kelly hands the glasses over
bart looks through them
then he puts them down
the coast is clear
the boys looks at each other
let me prepare to deploy
bart opens up a duffel bag and pulls out a yellow jumpsuit which he puts on
kelly looks through the binoculars
is this going to work
weve planned for every contingency using the tried and true techniques of the last great world power
save it for the press conference
the boys climb down out of the tree house
bart is dressed in an official looking yellow jumpsuit with telephone repairmens tool hanging from his belt and a hard hat on
kelly carries a toolbox
on my signal
he looks at kelly
then he holds up one finger and gestures go
they sneak hunched over towards the fence
a little girl comes out of the house and stops when she sees them
bart and kelly look at each other
bart takes the toolbox and gestures to kelly by pointing at the girl and covering his mouth
kelly peels off towards the girl while bart continues across the lawn
the girl starts to scream
kelly swoops up and covers her mouth with his hand
he tucks her under his arm and runs towards the opposite side of the house
he puts the girl down still covering her mouth
were the good guys
if you scream the bad guys are going to come and burn down your house
so stay here and be quiet
the girl nods
kelly takes his hand off her mouth and starts to sneak away
my dad has a gun
kelly runs across the street to get a view of the front door
bart turns up the driveway and rings the doorbell
lances mother opens the door
bart confers with her briefly and steps inside
the door closes behind him
kelly stares so hard at the door he doesnt see the neighbor come up behind him
can i help you young man
kelly starts and turns
i was just inspecting your lawn
kelly grabs a few blades of grass
have you thought about astroturf
it takes a lot less water to keep green
i mean no water technically
im not interested
kelly gets up and starts to walk down the street only lance pulls up in his suv
kelly darts behind a parked car and watches lance go into the house
lance comes right back out
he forgot something in his car
kelly moves around the car trying to keep it between him and lance
bart comes down the front walk whistling and eating a cookie
he smiles at lance now coming back up the walk
smile worker bee
ill be your boss some day
bart nods and tips his hard hat
kelly follows him on the other side of the row of cars until lances house is out of sight
then he gets in step beside bart
what an asshole
his mom gave me cookies though
did you get it done
dont ask stupid questions
lets go home and listen
the boys sit around an fm receiver recorder
it was a five watt fm bug so we should be in range bart flips the on switch and lances moms voice fills the room
the boys smile with delight
so then i told her harriet with potato salad like that its no wonder ray rays cheating on you
but i was thinking it
instead i just told her to add more vinegar next time and kelly shakes his head as the women natter away
i dont think we can use any of this
its voice activated so well get everything
its going to be great
all right then
kelly gets up to leave while bart fiddles with the knobs
we reconnoiter tomorrow at nineteen hundred hours
abe and eve have dinner together
and if we dont sell them there well set up on the corner of stevens and lane by the gas station
thats a good location
eve looks at her husband and sees hes not paying attention
he seems a little out of it
hes pushing his food around on his plate
are you listening to me
did you make this with more chili pepper than usual
the same as always
kelly comes in walks through the kitchen and up the stairs
his parents eat for a minute in silence
abe winces and puts down his fork
eve smiles tenderly at him
one day were all going to be happy
abe puts his hand over hers
that sounds nice
bart moves around the room excitedly
its really too perfect actually
i cant describe
just hit play
its all cued up
kelly hits a button
the tape clicks on
from the speakers comes recorded i told you that makes me nervous
me no likey
but baby my birthdays coming up
thats not a good enough reason
a little action
a little prime time action
but people might see us
thats the point
thats what makes it sexxxy
kelly stops the tape
bart and kelly share a look
lets draw up the plans
i have a few notes jotted down
all we have to do is fill in the details and let operation deadmeat begin
bridget primps at her locker while kelly watches nervously from his
when she starts to close the locker door kelly rushes towards her and bumps into her
her books and papers spill to the floor
oh jesus im so sorry he starts picking them up
oh its okay she looks around
if lance showed up it wouldnt be good for either of them
kelly hands her the rest of her stuff
they part ways
kelly shoves a piece of paper into his pocket
principal holmstead clicks down the hall in her heels and kelly ducks into a doorway just in time
he turns and pretends to look at a posted announcement as she passes
bart inspects bridgets book report with a jewelers loop
he swings over to a piece of stationary kellys working on
she dots her is with hearts
and her ls are loopier
the l is very important
im working on it
they both crouch over the paper
i feel kind of bad for her
shes a nice girl
sometimes collateral damage cant be avoided
he pushes back from the table
how does that look
inspecting pretty good
i think were ready to manufacture a document
kelly takes out a fresh sheet of paper
clears his throat begin
its your birthday and youve been a very bad boy
but so has the baby
both baby and daddy have to get punished only this time lance shirtless reads aloud from the letter
baby makes the rules
await further instructions at school tomorrow bart wears his school uniform and sits in the passenger seat next to kelly
contd baby will be waiting where daddy least expects her
do you have everything
kelly just looks at him
barts already asked this question
we cant afford any errors
you dont need to tell me
its my ass on the line
kelly pulls up in front of barts school
bart turns to him and puts a hand on his shoulder
i wish i could be there to see it
youll get the de brief
its a day that will live in infamy
you couldnt do any better than that
i dont hear you coming up with anything
bart hops out and salutes kelly who give him the thumbs up in response and pulls away
lance cant keep his hands off bridget
whats gotten into you
nothing you bad girl
did you drink a bottle of robitussin before school again
the bell rings
see you soon my naughty baby
bridget looks a little scared
lance slouches into a seat next to kelly who drops another stationary note into lances open backpack
kelly watches as lance grabs his book sees the note opens it and leers
its my birthday
im going to get a present
kelly looks down at his desk and smiles
damn it fuckface
whatre you smiling about
you wish you were me
lance raises his hand
may i be excused
lance leaves like a house afire
to himself eine maus findet den kase
lance sneaks down the hall towards the storage closet and whispers into the door
daddys here for the easter egg hunt
he pulls open the door
lance turns on the light
no one there
but propped up on the shelf next to a vase with a rose in it is another note
ooh push my buttons
he snatches the note
his eyes widen as he reads
you little minx
bart crouches in the stall looking at his watch
when the second hand sweeps past the twelve he opens his cell phone and punches in a number
serious grownup voice yes i need to get a message to bridget shumann
this is mensa
kids mill around
at one end of the cafeteria gym is a small stage the kind pep rallies are held on
lance edges his way through the crowd making a beeline for the stage door
a confused bridget stands at the secretarys desk
but i just got this note last period
well i dont have anything here for you let me look again
oh yes the mensa called
the secretary hands bridget the message
she looks at it
they want me to be an honorary member
pause is that like a sorority or something
lance looks around eagerly
he peeks through the curtains at all the kids and can barely contain his excitement
come on daddys sick
he needs his medicine
he spots a woman in the shadows
it must be bridget
he unbuckles his pants and lets them drop to him knees
i brought our friend along
hes happy to see you
he rips off his shirt and shuffles across the dark stage toward her
kelly looks at his watch
bart looks at his watch in anticipation
kelly flicks a switch and presses a button
the crowd falls silent and turns towards the mechanical sound of the stage curtain opening
they squint from the bright stage lights
shock ripples through the crowd as they take in the tableau revealed to them a frozen half naked lance on his knees before a blow up doll tied to a
what the fuck are you all looking at
bridget standing in the doorway covers her mouth in horror
look hes got a hard on
lance stumbles off stage to hoots and catcalls but mostly hysterical laughter
kelly smiles laughs and claps his hands with delight
then he returns to military precision
he turns all the switches back to how they were and uses his shirtsleeve to cover the doorknob so as not to leave fingerprints
bart pours them two glasses of his dads scotch
youre kidding me
there it was
the whole school saw it
wasnt too impressive either
they raise their glasses to each other
to operation mincemeat
to the rd
they both take swallows of scotch
how does it feel to give better than you get
kelly finishes his scotch
you want some more
croaking dont mind if i do
thats my boy
the drink again
kellys feet are up
for the first time he looks comfortable
sarah stands at her register flipping through a magazine
kelly pulls up on the electro shopper with field goggles on
you know what this is
he puts his foot down like a kickstand
eighteen volts of pure freedom
oh it is
unless you know how to handle it
kelly runs his hand lovingly along the frame
then he looks up at sarah
you ever seen the freshly waxed floor in the produce section glistening under full florescence
sarah gets on behind him
hold on tight
he puts his foot up and kicks it into gear
the electro shopper takes off barely
kelly takes the corner too sharp and clips the edge of an end cap display of cereal boxes they fall to the floor
the electro shopper inches forward
have you been drinking
kelly looks in at his parents checking to make sure theyre still asleep
when he leaves abe opens his eyes and listens to the door close downstairs
kelly throws some paints and brushes into his backpack
kelly stands awkwardly on the front stoop with his backpack
minnie opens the door
barts not here he oh thats all right
actually im here to see tabby
just to do a little painting with her
shes out back in her studio
tabby stands barefoot in the sunlight a palette knife in her hand
she looks over as the door opens surprised
i warned you id come
she goes back to painting
kelly stands there for a minute waiting for her to say something else give him an invitation
until she looks up and sees him standing in the same place
maybe i should go well youre here now
set your canvas up
use one of the ones in the corner
kelly looks through them and picks one
brushes are in the jar
paints in the drawer
i brought my own
he takes off his backpack and opens it
kelly busies himself pulling out paints and other supplies
he cant help but look at her
the light hits her hair and she glows
she catches him looking
does it mess up your concentration
me being here
she turns back to her painting
kelly sets up his canvas
just dont talk
why would i
pause im kidding
i like that
kelly feels the tubes of paint
squirts some color out
looks over his shoulder at her
hes trying to get his act together to be cool about being there in the studio alone with her
trying to figure out how to play it
miner opens the door
smiles like the stockbroker he is and crosses to him
miner holds out his hand for a good old fashioned shake
kelly takes it
miner looks confused
this is kelly kelly ernswiler
i quite all right
smiles as an afterthought so what do we have here a little painting class
kellys a friend of barts
whats your real job
kelly smiles eagerly at miner over the edge of his canvas
that would be stock boy at the shop rite
but as president don kaminsky says every employee is part owner
so you could say im a captain of industry in training
kind of capitalist larva
thats quite an image
only if you see the most magical part
do you see
kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little
one day ill be a beautiful butterfly
first ill have to be a pupa though
i figure i wont be going out much then
pupa the awkward adolescence of the insect world
miner stares at kelly
he cant tell what he might be making fun of or if it might be him
whatever it takes to get you through the day
kelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response though miner doesnt see it
he grabs tabbys paintbrush and pulls her to him
i have the afternoon off
come away with me
im not at a good stopping point
oh come on
theyll still be here
to kelly i know youll still be here
kelly smiles his most idiotic energetic smile and slaps paint on his canvas in exaggerated strokes
i really shouldnt
but everyone will be coming soon
and it will get all crazy and we wont have any time to ourselves
tabby kisses miner
he realizes theres no convincing her and sighs
we can practice honeymoon suite
miner looks at kelly who looks away
then he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves
tabby and kelly paint in silence for a while
kelly moves around to look at his canvas from different angles like hes copying what he thinks a painter would do
is he always like that
tabby stops and puts down her brush
just because he didnt want to picture you as a pupa
oh he will later
when hes alone
whether he wants to or not
not that though
how he wanted you to stop
he wants to be with me
whats so bad about that
just because some one wants to be with you doesnt mean theyre good for you
kelly is suddenly very involved with his painting
he has a hard time making eye contact with tabby
no one should ever ask you to stop
if you stop you might not be able to start again
or you might start again only things will be different
well thats sweet its not sweet actually
its just the truth
hey i can take care of myself
she picks up her brush
whens the wedding
at the end of the month
but dont ask me about it
it makes me nervous
kelly looks at her seriously
is something wrong
what are you painting
kelly stops and sighs now back in serious artist mode
really there are so many layers of imagistic symbolism that i really dont feel comfortable summing it up but well its a recurring dream image
a mermaid riding a rocket ship
tabby stops painting
what do you mean how
shes riding it sidesaddle
shes got a fish tail for chrissake
i havent decided yet if shes got scuba gear on or not
do you have any idea what youre talking about
kelly puts up his thumb in an approximation of an artists gesture
does that matter
well some people actually say what they really think
what if they dont know what they really think
it doesnt matter
its called being yourself
scary and wonderful and exciting
kelly stops squeezing paint onto his palette
his gestures slow down
hes taking this in
then he shakes it off
im trying to create here
stop distracting me
kelly comes in to return the art supplies
xiou xious alone working
she looks up and smiles at kelly
moms got you working late
kelly walks over and sees what shes working on
a beautiful spare chinese landscape
youre really good
why do you make those stupid animals for mom
each painting is a lesson
here she gets out a piece of paper for him
im making a lot of art these days
i guess that means a lot of lessons
each line has a whole drawing contained in it
each drawing has a whole life contained in it
oh thats all
kelly watches her for a minute the delicate whoop and swirl of her strokes
he dips a brush into the ink and watches xiou xious restrained and confident movements
eve leans against the doorframe
hey you two
ill try not to act surprised
it might spoil the moment
kelly puts down the paintbrush
i cant do this
i have to go
keller i think im missing some art supplies
have you seen them around the house
kelly avoids her eyes as he leaves
no i havent
i dont know what to do with him
you son is not yet cooked
give him time
eve looks over xiou xious shoulder
when are you going to let me give you your own show
we could do it for real
when you offer me an eighty twenty split
kelly eats with the bowlands barts mom mathilda his dad harrison and tabby and bart
the bowlands dress up a bit for dinner like any good wasp family
to harrison but i told you i want to take german germans a cold war language
you cant get any kind of state department position without more diverse linguistic training than that
youll take chinese
are we on the same page
mutters same page
everyone eats in silence
to tabby so darling when are you going to bite the bullet and do the seating arrangement
tabby puts down her fork
i cant deal with that stuff ma
i dont care who sits next to whom
i should have eloped
after all mrs
bowland sometimes when you bite the bullet it explodes in your mouth
mathilda looks surprised
this could go either way
tentatively why ive never thought about it before but that is a rather strange expression isnt it
you wouldnt say sooner or later youve got to put the grenade in your pants would you
but have you ever noticed how in movies they always bite the grenade before they throw it
yeah but they never take a bite out of their pants
everyone but bart laughs
tabby throws kelly a grateful glance for getting her out of a conversation she didnt want to have
what an unusual conversation
do you have similar discussions at the dinner table with your family kelly
i ask why all the furniture is missing and my dad reminisces about dropping acid and watching neil armstrong walk on the moon
all but bart laughs again
he talks about art
kelly looks down at his plate
my mothers kind of an artist so you come from a creative family do you
mathilda salts her food
i wish my boys would talk to me about my passions
i cant get them anywhere near the subject of my garden
i noticed your magnolias
very fine specimens
they are fine arent they
ironic is there nothing you cant discuss
if anyone notices the slight edge to barts voice they ignore it
here kelly try a bit of these leeks
minnie has a way with the white sauce
kelly and bart play playstation ii medal of honor in barts bedroom
bart is sulking almost imperceptibly
my dad has this friend whos a director
hes shooting a documentary for the history channel
he needs some guys to do a reenactment of some european theater battles for him
kelly stops playing and looks at bart
were going to be on the history channel
barts eyes stay on the screen
i havent asked you yet
oh come on
kelly jabs at his controller
well if you want to
but you have to take it seriously
kelly gives bart a derisive glance
what do you mean
of course i will
the flickering tv light illuminates barts pinched look
from what ive seen you play fast and loose with your characterizations
this has got to be straight up
this annoys kelly
im not fast and loose
i play the emotional truth
i make it real
bart glances at him
like back in the dining room
what does that have to do with it
bart shakes his head
mimics i noticed your magnolias
very fine specimens
that was real
kellys video game character dies
he drops the controller
what is this about
shrugs you just seem to have your own agenda thats all
bart plays on
hes keeping a lid on everything while kelly gets more and more agitated
my own agenda
what other reason is there to do anything
im just saying
i know the difference between fantasy and reality
kelly looks at bart in disbelief
are you saying i dont
bart wont meet his eyes
i dont know
bart pauses the game
why didnt you tell me your dad was a burn out
kelly gets up and grabs his jacket
why do you steal from yours
bart un pauses the game and continues playing
kelly drinks from the fountain and wipes his mouth on his sleeve
principal holmsteads smiling face greets him when he straightens up
i told some of your teachers about your presentation
were all really looking forward to it
kelly frowns at the principals back as she clicks away
they walk down the hall together
i dont want to talk about it
as a matter of fact do me a favor and pretend you never heard anything about it
i kelly starts to pull ahead
i have an extra ticket to aerosmith this weekend
aw sarah thats really great i mean
its just that im busy
yeah i figured
ill see you in the dairy section though
she stands there looking lost
kelly smoothes the cover over his jeep
bart pulls up to the curb in his bmw
what are you doing here
i tracked you down
theres someone id like you to meet
a few old soldiers sit sunning in chairs in the industrial feeling living room
bart and kelly sit across from charlie hayes an old black guy playing dominos
to kelly are you one too
and what do you see in that
living dying camaraderie bravery the big stuff
things we dont have anymore
charlie sorts his tiles and scowls
he leans in to kellys face giving him the eye
and do you think its brave getting trench foot and syphilis eating another ration of spoiled frank and beans out of a dented can
kelly is taken aback by this
well no charlie leans back and nods thinking about kellys response
he no longer seems angry
yeah that wouldnt be much fun would it
charlie sets down a tile and pulls at his chin
parts of it were kind of fun though
i got separated from my platoon and lived for two weeks in the forest of the ardennes living off what i could kill
pause i felt very close to the land
bart gives kelly a significant look
kelly doesnt notice
hes looking closely at charlie
kelly sits in the car
bart pumps gas
they talk through the window
i met him when my mom made me go around caroling with the youth group
you dont really believe that stuff about berlin
and hitlers compound
does it matter
of course it matters
doesnt the truth matter
i dont know
you tell me
kelly avoids this by getting out of the car
i want a drink
let me borrow a couple bucks
i told you not to play him for money
i was trying to be nice
hes your friend
bart returns the pump and screws in the gas cap
you should know better
what do you want
mountain dew just then he glances towards the gas station and sees eve set up in the adjacent abandoned lot
shes got the van parked there with the sliding door open and paintings propped around on display
but eve has seen him
she shields her eyes with her hand and calls to him
kelly backtracks towards the car
that womans calling you
eve walks over to them
kelly cant get out of it
meet my mom
eve smiles brightly
what a nice surprise
its so nice to finally meet you
bart is surprised but recovers his manners quickly just like hes been taught to
so doing a little business
a little is right
but i work it as much as i can
kelly shifts his weight from foot to foot
eve looks at both of them
so what have you boys been up to
bart took me to meet his friend charlie at the old soldiers home
charlie at the old soldiers home
you dont know him
you boys should swing by care house
there are some vets there
eve watches a car pull into the lot next to the van
i should go
but you boys should come over to our house some time
to bart i know your family must get tired of him
kelly visibly bristles at the thought of his parents entertaining bart
not at all
but id love to anyway
eve looks at kelly
then she runs back over to the van
there you go
now you know everything
whats your problem
shes pretty cute
kelly rolls his eyes and gets back in the car
dont you want your soda
kelly watches bart pick through parts of his uniform
after the encounter with mom hes retreated into himself
so filmings on saturday
can you make it
are you kidding
its gonna be really cool
hes got an explosives expert coming
kelly doesnt say anything
kelly runs his hand through his hair
he cant bring himself to say whats really on his mind
remember that stupid speech
kelly picks up barts colt and sights with it
he knows kellys avoiding the real stuff
im supposed to give it next week
bart polishes his combat boots
maybe you should talk to my dad about it
you think hed go for that
bart keeps his head down polishes intently
he loves you
he was talking the other day about helping you out
ironic want to go to dartmouth
are you serious
if you applied for spring semester he could pull some strings
shakes his head slowly i dont think that would work for me
considering my background
yeah probably not
im not properly socialized
i wouldnt fit in
bart checks his bandoleer and cartridges
no its not
tell that to my family
theyre like your fucking fan club
bart pauses darts his eyes at kelly
even tabby likes you
so much she ratted me out to you
well shes inviting you to the wedding
bart watches kellys face
but you probably wont enjoy that much will you
i dont know what youre talking about
i love weddings
i always get drunk and make out with someones cousin
bart throws his olive drab socks at kellys head
good ill call moms nephew fletcher and tell him to expect a little action
let me give some advice
hes very into sharks at the moment
kelly waves to minnie and goes out the front door
there he pauses trying to decide what to do
then he scowls
he goes around the corner
towards tabbys studio
tabby sits on the couch facing away from the door
why did you tell tabby turns toward him
oh im sorry
he knows he should leave but kelly just stands there
kelly runs his hand along his pants in a nervous gesture
tabby dabs at her face
miner and i broke up
i didnt think you two were right for each other
you did huh
kelly walks over to her painting
like this painting
stare at it too long and you cant see it anymore
but if someone else sees it for the first time they can tell exactly what it is
i dont need any more bullshit right now
kelly stops taken aback
he walks away from the painting
he could never understand you
im not as complicated as you think
kelly walks to the window and looks out
i never said you were complicated
tabby laughs cries at this
he just wasnt the right one
shes starting to calm down a little
theres more to it than that
tabby looks at her shredded tissue
kelly sits down on the couch next to her
im really sorry
i really am
kelly pats her knee awkwardly
tabby turns her face to kellys
you like me dont you
tabby closes her eyes
no i mean you like me
kelly looks scared
he wants to retreat
but he calms himself down
i think youre amazing
well do something
then kelly kisses her
she kisses back and they fall against the couch together
all right all right
bart comes out in his pajamas to turn off the sprinkler
he looks up and freezes
kelly comes out of tabbys studio
he shuts the door carefully and walks around the pool
kelly doesnt see bart
bart doesnt say anything
he just watches kelly go
kelly throws parts of his soldiers kit onto his bed from corners of the room
the canteen underhand
the jeep cap as a free throw
this is the best day of his life
until he finds his uniform crumpled up behind the door still crusted with mud
he flops on his bed
but he cant help it
soon hes smiling again
he gets up gathers up the uniform and tears out of the room
kelly comes down the stairs two at a time singing
eve and abe watch surprised from the table
abe looks pale
bart sits in his desk chair frowning
mathilda knocks and opens the door
minnies starting dinner
is kelly coming over
not tonight ma
mathilda pauses and looks at her son
an assistant director and cameraman unload equipment from a van
the director looks off into the distance trying to visualize
kelly pulls up next to the van
he wears a spotlessly clean uniform
are you with the st or the nd
well nd today
its not my usual division
technically my patches indicate whatever
make yourself comfortable
well be a while setting up
some of the other boys are over by craft service
kelly doesnt go anywhere
the snack table
its over there
someone will come get you when were ready
is bart bowland here yet
oh harrisons son
i dont know
kelly and a half dozen other soldiers stand or sit in the grass around the table
they talk and rest on their backpacks
a makeup artist makes the rounds
to kelly and you are
kelly ernswiler private first class
all right kelly
lets take a look at you
she gets out some pomade and runs a comb through his hair slicking it back
thats it handsome
when she walks away he messes up his hair again
he scans the crowd
were going to start positioning
then well go through a few rehearsals
points at soldiers you you and you go over there by that tree
you and you guys behind the hill
looks at clipboard okay whos got the jeep
wed like to use it
can you drive it beyond the hill over there
kelly tries to act casual
i dont think that would be a problem
he walks towards his jeep and pauses
have you seen bart bowland
has he checked in
weve got enough people
it doesnt matter
kelly nods wondering a bit
but its soon forgotten
to jeep hot lips old girl youre going to be famous
yells okay people
listen to my voice
from now on you do whatever this voice says
take your place
kelly waits with his rifle next to his jeep bored
he sees a figure in the shadows of the trees
he raises his rifle and points it at the figure
bart steps out of the barn
where the hell have you been
they put you over here with me
i think well get some close ups
they want me to drive old lippy
isnt that awesome
bart doesnt say anything
what the hells your problem
i ought to fucking kill you
you had to do it
kelly shakes his head avoiding barts eyes trying to keep it normal
what are you talking about
you just do whatever the fuck you want
and consequences dont matter do they
are you out of your mind
bart looks at kelly
sees nothing but a kid in an old army uniform
what the fuck do you think shes going to do run off with you
the blood rises to kellys face
but he still wont look at bart
youre a seventeen year old bag boy
shes a yale grad student
talk about living in a fucking fantasy world
kellys hands turn white around the rifle
youd rather have me be miserable like you are
bart comes closer
biting sarcasm once again youve displayed your uncanny ability to nail the truth of a character
kelly finally raises his head
and looks bart right in the eyes
stop talking out your dads mouth and use your own for once
bart lunges at kelly
the cameras set up
the groups are in position
stands by the cameraman
standby for rehearsal
cue the explosion
in the field
soldiers leap out of trenches
cue the jeep
cue the jeep
cue the fucking jeep
shakes his head
comes around the corner followed by the cameraman
bart and kelly roll around on the ground
what the h
christ is going on over here
bart and kelly continue to fight
to cameraman hey roll this
are you getting this
the cameraman puts his camera up to his eye and films
kelly finally pushes bart off him gets in his jeep and drives away
to cameraman follow him
are you getting it
bart sits on the ground out of breath
we can use this
well cut it together
directs the camera at bart
get close on him
bart pushes the camera away
kelly lays in bed staring at the ceiling
theres a cut across his eyebrow
eve comes in carrying her car keys and sits on the bed
i dont want to talk about it
well youre going to have to
your fathers at the hospital
which one of his loser friends ended up there
eve plays with her keys
then she stops
they think he has stomach cancer
kelly feels the sensation of falling like a dream
then he snorts and rolls over away from his mom
oh this is just perfect
eve looks at the back of kellys head
shes tired but still trying to deal
why would you say something like that
because it seems to fit
seems to fit
do you understand what i just said
kelly gets up
puts his feet on the floor
his shoulders are slumped
why do you want to say it again
kelly i have to go to work
he gets up and holds the door open for her
eve looks at him heart heavy
kelly sits on the bed
then he looks at the rabbit painting
he grabs it off the wall and slams it backwards against the floor so he doesnt have to look at it
the painting falls back against the bayonet fixed to kellys rifle and tears
he kicks it
kelly angrily wrestles with giant boxes of paper towels
he rips open the box and they roll everywhere
sarah watches from checkout
she comes over to help him pick them up
i forgot to tell you this box was booby trapped
kelly doesnt say anything
the concert was lame
the opening act singer ripped his leather pants during a stupid dance routine and stormed off stage
pause looks at his cut are you okay
kelly gathers an armful of paper towels
listen im busy
i doubt it
sarah puts a couple of rolls on the shelf
um i dont have a perfect life if thats what youre asking
kelly stops what hes doing
no sarah actually im not asking
i never ask you anything but you just talk anyway
have you ever noticed that
sarah drops the rolls she had in her hands
kelly shakes his head
kelly still in his work clothes comes in without knocking
hey i hoped you were up he stops when he sees tabby and miner sleeping together on the couch
tabby opens her eyes
kelly goes and takes his painting off the easel
i just came to get this
tabby follows kelly across the yard
kelly stops and turns around
i guess the weddings back on
tabby smiles sadly
im really sorry
they stand there in the yard
tabby wraps her arms around herself
my dads got cancer
tabby looks at kelly pained
she takes a step towards him
he backs up
i guess we all get what we deserve
kelly looks at tabby for a second then turns and walks away
kelly drives along an open stretch of road
he throws the painting out of the jeep
he comes to a turn and takes it much too fast
the jeep skids teeters on two wheels and goes over the embankment
steam trails up from the jeeps radiator
the front end is completely smashed
kelly bangs his fist against the steering wheel
then he calm himself gets out and starts walking
kelly rides an old bike up to the bike rack and locks it
kelly comes in late
there you are
i was just telling the class about our special treat today
ernswiler is going to be giving the three first period history classes a little talk about the civil war
kelly closes his eyes
he had forgotten or tried to forget
lets all make our way in an orderly fashion down to the auditorium shall we
the class bolts for the door
orderly i said orderly
norman looks at kelly pleasantly
well what are we waiting for
im so looking forward to hearing your views
kelly sits in a chair on the stage next to mr
a scattering of kids sit out in the auditorium
principal holmstead stands at the podium
for those of you who havent had the chance to get to know kelly you should know he has a very interesting hobby
he takes part in reenactments of world war ii battles right here in ohio
i did that too
when i was seven
he has an unusual first hand knowledge of history
we recently discovered that this extends beyond world war ii to the civil war which he is going to discuss with you today
kelly rises to scant applause
he stands at the podium looking out at the crowd
he looks down and thinks
he looks back up
the silence stretches
kids start giggling
finally he leans into the microphone
he walks off stage
norman well go after him
on his knees kelly fumbles with his bike lock getting madder and madder
just as hes about to get it undone lance appears
what they re assign you to the bicycle brigade
kelly frowns at the lock
too bad cause im not
remember that little show i put on for the school
i dont know what youre talking about
oh come on
kelly looks up at lance
i heard about it
and did you hear me and bridget arent going out anymore because of it
i havent been following the story
yeah well lets get this over with
it is over
lance pushes kelly away from his bike
kelly falls back on his hands
he squints up at lance and moves back towards his bike
lance kicks him back with his foot and looks at him
just let me go home
did you call me a homo
lance kicks him again
kelly breathes hard
this isnt a good time for me
lets re schedule
no time like the present
lance picks kelly up and slaps him hard on the face
first you should probably get me to write home to my mother
lance punches kelly and he reels
then kelly lunges for him and they fall to the ground
kelly swings wildly but lance pins him down and gives him a few good ones
norman comes out
norman rushes over to them
kelly scrambles up and rips at his bike lock gets on his bike and rides away
norman tries to take a panting lance by the arm but lance shakes him off
get off me
kelly rides by his house and keeps going
kelly stops and looks up at the hospital but cant bring himself to go in
he pedals on
kelly sits on the loading dock of an abandoned factory
he watches the rusty barges glitter on the water
the wind ruffles his sweaty hair
kellys at the front door
barts not here
she closes the door
kelly wheels his bike down the driveway
he sees bart sitting out by the pool with a couple of langely bart sees kelly and ignores him laughs at something one of the guys says
kelly sits on the toilet putting a bandage on a red scrape down his arm
eve appears in the doorway
kelly looks up at her
hes still got the cut eyebrow which has split back open and some dried blood under his nose
let me see that
eve comes over and tilts kellys head back to look at the cut
this is the first time shes touched him
she gets some antiseptic and ointment from under the sink along with band aids and goes to work
kelly lets her dab at his face
he closes his eyes
im going over to see dad
kelly opens his eyes and pulls away
eve puts a butterfly bandage across kellys eyebrow
and you need to come
kelly pulls his head away
i dont want to
at this point thats not an option
nows not a good time ma
eve looks at kelly sadly
its never a good time
you cant make me
eve shakes her head
voice rising its not about you anymore dont you get it
it was never about me
eve rises to her feet
hes just sent her over the edge
yelling what is wrong with you
when are you going to stop blaming us blaming him
im sick of you being angry
i want to be angry
they just took out half of your fathers stomach enough
screaming and crying you will not tell me whats enough
you dont know about anything
all you do is fight fake battles in the woods on the playground
but this right here us this is the real one the only one worth anything
she stops and breaks down
the man i love is dying
thats between you and him
eve looks at her son
her face looks older
if i made a mistake if you felt left out im sorry
but i can only deal with one thing at a time
kelly sits on the toilet lost
the sun shines in through kellys window
hes laying in bed awake has been for a while
he gets up and starts dressing slowly and deliberately
he puts on his best shirt and tie sensing trouble when the ties too short
he pulls the suit out of his closet
the jacket doesnt fit
the sleeves dont even go down to his wrists
and he can hardly button the pants
he rips off the jacket
he pulls everything out of his closet
he sits on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands
he looks at his dress uniform hanging on the back of the closet in its dry cleaning bag right where his mom left it
he shakes his head
no he couldnt do that
then he sighs
its decorated for a wedding
flower garlands trail up the banisters
guests trickle in
harrison dressed in a suit with a boutonniere on his lapel talks to an usher
dont sit any of mathildas sisters next to me if you can help it
to guest oh hello
so nice to see you
thank you for coming
bart comes outside also dressed as an usher
to bart wheres the priest
he should be here any minute
bart walks down the steps and looks down the street
kellys walking towards him
in his dress uniform
bart walks down the street to meet him
what the fuck are you doing
kelly looks down
he cant meet barts eyes
i was invited
i uninvited you
its not your wedding
bart looks at kelly and shakes his head
why are you wearing that
kelly doesnt answer
softening i cant let you come in
because you know why
just go home
kelly finally looks up at bart and nods
a town car pulls up
tabby gets out in her wedding dress
has there even been a more glorious woman
will there ever be again
her maid of honor leads her around to the side of the church
kelly watches every step
she looks beautiful
tell her give her my congratulations
kelly walks off
bart watches him go
kelly sits on the edge of the bed head in hands
he sees the torn rabbit painting
after a minute he picks it up and looks at it
xiou xiou sits painting
kelly enters with the rabbit
son of eve
you startled me
can you fix this
she examines it and takes out a wet sponge
she wipes it across the back of the canvas
your mom made it for you
i can fix it
she works silently for a minute
kelly watches her
she cuts a small piece of canvas to repair the hole
did you come here to work on your own stuff
dont waste your time on this
i never waste time
she turns the painting over and gets out some paints to touch it up
everything can be mended
youre trying to tell me something arent you
i could not tell you anything
eve sleeps in a chair next to abe in bed sleeping
he looks pale but otherwise fine
kelly stands in the doorway still in his uniform
abe comes to and sees him standing there
how you feeling
they gave me some stitches downstairs
points to eyebrow three
did you get punched
a couple times actually
i know the feeling
come on in and watch some television
dont worry this ones bolted to the wall
as you can see my reputation precedes me
kelly comes into the room and sits in a chair
any battles this weekend
abe and kelly look up at the television in the corner
answer me this how come no one ever reenacts the vietnam war
itd be pretty depressing wouldnt it
i guess it would
both continue to look up at the television
plus that youd have to have protesters and stuff
folks dressed up like your mom and me
people reenacting fleeing to canada burning draft cards
i guess that would ruin the spirit of the thing now wouldnt it
i could make it work
abe looks at kelly
i bet you could
eve wakes up
kelly is that you
you were expecting some one else
kelly and eve get snacks from the vending machine
he looks good
eve looks at kelly her face full of love and sadness
he looks just like you
kelly nods slowly taking this in
and it is finally too much
he breaks down and cries
for the fear and the misplaced rage the fights and the stubbornness
but finally relief
they walk back down the hall together
eve reaches out and puts her hand on kellys neck
kelly rides his bike past the house and stops when he sees the car packed up in front
bart comes out with a box of stuff
you going away already
the have this intensive summer orientation thing
is that good
bart puts the box in the car
well its optional but dad thinks it would be a good way to meet people
hes probably right
he usually is
they stand there
well go big green
kelly gives him a little ra ra with one hand
kellys been doing his research
kelly lifts his foot up to the pedal of his bike
and get laid will ya
bart laughs a little and shakes his head
kelly is gone
harrison comes out
is that everything
everything youd let me bring
harrison checks the ties on the roof
give me a break
kelly stocks shelves
theres a new girl working the register
kelly sees sarah come in
he follows her to the bakery
sarah picks some bagels
how come you dont work here anymore
the electro shoppers getting rusty
ive got a summer internship at an ad agency
its all right i guess
no its great
kelly moves around to her other side closer
hey sarah moves away
once bitten twice shy and all that
when are you going to get a real job
i dont know
probably when i figure out something better to do
you cant be a stock boy your whole life
sarah walks to the front of the store
kelly walks with her
yeah i can
i mean i probably wont but i could
sarah turns to him at the checkout aisle
well it was good seeing you
remember that presentation i told you never to ask me about again
kelly stands in the front of the room pointing to a battle plan with large arrows drawn on it
norman principal holmstead eve and sarah sit among other old soldiers
lee arrayed his defenses over here
only this time grant was ready for him
kelly keeps talking
many of the old soldiers sleep
to old soldier this is boring
lets see that slide of the wife again
sarah kelly and eve play dominos with charlie and mr
to charlie remarkable remarkable
and they never knew
the real kicker was moving those cutouts of tanks around
the thought we had a whole regiment over there but it was just a couple of us and those hollywood props
art playing a part in war
youre damned right
we practically won the thing right there
eyeing sarah and eve with approval now this is more like it
anyone care to place a wager on the table
kelly tries to gesture to sarah no
if you think it would be more fun
i cant imagine having more fun that i am now
norman smiles at the group
youre never been to a french whorehouse i take it
eve waits while kelly and sarah walk out to sarahs car
kelly helps sarah into it and closes the door for her
i still dont understand how you did that
i spent my summers with my grandma in the catskills
she didnt give me any spending money
shrugs so i played the bones for ice cream
she pulls away
he watches her go
