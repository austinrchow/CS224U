wallace william kelley pamela wallace the faces of several young children are presented in closeup as they walk toward us across a ploughed field
on the sound track the haunting sounds of a gregorian funeral chant
the camera pans up to the faces of older brothers and sisters then to parents and grandparents
these are not familiar faces but faces from another age strong and open
all are dressed in the distinctive clothing of the amish
through the last traces of early morning mist another group of black clad figures make their way down a lane
an amish buggy black and highwheeled stark against the landscape appears a spirited chestnut in the traces
framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern figure of an amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat his bonneted wife in muted colors the
face of a boy attired like his father peering out
the horses breath smokes on the frosty air the buggy creaks on its springs and theres the rhythmic clip clop of hooves on the pavement
two amish buggies reach a crossroads join a procession of three others
they disappear as the lane wends through a leafless thicket of hickory
a big shot
now the procession numbers almost a dozen buggies
it is headed toward a distant farmhouse
where literally dozens of carriages are parked
the horses have been taken from the traces removed to the shelter of the barn
as the black clad mourners begin to move into the house women and children presumably first
the coffin has the upper half open
we see that the corpse has been dressed in white linen a piece of white linen partially covering the bearded face
partitions have been removed making the central rooms of the farmhouse a spacious hall
the place is packed a hundred fifty or more amish all sitting in absolute silence on rows of wooden benches
a wooden coffin rests on a bench in the f
and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy a special place
a young woman of perhaps twenty seven
her face is pale and drawn
in happier circumstances although there havent been too many of late in rachels life we would see a robust sensual woman of full figure spirit and intelligence
eight year old samuel lapp flits next to his mother he would appear stunned possibly not entirely comprehending events
and the patriarch eli lapp his stubborn weathered yet not unkind features grief stricken
as it begins to chime nine a
as he removes his hat
as one the men in the congregation remove their hats also
then the preacher begins to speak in a formal german dialect a brother has been called home
god has spoken through the death of our neighbor jacob lapp
where rachel samuel and eli are sitting sounds of emotion and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as husband of rachel father to samuel son of eli
and his chair is empty his bed is empty his voice will be heard no more
he was needed in our presence but god needs such men too
that one should be taken so suddenly
still we would not wish him back
rather we should prepare ourselves to follow him
tightening to the lapps and
the mourners have gathered about the grave standing in silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the pit
the many buggies are aligned in the b
as the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the grave the preacher begins to read a hymn in german
a slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty air
tightening to her as the hymn continues
where the amish have gathered for the traditional post funeral midday meals
long tables are laden with customary amishfare
crocks of soup hams fowl fried boiled eggs and pickled beets preserves and an infinite variety of pies and pastries
where she sits among women accepting their condolences
a brawny armed ruggedly handsome raffish looking amishman
there is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic set of mouth a bold eye a prominent set of jaw
not exactly what old jacob ammann had in mind maybe but a well set up man nonetheless and at ease among men
hes among a group of men including old stoltzfus the local healer fisher bieiler and bieilers stout young son tom
lapp was a good farmer
but not the man to buy a horse for you
and hochstetler wasnt it your father sold him that horse with a ruptured testicle
grins told him it was a bee sting made him limp that way
amused that horse had one good ball
thats all it takes
the others chuckle
but hochstetlers attention is still on rachel
as hochstetler looms on the horizon plants himself like a tree in front of her
at ease as he was with the men hes a bit awkward at this
all the women very much aware of hochstetlers availability tune in as rachel looks up
i was sorry to hear about jacob
let us hope he walks close with god
im sure he does daniel
it is some time after the funeral and the lapp family is hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing
the death of jacob has increased the work load on all three samuel maneuvers a four mule team while rachel and old eli work nearby further breaking up the earth
rachel looks up from the back breaking labor as several figures approach its daniel hochstetler and two of his brothers
without a word they fall in beside eli and rachel and take up various tasks associated with the work in hand
daniel works close beside rachel
a few brief shots of a lone buggy containing the lapp family take us from the th century into the th century the reassuring rattle of the carriage wheels on
quiet backroad to the roar of traffic as the buggy waits patiently for a chance to cross a busy interstate highway
a huge tractor trailer rig hovers over the frail buggy as it trots down the interstate
the camera cranes up to reveal a procession of vehicles behind the truck for a chance to overtake it
daniel hochstetler moves through the crowd on the plat form rachel turns surprised as he approaches a faint color coming to her cheek
i was at the feed store
and i saw your horse so
there is an embarrassment between them broken by the arrival of the train
you will come back soon
samuel can barely contain his excitement as he drags at his mothers hand
quickly mother quickly
rachel embraces eli
you be careful out among them english
she turns to hochstetler
i need time daniel
daniel hochstetler leaps into the driving seat of his open wagon and with a flick of the reins and a whoop sets his horse off at a fast trot
the engine gives a warning blast before creeping slowly forward
as samuel spots something out of the window that causes him to light up
a road runs parallel to the train track and hochstetler in his wagon urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts to keep pace with the train
as rachel smiles
i see darling
and samuel cranes to look back waving for as long as he can
the train moves across a broad panorama of fields dotted with dolls house sized farms and the tiny figures of amish farmers working their horse drawn equipment
as the train continues its eastward journey
samuel stares raptly out of the window at the changing patterns of the countryside
he points in wonder at a brightly colored hot air balloon as it drifts slowly over timbered hills
he looks unsure as the pattern of field and wood gives way to suburbs bustling shopping centers restaurants car lots and fast food outlets
as the train travels past dilapidated row houses streets choked with cars and the gutters with filth
now samuel is staring out the window with some confusion almost apprehension is this where were going
of course not
were going to baltimore
its much nicer in baltimore
and rachel draws her son closer turning her back on the window
rachel is in a line at one of the counters
the plain dress of the two amish particularly samuels black coat and hat are drawing curious stares
hes uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a little girl about his own age standing in line with her parents at the next counter
he edges away from his mother
as samuel comes upon a figure garbed in a long black frock coat and flat brimmed hat
the mans back is turned could from appearances be an amishman
a beat the man turns to face samuel and we discover that he is a hasidic jew
as he reacts
as rachels turn arrives
the ticket seller glances up and she shows him her ticket
we have a ticket to baltimore
where is that train please
delayed three hours
youll hear an announcement when its time to board
he starts to go without his hat but rachel collars him and puts it on his head
as samuel enters
its a long row of sinks urinals and stalls
samuel stops before one of the urinals a long trough like affair with water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel
its set a little high for samuel and it is making glugging flushing noises that are at least intimidating
samuel stares for a moment then turns looks toward the stalls stoops to see which are empty
beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible
samuel is alone in the restroom
as samuel proceeds along the row of door finally selects a stall near the end
as he does so a heavily bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters
with some urgency he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind a paper towel dispenser
suddenly he glances up
two other men have entered the mens room one is a large black man in a three piece suit under an expensive overcoat
his partner is a caucasian in designer jeans half boots and a short leather jacket
they advance on the young man with unmistakable menace
the young man whirls in terror his two assailants lunge for him
a savage wordless struggle ensues in the close confines of the lavatory
as the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall
he can see their feet under the edge of the door
as the struggle builds to a climax
ends with the young man stiffening with a grunt his face draining of color
the two attackers step away the blade in the black mans hand bloodstained
his partner stares at what theyve accomplished with a stunned expression jesus
the young mans hand comes away from his belly covered with blood
he stares at it staggers toward the sinks
finally his bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror
then he collapses to the floor
the black man motions for his partner to watch the door then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind the dispenser
as he edges open the stall door a crack
over his shoulder we can see the black man his back to us rifling the backpack
but beyond him in the mirror on the far wall we catch sight of the black mans face
as he stares out the narrow crack
a beat then he closes the stall door
samuel tries to make the latch work but its warped and wont fall closed
as he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket
his partner is covering the door an automatic in his hand
the black man makes for the exit then on second thought glances at the row of stalls
all quiet but
the black man whips out a
caliber revolver and starting at the near end starts pushing open the stall doors
as the black man approaches samuel working desperately on the latch
at the last minute he finally wedges it in
he elbows samuels stall
the door wont open
fighting back panic samuel has retreated as far as he can
as he gives the door a kick
he swears under his breath
in desperation samuel does the only thing he can think of
he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the black man just checked out
but he loses his hat in the process
his hand snakes back into frame to snatch it just as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its
hes framed there the big muzzle of the
revolver looking down our throats
as his partner snaps from the doorway will you come on for christs sakes
a beat then the black man holsters his weapon turns to follow the partner out
as we hear the sound of the two men exiting the lavatory
a long beat then samuel opens the stall door a crack
samuels own face reflected in the blood smeared mirror
then panning down to the still figure of the young man lying in the crimson pool of his own blood on the floor
samuel sits close to his mother his face pale his eyes staring
rachel holds his hand tightly in hers as the torsos of various police and officials pass through foreground occasionally obscuring the lonely couple
there is considerable echoing noise as commands and requests mingle with the crackle of the diffused shape of faces behind the frosted glass of the mens room door which is
pushed open to reveal john book who comes striding through to be momentarily lost in the crowd of police reporters and others
he is about with a rangy athletic body
behind him comes carter books black partner about five years younger than book
book is wearing a suit carter is much more casually almost disreputably dressed
little samuel watching book back to crowd of police as book questions an old black custodian
you found the body
not me daddy i just reported it
it was the kid
hown hell do i know what kid
the kid in the funny black threads
worry eyed still staring straight ahead
then his eyes move suddenly to his left
coming in at full stride then stopping
he doesnt raise his eyes
just looks at the legs
and slowly the legs begin to bend at the knees
we see books belt buckle then his big pistol in its holster then his face
he stares at samuel for a moment then
as his face breaks into a big grin and
immediately alarmed intervening
what do you want of my son
as book takes out his wallet displays his shield
im a police officer
im going to have to talk to the boy
whats his name
then quickly but what happened here is none of his affair
my sister is expecting me
our train is leaving soon
therell be another train
turns to samuel the man who was killed tonight was a policeman sam
its my job to find out who did it
i want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there
stammers i saw him
whod you see
sam looks at his mother
whod you see sam
the man on the floor
i saw the man who killed him
book stares at him in surprise speaks over his shoulder to carter
anybody know about this
i didnt even know about it
back to sam okay sam
can you tell me what he looked like
groping touching his clothes and pointing at carter he was
what else sam
a beat then sam crosses quickly to carter books rather slightly built partner not zwartich like him book frowns puzzled try that one again sam samuel gives his mother a
helpless look exasperated rachel intervenes with book
she glances at carter may i talk to you
as rachel takes book aside and in a low voice zwartich
its the way we say
glances at carter not like him
book nods starts to turn back to sam
just then a commotion off screen catches his attention
terry donahue chief of homicide striding past the crowd of journalists and tv crews
brushing off reporters questions and snapping orders to the aides hes got in tow to aides close it all down
i want a man on every exit
i want the lab in here now
to book and i want to talk to you captain
as book steps aside with donahue
in the b
rachel moves protectively to samuels side
all right talk
this is homicide not internal affairs
so why are you behaving like you own this case
we were running zenovitch
thats all i can tell you
but i want it terry
then ive got a call into schaeffer
they cant help but watch the confrontation between donahue and book
although theyre keeping the volume down its obviously intense and angry alarmed momma
are they angry with us
reassuring but hardly in her own mind no
it is just the english way
donahue has lost the confrontation he gives book a smile you ought to think about coming back to homicide johnny
stick with internal affairs and youre not gonna have any friends left
smiles right back ill buy a dog
book emerges from the terminal looks about him then crosses to a big mercury sedan which is parked nearby
two men sit in the front seat
book crosses to the drivers side and opens the door
go get a cup of coffee stan
the driver a uniformed policeman glances at the man beside him who nods in agreement
he gets out and book gets in behind the wheel
book sits next to schaeffer a surprisingly kindly looking man of about fifty
schaeffer is a deputy chief
how reliable is this kid
oh hes good
what have you got
zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight street chemists
the guys processing this p p into speed
so one of them got to him
you know who
youre still convinced theres a link to the department
if there isnt ive just wasted the last six months
thats the problem
we need results
the press is driving us crazy over this p p thing
calling us the speed capitol of the country
you know the sort of thing
its getting political
the commissioners getting very uneasy
the amish boy saw him paul
ill make it but set donahue and the homicide department off my back or theyll blow the whole thing
when word gets out that zenovitch was a cop all hell will break lose
youve got hours
thats all i can give you
hours on your own
after that the case and the witness go back to the homicide department
shakes his head tell you what
why dont you and that blonde whats her name come over for dinner sunday
how bout that
whats her name moved to buffalo
sighs well anyway dont get crazy
dismisses him ill do something for zenovichs wife
book drives around th street a ravaged corridor between neon lit restaurants bars porno shops and darkened storefronts
carter sits beside him rachel and her son in the back seat looking out at the assorted array of desperate characters huddled in doorways or wandering aimlessly about
on the police radio a description of the cop killing is broadcast i got there late john
lets just find coalmine
beat listen zenovich made a mistake
you didnt let anybody down
it happens grimly it wont happen again
where are you taking us
were looking for a suspect
weve reason to believe hes still in the area
you have no right to keep us here
yes i do
your son is a material witness to a homicide
you dont understand we have nothing to do with your laws
doesnt surprise me
i meet a lot of people like that
its not a joke
book decides to try contrition youre right
its not a joke
listen i know a little about the amish
i know this has to be an ordeal for you and im really sorry you an samuel got involved
samuel shoots a look at book then mutters something to his mother in german
she responds in the same language
what was that
he wants to know who you are
i told him we dont need to know anything about you
book eyes samuel book
john book books car stops and from out of the shadows darts a wizened little man
he looks about before crossing to the drivers side window
book lowers the window
sammy wheres coalmine
the little man stares at the weird looking couple in the back seat
what you got there the salvation army
try happy valley
books car pulls up outside the bar and he and carter get out and move swiftly inside
sixty black faces stare as the police enter
a hush falls on the group
book and carter spot their man at the bar and move up either side of him
theyve moved carefully to this point
from the back the black man theyve approached certainly looks like he could be the man who did the killing of zenovitch
and as book and carter make their move
as book and carter explode through the door of the bar violently propelling coalmine along with them
now we see coalmine is not the killer
as book and carter escort coalmine out of the bar a police squad car pulls up its headlights shining into books car
an alarmed rachel holds samuel close as book forces coalmines face down next to the car window
put some light on him
a cop pulls out a flashlight begins to play the beam over coalmines face
continuing to samuel look at him
crazy as rasputin on speed and booze coalmine glares at samuel inside the car samuel white faced finally shakes his head in the negative
coalmine tries to twist free of books grip
book snaps and slams coalmines skull into the window edge finally crushing his face up against the front window
his face takes on a grotesque shape against the glass
carter restrains his partner and book cools down
coalmine is led stumbling away by the uniformed police
this sudden show of violence has horrified and angered rachel and she glares at book as he gets back in the car
john book you listen to me
i will have no further part in this nor will my son
as god stands between us
book sighs starts the engine and moves off
book pulls up outside a hotel entrance as a uniformed doorman moves to open the rear door
rachel and sam recoil as the doorman opens the door
he is puzzled by the sight of the reluctant guests
we do not stay in hotels
book and carter exchange a glance
an attractive woman in her early thirties in robe and slippers stares in disbelief as rachel and sam file into the house
this is elaine books sister
she stops book as he tries to follow rachel inside
how could you do this to me tonight
i told you i had company sorry
as she glances in a doorway
its a shambles with dirty supper dishes piled sink the table littered with empty beer cans
as she hustles samuel along
book frowns wheres timmy and buck
whered you think
youve got a man here and the kids are upstairs
thats none of your goddamn business
so keep your goddamn holier than thou mouth shut
and anyway they like fred
oh sure fred
elaine looks like shes going to blow again then decides its pointless
who are these orphans anyway
samuel is asleep in one twin bed in a tiny cluttered room
rachel in a plain nightgown is preparing to climb into the other one
off screen we hear a door close presumably book leaving
a beat then elaine opens the door and looks in
yes thank you very much
a beat john said youre amish
she nods and goes
rachel crosses to samuel sits on the bed
samuel looks up at her bleakly
i dont want to stay here
they are english
they dont understand
i wish dawdie was with us
swallows i know
sleep now liebchen
she puts her hand on his forehead closes his eyes
she frowns and
carter exits the cafe carrying burgers donuts and a couple of beers
book wakes from a brief nap as carter gets into the car
book chews into his burger while carter takes a doughnut
its clear theyve worked through the night
elaines house is situated on the corner of a row of terraces which stretch into the distance on both sides of the street
as samuel comes out of the guest room in his night shirt turns up the hall and opens the door to the bathroom
but its not the bathroom its elaines bedroom
she and fred are tangled in the sheets furiously making love
elaine gasps fred manages to grunt
wrong door kid
as samuel quickly shuts the door
a straight faced beat then barely suppressing a giggle he hurries on
as rachel appears in the living room entry
samuel is sitting on the floor with two boys of about his own age watching television
theyre eating cold cereal out of a box
some artless saturday morning cartoon
as she frowns watching her son and the other two staring hypnotically
its later in the morning now as elaine a bit blearily appears in the entryway stares in groggy disbelief
her oldest boy and samuel are busily washing the windows while her youngest is pushing a carpet sweeper
the tv is off
as she stares
rachel is standing in the middle of the now immaculate kitchen finishing a brisk mop of the floor
the coffee is perking
rachel turns cheerily
helplessly you didnt have to
i wanted to
you were kind to take us in last night
and anyway i needed something to do
i was so angry with your brother
yeah that sounds like john
she takes a seat at the table still shaking her head
just a minute
ill pour you some coffee
youre not carrying a bullwhip
howd you manage to put my kids to work
smiles i made it a contest
the one who does best gets his cereal back first
and children like to help
they only need to be kept after a little bit
rachel means no harm by this but elaines eyes begin to storm
oh is that so
and no offense lady but im not so sure i like the idea of your coming in here and turning the place upside down
rachels smile fades at elaines trembling outburst please i didnt mean
abruptly elaine rises and snatches the mop from rachels hands
she mops furiously as she continues i know exactly what you meant
listen maybe im not a world class housefrau but maybe i dont have time to polish the goddamn china and keep after the kids
and its none of your business but i dont happen to have a man around here full time
so i sell cosmetics in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes i can even pay the rent on time
so maybe im not mary poppins but maybe i dont need to have it jammed down my throat like this
she finishes the floor hurls the mop aside with a clatter there is that clean enough for you
rachel is speechless elaine is on the point of bursting into tears
at which point fred appears at the entry in his undershirt taking in the sparkling kitchen
somebody die and leave you a broom
not a politic observation on freds part
blurts go to hell fred
and bursting into tears she flees the kitchen
fred stares after her
whats bugging her
unperturbed he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot letting his eyes take in rachels full figure
as rachel comes in with elaines coffee closes the door behind her
elaine is lying across the bed sobbing
i brought your coffee
she takes a seat next to the bed
i didnt mean it that way
after a moment elaine starts to pull herself together its okay
and look i shouldnt have blown my top
ive let everything get away from me
and you sort of made me face it
she takes the cup sips the coffee
rachel smiles at a private thought
whats so funny
the way he looked when you screamed at him
disparing god fred
at home youd never hear a woman scream at a man that way
you just wouldnt
its not the amish way
then but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night
listen i dont know whats going on or how you got mixed up with him but dont you let that self righteous son of a bitch push you around okay
book glances irritably at rachel now whats the problem
the problem is i dont happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking
book gives her a look whacking
and i also want to leave this city
believe me im trying to get this over with as fast as i can
but samuel will probably have to come back and testify
we do not go into your courts
people who dont go into our courts when theyre told to sometimes go directly into our jail
rachel glares at him and the ride continues on that chilly note for a beat
look im genuinely sorry
snaps no youre not off his look youre glad because now youve got a witness
and i heard the other police talking last night
and they dont seem to like you very much
they kid a lot
glances at him i would not be too sure
samuel has been glancing at book finally he says something to his mother in german
book gives her an inquiring look
he says you look very tired
i thought the same thing
book says nothing
but not a good tired
whats a good tired
tired is tired
she doesnt bother to explain book settles even deeper into his funk as samuel glares at him with hostility
samuel sits with book at a desk rachel just behind
they are looking at a police line up of known black drug dealers
samuel shakes his head another negative
book winks slyly reaches into a pocket produces a yellow gumball
he surreptitiously shows it to samuel gives him an inquiring look
its a peace offering
samuel grins nods imperceptibly
as book rolls the gumball down the table to samuel
but just as samuel is about to cover it with his hand rachel reaches over and plucks it off the table
she shakes her head at samuel
to rachel just wanted to see if you were on your toes
book sam and rachel sit on a park bench eating a lunch of hot dogs heaped with kraut
book watches with amusement as samuel wolfs down his lunch
rachel eyes him a beat
then your sister said you dont have a family
she thinks you should get married and have children of your own
instead of trying to be a father to hers
except she thinks youre afraid of the responsibility
book gives her a look oh
she thinks you like policing because you think youre right about everything
and youre the only one who can do anything
and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a
bag of elbows
book is staring at her
i think thats what she said
just then samuel belches with huge satisfaction drawing looks from book and a couple of passersby
rachel smiles proudly
rachel sits uneasily in the outer office one or two police clerks eyeing her curiously
a sign on the desk reads narcotics division
rachel cranes forward trying to peer through a partially open door
a group of narcotics detectives are interrupted in mid conversation by the opening of the main office door
they stare in considerable surprise
standing in the doorway holding little samuel by the hand
id like you to meet samuel lapp
wed like a little help
a narcotics detective enters the room laden with several volumes of mug shots
he puts them on the desk beside a similar book which samuel is intently studying
sam sits on the chair cushions in a big swivel rocker
the detective sgt
kaman eyes book a little suspiciously internal affairs officers are not greeted warmly by the working policemen in any department
theres a sgt
carter on the phone for you
book gets up and moves to the door
and captain dont want to rush you but im gonna need these files back in a half hour
we got a lot of work to do round here
the two men leave
samuel looks about before hopping off his perch and following the direction taken by book
through glass partitions we can see book on the telephone in a cubicle of an office
samuel has drifted out of the office and is idling amid the bustle of the squadroom
he crosses to a glass case which holds a collection of plaques and framed newspaper accounts which denote instances of outstanding duty and achievement
as samuel moves along only half interested in what his eyes are taking in not really old enough to comprehend anyway
until suddenly he freezes
enlarged prominently displayed
the headline reads division chief mcelroy honored for youth project
accompanying the item is a large sidebar mug shot of mcelroy clearly the black man who murdered the young cop in the train station mens room
he stares transfixed
a long beat then book lowering himself to one knee next to samuel enters frame
hes watching samuel knowing from the boys expression that theyve found their man
samuel slowly raises his hand to point at the photograph
book gently takes the boys small hand in his concealing the accusation from watchful eyes
he smiles gently at the boy
rachel is curled tight in her corner of the front seat holding samuel close
book glances at her why dont you arrest that man
are you protecting him because policeman
snaps listen im the cop that polices the police
im not in the business of protecting crooked cops
eases up ill make an arrest when i know everybody involved
rachel shakes her head
but why would they murder
because somehow they knew i was getting close
and look its narcotics
they make dope out of chemicals
they sell it on the street for millions of dollars
theyll do anything
and and they can get away with it because theyre cops
beat then im afraid
im afraid for samuel
i want to go home
youll be safe
you dont have to worry
she says nothing
another beat then look theyre thinking as long as they keep the killer out of samuels way we cant make an i
theres no way they can know samuel saw that photograph so hes safe
he glances at her but she continues ahead
i mean it
you will be safe
suddenly rachel explodes oh yes
why shouldnt we feel safe in a city where the police are so busy killing each other
the front door of schaeffers upper middle class home is opened by his wife marilyn
she knows book and is surprised and delighted to see him
in the background daughter kathy is visible
schaeffer himself appears and book is welcomed inside
schaeffer passes book a drink
book is excited animated
the hunter after a long chase closing on his quarry it was mcelroy paul
schaeffer gives him a sharp look last guy i would have figured
but hes part of it
i hope you dont have any doubts about that
if i did id have kept my mouth shut
and it fits paul
fifty five gallons of p p confiscated four years ago
guess who was in on the collar
excited explaining the thing eagerly he salts it away somewhere
he knows the stuff is potent but the street chemists havent figured out how to process it
but they do now
and and now the stuff is worth five grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty five gallon drum
beat who else knows
shakes his head okay what are you going to need to clean it up more people
gotta pick up where zenovich left off
people from outside the department
nods maybe the bureau
or those bastards at treasury
ill take care of it
then i hate this shit johnny
you cut their balls off for me
im counting on you
schaeffer pours himself another drink
whats your first move
expels a breath a hot shower
i havent changed clothes in two days
book slams the front door of his car checks it for being locked glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand the sports section of the inquirer starts across the
parking lot toward his apartment walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports section
he comes to a sort of crosswalk stops reads starts to take a step
and looks up
mcelroy smiling nicely starting across toward him from the other side of the parking lot crosswalk freezing eyes widening
utterly surprised and caught
still smiling he brings up his right hand out of a shopping bag which he appeared to be carrying letting the shopping bag fall away as he does so revealing
a five inch barrel smith and wesson
blue finish revolver with a silencer
without hesitating coming right on still smiling he fires once
already starting to leap away to one side he is hit driven into a half turn
he clutches at the wound as coming right on firing again
the pistols report a whooshing like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne
and mcelroy still smiling as hit
a grazing near miss this time but enough to send book down hard and grasping
lowering the pistol alongside his leg as two men barely taking notice of anything cross with their backs to book toward mcelroy
he smiles at them
down muttering curses
as mcelroy walks past book drops the pistol to the pavement keeps on going
and is gone
groaning in pain beginning to try to crawl crab like
and we hear from the agonized recesses of books dream
who else knows
as the lights of an oncoming car going very slowly on its way to a parking space sweep over him and we hear it come to a sudden squealing stop
book is already trying to get to his feet
now succeeds lurching into a swaying stance using an adjacent car for support
off screen we hear a car door slam and footsteps hurrying in our direction accompanied by excited voices
book hears turns to face the oncomers a fat middle aged man has approached to within some feet of book looks on edgily hey buddy whats the score
little too much to drink
book stares at him then looks down at his belly
as book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck him low in the side just below the ribcage
the other just above it but this one inflicting only minor damage
as the man stares goddamn buddy
you better get to a hospital
and here ill give you a hand
he starts to approach but book shoves him away
by now the mans wife is hovering at a safe distance let him alone henry
if he wants to die in the street thats his business
but the man is not content shut up romona
will ya look at that blood
book has tried to lurch toward his car the man tries to intercept him come on buddy
youre gonna bleed to death
book whirls on him his service revolver in his hand pointed squarely at the fat mans face shit
quavering i told you henry
book doesnt trust himself to speak but the
is sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances he stares at the fat man another beat then hesitates turns starts back toward his car
as books car wheels somewhat erratically through traffic
book has a gym bag open on the seat next to him is stuffing a tshirt under his belt to staunch the blood
as hes awakened by the ringing bedside telephone
he snaps on a lamp
hes instantly awake not unused to such rousing in the wee hours
a woman sleeps beside him
hes at an n
listen carefully i wrote the amish womans name and address on my desk calendar i want you to lose it for me now
what the hell are you talking about
im not going to be around for a while
ill call you when i can
alarmed johnny what the fuck
hard listen to me schaeffers part of it
maybe at the top of it
theres a stunned silence at the other end
i can put it all together when i get back til then you know nothing understand
business as usual
beat i hear you
take care of that womans name for me
and watch your ass
as the door opens and elaine switches on the light rousing rachel
elaine looks haggard
he says you have to leave now
he says its urgent
she leaves the room as rachel instantly awake moves quickly to rouse samuel
elaine is outside the bathroom listening to instructions from her brother
from inside we hear the sound of running water
elaine is puzzled but also senses the urgency
put my car in the garage and close the door
john i dont understand any of this
snaps you dont know anything
borrowed your car
didnt say why
and you never heard of that woman and her boy
shouts just do it
book looks at himself in the mirror his face is pale and drawn
he examines the wound a cleanly drilled hole through his right side just under the rib cage
the wound continues to bleed as he binds a towel tightly about him before putting his shirt back on
he then carefully wipes away any traces of blood on basin with tissues which he flushes down the toilet
as he drives across town
samuel is curled up asleep his head on rachels lap
where are you taking us now
you couldnt wait until morning
book gives her a look
insistent what happened
but book glancing in his rearview mirror tenses
in it we can see a police car coming on fast with lights and siren
rachel eyes book warily
a beat then the police car wails past
book expels a breath
you said we would be safe in philadelphia
i was wrong
rachel looks away speaks almost sarcastically muttering
kinner un narre
kinner un narre saage die waahret children and fools say the truth amish expressions angle past books desk calendar
carter enters in the b
crosses quickly to the desk
he snaps on a light thumbs a page of the calendar
rachels name and address scribbled on a page of the calendar
a couple of plainclothesmen have paused outside the door to give him a look
meets their eyes
they move on
carter shakes it off goes
as light colors the eastern horizon book is crossing into lancaster county
book glances at rachel shes asleep
he coughs wrackingly hurting
cinches the belt of his overcoat even tighter
coming up the long drive
as the car pulls up in the barnyard and eli crosses to it
suddenly the car door flies open and samuel jumps out races across the barnyard to hurl himself into the old man
as rachel steps out of the passengers side book remains seated
he lets his eyes travel around the farm
stay for awhile
ill make coffee and breakfast
what about samuel
will you come back to take him to trial
book starts the engine grimly there isnt going to be one
rachel stares at him not sure what he means
then backs away closing the door
book begins to turn the car around in the barnyard
as eli crosses to rachel his arm around samuel
who was that man
his name is john book
eli is about to inquire further when samuel cries momma look
they glance in the direction samuel is looking
the car has failed to take a bend in the road and is now bouncing across an adjoining ploughed field
its knocked over a tall birdhouse by the roadside
the car finally comes to rest against a bank of earth
as samuel races for all hes worth across the field negotiates the creek via a fallen log rachel now also running toward the car
eli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon
he hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot
we see that rachel has made book as comfortable as possible in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under his trenchcoat with material ripped from
momentarily he comes awake but john
why didnt you go to a hospital
no no doctor
bewildered but why
theyll file reports
theyll find me
but book reaches up to grip her arm fiercely and when they find me theyll find your boy
he slips under again
rachel stares at him realizing the price hes paid in returning them to safety
she reaches out touches him gently
but the moment is broken by
as eli reins up in the springwagon
he climbs down crosses to glance into the car
is the english dead
and together they begin to lift book from the car and place him in the back of the springwagon
where eli is looking out a window
an amish buggy coming up the drive past book s car
where book lies on a bed
rachel is bathing his wound with warm water from a pan
eli appears in the doorway
stoltzfus is coming
rachel looks at him nods
eli frowns at books holstered pistol lying atop his neatly folded clothes on a chair near the bed
that has no place in this house
she picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places them in a chest
it will go when he goes
as samuel comes in with old stoltzfus and stoltzfuss teenage son levi
thank you for coming stoltzfus
stoltzfuss eyes have gone to the bed thats the english is it
as stoltzfus runs his fingers lightly over the vicinity of books wound i feel
as stoltzfus in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily moistens his fingertips with saliva continues the examination
finally he steps back
this man should be treated in town
indicates the bullet entered there
and came out there
but there is the danger of infection and he has lost a great deal of blood
rachel looks at stoltzfus then turns away torn by her dilemma
her eyes fall on samuel
gently she ushers him from the room go help levi with the car samuel
she closes the door after him then turns to face eli and stoltzfus no he must stay here
stoltzfus gives eli a puzzled look
and didnt you hear stoltzfus
what if he dies
then the sheriff will come
theyll say we broke their laws well pray that he doesnt die
but if he does then well find a way so no one knows
rachel this is a mans life we hold it in our hands
i know god help me i know that eli
then but i tell you that if hes found here the people who did this to him will come for samuel
rachel beseeches them helplessly what else can we do
levi has hitched elis mules to the rear of books car and is towing it up the drive toward the barn with samuel catching a ride on the bumper
where shes waiting with the big barn doors thrown open
as the mules tow the car in she closes the doors
as stoltzfus and levi are about to go stoltzfus turns to rachel make a poultice
three parts milk two parts linseed oil
for the infection
ill send mary by with some teas i will brew myself
stoltzfus turns to eli lapp ill have to speak with the diener on this matter
nods as you see fit stoltzfus
as rachel enters turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning low at bedside
shes carrying the poultice stoltzfus ordered
books brow is beaded with sweat
rachel seats herself next to the bed strips away the sweat soaked sheet
her eyes take in his bare torso and we should get the feeling that theres rather more male animal on display here just now than shes quite comfortable with
she begins to apply the poultice
as book rouses to semi consciousness in his delirium he recoils with alarm
its all right
you have got to lie still
book stares up at her without recognition but some of what she says seems to penetrate
soothingly yes much better
as book lapses back into sleep
rachel hasnt removed her hand from his chest
abruptly she does so
she finds herself wondering about this man lying before her so suddenly a part of her life
she notices details bruises scars the knuckles are hard grazed a tattoo on one shoulder
while lost in this reverie the delirious philadelphia policeman begins to mutter
incoherently at first then the words take shape swear words curses fuck this and that shit etc
rachel rises abruptly her cheeks coloring as the barrage of language pours from his mouth
she beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind her
hes on the phone looks like were going to need some help from you folks down there
where an undersheriff is on the phone want to help any way we can chief but you got to understand weve got upwards of seven thousand amish over here
and thats just lancaster county
who is trying to control his impatience ive got the womans name sheriff
that should simplify your work
the undersheriff frowns
he doesnt like being talked down to
how about an address
frowns maybe a road or route number
the undersheriff is not impressed
problem is chief bout every third amishman around here is named lapp
that or yoder
and chief if the amish have taken your man in i wouldnt want to hang from a rope until you find him
schaeffer is tight lipped with contained fury thank you sheriff
its been an education
he hangs up
a beat the man is a study in frustration
then he glances up
standing in his doorway are the two plainclothesmen who spotted carter in books office in the earlier scene
a bright sunny afternoon
where hes leading a team of horses to the barn
in the b
three buggies are parked in the barnyard traces empty
where book lies in the bed
his fever seems to have subsided
hes coming awake tries to focus on the room
panning the four men in amish black who are standing around the bed looking down at book muttering among themselves in german
these include tschantz the district bishop a hawk nosed sterneyed old fellow stoltzfus a deacon as well as a healer and two preachers erb and hershberger
eli stands somewhat apart
another moment of silence then book opens his eyes
tschantz rumbles in german
well stoltzfus another lazarus to your credit
he was touched by gods hand
tschantz grunts motions for the other clergy aside with him
rachel enters briskly with a steaming pot of tea and a cup smiles
book stares at her then at the old bearded gentlemen
closing his eyes who are they
the leadership of our district
bishop tschantz is the one with no hair on top
they decided to come and see you for themselves
except stoltzfus of course
he came the first day
i think he saved your life
can i have something to drink
rachel brings him tea
does anybody know im here
only the elders
how long have i been here
a beat listen thank you
thanks for everything
but ive got to go
frowns but you cant
he tries to rise falls back faint
rachel rearranges the sheet
anyway you dont have any clothes on
and besides that bishop tschantz wants to talk to you when you feel better
the elders appear to have concluded their conference and are filing out
stoltzfus pauses at bedside
thats the ticket
and drink my of my tea
book is still fending off the dizziness
rachel puts the teacup to his lips
tell him his tea stinks
smiles you tell him
when youre able
he looks like hes about to drop off again
from the door were all very happy that youre going to live john book
we didnt quite know what we were going to do with you if you died
that penetrates for a moment just before book slips into sleep again
as the rather worrisome hershberger frowns but a gunshot wound
it is not the first time we have done this
in the englischer war of the revolution old elmer millers grandfather took in gunshot english soldiers
a tad of pride saved them too
they all nod
what tschantz says is well known
then still he should be among his own people
rachel enters on this last
hell leave as soon as he is able
he already wants to go
hershberger gives her a gloomy look turns to stoltzfus how long will that be stoltzfus
shrugs a month
with gods healing love
schaeffer is knocking at the front doors
a beat then elaine opens it cautiously peers out
half fearfully did you find him
suddenly her eyes blaze she starts to close the door then go away you bastard
schaeffer quickly but gently prevents her from shutting it
elaine ive come to apologize for lt
he overstated the departments position
bitterly he accused john of taking kickbacks
and you know anybody who knows john knows thats a goddamn lie
smoothly of course elaine
but as long as theres any question better johnny should come back and clear his name
cuts in better you should get off my front porch before i get my mace
elaine i dont want to have to take you in for questioning
youve got his car you were the last to see him clipped i dont know where he is
if you had to guess
we see a final exchange between elaine and schaeffer
elaine forces the door shut
schaeffer turns walks slowly to his car
as schaeffer opens the door climbs in sinks wearily into the seat beside mcelroy
she say where he is
i dont think she knows
schaeffer is staring grimly ahead
what about carter
but im working on him
lean on him
reestablishing and tightening to the upstairs sickroom window where a lamp dimly burns
as samuel comes in with a fresh bedpan
book is lying asleep on the bed
samuel puts the bedpan down checks to make sure book is indeed asleep then quietly crosses to the foot of the bed and opens the clothes chest
revolver lies holstered atop his folded clothes
fascinated samuel picks it up admiring the heavy burled pistol grips
unable to resist he starts to remove the weapon from the holster then pauses to steal a look
his eyes are open and watching samuel icily which gives the boy something of a jolt
give me that
mutely samuel hands book the pistol from arms length
he looks on as book takes the pistol out of the holster shoots the boy another look then snaps open the cylinder and shakes out the heavy copper jacketed bullets
into his palm
he snaps the cylinder closed again then nods to samuel
the boy edges closer
you ever handle a pistol like this samuel
swallows no pistol
tell you what im going to let you handle this one
but only if you promise not to say anything to your momma
ive got a feeling she wouldnt understand
grins okay mr
then he gives the boy a playful john wayne tough guy wink as he cocks and uncorks the pistol demonstrating the action
he finally hands it over to samuel butt first
call me john
the boy tries to imitate books one handed expertise but his hands are too small
samuel finally manages to get the thing cocked using two hands and book reaches over to guide the muzzle away so that its not pointed at him
you dont want to point that at people you just started calling by their first name
samuel levels the pistol at the door and just as he snaps the trigger rachel enters pulls up short in some dismay to find her son has a gun pointed
samuel blanches and book winces knowing theres heavy weather ahead
samuel quickly hands the pistol back to book who holsters it wait for me downstairs
samuel quickly exits and rachel angrily advances on book
john book i would appreciate it if during the time you are with us you would have as little to do with samuel as possible
nobody meant any harm
the boy was curious
i unloaded the gun its not the gun
dont you understand
what you stand for
and that is not for samuel
book looks at her thoughtfully
rachel softens a bit please it has nothing to do with you personally
he hands her the holstered gun and the loose bullets
put it up someplace samuel cant get it
a beat then rachel takes the pistol and starts to go
book stops her friends
rachel glances back at him smiles and nods
books holstered gun and bullets at center table
eli sits on one side a chastened samuel on the other
rachel looks on from the b
eli knows that this is as important a dialogue as he will ever have with his grandson at issue is one of the central pillars of the amish way
the gun that gun of the hand is for the taking of human life
would you kill another man
samuel stares at it not meeting his grandfathers eyes
eli leans forward extends his hands ceremonially
what you take into your hands you take into your heart
a beat then samuel musters some defiance
i would only kill a bad man
only a bad man
and you know these bad men on sight
you are able to look into their hearts and see this badness
i can see what they do
now he meets elis eyes i have seen it
eli expels a deep sigh then and having seen you would become one of them
gesturing dont you see
the hand leads the arm leads the shoulder leads the head
leads the heart
the one goes into the other into the other into the other
and you have changed and gone amongst them
he breaks off bows his head for a moment
then he fixes the boy with a stern eye and driving he heel of his palm firmly into the tabletop with enormous intensity wherefore come out from among them and
be ye separate saith the lord
indicating pistol continuing from corinthians and touch not the unclean thing
his intensity tinged with righteous anger he is hugely impressive
book stands near the door to the kitchen and has heard most or all of elis words
he turns and painfully makes his way into the washhouse moving quietly hoping no one will come out from the kitchen
samuel harnesses up the family mare and backs her into the traces of the buggy
book stands at the window in a worn robe
below through the window we can see samuel and eli in the barnyard
a beat then book crosses impatiently back to his bed sits down picks up a dog earred copy of the american dairyman
theres a stack of well thumbed farm magazines and copies of the budget the amish newspaper on the bedside table
theres a knock
rachel enters carrying a pile of clothing
enjoying your reading
im learning a lot about manure
eyes the clothing whats that
your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood
i have them soaking
you can wear these
she passes the clothes to book
its good that someone can have the use of them
besides in your clothes youd stand out to strangers
she continues cheerfully
i should tell you these do not have buttons
shows him see
hooks and eyes
something wrong with buttons
buttons are hochmut
such a person is hochmutsnarr
he is not plain
nodding anything against zippers
almost blushing you make fun of me
like the tourists
driving by all the time
some even come into the yard
they seem to think we are quaint
cant imagine why
wheres the nearest telephone
the gunthers across the valley
they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even
id want a public phone
rachels face clouds
the store at saltzburg
then briskly but you wont be going to saltzburg for a while
im going this morning
but stoltzfus said
cutting in i know what he said
you can go with eli
hes taking samuel to school
but youll have to hurry
rachel turns to leave when book calls her back
she turns to look at him
its the first time hes used her name
she smiles and leaves
eli calls impatiently from the buggy
samuel sits beside him
hurry up now john book
rachel washing dishes turns on hearing book enter
she laughs out loud at the sight of him in his amish gear and rightly so the pants are highwater the hat low rise the jacket ill fitting
book looks self conscious even a little sheepish
outside another shout from eli
youd better go
book looks embarrassed
the smile fades from rachels face as she reaches up into a cupboard
she passes the gun in its holster to book
he fastens it about him
the contradiction of an armed amishman increases the awkwardness between them
book turns his back to her and checks the weapon
he turns back to her smiling in an odd way
she takes them out of a disused coffee jar passes them to book
attempting a joke not much good without them
samuel sits between eli and book
both men stare straight ahead
eli looks particularly stern
its pretty clear he doesnt like this englishman wearing the clothes of his faith
with awave samuel runs into the schoolyard to join his friends
a teacher begins ringing a bell
book on the telephone waiting for his call to be answered
he looks about him several amish and dithers mingle in the shop
book has gotten a coke from a machine seems a bit self conscious shout it sips at it surreptitiously
a voice comes on the line its that of books partner
where the hell have you been
im coming in to take care of business
how hot am i
low urgent too hot
dont do it
dont come in
listen johnny dont do anything stupid
you couldnt get within a mile of schaeffer right now
so stay put
stay in touch ill let you know when maybe it makes sense
a beat as book considers that
edgily you hear me
finally i hear you
ill stay in touch
thats more like it
and where are you at anyway
book allows himself a small smile regarding his amish image reflected in the window of the store
where im at is maybe
uncomprehending say again
he hangs up
a beat then he stares toward the door of the store
book works on his car
the battery has gone flat and hes trying to charge it up by running wires to a battery mounted under the front seat of the lapp buggy
eli stands at the barn door staring at him again the disapproving look
if you are well enough to do that thing you can do work for me
book is genuinely apologetic
sure im sorry
hope you dont mind me plugging in to your battery
how can i help
what can i do
eyes eli milking
you know cows
ive seen pictures
good you start tomorrow
where book lies asleep
a beat then eli comes in carrying a lamp
he pauses a moment to peer at the sleeping figure with undisguised anticipation
then he gives him a jarring thump briskly veck oufl
time for milking
book comes groggily awake as eli exits
he gropes for his watch
it reads a
as he stares at it in disbelief
as the milk herd of half dozen or so cows ambles in with samuel prodding them along headed for the milking stalls
book looks on in the lamplight nonplused
where hes pitching hay into the cows feed troughs
where the old man is showing book how to milk a cow by hand
we see rachel watching from the milkhouse door steam from scalding milk cans rising behind her
good firm twist and pull eh
now you try it
book gives him a look takes over the milking stool
the cow shoots him a rather skeptical look over her shoulder
book bends to his task
didnt you hear me book
you never had your hands on a teat before
grimly not one this big
eli unexpectedly finds this hilarious cackles gives book a comradely man of the world thump on the shoulder that jars him
then he moves off
book bends to his task and
grinning giggling covering her mouth with one hand
as he pours a pail full of milk into a large stainless steel milk can
as the milk herd is released back into the pasture
book crosses into the f
stares off screen
and dawnfire etching the hilltops
the bellhouse behind the house the sun reflecting from the heavy bell beneath its small roof
something in him cant help but respond to the beauty
a beat then he blows on his hands rubs them briskly together against the morning chill and turns back to the barn
it is later in the morning
rachel comes out onto the porch tosses a pan of dirty dishwater off onto the grass looks toward the barn
eli and book standing in one of the open doorways looking in
angle favoring luke one of elis team of fine mules as samuel opens the stall gate
the beast is skittish obviously afflicted with something of a behavioral problem
but he allows samuel to lead him out
as samuel brings luke out
eli is now harnessing the other mule of the team to a large manure spreader
but as luke nears book his eyes widen and he shies almost hauling samuel off his feet
alarmed careful son book moves to samuels aid a gesture which proves a serious mistake
luke erupts into a screaming bucking cyclone
samuel who no doubt has been here before dives nimbly for cover as a flying hoof nearly takes books head off
then eli hustles into the fray pushing book aside as he bellows belligerently in german at the rearing animal
finally he gives luke a swat upside the head that seems somehow to have the effect of quieting the beast instantly
samuel gives the shaken book a look thats luke
he doesnt like strangers
still shaken you dont say
eli leads the pacified mule back to the traces grunting at book
have to teach you mules too i guess
book collects the pieces of the birdhouse which his car knocked down the day of his attempted departure
he pauses as a figure approaches
we recognize daniel hochstetler rachels would be suitor
he heads for book with an outgoing smile and outstretched hand
heres a likable man who likes people
book is it
you are the yankee they talk about
i thought i was the english
its the same
my name is daniel
sizes up his clothes you look plain book
grinning very plain
book is not particularly amused
i came to see rachel lapp
try the house
hochstetler gives book a powerful clap on the shoulder
genially you bet
you take care of yourself
hochstetler heads for the house
book stares after him with some interest
as rachel emerges from the house to greet him
she also catches sight of book and she pauses a shadow of confusion crossing her expression for an instant
and hochstetler doesnt miss it either
then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome
book having gathered up the pieces of the bird house is headed toward the outbuildings passing by hog pens
he glances toward the house where rachel and hochstetler are sitting in a porch swing sharing a pitcher of lemonade
he glances at the hog pen as a huge sow squeals and angrily noses her young ones away from the trough so she can feed
book works on repairing the broken birdhouse when rachel enters
he uses a drawknife on a piece of x with some obvious expertise
eli is a fine carpenter
best in the district
he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago
and what happened to hochstetler
we had some lemonade and he left
a real fireball
book crosses to a workbench and selects another tool
you know carpentry
i did some carpentry summers when i was going to school
what else can you do
really annoyed i can whack people
im hell at whacking
whacking is not of much use on a farm
now hold on
theres a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job
im sure it is
she turns starts to go
then turns back eyeing his makeshift garb tonight ill let out those trousers for you
stifling a smile she goes
hold on book a beat then
eli is seated at the head of the table book opposite samuel and rachel
the table is piled high with an incredible amount of food
eli eyes book cagily waves his fork at him eat up book
whats the matter with your appetite
guess im not used to so much
snorts not used to hard work
thats what makes an appetite
book swallows that one
rachel intervenes eli john is a carpenter
conciliatory afterthought as well as being a fine policeman
well then maybe he can go to zooks barn raising eh
see how good a carpenter
book cant refuse the challenge
you may not be well enough
ill drink some more of stoltzfus tea
as rachel lamp in hand walks up to the barn
she looks in to find book tinkering with the battery hookup to the lapp buggy
he glances up as she enters hi
as she sets her lamp down near the one hes using
beat when will you be going
a few days
another beat as rachel watches him
book checking out the battery power hits the radio and suddenly from the twentieth century comes the sound of one of its major inventions rock and roll
it fills the barn but book turns up the volume a click more even and eyeing rachel starts moving with the beat
its his culture coming through loud and clear as incongruous as it all might seem with the tough philly cop decked out in amish
rachel cant help but laugh
sensing her response book sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight rachel alternately protesting and laughing
you like it
rachel confused protests no
you just stop but she doesnt really want to
book grins mock alarm next thing you know youll be off drinking beer and racing motorcycles
and it goes on
rachel alternately protesting and laughing
as eli suddenly appears
he glowers for an instant thunderstruck then bellows rachel
as book and rachels dancing comes to a sudden halt
both turn look at eli
rachel regards him level eyed without discernible alarm
book looking a bit sheepish goes over turns off the radio as in the dialect what is this
book hesitates then starts to say something its not her fault
i but he gets such a look from eli that he turns goes out
in the dialect how can this be
how can you do such a thing
is this plain
is this the ordnung
i have done nothing against the ordnung
in the dialect eh
rachel you bring this man to our house
with his gun of the hand
you bring fear to this house
fear of english with guns coming after
you bring blood and whispers of more blood
now english music
and you are dancing to english music
and you call this nothing
i have committed no sin
in english no sin
but rachel it does not look
in the dialect dont you know there has been talk
talk about you not him
talk about going to the bishop
about having you
that is idle talk
in english pleading do not make light of it rachel
they can do it
then i can not sit at table with you
i can not take a thing from your hand
i can not go with you to meeting
the old man almost breaks down as in the dialect rachel good rachel you must not go too far
rachel is annoyed also touched no doubt by the old mans plea but irked by his condescending tone
i am not a child
suddenly stern again you are acting like one
i will be the judge of that
fierce as a prophet no
they will be the judge of that
and so will i
if you shame me
blinking a tear now but meeting his gaze you shame yourself
and shaken but proud and erect she turns and walks out
carter sits schaeffer prowls
slowly letting silences grow before he strikes again with another softly snarled question or statement
you know where he is
youd lie to protect him
schaeffer snaps around glares at him
you admit youre lying
shakes head i admit i dont know where he is
youre the first one hell contact
sighing hes got my number
schaeffer stops stands in front of carter takes a deep breath
and is abruptly as he is capable of being the man of charm and gentlemanly reason
he even chuckles as he begins its funny
i know hes hiding somewhere with the amish i know it
a quick glance at carter can you imagine john book at a prayer meeting
our john book
schaeffer chuckles again looks hopefully again at carter
carter looks back stony eyed
schaeffer makes another abrupt shift in form
but still speaks softly
either youre a member of the club or you arent elton
he nods his head as tell me what you know
what i know paul is
nodding his head hes going to take you out
as book pauses by the barn door glances over his shoulder
with trace horse harnessed
samuel and eli loading provisions into the buggy standing down by the house
as he goes into the barn
book approaches lukes stall warily
and as he does so the temperamental mule reacting to form starts to skitter his hooves cracking against the walls of the stall
book starts to talk gently to the animal all right you nasty son of a bitch were going to be friends whether you like it or not
then summoning his resolve he carefully opens the stall gate
as luke eyes him balefully book reaches into his pocket brings out some lumps of sugar
you like sugar dont you for christs sake
finally keeping a mistrustful eye on book luke condescends to eat
book nods with satisfaction
rachel has entered the barn is watching book with a puzzled expression
book turns grins with some pride of accomplishment
won him over just like that
and but i hope you have a lot of sugar
then going eli is ready to go to zooks
just then luke skitters impatiently
book gives him a nervous look one last tentative pat as luke eyes him skeptically then closes the stall gate and turns to go later
its early morning as the amish buggies are arriving at the zook farm for a barn raising
in the b
we can see big stacks of lumber all around the construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun raising the main supports on the already laid foundation
elsewhere long tables have been set up and women are spreading them with cloths setting out big tanks of hot coffee and cold lemonade for the men as eli book
rachel and samuel step down book eyes the construction site
wait here til i find a gang you can work with
book glances around as even more buggies arrive and more workmen and their families climb out
eli appears with hochstetler in tow
hochstetlers broad face breaks into a grin book
good to see you
he pumps books hand with his usual vigor smiling a greeting and pleasantry to rachel
she looks on amused
hochstetler gives rachel a look and we realize that his showing up just now to appropriate book was no happenstance
and book realizes it as well
eli says youre a carpenter book
its been a while
come with me
we can always use a good carpenter
with that he throws a huge arm around books shoulder and ushers him away
rachel calls after them good luck
as they move off
your hole is healed then
gives him a look pretty much
hochstetler nods with satisfaction good
then you can go home
as the morning progresses book and hochstetler sawing and augering out heavy timbers on big sawhorses
theres an unmistakable atmosphere of competition between the two men which doesnt go entirely unnoticed by the half dozen or so other young men on the gang
or indeed by rachel in fact she seems without leaning on it too heavily to be measuring the two men as the morning progresses and she occasionally passes within proximity
eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with sheaves of hand drawn sketches under their arms supervising the construction
all around them the structure is rising with remarkable rapidity
rachel where shes helping the women set out the huge noon meal
other women are sitting on benches in the b
knitting or doing quiltwork
samuel where hes banging away with a hammer with a group of boys his own age
elsewhere we see little girls botching a hand clapping game played to german rhymes
the very elderly sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs in the sunlight looking on the old men kibitzing in german the women gossiping
of the barn raising with the noon sun high overhead
at least a hundred and fifty men are swarming over and about the barn framework
some aid the rafters some hauling lumber to the job others sawing hammering drilling joining planing and what all
so many that the barn seems almost to be rearing up before our very eyes
and there isnt a power tool in sight
as rachel crosses near the benches
we can see other women eyeing her whispering among themselves some tittering
rachel ignores them
she joins the stoutly amiable mrs
yoder from the funeral sequence earlier
the older woman is emptying a big pan of fried chicken into serving platters
she smiles obviously liking rachel
everyone has an idea about you and the english
all of them charitable im sure
hardly any of them
book and hochstetler astride the roofbeam studs holding them together prior to nailing them to the roof beam
they are therefore crotch to the mast and facing one another way out at the far end of the roof
suddenly as hochstetler raises his hammer the studs start to part threatening to de ball the both of them
hochstetler drops his hammer grabs both sides of the roof with incredible brute strength and literally pulls it back together
book stares at hochstetler with nothing short of awe
hochstetler straining and grinning looks to book nail it
and he does nail it while hochstetler grinning and holding looks on
the barn is done the workmen climbing down from the rafters
its late afternoon
his face is pale and covered with sweat
the exertion of the day has taken its toll
hes in danger of fainting and is some forty feet above the ground
but hes determined it wont happen determined that he wont fall nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help
hochstetler guesses the situation
he moves beside book claps an arm about him says nothing doesnt even look at book
from below someone tells them to hurry up
hochstetler shouts we admire our work
the moment passes for book and hes okay
hochstetler removes his supporting arm
book looks him in the eye nods his appreciation almost imperceptibly
hochstetler wants no thanks and book knows it
hochstetler gives him a resounding slap on the back and starts climbing down
the gathering has congregated to hear bishop tschantz offer up a blessing on the new barn
panning the faces as they listen to the heavy german words rolling out over the still evening air
book stands a little to one side of the amish
the prayers he cannot share with them
rachel is aware of this feels something of his emotion
she looks toward him then she too closes her eyes and drifts away from him into the soothing prayer
book stands outside listening to the night sounds
he turns walks up toward the porch
book takes a seat in a chair sighs looks toward the night sky
there is a sound but its a moment before he turns his eyes toward the door
samuel standing there in his nightshirt
as book leans forward in his chair
i want to say a thing
sitting up whats that sam
the boy hesitates holds for a time then suddenly darts across to book wraps his arms around him hugs him tightly
then breaks away turns and runs hack into the house leaving the door open behind him
looking after the boy genuinely moved
after a moment he speaks softly same to you sam
after another moment he gets up moves to close the door that samuel has left open behind him
from the lighted shadowed area outside the door
he comes to the door starts to close it then hesitates looks into see where the light is coming from
he looks down the corridor
the light is obviously coming from the kitchen
he speaks softly sam
book steps inside pulls the door shut behind him moves down the corridor toward the kitchen
where rachel dressed only in a plain cotton camisole is pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub
she replaces the pail on the stove turns and slips out of her camisole
naked she folds the garment across the back of a chair
then she pauses containing a startled intake of breath
the gleaming bottom of a large copper skillet hanging over the stove with other cookware we can see books image reflected there framed in the kitchen doorway
rachel hesitates for a moment and in that moment she makes a choice
slowly she turns to face him without shame meeting his eyes
and for a moment she attempts something a look a flash of eve
a lovely heartbreakingly innocent effort to become for an instant a woman of books world
as he stands in the doorway willing himself to leave unable to make it happen
and suddenly the moment has passed
rachel lowers her eyes picks up the camisole covers herself with it without putting it on looks away
tightening to him and
where rachel is scattering feed to the chickens
a beat then book approaches from behind her
a moment as she senses his presence
book watches as rachel begins to gather the eggs placing them in the fold of her apron
when he speaks he speaks softly and she pauses in her work
she goes very still but keeps her back to him
wed made love then i couldnt leave
she lowers her head slightly but remains turned away from him
book continues to stare at her
the lapp carriage on a winding lane
rachel is driving book sitting next to her
samuel is in the back looking out the rear window and not paying any attention to the adults
a beat then a large produce truck roars past them
its all book can do to keep from flinching
rachel stares straight ahead
book glances at her
maybe i ought to learn to drive this thing
rachel says nothing
beat pick myself up another useful skill
now rachel cant help but smile
she looks at him
we can see the lapp buggy approaching a rural intersection another buggy approaching at right angles
as rachel eyes the other buggy through the windshield
samuel who is that
samuel checks out the buggy
it looks like hochstetlers mare
as the lapp buggy passes the intersection and the hochstetler buggy swings in behind them
then the hochstetler buggy coming on at a faster clip starts to pass the lapp buggy
as rachel waves at the occupants of the other buggy daniel returns her greeting teasing her uh oh theyre leaving us behind
rachel gives him a look and
gives the reins a flick the race is on
hochstetler has a couple of older folk on board together with his young sister at first theyre not aware of the race until daniel can contain his excitement no longer
and gives his horse a couple of whoops
the buggies are neck and neck and the older people are not protesting loudly
its all book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off rachel but shes something of a horsewoman and finally she gains the edge and pulls ahead of hochstetler
to the cheers of samuel and book
its a saturday afternoon in the tourist season and theyre everywhere taking shots of anything amish
theres a rowdy young element amongst them who are making their presence fast and generally making a nuisance of themselves
book and rachel get out of the buggy
samuel stays inside the crowds make him nervous
a huge tourist bus billowing smoke pulls up nearby
rachel enters the store but before book can follow hes stopped by a tourist lady with an instamatic camera
she waggles the camera at him
ah you know
smiling lady if you take my picture ill rip your brassiere off and strangle you with it
the tourist lady stares at him in stunned disbelief her grin frozen on her face
then she begins to scuttle back from whence she came
rachel is browsing among the stocked shelves in the company of a young amish woman ellie beiler
rachel is carrying ellies tiny baby and the infant is getting as much attention as the shopping
book is standing at a wall pay phone in the b
we tighten to him and
lieutenant elton carter please
a beat then we hear the filtered voice of the philadelphia police department switchboard are you a member of the family
im a friend of his
last night sergeant carter was killed in the line of duty
book hangs up
his breathing is thrown out by the shock of the news and he takes a couple of deep breaths to regain control
he hesitates unsure of his next move
he makes to move away then he turns back finds more coins and dials a second number
schaeffers wife answers the phone she is momentarily shocked
she calls for her husband then makes polite conversation
how are you john
paul schaeffer appears slightly irritated at being called away from the saturday afternoon game
covering mouthpiece john book
ill take it in the study
schaeffer takes the phone
you can hang up dear
we hear the click of the other phone you made a mistake paul
you shouldnt have taken elton out
beat how bad did mac get you
we figured pretty bad
im going to live a long time
thats what i called to tell you
quickly johnny you might want to pass it along to mac
urgently listen to me johnny
youre out there all alone
were getting close
maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in ive already got something worked out
and be seeing you
book hangs up the phone and the dead click registers on schaeffer
book has gripped the phone so tightly that it takes a second to unclench his fist
then it takes something else to resist his first impulse which is to smash out at something
get it under control
deal rationally with the situation
he straightens his jacket wipes the sweat tears from his eyes turns and walks stiffly out of the saltzburg general store
book as rachel eyes him
she has noticed his changed mood but doesnt ask about it
he stares straight ahead oblivious to the surroundings of the street now crawling with tourists and traffic
the buggy turns into the side street
some hundred yards ahead another buggy is stopped in the middle of the road several youths gathered about it
a pickup truck is stopped facing the buggy
as rachel approaches the scene slowing down and finally stopping
rachel is at first puzzled then makes a small face looks at book
rachel puts a restraining hand on books arm
this happens from time to time
she senses him about to get out grips his arm tightly
its not our way john
well have nothing to do with violence
book shakes free gets out and slowly walks toward the
hochstetler and his family sit impassive ignoring various jeers and taunts from the english lads various jokes about them being dirty etc
one jabs an ice cream cone into hochstetlers forehead which leaves a curious white circle on his forehead
another fools about with the horse causing it to shy
a third notices the slow sure approach of john book
here comes another one
book stops his path blocked by the third youth
the youth flicks off books hat
quietly youre making a mistake
hochstetler calls from his buggy
everything is all right john
to the youth pick up the hat
the youth momentarily unsure something about books tone of voice
the youth does pick up the hat crumples it stamps on it and puts it back at a crazy angle on books head
a pause then book explodes
the kid never knew what hit him or where it came from he hits the road surface already unconscious
a second youth grabs book from behind
book is smashing into him spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions
hes hitting too hard too often
its schaeffer hes hitting
hochstetler is pulling him away rachel is there too
a crowd is gathering but as suddenly as it began its over
book shakes hochstetler off him straightens his hat and in a kind of daze begins walking past the scene in the direction of the lapp farm
the youths are picking up their wounded helping them back to their truck aided by none other than hochstetler
an old local addresses rachel
never seen anything like that in all my years
covering hes from
well them ohio amish sure must be different
addresses a gathering crow our lancaster brethren they just dont have that kind of fight in them
john lost control of himself
will be repentant
to rachel youre rachel lapp arent you
a second man calls from the pickup
kids nose is broken
well take him up the hospital
good day to you mrs
he shouts after her this aint good for the tourist trade you know
you tell that to your ohio cousin
but rachel is already steering past the scene and following the by now distant figure of john book
book comes out of the carpenters shop carrying the repaired birdhouse on its pole in one hand a shovel in the other
rachel is shepherding the milking cows toward the barn
you should not bother with that birdhouse
a beat if youre leaving tomorrow
im leaving tonight
and im going to need my clothes
and my gun
she nods looks away
looks back at him twice in glances
there is a moment when it appears she might either bark at him or begin to weep
when she does turn to him she speaks softly there was a time when i thought you might have stayed
then there was
there was a time when i would have welcomed it
after a beat i know
asking i was being foolish
and i was being unrealistic
even thinking about living this life
youre so sure of that
almost conceding it but
her voice rising a bit annoyed im not so sure of anything as you are john book
you could live this life if you wanted to bad enough
a beat just as i could live yours
almost groaning oh come on rachel
there is always a way
but you are such a
a glotzkopp you cannot see
youd rather go back to that city
now getting annoyed land
are you crazy
im no amishman and im no farmer
im a cop
thats what i know and thats what i do
what you do is take vengeance
which is a sin against heaven
thats your way not mine
thats gods way
well in the city of philadelphia god needs a little help
he has offended her immediately knows it but cant bring himself to make an instant apology
but hes chewing on it when she takes the moment unto herself
she pulls herself up speaks with great dignity i could never love a man who was so
he looks at her sad eyed his anger ebbing and gone realizing that hell never meet a finer woman
never even get close to such a one
he appears to start to speak but then does not
she turns moves away a few steps stops looks back at him
she holds for a moment blinking tears then speaks with some difficulty emotion welling in her words
the other night
when you saw me after my bath
i tried to look as i thought you would want a woman to look
but with a slight proud lift of chin i am sorry
that i did not
she holds for an instant then turns and walks off
looking after her
a face full of loss
eli is lighting the lamps
samuel reads a book at the kitchen table
rachel moves slowly to the sink and begins washing a few dishes
she looks out the window
close on her face a strange expression
the distant figure of book working on the birdhouse
close on rachels hands lifting items slowly up and of the water to the draining board where she places them carefully down
she shakes the water off her hands
close on her face still staring fixedly out the window
she speaks without turning around
eli would you see samuel to bed
the old man glances at her this is not their routine
in the rapidly fading light rachel walks slowly toward book
close on her face staring straight ahead toward book
angle on book close
he turns and watches rachels approach
the light now nearly gone the night sounds beginning as rachel reaches book and they embrace
book and rachel in a passionate embrace sink to the still warm earth and make love
establishing an all night cafe in the early hours of the morning
tightening to the bleakly lighted windows
a booth where schaeffer and mcelroy and fergie a lancaster county undersheriff and his sheriff an expansive politician type are seated
the undersheriff eyes schaeffer narrowly
the sheriff has a county map spread out on the table amid breakfast dishes pointing directions to schaeffer there
white oak road a couple of miles before it ties into two twenty two
we owe you one sheriff
my man holmes here put it together
fine officer chief
he spoke to the doctor at the hospital
undersheriff holmes and i have talked on the phone
nods at holmes good work
sure you dont want us to post some backup units
if we need any help well give you a shout
id like to slip in there quiet then get out before we attract any attention
as schaeffer and his men are climbing into their car
holmes and the sheriff watch after them
maybe ill take a drive over that way
let em be
its their dirty laundry
but holmes pauses to watch schaeffers car pull out
with the first light of dawn on the eastern horizon schaeffers car approaches along the lane pulls into the lapp driveway and comes to a halt
in the b
we can make out the farmhouse and outbuildings
hold as schaeffer mcelroy and fergie step out of the car
they break out short barreled twelve gauge pumps start toward camera spreading out as they turn up the long driveway
figures of ominous intent striding through the misty dawn
going with the trio of gunmen
mcelroy breath smoking in the chill eyes the terrain weird man
no fuckin electricity
what do you figure they plug all their shit into
they dont have any shit
where eli is getting into a heavy coat preparing to go out
the remains of the hearty morning breakfast are on the table
rachel is beginning the dishes
book and samuel are starting the morning milking
eli is preparing to extinguish the lamp when suddenly the kitchen door is kicked open and mcelroy and fergie weapons leveled burst in
eli reacts with angry shock as schaeffer enters rachel is for a moment terrified
to fergie outside to mac check out the rest of the house
he turns to eli who is standing in the middle of the room
schaeffer flashes his badge were police officers
were looking for a fugitive john book
hes living here
i have nothing to say to you
get out of my house
you speak english
now listen recovering no you listen
lady im here to help you
this man is very dangerous
an armed criminal
ingratiating hes got a gun hasnt he
you have no right here
mcelroy re enters
hes not in this building
to eli all right where is he
suddenly eli shouts its deafening
probably the loudest noise eli has ever made john book
mcelroy whips around smashes eli on the temple with the butt of his shotgun
eli crumples to the floor
rachel screams runs to eli
book and samuel in the milkhouse
theyve heard elis outcry
book moves to the window looks out
about halfway between the barn and the house
he turns from glancing back toward the house having heard elis shout and starts again toward the barn
gun at the ready
as book reacts
rachel kneeling next to eli wiping at his bruise with a damp cloth
schaeffer looks on
you might have killed him
to mcelroy find fergie check the barns
ill watch these two
mcelroy nods moves outside turns toward the barns
book still at the window samuel now beside him trying to get a look
is it them
turning mind racing its them sam
he bends to the boy takes him by the shoulders now sam listen to me and listen to me carefully
listen to me as you never listened before
interrupting are they going to kill you
listen to me sam
i want you to go across the new corn to stoltzfus
run as fast as you can
and stay there
what are you going to do
ill be all right
you just do as i say
he takes samuel by the hand leads him to the side door
he bends holds the boy close
dont let them hurt you
rising pushing samuel toward door i wont
as sam looks back fast as you can
sam turns takes off
fergie almost to the upper barn mcelroy well back and moving slowly circumspectly headed toward the lower barn
book at another window in the lower barn sees mcelroy heading for the milkhouse door
he cant see fergie
he turns crosses the cowpen area climbs an inner ladder leading to the upper barn
fergie at the door to the upper barn moving very cautiously gun up
he eases around the doorpost looks within
beyond book now at the top of the ladder we see fergie easing into the barn
book pulls himself up crawls behind the wall of the mule stalls opens gate eases in beside luke urgently whispering and patting the animal to calm him
he gets to the animals head crouches strokes lukes nose
the mules huge flanks quiver his nostrils and eyes widen but he makes no untoward sound
book closes the gate
he comes on warily muzzle first eyes darting
dollying with him as he reaches the first mules stall opens the gate
an edgy mule turns eyes him shuffles nervously
fergie backs off moves on
as he listens tenses hearing fergies feet in the fresh straw
book eases back alongside luke waits
as he approaches lukes stall reaches for the gate latch
as the gate swings open book shouts and gives luke a whack on the back
the mules pent up nerves and feral energy explode in an horrendous scream
bowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies open involuntarily firing suddenly finding himself under the lethal hooves of a twelve hundred pound beast
staggering backwards he screams fires again the load striking the mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into fergies head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun
in half like a matchstick
as he slips out of the stall ducks toward the rear of the barn
fallen skull smashed
and now the dying lukes legs buckle and he collapses atop fergie
mcelroy standing still shock eyed looking toward the sound of the shots
then starting slowly forward
on the porch of the house looking toward the barn
some distance from the barn samuels hearing the shots stops dead in his tracks
the sound of the shots still reverberating across the quiet fields
he hesitates then turns starts trotting back toward the barns
rachel has moved into the open kitchen door glances anxiously toward the barns
schaeffer pushes her back
get back in there
my son is out there
nobodys going to hurt your son
as mcelroy checking the safety on his twelve gauge steps into the barn
mcelroy flattens himself against the wall looks around fearfully
schaeffer staring toward the barn shouts what the hell happened
he listens hears nothing snorts starts toward the barn checking his gun not hurrying
eli now seated at the table holding a cloth to his head
rachel at a window peering out
schaeffer on the porch samuel running as fast as he can trips as he crosses a small muddy stream falls full length scrambles up runs on
mcelroy moving very cautiously comes around the mule stalls stops short stares off screen
where he lies half buried beneath the huge bulk of the mule his head crushed like an eggshell
as he moves on around fergie and the dead mule planting each foot as if he were walking in a mine field
standing in shadow at the back of the barn next to a hay mow
moving toward the center of the barn
as he starts to move even further back he nudges into a rope fastened to the wall behind him he looks at it looks up
it runs from where it is fastened to the wall straight up to the center roofbeam of the barn to a trolley fixed to a track that runs the length
of the roofbeam
attached to this trolley is a big hayfork paul krantz has one u shaped sharply pointed at each end of the u
the points hanging toward the floor
the thing weighs about eighty pounds and is suspended in place by the rope anchored at the wall next to book
keeping one eye on mcelroy he carefully begins to un tie the trip rope
moving out toward the center of the barn almost under the suspended hay fork
he stops short listens
then either spotting a moving shadow or hearing a sound he fires
his shot rattles off the side of a manure spreader
he shouts book you sneaky bastard i know youre here
come out and fight
samuel at the top of the barnyard stops at the sound of the shot wide eyed
he listens for an instant starts a step toward the barn then stops again looks to a large bell suspended in a cupola by one of the outbuildings
he moves quickly to the bell seizes the rope pulls
the bell clangs loudly sonorously
on the front porch looking around for the location of the sounding bell
he takes a step toward the barn the stops looks back toward the house
book watches as mcelroy starts to move again looking back toward the sounding of the bell
looking down we can see mcelroy almost directly beneath the hay fork
the bell sounding throughout
trip rope in hand
then shouting hey mac
and he lets go the trip rope
as he turns toward the sound of books voice
as it plummets down causing a ratcheting sound that fills the barn even drowns out the sound of the bell
eyes darting wildly looking up
plunging straight for him
diving to one side
thudding into the barn floor like a great trident fork
quivering there not a foot from mcelroys head
staring at the fork pop eyed
sprinting toward a ladder thrust up through an opening in the barn floor just in front of his parked car
spotting book coming up to one knee quick aiming firing
the shot smashes the windshield of the car
diving rolling slamming into the top of the ladder flailing down out of sight
firing again then again
emptying the gun cursing as he begins to reload gets to his feet starts toward the ladder
the bell still sounding outside
the hood of the car slowly as mcelroy wheels at the movement of the cars hood fires twice
the buckshot virtually blows the dashboard off
samuel ringing the bell
the bell rope is short and so is samuel and his feet go off the ground with every swing of the rockerarm
he hangs on grimly his black hat clinging to the back of his head his face set against the tears that move down his cheeks
comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn looking toward the sound of the bell but also looking back in glances toward the house to make sure rachel and eli
stay where they are
he still cant see samuel
as rachel starts off the porch takes a few steps
turning shouting you stay put
she is also unable to see samuel
moving out toward the barn rounding a corner
and there is samuel at the bellrope
he starts toward him
beyond samuel well out in the fields of the stoltzfus farm stotlzfus and others including hochstetler and his brothers are baling the first cutting of june hay
but the operation has come to a halt
all are looking in toward the lapp farm hearing the ringing of the bell the amish cry for help wondering hesitating
but now as we watch led by hochstetler they start in toward samuel
as schaeffer reaches samuel shouts cut that out
samuel looks at him keeps on pulling
schaeffer quickly crosses to him grabs him by the back of the neck tries to pull him off the bell rope
samuel hangs on grimly
schaeffer yanks hard succeeds in yanking samuel free shoves him roughly aside
then schaeffer turns fires a shotgun blast into the top of the bellrope
it still hangs by several threads so he fires again
the rope drops to the ground
schaeffer reloads turns to look at samuel just getting to his feet
when schaeffer recognizing samuel as the amish kid who saw mcelroy kill zenovich perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness right then and there
but a glance toward the oncoming amish gives him pause
he snarls at sam get down to the house and stay there
samuel gets to his feet turns trots off
already halfway out to the barn running to gather sam in her arms
then to lead him back toward the house
turning starting very slowly toward the barn
mcelroy at the top of the ladder looking down
then easing over placing his feet on the rungs
he stands below in a cowpen using the cows for cover
the cows stare balefully at him
a large goat nuzzles him hooks at him with its horns
book waits watches
visible to his knees as he eases down the ladder
he stops at every rung to scrape his shoes free of the cowshit covering the rungs
he turns now to a door at the back of the pen
he un hooks it pulls it open moves inside
he is now in a small passageway giving on to the entrance to a nearly empty silo
above the entrance a ladder interior rises to the top of the structure
book looks in and up
we should get the impression that books been here before expects what he sees
forty feet up a patch of blue sky through an open hatch
he steps through to the base of the ladder then ducks beyond it into the silo
there is about two feet of old silage covering the floor
he turns looks up the white walls
an inside ladder runs to the top
standing against the wall next to the entrance
obviously to be inserted as the silo is filled
now quickly he ducks back out through the entrance crosses to the door to the cowpen very cautiously peers out
mcelroy at the bottom of the ladder looking in the other direction toward the milkhouse
very carefully he shoves the cowpen door which opens outward into the cowpen
it begins to swing very slowly open
book immediately turns darts back into the silo
turning slowly toward the cowpen
then fires twice as his eye catches the motion of the swinging door
his shots blow half a row of elis precious tools off an adjacent wall
mcelroy reloads starts across toward the door
old eli at the sight of samuel rises from the table
rachel stands aside as the old man embraces samuel long and hard
she watches as he turns to the cupboard takes down the big family bible
he crosses to the table sets the book down places his hand on its pulls samuel to the table beside him
rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man helplessly then she rushes to where she hid books gun takes it down
her trembling hands take the bullets out of the coffee jar
she drops several as she tries to figure out how to open the chamber to load it
in the b
eli glances up sees what she is about
he rises and crosses to her
samuel watches from the table
fiercely no rachel
i have to help him
rachel somehow manages to open the chamber and begins to try to load the bullets
elis callused hand closes over hers halting the action it is not our way
bullets are already clattering to the floor from her trembling fingers as she raises her eyes to elis
a long beat as rachel looks at him
finally her fingers release the pistol and it clatters to the floor
she closes her eyes
samuel who has gotten up moved to a window watches eli and rachel silently
eli leads her to the table places her hands on the bible beneath his
they stand there and they pray
book finishes putting the kickboard into the entrance
moving among the cows stepping cautiously between the cowflops
the goat nudges him once then butts him rather firmly
mcelroy swats at him with the gun butt moves to the door
as he arrives he hears a noise very slight from the direction of the silo
he enters the passage way looks in toward the silo entrance he hesitates
another slight noise
he steps in to the base of the inner ladder looks up
the patch of blue sky forty feet up
he frowns reaches out grabs a rung
schaeffer easing toward the mule stalls mutters curses under his breath
then he rounds the corner of the first stall
and there is fergie with luke the mule on top of him
schaeffer stares blinks
moves on spotting a spent shotgun shell near the hayfork
book listening at the kickboard
sounds of feet shotgun rattling against metal rungs book moves to the ladder on his side starts silently up
climbing with difficulty shotgun clutched in one hand
he climbs up to the second kickboard pauses checks the distance to the floor starts upward again
the amish beginning to arrive
sam comes running pulls stoltzfus toward the door of the milkhouse as the other amish look at the shot shattered bellrope
rachel and eli come rapidly up the path toward the group
schaeffer finds another spent shotgun shell crosses to the ladder looks down
he sets his shotgun down takes out his service revolver starts down
book has reaches the third kickboard about thirty feet from the ground
he checks it turns the thumb screws that hold it in place places his hand on the handle moves to one side as best he can
hangs there listening
rattling up the other ladder approaching the third kickboard
listening tensely hearing mcelroy arrive on the other side of the kickboard
then deliberately book makes a fist raps on the board smartly once
he sets his feet leans back against the back wall of the ladder well brings the shotgun up puts the muzzle against the kickboard clicks off the safety
we hear with him the thump of the muzzle the click
and with marvelous speed book pulls the kickboard and drops it to the floor
mcelroy flash cut staring in stun eyed already falling forward having leaned his weight on the shotgun as book seizes the shotgun by the barrel pulls inward
as mcelroy pitches forward through the opening screams and grabs as he plunges past book
the shotgun fires as mcelroy manages to hold onto book and both men plunge thirty feet to the bottom of the silo
he falls almost straight down lands on his back lies stunned
his forward motion has carried him across the silo
his head bounds off the white brick wall about five feet up
and he falls in a heap blood gushing from his head as
blinking groaning just beginning to stir
and suddenly into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it
the muzzle is placed firmly against books temple
schaeffer holding the pistol
he cocks the pistol tenses as if to fire and he is actually about to
when there is a sound behind him
he snaps around
old stoltzfus and samuel standing in the kickboard opening schaeffer having kicked the kickboard in when he heard the shot from within the silo
they stand solemnly looking on as he eases the hammer down on this pistol speaks softly okay johnny
on your feet
as book struggles to his feet schaeffer holding the pistol tight to books head
book turns sees samuel and stoltzfus blinks
schaeffer shoves book toward the opening
as book moves toward samuel he speaks quietly its okay sam
as book and mcelroy move out of the silo down the passageway toward the milkhouse stoltzfus and sam after a glance in at the inert mcelroy follow and
as first stoltzfus and samuel then book and schaeffer emerge into the barnyard
schaeffer has the muzzle of his pistol pressed firmly against books throat just below his jaw
schaeffer pulls up frowning hold it
the amishmen gathered the stoltzfus family the hochstetler brothers et al
all staring hard at schaeffer and book
from a high wide angle the final scene is played out
schaeffer and book now moving again slowly up the drive the amish following along closely on both sides
as schaeffer prods book forward warily eyeing the amish
get back you people
prodding keep moving johnny
book takes a couple of steps further then abruptly stops
the amish stand about close staring no one moving
book now slowly turns his head looks at schaeffer
youre going to have to do it right here schaeffer
dont try me johnny
eli steps forward bloody cloth held to his head
will you kill us all then
as schaeffers eyes waver between book and eli book slowly turns until he is facing schaeffer
the gun now leveled and almost pressing against books chest
book locks eyes with schaeffer
quietly its all over paul
or you die right here
books right hand snakes out grabs schaeffer by the gunhand wrist twists viciously schaeffer screams in pain the gun falls out of his hand he starts to his knees under
the force of books grip
as book bends picks up the pistol releases schaeffer pushes him away
schaeffer staggers against hochstetler who partly to keep him from falling and partly it appears to congratulate him on his surrender wraps one brawny arm around schaeffers shoulders gives him
a short approving nod
holds schaeffer as turning looking into the crowd finding rachel
their gazes meet hold for a long moment
in the eyes of both we read resignation
whatever there was between them has been terribly damaged
it is almost certainly over for them too
high shot holding the moment
the door opens and book steps out looking somehow strange in his working suit
he looks about him sees samuel down by the pond
he eases down beside samuel
they both stare into the pond
are you really ever coming back
got to sam
you and i are going to a courthouse together put some people behind bars
have you got your gun on now
sure have sam
book takes him in his arms holds him
book opens the door of the car turns to find rachel standing there with his amish hat in hand
i want you to take this
to remember by
wheres my baggy pants
whenever you want them
he wants to kiss her but does not
their eyes say it all
eli has a final word shouting from the porch
you be careful john book
out among them english
book gets quickly into the car
as book drives he sees an open buggy coming down the hill toward the farm he slows as he passes its daniel hochstetler
a long beat and as they pass hochstetler gives book an expansive tip of his hat
book turns to look back at his rival a doubt in his eyes
