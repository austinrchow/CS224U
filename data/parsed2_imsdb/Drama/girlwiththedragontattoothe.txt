written by steven zaillian a christmas card vista is spoiled by a black line of railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a scar pointing north to icy desolation
a phone rings an elderly man who lives alone in this rustic cabin a retired policeman regards the phone both expecting and dreading the call
he picks up the receiver
what kind is it
i dont know
and the frame
same as last time
henrik vanger at even older than morell listens to the silence from his end of the line in a wood paneled room as baronial as the policemans was spartan
i cant take it anymore
im sorry henrik
theres nothing more to say
vanger sets the receiver down and regards a dried white flower in a x frame resting on the brown paper it was wrapped and mailed in
its somehow ominous like the dark storm clouds that now burst outside
mikael blomkvist s regards the gauntlet of reporters hell have to pass to get out of the building
as he strides toward them microphones and cameras swing in his direction
without stopping what is this the media event of the year
dont try to play it down mikael it wont work
dont try to play it up that wont either
feeling a bit like hes fleeing the scene of a crime which in a way he is blomkvist steps outside opening his umbrella
a couple of the reporters come out after him will you appeal
ill appeal to you viggo find a real story to cover
he hurries off in the rain
financial journalist mikael blomkvist was found guilty today on counts of aggravated libel against financier hans erik wennerstrom
at a table with a pre made sandwich and cup of coffee and a long court judgement blomkvist watches himself fleeing the reporters on the cafes tv
hes the only one there who watches it no one else is interested which only makes it worse
in an article published earlier this year blomkvist claimed wennerstrom founder and president of the wennerstrom group used state funds intended for industrial development in poland for an arms deal
with the right wing ustashe in croatia
the report cuts to a shot of wennerstrom outside the courthouse in an armani suit surrounded by his legal team confidently addressing the reporters i have nothing against mr
hes a good journalist who i dont believe is guided by malice
but what he wrote was inaccurate and inaccuracies cant go unanswered
he all journalists have to accept like the rest of us actions have consequences
done with his sandwich blomkvist goes to the counter
and a lighter
he comes out tamping the pack
extracts a cigarette
tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin
flicks at the lighter but cant get it to fire in the wind and rain
hunches his body around it coaxes it to life
blomkvist was ordered to pay thousand ske in damages and all court costs which could be significantly more
he takes a long drag that dizzies him
a wonderful feeling
he regards the trash bin
fishes around it finds the pack puts it in his coat pocket
he comes through past christmas decorations and a mostly young staff
they try not to regard him as a dead man walking but arent entirely successful
he enters the editors office
where you been
erika berger is about blomkvists age and like the ikea furniture sends a mixed message a feminist in a mini skirt
he sits exhausted and depressed in a cheap poang chair
i told them no statement until weve read the judgment in its entirety
everyone whos ever wanted to see you humiliated
youve been on the phone all day then
im as much to blame for this as you
you wrote it
i read it
i ran it
not the same
our credibility isnt dead mikael
they regard each other in another silence
i feel like climbing under a duvet and sleeping for a week
he thinks about it
shakes his head no
i already called greger and told him i wouldnt be home tonight
a motorcycle dives down a driveway that burrows under a three story building
dragan armansky s who looks more like a boss of a new jersey crime family than ceo of a high tech security firm sits behind his desk waiting with an
its possible we could wait forever
you called her i thought
you spoke to her
im afraid that doesnt mean much
i dont understand
no one here likes her
so its better if she works at home
but you told her i wanted to meet her
but ive told her many more times i prefer her not to meet clients
the figure from the motorcycle crosses the lobby
from behind we cant see him her well but can see wary looks from others emerging from and getting into the elevator
but you like her
shes one of the best investigators i have
as you saw from her report the report on armanskys desk is pages long
insert printed on its cover mikael blomkvist a case number and smaller its author lisbeth salander
im concerned you wont like her
in what way
in every way
the black clad figure from behind again strides past coworkers who look away
armansky breathes a defeated sigh taps the intercom button twice to say okay let her in
lisbeth salander walks in a small pale anorexic looking waif in her early s
short black dyed hair pierced eyelid tattoo of a wasp on her neck probably several more under her black leather jacket black t shirt black jeans black caterpillar boots
frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his initial reaction to her
this isnt punk fashion
this is someone saying stay the fuck away from me
how do you do
she doesnt shake frodes hand but does address him something wrong with the report
it seems quite thorough
theres a wealth of data here
but im also interested to know whats not in it
theres nothing not in it
your opinion of him isnt
im not paid to give my opinion
so you dont have one
salander sends armansky a weary look
his look back begs her not to say anything unpleasant
eventually hes clean
in my opinion
hes excuse me
hes who he presents himself to be
in his business thats an asset
theres less in his asset column after his conviction today
he made a fool of himself with that
if it happened that way
frode looks at armansky
whats that supposed to mean
if he made up the story thats out of character
so is giving up without a fight
people dont do things that are out of character
are you saying he was set up
that wasnt part of my assignment
and apparently she has no opinion on it either
youre quite right he made a fool of himself professionally
how big of a fool did he make of himself financially
the judgement will just about empty his savings
this seems to please frode more than anything else that has been said and salander sees it
may i go
your report is light in another area
his personal life
anything you chose not to include
nothing that warranted inclusion
im not sure if that means yes or no
i think what ms
salander means and i agree is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy even when theyre being investigated
not in this case
i have to know if theres anything about him i might find unsavory even if she doesnt
armanskys look to her at once apologizes for frode and encourages her to speak
she finally relents but puts no more spin on it than any other piece of raw data hes had a long sexual relationship with his co editor
it wrecked his marriage but not hers
her husband accepts it
sometimes she sleeps at blomkvists sometimes at home
frode thinks about that perhaps imagining how much simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement
you were right not to include that
please think before you say no
i dont want to be surprised by something later
salander offers nothing more
in the personal department
pause he likes sandwiches
blomkvist isnt sentimental but does have a few framed snapshots his daughter his sister and one with erika in their s in which hes wearing a black leather jacket
she wakes up alone in his bed
pads to the darkened living room to find him typing on his laptop a half eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it
usually when i wake up in a cold bed its at home
what are you doing
writing the press release
saying youre taking over as publisher
youre sorry for any nuisance wennerstrom was caused
i cant be reached for comment
youre giving up
just taking a few steps aside
this makes me sick
salander sits alone at a table waiting for someone with a coffee and a gift haphazardly wrapped with a christmas bow the price tag still on it a paperback book
my memorable games by bobby fischer
she notices the price tag is still on it
peels it off
dials a call on her cell
hangs up when it goes to voice mail
she knocks on a door
hears classical music playing softly inside but no one answers
she tries the door
the gift in hand she pushes it open
she comes into an apartment which looks like it could belong to a professor
sees a chess piece on the floor
then a trail of them that lead her to an overturned chess table and next to it a body
the gash on the old mans head could have been caused by a fall into the corner of the table or from a blow to it
she quickly tries to determine if hes breathing
calls for an ambulance
its doubtful theres a stranger christmas gathering going on anywhere in the world
standing around with eggnog are
blomkvist his teenage daughter pernilla his sister annika and her italian husband erika and her weirdly understanding artist husband greger whose arm is around her waist a few other friends
and perhaps lovers
you needed a better attorney
you needed your sister
as she hoped
never a good idea mixing family and business
and i still would have lost
did you have
anything on him
i had a lot
it just wasnt any good
it wasnt even about mikael
it was wennerstrom sending a message to the press as a whole and the fsa dont ask questions
blomkvists daughter seems concerned for him
im fine nilla
you dont have to worry about me
about all that money
outside the icu salander sits on the floor like a dog who wont leave the spot its master told it to wait
for the first time since weve met her she looks vulnerable
the doors swing open
a doctor steps out
salander gets up to hear his report youre mr
he doesnt have a daughter
the doctor isnt sure then if he should talk to her
not allowed to go inside she peers through glass at palmgren who is unaware of her or the nurse attending him or even himself
a spiderweb of tubes emerge from his neck and wrists oxygen tubes from his nostrils
hes had severe cerebral hemorrhaging
either from the fall itself or a stroke that led to the fall
his blood pressure is still high
im hopeful hell regain consciousness but thats not assured
and its possible if he does there will be neurological damage
theyre around the dinner table now passing platters around
blomkvist notices his daughters head is bowed in silent prayer
what are you doing
pause youre not serious
dragon tattoo final sz i dont want to talk about it since i know you wont approve
of she doesnt say nilla
light of life
light of what
she doesnt repeat it what is that
you think its all senseless but it isnt
its more natural to believe in something than not to
she begins eating
blomkvist stares at her feeling a little sick
a cell phone rings
no one can tell as you never can whose it is and so all pull them out
looking back at his daughter with some concern he steps away to take the call
forgive me for intruding on your christmas
my name is dirch frode
im an attorney
i represent henrik vanger
perhaps youve heard of him of course
hed like to speak to you about a private matter
you know youre calling at an awkward time
im about to sit down to christmas dinner myself
thats not what i mean
youre referring to your recent legal trouble
that has provided mr
vanger with some entertainment
he doesnt care for wennerstrom either
frode in his polite deliberate way is reeling blomkvist in like a perch
have him call me
hed like to meet in person if thats okay
hes much too old to make a trip to stockholm mr
if youd be so kind as to consider
blomkvist isnt sure what to do or say
hedestad is lovely in winter
like a christmas card
salander rides a crowded underground train but feels even more cut off from the people around her than usual completely alone
a passenger train barely visible in a severe snowstorm makes its way north
this is no christmas card
blomkvist stares out at the bleak northern landscape
blomkivist disembarks to find frode who he can only assume is frode beyond a veil of snow waving to him from outside a mercedes
unlike blomkvist hes dressed for this god awful weather in a fur collared topcoat
frodes mercedes comes across a long bridge linking the old industrial town to a rocky island
first time in hedestad
and last im sure
its lovely in the spring
you said it was lovely in winter
this is unseasonable
ill be on the train back to stockholm
unless we get snowed in
youll be home tonight if thats what you wish
the car comes up a long bare tree lined drive leading to a stately manor
as frode and blomkvist climb out a distant gunshot echoes but neither frode nor the old man who appears at the front door of the manor pays it any attention
just someone hunting
it is warm inside
there are fires in the fireplaces
and vanger himself is warm in nature yet speaks quickly as they come through the house thank you for coming way out here
anna take mr
blomkvists insufficient coat
would you like to freshen up
well be having dinner later
for now hot tea is waiting
unless youd like a drink instead
what would you like
blomkvist would like to be on the train back to stockholm
i cant stay for dinner
vanger looks thoroughly disappointed
i guess id better be quick then
thank you dirch
mikael this way
tea service and pastries on a coffee table separate blomkvist from vanger whose elderly frame is in danger of being swallowed up by a wing back chair
what do you know about me
that you used to run one of the biggest industrial firms in the country
there are framed black and white photographs on a wall factories and trains figuring into all of them
my grandfather forged the tracks the train will take you home on and most of the other pre state owned rail lines
we stitched this country together
we made the steel and milled the lumber that built modern sweden
pause you know what our most profitable product now is
blomkvist doesnt fertilizer
blomkvist imagines hes meant to offer a wistful shrug
im not obsessed with the declining health of the company but i am with the settling of accounts and the clock is ticking
i need your help
officially assisting me with my memoirs
but what youd really be doing is solving a mystery
and youd do that by doing what you do so well this recent legal mishap of yours notwithstanding
youd be investigating thieves misers bullies and malcontents the most detestable collection of people youll ever meet

the children of the thieves misers bullies and incompetents play on a beach
a shutter blinks freezing a year old girl in foreground in black and white this is harriet
the granddaughter of my brother richard
the same photograph of harriet in a photo album vanger shows blomkvist
richard who i may as well start with to get it out of the way was a nazi of the first order joining the nationalist socialist freedom league when he
a page in the album turns to reveal a photo of a young man in a uniform with a nazi pin
isnt it interesting how fascists always steal the word freedom
blomkvist checks his watch the
anyway richard died a martyr to the nazi cause in missed all the real excitement but not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife margareta and their son gottfried
we see photos of gottfried a handsome young man
now gottfried harriets father was what people used to call a good time charlie
theyre still called that
insert close on a photo of gottfried
he was a charmer a ladies man a drunk
in other words a born salesman which is what he did for the company traveling around taking clients out to dinner and so on
someone has to do it
anyway he died in
here on the island
a studio photo gottfried with his wife and two children
his wife isabella who was pretty much useless before as a parent became even more so after his death which is when i began looking after their children martin who
runs vanger industries now that im retired and harriet
a photo of a much younger vanger and year old harriet
she was bright and curious a winning combination in any person
vanger nods as he regards the photo
something happened to her
vanger nods again is silent for several moments
someone in the family murdered harriet and for the last forty years has been trying to drive me insane
the train leaves the station without blomkvist
anna gathers the cups and leaves with the tea tray
it was september st
three generations of vangers dot the grounds
my brothers along with their wives children and grandchildren had gathered here for our loathsome annual board meeting and dinner
it was also the day the yacht club held its autumn parade
and we see the parade and among the spectators lining the towns main street harriet with other teenage girls
harriet and a couple of school friends had gone into town to watch it
she returned a little after two oclock
a clock in the room reads
vanger and a few family members sip afternoon cocktails
she came to the parlor
she asked if she could talk to me
i honestly dont remember what i was doing that i thought was more important but i told her to give me a few minutes
he returns to the others in the room
but in a few minutes before i could go upstairs to talk to her something else occurred
a car and a fuel truck both going too fast collide on the bridge
the truck rolls onto its side crushing the car and spewing gasoline
the accident had nothing to do with harriet and everything
vanger and the others react to the noise of the crash
out the large window they can see the bridge and many of those on the grounds trotting down to get a closer look
it was chaos as everyone dropped what they were doing
people and vehicles converge on both sides of the bridge
police an ambulance fire brigade reporter photographer and onlookers quickly arrived from town as those of us on the island the family hurried to the bridge from our side
the truck driver has managed to climb out of his cab but the other motorist is trapped
the driver of the car a mr
aronsson was pinned and severely injured
all we could do was try to pry him out with our hands since metal tools could spark
a local newspaper photographer and another man snap pictures as vanger and others try without success to pry the injured driver from his car
as the chaos ensues about twenty minutes after the crash harriet was in the kitchen
anna herself saw her
anna glances to harriet as she comes in then back out the window to the bridge
harriet passes a clock that reads steps outside walks toward the woods
as the sun sets vanger and the others on the bridge make progress extracting the driver from the car
a young man coming from the town side takes off his jacket to help
we finally got poor aronsson out of his car and off to the hospital and those of us on our side drifted back to the house
the family has assembled at a long dining table
the sun was down the excitement over we sat down to dinner
thats when i noticed harriet wasnt there
vanger considers an empty chair as everyone else including the young man from the bridge his jacket draped on his chair passes platters of food around
and she wasnt there the next morning
or the next
or the next forty years
vanger has the same look of concern on his face now as he leads blomkvist up some stairs
what was she going to tell me
why didnt i make time for her
why didnt i listen
she couldnt have run away
not without being seen
the crews continue their work under lights
firemen stayed on the bridge all night pumping out the gasoline
and no one swam across or took a row boat
all of them were still tied up on this side sunday
believe me we checked
she couldnt have fallen and drowned
the currents arent strong here
anything that falls into the water turns up nearby
like her father
his body didnt drift more than ten meters when he drowned the year before
vangers pauses at a landing to steady himself and his labored breathing
someone killed her mr
someone on the island that day
someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday
he unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a wall
these were from her
and on another wall forty similarly framed flowers these from her killer
blomkvist regards the forty
who knows about these
me the police the murderer
and now you
its raining as an elegantly dressed woman slows before a luxurious apartment building
salander approaches from the other direction
passing she notes the four number tones the woman keys in the code lock
the door buzzes open and the woman disappears inside
salander doubles back and keys the same four number tones in the milton security lock
antique elevator cage whose cables pull the woman upstairs
salander comes to an unlocked service door and takes stairs to a basement machine room
examines tangles of phone lines meters wi fi routers
photographs them with a digital camera
she climbs the stairs back up to the foyer
the front door buzzes and a man in a suit on the sidewalk pushes it open sees her holds it wide enough for her to pass
the man is a driver bodyguard
he continues to hold the door for his employer who now emerges from the back of an idling car and crosses to it in the rain
the rain here is icier and more punishing
when the police investigation petered out i kept at it
theyre eating dinner now in the dining room
studying their reports and interviews all the information there was and its a lot
ive spent half my life examining the events of a single day
and for all that hes no closer to the truth
i understand your frustration
but what youre asking me to do is a waste of money
we havent discussed your fee
we dont need to
i cant find something you havent been able to in forty years
you dont know that
you have a very keen investigative mind
blomkvist wonders why he ever agreed to come here as vanger refills his wine glass
heres what i propose you come stay on the island
i have a nice little cottage by the water you can use
you study the material i give you
you find something ive missed or you dont
you want me to set aside my life and career for something thats a complete waste of time
think of it as a well deserved vacation
a way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now
nothing from blomkvist as for compensation ill pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes
ill quadruple it if you solve the mystery
vanger im not done
ill throw in one more thing even though youre a terrible negotiator
its what you want more than anything else and it cant be bought at any price
ill give it to you
hans erik wennerstrom
he pushes toward blomkvist a plate the carcass of the fresh killed and cooked duck theyve been eating
it and the mention of wennerstroms name clouds at least for a moment blomkvists memory of the train he missed
he began his career working for me
and ive followed it with interest shall we say ever since
you were right about him
you just couldnt prove it
salander climbs a flight of stairs in a building that couldnt be more different than wennerstroms
knocks on a door waits listens to some dead bolts unlocking
it opens but remains impassable by a figure weighing over pounds
he offers her no greeting
fades back into the shadows of his dark apartment
would you like to sit
i could possibly clear a place if necessary
its hard to imagine how he or anyone might accomplish that
the place is like a junkyard
even the unmade bed is covered with stuff
did you make it
have you something for me
she takes some cash from a pocket hands it to him
he counts it and is unimpressed with its total
im on welfare i dont administer it
this isnt enough
i had to pay three months back rent and eat a little bit
its all i have right now
i find that so poignant
so much so that he does nothing more than look at her
she reaches to take the money back but he pockets it and moves across the dark room to a work table where high end computers fight for space with debris
finds and gives her a small homemade electronic box which she turns over in her hands
while its clear both these people are deficient in behavior that governs polite society its hard to tell which lacks it more
no thank you
erika first to arrive this morning or so she thinks comes through the empty offices with a waynes coffee to go cup but blomkvist is already there packing supplies from
his desk books from his shelf
a second suitcase presumably full of clothes sits on the floor
you cant be serious he zips the suitcase with the supplies in it closed and gathers the rest
were in our worst crisis ever and youre writing a memoir
you fired me i need something to do
you fired you i need you here not the north pole
you know what this is going to look like
like ive been gutted
like im running away
they cross through the building he with his cases she with her coffee cup
wennerstrom wants to see me waving a white flag not a red one
and the more it looks like theres a problem between you and me the more itll satisfy him
there is a problem between us
he wont be satisfied until he shuts us down and youre leaving me to fight him alone
he kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a statue and steps outside
its four hours by train
its not the north pole
the depot thermometer reads
blomkvist disembarks with two suitcases
this time frode isnt there to meet him
he struggles with his luggage through the snow to a taxi stand
as a taxi passes a gas station by the bridge blomkvist regards the middle eastern drivers eyes which regard him in the rear view mirror
think this snows going to let up anytime soon
this is the north pole
the taxi deposits blomkvist outside a cottage
from here he can see vangers manor and couple other houses
the taxi drives off and disappears into the snow
pile of wood
a realtor would call it cozy
in truth its just tiny and freezing cold
puts clothes in a wardrobe sets out books note pads pens cds a cd player his laptop and a small printer
he flips open his cell phone to make a call
gets no reception bars
hears a faint plaintive cry and traces it to a window beyond which on the sill outside stands a cat peering in
he opens the door and the cat heads straight for the kitchenette
then looks at him
he opens the old fridge
he comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone out in front of him like a dowser divining ground water
moves around trying to get a signal
he purchases milk butter a loaf of sliced bread some packaged lunch meats and a few cans of cat food
he walks along the street through wind whipping snow cradling the grocery bag cell out in front of him again
any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever there are no cell towers anywhere around here
grocery bag at his feet he dials a call with fingers he can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the end of the bridge
it goes to erikas voice mail
its fucking cold and im on a pay phone
if you tried to call the reception sucks and if you tried to email theres none of that either so so im here and i cant even speak its so
he hangs up open the same pack of cigarettes from before
eighteen in there
struggles to get one lit in the wind and snow hurries off toward the bridge
as the cat laps at milk on a plate blomkvist tries to get a fire going using pages ripped from a book
its a struggle hes going to lose hes no boy scout
salander appears and keys in the four lock tones
in the machine room again she pulls one cable away from the others and wires to it to plagues electronic box
the bell in the church tower clangs but its a knock that draws blomkvist awake
having forgotten where he is he regards the cat sleeping with him then the room and groans
he pads to the door in the freezing cold
opens it to find a rugged older man on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes
as gunner expertly builds a fire in the fireplace for him blomkvist works at unpacking the boxes documents fat police reports notebooks folders photo albums
youre an author
im writing a biography of mr
nilsson nods but isnt sure he believes it
maybe he took a look inside the boxes before he brought them down
i saw you on television
bit of trouble i guess
blomkvist nods and hopes thats enough to put an end to the subject
no jail time though
cost you a lot of money though yeah
blomkvist shares his annoyance with the cat
nilsson dusts himself off satisfied with the fire hes made
vanger has ventured outside to show blomkvist around the estate
smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold grey skies weather for which blomkvist unlike the old man is inadequately dressed
the island is owned by my family
your closest neighbor is my brother harald another nazi if you can believe
two in the family
hes detestable to put it nicely but youll probably never see him
hes a recluse
he was there that day
indeed he was
vangers look to blomkvist adds so consider him a suspect
he indicates another house on the grounds thats his daughter cecilias house
they dont speak
does anyone speak to anyone on this island
actually isabella harriets mother who lives there points she speaks to harald which is one of reasons i dont speak to her
points cecilias brother birger lives there
who doesnt he speak to
not that youd want him to
he can be as unpleasant as harald
im quickly losing track whos who
oh how youll wish were it always so
soon youll know us all only too well with my apologies
points out there is my nephew martins house harriets brother
its a modern house lots of glass out on the point
who speaks to him
i speak to him
he runs the company now as i think i told you
they hear a distant rifle crack and echo
it startles blomkvist a bit but not vanger
someone shooting their dinner
i just met him
he was when harriet disappeared
old enough blomkvist gathers to be considered a suspect
vanger points off he lives over there
shivering in the cold blomkvist turns
and you live here
for a moment vanger isnt sure what blomkvist means
then he is and is pleased by it
yes youre right
the man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list
a nurse takes a tray away leaving salander alone with palmgren separated by the chess table they wont playing a game on
she wipes his mouth with her sleeve
i got a call from social welfare
ive been assigned a new guardian
its unlikely he understands what she has said
its unlikely he even knows shes there
tacked to a wall a map of the island on which blomkvist has written the names of the living vanger family members and staff in the approximate locations of their
next to it x cards and photos a vanger family tree which doubles as a suspects list
on some of the cards is the word deceased

refills a coffee cup

id like to see the girls room
its down the hall

her mother is

slender overdressed and smoking a sobranie she immediately strikes morell as a woman as venomous as she is beautiful

he leafs through this
i want to speak to everyone here
thatll take all night so you might want someone to put some coffee on
what about the search
first thing in the morning
we should do it now
she could be hurt out there
vanger is either a good actor or has nothing to hide
i beg you

somehow he knows theyre never going to find her
the fact that i never found a body didnt surprise me

the same face forty years older the man who spoke to vanger on the phone about the dried flowers now speaks with blomkvist as he scrapes out the bowl of
but i also couldnt find a motive
was it spontaneous
was it planned
did she know something someone wished she didnt
was it about business
she was sixteen
and very bright
henrik told me he could easily imagine her running the business someday which would mean someone else wouldnt
she was with some friends that day
at a parade
you must have talked to them
she told them she wasnt feeling well
she left early
but they also said she kept secrets from them too
the main thing i learned talking to them for hours is that teenage girls are complicated
i have one
so you know
blomkvist does indeed did you bring the last gift henrik received
its at the national forensic lab
i can tell you what their report will say now its a flower common to europe
all of them are
he lights the pipe
blomkvist watches the tobacco glow
i wanted to ask you about this
he produces an old address book from his jacket pocket
of course morell has seen it before and handles it delicately
the decades have dried out its pages
dragon tattoo final sz she received this from henrik the christmas before
i studied it more times than i can say
i know every page of it
its the last page im curious about
as was i
the only names not alphabetized
morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns to that last page
on it in neat handwriting magda sara r
mari theyre local hedestad phone numbers
the first belonged to a woman named margot whose mother was magda who claimed she didnt know harriet
the fourth r
belonged to rosemarie larsson an elderly woman who died a few years before
the other three were unconnected in any way that i could find
he hands the address book back
it and everything else about the case clearly trouble him still
ive reminded you of things youd rather forget
i cant forget it
its my rebecka case
blomkvist isnt sure what that means
every policeman has at least one unsolved case
back then it was old torstensson
year after year he kept returning to one taking out the files uselessly studying them
as young men we had to laugh
was this also a missing girl case
no thats not why i mention it
the rebecka case is something that happened before harriet was born
im talking about the soul of a policeman
poor torstensson could never solve it and could never let it go
and neither can poor morell with his harriet case
an unexciting social welfare building
as a man behind a desk reviews a thick file salander reviews him about spends money on suits thinking that might disguise his public servant status no wedding ring typical
creep as far as shes concerned
i was told he had a stroke of some kind
nothing from salander terrible
it is but she can tell he couldnt care less
he leafs through her file what exactly do you do at this security company
make coffee and sort mail
but not full time
not even part time consistently
they somehow got along without coffee or mail in july and august
nothing from her
how much do you earn there
how much is your rent
dragon tattoo final sz i pay my rent
whens the last time you were late
do you think that ring in your eyelid makes you attractive
salander whos had to suffer insufferable officials all her life doesnt dignify the question with an answer
heres the problem
there a discrepancy between the obligation of mr
palmgrens guardianship and the management of your finances
it isnt a discrepancy or a problem
it was clear to him i could manage my own finances
but thats not clear to me
im not a child
looks at her too long but you were
and between then and now indicating the files two years in the locked ward at st
stephens for violent aggression failure to adapt to four foster homes and seven schools arrested twice for intoxication twice for narcotics use and most recently for assault a bottle smashed
into a mans face
you may have conned mr
palmgren into thinking youve improved but looking at this the file not to mention how youre looking at me now i can see you havent
so the good old mr palmgren days are over
starting now youll be given a monthly allowance
youll provide me with receipts for your expenses
if the numbers dont balance ill have to assume the difference is going to drugs
ive been on my own since i was twelve
youve been a persistent burden to the state since you were twelve
she wont look at him any more not that theres anything even remotely interesting to see if she did
please look at me
because this is important
in a way that says id like to kill you
this behavior youre displaying right now is elaborately documented here in the file so it would come as a shock to no one if i chose an alternative to the
lenient arrangement i just outlined
is that what youre saying with your silence
youd prefer institutionalization
salander steps into the elevator hits the down button
as the doors close martins house didnt look so far away but the road blomkvist has to climb to reach it and the fact he like all writers is out
of shape taxes him
a car driven by an attractive woman in her s pulls alongside him
he manages a nod were going to the same place
martin wearing an apron opens the door to find both his dinner guests on the porch
i found him at deaths door halfway up the hill
im afraid im a bit out of shape
no its a climb for anyone
i shouldve warned you
come on in
blomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in martins hand
the place is far cry from vangers manor
martin liv and blomkvist work on the dinner martin has prepared
soft jazz music issues from somewhere
i used to work in the companys petrochemical division in goteborg
when it was sold i went with it
a dark day
i live in hong kong now but come back to stockholm for family events and when i do i drive up to spend a couple days with martin
she comes for the moose steak
is that what this is
they all glance away to a sound a soft strange wailing wind
martin drains the last of a bottle of wine in blomkvists glass and gets up
you like this one or would you like to try something else
that ones good
martin heads off to the kitchen
blomkvist and liv left with each other seem unsure what to talk about
i saw you on sky news a while ago
that was a dark day
sorry to remind you of it
there are worse things than libel though i cant immediately think of one in my business
youre writing a book now martin said
i love henrik
together theyre the old sweden and the new
you know about harriet right
blomkvist doesnt say
the sound of the wind stops
martin emerges from the cellar with a bottle of wine in hand and returns with it to the dining room
the family doesnt like to talk about it but it cant just be swept under the rug
martin doesnt comment
dragon tattoo final sz maybe we could talk about that later
we can talk about it now
blomkvist glances to liv liv knows everything about my crazy family
which is why shell never marry me
thats one reason
she holds up her left hand
a wedding ring is on it
the couple seems very comfortable with each other not unlike blomkvist and erika
dont put that in your book
anything else is fine
everything changed after that
not just the family but the company
were not nordea or ericsson but were still the largest family owned company in the country
at the height we had employees
we have about half that now and that downward slide anyone can tell you began after my sisters death
it broke henriks entrepreneurial spirit and his heart
and martins too clearly
blomkvist dares to ask as innocently as possible you were here that day
everyone was here though i didnt get in until after the accident on the bridge
i know it well
it was a terrible day
and the days after searching and not finding her were even worse
liv sets her hand atop her boyfriends
this event mikael has to be a big part of your book
blomkvist promises him with a nod that it will
as salander moves with a crowd toward the doors of a subway car someone behind her roughly yanks the strap of her messenger bag from her shoulder she gives chase
pushes past people catches up with the junkie grapples with him
he slugs her
she goes down but doesnt give up
catches up with him on the escalator throws him back down it
the bag slams onto the metal stairs too but at least she has it now
she doesnt run
she waits at the top and watches the junkie drag himself up and think about trying again
he wisely decides to let it go hops to the down escalator and disappears into the underground station
blomkvist sifts through a box containing some of harriets personal belongings school papers textbooks a bible the address book her wallet and id
a knock on the door
he puts the box in a closet on top of others kicks it closed opens the front door to find a not unattractive woman in her s on his porch
i thought id come over and say hello
cecilia regards blomkvists vanger family tree on the wall
wherever he only has an old photo theres a post it next to it that reads recent photo
insert of cecilias photo taken when she was a teenager and a post it with her name on it
were all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family
its not about the family
its about henrik and the company
like i said
its not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone
unlike the one that landed you in court
unlike that one
so what youre saying is youre not really here to look into what happened to harriet
then i cant ignore such a dramatic event but no thats not by any means my focus
so all those boxes gunner carted down here which are where
in the closet now
werent henriks private investigation
blomkvist cant think fast enough to respond i wonder sometimes whos crazier my nazi father or my obsessed uncle
insert of the photo of young harald in his nazi uniform on the wall
since were talking about it since you brought it up what was harriet like
im sure henrik has told you
he was my age then and so couldnt know what was really going on with a teenager any more than i can with my own daughter
you were her age
actually my sister anita was closer to her in age
insert of the photo on the wall of anita taken when she was about years old
she knew harriet better than anyone certainly better than i did
you should talk to her
id love to where is she
if i had to guess london
you dont know where your own sister lives
i havent seen her in years
we never really got along
im getting used to that comment
thats the way it is when youre always after the same boys
people generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point
oh im long over it and wont ever have to worry about it again
she hates this place even more than i do
she left moved to london and that was it
you couldnt pay her to send a christmas card much less visit
ill try to track her down for you
for myself then
she studies him
maybe hes not so bad
if you do and try talking to her about us dont be surprised if she tells you to fuck off
a tech tries to get beyond the dreaded blinking
on the laptops cracked screen
you backed up
hard drives at home yeah
this ones dead
salander against the store window cell phone to her ear
im sorry hes booked all day
itll take five minutes
watches people stare at her like they always do
the secretary comes back on
salander comes past a janitor waxing a long otherwise empty corridor
at the far end she opens her new guardians office door
as bjurman reviews a mcjesus invoice salander waits
the thick atmosphere reminds her of all the others she has sat in with school principals shrinks and cops
have you ever had an std
nothing from her whens the last time you were tested for hiv
dragon tattoo final sz nothing how many partners have you had in the last month
nothing how many were men
that last one seems to amuse him none amuse her
im required to ask you these things
its a matter of health
write down anything you want
sets the form aside and looks at the mcjesus invoice again
why do you need such an expensive computer
making coffee and sorting mail
i shouldnt even have to ask
i should have control of my money like before
and you will
once you show me you can be sociable and get along with people
can you do that
nothing from her shall we start with me
pause shall we start now
as he comes around the desk she eyes a sharp letter opener sticking out above some pens in a coffee mug a child has painted with the word daddy
if youre nice to me ill be nice to you
thats how normal people are
he stands in front of her his crotch at her eye level
youve done this before
you know what to do
she doesnt do anything do you want this computer or not
he takes her hand and places it on the crotch of his trousers
you feel that
she does and
she tugs at his underwear and
she doesnt move he smiles i like the reticence
i prefer a whore who pretends she isnt
its almost convincing
he grabs her hair and roughly pulls her head toward him
salander eats some toothpaste in bjurmans private bathroom
when she returns to the office she finds him calmly writing a check
here you go
he holds it out to her but when she reaches for it pulls it back a little
i know youre not thinking about telling anyone about our date
enjoy your computer games
she takes the check and leaves
she sits cross legged in the dark
the dragon tattoo visible on her bare back
blomkvist who doesnt care for flying pours two mini bottles of vodka into a plastic cup
he sprays binaca in his mouth
then careful to look both ways crosses the street to an investment bank
blomkvist approaches a desk
the brass name plate on it reads anita vanger
im sure i should have made an appointment
have a seat
the accent is all british
shes been here much longer than her home country
no trace of swedish anymore
he offers his hand im mikael
how do you do
as he sits she regards him a little more carefully
youre looking for investment counseling mikael
i would if had any money to invest
im writing a biography of your uncle henrik
thats why im here
she stares at him
he waits for the response cecilia predicted but it doesnt come
they sit together at a little table on the sidewalk
how is henrik
i like him
she does too
dragon tattoo final sz i havent seen him in over years
or my sister
or anyone else in my family
most of what im writing about predates that so your recollections are valid
i wouldnt know where to start if that was a question
i can narrow it
ive gotten up to the s
to the event that altered everything in henriks life
he nods everything i knew about that i told to whatever his name was that policeman when it happened
my recollections then were a lot better than they are now
im not speaking of the crime itself
im trying to get a clearer sense of what harriet was like
particularly toward the end
she was messed up
like all us vanger kids
at least hers wasnt a nazi like mine
was he abusive
i never saw it myself but you could tell something was going on
one day shed be withdrawn
the next shed be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school
the next shed be studying a bible like a nun no vanger was ever religious can you imagine
obviously she was very unhappy
she never confided in you what about specifically
there was no specifically
it was everything
it was being part of that family
henriks the only decent person in it
what do you think happened to her
everyone knows what
but you have no
thoughts about why or who
all i know is i always felt sorry for her
even more than for myself
i got out of there when i was and never went back
she would have done the same but didnt make it to
salander on a park bench debates with herself if she wants to make the call on the cell in her hand
she scrolls to nb and hits send
its lisbeth salander
the call is put through im fine
im sorry i missed our appointment
i had a lot of work no nothing to be concerned about i need another advance on my allowance
can i come to your office tonight
i dont need a pen whats the address
the taxi that first brought him here to the island crosses the bridge
again blomkvist regards the middle eastern driver who regards him in the rearview mirror
outside the buildings entrance with a backpack slung over her shoulder salander presses an apartment button
as she waits she notes theres no security camera
the door buzzes
she pushes it open
she moves along a hallway with both purpose and dread
knocks on his door
it opens revealing him in a robe
come on in
she takes in the layout quickly living room dining area kitchen short hallway to a closed door
pause so what do you need money for this time
grand theft auto
steps toward her
lifts her chin
how are you
been thinking about last time
decided you wanted to see me again
i just want my money
well lets see if i can help you out with that
he walks to the hallway
he holds out his hand
she finally joins him
as they step into the bedroom he roughly pushes her toward the bed
she puts her backpack and leather jacket on a chair
sits on the edge of the bed
he stands over her
she knows what shes supposed to do but seems unable to
is there a problem
i just want to know am i going to have to do this every time i need money to eat
its so cute when you do that surly thing
take my hand she reaches out to it and before she can react theres a handcuff around the wrist
he quickly cuffs the other to his own wrist
this is bad
she tries to get out
he gets her in a strangle hold and chokes her into unconsciousness
she comes to on her stomach sees her wrists cuffed to the headboard posts her ankles secured to the foot posts with silk ties and scissors slicing her jeans off
she starts to scream and he stuffs her mouth with her underwear
i have neighbors
he lights a couple candles
switches on some new age music
what were going to do now is teach you the value of money
he watches her struggle
but shes not going anywhere
he tears open a condom package with his teeth
i forget did i ask you before if you liked anal sex
he crams a pillow under her stomach and climbs on top of her
she keeps fighting but theres not much she can do handcuffed
eventually she retreats to another place inside herself
shes had to go here before in her life its the only place to go in such situations
the cat turns its head to a sound blomkvist cant hear
he has harriets box of belongings out again and looks at photos of her school friends in her wallet
then picks up the bible
handwritten on the inside cover is harriet vanger
he opens it at random
hebrews faith is the assurance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
through faith we understand that the world was created by the word of god and that what is seen was not made of things that are visible
he sets it down
rubs his eyes
everything his daughter his life this cabin the word of god is depressing
dawn light outside the living room window
bjurman at his dining table with a glass of orange juice writing out a check
in the bedroom salander slips on her leather jacket shoulders her backpack hobbles out to the living room
ill drive you home
i can get home on my own
are you sure
its bizarre his manner seems to be one of genuine concern
he hands her the check
then opens the door for her like a perfect gentleman
so next saturday here
the door closes
a lone figure hobbles through the empty streets
she sets a check down
on the memo line hes neatly written for food
she takes a bottle of water from the fridge and drinks
shower water hits the dragon tattoo on her shoulder blade and runs down past several others
by the time the water reaches the drain it has turned red
coming through trees with a bag of groceries blomkvist sees a bmw parked outside his cottage
blomkvist taps on the cars fogged up drivers window
a hand inside wipes at it revealing erika
she lowers it a crack
is it any warmer inside
as he tries to get some logs in the fireplace going using more pages torn from one of his books erika wraps herself in a blanket
the cat who has no trouble with the cold naps on the paperwork on the desk
what have i missed besides you
the steady exodus of two thirds of our advertisers
is that hard to believe
sitting up here in lappland with your cat
i can see
what she can see is the vanger research covering the walls and table surfaces and that the threads of the family tree lead to a photograph of vanger at the
would you like to meet him
maybe in about an hour
if youre interested
vanger and martin all but ignore blomkvist as they chat with erika over dinner
they seem charmed by her
i apologize if youre having financial problems at the magazine in mikaels absence
well work through them
are you sure
erika looks at blomkvist but he hasnt talked to them about this
how long do you think you can hang on
six months or so
that sounds about right
cheerfully you know i used to be in the newspaper business
we owned six dailies back in the s
we still own one
the courier here in town
i let my nephew birger run it since he cant run anything else
erika nods politely
so what do you say to taking on a partner
weve never considered it before
we value our independence
your independence is dependant on advertisers if were being honest
however much you think that is youd retain
we dont care about content
blomkvist suddenly feels like someone coming late to a party
did i miss something
were talking about an investment in the magazine
why would you want to do that
not for the return thats for sure
to erika i feel bad that ive take mikael away from you at the worst possible time
this is the right thing to do
the moral thing
thats one reason
the enemies of my friends are my enemies
i hate wennerstrom as much as you hate what hes done to you
so what do you say
erika half shrugs to say shell consider it
is that a maybe
more wine anna
blomkvist looks at erika but she glances away to vanger
i think mikael is adapting well to rustic life by the way
have you seen him try to make a fire
put the logs on end like this
he makes a teepee shape with his hands like praying
erika lights a teepee of logs in the fireplace
how long have you been discussing this with them
i havent been
they asked me to come up yesterday
why didnt you tell me
why would i
you live in the woods
so i deserve to be treated like an idiot
i wanted to hear what they had to say
you wouldve said no before they could
im saying it now
its not a good idea
you heard me tell them we could hang on for six months
i was lying
without their money well be out of business in three
you dont know this family
were not marrying into it
we are if we do this
its exactly what were doing
you want to say no
lets say no
instead of percent of something lets own percent of nothing
the logs crackle as flames climb them
she gets up comes past him unbuttoning her shirt as she disappears into the bedroom
he stares at the fire
im leaving this god forsaken island in the morning
so are you coming to bed or not
salander regards a selection of forearm tattoos barbed wire celtic bands strings of leaves and flowers
you thinking one arm or both
wrists and ankles
but none of these
just a plain band like handcuffs
its sensitive there
particularly the ankles
its gonna hurt
that doesnt bother her in the least
she rolls up her sleeves and watches him ready the tattoo gun
how much do one of those cost
a bland financial announcer reading the news
the graphic to the side of him is the distinctive v
logo of vanger industries
petrochemical manufacturer vanger industries has acquired a controlling interest in millennium magazine which according to analysts has been in financial trouble since last december when its cofounder mikael blomkvist was
found guilty of libel against hans erik wennerstrom a news crew has crammed itself inside erikas office where a reporter interviews her we made a serious mistake last year and we regret it
but were moving forward and this is the first step
you wouldnt say the first step was your sacking of mr
read the original press release viggo
i didnt fire him
hes on sabbatical
im not sure to be honest with you
hes at his desk the cat in his lap reviewing the album of photos taken on the day harriet disappeared
theyre arranged chronologically and vanger has noted the approximate time of day of each
the first several were taken on the manor grounds by family members of each other
the next couple taken in town of the parade
then dozens taken on and around the bridge of the dramatic accident
he hears the sound and glances out to see a television news van driving toward vangers manor a crew is set up in the yard by the water interviewing henrik
under his suit jacket henrik wears a cheerful yellow shirt
birger unhappily looks on
millennium is an excellent magazine
we also think its undervalued right now which is good business for us
is any magazine really undervalued today
how many will be around tomorrow
theres another reason
i dont like bullies
are you referring to mr
im referring to anyone who tries to sue their enemies into submission
wennerstrom would like to try it again hell find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight back
youre enjoying this
already its the most fun ive had in years
as a clerk rings up the items salander is buying bright yellow duct tape and a plastic protective mask she watches a shot on a tv here of wennerstrom being
interviewed outside his offices
ive always admired henrik vanger
hes a titan and a gentleman
but hes also quite old now which may explain how he could be taken in by a convicted liar
the report segues to another story
the clerk hands salander her receipt
her hardware store purchases along with some fresh dvd rs a couple of plastic bottles of ink and mcdonalds kids meal wrappers sit by her laptop
shes not typing on its keyboard but characters are appearing nonetheless as someone somewhere else writes an email the from box reads h wennerstrom the to box reads l jansson
blomkvist has returned to the accident photos
pauses on a blurry one of the fire crew the focus inadvertently on the background vangers manor
what caught his attention is a figure in one of the upstairs windows
he checks a scribbled floor plan of the manor and sees that its harriets bedroom
but hes not sure if its harriet
the figure is too soft to identify even with a magnifying glass but is wearing a light colored dress and has light hair
he glances to the family tree on the wall the teenage vanger girls photos three inserts harriet
they all have light hair and frankly all look alike
he moves on to the parade pictures
to the one vanger said before was the last picture taken of harriet alive
its not really of her
its a wide shot of the parade itself but she can be seen in the background across the street with her friends watching a float atop which some women in
harem outfits dance pass by
he slips it from its corner fasteners and turns it over
theres a hedestad courier copyright printed on the back
he turns it over again and looks at the photo itself
guided by the photo he walks along the towns main street to the approximate place from which it was taken outside a haberdashery window but its still not right
the photo was shot from a higher than street level angle
he looks to a second story window above the store
then crosses the street to where harriet was standing when the picture was taken
looks back at the haberdashery where now the owner peers out at him
on the pay phone outside the gas station i want to look at what the paper has in its archive on the parade
you already have what it has
in the album
i dont think so
because no photographer at any newspaper in the world takes just two photos of anything especially after having to climb a flight of stairs
the bridge accident happened during the parade
he rushed over
then mikael what have you found
but i know photographers
theyre the most insecure people on earth
if its out of focus or they dont like the framing they bury it
blomkvist follows the papers youngish photo editor up narrow stairs to an attic
the current archive is on cds naturally
the older stuff still negatives
what general period are you interested in
she glances back at him
the date means something to her but she chooses not to comment
she pulls four thick binders off a shelf from september alone proving blomkvists point about photographers and piles them up next to a light box and scanner
he waits for her to leave
she seems reluctant to
is this about harriet vanger
youre too young to know about that
everyone here grows up knowing about her
its how were taught about strangers
the door opens revealing salander
bjurman seems a little surprised to see her at his doorstep
my dear lisbeth how are you
i need more money
i need to pay my rent
she looks like a schoolgirl with her little backpack over her shoulder
how did he ever get so lucky
come on in
she steps inside
he takes her hand and leads her toward the bedroom
her other hand slips into her jacket pocket
since were still figuring out what you like i went shopping for some new toys
what did you buy
she pulls a taser from her pocket and jams it under his chin firing off volts set down on the rugged landscape under an almost moonless night sky the cottage
the cat curled up on a chair jerks its head up at a sound neither we nor blomkvist can hear and stays absolutely still listening
blomkvist scrolls through the courier negatives he has converted into positives and has loaded into photoshop
he was right
many more parade pictures were shot that day
several at street level a marching band floats children with balloons some in better focus than others
he reaches the first of the higher angle shots from the floor above the haberdashery scans the crowd lining the street
harriet isnt in it
but in the next she appears at the edge of the frame with her school friends
in the next shes further into frame
and the next standing in the same spot he stood earlier today
blomkvist selects all of the high angle parade photographs transfers them to an iphoto file and reopens them as a slide show
the first few accompanied by the default music minuet in g dissolve at two second intervals
too distracting with the music
and too wide
he adjusts the size function closer on harriet gets rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduces the time interval to make the transitions as quick as possible
he hits play again and watches a short jerky silent film a kind of electronic flip book harriet arrives with her friends
moves along the street
stops and faces the parade
says something to her friends
watches the float with the harem girls on it
sees something to her left
turns her head slightly toward it
her eyes widen in fear
she looks down
she moves off
her friends look after her confused
and then shes gone
blomkvist backs up to the frame of harriet looking off with fear in her eyes and for the first time believes without a doubt what vanger has believed for years
she was murdered
whoever she saw across the street followed her and killed her
the cat watches him
bjurman slowly comes to
it takes him a moment to realize its true
another to realize it might be better if he wasnt since hes naked on the floor face up wrists and ankles bound
he tries to cry out and realizes hes also gagged
she emerges from the shadows stands over him and he sees that her eyes are ringed in black mascara like some kind of ghoulish raccoon
she looks insane
as she steps out of his field of view and his hands struggle against the restraints
he cranes his neck to see shes by her backpack thats resting on a chair
i had it with me last time
i set it here
he doesnt see this snap
its not a snap
its a wide angle micro lens
she takes a dvd r from the backpack puts it in his player flips his plasma tv on with a remote
she got it all what he did to her the rape in hd
this shows you sodomizing a mentally impaired girl
if its ever seen outside this room wholl be institutionalized then
he starts to whimper
heres whats going to happen
he cant even look at her
his life is over
he weeps into the gag
look at me
she strides to her backpack
takes out a large dildo
gets on her knees and works it into his ass
she can only get it about halfway up
she has to stand up and kick it the rest of the way with her boot
he howls into the gag
do i have your attention now
she does indeed
he vigorously nods his head now and after everything she says when you can walk again which i admit could be a while were going to my bank
youll tell them i alone have access to my account
after that youll never contact me again
each month youll write a report of a meeting we wont have
youll describe how well im doing how sociable im becoming
then youll negotiate with the court to have my declaration of incompetence lifted
if you fail this video will spread across the internet like a virus
he stares in horror
if something happens to me if i get hit by a car if you hit me with a car same thing it uploads automatically
she fishes his apartment keys from his trousers
shows him that she has them
im taking these with me
ill be checking on you
if i ever find anyone in here with you whether she came of her own free will or not his eyes dart to the tv as he nods that he
not the video
she kicks him
then straddles his fat gut and looks him in the eye
i will kill you
and he knows she means it
do you doubt anything ive said
he shakes his head no do you doubt whats in the reports about me
what do they say when you sum them up
they say im insane
he shakes his head no no it okay
you can nod because its true
i am insane
she gets up off him rummages through her backpack again
i know itll be hard for you to abide by my rules
especially no more sex
im going to make it easier for you
she puts on a plastic surgical mask
he fears the next thing hell see is a pair of scissors in her hand but it isnt
its something else he doesnt recognize
she straddles him again
he squirms under her weight
ive never done this before
he sees that the thing in her hand is some kind of surgical device a shiny stripped down gun with a sharp point and a plastic ink bottle where the
bullets would go
there will be some blood
he struggles to twist his body away but its useless
she digs the tattooing guns needle into his chest and begins dragging it back and forth
he screams as dots of blood spatter her plastic mask
the job has taken her all night
the sky outside the living room window is beginning to lighten
she drinks a glass of water in the kitchen wipes her prints from it
she crosses to the bedroom where bjurmans toys have been wiped cleaned and put back in the dresser
picks up her backpack
looks at him
she sets handcuff key next to a dark stain on his stomach
we stay on the key as she leaves the room
hearing the front door open and close we rise up to see his entire naked body on the bed
tattooed into his skin in big letters from his nipples to his groin is returning from a walk and a smoke blomkvist sees sitting outside the cottage petting his cat
of course it cant be her but it is a teenage girl who resembles the old pictures of her
seeing him she waves
its his daughter
what are you doing here
on my way to skelleftea
i can only stay a couple hours
he arrives and gives her a hug
whats in skelleftea
light of life bible camp
blomkvist tries to hide his dismay
hes made them some coffee and of course sandwiches
patiently waits for her to finish her silent prayer and smiles bravely
theyre not dangerous
its fine nilla
whatever you want to do is fine
everybody needs something
just so long as its not god
i didnt say that
as they eat in silence blomkvist cant help but think about harriet and what vanger said about not giving her his attention when she needed it
im not around enough to know everything thats going on with you and i apologize for that
but id never want you to not tell me something even if you think i might not want to hear it
smiles thats what im doing
the afternoon train is boarding
its not crowded
it should have been me visiting you
he nods but doesnt believe it any more than she believes hes okay with bible camp
she climbs aboard
the train begins to move
dont go too hard on the catholics
the article youre writing
what are you talking about the bible quotes on your desk
the train clears the platform
he watches after it
what was she talking about
he glances absently to the taxi stand
hussein points to his taxi
blomkvist comes in goes straight to his desk sifts through the paperwork on it then sees the xerox of the last page of harriets address book the unknown phone numbers
he taped to the lamp magda sara r
mari it could be a coincidence theyre bible names magdalene sarah mary or maybe not
he digs through harriets personal things for her bible
since all the number sequences begin with he goes to the third chapter leviticus notices that its first facing page is faintly dog eared finds r
js verse on it if a dove is the sinners offering the priest shall wring off its head cleave its wings and burn it upon the altar
pinching a cigarette in a shaking hand blomkvist pokes numbers on his cell phone
instead of ringing he hears a beep
appears on the cell screen
back across the bridge by the gas station he makes the call on the pay phone
detective morell its mikael blomkvist
how are you
not still in hedestad i hope for your sake
the rebecka case you mentioned
what was her last name if you recall
of course i do but what would it have to do with anything
as blomkvist glances to the last page in harriets address book to r
how was she killed
arms cut off
like the leviticus dove
ambulance coming past headed for the bridge
but this happened in the s hang on a second
he watches the ambulance speed across the bridge
im going to call you back
what have you found blomkvist hangs up and takes off at a trot toward the bridge he reaches the manor just as the ambulance is leaving and martin is climbing
into his range rover
he looks undone
we were talking
he started rubbing at his arm
is he conscious i cant talk mikael i have to go go
martin pulls out to follow the ambulance to the hospital
blomkvist watches after them
the cat naps while blomkvist looks up the other leviticus quotes from harriets list in her dog eared bible the daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the
harlot profanes her father and shall be burned with fire a woman who is a medium or sorcerer shall be put to death by stoning theres a knock
he tucks the list in the bible sets aside and answers the door
frode comes in
the good news is he survived
how he does now we have to see
hes in icu
can i have one of those
he points to the table
blomkvist pours him one and another for himself
i dont want to be indelicate
but henrik promised me something when i agreed to do this
nods i need to know what he has on him
in case he dies
that is indelicate
and i apologize
i dont know what he has on him if youre asking me
and he cant tell you in the condition hes in
is that it then
eventually we also never discussed who id report to if something happened to him
youd report to me but does it matter
we both know nothings going to come of this
im not so sure
frode looks at blomkvist a little more intently
what do you mean
i may have found something
pause youre joking
blomkvist isnt what did you find
now its blomkvist who studies frode
hes not sure he wants to tell him
and even less so the longer he looks
the last time i reported something before i was sure of it it cost me my savings
frode studies him again wondering perhaps if blomkvist suspects him
i need a research assistant
can you authorize that
do you have one
i can find one
i know a good one
she did the background check on you
do you think wed hire anyone for something like this without doing one
blomkvists brain tries to quickly inventory his life pausing at its darker recesses
yes it was quite thorough
i want to read it
that i couldnt authorize
blomkvist isnt sure how to play this
then he is
sets his napkin down gets up and begins taking things down from the wall
only a few lights on in the milton security building
it isnt often a subject of an investigation shows up in his office but is always awkward when one does
frode was kind enough to share your report with me
it rests on his lap the investigators name is on it but i can find no record of her and im pretty good at that sort of thing
would it really matter what her name is
it would if i wanted to speak to her which i do
just like your sources
let me give you a name then
he jots annika giannini on one of armanskys post its
shes a lawyer
gestures to the report theres information in here that could only have come from one place
i think you know what i mean
armansky tries not to look sick
the reason you can find no record of her is because her records have been sealed
shes a ward of the state
what does that have to do with anything
shes had a rough life
can we not make it rougher on her
blomkvist just sits there the picture of calm
cacophony of loud techno and a fringe clientele
alone at a table drinking salander seems comfortable with the noise and her dateless status but doesnt avoid a glance from an asian girl at the bar and doesnt tell
her to go away when she comes over and motions to the empty chair
salander and the girl from the club asleep in bed entwined like snakes
salander wakes disentangles herself and is padding to the bathroom when theres a knock on her door
she stares it
no one ever knocks on her door
but someone knocks on it again
she crosses to it wrapping herself in a blanket
who is it
her mind races as blomkvists did to the news someone had invaded his privacy
she unlocks the door
cracks it enough to see him
he smiles but its disconcerting
shes not sure its a harmless one
may i come in
actually im not really up yet thats okay
he pushes the door enough to pass
has a paper bag and satchel with him
takes in the place including the girl in the bedroom in a glance as he heads for the kitchen
i assumed you wouldnt have had breakfast yet so i brought some bagel sandwiches
and tomato juice
good for hangovers
where do you keep the coffee
hey he stops looks back who do you think you are
im the guy you know better than my closest friends do
he opens cabinets looking for the coffee
we have a lot to talk about so why dont you take a shower put on some clothes and get rid of your girlfriend
blomkvist plunging a french press watches as the girlfriend lets herself out
in the bedroom salander finishes getting dressed sticks her taser in the back pocket of her jeans and comes out to find a table setting thats more formal than she
or anyone who lives alone is used to
breakfast is ready
he pours her and then himself coffee
i guess i alarmed you showing up like this
if you touch me ill more than alarm you
that wont be necessary
his eyes are not unkind
as he helps himself to one of the bagels
your report on me was quite detailed but for me not very entertaining
a copy of it sits next to his plate
it wasnt meant to be
when i write about people i try to entertain the reader
wennerstrom wasnt entertained
blomkvist lets it go
your boss armansky tells me you only work on things that interest you
i guess i should be flattered
he also says youre the one he goes to for jobs that are sensitive is the word he used
ill use illegal since that what it was when you hacked into my computer
they study each other im not going to do anything about that
i could but i wont
what im going to do is tell you a story
if it entertains you maybe youll decide to help me research it further
if it doesnt ill wash the dishes and leave
are you going to even touch your food
what kind of research
lisbeth may i call you lisbeth
i want you to help me catch a killer of women
hes arranged some of his research on the floor and watches salander kneeling before it her eyes passing over photographs of the vanger clan the accident on the bridge xeroxes
of the leviticus list and verses
ive identified r
her names rebecka jacobsson
i have no idea who the others are or how theyre connected to the death of a year old girl but they have to be
his eyes settle on her blue black handcuffs as hers settle on a copy of an old hedestad courier front page the article about the grisly murder of rebecka jacobsson
we need to somehow figure out who they are what happened to them what the leviticus verses have to do with anything she gets up goes to her desk begins
jotting something down ignoring him
what are you doing
you can keep talking if you want
blomkvist slightly taken aback picks up the leviticus xerox from the floor
would you like this
thats what shes jotting down from memory the names initials and leviticus numbers
she wakes her laptop husseins taxi brings blomkvist across to the island
he gets out with his satchel
whistles for the cat im home
he picks up the bowl of food he left on the porch unlocks the door goes inside and sees the cat napping on his desk
he stares at it
then at the door he just came through
then the windows all shut
nothing has been disturbed as far as he can tell but someone has been in here
a window on salanders laptop shows a map of sweden divided into its counties stockholm vasterbotten uppsala etc
she starts with skane
hacks however one does that into its police departments crime database or various county newspapers databases
she fills in the year field with and continues to types quickly
when we see what that is shes in the middle of typing this filters list homicide female rape decapitation dismemberment fire altar priest prostitute unsolved mari magda sara the search
produces a screen showing matches to some of the filter words the rest of the case synopses greyed out
but also with all of them theres this message full police report not digitized blomkvist watches a hedestad locksmith install a dead bolt on his front door
salander comes out of her apartment building onto an empty street
everyone is asleep
no lights on
it must be about am
she ties a duffel bag down climbs onto the motorcycle kick starts it races off into the night
salanders honda races past a pastoral agricultural landscape
an old police detective considers salanders drivers license her milton security id and a letter signed by the giant security firms ceo dragan armansky
no ones asked me about magda in over years
no one here even remembers her
he waits for her to say something but she doesnt seem to understand conversational dynamics so its up to him
why would a young lady like you want to know about such a brutal killing
it interests me
hes not sure which he finds stranger her appearance or her sincerity
he touches his own neck to indicate the tattoo on hers
a friend of mine calls me that
so you tattoo it on your neck
hed be horrified if one of his grandchildren did that but she just shrugs like its no big deal
whos this friend
hard for him to picture
but upon reflection i have a feeling youre pretty good at that even though you weigh what ninety pounds
nothing from her float like a butterfly
smiles come with me muhammad
the old man rummages through an old file cabinet
her husband was our first suspect the husband is always the first suspect and usually the last but not this time
we moved on to a neighbor
then a vagrant he pulls a thick yellowed folder out and sits with it and her at a table
once you get to strangers its only a matter of time before you get to gypsies and you know youre never going to solve it
and that troubles him still that he never solved it
how exactly was she killed
miss im sorry salander
miss salander if you dont mind my asking whens the last time you ate
i have a high metabolism
i cant put on weight
thats not why i ask
i ask because its better to look at what im about to show you on an empty stomach
he pushes the folder across the table to her
blomkvist comes in to find like morell did years ago a strange tableaux of suspects two of whom hes only yet seen in photographs on his cottage wall birger cecilia
frode martin gunnar anna and looking like an aging overdressed vampire isabella smoking a cigarette
to frode how is he
frode takes blomkvist aside
he needs surgery and theres no dnr
so its up to the family to decide to resuscitate or not and theyre not good at decisions
he glances over to them
isabellas staring back
howd it go with ms
she said yes
isabella gets up to come over to frode can i see henrik
he was asleep when i last looked in
we can check
no you cant check
you can instruct him to pack his things and leave
mother dont use that tone with me
to blomkvist this familys had enough tragedy without you dredging it all up again
actually isabella mr
blomkvist works for henrik
and who do you work for dirch
remind me who pays your salary
we should put this to a vote
dont be an idiot birger
its a family decision like any other
am i right
you are so seldom right about anything its hard for me to say yes
but yes no
we should do what henrik wants and we know what he wants
henrik is in there fighting for his life
this points to blomkvist like hes an object is the last thing he needs
a nurse chooses this the absolute worst time to approach isabella
excuse me mrs
vanger you cant smoke in here
isabella gives the nurse a look so hard its almost frightening calmly flicks an ash on the floor waits for the nurse to leave and looks back at blomkvist
go back to stockholm
when we want a false chronicle of the family written by a libelist we know who to call
as frode guessed henrik is asleep wired up to monitors and doesnt stir as blomkvist looks in on him
salanders motorcycle parked outside
as young travelers with huge backpacks try to sleep around her salander reads to herself from a bible by flashlight
leviticus if a mans offering is a lamb it shall be a female without blemish
he shall lay his hand upon its head slaughter it
empty its blood on the base of the altar
and he shall be forgiven
another police station
isaksson is on the phone forget what she looks like i vouch for her another old police detective has salanders credentials and a phone in hand shes smart
and shes serious about this
the old uddevalla detective regards salander waiting at the counter
into the phone convinced but just barely all right
he hangs up
to salander this way miss
he escorts her to the file room
just like isaksson the uddevalla detective pulls open an old cabinet drawer finds a particular ancient folder in it and hands it to salander
she begins flipping through the reports and crime photos inside it but we dont see them
can i make copies
i can make them for you if our machines been repaired
she begins photographing the reports and crime scene pictures with her camera as the detective watches her not without some kind of strange sense of admiration
blomkvist considers birgers photo on his wall brother of cecilia son of harald the nazi years old when his cousin harriet disappeared
blomkvist and martin drink skane
martins normally breezy demeanor seems to have suffered from his mothers public displays
embarrassed by them and her hes more serious now
my family is impossible
its why the company is such a mess
please accept my apology for my mothers behavior
its all right
its not all right shes unbearable
but it has nothing to do with you
its between her and henrik
she lost it when my father died
the drinking her state of mind it all got so bad henrik took me and my sister away from her leaving her alone in our old house on the other
side of the island like she was excommunicated
shes never forgiven him
and he seems as lost now as he must have been then
you have to stay and keep working
youre henriks last chance at some kind of resolution
put this to rest for him one way of the other and ill try to keep my mother away
but please do it as quickly as you can
ill try they glance off to the sound of a motorcycle
it appears roars up parks
salander climbs off it and shoulders a duffel bag
blomkvist seems surprised to see her
lisbeth this is martin vanger
how do you do
she comes past them without another word
martin cant help noticing her wasp and handcuff tattoos
looks after her as she disappears into the cottage
its hard to believe but he has to ask girlfriend
blomkvist comes in as martin drives off
salander is already unpacking her things laptop charger change of clothes
whats she doing moving in
any trouble finding the place
everyone in town knows who and where you are
are you hungry
want a sandwich
busy setting up her laptop on his desk starting it up sitting down at it shes all but ignoring him
i used to have a motorcycle
when i was
she hands him her own dog eared bible and a copy of the list of names and initials he gave her the five cases from harriets list
and five more she missed three im sure about
blomkvist stares at her but shes turned back to her laptop bringing up police reports and crime scene photos
rebecka was the first like you thought
is mari holmberg a prostitute in kalmar murdered in
leviticus verse line
dragon tattoo final sz reading from it if a man lies with a woman having her sickness he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered the fountain of
blomkvist doesnt see a connection
she was raped and stabbed but the cause of death was suffocation with a sanitary napkin
rakel lunde salander brings up more crime photos cleaning woman and part time palm reader tied up with a clothesline gagged raped head crushed with a rock

before blomkvist can find the verse shes on to the next ones
more photos of murdered girls eva gustavsson
raped strangled a burnt pigeon tied around her neck
lena andersson a student
raped stabbed decapitated okay im not done its all right were looking for a serial murderer
but what does it have to do with a year old girl on an island
salander as we know is not paid to give her opinion
shes a hunter gatherer not an analyst
but blomkvist asked so she gives it she was looking for him too
the silence they just left has followed them out here
the island more than ever feels haunted as blomkvist looks off smoking
anything im missing
theyre all biblical
the first woman the whore the virgin mary sara rakel all from the old testament
which means theyre jewish names
he glances off to haralds dark house
if theres one thing the vangers have more than their share of its nazis
theres one of them
the nazis shadowy form crosses behind the shades
he pokes at embers in the fireplace to try coax some flames
i can see why armansky values you so highly
your work is very good
it interests me
he takes a blanket from the back of a chair
ill take the couch
you can have the bed
i can sleep on a couch
so can i
she takes the blanket from him and sits with it on the couch
he watches her a moment
heads off to the bedroom good night
she switches off the lamp
then in a moment in the dark harriets name isnt
salander browses through an iphoto album of old photographs of blomkvist and the motorcycle he mentioned
in some of them erika is with him
in all of them hes wearing a leather jacket not unlike salanders
what are you doing
hes just woken up in a tangle of blankets on the couch to see her at his laptop
she closes the album leaving on the screen what she was looking at before his imovie of the parade and some annotated police files
going over your notes
she gives him a dont be a child look
have some coffee
and then well have a talk about whats yours and whats mine
blomkvist drags himself up pours himself some coffee adds some milk
dragon tattoo final sz its amazing what you figured out from the parade photos
too bad you dont have hers
she doesnt say
he comes over
she plays the imovie stops on a frame before harriet turns her head
points to a young couple standing among the people behind her
the woman has an instamatic camera in her hand
she advances to the next frame the woman has raised the camera to her eye
and the next harriet turning her head in foreground while in the background the flash cube atop the womans instamatic flares slightly
blomkvist is stunned by both the fact he didnt notice it before and what it means though the woman is taking a snapshot of the parade she could have inadvertently
included in it whatever whoever harriet saw at that moment across the street
he takes over his laptop from her finds the later courier photos he didnt include in his imovie after harriet has left
in one the couple is moving off the other way
in another theyre getting in a parked car to leave
he sharpens the photoshop contrast
the rear license plate is partly visible but too small for him to make out even by squinting
can you read that
a c three the rest is blocked
he focuses on a decal on the cars back window
the letters are even small and blurrier but she thinks she can make out n something r s j norsjo
then something k something r i f something i carpentry
points below the letters is that a phone number
too small to read
he gets up
heads for the front door to smoke his cigarette outside im going to have to go to norsjo
he opens the door to leave and sees on the porch the charred corpse of the cat
its legs sawn off and arranged in the shape of a swastika lie in the middle of a dark circle of blood
he seems too startled to move but when salander sees it she immediately gets her camera and begins framing close ups of the cat parts and its head resting atop
the seat of her motorcycle
blomkvist stares off at haralds house
as frode scrolls through the photos of the dismembered cat on salanders camera horrified by them she regards at a table across the room birger isabella and gunner
i wouldnt think harald would sign his name like this would you
i cant say i know how he thinks
has anyone spoken to him about me since ive been here
no one else
could she do something like this
frode glances off to her
shes staring at salander
and turns to birger
whos this creature now
frode takes one more look at the photos before im calling this off
youre authorizing me to rent a car
blomkvist and salander coming down a corridor on their way out
im sorry if that was uncomfortable
they dont bother me
im sure theyre not used to people who look like you
they dont like you either
a car and a motorcycle split apart at an interchange the volvo to the north salanders honda to the south
salander pulls her honda into an underground garage
no one says hello to her nor she to them as she strides through the place to the tech room
insert cases snapped open revealing sophisticated surveillance equipment several cameras mounts hand monitor cables
i cant give you any of this stuff without authorization from mr
so call him
the clerk picks up a phone but then sets it back down
picks up the list again
next time id prefer you fill out the proper paperwork
a volvo speeds along a rural highway far from hedestad and the vangers
on the passenger seat insert the car rental agreement a print of the parade photo of the couple getting into the car he was looking at with salander on his
laptop and a hand written note that reads a pov through the windshield of a highway sign alerts him the norsjo exit is coming up
the main street of a very small town
the volvo pulls to a stop outside its only hardware store
an ancient place with narrow aisles crammed with stuff
can i help you
the clerk for what blomkvist needs is too young
im waiting for the older gentleman thanks
he gestures to a clerk in his s helping a customer
the older clerk looks at the parade photo of the couple
the carpentry shop is gone
i dont know if he worked there or not
if he did maybe he used to buy hardware here
i dont recognize him
i had to start somewhere
as he gathers up the photos to leave im no detective but i think i wouldve started at the retirement home
blomkvist looks up
not a bad idea
salander checks a mirror of bjurmans computer on her laptop
skims one of the monthly reports she instructed him to write
a group of elderly men and women in a rec room pass blomkvists photos around
one old man offers this is brannlunds kid
he was a contractor the father
blomkvist writes the name down
you wouldnt happen to know where i could find him the son
next to his father at the cemetery
he was killed in an accident on a job site years ago
but she might be alive the woman in the picture his widow
she is still alive and sitting across from blomkvist in her living room as he takes out his photos in you were in hedestad with your husband
he shows her one of the photos
oh my goodness there we are
who took this
photographer at the local paper
she smiles at the picture it brings back good memories
you were taking pictures too
which id very much like to see if by some miracle you still have them
it wouldnt be a miracle
we were on our honeymoon
blomkvist thinks about making something up
decides not to
indicates harriet in the photo this girl was killed that day soon after seeing something across the street that frightened her
blomkvist nods mildred takes a closer look at the photo
she does look terrified
mildred gets up with purpose goes into another room returns with a photo album
leafs past wedding photos to honeymoon photos and stops on the only one she took of the parade
she hands the album to blomkvist
the snapshot shows the float with the harem girls in foreground and in the background across the street several out of focus figures would you mind if i made a
copy of this
he gets in the elevator without really looking at the figure already in it
a finger presses it
the doors close and the elevator starts down
hows your sex life
bjurman terrified backs into a corner
she presses a button and the elevator jerks to a stop between floors
i didnt care much for your last report
which she has in hand it felt perfunctory like your heart wasnt in it
lets see a little more enthusiasm for my recovery in next months
i under stand dont speak
i dont want to hear your voice
start looking for a shrink you can bribe to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me
she gets the elevator going again and steps closer to him
he tries bowing his head like a dog being scolded
she lifts his chin like he did to her before he raped her
and stop visiting tattoo removal websites or ill do it again right here
she touches his forehead
he backs away
the doors open and she steps out leaving him in there looking too frightened to move
the doors close
having returned and scanned mildreds snapshot into photoshop blomkvist better defines on his laptop its background and the people in frame across the street from where harriet was standing insert
couples kids a clown
insert the watch repair shop clock that reads
insert a figure standing slightly apart from the other people
its too blurry to make out his face or age but he has light brown hair dark slacks and a dark blazer with some kind of patch on the pocket
salander blasts onto the highway headed north
blomkvist regards isabellas two photos on the wall
in one shes a stunning young woman
in the other the old wreck shes become
he glances to her husband gottfrieds photo
where a second more current photo of him should go is a courier article about his drowning in
thats when isabella changed and this is where it happened in this old house out on the point
he untacks the article
the boathouse hasnt fared well
neither has the dock blomkvist has to walk on to reach it
he glances inside no boat just dark water slapping against the pilings looks back to the shore at the long uninhabited cabin
no electricity but enough light spills through the open door for him to see the neglected shadowy interior beds with bare or no mattresses
sticks of furniture
old water stained books strewn around
beer bottles and other debris left by intrepid hedestad teenagers
its creepy even if you werent alone in it knowing what you know
he kneels to look at some of the books
mickey spillane a bird guidebook something called the evil empire about the ussr a childrens book
he opens this last one and sees harriet scrawled in a very young childs hand
having climbed the cliff above the cabin he finds himself at the highest point on the island
stops to rest at the ruins of a fort
a piece of the stone wall next to his head suddenly erupts
as fragments tear into his scalp he hears the delayed crack and echo of the rifle shot he throws himself to the ground
crawls desperately around and behind the ruins
sees his shirt is bloody but cant feel a wound under it
touches his face and finds the blood is coming from his forehead
he can see no one and is almost relieved since if he could it would mean they were walking toward him which would mean he would soon be shot dead
he has to get out of here before that happens
behind him the rocky cliff he just climbed
ahead of him a clearing leading to woods
really only one choice he runs for the trees
dives through a curtain of thicket and stinging nettles that tear at his arms and hands
crawls the rest of the way to the woods on his elbows and toes like an infantryman
safe for the moment he figures hidden in the woods he looks at the sun low in the sky and decides to wait
salander returned from stockholm moves around the cottage inside and out installing the equipment she brought from milton security motion detectors security cameras software that bisects a pc screen into
quadrants showing night vision views of each corner of the cottage
a figure appears on a quadrant of salanders surveillance pc
comes past the motorcycle and nearly reaches the porch before she hears its me
she opens the door to see him covered in blood pressing a torn piece of his shirt to his bleeding head and almost gasps
its that bad
she turns the bathtubs hot water tap is it still bleeding
touches the wound its still bleeding
why is it still bleeding
she pulls a length of dental floss from its case is that dental floss
splits it in two thinner lengths with her chewed finger nails feeds one of the lengths of floss through the eye of a needle what is that he can see
its a needle is that necessary
we cant just tape it
she perches on the edge of the tub where he sits still in his pants half submerged in tepid water bottle of vodka in his hand
did you sterilize that
she splashes some of the vodka on the needle
most of it goes in the water
hands the bottle back to him
drink some more
he takes a swig from the vodka bottle
she reaches to his face with the needle and floss careful its my eye
it takes all hes got not to move and even that isnt enough as she first sticks the needle through the flesh
he pulls away with a groan
she just looks at him
waits for him to take another swig of vodka to steel himself
she pierces him a second time draws the floss through the skin
and after that it doesnt seem to be so bad
as she works his eyes glance to hers with a mixture of dread and gratitude but hers are focused on the work
hers then briefly glance to his but now his are down
he comes out of the bathroom in his soaking wet pants and collapses on the bed
she works to pull his pants off
what am i doing here
why did i ever come up here
he touches the wound and looks at his fingers its too dark to see
did it stop bleeding
i think maybe it has
it still fucking hurts
she regards the surveillance monitor the night vision views of the cottage
she cant believe it but she feels vigilant more for his sake than her own
she goes to a window and looks out
sees her own reflection in the glass and studies it
then kicks her boots off
she comes into the bedroom in her t shirt and underwear
hes still muttering without looking at her
it wasnt an accident
somebody was shooting at me
these people are insane
no ones shooting at you now
she pulls her t shirt over his stitched up head cocooning it against her breasts
then im pretty sure this isnt a good idea
he extracts his head from the cocoon and looks at her
apart from the fact that im old we work together
you work with whats her name
thats worked out for you
i have some standards of behavior believe it or not
you need to stop talking
she climbs on top of him
she opens his dwindling pack of cigarettes
glances over to him lying next to her
hes not looking at the smoke but rather the startling tattoos on her bare legs and arms
eventually you want me to open a window
he shakes his head no
reaches for the cigarette
takes a drag
hands it back
comes out to find a proper place setting on the table
sits with salander
listens to that awkward but not altogether unpleasant silence you always hear in this situation the next morning
she breaks it i like working with you
i like working with you too
frode and martin stare at blomkvists unprofessionally sutured head wound salander near him like an emaciated bodyguard
people hunt on the island mikael
gunners out there shooting something almost every day for his dinner
it could have been a stray shot
not from gunner
if he wanted to shoot him hed have shot him
we get poachers
theyre not always such great shots
or hes right dirch
what if he is
this has to stop
frode regards blomkvist
do you want to stop
i have police reports photos henriks notes my own notes and lisbeths research
what i dont have are vanger industries records
thats what i want
blomkvist doesnt say
only will you authorize it
i could but why on earth would i
because im asking
the private corporate records
blomkvist nods how far back
all the way
frode exchanges a look with martin
henrik said i have access to everything i need
this is what i need
thats not what he meant
lets ask him
hes not well enough to ask
id be happy to sign a nondisclosure statement if that helps you
excuse us a moment
frode and martin step away to confer in private
i think henrik would say yes
thats why he has me
to protect him from himself
this is insane
what do we have to hide
over the course of years of doing business
if he needs this to do his job he should have permission
this goes against every privileged confidential bone in the lawyers body
he can only stare at blomkvist and salander across the room wondering why he hired either one of them
blomkvist and salander walk down the road from martins house
what am i looking for
any connections between the companys holdings and the towns where the women were killed
and everything about frode
vanger industries corporate archives are kept in the oldest building in the towns warehouse district
the rumble of salanders motorcycle announces her arrival
like someone visiting a relative they never liked blomkvist reviews yet again the photos from that day scrolling through the bridge accident shots he stops
one of the figures has something in his hand he hadnt noticed before
it and the figure are somewhat blurred in movement but it looks like a gun
he sharpens the contrast to reveal that the gun is in fact a hasselblad type camera
looks at the mans face then at his wall of vanger family photos unhappy to see it matches harald
carbon copied or original documents from the s and s surround salander like the water around the island financial analyses annual reports internal memoranda trade union agreements brittle news clippings
corporate staff photographs one of which shes regarding now a much younger frode posing against a wall of law books
the photo of harald in his nazi uniform on the wall
your father was taking pictures that day no one has seen
cecilia looks at the blurred bridge photo of harald with the camera in his hand
then at blomkvist coolly
id like to if i could
so ask him
i was wondering if you could do that
i dont speak to him as you know
you couldnt make an exception in my case
he gives her his most disarming smile
it usually works with women but doesnt seem to have much affect on her
are you afraid to be in the same room with him
im not saying you shouldnt be
you wont help me
salander gets up and crosses to an anteroom where an unhappy older woman the archive manager seems to be doing nothing but waiting for the strange girl to leave
are you finished
i need to know where all the factories offices and projects were from to
you already have everything
nothing on subsidiary corporations partnerships or suppliers
then youll have to do without
frode said i have access to whatever i need and i need this
he said you have access to this floor
the woman stares at her for a long moment then picks up the phone
stairs lead them to a higher floor
the woman climbs a step stool
pulls a couple of large binders from a high shelf
salander doesnt help her off the stool and the woman looks at her even more unhappily than before
the blinds as usual closed
couple of lamps throw shadows on the walls which display hunting and military trophies wild game heads sabers and vintage firearms some of haralds dearer photographs some photographs in dusty
blomkvist alone in the room looks at them swedish nazi leader in the s
sven olof lindholm
the year old comes into the room from the kitchen followed by a housekeeper with a tea tray
indicates the younger man in the photo also in a nazi uniform that blomkvist is looking at
has no idea what to say
but harald waits for more of a response
taps another birger furugard
and another per engdahl
and another me
blomkvists eyes shift to a bolt action mauser infantry rifle displayed on a shelf
but your interest is in my more candid photographic work
spread out on the desk a map of sweden showing the factory sites and other vanger holdings and one she made earlier where the nine women were murdered
dots appear at the same locations on both
on a handwritten list of the victims she puts a check next to rebecka jacobsson hedestad moves on to mari holmberg kalmar begins sifting through the mountain of vanger industries
clippings from that year
a bony nazi pouring tea in a shadowy room with you is bad but the rabbit print tea cozy only makes it worse
blomkvist tries to ignore him settling back in his worn leather chair with his chipped cup and sifts through an old shoebox of unsorted photographs a holiday at lake como
early s judging from the cars a vanger family gathering long ago some men posing by a slain wild boar dangling from a rope
harald holds out a pack of cigarettes
blomkvist comes over pulls one out
lights the cigarette with an o or a u
harald doesnt say it but his nod means not jewish then
good blomkvist returns to the photos glancing up occasionally to the smoke curling up past haralds face as he examines the journalist at work
im not a recluse
i dont close my door to anyone
they just dont visit
perhaps if you redecorated
hide the past like they do
under a thin shiny veneer
like an ikea table
blomkvist shrugs im the most honest of all of them
blomkvist opens another shoebox
lying on top is a photograph of the bridge accident and under it a few more
he takes them out and angles them toward a lamp
two point eight
the zeiss tessar on my hasselblad
blomkvist tries to nod appreciatively but the bridge photos dont tell him anything he doesnt already know
he finds several more that appear to be a hunting expedition men and blood hounds but then sees morell in one more policemen and a stricken henrik in boots and
raincoat and realizes this is the search party
off to the side a young man head turned half away wearing a dark blazer with a gold patch which that
zeiss lens makes clear is a prep school insignia
some nice landscapes there
no its i cant tell who it is from this angle
he takes the photo over to the nazi who only has to glance at it a moment to recognize his late nephews son thats gottfrieds boy
harald nods hands it back smokes
its not unusual martin would have joined the search party it would be unusual if he hadnt its his sister thats missing but this blazer hes wearing troubles blomkvist handsome
but useless young man martin
like his father
the archive manager shoulders her purse locks her anteroom and approaches salander
without looking up nowhere near finished
im not staying late
and i need access to all the rooms including any that are locked
nothing from the woman call frode
as henrik naps and martin clears his dinner tray frode listens to the caller on the room phone she wants to look at everything
i dont like her and i dont trust her
theres something wrong with her
hang on a second to martin im going to let you decide
takes the phone yes ingrid whats the problem
this girl wants a set of keys now
to my room as well
just tell her to make sure to leave the keys with security when shes done
having found nothing of interest in the files salander moves on to the killing of rakel lunde
the older woman comes back
drops a set of keys on the desk
stay all night if you want
leave the keys with the guard
the woman leaves
her footsteps echo and fade
salander reads a yellowed clipping from a landskrona newspaper
its about vanger industries hiring a local contractor carlen construction to build a plant
gottfried vanger here to sign the contract
but all that really interests salander is the date
the article was published one day after the paper printed the story of the discovery of rakels battered naked body
salander flips through the handwritten notes she made during her talk with the retired detective in landskrona and finds that part time palm reader rakels main job was as a
cleaning woman for carlen construction
the detective interviewed her co workers but no one from vanger industries including that firms representative in town for a few days gottfried vanger
which one was he again
salander brings up on her laptop photographs she took of the wall of the cottage the vanger family tree
gottfried vanger son of margareta richard the nazi husband of crazy isabella father of martin and harriet of all the vangers at least back in when harriet was born gottfried
was the most handsome
clark gable good looks
she puts a check next to rakels name and returns to mari holmberg and the vanger files
blomkvist flips through one of morells reports stating everyones whereabouts on the day harriets disappeared
insert across from martin vangers name it reads arrived on train
he brings up the photoshop enhanced brannlund parade photo on his laptop insert the figure with the blazer and pocket patch standing near the watch repair clock which reads
and the photo harald let him take with him of gottfrieds useless boy insert young martin with the search party the emblem clearly visible on his blazer pccket
he shuffles through copies of articles in salanders victims files
looks at the last one lena andersson
the photo is a school wallet photo
insert shes wearing a sweater with the same uppsala prep school lion emblem as martin
he looks at mildreds parade photo of the figure standing near the watch repair clock
and the photo harald let him take with him of gottfrieds useless boy with the search party
in it and the parade photo hes wearing the same blazer
he shuffles through copies of articles in salanders victims files
looks at the last one lena andersson
the photo is a school wallet photo in a sweater with the same uppsala prep school lion emblem as martin
knowing what shes looking for now salander finds it fairly quickly a clipping about a timber company vanger industries bought in kalmar and an interview in its local paper with
gottfried two days after maris murder
she jumps to magda lovisa sjoberg karlstad and an article in its local paper this time with a photo of gottfried about a union dispute at its factory there
blomkvist comes out with his cell phone tries to make a bar or two materialize on it
dials but only gets a beep that asks him if he wants to retry
instead under the darkening sky he looks off to the point
martins house is small in the distance but he can see theres no car in the driveway and no lights on
he stares at it for a long time
salander pulls a uddevalla paper from the files
same day this time the same page of the newspaper lea perssons horrific murder and an story quoting gottfried about an expansion project to the towns harbor
she regards gottfrieds newsprint photo his face looks more than years older than the one in kalmar but thats what drinking to excess and murder perhaps does to you
blomkvist lays the lena andersson article and the photograph of the figure at the parade atop the rest of the junk on the desk and quickly scrolls through photos on
his laptop leaving on the screen for salander to see when she returns martins recent vanger industries pr portrait
salander has hit a snag
we stay to have a look at the problem she leaves the victims list now with gottfried jotted down next to all but one name lena andersson uppsala next to
it the newspaper article about the murdered girl with a school photo
and next to that the reason theres no gottfried notation his obituary in a hedestad courier clipping
we listen to the fading echo of salanders footsteps as annoying as the older woman was it was less creepy with her around
salander is alone in the old building now wandering through it looking for vending machines
she finds some
drops coins in one
a cup fills with coffee
she gets a candy bar from another
the coffee machine finishes
the place again plunges into silence
she starts back with her snack down a hallway trying to look like hes just out for a stroll blomkvist walks past martins dark house then turns around walks up
the front path to the porch and makes a show of knocking on the door just in case anyone on the island can see him which is doubtful in this darkness
he tries the door
comes down off the porch as if leaving but then veers off the path and walks around to the side of the house
he peers through a floor to ceiling window but cant see much inside
comes around to the back and looks in another window
tries the back door
he cant see a lot in the dark but doesnt dare switch on any lights
he crosses through the kitchen but we stay behind to regard a closed basement door
we pick him up again as he comes into the living room follow him to a wall of glass
its pitch black outside
we follow him down a hallway but stop at a bedroom doorway as if this is as far as we care to go
we stay at the threshold and watch him go in and look around
as he begins rummaging around the recesses of a closet
a pair of headlights comes across the bridge
blomkvist comes back to the wall of glass
still no lights out there
heads off to the hall again
the car parks fifty yards from blomkvists cottage
the headlights blink off
someone climbs out
blomkvist comes into a study
lots of books and framed photographs
he begins looking around
the headlights come up the road leading to the point
blomkvist approaches a gun case in the study
three of them and an empty space for a fourth one
the trees outside the study window flare with light
a moment later blomkvist hears a sound of tires on gravel
martin is back and blomkvist is in his house
we rush back down the hall with blomkvist
hopefully martin will enter through the front door because were going to try to get out the back one blomkvist trips over something in the dark and we go down
then up again through the kitchen past the basement door grabs a knife from a drawer shoves it in a back pocket hurries out the rear door blomkvist tries to
steady his breathing as he slinks around the side of the house
as he passes a window it lights up and we again hit the ground with him
he hurries across the yard trips over something in the dark a sprinkler
and goes down again into wet muck
he gets up and starts down the road as if returning from a leisurely evening walk which would be more convincing without the limp not daring to look back as
his heart pounds
martin comes down his porch and walks toward his car
your evening stroll
how are you
martin pulls a golf bag from his trunk and shoulders it
i stopped at the hospital on my way home
henrik asked me to ask you something
come on in ill make you a drink
naturally this is the last thing blomkvist wants to do but it would be more suspicious if he refuses
he heads back to martins house trying not to limp
finished with her candy bar and coffee salander opens the files looks through the clippings for anything of note in uppsala where lena was killed
she finds no news of factories opening there that year but she does come across a pr newsletter about a winter retreat for fifty employees and their families
theres a photo of henrik presenting someone with a best worker of the year plaque
and another taken at a dinner for twenty guests and vanger family members the camera has captured henrik presiding at the head of the table putting on a brave face
raising a champagne flute as everyone else does the same except for the young man at the far right foreground
he looks sullen
but what teenager wouldnt at an event as boring as this
salander would look even more sullen
she checks the caption and reads far right martin vanger currently studying in uppsala
same place as lena though its what young martin is wearing that strikes her an uppsala private school blazer with a lion on its pocket the same as on lena
anderssons sweater in the photo of her in the article about her murder
its not as eerie with the lights on except for the fact theres a killer in it
martin sets the golf clubs down and begins emptying a grocery bag in the kitchen
what happened to you
the fresh mud stains
i fell in the dark
you dont have a flashlight
ill give you one
i just wasnt being careful
martin smiles but blomkvist isnt sure what he said warrants one
martin begins rummaging through a drawer for a flashlight
the knife block with one missing is right there
hows the investigation
nothing new to report
blomkvist notices a drop of blood from his pantleg on the stone floor and covers it up with his shoe
martin not seeming to notice finds a mini maglite in the drawer
dirch says ms
salander is clever
maybe shell turn something up
martin hands blomkvist the mini maglite
salander scrolls through laptop photos to the one at the parade taken by the brannlund woman on her honeymoon the people across the street and the blurry figure wearing the
blazer with the pocket square
martin pours scotch
hands one to blomkvist
what did he say
you said henrik asked you to ask me something
i just did
how the investigations going
that was his question
blomkvists eyes only dart to a rifle bag leaning against the wall next to a box of shells but martin follows them
we should go hunting together sometime
listen to a silence
nothing at all
blomkvist doesnt know what he means new
martin regards blomkvist in another silence
then i can see youre anxious
to get home
after your walk
i suppose i am
to have dinner
with your girlfriend
well have better luck with a gun
when we go hunting
martin pulls open a bar drawer and takes from it a handgun
rather than a knife
he gives a little gesture with it to the handle of the knife protruding from a back pocket of blomkvists jeans
there are fresh drops of blood on the floor next to his shoes
you just couldnt stay away could you
blomkvist doesnt know what to say
martins demeanor even in this situation remains cordial
i want to show you something
bring your drink
leave the knife
blomkvists hope of getting out of here unscathed is pretty much gone now
he pulls the knife from his back pocket and sets it on a side table
salander strides past the napping night watchman without leaving the keys or bothering to tell him shes done
crossing the empty parking lot she tries blomkvist on her cell
gets his voice mail
kick starts her bike
martin leads blomkvist from behind back to the kitchen switching off lights as they go
you know whats harder than shooting someone
just missing them
that was a very good shot up at the cabin
it didnt work
mikael it did work
they come through a pantry at the end of which is a door
sees steps leading into darkness
as they descend martin flicks a switch and bare fluorescent tubes flicker on to reveal a furnace
old discarded furniture
and another door
a steel one
as they approach it martin presses a little remote and the lock on the steel door clicks
push it open
as blomkvist steps across the threshold
switch is on the left
blomkvist flips it and a row of overhead fluorescent tubes flickers on one after the other revealing a subterranean torture chamber metal eyelets bolted to the concrete walls and ceiling
and floor table with leather straps bed with leather straps steel mesh cage work bench with handsaws and other tools blomkvist takes it in with one glance and immediately turns to try to smash the glass in his hand into martins face which is covered now with a plastic oxygen mask he holds to it
gas plumes down on blomkvist from above the glass comes out of his hand shattering on the cement floor the hondas single headlight shudders as salander comes across the bridge
onto the island
blomkvist comes to on the floor handcuffed to a chain that runs through a metal eyelet
he sees martin behind a video camera on a tripod focusing it a shelf full of betamax tapes and a tv monitor on which his own image then appears
note the steel door if we were close enough to it to notice which we arent is not locked
its not even completely shut
satisfied with the framing of the shot of his guest martin takes a seat on a comfortable armchair upholstered in clear plastic
he regards blomkvist calmly
sips his drink
then almost sighs
why didnt you just go home
i assume you mean the opportunity for that has passed
martin smiles appreciating perhaps blomkvists easy manner in this dire circumstance
howd you do it
what did you find
dragon tattoo final sz blomkvist doesnt say
martin looks like he has all the time in the world to wait and does
then we can talk or we can just get on with it
its really up to you
nothing from blomkvist
martin shrugs okay gets up goes to his workbench and takes a plastic shower curtain from it
as hes laying it on the floor around his victim blomkvist changes his mind i found a picture no one had seen before
in your uppsala prep school blazer
martin doesnt see the significance but is pleased blomkvist has decided to participate
he rewards him by suspending his shower curtain work to return to the chair
it squeaks again
what does that say
that you lied about where you were that day
or rather when
if i did so what
people lie all the time
it also said that lena andersson was a schoolmate
he has to think back to remember her lena was a long time ago
pause wheres this picture now
with all the other junk on your desk
a print is
digital copies are on a secure photo site
thats a lie
how much does the girl know
blomkvist isnt sure how to play that question
lets hope its as much as you
thatll make it more fun
where is she
she went there this morning
and thats a lie
shes sitting in our offices looking at more old crap
our archives manager called me very perturbed with this girl
i like that name
when lisbeth leaves ill get a call from security so i can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives he holds up the keys he took from
blomkvists pocket when he was out cold
i cant thank you enough for bringing her to me
as salander gets the door open with her key and comes in mikael
hes clearly not here
she goes to the closet
takes out the surveillance pc
puts it on the desk next to blomkvists laptop which is now displaying not the photo of martin he left for her but the apple default light spider screen saver
as salander begins rewinding the captured surveillance images backwards at high speed to get to earlier in the day martin reframes the video camera to include part of himself in
the shot sits again and crosses his leg like this is a talk show
dragon tattoo final sz so what would you like to know
there are so many things but also no point so blomkvist says nothing
youre the journalist ask me something
nothing from blomkvist
which is okay with martin he can do this alone what do i do with my guests
is that the question
well before i do what were doing
relax have a drink converse
i like that part a lot having a chat when you both know one of you is going to die
after i simply get rid of them
out to sea points off unlike my father leaving them scattered all over the place like trophies
thats not smart if you ask me
thats just garish and loud
but he was a garish and loud man
frankly he got what he deserved
nothing from blomkvist but he is wondering now what happened to gottfried if the drowning wasnt accidental
you cant be a sloppy technician like that
you cant drink to excess like he did
this takes discipline
its a science of a thousand details
im sure i dont have to tell you youre going to make quite a mess
nothing from blomkvist but martin nods
how do you do this and still function in normal society
thats the interesting thing
because most of the time i am just like everyone else
i just have a bigger secret
its wonderful really standing there waiting for a train or on a street corner as people brush past me
you know what i mean
dragon tattoo final sz you have secrets
you had one when you came up here
it made you feel special
blomkvist doesnt say
martin is a little thrown by blomkvists next unspoken comment yes but my secrets arent rape and murder no
im not a rapist
of course i do that too and at one time it was enough but gathers his thoughts to explain it a rapist mikael gets off on domination
discards a few other words before destruction
martin gets up and sets about the business of immobilizing blomkvist further with a block and tackle contraption of chains and straps
can i ask you something
why dont people trust their instincts
they sense somethings wrong someones walking too close behind them yet they dont cross the street
you knew something was wrong you even knew what it was but you came back into the house
did i force you
did i grab you and drag you in
i just offered you a drink
pause youd never think the fear of offending could be stronger than the fear of pain but you know what
they always come willingly
it amazes him
it always amazes him
he keeps working
and then theyre here
they know its over like you do and still somehow think they have a chance
maybe if i say the right thing if im polite or i cry and beg maybe ill survive
regards blomkvist and then the moment comes when they realize
no all hope is gone
and when that happens when i see the hope draining from their face like it is from yours right now whispers like its just between them well i feel myself
getting hard just watching it
you are a sick fuck
is this an interview or an editorial
blomkvist of course doesnt answer or comment yet martin considers what the journalist hasnt said
martin civilized people dont do what you do
youre right this behavior is unacceptable
i know that
but were not completely different
we both have desires
satisfying mine just requires more towels
martin regards blomkvist in a silence
then anything else you want to know
pause you sure
pause all right
whatever you say
he yanks a chain that feeds through the pulleys that lift blomkvist up onto his feet salander watches the surveillance images forward blomkvist leaving the cottage and property on foot
blomkvist returning to the cottage going back inside
blomkvist coming out and attempting a call on his cell
blomkvist going back inside the cottage
blomkvist coming out again and leaving the property
blomkvist not coming back
nothing but the sky darkening to night
headlights coming through frame
a figure appearing on foot at the front gate
the figure just standing there looking at the cottage
the figure approaching it and as its trying the locked front door the motion detection light snapping on and illuminating martin
martin moving to the side looking in a kitchen window coming around front again walking to the gate turning around looking back then walking out of frame
blomkvist hangs from the block and tackle rig leather strap around his neck now fed through a ceiling eyelet
with a big sewing scissors martin cuts through and removes blomkvists pants and underwear it might amuse you to know that while you were over here having dinner with me
and liv who by the way finds me very conventional irina was down here in the cage
whos irina you ask
a girl i met in belarus
just another girl
another immigrant whore
who misses them
he returns to his work bench to lay out various tools next to his gun and a desk phone
your sister wasnt just another girl
martin comes back quickly and yanks a strap that cinches the noose tighter around blomkvists neck as it lifts him onto his tiptoes
what happened to her
youre choking me you found her
you killed her
martin just stares at him confused
then you useless fuckin detective
he lets go of the strap and blomkvists feet come back down to the floor
as martin returns to his workbench blomkvist is not only scared to death but confused now
did martin not kill her
then martin is back in front of him with a roll of cellophane pulls on the strap again until blomkvist is balancing on his tiptoes and ties it off
too tight to talk
blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag
im tired of talking to you
he wraps blomkvists head in cellophane completely cutting off his ability to breathe and calmly watches him struggle
would you like me to do something about that
blomkvist desperately nods as hes about to suffocate
martin watches another several moments
then pokes a finger through the cellophane into blomkvists gasping mouth
im not a monster
he frames a wide shot of his naked prey
turns on some music
takes a moment to collect himself from all this strenuous work
brushes back his hair like he wants to look presentable in the shot
then smiles pleasantly you know ive never had a man in here
ive never touched a man as a matter of fact
except my father of course
but that was my duty
the circulation to blomkvists head is being cut off by the strap
his fingers behind his naked back claw at the concrete wall to try to relieve some of the weight on the noose but cant get a grip
martin watches the struggle calmly and just as calmly offers its time
i dont want to be late for my date with our girlfriend
dragon tattoo final sz he puts on a plastic rain poncho
a painters mask
picks up a hunting knife
steps up to blomkvist
looks at his eyes
brings his own head close to his victims goodbye mikael
he pulls the strap lifting blomkvists toes off the floor closing off his air again
and is about to gut him like a wild boar
when he hears a sound like some kind of animal behind him
he turns and sees her coming at him from out of the shadows by the steel door he darts for the gun he left on the workbench salander just as
quickly swings a iron his iron like a baseball bat
its metal wedged end arcs through the gloom and slams into the side of his head sending him tumbling to the floor
he struggles up to his knees and she swings the club again splitting flesh and crushing bone as he crumples the floor
she takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her other back pocket
grabs the hunting knife and shackles key and hurries over to blomkvist who only witnessed part of the spectacle before losing consciousness she saws through the leather strap around his
unlocks the chain
as he sinks to his knees on the floor blood rushes to his head bringing him back to life just enough to see what she cant behind her martin blood
streaming from the gash in his head getting to his feet
but hes not coming at them hes trying to get out blomkvist tries to say her name to get her to look
lifts a hand to try to point
she turns and glimpses the monster as he disappears out the steel door
looks back at blomkvist still handcuffed on the floor and like a child asking a parent for permission may i kill him
nothing in his life would allow him to agree to such a thing until now
now its as if her years of violence and degradation have been passed to him
she puts the hunting knife in his hand
pulls the gun from her back pocket checks the clip flicks off the safety and turns to leave he has more guns in the den i know
she comes up the basement stairs leading with her gun
distant thunder rumbles
she crosses through the kitchen to the living room and down the hall to the study
she eases around the doorway the room is empty looks to the gun case sees there are only two rifles there now
she hears an engine start outside
hurries back through the house
sees out the picture window the taillights of martins car receding fast down the road as clouds burst
she bangs out the front door
runs halfway down the hill in the rain to where she left her motorcycle jumps on and kick starts it
she roars onto the bridge chasing the taillights
guns the bike to full throttle
comes alongside him
he swerves to try to crush her against the railing but she hits the brakes avoiding the impact she accelerates again and comes up on the other side of the
he swerves again at her but this time the bike pulls ahead of him
now hes chasing her he gains on her as they near the end of the bridge
as they race off it he goes in for the kill but she veers hard to one side leaving him headed straight for the gas station blomkvist makes his pay
phone calls from and the tanker truck parked there martin hits the brakes hydroplanes into the truck and its or his own tank or both explode salander circles back
regards the fire engulfing the car
the rain does nothing to dampen it
she could probably brave it to pull martin out but doesnt
as the flames burn his clothes he manages to get his hands on the rifle he took from the den turns its barrel to his bloody head but before he
can pull the trigger she hurries over yanks it from his grasp and stands back again
its much more cathartic to watch him burn
she finds blomkvist in the living room
sitting in a chair his coat wrapped around him
the hunting knife in his hand
distant sirens echo
he can still just barely manage to speak where is he
reminiscent of the last photographs taken on the hedeby island bridge forty years ago police and firemen finish up at the crash site
a winch drags martins charred black wreck of a car onto a tow truck
blomkvist is asleep in the bedroom with what looks like a neck tattoo the black and blue mark left by martins noose that nearly strangled him to death
he doesnt hear the knock at the front door nor its open
frode comes into the cottage looking shaken
salander is the picture of calm drinking a cup of black coffee
theres no milk
frode absently shakes his head no
i have some very upsetting news
martin was killed in a car accident last night
frode isnt sure he heard right
regards salander sipping her coffee
i said its sad
pause what do you know about this
she doesnt say any more
frode gets up and starts toward the bedroom i have to talk to mikael let him sleep
its not a request its a command
frode is ashen as he leafs through a binder salander brought from martins chamber of horrors late last night a scrapbook of murder
a death book
photos of women cowering in his cage tied to the bed dead on the table along with souvenirs of painted fingernails and locks of hair all carefully taped into the
the older photographs are polaroids the newer ones digital prints
with little to no discernible emotion salander watches frode wince as he turns the pages
frode cant take it anymore
closes the book before reaching the end
just sits there
what are we going to do
were going home mikael and me
i dont know what youre going to do
im going to the police
show them the videos while youre at it
the salander points to a stack of video tapes
would you like to see them
blomkvist half wakes to find salander lying next to him fully clothed watching him
is she actually there or part of a dream
he looks at her a long moment then tries out his voice how is it someone whos is a ward of the state
im mentally incompetent and cant manage daily life
he smiles thinking its joke
it isnt he realizes
since when have they said that
since i was twelve
something happened when you were twelve
she doesnt say
just studies him
its all right you dont have to tell me anything i tried to kill my father
i burned him alive
got about percent of him
then we need milk
she pours milk in her coffee from the carton she just bought
pushes over two faded polaroid photos
he picks them up one shows a young girl about naked from the waist up head turned half away from the camera
the second shows her on her stomach on a bed completely naked face turned to the photographer frightened
i think so
blomkvist cant look at the photos long
sets them down
somethings troubling him martin didnt deny killing anyone
but when i mentioned harriet he was confused
he was angry at me for not being able to tell him what happened to her
pause he didnt kill her
and his father was dead the year before
pause what if she did somehow get away
could she have done that
could she have done it alone
he goes up to his wall of suspects
is shes alive theres only one person in this family who would know where she is
he takes the photo of anita down from the wall
henrik sits in one of the chairs
blomkvist in another
salander prefers to stand
eventually poor martin
clearly he hasnt been shown the death book or been told the tale of blomkvists night in martins dungeon
i have to go away for a couple days
when i come back i hope to have an answer for you
such a possibility stuns the old man
he regards blomkvist a moment
would the young lady mind giving us a moment of privacy
shes my partner henrik
she should stay
a tiny tiny tiny smile finds its way to her face at the mention of the word partner
what have you found
im not sure
dont treat me like a child
i dont know
i need a week
vanger studies him
then ive waited forty years
i can wait another week
blomkvist and salander read magazines in a pair of coach seats
across the aisle occupying two seats is one lb
sleeping figure plague
they drink pints in an unpopular almost empty pub
a cure song plays
i always liked this song
nothing from her or plague you dont
i dont like classical music
a strange looking young man comes in regards the strange looking trio at the table comes over
to the fat man plague
blomkvist starts to offer his hand before realizing no one else has or will
none of these people have much experience with human interaction
they all look at blomkvist but he isnt sure why
blomkvist takes an envelope from his jacket hands it to trinity
he begins counting it alone in the back of a parked van amidst electronic components he doesnt understand blomkvist anxiously stares out a tinted window at a dark row house
headlights flare down the street
an approaching car
he hopes it passes but it instead pulls up to the garage waits for the door to go up pulls in
he watches anita vanger get out of the car the garage door come down light go on inside the house then dark figures hurrying along the side of the house
trinity salander and finally plague
they climb into the van with their tools firewires a laptop
none speaks as they tether cables to computers in the van
blomkvist just watches
finally to him its your turn
blomkvist knocks on the door
anita pulls it open
sorry to bother you
she doesnt invite him in but doesnt shut the door in his face either
what do you want
no ones called you
she has two but doesnt ask which martin
what about him
he died last thursday
a car accident
nothing from her theres going to be a memorial in hedestad
i know you havent been back there in a long time but im not interested in any memorial
what do you understand
that you dont really care for any of your relatives
still i thought you should know
now i know
and now she closes the door
blomkvist returns to the van
howd it go
he sits and watches them monitor the phone and computer taps they installed earlier
one of the laptops without anyone touching it blinks on to a google screen
a screen name and password characters on a gmail page type themselves
they expect her to go to compose but she opens one of the messages spam deletes it marks a couple more and banishes them as well
the only new thing left in the inbox is an ebay alert
clicking it takes her to an auction for a triple strand faux pearl jackie o necklace pounds
the cursor clicks the buy it now button
as the screen switches to anitas paypal account blomkvist and salander exchange a confused glance
salanders laptop is monitoring anitas computer her hard line phone and cell
blomkvist emerges from the bathroom rests a hand on salanders shoulder to peer over it at the screen in one of the windows cards are dealing themselves
shes playing solitaire
salander nods and she still hasnt called anyone
do we have her cell too
salander points to one of the windows on the screen
his hand comes off her shoulder
i was so shed lead us to her
put your hand back on my shoulder
they watch the solitaire game together
theres only one reason she wouldnt call harriet
she cant because harriet is indeed dead
its strange perhaps but he does some of his best thinking during sex i was just thinking
what if ten more seconds
they lie there
then okay what
i was just thinking there could be one other possibility
blomkvist taps on anitas open office door
what is it now
he comes in and sits
i want to show you something
he tugs his shirt collar low enough to reveal the black and blue tattoo around his neck
anita is taken aback by the sight
its hard to imagine how anyone would end up with a mark like that
before he died your brother hung me from a hook
they sit together on a park bench
anita married in stockholm in
its recorded in the swedish general register
but the family never knew did they
she confirms that with a shake of her head im guessing she then came here on a passport in her married name and you followed on her maiden name passport
actually it was the other way around
she thought it safer for me to travel with spencer myself
what did he think about that
only that he loved her
she said if you love me youll do this and not ask why
he never did
they both died twenty years ago
a car accident
you found that too
blomkvist nods reaches for something in his jacket pocket changes his mind changes it again and pulls it out
is this you
he hands her the less graphic of the two polaroids salander found in martins basement the young girl face turned half away from the camera
i was the first time he raped me
no my father
he took this picture
martin didnt start until he died
blomkvist cant hide his horror even after all hes seen
why didnt you tell someone
finally henrik would have done something
i dont know
i almost told him
but i was afraid because of what i did
pause you still dont understand
she studies him and perhaps sees in him what salander did long ago that he can be trusted
a year after the first time after many times during that year my father got drunker than usual one night and started bragging about women hed killed
he quoted from the bible as he tore off my clothes
he wrapped a belt around my neck
he wanted to kill me
harriet makes it out of the cabin in torn clothing trying to get the belt around her neck off
her father can heard inside ranting something from the bible
i made it out of the house and down to the dock
he came staggering after me gottfried emerges from the cabin and stumbles down the hill in pursuit of his almost naked daughter
i could never fight him off in a small room but i was strong enough out in the open to deal with an old drunk
as he comes onto the dock she waits for the moment and smashes him in the head with the flat side of an oar
it stuns and sends him toppling off the dock into the water
he surfaces reaches for the dock planks
as he takes hold of them to claw himself from the water she brings the sharp edge of the oar down burying it in his head like an axe
he stares up her uncomprehending
his fingers slide away from the dock
his body goes limp and sinks out of sight beneath the water
when it was finally over i looked up and martin was standing there she sees her brother up by the cabin looking down at her
with a little smile
he dragged me back to the cabin
all id accomplished was substitute one rapist for another
young harriet and her school friends walk along the towns main street past crowds lining it and we realize were seeing what weve only seen in still photographs
a couple months later henrik sent him off to school in uppsala
and i thought maybe maybe the nightmare was over
until that day
the float with the harem girls comes past and we watch the smile on young harriets face change to fear as she notices something off to the left
there he was across the street looking at me with that same little smile on his face
a clear shot of young martin in his uppsala blazer standing by the corner smiling at her
it wasnt over
howd you get away
anita framed in the bedroom window like in the photograph looks out at the activity on the bridge
behind her harriet packs a few items of clothing
dont take anything
harriet puts the clothes back
picks up her purse
leave that too
the dinner that night
vanger noticing harriets empty chair
and anita saying nothing taking a bite of food
the searchers scouring the island
the boats moving along the shoreline
the crane lifting the truck from the bridge
anita climbs into her car outside her father haralds house
drives down the road toward the bridge
stay absolutely still
the blanket covering harriet on the backseat floorboard moves slightly then is still
a policeman on the island side of the bridge waves the car across it
as it heads along the mainland service road toward the highway she saved me
then she gestures to blomkvists neck
how did you get away
someone saved me too
he gestures off to the thin strange girl sitting on another park bench too far away to hear them
harriet does something she hasnt done since they met smile
blomkvist salander and frode wait in vangers study
a tea service tray sits there untouched like the first time blomkvist came here
anna pushes a wheelchair into the room with vanger in it
theres a file on his lap
how are you feeling
thank you anna
closes the doors
before blomkvist can say anything else i made you a promise
whether you found out anything or not
he holds out the file
blomkvist takes it and sees insert wennerstorms name typed on it and a fairly recent photo of him clipped to it
what do you have to tell me
a car pulls up the drive
the back door opens
harriet climbs out
looks at the manor
then walks toward the front door vanger propels his wheelchair down the main hall but stops when he sees harriet coming in the front door with anna
he stares trying to reconcile how she looks now compared to when he last saw her or maybe to convince himself shes really alive
she sees him
he begins to weep
she walks to him and places a hand on his hunched shaking shoulders
frode blomkvist and salander watch
one of them isnt particularly moved
as frode leafs through the file that blomkvist has already read i dont even remember wennerstrom working here much less being fired
why would you
it was a long time ago
which is more to the point than the money he embezzled
i dont think im seeing the point
yes you are
another look at the paperwork it happened in the s
salander watches the two men from across the room
regarding the documents i swear i didnt know this was what henrik had on him
if i had i never would have let him bring you up here
but he wasnt trying to deceive you
come on he knows you cant try somebody for this years later
i like henrik but he knows that
frode disagrees a mans reputation used to mean something he still believes that
im sure he thought you could destroy wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion
the court of public opinion dirch makes celebrities out of girls who shop
henrik promised me wennerstroms carcass on a plate
this isnt even the plate
i cant do anything with this
of course youre right
pause im sorry
blomkvist and salander sit out by the water sharing the last cigarette in his pack
her arm is draped over his shoulder which strikes him as the most tender of gestures coming from her
fuck these people
harriet most of all
if shed done anything but run martin wouldnt have been able to kill all those women
she had no idea he was doing it
she should have killed her father and him
thats what you wouldve done
not everyones you
shes not sure she likes the comment
decides she doesnt
takes her arm away from his shoulder
that was meant to be a compliment
put your arm back on my shoulder
so he drapes his on hers
then what happened with wennerstrom
how did he get you
i was stupid
i got something from an anonymous source who im sure now worked for him
it was fake
which he easily proved in court
not a good day that
then you were emphatic that the way i looked into your life was illegal and immoral
would you feel the same about wennerstrom
he regards her uncertain what she means
i started investigating him on my own
then you showed up and hired me
i havent had a chance to look at it all you and harriet fucking vanger have kept me busy
but i may have something
pause on wennerstrom
then rests her head on his shoulder
a new family tree on a wall here more complicated than the vangers the wennerstrom group made up of dozens of companies in cities worldwide
as erika looks at it wennerstroms swedish assets are genuine but theyre the only things that are
the rest is funneled through companies in gibraltar colombia and macao
these companies produce no products and provide no services
they launder money from arms and drug sales and crime syndicates in russia
and that money which accounts for all but percent of his holdings ends up in accounts in the cayman islands
its a completely illegal criminal empire
how do you know this
this time you dont want to know
this time i do want to know
i have access to his computer and his accountants and lawyers
she isnt happy to hear that explanation
and how do you have that
i could have gotten it from a source inside the company
but you didnt
but thats what youll say
but what will you say to me
that depends on if you really want to know
who gave you access
what looks like year old tattooed runaway lets herself in with her own key
crosses past erika with a paper bag takes out two bagel sandwiches the same kind blomkvist brought when he barged into her apartment
as she puts some water on for coffee erika looks at blomkvist
journalist mikael blomkvist who this time last year was convicted of libel in a stockholm courtroom doesnt seem to have learned from that experience
or maybe he has the report continues on a tv in blomkvists bedroom
dragon tattoo final sz in the current issue of millennium magazine he now charges the same company that successfully sued him the wennerstrom group of criminal activities on a global
scale backing it up with internal financial reports bank records and emails annotations almost as long as the article itself
the cover of the magazine features a head shot of wennerstrom and rare for the magazine a tabloid style title gangland
salander leafs through the article as blomkvist brushes his teeth in the bathroom
hell call it a personal vendetta but it wont work
fi cant ignore banking and securities fraud like this
the police cant ignore the organized crime stuff
theyll both have to investigate
well be back in court but this time itll cost him
thats probably it though
these guys never to prison
salander nods but its not really in agreement
or maybe it is
in any case shes not as enthused about all this as he is
i need to borrow some money
blomkvist grins and reaches for his wallet
his grin stays stitched to his face a moment then unravels
he puts his wallet away
i have a chance to make an investment
its a smart safe investment
i dont know that i have that much
im sorry that i know that
you have thousand in your two accounts
hes no longer shocked or dismayed by her knowing more about his personal affairs than he does
youll get the money back
several pages torn from pages of fashion magazines models all of them blonde their beautiful faces designer clothes accessories make up tips
applying makeup to the wasp tattoo on her neck and the handcuffs on her wrists salander pays no attention to the tv showing wennerstrom under an umbrella interviewed outside the
building that bears his name these allegations like the last ones from this so called journalist are as ridiculous as they are untrue salander purchases with cash expensive designer clothes she normally wouldnt be caught dead in
ill be seeing mr
blomkvist in court again
im looking forward to it
here shes buying a high end carry on valise and portfolio briefcase
what about his documentation
all of it
good wigs cost money like the shoulder length blonde one atop a black lucite head salander is purchasing
the securities fraud office isnt quite as certain as mr
wennerstrom of that
a place that caters to transvestites who among other things require as salander does latex breasts
if even a fraction of what mr
blomkvist is alleging proves to be true not only will there be a securities investigation but an organized crime inquiry as well
wearing the wig and a designer outfit she takes her own passport photo against a wall
she looks like erika
blomkvist names no sources
and we cant force him to
but we can look for them
beginning with those closest to mr
only someone in the inner circle of a corporation like this could have access to this kind of information
not wearing the wig now she inspects a passport plague has acquired for her featuring the crown of norway and some credit cards
on his tv a pack of lawyers stand where wennerstrom was standing before outside the groups corporate offices under as usual umbrellas mr
wennerstrom isnt available for comment today but as his legal counsel id be happy to answer your questions
where is he
at home i imagine
has he left the country
i dont think so
a plane touches down on a zurich airport runway
a customs official satisfied with irene nessers norwegian passport not to mention her blonde hair and bustline stamps a page
bellmen outside the star zimmerstahl hotel attend to the luggage of wealthy guests emerging from nice cars
as a desk clerk photocopies ms
nessers passport she neither hides from nor plays to the security camera
salander emerges from the bathroom without the wig on
crosses through the suite in her underwear
oddly or perhaps not shes also wearing a pair of white gloves
she opens the balconys doors to let in some air
on the tv with his failure to appear before a security exchange commission panel a warrant has been issued for the wennerstrom group ceo
an immigration official appears before the news cameras i can confirm that he left sweden on a private jet that landed in paris last week but whether hes still there
we dont know
he could be anywhere by now
she sips at her room service coffee
irene nesser enters bank hausen general under watchful security cameras
security cameras inside watch her and a banker at a desk in an area reserved for discreet transactions
i have a number of accounts at bank of kroenfeld cayman islands
i want to transfer those funds and convert them to bonds
as she writes an account number on a slip of paper from memory herr wagner notices as she intends the pen shes using from the venerable zimmerstal hotel
naturally you have the clearing codes
how many accounts will you be transferring
he glances at his watch perhaps thinking about lunch
his faux politeness even his appearance reminds her of bjurman
this will take some time
for which youll receive a percent commission
then it wont be a waste of it
she offers him the zimmerstal pen
thank you i have one
he picks up one of his cheap pens
she hands him a long list of account numbers and clearing codes as she sorts through a stack of bonds the tv shows a reporter in a colorful town square
a swedish tourist vacationing here in barbados says he knows where fugitive financier hans erik wennerstrom is here in this caribbean islands capital bridgetown
police released this photograph taken yesterday by the tourist jens assur a snapshot of wennerstrom or someone who looks like him tropical shirt hat and sunglasses climbing into a car
and say they believe it is the disgraced billionaire
sitting with a different bank manager now as security cameras keep silent watch she opens her portfolio and turns it so he can see its contents
he glances up with a polite smile thats supposed to mask his surprise
how many of these would you like to convert for deposit
into five accounts
he works out the conversion to chf and hands her the calculator a followed by more digits than we can count
that looks correct
the remnants of a mcdonalds kids meal on the desk with the wig and white gloves
she bypasses the hotels internet service uplinks her macbook through her cell
five accounts the ones she just established at bank dorfrmann appear on the screen
she transfers all the funds into one account at bank kroenfeld cayman islands belonging to a gibraltar company
irene cuts up credit cards flushes them down a toilet
drops the scissors in a trash bin on her way to security
irene disembarks with the other zurich flight passengers
irenes earrings disappear down a sink drain
necklace falls to the bottom of a paper towel bin
irene salander puts her empty portfolio in an unlocked locker wipes the prints from it heads for the platform
she has a private sleeping berth but isnt sleeping
shes smoking a cigarette next to a no smoking decal on the window thats cracked open and tosses the zimmerstal hotel pen out to the darkening countryside rushing past
salander looking like salander enters her apartment with only her laptop bag
holds irenes passport over a stove flame
sets the burning document on a plate
takes a coke from her fridge sits with it
puts the cold can to her forehead like a compress
then opens it drinks and closes her eyes
a dark figure is looking up at her apartment at television light playing on a window
as he walks off into the night we see its bjurman
the man who is now being called swedens pablo escobar may not have a country to call home but does have enough money to buy one
the reporter stands under an umbrella on the same street salander crossed to get from one hotel to the other
according to the international banking commission wennerstrom just days after the millennium article that brought him down appeared on news stands began emptying accounts at bank of kroenfeld in the
the place is trimmed with christmas decorations again
in a glassed in conference room blomkvist erika and a few others sit around the table their production meeting interrupted by the news on the plasma tv here that money
approximately two billion euros was then spread over a number of accounts with the help of this confederate seen here in zurich security camera images of irene nesser entering and leaving banks
who converted the funds into private bonds which im told are even harder to trace than wennerstrom himself
europol has launched a search for the woman who had used a stolen norwegian passport
her whereabouts like her bosss are unknown
her whereabouts are here roaring through stockholm on her honda like the first time we saw her
blomkvist hears a motorcycle and glances out the window to see salander pulling up outside
he comes out meets her at her motorcycle
she takes a cashiers check from her jacket pocket
the money i borrowed
it was okay
what are you doing later
seeing my daughter
you look nice
erika regards them from inside the conference room
salander climbs back on her motorcycle
see you soon
while the nurse fills a plastic days of the week container with a concoction of pills salander sits with her palmgren by the untouched chess table
can you hear me
no indication that he can i miss our meetings
pause im sure you dont
why would you
i was always such a headache for you
never showing up with good news
pause i have some good news now
ive made a friend
i mean one that youd approve of
pause im happy
one of palmgrens hands manages to pull slightly away from the other tries to reach for her perhaps but only makes it about an inch
she reaches over and holds it
a reporter bundled up outside a low rent building cordoned off with police tape behind the walls of this dingy rooming house behind me lies a body in a pool
of blood a man who has been living here the last three weeks under the name victor fleming the same cafe blomkvist retreated to after his libel conviction
a man who police in marbella spain have confirmed is fugitive hans erik wennerstrom
blomkvist is at the counter across from a barista but his attention is on the tv shot three times in the head at close range in what is being called
a classic gangland execution
what would you like
blomkvist glances blankly at the barista then back to the tv the investigation into wennerstroms ties to crime organizations worldwide will now turn to speculation which of them caught up
with him before swedish authorities could
wennerstrom spent the last days of his flamboyant life in solitude and anonymity locked behind the door of room a coffee and a sandwich
indeed after checking in he was never seen again until this morning when the building manager came calling to collect the unpaid bill a tailor brings out a garment bag
bearing his exclusive insignia drapes it across a table returns to salander the photograph she provided him with last week its of a much younger blomkvist at about salanders age now wearing the black leather jacket he loved and lost track of years ago
the tailor unzips the bag revealing an exact though considerably more expensive replica of the jacket
must be a very good friend
she nods hes lucky
a perfect christmas card vista that actually turns out to be a christmas card a snowy rural landscape scene
its stupid but shes writing under the pre printed merry christmas inside a personal note thats more sincere than she thought herself capable
she blows on the ink puts the card in its envelope neatly writes mikael on it gets up snows falling but unlike the brutal winter storms last year its just
heavy enough to dust the city in white powder that reflects the christmas lights in the trees
the beauty of her city pleases salander as she rides through it on her motorcycle
or maybe its something shes feeling as she turns onto blomkvists street
gathers the garment bag and card walks under construction scaffolding toward his apartment building
from around the corner ahead blomkvist and erika appear
he says something and she laughs puts her arm around his waist and lays her head against his neck scarf
salander stops mid stride ducks into an alcove under the scaffolding waits as long as it should take them to get inside the building then peers out again theyre not
theyve stopped just outside the buildings entrance
and the longer they stand there together the sharper the pain stabs at salander
finally they separate but only to allow blomkvist to unlock the door
erika takes his hand then and they disappear inside
salander cant move
waits for the pain to subside which it eventually does but only to be replaced with a sense of helplessness
then that subsides replaced with a facade of insouciance
the richest girl in sweden emerges from the alcove and walks back the way she came tossing the garment bag and card into a construction dumpster climbs onto her honda
starts it and drives off probably forever
