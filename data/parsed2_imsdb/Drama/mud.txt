written by jeff nichols shooting script september ellis sits fully clothed on top of his made bed
he is a wiry young man with a few blonde hairs on his upper lip struggling desperately to be a mustache
his room cluttered with junk is dark quiet and tiny
a backpack and an oversized walkie talkie sit next to him
the silence is cut by a squawk from the walkie
ellis quickly grabs it
im comin out now
he crams the walkie into his backpack and slings it over his shoulder
on his feet he slides open a window at the foot of his bed
hes out in one motion
ellis skirts alongside the exterior wall of his room on a two foot wide section of decking
he lives on a houseboat anchored just off the bank of the arkansas river
the boat is really the combination of a double wide trailer and a vinyl sided shack fused together atop large flotilla
ellis scurries to the mobile home section of the boat
he slips past a barbecue grill and settles underneath a lighted window
voices come from inside
slowly ellis gets on his toes to peer through the window
mary lee takes a jug of milk out of the refrigerator
senior sits at a small table reading a newspaper
the mobile home kitchenette is no larger than ellis room
i just want to have a conversation
i just want to talk about it
mary lee sits down across from senior who doesnt look up from his paper
her eyes narrow and she extends a finger toward him
if you dont look up from that goddamn paper
she stops before completing the thought
after a moment senior lowers his paper
he stares across the table at his wife
he looks at her with true disdain
his eyes trace down her face and robe before finally settling on his cup of coffee
he picks up the cup takes a sip and sets it back on the table
he raises the paper up
mary lees eyes soften
she bites the inside of her cheek to keep from crying
her eyes move to the kitchen window
ellis quickly ducks and mouths the word shit
he slips under the window toward a metal carport that covers a boat fish cleaning station and industrial ice machine
the entire houseboat is anchored to the shore by two thick ropes tied to opposite ends of the flotilla
the ropes extend upward into the tops of enormous pine trees
ellis sprints across a simple wood planked bridge to shore
his houseboat is one of several in a row along the riverbank
ellis scurries into the treeline and arrives at a dirt path
waiting for him there is neckbone a scrawny kid with slicked back blonde hair wearing a fugazi t shirt
he sits atop a smallish dirt bike
ellis hops on the back
what the shit man
the bike spits up mud as they peel out down the trail
from a distance the single headlight of the dirt bike snakes up and down in and out of trees along the riverbank
the sound of the engine rips through fog and trees illuminated by the straining headlight
the boys emerge from behind a sand covered hill
now on foot they are silhouetted against a light blue morning sky
how old is she
at a collection of trees growing out of the water the boys move branches away from a tarp covered boat
shes got nice titties
you talk to her
youre gonna have to talk to her
remind me when we get back to my house galens got a book on that
neckbone takes a spot up front in the small flat bottom boat
ellis a foot on the bank and one in the boat launches them out into the water
a chunk of neckbones greased back hair bobs in the wind as they cruise down river
ellis steers a small horsepower motor
an orange sun is coming up now
neckbones eyes lock on whats in front of them
ellis kills the motor
neckbone stands up a serious look on his face
ellis raises up behind him
he takes a deep breath nods
your dadd kill us he knew we went out there
im not worried about my dad killin us
the mississippi river sprawls out in front of them
their boat drifts at the mouth of the arkansas a small river by comparison
the mississippi is a swirling mess of brown water and yellow foam six football fields wide
what if it sinks
it aint gonna sink
we gotta move if were gonna make it back
set your watch
well need a good fifteen minutes
neckbone sets an alarm on his fat plastic wristwatch
they take their seats
ellis cranks the motor
the small boat slowly chugs out onto the massive river
the boat lurches through the murky rushing water
neckbone has both hands firmly planted on the boats edges
ellis tries to handle the motor which has little impact against this current
the tail end of the boat swings to the right
ellis flinches and grabs an edge to steady himself
the front of the boat bobs toward an island in the middle of the river
neck turns to ellis and points
the boys splash down in ankle deep water
they take hold of the front of the boat and drag it onto the muddy shore
neckbone jogs to a tree line in the center of the island
ellis snatches up his backpack and follows
the island only some yards in diameter is separated by a clump of tall trees that form a wooded area in its center
the trees make it so you cant see from one side of the island to the other
galen thinks its been here awhile
thinks the last flood did it
ellis follows as neckbone winds through the trees
they stop at a deep creek that cuts across the island
neckbone looks to his right then his left
sees what hes looking for
its down there
a fallen tree trunk that straddles the creek
ellis starts across
neckbone picks a large stone up off the ground
eight feet below the tree trunk a nest of water moccasins curl around in the creek
neckbone drops the stone on top of them
the snakes fan out
their mud caked high tops stomp across the trunk
the boys stop near the base of a large tree and stare up
ellis cranes his neck back
so there it is
yeah there it is
a foot long boat sits nestled in the tree limbs above
the boys scale up the tree from low lying branches
ellis hands on the edge of the boat gets a leg over the side and pulls himself onto the deck
he reaches down and helps to drag neckbone on board
they get to their feet steadying themselves on the wooden deck
they take in their new vantage point
it came down from up there
ellis points to higher limbs that have long been broken off
neckbone walks to the back of the boat and hangs his head over
he finds a gaping hole of gutted wood
motor broke off
ellis isnt concerned with the motor
his eyes are locked on a covered cabin at the front of the boat
who else knows about this
just me and galen
whats he think
he dont care about it
ellis walks to the cabin
he pushes a vinyl door open
cause this boats ours
ellis has to duck down to go inside
ellis stooping over makes his way into the tiny cabin room
yellow floral curtains stained with age cover a row of windows that wrap around the top of the cabin
these provide an odd glow in an otherwise dark wood paneled space
there is a bench with rotted out cushions to the left
to the right a mold covered sink and mirror
neckbone peers over ellis shoulder at the front of the cabin room
a small booth sits to the right across from a miniature toilet partially shielded by an open door
its got its own shitbox neckbone slides back a portion of floral curtain and light streams in
he starts opening small closets and drawers
ellis plops down on the rotted bench cushions
this is perfect
ho lee shit
neckbone stares in an open drawer
he removes a stack of playboys from the s
ellis smiles at him
he leans back and props his foot against the sink cabinet across from him
this is home
neckbone opens the first playboy
as he scrambles to gather the fallen pages ellis notices a dried boot print next to his foot
he lowers his shoe from the cabinet leaving a smaller muddy print of his own
he leans in to examine the larger print
the impression of a cross has been left in the heel
her tits are so small
ellis reaches out and traces his finger in the groove of the cross marking
his eyes narrow as he re surveys the cabin
on the table across from the toilet he notices several empty cans of beanie weenie
in the booth he sees a grocery bag
ellis slowly raises up and goes over to it
look at that beave
you gotta see this
ellis reaches out for the plastic bag
his fingers pull back the edges to reveal its contents one can of unopened beanie weenie and half a loaf of bread
ellis reaches for the bread and gives it a squeeze
ellis holds the loaf of bread up to neckbone
someones livin here
neckbone sees the grocery bag
his eyes widen
the boys are stone frozen
they listen for other sounds
both boys flinch at the sharp sounds
neckbones hand flies to cover the alarm on his wristwatch
we gotta go
i cant be late
they drop out of the tree and hit the ground running
the boys feet rush across the tree trunk bridging the creek
they launch out of the treeline and sprint to their boat
neckbone grabs the side and starts pushing the boat to the water
ellis slings his backpack in and joins him
suddenly ellis straightens up leaving neckbone to struggle
what are you doing
ellis stares at a muddy boot print cross in the heel stamped in the center of their boat
he looks back to the treeline then down the shore
he looks to his feet
the boys shoe prints make chaotic patterns in the mud
larger boot prints lead off down the shoreline
what is it
i saw that same boot print up in the tree
it has a cross in the heel
somebodys been in our boat
ellis begins following the boot prints around the shoreline
we gotta go if you wanna make it back
your dads gonna kick our ass
itll take twice as long goin up river
ellis stops and points ahead of them
neckbone takes the lead walking up to the last boot print
they appear to vanish
where the helld he go
i dont know
neckbone turns and freezes
a man has appeared in the distance behind ellis
he stands between the boys and their boat
ellis notices the look on neckbones face and turns
he flinches at the sight of the man
mud stands near the boys boat holding a pink childs fishing pole with cartoon characters on it
he stares back at them and casts his fishing line into the water
you know that guy
ive never seen him before
mud not taking his eyes off the boys slowly reels in his line
his hair is a wild mop that leads to two weeks of growth on his face
with a cigarette clinched he cracks a smile revealing a missing canine
he holds a hand in the air as if to wave
neckbone slowly raises his hand up to wave back
mud wears jeans and cowboy boots
his filthy button up shirt looks like it hasnt left his body in years
he breaks his stare with the boys
continuing to reel in his line he walks over to them
what you say
the boys dont respond
mud walks past them and casts again
mud takes the cigarette from his mouth
a tattoo of a snakes head covers the top of his right hand
two large cotton blossoms spill out of its jaws
boat in the trees
its a helluva thing
mud continues walking down the shoreline reeling in his bait
the boys follow tentatively
you talkin bout our boat
im talkin about my boat
we found it
you found it with me livin in it
possession is nine tenths of the law
dont tell me you boys are from mississippi
they watch as he grabs the bait at the end of his line and spits on it
then tucking the pole under his arm he ties a lock of his hair into a knot
he finishes this process with another cast
you got crosses in your heels
shaped liked crosses
ward off evil spirits
a man i called an indian but was meskin said they were seven league boots worn by the seventh son of a seventh son
told me itd turn me into a werewolf but thats a lie
i dont know nothin about that
ellis confused wont take his eyes off the man
they just good luck but so far they aint been workin too well
missing tooth smile whats your name
mud seems easy to smile which softens his otherwise coarse look
his words spill from the mouth rapidly without much thought for punctuation
neckbone emboldened by these facts steps forward to answer
im neckbone hes ellis and mister you may be stone ass crazy but i know youre not the owner of that boat not for nine tenths of nothin
thats a real handle son
where yall from
what do you care where were from
neckbone looks at ellis frustrated by his friend
yall had me worried for a second
mud pleased by this news tucks the fishing pole under his arm and holds out a hand to shake
ellis stares at the hand unsure
he takes it reluctantly
we sposed to know you
i doubt it
i grew up round here but ive been gone awhile
where around here
spent a lot of time back up near the white
you know shellys oxbow
neckbone cant believe his friend is offering this up
we gotta go
i know it
guy named tom blankenship used to live back in there
he still does
his boats cross from mine
aint that somethin
in one motion mud flicks his cigarette away and grabs a pack out of his shirt pocket
i like you two
you remind me of me
and seeing how you boys are from arkansas and we know some people and sounds like we all from the same place id say we can make a deal here
a deal for what
food for a boat
this guys a bum ellis
muds smile vanishes
neckbone begins to walk off but begrudgingly stops when ellis starts back in
why dont you go get your own food
i would if i could but i told somebody id meet em here
so im stuck for now and what i gots runnin low
neckbone walks back and pulls ellis by the arm
hes a bum ellis lets go
mud lays a serious look down on neckbone
im no bum
i got money
you can call me a hobo cause a hoboll work for his living and you can call me homeless cause thats true for now but if you call me a
bum again ill have to teach you somethin about respect that your daddy never did
neckbones confidence recedes
ellis stands his ground
when they show up youll leave
mud begins fishing again
and when you leave that boats ours
ellis studies muds face clothes tattoos
hes thinking about it
mud pauses from fishing to make eye contact
im in a tight spot
i just need a little help
we gotta go
with that ellis turns to leave
the boys walk briskly back to their boat
ellis looks over his shoulder to see mud making another cast with his fishing pole
ellis motors them away from the island
you get his name
ellis looks back
mud has disappeared
senior heaves an enormous white cooler into the bed of his weathered pick up truck
the truck is parked at an angle on a concrete boat ramp next to their houseboat
the bed of the truck is jam packed with six of the big white coolers
the sound of a dirt bike rattles through the trees
senior looks up wiping his brow with a handkerchief
ellis leaps out of the treeline and runs to the pick up
his hands hit his knees out of breath
where you been
neck and i got caught up helpin galen
youre sposed to be helpin me
i had to load this myself
i know im sorry
just get in the back
cant be later than we are
senior flips up the tailgate
ellis hops up the wheel well and into the bed of the truck
he steadies himself on one of the coolers as his father pulls away
ellis looks around as he rides in the bed of the pick up truck
hes propped up on a cooler against the back window
the truck works its way down a two lane highway
a driving they pass a marina junkyard filled with old boats a and sailing paraphernalia
b downtown dewitt
a gas station
rows of red b brick buildings some abandoned a small furniture store
c parked ellis fills a grocery sack up with ziplock bags fullc of white fish and ice out of the coolers
he hops out of the truck and runs the sack of fish to the front door of a house
an elderly black man waits there
ellis sits in the bed of the truck eating a chili dog
senior is up front wolfing down a cheeseburger
a group of teenagers are gathered around a cluster of parked cars in the corner of the lot
they meander between the vehicles smoking gossiping passing around a bottle of boones farm
ellis watches them
may pearl appears in the middle of the group laughing with her girlfriends
shes pretty and physically more mature looking than ellis
he watches as a skinny kid takes his ballcap off and puts it on may pearls head
she sniffs the cap gags and tosses it back at him
her friends laugh
lets go son
ellis crumples the wrapper to his finished hotdog and jumps down from the bed of the truck
ellis rides up front with his father
senior is a reserved man older than ellis mother by several years
hes got thinning hair under the cap that only leaves his head when he sleeps
he reaches into his shirt pocket and fishes out a fold of cash
he slips out a five dollar bill and hands it to ellis
its sposed to be ten
its ten you do your share
i loaded this mornin
that makes it five
ellis begrudgingly stuffs the five in his jeans
you drop me at necks
senior checks his pants pockets feels around under his seat
hadnt you seen enougha him today
said he had something for me
you see anymore ding dongs over there
ellis checks under his seat and pulls out a half empty box of ding dongs
hands one over to his father who rips the package with his teeth
whatd momma wanna talk to you about
this mornin whatd she wanna talk with you about
you spy on me in my own house
i wasnt spyin just heard yall
thats your mothers business
senior makes this his answer eats the ding dong
neckbone sits on the front steps of his trailer reading a comic book
the muffled sound of the beach boys help me rhonda plays off a record inside
seniors truck pulls away as ellis walks up the entrance to the trailer park
i came by for that book
you said galen had a book might help me out
we gotta give it a minute
you hear that music
that means hes doin it
thats his doin it song
ellis takes a seat next to neckbone
they listen to the song slightly craning their necks to pick up on any other sounds
there are none
you know who it is
whoevers drivin that white dodge
neckbone motions to a beat up dodge shadow in the yard
you tell galen bout this morning
you tell anybody
that guy was crazy
i dont know
i think he just needed some help
well he can swim his ass off that island and get some
i think im gonna go back take him some food
suddenly the music from inside stops
footsteps approaching and the trailer door flies open almost hitting the boys
a girl bursts out down the steps straight to her car
she wears tight jean shorts and is buttoning a white shirt
she stops and turns back to the boys
youre neckbone right
you look like a good enough kid
a word of advice dont grow up to be like your shit heel uncle
the boys cant take their eyes off her cleavage revealed under her half buttoned shirt
a necklace with three misshapen pearls hangs from her neck
she snaps the boys attention up to her eyes
you hear me
you treat a woman like a princess
the trailer door opens and galen emerges
hes a big lumbering guy wearing a full body wet suit pulled halfway down
a faded mermaid tattooed in the middle of his chest
come on baby
the girl yanks off the necklace and hurls it at galen
he brushes fingers through his thick mustache
thats uncalled for
he walks out to her
she heads for the dodge shadow
a lot of people are comfortable with that kind of thing in the bedroom
some people arent
we know that about you now
ellis sees one of the misshapen pearls at his feet
he picks it up and holds it to the sun
galen finds em in some of the mussel shells
most of em aint worth dick but he likes to make necklaces for the girls
come on lets get that book
neckbone walks into the trailer
ellis stands up and retrieves the other two pearls out of the dirt
he crams them in his pocket and follows neckbone inside
the trailer is decorated in the filth of a true bachelor pad
neckbone makes his way to a bedroom
he tosses clothes and trash around to get to what hes looking for
a cardboard box
he pulls the box onto the bed and sifts through
i dont want you goin back out there by yourself
that rivers scary enough with two people and i dont trust that guy
here it is
he takes out a hardback book
the slip reads the confident confidant communicating with the opposite sex
galen said this really turned things around for him
ellis flips delicately through the manual
galen watches as the girls dodge shadow pulls away
the boys step out of the trailer
you really going back out there
i think its the right thing to do
ill be over in the mornin then
galen his thumbs tucked under his armpits walks back to the trailer
he passes the boys and notices the self help book in ellis hands
thats a good book
be sure you do the worksheets in the back
lets get some dinner neck
galens gone inside
ill call fore i come
neckbone follows his uncle into the trailer
ellis flips through his new book as he heads out of the trailer park
by the time ellis makes it to his houseboat the sun has disappeared behind the horizon
he crosses the make shift plank and enters through a screen door by the carport
mary lee flinches when she sees ellis come through the door
her face is flushed
senior stands toe to toe with her
they stare at ellis who has paused in the doorway
he doesnt say anything just looks curiously at his parents
senior storms past ellis and is out the door
ellis steps further into the den
mary lee tries to straighten herself patting down her hair and dabbing at her eyes with the back of her hand
you okay momma
she walks into the kitchen keeping ellis at her back
she turns on the sink and begins scrubbing at a dish
do you need me to fix you somethin
have you eaten
im all right
mary lee shuts off the water and lets the dish rest in the sink
she turns to ellis
im gonna turn in
mary lee slips past him and enters her bedroom
the door closes and ellis is left alone in the den
he waits looking at the door his mother just closed
ellis walks into the kitchen and eases open a cabinet door
checking over his shoulder he zips his backpack open and fills it with canned food
hands pump the stock of a high powered pellet gun
tom blankenship white hair cut high and tight wearing a short sleeve button up takes careful aim with the pellet gun
tom sits in a lawn chair atop the roof of his houseboat
he squeezes his left eye shut
a snakes head pokes out of the water about yards off his boat
the head makes for a target no bigger than a thumb
toms left eye snaps open and he fires
the pellet rips through the snakes head
its body floats to the surface
tom takes account of his shot as he pumps the air rifle
he scans the water for more targets
ellis watches tom blankenship from across the bayou
toms boat sits directly opposite ellis separated by yards of muddy brown water
ellis leans against a post under the carport
his backpack resting at his feet he holds the walkie talkie in his hand
senior works behind him washing utensils in the outdoor sink
what do you know about tom blankenship
senior doesnt turn around from his work at the sink
blankenship what do you know about him
i dont know
he looks lonely over there
some people move to this river to work on it and some move here to be left alone
senior makes his way to the ice machine and begins scooping ice into a large white cooler
mary lee emerges from the houseboat dressed for work a secretarial job
senior stops what hes doing to watch her
she walks over to ellis
lets sit down for dinner tonight okay
will you make it home by seven
she walks off the boat without a glance in seniors direction
he trails her with his eyes before going back to digging in the ice
a ellis looks back at tom
the walkie squawks out several a loud beeps
ellis crams it in his backpack and runs off the boat
senior holds a hand up but never looks up from his work
water laps at the shore of the island
ellis and neckbone drag their boat onto the muddy bank
where you think hes at
i guess we should try the boat
they head for the treeline
the boys emerge from the woods their attention focused up to the boat hovering in the tree some twenty feet above them
ellis notices the remnants of a fire on the ground
a log pushed up next to it for a seat
ellis kicks at the ash
looks like he made camp
looking up to the boat you think hes up there
i didnt know if yalld come back
the boys spin around
they survey the woods but no ones there
their eyes drift up to find mud sitting in a tree his legs dangle off a branch
whatre you doin
mud bounds down stepping from limb to trunk to the ground
its an agile move
i try to never sleep in the same place twice
what you got there
mud motions with his head to the backpack in ellis hand
ellis holds it out to him
i brought you some food
mud looks at the backpack but doesnt move
mud takes the backpack and walks over to the ashes of his campfire
he squats with his back to the boys and unzips the bag
hunkered down muds shirttail rides up over the lip of his jeans revealing a pistol at his backside
ellis sees this and motions to neckbone
the boys stand their ground cautious
i owe you boys
keeping the bag in hand mud takes a seat on the stump behind him
he pulls out a selection of canned food pumpkin pie filling evaporated milk green beans
he grabs the beans
i was gonna try runnin a trot line today
see how far thatd get me
mud removes a good sized folding knife from his pocket and makes short order of the can lid
he tips the can up letting the beans fall into his mouth
juice flows down his cheeks
id been rationin what i had
green bean never tasted so good
the can is quickly emptied juice running down muds chin
he straightens his back choking down the final swallow
he sees the boys staring at him and catches himself
i appreciate it
what you got that pistol for
mud wipes off his chin realizing the boys have been studying him
he closes the knife and tucks it in his pocket
mud gets up heads for a duffel bag tucked under a nearby tree
the boys pivot keeping mud in front of them
yall dont have to be afraid of me
i have two ways to protect myself out here
this shirt and this pistol
there are fierce powers at work in the world boys
good evil poor luck best luck
men have to take advantage where they can
mud removes a spool of fishing line and a small plastic tackle box
he scoops up the duffel bag and heads into the woods
neckbone looks to ellis who walks after mud into the trees
whos this guy youre waitin on
im not waitin for a guy
im waitin on my girlfriend
is she hot
best lookin girl ive ever seen
shes like a dream you dont want to wake up from
shes got birds tattooed on her hands here
mud stops points to the area on the top of his right hand between his thumb and pointer finger
good luck birds
that a good luck snake
no it is not
i hate snakes
thats because god made them for us to fear
its a thing we knew to be afraid of before we even got into this world
they emerge from the woods onto the downstream coast of the island
it looks different than the other shoreline
a large swath of red clay angles sharply into the water
cherokee would wrap snake skin around their pregnant womens bellies
induce labor scare the child out
he fetches a length of rope out of the duffel bag and tosses it to neckbone
set that round your bed at night
snake wont cross braided rope
nods to muds tattoo so whats that for then
mud walks to a tree branch that has grown out over the bank nearly resting in the water
he sets a trot line from it
dont get bit
i was swimmin bout a mile up from here
me and juniper
sonofabitch swam right up under me bit me just below the armpit
june got me out got me to a clinic
doctor said i shoulda been dead in twenty minutes
took us an hour just to get back to town
whatd they do
gave me antivenom
for a cotton mouth
mud shows the tattoo on top of his right hand
he points out the two cotton blossoms bulging from the snakes mouth
problem with antivenom is they can only give it to you once
its made from horse blood
your body would reject it a second time
the cure ends up being more dangerous than the poison
what happens if you get bit again
i die or just sweat it out
neckbone not buying it looks at ellis and taps his watch
we gotta go help necks uncle
you never said your name
you can call me mud
neckbone tosses the braided rope back
it lands at his feet
here you go mud
i think you need that worse than i do
ill be all right
the boys disappear back into the trees
a switch clicks on
blinding light emits from two flood lamps encased in plastic shells
the switch clicks off and the lights dim to the dull orange glow of their filaments
they look bright enough
the owner of the shop an electrician holds up a metal bar with the lamps affixed by bolts at either end
i rigged dc power up through marine batteries
makes it portable
gave you a rigging bar to set on your shoulder
so you really think thesell work under water
ellis and neckbone sit on the tailgate of galens truck
the garys electric sign hangs behind them
neckbone focuses on a carburetor in his hand
ellis stares across the street at the piggly wiggly parking lot where the roving group of teenagers have collected for the afternoon
the teenagers are up to their typical gossip and minor offenses
ellis has zeroed in on may pearl again
you start datin i bet her dadll give you a free pick up truck
i dont care about that
ellis watches as the same skinny kid from before tries to flirt with her
shes not having it
he pops her bra strap before landing the final straw a smack on her ass
she turns and swats at him
seeing this ellis is on his feet and crossing the street
whats goin on
ellis doesnt turn back
neckbone reluctantly sets the carburetor down and follows
she shoves the skinny kid but he continues laughing
ellis taps the kid on the shoulder
as he turns ellis punches him in the face
the kid completely taken off guard stumbles and trips to the ground
some older tougher looking guys see this and begin laughing at him
holy shit pryor get off your ass
pryor collects himself and gets off the ground
ego bruised he walks off mumbling
the older kids keep riding him
may pearl sizes up ellis
you didnt have to do that
he was messin with you
do i know you
neckbone waves by wagging a finger in the air
we went to junior high with you before you went to high school
how old are you
you know you just punched a senior
you think youre pretty tough
ellis shrugs not wanting to deny it
im may pearl
what else do you know
something catches neckbones attention
he cranes his neck forward to get a better look
son of a bitch
ellis breaks away from his conversation with may pearl
neckbone nods to a cheap motel called the executive inn located on the opposite side of the piggly wiggly parking lot
juniper a truly beautiful woman squeezed into tight jeans and a low cut top makes her way from the motel parking lot to the piggly wiggly
she passes in front of the cluster of teenagers
all of the boys have taken note
some cat calls from the crowd
juniper without facing the teenagers gives them the finger
you ever seen that girl before
did you see her hands
ellis catches himself and turns back to may pearl
we know a guy we think might know that girl
a girlfriend of may pearls calls out to her
i guess ill see you
if you can find my phone number you should call it
i can find it
may pearl walks over to her friend
ellis watches her go but then remembers juniper
he turns to neckbone
whered she go
into the piggly wiggly
she came from the motel
im gonna go see if its her
i gotta go check on galen
well pick you up out front
ellis heads for the piggly wiggly
neckbone calls after him
whatd she say
wants me to call her
ellis walks past the grocery aisles looking for the girl
he spots her by the potato chips
he tucks behind a display of stacked cans and watches
juniper reaches for a bag of chips birds tattooed on her hand
its her and she really is beautiful
she turns down the aisle coming right for him
he pretends to peruse the canned food and notices that its a big display of beanie weenie
he grabs two handfuls as she passes
ellis takes the cans to an open register
as a cashier scans and bags his items he cranes his neck looking for her
shes disappeared into another section of the store
ellis pays in crumpled cash
a horn honks
he sees galens truck idling out front
he grabs the bag and runs out
neckbone waits at the open passenger door
was it her
i saw the tattoos
he wasnt lyin
no he wasnt
by the time ellis makes it back home the sun has gone from the sky
he crosses the makeshift plank to board his house
home for dinner
ellis is startled by his fathers voice
senior sits in a lawn chair under the eaves of the carport
hes hidden in shadow save for a red glow from the tip of his cigarette
what you hidin for
i aint hidin
he notices senior tip back a pint of liquor and set it at his feet
ellis opens the screen door leading inside
come over here
ellis lets the door fall shut and skulks over to a beam that supports the carport
he leans into it
you know i love you
i work you hard cause life is work
you know that
your mammas been talkin bout movin in town
whats that mean
she seems set on it
wants to separate
she may ask me for a divorce
this hits ellis like a ton of bricks
he rights himself
whats that mean for me
it means enjoy the river son
enjoy it while you live on it cause this way a life isnt long for this world
game and fishs bout made certain of that
but you and me can still live out here
game and fish cant take your boat
not while youre still in it
the houseboats in your mothers name
her daddy give it to her not me
if she wants to leave it game and fish has ever right to take this boat apart board by board
but that aint right
you work outta here
we got the ice machine the traps
what are we supposed to do
like i said this is your mothers business
i aint no townie
i aint livin like that
senior takes a slow pull off the bottle
ellis mind races
ive let you down
a man should be in charge of his own affairs but i havent worked it like that
but yall are married
yall are sposed to love each other
i dont know about that anymore
ellis is speechless
after a moment he turns to go inside
he stops and turns back to his father
senior tries to express a sentiment he doesnt have the words for
ellis continues inside
mary lee sits hunched at the made dinner table
she runs her finger around the rim of a half empty glass of iced tea
its a full spread with fried chicken mashed potatoes and a salad
the table is set for two
shes been waiting
ellis lets the front door slam shut behind him
she sits up
ellis doesnt speak he doesnt look at her
he enters his room and shuts the door
hes heard the news and she knows it
mary lees face drops
ellis slings his backpack down pacing the small room
he stops and leans his forehead against the door
the sound of his mother clearing the table seeps through
he kicks the door cracking its shitty composite wood
his face flushed and his breathing heavy he slides to a seat
on the verge of hyperventilating he stares out the dark bedroom window trying to get control of his breathing
ellis looks at his backpack
it has spilled open revealing a can of beanie weenie
ellis studies the can
he looks back to the window
his breathing settles
quickly he scoops up the backpack and heads out the window
its pitch black
the only light comes from the moons reflection off the surface of the water
ellis eyes wide navigates the small boat through choppy black water
ellis struggles to pull the boat onto shore
leaving it half in the water ellis looks around
no sign of mud
he sizes up the dark woods
he removes a flashlight from his backpack and shines it down the shorelines
ellis follows the beam of light into the woods
ellis stands at the creek that cuts through the island
he can make out a campfire glowing through trees in the distance
a rustling behind him
he swings the light around
nothing but trees
ellis takes a deep breath
finding the log to cross he shines his light down into the creek
the nest of snakes show their backs
a campfire burns at the base of the tree
the firelight illuminates the belly of the boat that rests feet above
ellis his flashlight off crouches behind a tree and watches the campsite
there is no one there
he looks into the black forest behind him thinks of going back
a twig snaps in the distance and hes back on guard
ellis nervously scans the woods before finally stepping into the light of the campfire
the sound of a guns hammer drawing back clicks behind him
mud emerges from the trees a
extended toward ellis back
ellis still frozen slowly turns to him
mud huffs out a laugh and drops the pistol to his side
whatre you doin out here
ellis slowly raises the backpack in his hand
i got you some beanie weenie
mud tucks the pistol into his jeans and accepts the backpack
i appreciate that but i didnt expect you out here at night
mud takes a seat on the log and transfers the cans into his own duffel bag
he holds up a can of the beanie weenie
look at that
you really know how to do somebody right
i didnt wanna say anything before but its hard to make a meal out of pumpkin pie filling
thats all my mom had
im not complainin
can i get one of those
theyre yours to begin with
ellis sits as mud hands him a can
i missed my dinner
thats good right
you been out here too long
finishing the can he takes a half smoked cigarette from his shirt pocket
he pulls a twig from the fire for a light
the girl youre waitin on shes your girlfriend
howd you meet her
we grew up together
do you love her
the first time i saw her was on this river
just up from here
she saved my life
from the snake bite
i was younger than you are now but when i came to in the hospital and she was there it was like the world split open came back together new
i knew from then on id do anything for her
why arent yall married
marriage just doesnt work for some people
ellis thinks on this
my dad says my parents may be gettin a divorce
im sorry to hear that
if it happens and my mom moves us off the river they say the government can come take our boat away
who says that
they passed a law so you cant sell your boat
cant rent it
if the owner leaves they got you
game and fish want em off the river
ive never been one to trust the government on matters of personal property but if your parents love each other theres always a chance
people just sometimes forget why they fell in love in the first place
ellis watches mud toke the cigarette nub
hes really getting all he can from it
i saw juniper today
i didnt talk to her but she had the birds tattooed on her hand like you said
you were right
mud stands surprised by the news
he walks to the other side of the fire so his back is to the boy
whered you see her
at the piggly wiggly
i think shes stayin at a motel by there
the executive inn
mud looks at ellis through the fire
he takes a drag and smiles at the boy
the hole from his missing tooth shows
thats good news
real good news
mud paces slowly
does she know youre out here
we picked another place to meet
couple days from now
mud walks back to the log and sits
you wanna go tonight
i can give you a ride up river
mud looks at ellis nodding
ill go tomorrow
you need me to come get you
i can manage
hell i got out here didnt i
they sit in silence
ellis stares up at the boat hanging over them its peeling hull lit by the firelight
mud pinches the ash from the end of his cigarette places the stub back in his shirt pocket
noticing ellis mud tilts his head back to take in the boat
its a helluva thing
mud pauses his mind working on something
the two sit by the campfire staring up at the suspended boat
mary lee knocks on her way into the bedroom
time to get up
she begins picking clothes off the floor
ellis in bed raises up on his elbows
hes tired from a late night
im going to wal mart
i need you to come with me
she pulls the covers off of him
the two ride in an awkward silence
ellis stares at the farmland passing by outside as mary lee steers the compact toyota down a four lane interstate
ellis i know what your father told you last night
thats not what i wanted
i wanted to sit you down and talk about it
what do you wanna talk about
you want to leave and that means they can tear up our house
ive spent my whole life on that boat
i dont think its too much to ask for your
mary lee is interrupted by a line of traffic backed up in front of her
she slows to a stop
i hope no ones hurt
there are flashing police lights up ahead
ellis tries to see whats going on but cant make anything out past the line of cars
they inch forward
im just saying there are two sides to this
i havent made up my mind about anything because i want you to be involved in my decision but i need a change ellis
i deserve one
as they approach the flashing lights they see three state trooper vehicles parked to funnel traffic down to one lane
the state troopers stop each car checking the trunks
i think theyre searching people
a trooper signals mary lee to pull up to a stop
two other troopers approach her vehicle
the first begins looking in her back windows as the second leans down to speak to her
she lowers her window
can you open the trunk please maam
mary lee pulls the lever by her knee and the second trooper walks around the back of the car
have you picked up or seen any hitchhikers today maam
the trooper produces a flier with a color photo on it
have you seen this man
the trooper leans over and holds the paper out to ellis
son have you seen this man
ellis looks at the photo
its of mud
he looks exactly the same as he did last night down to the shirt
in the photo muds smiling revealing his missing tooth
weve had reports that hes in this area
if you see him call immediately
we will officer
the trooper pulls his head from the window
whatd he do
the trooper bends back down and looks at ellis
whatd he do
move along please
mary lee pulls forward and speeds back up on the interstate
rolls up her window
how would you feel about moving into town with me
please dont tell your father this but ive been looking at a couple of places
i know it would be a big adjustment for you but it might end up being something you like
you know living on the river isnt exactly everyones idea of the good life
he looks at her
are you even listening to me
ellis busts through the door grabs his backpack and is gone
ellis is off the houseboat and running up the bank
he heads down the dirt path grabbing the walkie talkie out of his backpack
into the walkie neck
neck pick up
ellis removes branches and readies the flat bottom boat to launch
the sound of neckbones bike arrives before he does
neckbone crests the sand covered slope
he dismounts and starts to chain the bike up to a tree trunk
so whats the big deal
my mom and i were headed to wal mart on
there was a roadblock with state troopers
they searched our car and showed us a picture of mud
theyre lookin for him
i knew it
i told you that crazy sonofabitch was trouble
did they say what he did
sod you tell em where he is
thats why i called you
we gotta warn him
hes goin to get juniper today
i went out there last night and told him where we saw her
he needs to know people are lookin for him
you think he doesnt know that already
jesus ellis why do you think hes on that island
you dont even know what hes wanted for
ellis climbs in the boat and neckbone yanks his shoulder
we dont know who this guy is
he loves her neck
he told me
i dont give a shit who he loves
ellis starts the motor and waits for his friend
hes not dangerous
reluctantly neckbone throws his leg into the boat
it sounds like a shitload of state troopers think different
ellis and neckbone emerge from the woods at muds campsite
they scan nearby tree limbs
no tellin where the hell hes been sleepin
he may already be gone
the boys look straight up
mud leans over the edge of the boat above them
mud drops them a rope with knots tied in it
ellis starts inching his way up
neckbone begrudgingly follows
ellis pulls himself over the edge of the boat
he finds mud sitting in the swivel chair behind the steering wheel
he writes in an open spiral notebook with a black sharpie
what are you doin
im gonna have to go back on our deal for the boat
i dont feel good about it but i dont see any other way outta what im into
neckbone makes his way on board
mud has pulled a panel off the steering column
exposed wires dangle
so you know about the state troopers
he looks up from his notebook
what state troopers
the ones spreadin your picture all over the place
stoppin cars on searchin for your ass
mud factors this in and then goes back to writing
i didnt know about that but it doesnt surprise me
there plenty of folks lookin for me right now
i shot a man
mud stands and walks to the back of the boat
the boys eyes follow him cautiously
mud lifts a hatch at the back that would typically house the batteries and engine wiring
theres nothing left but a hole into the trees
he makes a note
im sorry i didnt tell yall sooner but i was hopin to be gone before anything came of it
didnt want you involved
mud turns to really face them for the first time
yall have been real good to me
youre the only friends i got out here
if the state troopers have blocked theyll have others blocked too
i wont get anywhere in a car
i want to try takin this boat down see if we can get it in the water
ellis and neckbone stand their ground
they dont say anything
mud walks back to the steering column
he drops to his knees and fiddles with the wires
with a boat like this i can make it to the gulf in two days
i could get anywhere from there
but id need a boat at least this big to make it on open water
its got no title no owner nobody lookin for it
its my best shot
whod you kill
it was a bad piece of business
yall dont need to hear about it
i need to hear about it
mud sits up
he looks at ellis deciding how much to tell
juniper made a mistake
she hooked up with a guy
he was no good
his name was hutchins
family owns a chain of restaurants down in texas
where were you
i was around but me and juniper were on the outs
she met this hutchins he sold her on some lies
got her pregnant
thats when he started showin who he really was
he dropped june down a flight of stairs after whoopin her half to death
she lost the baby
he made it so the doctors think she cant have children anymore
therere things you can get away with in this world and things you cant
i tracked him down at a motel just outside of san antonio
he was there with another woman
thats where it happened
muds done with his story
he goes back to the wiring
i understand if you cant help me anymore but i need this boat
and i need to get it in the water fast
after a moment he sits up and wipes sweat from his forehead
ive made a list
things well need
what do yall think
ellis takes time to consider everything
he looks at neckbone who has a disgruntled look on his face
you did it for her
to protect her
mud looks over at neckbone who still has the disgruntled look on his face
what do you think
i think you want us to run around stickin our necks out gettin everything you need just so you can take our boat
thats about it
mud removes a cigarette butt and sparks it with a lighter
what do we get out of it
what do you want
neckbone looks to ellis judging his bargaining position
what about that pistol
mud eyes the boy pulling on the nub of cigarette
i only got two things out here worth anything
mud pulls the pistol from the back of his jeans
neckbone tenses but relaxes when mud splays it out on an open palm
and this pistol
i cant give you the shirt cause i need it for protection but if you help me get this boat in the water the pistols yours
neckbone squinches his face in thought sizing up this trade
what kind is it
a forty five
i guess we could work a deal like that
neckbone steps forward to grab the pistol but mud puts it back in his jeans
we get this thing floatin first
neckbone looks over at ellis who shrugs
all right then
mud smiles flashing his missing tooth
he spits in his palm and holds it out to neckbone
neckbone not sure about taking the spit hand reluctantly shakes
mud rips a page from the notebook and hands it to ellis
yall scrounge what you can off this list but if were gonna get this done right well need more help
can you fetch tom for me
mud has smoked down to the filter
he crushes the butt into his palm and puts it back in his shirt pocket
i was hopin to let that old assassin stay put but well need him to get things yall cant
can you find him
i know where he lives but ive never spoke to him
just tell him my name
hell know youre serious
ellis folds the list up
he and neckbone start down the rope as mud goes back to the wiring
dont lose my pistol
they continue down the rope
mud continues his work
ellis steers to the southern mouth of shellys oxbow the bend in the river that holds he and tom blankenships houseboats among others
he grounds the boat just shy of entering the oxbow and steps over neckbone to hop onto the bank
ill watch the boat
ellis scans the woods that populate the patch of land wedged between the river and this short tributary
galen always said that old mans crazy
neckbone keeps his seat as ellis darts into the woods ellis prowls around the small pine trees and bushes
he pauses seeing the entrance to tom blankenships boat
something moves on the houseboat
ellis hunkers down behind a bush
he sees tom wrapping cable onto a metal spool
ellis is nervous
he checks over his shoulder nothing but woods
when he looks back to the boat tom is gone
in a crouch ellis moves closer
taking a deep breath ellis steps out from the cover of the pine trees and heads up a walkway that leads onboard
why you huntin me
he turns to find tom blankenship standing at the edge of the boat
you deaf boy
i said whyre you huntin me
i aint huntin you
whats your business here
i came to find you
i got a message for you
youre seniors boy
what you got to say he cant tell me himself
tom rusty on pleasantries brushes past ellis as he heads inside the boat
it aint from him
ellis not wanting to follow further shouts from the planks
there is a silence
mud sent you
what do you know about it
he asked me to come get you
tom straightens his back
he looks into the woods searching for something he may have missed
your daddy know this
mud needs your help
toms mind churns on a series of facts unknown to the boy
where is he
neckbone bounces in the boat as it shifts in the choppy mississippi water
his eyes are locked on the back of toms head
tom rides stone faced in the front
neckbone turns back to ellis and raises his eyebrows as if to ask whats going on
ellis runs the boat on shore
tom splashes into the ankle deep water and helps the boys drag it onto the bank
ellis takes the lead walking ahead and scanning the treeline
mud steps out just past the shadow of the woods
ellis turns to tom and points
there he is
tom spits onto the muddy bank and makes his way toward mud
ellis and neckbone stay by the boat and watch
mud watches tom approaching
he corrects his posture and feebly attempts to smooth some wrinkles from his shirt
tom stops in front of him his eyes pinched in the sun
they stare at each other for a long moment
neither one flinching
at this distance the boys cant hear what is being said but they try and size up the situation through body language
you think thats his dad
i dont know
where is she
got here yesterday
tom lowers his head
why you out here like this
the boys see mud take a seat on a nearby stump
hes explaining something
tom listens standing over him
they dont look like family
ellis watches mud as he gestures and speaks
he seems different
mud stops talking
tom scratches a hand through his white crew cut
he begins pointing a finger at mud
his face is flushed and the sound of his voice carries to the boys though still unintelligible
hes really givin it to him
muds head hangs as tom shouts at him
youve spent your whole life followin that girl
shes run you halfway cross the country and back and for what
for this left out on an island beggin for help
i aint no thief
what would you call it then
dont even mention draggin those boys into this
do you have any idea what youre doin
waits for a response but mud gives none
im ashamed of you
mud looks up at him
dont expect help from me
theres none to be given
they see tom turn his back on mud and head toward the boat
mud doesnt protest he doesnt move
tom brushes past ellis
tom shoves the boat back into the water
neckbone helps him
ellis looks back at mud who still hasnt moved from his stump
he goes to him
tom sees this and stops pushing
ellis stops a good six feet back from where mud sits
you all right
mud raises his head
looks like were on our own
he stands and takes a folded piece of paper from his shirt
i didnt want you bein the one to do this but i cant see a way around it
i need to get this letter to juniper
could you take it to her for me
you have to be careful
you cant just walk up and knock on her door you hear me
you have to watch yourself
i can handle it
ellis steps forward and mud hands over the note
ellis takes it and walks back to the others
tom stares at ellis as he climbs on board
tom looks back at mud who is watching him
he gives the boat a final shove before pulling himself in
they motor away
tom doesnt look back
you muds daddy
mud didnt have no daddy
no mother i ever knew of
he was livin in the woods when i met him
younger than you are now
tom doesnt offer anymore
neckbone thinks on his answer
ellis kills the engine near the mouth of shellys oxbow
tom jumps down into the knee deep river and wades onto shore
he turns back to the boys
yall need to watch yourselves
dont go gettin into something you dont have any business in
muds into something you dont want any part of
i suggest you forget about him
ellis and neckbone dont respond
tom with a final admonishing look disappears into the woods
ellis cranks the motor and points the boat up river
edges of the notebook paper flap in the wind
neckbone reads muds letter to juniper
ellis reaches the bank where they stash their boat
he shuts off the motor and lets them drift
neckbone folds the letter back up and turns to face ellis
what do you think
he loves her
you can tell that much
you gonna take it to her
i told him i would
neckbone thinks about this seriously shakes his head
i dont know
could be a lot of trouble
you still got that trailer you made for your bike
neckbone rides with ellis on the back of his dirt bike
cars and trucks honk and zip by them
their speed is topped out at about miles per hour
mostly a result of the small x metal trailer they are towing behind the bike
one of seniors white fish coolers sits in the trailer
parked in the far corner of the lot ellis sits on top of the white cooler eyeing the executive inn
neckbone straddles the dirt bike
a handful of cars are parked at the motel an old honda a pick up and a black lincoln
i say we start at the top work our way down
they each grab an end of the cooler and carry it across the lot toward a flight of stairs
the boys set the cooler down in front of the first room on the corner
ellis checks over his shoulder nothing strange
they pick the cooler up and walk to the next door
after a moment a black man in his late sixties opens the door wearing boxers and an undershirt
what you want
were sellin fish
you wanna buy some
he looks at the two boys like they are insane
i dont want no damn fish
he slams the door
they drag the cooler to the next door
as ellis holds up his fist to knock they hear a woman shouting a few doors down
ellis heads for the room
neckbone drags the cooler after him
ellis reaches the motel room door which has been left ajar
he places his hand on it and lets it fall open
the door opens to carver a tall slender man in a dark western cut suit standing over juniper
shes crumpled up in a ball at the end of the bed
carver swats open handed at her head
grabs the top of her hair
you hear me bitch
tell me another lie
ellis rushes carver with his shoulder as if he were breaking down a door
carver is knocked off balance
he trips over the edge of the bed and crashes into the motel room wall
carver slightly stunned gets to his feet and in two broad steps lands a man sized punch across ellis face
he grabs the boy up by the scruff of his shirt
who are you
who the hell are you
did he send you
carver removes a piece of paper from his pocket
its a photo copied picture of mud different than the state troopers
carver crams the photo in the boys face
you know this man
look at him
do you know him
blood trickles from a cut under ellis eye
he stutters under the shaking force of carvers hands
neckbone is yelling at the top of his lungs almost in a girls pitch
carver turns to him
the cooler is open behind them and neckbone holds up two ziplock bags of fish
were just selling fish
carver sizes things up
it takes a moment but he settles
he snorts out a laugh and drops ellis on the ground
carver turns his attention back to juniper who is huddled up in the corner of the motel
carver walks over to her
opening a good sized knife he gets down in her face and holds the blade uncomfortably close to her cheek
i know you know where he is
and i swear to god ill cut through every one a you to find him
standing carver folds up his knife
we know you came here for him and we know hes too stupid to leave you behind
so when he pops his head out of whatever shithole hes staying in ill be there
you tell him that
carver turns stepping over ellis on his way out
and you need to mind your business boy
neckbone moves from the doorway to let him pass
carver is gone
neckbone shuts the door and fastens the security latch
he kneels down to check on his friend
you all right
he popped your eye
ellis holds the back of his hand up to his eye which has begun to swell
the cut trickles blood over his cheekbone
juniper moves to the sink
ellis sits up staring at her back
she opens an ice bucket and wraps a handful of cubes in a towel
she turns and walks over to them her eyes cast down
she kneels in front of ellis making eye contact for the first time
she touches his chin gently pivoting it to see the wound
her eyes are glassy
he stares back at her
he cant take his eyes off her
she holds the iced towel to his cheek
he doesnt even flinch
im so sorry
tears form and run down her cheeks
she takes his hand and places it against the towel
she gets to her feet and pulls a pocket book from a bag in the corner
how much is your fish
ill buy the cooler full
ellis motions neckbone to the cooler
neckbone goes over and crams his hand into the ice
he removes a ziplock bag containing the note that mud sent
neckbone hands it to ellis
taking the note he sets his ice down and walks over to juniper
mud sent us to give this to you
juniper is stunned
she looks at the bag then at the boys
youve met mud
neckbone speaks up from the back
yeah we met him
juniper takes the bag
she removes the letter and takes a seat on the edge of the bed to read it
ellis watches her eyes move along the paper
she smiles which makes ellis smile
after a moment she folds it up
he tells me to hold tight
yeah we read it
juniper raises her eyebrows at neckbone
well do you know how long hold tight is
i think its a couple days
he wants to get a boat for yall
juniper shakes her head and goes to the sink
she pulls a lighter from her jeans pocket and torches muds note
tell him ill wait
running water over the ashes she turns back to them
but i dont want yall involved
tell him what i said and make that it
i dont want you gettin in any trouble
what do you call that
she motions to his swelling eye
well be all right
keep your door locked
well be in touch
ellis heads to the door as neckbone gathers up the cooler
ellis turns back
whats your name
juniper walks up to ellis and puts her hands on his shoulders
she has to bend slightly to do it but she kisses him just above his swollen eye
thank you ellis
ellis stares at her infatuated
we gotta go
ellis turns and grabs one end of the cooler
neckbone slaps back the security latch and opens the door with his free hand
they walk out
ellis his foot on the door looks back at juniper
lock the door
the door slams shut
the room number stares ellis in the face
he takes a deep breath
lets go hard on
he and ellis wrangle the cooler down the steps
the sun set while they were inside
a blue hue hangs over everything
carver takes a drag off a cigarette from behind the steering wheel of his black lincoln town car conscious to blow any smoke out the open drivers window
his car wedged between two others in the piggly wiggly parking lot is pointed toward the executive inn
he watches as ellis and neckbone load the cooler onto neckbones bike
ellis enters his houseboat
he sees a note on the counter next to a can of soup
it reads ive gone to a movie
warm up some soup for dinner
ellis picks up the can not thrilled
he goes to the fridge and grabs a sack of peas from the freezer
holding the peas against his eye he takes a seat at the counter and flips through a phone book
he finds what he needs and dials a corded phone
is may pearl there
this is ellis
hey its ellis
in the phone book
from his car commercials
i think theyre all right
yeah i can meet you
ellis hangs up the phone
with the peas pressed firmly against his face he smirks
neckbones sneaker busts through a rotten plank of wood
inside a decrepit wooden shack ellis gives neckbone a look like hes a dumbass as they proceed to take the shack apart board by board
ellis now has a full on black eye
a neckbone stands lookout under the carport section of ellis a houseboat
the coast clear he gives ellis a nod
ellis pops open a metal locker and removes a small chainsaw and container of gas
he loads these into an empty fish cooler
b tom sitting atop his houseboat with his pellet gun watchesb as the two boys sneak the tools away
c at neckbones mobile home park ellis heaves loops of thick c rope onto their mini dirt bike trailer
neckbone stands nearby laughing with the ropes owner a lanky guy with brown teeth and a tasmanian devil tattoo on his neck
ac ellis hoists neckbone up by the foot allowing him to ac unscrew a road sign
d a mop soaked in black tar slops across the flat roof of the d furniture store in downtown dewitt
neckbone and ellis stand in the stores parking lot yelling up to the roofers
they get ones attention and neckbone points to a dried pile of leftover tar that has been dumped at the back of the building
the roofer swats a hand at the boys
they proceed to load the dried hunk onto the small trailer
e from a distance neckbone and ellis stand on a sailboat in e the middle of a fenced in marine junkyard
surrounded by old boat parts the boys begin shuttling several large metal pulleys off the sailboat
mud smiles showing his missing tooth as he looks over the load of items the boys have stacked in their boat
neckbone tosses a loop of rope to him
weve got more but no motor
thisll work for now
you get her my note
ellis turns and mud sees his black eye for the first time
whered you get that from
we came up on junipers room
a guy was in there beatin up on her
muds face turns dark
ellis rushed him
got smacked for it
whatd he look like
i dont know
looked like a cowboy
mud slings the rope to the ground and kicks it
his face is flushed
its the first time the boys have seen him angry
the boys back up
mud takes a deep breath tries to cool down
it takes a moment then something occurs to him
he eyes ellis with a look of genuine gratitude
thanks for lookin after her
mud picks up the rope
his names carver
brother of the man i shot
if hes here then more are comin
mud gathers the supplies and heads to the treeline
the boys with their hands full follow him
carvers rotten but his daddys the one to be scared of
hell spend all the money he has to see me dead
if it was up to me id put the whole family down same as the other
not a decent man between em
mud stops and turns to lay a serious look on them
yall listen to me now
if you see that old man dont get near him
hes the triple six real deal scratch you hear me
mud waits for nods from them both
galen drifts in his own boat out on the mississippi river
he stares at something in the distance
he sees neckbone and ellis on the island walking with mud
galen a concerned look on his face keeps one hand on his motor and the other on a bulging net of mussel shells
his helper a salty looking man in his fifties sits at the front of the boat sipping budweiser from the can
what you waitin for
after a moment galen cranks the motor and speeds away
mud stands with ellis and neckbone on the deck of the boat
he holds a pulley in one hand and a length of rope in the other
he stares up into the trees
ellis can you climb up that trunk and get these hung
take a foot of line and tie em off with a bowline knot
you know it
im not stupid
ellis takes the pulley and scales the trunk without hesitation
mud tosses his pocket knife to neckbone
neck start cuttin line
three fifteen foot sections
count a foot long as your arm
mud begins threading the pulleys with rope
as neckbone cuts rope he sees the pistol stuck in the back of muds pants
whats so special bout that shirt youd lose your pistol for it
its got a wolfs eye sewn in the sleeve
more protection than a bullet ever gave
tom swears by it
he said he wasnt your daddy
toms the closest thing i ever knew to a father
i never met my parents
its hard not knowin the ones you came from
my uncle galen tells me things about em
hes the one that takes care of me
tom did that for me
ellis drops down to the deck and grabs another pulley
whatd you mean when you called tom an assassin
toms had lives youd never know about
grew up up north
went to yale
for a long time he was a paid killer for the c
lived in cuba in
hes probably killed more people than youve met
hand me that line
neckbone tosses him an end of rope looks to ellis
ellis gives a shrug before heading back up the trunk
mud hangs off the tree fifteen feet up by a piece of rope tied around his waist
a series of ropes and pulleys crisscross from the boat to the trees
neckbone and ellis stand on the ground staring up at him
mud holds a chainsaw and seems to be hesitating
well if youre gonna do it do it
mud takes a deep breath and yanks the cord
angled on one of the main branches holding up the boat mud begins cutting
ellis and neckbone step further and further back as they watch the chainsaw work through the thick limb
suddenly the chainsaw stops
a deep cracking sound
the huge branch snaps tumbling off lower limbs before crashing to the ground
mud holds onto the trunk for dear life
the branch now rests on the ground silence
the ropes and pulleys hang taught squeaking from the weight of the boat
mud slowly lifts his head up
he smiles at what he sees
the rigging has held
neckbone and ellis watch as mud scampers around the trunk to the next branch
the chainsaw cranks back on
this shit is crazy
ellis looks out the car window at high school kids that have gathered in the piggly wiggly parking lot
his hair is slicked to one side and hes wearing a collared shirt
you look nice
what time are you gonna be home
she looks at him as the car radio rambles
no later than eleven
you make up your mind
about moving in town
about leavin dad
mary lee thinks about how to answer shuts off the radio
you cant make other people change ellis
if im unhappy then ill have to be the one to change something
ellis chews on the inside of his cheek and watches her avoid eye contact
he shoulders his way out of the car
mary lee takes a moment before driving off
as mary lee pulls away ellis takes in the scene
he looks up at junipers motel room and sees her leaning on the railing smoking a cigarette
she doesnt see him
he pauses noticing a man to his left who also stares up at juniper
the man early thirties with a thick mustache is james
he leans against the grill of a black lincoln
carver appears from inside the piggly wiggly
he holds a cup of coffee and is closely trailed by a fat little man nelson
theyre all dressed in a similar fashion a cross between rural farmers and rodeo stars
as carver approaches the lincoln he scolds james for leaning on the grill
carver rubs the hood with his coat sleeve and gives orders to the men
ellis turns to see may pearl hopping down from a ford bronco
she leans on the door and waves ellis into the back
ellis takes another look at carver and his men before running over to the bronco
a bonfire rages in the middle of an open field
a few dozen kids mingle between vehicles and the fire
drinking yelling music blasting from car speakers
ellis stands by himself next to the blaze with his hands in his pockets
may pearl has vanished
pryor the skinny kid ellis punched to get this date wanders past
he makes eye contact
ellis stares him down
pryor glares back but then just skulks over to another group
a styrofoam sonic cup is thrust into ellis hand
he turns to find may pearl standing next to him
she leads ellis behind one of the trucks parked nearby
may pearl climbs onto the tailgate a red glow across her face
no one else is around
you wanna sit down
ellis takes a seat next to her
she looks at him smiling and gestures to his black eye
you must really like to fight
ellis takes a sip from the sonic cup
his face puckers
but youre not scared if you have to
you got a lot of friends
theyre all right
i dont know all of em
i bet youre pretty popular
why do you say that
i dont know
cause youre nice to people
how do you know that
youre nice to me
but i like you
ellis digs into his jeans pocket
i got this for you
he removes a bracelet made from the pearls he collected off galens porch
may pearl takes it begins putting it on
neckbones uncle caught the pearls
i thought with your name and everything
she leans over hugging him with a kiss on the cheek
she stays close
you wanna be my girlfriend
she smiles then kisses him
morning fog sits on top of the water around ellis houseboat
ellis steps outside and makes his way to the ice machine
a loud whistle comes from across the oxbow
ellis walks to the edge of the garage
a he sees tom blankenship seated on the roof of his houseboat
a he motions ellis over
ellis watches him unsure of what to do
tom motions to him again
ellis looks back at the house
no sign of his parents
he shoots a glance back at tom
ellis bumps his fathers boat against the side of toms houseboat
he steps up onto the deck and ties off
tom down from the roof stands by his front door
you want some coffee
tom disappears inside
i dont drink coffee
ellis waits for a moment but realizes this is toms way of inviting him inside
this houseboat although similar in size is different than ellis
its an actual wood shack that has been constructed atop a barge
ellis looks at photos books and memorabilia that cram the walls and shelves
it feels homey
tom his back to the boy stands in the kitchen area pouring a cup of coffee
you been seein mud
a collection of framed photos on a desk catches ellis attention
a young tom with a pretty dark skinned girl
they seem happy
another photo late s of tom standing alone in a suit
he holds a long suitcase
tom enters holding two cups of coffee
you dont have to lie to me boy
he hands ellis a cup of coffee with a cartoon image of a dog on it
it reads im a real bitch in the morning
tom sits in a lazyboy that he gently rocks in
ive seen you runnin around
he all right
he get that boat down
there is an awkward moment
he called you an assassin
tom snorts out a laugh sips his coffee
is it true
how long have you known mud
well thats long enough to know hes full of shit
so its not true
i was a sharpshooter in the army
in muds world that makes me an assassin
not exactly true right
yeah i guess
tom notices the boys disappointment
you think hes a bad ass dont you
i dont know
you know why hes stuck out on that island
he shot somebody
he tell you why he shot that man
because he hurt juniper
the real reason muds in the trouble hes got is because of her
hes been in love with that girl since he was your age
they used to run all around here and it was the same back then
hed follow that girl wherever she led him
problem is she dont care about nobody but herself
ive told him as much
shed bed down with the meanest snake she could find then when things went bad shed go runnin to mud
mud would take her back then go find whatever unlucky sonofabitch last put a hand on her and beat em til they knew to never touch her again
and this time i guess he thought a beating wasnt good enough
had to shoot that fella
i dont know for sure but id put money on juniper knowin hed do it
and i have a suspicion she might of even told him to
either way those two are set for failure
only chance mud has is to cut her loose
cause ill tell you what muds no bad ass
hes runnin scared
ellis cant look tom in the eye hes offended by the old mans remarks
ellis sets the coffee cup on the desk
i gotta go
ellis heads for the door but stops short
youre wrong about juniper
they love each other and theyre gonna make it
if you werent a wore out old man youd know it was true
tom eyes the boy taking a sip from his cup
he nods a goodbye to ellis who is already out the door
ellis stomps out of the trees and is struck by the new position of the boat
it hangs three feet off the ground suspended in dry dock
a clear cut path of trees leads off toward the islands southern shore
beside the boat remnants of a giant fire smolder
ellis surveys the mound of ash
what you say ellis
ellis turns to find mud standing on the deck of the boat holding a fistful of wires
he jumps down
i got more stuff
you find a motor
points to the ash whats that
i made a bonfire
mud enters the woods
bonfires an all purpose cure all for bad luck
i dont know where this boats been or what kind of person had it before me
for all i know it could have some serious bad business left on it
we got too much ridin on this thing to leave to chance
helpin his uncle with a dive
mud and ellis exit the treeline heading to ellis boat
tom called me over to his place this mornin
what he say
he was runnin down juniper
ellis looks for a response but mud just jumps up into the boat and starts throwing pieces of wood on shore
i told him he was a wore out old man
told him he couldnt know how much you loved juniper
you dont know his story
i dont care
tom loved a woman more than most men could in two lifetimes
they had a good life started together
mud hops down and scoops a load of wood into his arms
she was pregnant with a little boy but the birth got the better of em
they didnt make it
toms been alone ever since
mud has begun walking back to the treeline
i gotta go help my dad
mud turns back but doesnt stop moving
thanks for the wood ellis
ellis watches him go thinking on what he said
fully suited in diving gear galen toils in the murky brown water at the bottom of the river
his gear consists of a typical wet suit wet socks but no gloves
his metal helmet is not typical
its welded from half a hot water heater thats been fitted with barbell weights
a hose connected to the top runs to the surface
galen ties off a netted sack and yanks on its line
a small air compressor chugs as neckbone stands in the middle of galens boat pulling in the heavy rope
at the end the net bulging with mussel shells appears
he manages to roll the heavy load into the boat before moving over to a crank handle that feeds another line
after several cranks galens steel helmet breaches the surface
he places his hands on the edge of the boat as neckbone removes the barbell weights
the weight removed neckbone takes off the helmet
galen pulls himself into the boat out of breath
this shit never gets easy
thats a good haul
ive had worse
galen reclines as neckbone kills the air compressor and begins organizing the gear
he watches his little nephew
you doin all right
you dont need to tell me anything
tell you what
i know im just your uncle not much of a parent
but you can tell me things if you need to
i can tell you this helmet smells like my duck butter
ellis holds a wrought iron door open with his backside as an elderly woman takes the paper bag of fish from his hands
ellis walks back to the truck
senior watches him looking at the black eye
ellis rides up front with senior
windows down no radio
whered you get that black eye
a kid in town
he got his too
what you fightin for
bout a girl
you got a girlfriend
whend that happen
senior pats his shirt pocket and finds a smoke
you seen your mother today
you not talkin to me
im talkin to both of you
thats all yall want to do is talk
well thats your mother
would rather tongue lash a problem than step up and handle it
youll see one day
women are tough
theyll set you up for things
you cant trust love ellis
if youre not careful itll run out on you
you just gotta pick a woman and roll the dice
hope you dont wake up in fifteen years hatin each other
ellis keeps staring out the window as they pull into the parking lot of the catfish parlour restaurant
senior climbs out of the truck and enters the restaurant
ellis pops open the tailgate and reaches for a cooler
the catfish parlour is one business in a strip center row
there is nothing else around save for farmland and a motel across the road
ellis notices carvers black lincoln parked in the motel lot
he walks away from the truck to get a better look
ellis scans the four other vehicles in the lot
all texas plates
a maroon cadillac sails past and turns into the motel
ellis recedes to the rear of his truck
he watches as king a fireplug of a man emerges from the cadillac
cramped from a long drive he stretches and eyes the sign for the pines motel
a motel room door opens and carver walks out
hes smiling and calls out to king
they hug as a green pick up pulls up
miller a slick dressed man in black boots climbs out
ellis snaps around to find senior leaning out the restaurant door
ellis yanks the cooler down and drags it inside
he looks back over his shoulder for a final glance at the men
daddy this is miller
hes one of ours
how do you do
appreciate your help
well be in in a minute
miller nods and enters the motel room
king turns to carver
catch me up
they work in shifts
two outside her motel the others either out searching or sleepin here
i met with the county sheriff but he wasnt much help
said theyd handle their own business but i got two of their people on payroll and a person on the inside at the state police
who alls here
all but two now
nelson and james are watchin her place
i called the rest in
lets meet the men
carver leads his father to the motel room
carver holds the door open as king steps inside
a door to his left connects another room which is empty
an episode of the smurfs plays on the television
theres a man on each of the queen beds
another three playing cards at a small table by the window
miller stands in the corner smoking
empty budweiser cans litter the room
king unimpressed by the scene looks at his son
carver quickly moves in front of the television and turns it off
he stares down the men on the beds
to the others yall pay attention
the men get up from the beds and the others put down their cards
everyone slowly gathers into an audience
this is my father king
he runs the show
carver recedes as king steps forward
he speaks like a high school football coach
i wanna thank you for the work youre doin
its important work and i want you to know what it means to me personally
im grateful for it
no man should have to bury his son
its not natural and its a pain i hope none of you ever have to endure
king removes a photocopied picture of mud from his pocket
he unfolds it stares at it then raises it to the men
this man did that to me
he took my youngest boy
and now youre gonna help me get him
king stares at the men keeping the photo held high
now gather round
come on now in a circle
i want yall to join hands
they do it reluctantly
everybody take a knee
king joins them on his knee and grabs carver and another mans hands
bow your heads
i need you to help me pray for the death of the man that killed my son
they all bow their heads
a tarp is thrown back from a rusting boat trailer
ellis and neckbone stand by the trailer looking less than thrilled
its covered in junk and debris
you touch her breast
thats great man
ellis walks up and knocks a stack of bricks off the trailer
we could take it apart
bring it out piece by piece
wed just tear it up
what if we float it out
neckbone walks to the trailer
the boys open the front door and are met by a blinding light
they squint and shield their eyes
the light shuts off as quickly as it came on
galen stands in front of them wearing his wet suit
the bar with the flood lights attached sits across his shoulders
the boys rub their eyeballs seeing spots
galen shuffles over to the couch holding a marine battery connected to the lights
he labors to take a seat
what do you think
thats real good galen
gimme a minute
neckbone still blinking goes back to his room
ellis notices galen staring at him
galen pats the couch
come ere ellis
ellis takes a seat on the other end of the couch
galen pats the spot next to him
ellis scoots over uncomfortable
you see that ceiling fan
i found it in the river
best ceiling fan ive ever owned
this river brings a lotta trash down it
some a that trash is worth a lotta money some of its not
you gotta know whats worth keepin and whats worth lettin go
you know the difference
i think so
neck looks up to you
dont get my nephew into anything you cant get him out of
galen forces a stare with ellis who nods
neckbone enters as galen begins to remove his light rig
help me rhondas just about a guy needing to get a piece to get over a girl that put one over on him
so you get your heart broke dont walk around with a shit look on your face
get back in there
get your tip wet
you hear me
you know what im sayin
galen moves to an electric guitar leaning by a small amp in the corner
yall wanna hang out
alans comin over
were gonna pump it up
we got stuff to do
the boys exit as galen turns on the amp
galen pumps it up inside as neckbone and ellis walk to the boat trailer
neckbone pulls a handful of long zip ties from his back pocket
what were yall talkin about
i dont know
muds knife slices through a plastic zip tie
thats what they call him
a boat trailer rests atop four gallon bright yellow barrels affixed with plastic zip ties
the make shift raft is half on shore with the back still floating in the water
the boys watch as mud walks around the trailer cutting off the zip ties
the barrels kick out from underneath the trailer as this happens
hes their father
you didnt go near him did you
that left handed sonofabitch is the devil himself
if hes here then its time
we need to get juniper out here
we still need a motor
theres a motor in the scrap yard might work
i need one that runs
mud moves to the front of the boat trailer and begins dragging it fully onto the bank
i can get it runnin
tell him ellis
he built his own dirt bike
all right then
give it a shot
i dont know
that motors worth somethin
its not like this other junk
its been there for months
nobodys even gonna know its gone
he looks to mud
we do need a motor
ellis thinks on it as mud takes a deep breath and grabs the trailer again
the supermarket is busy
ellis stands at a pay phone out front as neckbone kicks a vending machine nearby
ellis looks at junipers motel
he scans the piggly wiggly parking lot and spots carvers black lincoln
ellis picks up the phone and deposits some change
i wanna talk to room
juniper watches tv o
s at the foot of the bed
the phone rings
she snaps up hits mute and grabs it
ive been goin crazy in this room

its time to take you out to him
well come get you

ellis hears her crying through the phone
hes got the boat
we helped him fix it up
its a good plan
just be ready
why are you even doing this
what do you mean
why are you helping us
cause yall love each other
juniper searches for a comment
ellis looking out over the parking lot sees may pearl getting out of a car with her mother and sister
ill see you tomorrow
juniper holds the phone worried
ellis turns and watches may pearl push a cart in the parking lot with her family
neckbone bangs at the coke machine
howd it go
carver sits behind the wheel of his lincoln
the man with the mustache james sits in the passenger seat next to him
carver notices ellis and neckbone standing in front of the piggly wiggly
he climbs out
gimme a quarter
this shit took mine
ellis watches may pearl entering the grocery store
he calls out with a wave
without stopping may pearl along with her sister and mother all turn
may pearl sees him but doesnt wave back
she continues inside
ellis looks confused then embarrassed
its all right man
shes with her family
i wanna get that motor before dark
they head to the dirt bike
ellis turns to see carver approaching
you remember me dont you
carver notes the healing bruise on ellis face
im sure sorry about that
yall caught me at a real bad time
ellis climbs on the bike
carver walks over to them
hold on now
i dont want yall thinkin im a bad guy
yall were just trying to do a job and i got in your way
carver removes a roll of twenties and peels off two
lets just say i bought that whole batch of fish yall were sellin

thatd bout do it
we dont want your money
carver steps in close to the boys
i bet yall really get around this town

carver removes a flier with muds picture and holds it out
you sure about that
take a look with your good eye
what about that girl in the motel
the pretty one
yall talk to her some more
he tucks the flier and the forty dollars into ellis hand
theres a number on there
yall let me know if you do
neckbone cranks the engine and backs the bike up with his feet
they pull away
moving ellis looks back to see carver watching them
neckbone pulls back a loose section of chain link fence surrounding the marine junkyard
ellis crouches through
ellis and neckbone creep through piles of starboard and boat parts
they stop at a party barge with only one pontoon
at its rear hangs a big rusted motor horsepower
neckbone quickly disassembles its attachment
the motor pops loose leaving the boys to strain against its heavy weight
they ease it to the ground
jesus thats heavy
the boys get on either side of the motor and begin half dragging it back to the fence line
a little girl dangles her feet off a loading platform and bites at an ice cream sandwich
she watches neckbone and ellis from a distance
ellis walks onto the houseboat as the sound of neckbones bike fades in the trees
he stops noticing a paper bag sitting on the waters edge of the boat
he goes over to it
he opens the sack and takes a quick inventory
a loaf of bread potted meats a bottle of jack daniels a roll of cash and an arkansas boat tag
ellis looks around no one
he looks over to toms boat
ellis scoops up the sack and heads inside
the digital wristwatch changes from to
neckbone sits on his bike parked near the vending machines at the piggly wiggly
ellis on the payphone scans the parking lot
no sign of carvers lincoln
no other bounty hunters
where are those bastards
i dont know
shes not answerin
what do you wanna do
take your bike around the side
ill check her room
well just have to hope no one sees us
neckbone cranks the bike and speeds toward the motel
ellis looks to the motel then the parking lot
ellis cautiously heads up the stairs
he eyes the parking lot at the piggly wiggly but still sees no sign of carvers men
he moves quickly toward junipers door
checking over his shoulder he knocks
he knocks again
he peeks through the window
neckbone gets off his bike and slips to the corner of the building
as he peeks his head out ellis nearly knocks him over on his way downstairs
they both flinch
was she there
ellis notices the front office come on
the motel clerk doesnt look up from his issue of lowrider as ellis and neckbone enter
scuse me sir
were lookin for the girl in room
you seen her
ive seen her
you see her today
yeah she came down askin for directions to the nearest bar
i told her to head out to a place on
ellis digests this
they turn to leave
wait a second are yall the little bastards tryin to sell fish to the guests
theyre already out the door
ellis and neckbone pull into the gravel lot in front of a roadside bar
the cinder block building sits by itself just off the highway
cars and motorcycles fill the lot
you think this is it
its gotta be
the small bar is loud and crowded
shoulder to shoulder patrons bump against one another as music blares
neckbone and ellis press through the crowd searching for juniper
they are a good foot shorter than anyone else
ellis notices a man at the bar
its miller the bounty hunter from kings motel
hes staring at something across the room
ellis follows his line of sight
the crowd weaves in front of him but then he sees her
juniper leans against a pool table at the far end of the bar
a guy whispers in her ear and kisses her neck
she throws her head back laughing
ellis watches in disbelief
nearby the bartender fills a customers shot glass
the two underage kids catch his attention
ellis face is frozen locked on juniper
neckbone places a hand on his shoulder
junipers eyes drift toward the boys
she makes eye contact with ellis and her smile vanishes
the guy keeps whispering in her ear
juniper straightens her back slightly
ellis cant take his eyes off her
juniper stares back at him but doesnt make a move
after a moment junipers eyes fall to the floor
she turns her head back to the guy
the crowd fills back in and the image is out of ellis reach
what the hell are yall doin
the bartender swoops in grabbing them both by the backs of their necks and shoving them toward the door
ellis strains against the thick hand
he tries to get another look at juniper but its too crowded
the bartender flings ellis and neckbone into the parking lot
neckbone slides on the loose gravel
yall stay outta here
ellis just stands staring at the front door
the bartender makes a swatting motion toward them
neckbone gathers his friend and leads him away
thanks a lot asshole
come on man
they head over to neckbones dirt bike
he pulls out the key and climbs on
ill take you home
were gonna have to tell mud
neckbone drops his head nods reluctantly
the boys struggle to pull the heavy motor out of their boat
it hits the shoreline with a thud
they lean over it sucking air
just leave it
mudll have to help get it
whatre you gonna tell him
ill just tell him the truth
mud stands at the back of the boat which now rests on the boat trailer near the water
his face is clean shaven and his hair is wetted back
his shirt still filthy is tucked into his pants
he whistles and works by the light of a small fire nearby
ellis steps out from behind a tree
hes holding the grocery sack that was left on his houseboat
mud hearing the voice quickly puts down his tools and turns to the woods
he smooths his clothes down
what you say there
ellis appears out of the dark followed by neckbone
muds eyes search the treeline for juniper
what you say ellis
ellis cant look him in the eye
we got that motor
is juniper okay
where is she
she didnt meet up with us
was it carver
it wasnt carver
mud straightens up prepares for the news
whats goin on ellis
she was supposed to meet us on the side of the motel
she never showed up
we went asking for her
the motel clerk told us she went to a bar out on
we tracked her down
she was there with another guy
they were together
muds face drops
he walks to the fire and shakes a cooking pot resting in the coals
the pot bubbles with roof tar
she probably thought carver was on to her
she knew the plan mud
she just didnt show up
what was she doin with the other guy
ellis hesitates not wanting to say
what were they doin ellis
they were playin pool
he was close up on her
they were laughin
he kissed her on the neck
and thats how it is
he takes the pot of roofing tar over to the boat and begins pasting some of the newly replaced boards with a flat stick
what do you want us to do
just go home ellis
ellis looks at neckbone then sets the grocery sack on the ground
tom left this for you
they slowly retreat into the woods and disappear
mud turns back to the campfire and shoves the pot into the ashes
his eyes soft and red reflect the flame
ellis and neckbone motor away from the island in the flat bottom boat
they look back at the shore
you think its all right to leave him alone
i doubt it
neckbone sees ellis concern
ill sleep over at your house tonight
we can check on him first thing tomorrow
as they head further up river the island grows smaller silhouetted by the moonlight
neckbone snores sprawled out on top of a sleeping bag on the floor
ellis sits up in bed with something on his mind
he gets up and steps gingerly over neckbone to exit the room
the house is silent
ellis slips into the kitchen and picks up the phone receiver mounted on the cabinet
he pulls the cord out to stand with his face in the corner
he dials waits and speaks softly into the receiver
is may pearl there
this is ellis
i called yesterday you give her my message
my name is ellis
im her boyfriend
oh shes asleep
i said shes asleep
the front door flies open
senior storms headlong toward ellis
ellis turns as senior yanks the phone by the cord
it snaps out of ellis hand and smashes apart on the floor
ellis flinches at the sight of his father flying at him
what the hell have you been doing
senior grabs ellis by the arms and shoves him against the den wall
mary lee comes running from her room
she slaps at her husbands arms and back
he swats her away
you tell her
you tell her what youve been up to
i dont know what youre sayin
take your hands off him senior
senior keeps ellis pinned to the wall with his left hand
he opens up and addresses mary lee with his right
crawford said a boat motor went missin from his stock yard
said his daughter saw this one and his friend haulin it off
this makes mary lee pause
now you tell me right now did you steal that motor
we didnt steal it
lie to me again
we thought it was junk
we didnt think it was worth anything
a cool anger rushes over seniors face
he releases ellis and takes a step back
you tell me i raised a thief
im not a thief
you take property thats not yours
property that belongs to another man
that junk is his livelihood
im ashamed of you
ellis drops his head
his face flushed
to mary lee shut your mouth
you think you can take things and not have him see it
neither one of you has any respect for a mans livelihood
a life that puts clothes on your back and food in your stomach
dont you blame this on me
one doesnt have a thing to do with the other and you know it
dont tell me what i know
if you can steal a mans life out from under him in front of your son and think he wont take a lesson from it than youre even dumber than
stop it dad
senior volleys a finger at ellis
shes raisin you a snake like herself and you can curl up with her fore i give a damn
you just remember this when you watch them rip this house apart board by board
you hear me
mary lee slaps senior hard
he turns to her saying nothing
youre a man whos never had the strength to support his own life
i never asked you for a thing and ive never took a thing from you that i couldnt provide for on my own
if they do tear my home apart the only joy ill have in my heart is knowin that theyll be tearing you out of my life for good
she wipes her eyes and turns her attention to ellis
youll return that motor from where you found it and youll apologize in person to the man you took it from
i wont hear about anything like this again
mary lee walks to the front door
she collects her purse and keys and exits quietly
senior and ellis stand in silence which feels even more uncomfortable than the shouting
ellis finally speaks
i cant take that motor back
but ill pay him for it
ill pay him what he wants for it
senior stoic pivots his body away from the boy
i dont care what you do ellis
senior retreats to the bedroom
ellis is left alone in the wake
he looks to his room
the door opens slightly and neckbone takes a step out
neckbone doesnt say anything
he just bites at his lip sympathy for his friend
charred hunks of driftwood smolder in a ruined pile on the sand
they constitute the remains of a large bonfire
neckbone and ellis stare at the ash
what the hells all this
its a bonfire
i guess he didnt care about bein seen
ellis kicks at one of the burned logs
he bends down and finds the bottle of jack daniels smashed
he had something else on his mind
ellis leads neckbone into the treeline
muds yellow shirt hangs partially ripped from a tree branch
ellis pulls it off the limb
concerned they head deeper into the woods over the fallen tree trunk that bridges the creek
the boys watch mud through the trees at a distance
hes crouched on the deck of the boat fiddling with wiring
mud giving no sign he sees the boys yells out to them
what are yall hidin for
mud drops the wiring and scales down to the bank
they emerge from the woods
ellis carries the yellow shirt
we found your shirt
ellis tosses it to him
mud tosses it back
i dont need it anymore
mud goes to the motor at the rear to tinker with more wires
we saw whats left of your bonfire
somebody couldve seen you
you do some drinkin last night
i did a lot of drinkin last night
mud stops and walks over to address the boys
his face is pale and his manner is curt
neck im gonna need you here to get the motor runnin
ellis i need you to do something else for me
mud removes a folded note from his back pocket
i need you to take this to juniper
ellis takes the letter
mud goes back to the boat motor
he motions to neckbone to join him
you still takin juniper
i had a dream last night
i saw juniper laying in a field with another man
they were making love
i walked out into the field
walked toward em
i was so angry the tips of my ears were burnin
thats how i knew i was gonna kill this man
but when i got up close enough i saw that the man she was with had tattoos on his back just like mine
i moved in closer and the guy turns his head back toward me
hair for hair dead truth the guy she was with was me
mud ducks back under the motor
ellis looks at neckbone worried
ill finish the boat but id be surprised if i live long enough to sail on it
a vision of yourself is a sure sign of death
neck can you grab me a socket wrench
neckbone and ellis walk to the toolbox sitting nearby
they crouch by it speaking quietly
you be all right
what about you
hell be okay
can i borrow your bike
neckbone fishes the key out of his pocket
dont tump it
neckbone walks over to mud with the toolbox
letter in hand ellis gives a final look toward muds labor and walks back into the woods
on his way he stops to hang muds shirt on a tree branch
ellis rides in the flat bottom boat alone
he stares at the letter in his hand
ellis sits on the dirt bike
he scans the parking lot
no black lincoln
his eyes stop on a green pick up
miller sits inside
ellis looks around and finds a pay phone nearby
he gets off the bike and walks toward it
ellis removes the flier carver gave him
he dials a phone number copied at the bottom
into the phone hello
i saw the guy youre lookin for
yeah hes crazy lookin
saw him at the wal mart outside of gillet
he was buyin some beanie weenie
bout five minutes ago
ellis hangs up the phone
he walks back over to the bike climbs on and waits
after a moment he watches as millers green pick up pulls out of the piggly wiggly parking lot and races away
ellis cranks the bike
ellis at a slight crouch keeps his eyes on the piggly wiggly parking lot
the green pick up is nowhere in sight
at junipers door he knocks twice softly
the door swings opens
juniper stands there holding a lit cigarette
i was wonderin when id see you
ellis checks over his shoulder and walks inside the bed is unmade and the room is a bit of a mess
ellis keeps his head down
juniper closes the door and takes a seat on the edge of the bed
she grabs the remote control and mutes the television
im sorry about last night
i didnt plan on
before she can finish ellis has fished the letter out of his pocket and holds it out to her
im supposed to give this to you
juniper takes the letter
ellis goes to the door
he pulls the bedroom curtain back slightly to check the parking lot
the coast is clear
did you read it
i gotta go
he turns to her
all you had to do was be there
then whyd you even come here
i came here to leave with him
i really did
now i guess i just came to say goodbye
his eyes fall to the floor
you dont know us ellis
weve been headin this way for a long time
i know hed do anything for you
she puts her cigarette out in a coke can on the floor
you really believe that
juniper speaks to him gently almost smiling
its a look of resignation
muds a born liar
thats what makes him so likable
he makes people feel good about themselves
hes a romantic
i dont think he means to hurt people
but when people get close to him thats what happens
ellis watches her as she goes to the sink and wets the end of a towel
she dabs her eyes at the mirror
i do love him ellis
but i cant spend the rest of my life runnin with him
i may not know what kind of life i want but i know thats not it
her back to him ellis watches as she unfolds the letter and begins reading
he angles himself to see her face in the mirror
he watches her eyes scanning the words
she finishes folds the letter back up then turns to him
tell him i understand
whats it say
it says its over
tell him ive packed my things
tell him ive gone
she takes a deep breath and smiles at him
ellis turns and walks out
ellis dejected no longer bothers to look over his shoulder
he walks to the staircase but stops there
feeling the need to say something more he goes back to her room
he puts his knuckle flat on the door but hesitates
he leans over and looks through the window
the sliver in the curtain gives him a glimpse
juniper is curled up on the end of the bed
she is sobbing
ellis watches longer than he should before pulling his head away from the window
ellis heads back downstairs
ellis riding the dirtbike looks to his left into the sonic drive in parking lot
the high school kids have gathered there again
he notices a rust colored ford coup
the driver an older kid named kyle sits beside may pearl laughing
ellis steers into traffic and crosses the street
he pulls onto a patch of grass at the edge of the sonic parking lot
in one motion ellis tumps the bike on its side and makes a b line for the coup
kyles hand is on may pearls knee
so whatd she say
she said she didnt like him that much
i told her i thought he was all right
ellis appears with his elbows in the drivers side window
he sticks his head so far in the door that kyle has to lean back in his seat to make room
may pearl is surprised
kyle snorts out a laugh
you get my phone calls
ive been callin you
motions with his head whos this guy
get your head outta my car kid
ellis takes his right elbow and quickly knocks kyle in the mouth
it splits his upper lip
kyle grabs his face
i called you twice yesterday
your sister didnt tell you
kyle slings the door open knocking ellis to the pavement
from the ground ellis can see that kyle is big and considerably tougher than the skinny kid he punched before
kyles friends from other cars take notice and begin to converge on them
ellis makes a move for kyles legs but is kicked back to the pavement
kyle straddles him on the ground and punches him
another punch to ellis face
may pearl is out of the car and yelling
stop it kyle
may pearl pulls kyle by the collar
by his own will he raises off of ellis keeping an eye on him
a streak of blood stretches from ellis nose to his ear
he gets to his feet dazed
ellis wipes at his nose and sees may pearl shove kyle
kyle smiles and turns to his friends who laugh
the crowd that has collected consists of older high school guys and girls
ellis steps toward may pearl and is met with a shove too
what the hell are you doin here ellis
you cant just run up and punch people im with
im sorry i just wanted to know why you hadnt called me back
why would i call you back ellis
because youre my girlfriend
the crowd is watching
im not your girlfriend
we went on one date
that doesnt matter
but what ellis
what did you expect
i love you
we can make this work
we can figure it out
i love you
ellis is losing it
his eyes are red
he looks at the crowd of kids
there are smiles and some snickering
may pearl is speechless
she just stares at him
ellis turns and walks back to the dirt bike
may pearls girlfriends gather around her
she shakes her head dumbstruck
ellis lifts the bike off the ground
he looks back at may pearl who appears to be shrugging off the whole affair in front of her friends
ellis speeds off
a fire snaps and pops on the riverbank next to ellis houseboat
ellis drags a piece of particle board from a trash pile nearby
he drops the board onto the fire and stands back to watch the blaze
neckbones bike leans on a tree behind him
seniors truck rattles to a stop in the gravel just down the bank
he jumps out of the cab exasperated by the fire his son has started by their home
what the hell are you doin
ellis says nothing
he doesnt move
senior continuing to yell runs and drags a hose up from the houseboat
what the hells wrong with you
the fire hisses as senior turns the hose on it
look at me
ellis finally looks up at his father
a phone rings from inside the houseboat
senior holds the hose in front of him
put this damn thing out
ellis takes the hose as senior stomps on board to catch the phone
ellis drops the hose
seniors voice speaking into the telephone faintly carries outside
ellis turns his head to listen
i dont give a shit
i dont care what you do
im done with it
ellis moves around the fire so he can see the houseboat through the flames
he hears the phone slam down
senior appears at the back door
he stares at ellis through the fire
ellis moves to the side but realizes senior isnt staring at him
hes staring at the fire
senior disappears back into the house
there is a commotion
ellis watches as senior bursts out of the house holding an armful of womans clothes
senior walks up to the bonfire and begins tossing clothes on top piece by piece
what are you doing
ellis watches as dresses and blouses begin to shrivel up in the flames
thats moms stuff
stop ellis shoves at senior
he easily counters the boy with his arm and continues tossing the clothes into the fire
ellis is screaming and crying
ellis tries yanking the remaining clothes out of his fathers hands but senior shakes him off
he watches with tears as senior tosses all of the clothes on
senior watches his wifes clothes burn
ellis backs away to the bike
he climbs on cranks the engine and speeds off
ellis grounds the flat bottom on shore and jumps out
ellis thrashes through the woods
his muddy feet stomp across the fallen tree trunk that bridges the creek
the boat rests on its trailer on the edge of the bank
mud stands on board looking down at the motor
neckbone tools in hand has his head buried in the motor
try it now
mud turns a switch
ellis emerges from the treeline
mud sees him and hops down from the boat
he walks up to him
ellis punches mud with as much force as he can muster
its barely enough to turn muds face but it stuns him
youre a liar
makin two kids run around doin work youre too scared to do yourself
makin me tell her its over cause youre too scared to do it yourself
mud steps back and gives the boy his space
neckbone has made his way over and watches from behind mud
you said you loved her and you lied
you gave up on her and she gave up on you just like everybody else
i trusted you
bonfires and crosses
wolfs eye bullshit
mud tries to approach him but the boy explodes shoving him
you never cared about her
you never cared about us
not like you said
not enough to matter
you used us
come on ellis
mud holds a hand out to him
ellis slaps it away
you made me a thief
ellis walks back into the woods
mud exhales and turns back to neckbone
let me talk to him
ellis walks through the woods
ellis stop for a second
neckbone watches as ellis reaches the tree trunk that bridges the creek
ellis steps onto the log but his muddy shoes miss a step
neckbone sees ellis disappear down into the creek bed
neckbone rushes over
he cranes his neck out to peer over the edge a solid eight foot drop into the creek
ellis floats face up in the shallow water
a wound on his head from a nearby rock
the nest of water moccasins has been disturbed snakes writhe neckbones eyes widen
he darts back toward the shore
mud stands at the rear of the boat massaging his jaw
mud hears the yelling
neckbone explodes from the trees
mud rushes forward
mud looks around
his shirt hangs from a tree limb nearby
he snags it and darts into the woods
mud streaks through the woods as he gets his other arm through the shirt sleeve
he reaches the creek
without hesitating mud leaps down into the water scoops ellis into his arms and scales up the opposite side of the creek bed
mud sprints for the north side of the island
neckbone chases after them
mud cradles ellis in his arms as he rushes to the flat bottom boat
he sets ellis gently inside
neckbone on his heels
mud shoves the boat into the water and hops in
neckbone wades out and crawls up the side of the boat
get the motor started
neckbone cranks the motor
as they move up river mud searches ellis body
he looks at his neck his arms he pulls up his shirt
is he okay
is he bit
mud notices ellis jeans leg riding up
he pulls the jeans back
a bite in the middle of his calf
its a bluish bruise with two distinct red dots
the skin around the bite has already begun to swell
he rips the jeans up to the thigh
mud tears a section of cloth from the bottom of his own shirt and creates a tourniquet just below ellis knee
what time is it
mud pulls a black sharpie out of his pocket
neckbone doesnt answer just stares
neckbone checks his watch
its four eighteen
mud draws a line on ellis leg just above the swollen bite
yell out every minutes
mud elevates ellis leg then gently cups his head
he dabs the gash on ellis forehead
is he gonna be okay
we just need to get him to a clinic
is there still one in town
its the closest
im gonna need your bike
are you bit
mud shakes his head
he holds ellis as they move steadily up river
the flat bottom boat approaches the riverbank
neckbone points to the sandy ridge and yells up to mud
my bike should be just over that ridge
mud looks at ellis leg
the swelling has crept up his thigh
black lines with numbers mark its progress
ellis face has taken on a blue tint
the boat hasnt reached the shore but mud takes ellis in his arms and jumps into the water
he wades onto the bank
mud straddles it turning ellis body so they are face to face
he cranks the bike and speeds away
neckbone makes it to the top of the ridge in time to see mud disappear into the trees
mud speeds the dirt bike down the two lane highway
hes far too big for the bike and its even trickier balancing ellis
coming up on a slow moving pick up overloaded with junk mud veers into the opposing lane
mud darts back to his lane in time to miss a semi
a male nurse wheels an elderly man through the sliding double front doors of a small clinic
mud appears around the corner
the bike speeding toward the entrance
in a fluid motion mud takes ellis in his arms and lifts his leg over the bike
the bike tilts and slides across the pavement smacking solidly into the curb
mud has managed to stay on his feet with the boy in his arms and rushes through the automatic front doors
the reception area has a dozen patients sitting in it
a check in desk to the left
mud holds ellis out in his arms
a female nurse rushes out of the check in area
just stay calm
whats going on
hes been snake bit
another nurse rushes off calling for a doctor
the room becomes more frenzied
hes snake bit
a cotton mouth
on his calf
just under an hour
as quickly as mud gets this out a group of nurses rush out of a door at the end of the room pushing a gurney
they take ellis from muds arm place him on the gurney and speed him into the back of the clinic
the commotion gone the reception area feels oddly still
mud takes a deep breath
he looks to his right
patients stare at him
hes beyond disheveled
hes crazy looking
mud turns to his left
the male nurse stares at him
for the first time mud realizes hes out in the open
mud slowly backs up
were gonna need some information
mud backs out of the automatic doors
the entire room stares at him
mud is outside
the glass doors close
he nervously checks over his shoulders
he spots a bank of trees just down from the clinic
he heads for them
the front doors slide open and the male nurse walks out
mud hops into the bank of trees and disappears
the patients in the reception area settle back into their seats and discuss the commotion
the male nurse enters and walks behind the check in window
the male nurse fingers through a pile of papers
he removes one of the fliers that carver and his men have been showing
the nurse studies the photo looking back at the front doors
he picks up the phone and dials the number at the bottom
in the adjoining room the phone rings
king steps through the doorway takes a seat on the bed and answers
yessir we are
king takes a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbles on a pad on the nightstand
now whered you say you were
but you say he left the boy
and your name sir
the sun has been down for awhile
juniper leans on the railing outside her room taking long drags from a cigarette
she sees millers green pick up parked below
suddenly the headlights pop on and the truck pulls away
she watches curious as it speeds out of sight
a train whistle blows in the distance but is overtaken by a semi rumbling down the street
she watches the semi pass revealing the day nite gas stations parking lot
a mud stands in the corner of the lot
half lit by a sodium a lamp he stares up at her
juniper raises up
even in the dim light she knows its him
she doesnt move
mud holds up a hand waves
juniper slowly waves back
she tries to smile at him but shes about to cry and its hard to muster
after a long moment he turns his back and disappears in the shadows at the side of the gas station
juniper watches after him
the night sky is dark purple
an unnatural color
ellis is on his back
his head jostles at the sound of thumping
it sounds like the hood of a car denting in
his eyes open
he stares up at an absurdly full moon
its so bright it totally silhouettes the tree branches overhead
the thumping continues
ellis puts his hands on the edge of the flat bottom boat hes floating in and pulls himself up
he leans over the side to see whats causing the noise
the water is jet black
the entire bayou pulsates
ellis eyes grow wide as the thumping reveals itself
the moonlight illuminates their shiny black backs as they twist and churn in what seems like one giant ball of snakes
ellis lies back in the boat bringing his arms close to his chest
he flinches at each thump
his eyes squeeze shut
his eyes open
ellis bolts up in bed covered in a cold sweat
mary lee places a palm on his chest
just set back
mary lee guides ellis back down on the pillow
senior stands with his arm on her shoulder
they look down at their son
where am i
we got you home
ellis takes a second to get his bearings
his mother lifts a glass of sprite up to his mouth
he takes a sip
you had us scared son
senior steps forward and kisses ellis on the forehead
staying close to his face
im so glad youre okay
the doctors gave you some medicine
you had a snake bite
howd i get to the doctor
a man brought you in
no one knew him
ellis tries to sit up in bed but his mother stops him
you just need to rest up now
we can talk all about it later
do you need anything
are you hungry
senior gently pats her shoulders
lets let him rest
mary lee touches seniors hand on her shoulder
ill be back in to check on you but just try and sleep if you can
senior leads mary lee to the door
they turn back
i love yall
we love you too ellis
they exit the room
ellis rests his head back on the pillow and takes a deep breath
mud and neckbone shove against the back of the boat trailer
the wheels of the trailer rock at the edge of the banks incline
sheets of metal roofing taken from the shack ellis and neckbone dismantled line a runway into the water
the wheels finally turn over
the trailer rolls down the bank and splashes into the water
the boat shimmies
mud and neckbone follow the trailer into knee deep water and shove on the boat
a final push jettisons it into the river
they step back as the boat drifts out
a rope tied to its back becomes taught as it stretches from a tree on shore
the sun does shine on a dogs ass some days
it aint sunk yet
he holds out his hand which neckbone slaps
i wish ellis could see it
mud walks back on shore and collects his duffel bag
i owe you your end of the deal
mud removes the pistol from the back of his jeans
neckbones eyes light up
mud hands it over and neckbone immediately notices a hole where the clip is missing
where the bullets
the deal was for the gun not the bullets
neckbone begrudgingly crams the pistol into the back of his pants
i got one last favor to ask you
neckbone sucks his teeth
water gently laps at the side of ellis houseboat
the bayou is quiet
from the darkness neckbone and mud appear in the flat bottom boat
they paddle with their hands
approaching in silence
ellis stares at the ceiling unable to sleep
a tap comes from the window
ellis sits up in bed
mud pokes his head in
mud pulls his body through the window
its tight but he manages to make it look somewhat graceful
mud takes a quick survey of the dark room
ellis begins to get out of bed
no dont get up
mud motions him back down and pulls the chair from the desk over to the bed
they speak in hushed voices
howd you get here
neck brought me
neckbone sits in the flat bottom tied off at the corner
all eight of the bounty hunters sit hunkered in the trees
carver squats next to a stump
he loads shotgun shells into a gauge pump and motions for the others to fan out along the bank
we got the boat in the water
smooth sailin from here on out
wish you coulda seen it
didnt feel right leavin town without sayin goodbye
there is an awkward moment
im sorry bout what i said

my dad says you cant count on women lovin you
he says you cant trust it

youll make plenty mistakes of your own no need takin on everybody elses
youre a good man ellis
if you find a girl half as good youll be all right
youre a good man too mud
but maybe from here on out i can be
a shotgun blast rips a fist sized hole in the flimsy interior wall
mud as if by reflex yanks ellis from the sheets and shoves him under the bed
bits of sheetrock fall like snow flakes as more holes blast through the bedroom wall
mud flinches with each shot
he covers his own head with one hand and the boy with the other
just stay under there
the sound of shotgun shells being slipped into the chamber
mud gets to a crouch
through the holes in the wall mud makes out nelson the fat bounty hunter reloading his gun
nelson finishes reloading
the riddled bedroom wall hangs in front of him
a door opens behind him
he swivels around
senior in a robe rushes from his bedroom with a pistol leveled
hes met with a shotgun blast just above his head
pellets nick his face
senior hits the ground and elbows his way back inside his bedroom door
senior screams his voice cracking
muffled through the wall dont move ellis
just stay put
they just want me
through the holes mud sees nelson approaching ellis bedroom
he runs for the window at the foot of the bed
another shotgun blast throws open the door as mud leaps out
mud crashes headfirst onto the edge of the houseboat grasping for anything to keep from sliding off
his hand catches a metal deck cleat
it bends under his weight but holds
mud gets to his feet and is met by the tip of a rifle
miller the man from the cafe stands poised to fire
muds hand slips to the back of his pants for his pistol
he looks to the flat bottom tied at the far edge of the boat
no sign of neckbone
millers finger curls around the trigger
suddenly a bullet snicks through millers neck
millers hand comes up to his neck but cant hold the blood running from it
he topples into the water
tom blankenship sits in the folding chair on the roof of his houseboat
he shucks an empty shell from a high powered rifle complete with scope
the long suitcase from the photo in toms house sits open at his feet
it has compartments for the disassembled rifle
tom quickly raises to a new firing position
he squints an eye searching for another target
a from this vantage point ellis houseboat is clearly visible partially lit by the two flood lights
four other bounty hunters swarm the boat
still under the bed ellis tries to hold his breath as nelsons boots step into the room
they pause for a moment before sluggishly struggling through the bedroom window
mud rushes to untie the flat bottom
a bullet splinters the corner of the dock sending shards of wood into muds hand
he sees two more gunmen skirting toward him on the deck of the houseboat
mud takes cover against the wall and finds the muzzle of nelsons gun teetering out ellis window
he grabs the muzzle and yanks the shotgun free
nelson stuck in the window looks up in time to take a rifle butt in the face
he falls back into the room unconscious
james the man with the mustache holds neckbone in a headlock trying to cover his mouth
carver stands with his shotgun leveled and fires at mud
mud ducks as carvers shot takes out a chunk of siding
the sound of boots rush up the side of the boat
mud gun in hand jumps back through ellis window
carver turns to neckbone
let him go
james unhands the boy
neckbone sprints into the woods
they move toward the houseboat
mud gets to his feet stepping over an unconscious nelson on his way to the bedroom door
you still down there bud
mud pops out of the bedroom into the den
mary lee curled under the bed frantically dials the phone
senior propped against the closed door uses his undershirt to dab the pellet wounds around his neck
hearing footsteps he cracks the door open
he sees mud standing in the den
senior cocks his pistol the front door is kicked open
mud dives behind a lazy boy as a bounty hunter fires through the doorway
the back of the lazy boy explodes in fluff and fabric
mud raises up to return fire forcing the man back out the door
mud crouches back behind the lazy boy
unbeknownst to him another man appears outside two sliding glass doors
the man raises his rifle at mud
one of toms bullets rips through the mans chest and shatters the glass door
another hunter steps into the now broken door frame
mud fires the shotgun blowing the man into the patio grill
a mud can see toms houseboat silhouetted across the a bayou
a muzzle flash sparks from the top of toms boat
this makes mud smile
the front door kicks open again and more pellets shatter through the den
mud raises to return fire
one shot two the third is a dead click
he drops back behind the chair out of shells
carver steps across the plank onto the houseboat followed by james
carver motions him around back toward ellis window
flush him out this way
carver walks to the covered carport
the hunters at the front door continue taking pot shots at the furniture
mud flinches at each new round fired
ellis cautiously slides out from under his bed and crouches next to the bedroom door
he peeks through a crack
he sees mud pinned behind the lazy boy
they make eye contact
muds eyes move to something behind ellis
ellis turns to see james passing by his bedroom window
tom scans ellis boat through the scope on his rifle
he sees carver creeping around the carport
he pans right to find james taking a position near the patio doors
tom pauses seeing ellis appear at the corner of the boat just behind james
the firing from the front door has stopped
mud takes a deep breath sets the empty shotgun on the ground then rushes out the sliding glass doors as the men out front reload
mud makes it outside his back to james leveled rifle
james and mud both turn at the sound of ellis voice
one of toms bullets drops james dead
carver appears at the carport end of the boat
he raises his shotgun toward mud
he snaps the bolt open and closed but it jams
he jerks at the lever looking up he sees carver taking aim
mud takes a running leap off the side of the boat
mud is struck in the back by the shotgun blast
the force of the shot spins him in the air
he crashes into the water
carver approaches the edge of the boat
he stares down into the swirling dark water
no sign of mud
tom slaps open the bolt and yanks the spent cartridge out with his fingers
he pumps the shotgun and fires into the murky water
the pellets pepper the surface
still no sign of mud
carver pumps the shotgun a final time but before he can get another shot off toms bullet rips open carvers chest sending him sprawling through the broken patio doors
he exhales shucks the bolt once more
his eyes scan the dark water
ellis runs to the edge of the boat
senior exits the houseboat pistol pointed
he sees ellis and runs to him
senior grabs the boy keeping his pistol up
ellis drops to his knees and senior crouches with him holding him tight in his arms
the two sit alone on the edge of the houseboat
the river seems especially quiet now
the sky shows faint signs of morning a few streaks of light
the blue red and white lights from police cruisers and ambulances bounce up into the trees
a frenzy of police activity swarms from the aftermath left on ellis houseboat
men in wetsuits prepare a dive
blanket covered bodies are wheeled off on gurneys
two of the bounty hunters unharmed sit locked in the back of a state trooper vehicle
ellis senior and mary lee sit huddled together under the carport
they watch the emergency workers stream past
senior wraps his arms around them
ellis looks across the bayou to toms boat
police flashlights bob and weave throughout
no sign of tom
a local officer strings caution tape across the broken patio doors
two state troopers hover over carvers body
the troopers step away and the local officer cranes toward the body
he studies carvers face
stepping aside the officer takes a cell phone from his pocket and dials
he turns his back away from the troopers
the phone rings in the pines motel
king enters from the adjoining room and takes a seat on the bed
youre speaking to him
his face taut
a long pause okay
king hangs up the phone
he sits at the edge of the bed overwhelmed by the news
its dark on the river
moonlight barely shows the ripples in the slow moving current
music from a country station slips out across the surface of the water
galens jambox sits next to a small lantern in his flat bottom boat
his helper snores fully reclined with an empty can of budweiser resting on his gut
his feet are propped next to a tiny bell rigged to a line that disappears into the water
the bell rings
the river bed swirls inside two distinct spots of light
galen using his new diving lights scoops a final mussel shell into the net before tying it off
he tugs at the line
its pitch black save for the shafts of light projected from galens shoulders
he tilts the lights toward the surface
the line leading up to the bottom of the boat dances in and out of the high beams
only his backside is visible
a cloud of blood trails from the holes there
a worker cinches a thick strap across the deck of ellis houseboat
ellis watches as workers affix straps from his houseboat to a crane resting in the bed of a large truck on the bank
the sound of neckbones dirt bike rattles through the trees
he appears behind ellis and parks
you got your bike back
mud dinged the shit out of it
neckbone takes a seat next to ellis
they watch the workers
theyre really doin it
its the law
they ever find tom
the boys focus on tom blankenships boat across the bayou
it sits vacant covered in police tape
your dad not here
said he couldnt watch it
hes pickin me up in a minute
got deliveries today
they sit in silence as the workers exit off the houseboat
heard on the news
they still hadnt found muds body
you think hes dead
i dont know
i hope not
the crane begins lifting up the houseboat
the metal wires tighten and the entire structure creaks
a sucking sound as the flotilla separate from the water
the boat hangs suspended in the air
a horn honks behind the boys
ellis turns to see seniors truck
i gotta go
come by the apartment
help me set my room up
neckbone watches ellis climb into the bed of the pick up and take his spot on the coolers
the sound of twisting metal shifts his attention back to the houseboat being swung over a flatbed semi
senior glances at the houseboat being set on the flatbed
he puts the truck in reverse and pulls away
not looking back
ellis rides in the back of the truck on top of the coolers
he watches the town pass by
a the marina junkyard
ellis and his father unload a cooler at the back of a tented flea market
a woman comes out to greet them
seniors truck pulls into the parking lot of a newly finished apartment complex
the two story buildings are modest
the truck idles out front
ellis grabs the door handle
he turns to senior
ill see you next week
ellis begins to get out but stops when senior speaks
you mind your mother okay
this is a big change for her
she needs your support
i love you
love you too
ellis climbs out
he watches as senior pulls away
he stands alone in front of the apartments studying the surroundings
a busy road out front
a gas station and collection of stores
a lot of people and commotion
a compact car pulls into a parking spot one building down
ellis watches as three college age girls climb out dressed in running shorts and t shirts
two are heavy set the other is petite
they joke and laugh
one sees ellis and waves
ellis nods to her
he tracks them as they walk inside
the river rushes past
a large motor churns the water
tom stands steering muds salvaged boat down river
he cranes his neck seeing something up ahead
tom kills the motor
looking out over the bow hes pleased by what he sees
his eyes glint almost a smile
he walks to the small cabin and enters
mud rests flat on his stomach on the cushioned bench
shirtless gauze bandages wrap around his chest and back
tom walks in and kneels next to him
touches his shoulder
muds eyes open
come on son
you need to see this
mud groggy raises up
tom helps him to his feet putting an arm over his shoulders
tom practically carries mud outside
tom and mud slowly maneuver out the door and take a place near the front of the boat
mud pulls his head up
looks out ahead
the sight in front of him grabs his attention
he perks up
a tributary from the mississippi river opens up into a vast stretch of ocean
mud smiles showing the missing tooth
tom and mud stand on deck as their boat drifts slowly into the open waters of the gulf of mexico
