platoon the sound now of a c air cargo plane roaring over us and we cut sharply to as the c coasts to a stop the hatch rotating down on
a hot dusty lifeless airstrip somewhere in vietnam
nothing seems to live or move in the midday sun
a dozen new recruits step off the plane unloading their duffel bags looking around like only the new can look around their hair regulation clipped crisp new green fatigues fitting
them like cardboard
chris taylor is just another one of them as he turns into a tight closeup to look at a motorized cart pulling up alongside hes about
his face unburned yet by the sun is tense bewildered innocent eyes searching for the truth
they fall now on a heap of body bags in the back of the cart
two soldiers begin loading them onto the plane
flies hundreds of flies buzz around them the only cue to their contents
next to chris southern accent that what i think it is
a look i guess so
an uncomfortable look between them
okay lets go
as they move out chris eyes moving with the body bags being loaded onto the plane
moving over now to a motley half dozen veterans bypassing them on their way to the plane
they look happy
very happy chatting it up
they pass the newboys and they shake their heads their eyes full of an almost mocking pity
well ill be dipped in shit new meat
sorry bout that boys sin loi buddy
you gonna love the nam man for fucking ever
chris looking at them
they pass except for the last man who walks slower than the rest a slight limp
his eyes fall on chris
theyre frightening eyes starved hollow sunken deep in his face black and dangerous
the clammy pallor of malaria clings to him as he looks at chris through decayed black teeth
then the sun flares out on him and hes past
and chris looks back
its as if the man was not real
for a moment there
as if he were a ghost
chris walking duffel bag on the shoulder looks up at the lollipop sun burning a hole through the sky
a rushing sound now
of frightening intensity an effect combining the blast of an airplane with the roar of a lion as we hardcut to the sun matches the intensity of the previous shot
as we move down into thick green jungle
we hear the sound of men coming a lot of men
the thwack of a machete
brush being bulled
they are getting close
the credits continue to run
subtitle reads december bravo company th infantry division somewhere near the cambodian border
a sweating white face comes into view
chris cutting point
machete in one hand whacking out a path for the platoon m in the other he looks like hes on the verge of heat exhaustion
breathing too hard pacing himself all wrong bumping into things tripping not quite falling he looks pathetic here in the naturalness of the jungle
an urban transplant slightly neurotic and getting more so
his rucksack is coming apart as well about badly packed pounds banging noisily
behind him barnes now comes the platoon sergeant
then the rto his radio man humming lightly
others are behind the column snaking back deep into the brush
we cut around some faces of the platoon all to be seen later
young faces hard and dirty after weeks in the field exhausted yet alert fatigues filthy slept in torn personalized hair way past regulation length medals bandanas
a jungle army
chris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters
transfers the machete to his other slightly less blistered hand
the kid cuts on struggling but trying on his last reserves of strength smashing almost straight forward through brush not even bothering to look ahead
he smells something looks around slows his pace eyes working
around to the base of a tree
he moves past it
and as he does so the camera from his pov comes around on a dead decomposing day old gook eyes starting from its sockets worms and flies feasting
chris draws his breath in terrified
barnes suddenly appears alongside his hard humourless eyes looking annoyed from the gook to chris
what are you waiting for
he aint gonna bite you
chris looks at him with pent up hatred and crashes on
at the company pc captain harris on the radio
bravo two six
whats the delay up there move it out on point
weve got a link up at phase line whiskey at one eight zero zero over
at the platoon pc lieutenant wolfe sweats heavily as he speaks in his radio
he is also new to the field a dark little feisty guy about very hairy especially in the eyebrows an intense get ahead look
two bravo two move it out
six says were jamming em up back there
barnes upfront turns to sal his radio man under his breath
tell that dipshit to get fucked
get that other freshmeat up here
as barnes picks up his pace irritated now at this reprimand from the co coming up on chris who is soaked now from head to foot in sweat dizzy feeling
sick about to vomit
what the hells the matter with you taylor
you a sorry ass motherfucker
he grabs chriss machete out of his hand and bulls his way into the foliage tearing it apart setting a new pace
chris being bypassed by the column their eyes on him
he is swatting at the red ants that are all over his neck
gardner another new recruit fat hustling up to replace him
a big and black medic doc comes over gentle eyes and manner with him is sergeant elias concerned
i got ants on my neck
shaking them out helping him yeah black ants are killers you look sick man
you need a little salt
reaching into his satchel sergeant elias a handsome graceful dark haired indian kid of the squad sergeant is taking items out of chris pack air mattress extra unnecessary clothing extra
canteens grenades gas mask books
shaking his head amused youre humping way too much troop dont need half this shit
ill haul it for you but next time you check it out with me okay
chris nodding grateful panting
the men passing watching
chris sorry about this trying to keep up face
bunny a young year old with an angels face is pissing in the dead gooks face
king passes glances at him
youre a sick mother bunny
bunny laughing about it
chris standing there one moment fighting for his breath suddenly passes out going over with his pound rucksack hitting the ground with a loud bang
concerned hold it up
on chris his eyes opening
he seems all right
trying to get up im okay
chris crumples backwards
elias helps him
the company about men who seem insignificant amid the size of the surrounding jungle is digging into a perimeter of some yard radius
a resupply chopper lifts off in a flurry of blowing leaves
bare chested soldiers chop down trees clear fields of fire set out claymores fill sandbags chow down
little fires snake up against the greying red horizon
we cut close on a pair of grungy feet the staple of the infantry moving up to doc the medic bandaging them for fu sheng a hawaiin kid
rhah sets his tripflare
crawford with him putting out a claymore
back in the perimeter rodriguez sets his m in the newly dug foxhole
sal next to him is shaving in his helmet
king looks like a king
a lion of a black man but with a sleepy gentle face not to be roused is painfully trying to scrawl a letter home with the pencil held awkwardly mouthing
francis a young baby faced black with long lashes and soft eyes peeks over his shoulder shaking his head
shit king it aint d e r e man its d e a r and sara dont have no two rs in it fool
shame on you
king shrugs a sleepy stoned voice
dont matter she knows what it means
an she dont read too good nohow
elias washes himself attentive to his body slender and well muscled and extremely handsome youth
of indian blood with long black hair generous smile wide facial bone structure gypsy eyes and the cleanest white teeth he could be a young greek god
he is given somewhat to panache a silver wristband on his arm a bandana of black parachute silk hanging from his neck his fatigues tightened down at the ankle he
pulls his pants down checking for crotch rot applying talcum powder to the area his buttocks facing us
lerner a white kid from florida stopping to admire the frontal view
mumm any time sweetheart
lerner youd choke to death on it
at the company command post a beehive of activity with its four radios personnel some vietnamese scouts milling around
captain harris is running down a field map with his three lieutenants
harris a broad shouldered fine looking military specimen with the requisite southern accent and football coach mannerism is directing his remark to nd platoons lt
wolfe who looks a little nervous
sky six reports a fresh company of nva moving across from cambodia to this blue line
points to position we got a good chance to light em up tonight
all platoons will set squad size ambushes before full dark
wolfe glances at him you bush in this area near that ol buddhist temple we passed on the hump in
hawkins you take this area in the rubber plantation
eager no problem sir
elsewhere chris scrapes out a foxhole his shirt off bandana around his head the work hot and heavy
tex is out there setting the claymore as big harold and junior start breaking down their cs
a whining high voice hey big harold gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man
laughes loudly fuck you bitch
cmon man didnt i do you right that time i give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit
tricky bitch reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit cept me so dont start your game playing with me junior
theyre both black junior with huge goggle eyes and a face of pimples and pockmarks his teeth yellowed and decayed some of them missing
harold is about twice his size about pounds a baby huey concentrating real hard on preparing his stove to eat with
youse a pig man
i hope manny get dat laundry gig for you do
de fool think hes gonna get it but he aint known for his thinking
hes a fool alright but you a bigger fool
hey whiteboy watcha waiting for dat hole aint gonna dig itself
chris looks up continues working as junior chuckles
hey taylor you dont know it but i saved your ass today
i killed a shit eating dog
laughing getting up that reminds me i gotta take a shit
you gonna wipe your ass dis time
yeah if you let me have your shirt
voice over as he digs somebody once wrote hell is the impossibility of reason
thats what this place feels like
i hate it already and its only been a week
some goddamn week grandma
checking his raw blisters the hardest thing i think ive ever done is to go on point times this week i dont even know what im doing
a gook could be standing feet in front of me and i wouldnt know it im so tired
we get up at a
hump all day camp around or p
dig foxhole eat then put out an all night ambush or a man listening post in the jungle
its scary cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause im new and nobody cares about the new guys they dont even want to know your name
the unwritten rule is a new guys life isnt worth as much cause he hasnt put his time in yet and they say if youre gonna get killed in the
nam its better to get it in the first few weeks the logic being you dont suffer that much
i can believe that
if youre lucky you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then you pull a hour guard shift so maybe you sleep hours a night but you dont
i dont think i can keep this up for a year grandma i think ive made a big mistake coming here
as he speaks we cut around to various shots of the platoon members on the perimeter shaving eating cooking playing etc towards the end of this voice over we cut
barnes moving towards the platoon pc
a powerful face a quiet angry fixed stare a thick trimmed moustache that helps conceal a network of plastic surgery grafts and scars
the distortion from the jaw up the left side of his face to his forehead punctuated by a severe indentation above the left eye where a bullet once penetrated his
walking with him is sgt
oneill as they join wolfe sgts
elias and warren at the platoon pc where theyre huddled over maps
warren is a black thin tall paranoid man with untrusting eyes silent and bitter
to all almost pleased about it we got boo coo movement
rd battalion just got hit kliks north of here
the men react with wary silence eager to elaborate yeah they had claymores strung up in the trees blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces
barnes inflects his next words at wolfe who is worried
yeah they got two lieutenants and a captain
barnes studying the map
to barnes who do you want on ambush sergeant
barnes doesnt bother acknowledging the question barely glancing at the lieutenant to him a necessary evil
everybody knows whos really in charge of the platoon
barnes flicks his gaze to elias
elias you take your squad and ill take tex and francis from your squad
to warren we move out in two zero mikes
concluding i thought it was oneills turn tonight
they all look at each other
oneill spits in the dust a freckled short red head with a hard worried face a lifer going on
morehouse and sal are short
fu shengs going on r r you dont want to send their asses out on an ambush
you got the fresh meat elias
to barnes they dont know shit barnes and chances are we gonna run into something
so what am i going to do
get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the world can get his beauty fucking sleep
hey oneill why dont you cool it you dont have to be a prick everyday of your life you know
fuck you elias
you get your men ready elias
concluding the debate no further argument barnes rises
the meetings closed
wolfe hasnt said a word looking as elias departs without a word
watching him fucking guys got years in and he thinks hes cochise or something
his resentment directed partly at the way in which elias carries himself the natural sense of grace and the dignity it bestows
on the very edge of the perimeter darkness coming down fast the men in the ambush patrol rustle into their packs all of them bitching
tex carrying the m looks up at the glowering sky
shit looks like rain
all night too
gonna grow mushrooms in your bad ass crotch junior
under his breath goddamn aint no justice round here you break your ass for de white man
gonna get our act together do some rappin wid de brothers change things
whats oneill have a nose up the lieutenants ass already how come we always get ambush
politics man politics
we always getting fucked around here
chris is scared nervous with his last minute equipment adjustments his pack obviously overweight for a night mission as he hauls it up
gardner the other new boy is jovial in contrast his wallet extended towards chris
hey chris i show you a picture of lucy jean
not to be bothered no
gardner shows him his girl
shes real dog u g l y and what makes it worse is gardners put the standard photo of raquel welch alongside it tits and all
but he misses the irony of it
admiring yeah shes the one all right
thats lucy jean
shes a waiting for me
nodding yeah shes real pretty youre lucky
gardner puts it away
elias appears alongside them checking their packs out takes out chriss poncho liner and other items
he carries a modified m with a short barrel and a collapsible stock
to both boys dont need this or this
youre doing okay
just stick close to tex do what he does
calling out to tex tex you got junior and taylor here on your position
tex is a sour texas ranger type chews tobacco spits
damn lias this guns boss
put taylor someplace else
chris feels the words like lashes on him
you got taylor
to gardner gardner you go with me to chris and gardner case somethin happens to you you get separated or lost dont yell out okay
well get to you
chris watching them
a smile in them
elias moves off a quality to the man that chris admires
a natural sense of leadership
okay lets move out
as he follows king on point out the perimeter
a single file
night is coming down
the tone of the jungle sounds has subtly shifted mellower more sinuous and certainly scarier
the file stops
king an experienced point man listens
chris carrying texs linked ammo looks around tense
behind him is gardner trying to smile starts to whisper something hey taylor
when hes abruptly shushed
the file moves on
gardners pack rattling a little too loud
a weird rush of cold wind now rattles the trees and the monsoon comes
a hard slanting rain sudden tropic
a piece of an old buddhist temple under a sulky moonlight now in a state of decay the jungle surging to engulf it
the men are setting up quickly and relatively quietly in the ruins alongside a miniscule trail
the rain is coming down harder than ever
chris and tex setting out their claymore mines raveling back their detonating cords to their position drenched
in the far distance an illumination round brightens the sky for a brief moment
various ad lib curses and directions are lost in the sound of the rain
at the ambush cp ace whipsers into his radio
a soft hissing sound
close on chris being shaken awake
taylor youre on
groggy uh hunh
the rain continuing to pelt them
tex hands him an infrared scope
suspicious you sure you know how to work the claymore
tex curls up as best he can in his poncho to sleep
dont catch no zzzs on me buddy or ill sling your motherfucking ass
you hear me
grits his teeth yeah
looking at his watch hey tex youre ten minutes fast
tough luck closes his teeth chris lets it go scans the jungle and trail with the scope
the pov is greasy and blurred
he puts it aside
suddenly a series of resonant snores crack through the jungle
chris starts then sees its from junior lying out there spreadeagled in the rain
chris prods him
bending low into his eardrum
junior never wakes rolls over with a growl
a pool of muddy water has formed in which a pair of buttocks sit
move up to chris still on duty looking at his watch drawn drenched pathetic rainwater coursing down his face
continuing his letter course mom and dad didnt want me to come they wanted me to be just like them respectable hard working making a week a little house a
they drove me crazy with their goddamn world grandma you know mom i dont want to be a white boy on wall street i dont want my whole life to
be predetermined by them
a large ripping sound as the wind blows down a big tree branch onto the jungle floor
he starts peering out
he looks at his watch again
i guess i have always been sheltered and special i just want to be anonymous
like everybody else
do my share for my country
live up to what grandpa did in the first war and dad the second
i know this is going to be the war of my generation
well here i am anonymous all right with guys nobody really cares about they come from the end of the line most of em small towns you never heard of
pulaski tennessee brandon mississippi pork bend utah wampum pennsylvania
two years high schools about it maybe if theyre lucky a job waiting for em back in a factory but most of em got nothing theyre poor theyre the unwanted
of our society yet theyre fighting for our society and our freedom and what we call america theyre the bottom of the barrel and they know it maybe thats why they call themselves grunts cause a grunt can take it can take anything
theyre the backbone of this country grandma the best ive ever seen the heart and soul ive found it finally way down here in the mud maybe from down here
i can start up again and be something i can be proud of without having to fake it maybe
i can see something i dont yet see learn something i dont yet know
i miss you i miss you very much tell mom i miss her too chris
he moves towards junior shakes him but junior seems to be out of this world
junior opens one dead eye
its your shift man
junior scowls swears looks around for his rifle in the mud
chris crawls back to his position curling himself up in his soaked poncho teeth chattering from the cold rain splattering over him
a long beat
he sighs the sigh kicking off the next image
chris jerks awake very suddenly very frightened
the rain has stopped
the jungle sounds are loud
cicadas night animals water dripping hypnotically from leaf to leaf
and the whirr of a million mosquitoes out after the rains chewing at chris face
he looks around startled
tex is asleep
junior is asleep
he looks at his watch
the mosquitoes are eating him alive
he buries his head in his green towel which he wears around his neck but he cant see
he moves again miserable from the bites
then suddenly the sounds of the jungle shift some of the animals dropping out
a different tone
a piece of wood is stepped on a rustle of bush
chris sees something lifts an edge of the towel to peek out
a shoadow of a figure is frozen there in front of him about yards
it looks like a man
but it doesnt move
chris his heart in his mouth tries to peer through it
its a bush
it has to be
no human being could stand that still
his heartbeats are up
the moments take forever
but deep down somewhere in his psyche he knows who it is
the figure now shifts ever so slightly and moves
it is a human being
oh my god
chris looks around
tex seems like a mile away
why doesnt anyone fire
he casts a desperate look at his rifle at his grenades encrusted with mud but in spite of all his training he is frozen with indecision and fear at the
sight of his enemy
the figure seems to whisper something back then turns and comes down the trail
now a second and third figure appear behind him all in helmets and packs
all coming right past chris position
chris is rigid with terror
pleading with tex to wake up but out of reach
he is about to have an anxiety attack his heartbeats so far up he is sure they will hear him
the first figure is now directly in front of chris on the trail looking left and right
a rattle of his equipment a creak of leather
the mans face now catches the moonlight and his eyes come around on chris
looking right at him
chris staring back hypnotized
it all happens very fast
the figure murmurs something in vietnamese
a flash of muzzle fire
a raking cough of automatic fire
a grenade explosion
chris is hurled to the ground helmet bouncing off scattered confused jarred
all hell breaks loose around him with noise and shouts
tex kissing the ground is yelling at him
chris not knowing what hes doing is fumbling with the claymore handles presses them
insert they wont give
he tries again and again to the squeeze the life out of them
tex is screaming at him
lunges over and grabs the handle from chris
clicks the safeties off and blows them
three explosions rip out into the night and one of the enemy is caught in a brief instant looking like an x ray his body lifted and swirling in the
air then enveloped in swirls of smoke
chris trying to keep up grabs his m lays out a stream of fire
the sound all around him is deafening
gardner freaking out stands crouched confused tries to run collapses
oneill throws a grenade wild
chris hits the deck
tex is now on the m machine gun yelling at junior who is cringing on the ground
he lays out red tracer bullets like laser beams then suddenly reels back whiplashed screaming
a grenade explosion rocks them
his hand and wrist are gone his face in the dirt
junior is fumbling around trying to stay down and help him at the same time
grabbing texs gun chris looking out to his front has no clue whats going on
except the fire is slacking
relayed shouts of medic
the firing has ceased
a silence punctuated by occasional shouts and fast moments has enveloped once more the cemetery
doc crashes through the bush kneels over tex who continues to howl in deep pain
freaked out easy tex easy boy
trying to sound calm but his voice is on the edge examinging the mutilation with a pen flashlight he whips out his morphine in a big hypodermic
next position doc over here
as he slips the morphine into texs arm
muttering at chris godamn
dumb fucker dumb fucker
chris watching suddenly feels himself dizzy instinctively runs his hands over the back of his neck
feels the warm blood there
a moan comes from his lips
junior looks at him
oh shit doc hes hit too
weakly im hit
barnes and big harold come hustling up
doc finishes tourniquetting tex cradles chris onto the earth his flashlight probing the wound
tex in background continues to thrash and moan
chris waits tensely for the verdict his eyes big with fear on doc who takes out his morphine
to barnes pointing at chris that dumb fuck didnt blow his claymore
chris hearing this
barnes looks at him
to chris its a scratch nothing to worry about
tell me the truth dont lie to me
the needle goes in
tex lets out this strange keening moan that sets everyones teeth on edge
to barnes he letem walk right up on us
he was sleeping on his shift
muttering weakly i was not
it was your
leaving to harold and junior self preservations the first law of nature
gotta learn how to work your shit taylor
watch me dont letem go into shock
texs moans are maddening and scary
barnes suddenly clamps his hand over texs mouth shutting him up and from way down deep in his throat chokes out the words
shut up and take it
take the pain
texs eyes roll wildly uncomprehending
doc and big harold looking at barnes wondering
tex is suddenly silent shocked
barnes stands an icy glare goes
junior scrambles over to texs side
doc runs off
big harold cradles chris his big black hands like a mother reassuring him
you gonna be okay taylor okay dont you start worrying now
chris looking up at him eyes blinking slowly dazed already by the morphine
hes very scared
do you know youre gonna die
do you feel like
everythings gonna be fine and then
bullshit man you gettin outta the field man
three hots a day white sheets dem pretty white nurses give you blowjobs too you pay em enough i heard tell bout dem white bitches
better save yo strength taylor
muttering darkly don babytalk him man
cocksucker fell asleep
they walked right up on us he don do shit
chris is gettin woozier feeling he is dying but starting to grin not caring about it anymore
yet he is nowhere close to dying
barnes stands over a moaning ripped up enemy soldier
fires his m point blank into the head
the soldier bucks and dies quivering
elias checking out a blood trail some distance away shifts on the shot looks back
frances manny bunny and king are huddled over another mangled enemy corpse
stripping the corpse thats no nva man
thats a chink look at em the cocksuckers six and a half feet tall
look at his gear good as ours
shit i blew my claymore right in one dudes face and i seen him walking around afterwards
what we fighting here vampires
elias comes up to barnes swiftly indicating the blood trail leading off into the bush
blood trail just keeps going and going but no body
how the hell did he get away
fuckers returned fire soon as we lit em up
hard core fuckin nva
they got their shit together
coming up to barnes sarge doc wants you
theres a problem with the new man
elias and barnes go with king
past chris and tex who are ambulatory and bandaged being helped along
as barnes passes the men look at him everybody quickly senses something is wrong
at one of the positions doc is working feverishly to knock the life back into gardner who lies there his shirt stripped off on his cottage cheese belly
a huge sucking chest wound
you know it because he knows it
the eyes do the talking numb terrorized yet strangely detached accepting not protesting or concerned any longer
most of the ambush has assembled and is watching chris moving in to see
doc is mumbling to him low key
choppers on the way gardner hang in there you gonna be okay
but gardner seems unconcerned
things are going on in his head who knows what
and in his eyes there are big tears rolling
then a morphine smile
a sort of goofy gardner smile maybe thinking about lucy jean who knows
to all take a good look at this lump oshit
motions to gardners body rmember what it looks like all of you
you fuck up in a firefight and i guaran goddamn tee you a trip out of the bush in a bodybag
out here assholes you keep your shit wired tight at all times
glares directly at chris and that goes for you shit for brains

police up your extra ammo and frags dont leave nothing for the dinks
hoyt junior carry gardner
muttering let de white boy carry his ass he this dude that got him fucked up
whod be hauling his ass if that was a brother laying there
elias follows barnes out of earshot of the others
mand be alive if hed had a few more days to learn something
barnes registering it just keeps on walking
chris is driven up in a jeep to his company pc marked bravo pc on a c ration box
its midday on a hot lazy afternoon few people out in the degree sun
chris company is on the outskirts of the base camp their barracks regulation wood canvas and fine mesh screening red dust everywhere bunkers down on the perimeter reams of barbed
wire and concertina a sand bagged mess hall and chapel mm mortar pits observation towers recoiless rifles caliber machine guns
chris gets out of the jeep stiff necked a bandage around it still in some pain
the first man he intersects is king carrying crates of beer
hey taylor whats in the breeze
in kings mild tone chris tries to read his standing in the platoon
okay got light duty three days

they advance toward him reluctantly
i got light duty sarge
doctor said to take it easy couple days
laughes aint that tough shit now
a wooden cabin with some half dozen seats built over half barrels cut from empty oil drums
a guy is in there pulling up his pants
chris king and crawford a california blond with a handsome honeyed look are sweeating heavily as they roll the barrels out from under the outhouse the smell of human waste
a hot midday emptiness nobody around except the flies

he grins finding their reactions funny
its also the first time weve seen chris crack a smile
you volunteered for this shit man
you a crazy fucker givin up college man
king has long sleepy eyelids and cats eyes a large pink tongue and big white edged cotton pickers nails a lazy gentle nature content with the world
didnt make much sense
wasnt learning anything
hesitates and why should just the poor kids go to the war and the college kids get away with it
king and crawford share a smile
what we got here a crusader
sounds like it
they pause wipe the sweat off
king lighting up a half smoked joint hitting a few puffs eyes shooting around making sure hes not spotted passing it to crawford
sheeit gotta be rich in the first place to think like dat
everybody know the poor always being fucked by the rich
always have always will
noticing chris is having trouble with his neck picking at his bandage
you okay man
neck botherin you

chris looking at the joint a little apprehensive
hes never smoked
go on whatcha gotta lose yo here now
kills the smell of shit anyway
the joint proferred
chris waits a beat shrugs takes it smokes
suck it in
now let it out
chris blows it out
dont feel it
king and crawford chuckle go on rolling the cans
dats what they all say
king crawford and chris pour kerosene over the cans at a secure distance from the outhouse
king lights it
the cans pop and start crackling
a line of burning barrels
rings of dirty black smoke rise against a soft blue sky
they watch stoned
chris turns to both of them
you know that night we got hit
ashamed fuck it dont mean nothing no such thing here as a coward done your best man next time ydo better
history man history
chris surprised at their attitude
the joint suddenly hits him a look in his face eyes looking around different
over at king
deadpans i think im starting to feel that stuff
laughes yo getting there taylor
you be cool now and ill introduce you round to some of the heads
what are the heads
laughes walks away with crawford later
chris alone breathes deep feeling the full effect
a relief against the long harsh hot day
we see lights on all over the camp sounds of music laughter from the barracks
king leads chris down to a specially constructed cellar like hutch dug deep into the ground on an isolated edge of the battalion perimeter
ammo casing and canvas are piled over it and sandbags surround it
from the outside very little sound can be heard as they go down through a trap door made of ammo crates
past a lookout adams pulling security hitting a joint but alert
king motions to him its cool
inside is another world
chris looking around amazed
its like a private cabaret for the heads who are there cooling out
boxes of food from the states beers whiskey bottles crates functioning as tables hammocks hanging from poles electric fans tape decks paraphenalia
the boys are all dressed up in their saturday night rags
the clothes are clean the headbands the medallions are out anything distinctive and individualistic
on the tapedeck jefferson airplanes go ask alice
to chris it is a new world
and rhah the resident head sitting there in all his finery puffing a huge burning red bowl in a three foot long montagnard pipe seems to be the lord of
final judgement in this smoky underworld
across his naked chest birds and snakes are tatooed
around his neck a black skull and white ivory cross side by side
on his knuckles love and hate are tattooed
in his eyes a dancing satanic fire
a poor rural southern white in his grizzled late s he could be a biker king
giving chris the once over
whatcha doing in the underworld taylor
smiling this aint taylor
taylor been shot
this man chris been resurrected
chris wondering what hes doing here
his eyes roving over lerner crawford manny flash francis hoyt tubbs doc other from the platoon about or of them
rhah eyes him back hands him the bowl
you lame taylor
you lame or something
smiling go ahead on smoke it man
chris understands takes the bowl
then smokes it
the contact fumes are almost enough to knock him out
he starts coughing
theyre all laughing
your shits in the wind troop
lerner replies his tongue hanging out in parody
back on you
looking at lerner with distaste if youre gonna do it man least do it right
building up to it his eyes shaking with conviction at the whole insanity of the world he neighs with all the venom he can muster
they all laugh and applaud
king smoking from the pipe passing it back to chris who takes another hit doesnt cough this time looking around wondering about these guys
i didnt like it
bah youre a child lerner
rhah dont waste time on you
they go on ad libbing with each other teasing doc whos fairly straight saying he wants to go to med school in the fall
a gynecologist man
francis suggests dats a pussy doctor man hes gonna be doctor feelgood man
theyre all cracking up finding every joke funny
as chris finishes his hit on the pipe looks up across the smoke already dazed surprised to see elias suddenly there leaning out of his sling in a far corner
of the hooch
a monkey is draped around his neck with silver bracelets rings a necklace like a sensual little egyptian whore elias playing with it spaced out in a sleeveless vest tiger
dancing eyes on chris he swings out the hammock comes over with the monkey
meanwhile manny has broken into a high falsetto snatch of blues directed at chris joined by big harold and francis all of them clicking their hands
oooh chris you look like you is high oh yeah he looks like he is high ooooh chris you know you gonna be that way all night oh yeah i
think that you are yeah
up now and up to par oh yeah
elias pulls out a remington shotgun jacks it to the rear points it at chris
put your mouth on that
chris does so slowly a little worried
elias takes a hit and blows it down the bore shotgunning it into chris lungs
chris staggers back coughing
everybody laughes hey dude you done had your ass blown away etc
elias smiles his big white tooth smile
then the worm has definately turned for you man
chris puzzled by this expression
smiles feel good
a sense of euphoria now yeah
no pain in my neck now
feelin goods good enough
as he sucks in a huge mass of smoke off the bowl
his eyes performing a funny little hop skip and jump as he holds it his face turning red
the monkey jabbers and jumps around on his neck worried
elias then blows the smoke out in its face the monkey hating it
the group laughes
i hear you got a dear john from your gal
told you she wasnt getting nuff from you
lerner looks up stoned out of his mind wearing a ring in his ear

he forgets it
a grass blackout
lerner urging him on
elias shaking his head trying to remember
elias snapping his fingers
that was it
repeating it dawn
king listening to the sound of it
the others nodding musing over it
in comparison to the darkness of the hooch a highly lit atmosphere attracting bugs
dusty gear lying around a disordered hooch loud and finger snapping country western music playing from a tape deck a well known tune circa
bunny the year old angel face totters drunk with a colt beer in hand over to junior the badass black kid with the zits who just lies there on his

wolfe wanders down the aisle beer in hand slightly lonely bypassing fu sheng the hawaiin and tony a mustached hairy browed italian kid from boston who are playing some kind
of dice game
they hardly acknowledge the lieutenant who stops by rodriguez the mexican american kid who is on his cot in his neatly arranged area writing a letter home with a pencil
forming his words with his mouth as always minding his own business
religious objects comprise his few decorations
amiable how you doing rodriguez
wolfe winks at him continues on to the poker game going on in the center of the barracks the main action
oneill and warren the quiet sullen black sanderson and sal play as ace the tiny radio kid and morehouse look on all of them drinking beer and bourbon chasers from
to oneill hows it going red
using his nickname shit cocksuckers got all the cards tonight
to barnes looks like youre doing all right sergeant
barnes raking in the chips is the big winner a light bead of sweat on his forehead and a somewhat glassy look to the eye the only indication he is
drunk his shirt peeled off revealing a muscular scarred body
yeah and i aint even cheating yet
the big blond kid have some kentucky windage lieutenant
passes him the bottle of bourbon wolfe takes a nip
nah i wouldnt want to get raped by you guys
what are you saving up to be lieutenant jewish
wolfe forces a smile glad to move on
there is a continual worried rodent air about him an anxiety a desire to fill the vacuum in his leadership with a false masculinity
catch you men later
as he goes oneill shakes his head after him
sorry ass motherfucker aint he
you think he gonna make it barnes
barnes plays a card glances a minute movement of his head
yeah thats what i figger
some dudes you jes look in their faces and you know they just aint gonna make it
barnes looks with some irony at oneill
the country western tune has reached a crescendo whine which now mixes into francis the baby faced black and manny green shades covering his skinny face lead with a high
singing people say im the life of the party cause i tell a joke or two although i may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside im blue
the hutch looks now like a turkish bath with minimum visibility the smoke fumes dense
they are all up dancing on their feet king tubbs big harold hoyt lerner crawford flash doc elias a few light gestures with their hands above shoulder level passing around
the grass pipes while they shuffle fingers clicking
the song smokey robinsons tracks of my tears accompanies them from a vintage tapedeck
since youve left me if youve seen me with another girl seeming like im having fun although she may be cute shes just a substitute because youre the permanent one
king and big harold wave chris into the circle and he starts swaying with them feeling as if hes being accepted into a new family
rhah watches it all puffing away on his magic dragon pipe the shadows dancing on the walls
it looks like a saturday night dance party
a yearning for tenderness for feminity for a moment of peace in this nightmare life
their eyes closed thinking of dance partners that cant be here tonight
singing their souls out
so take a good look at my face
youll see the smile looks out of place
look a little bit closer
its easy to trace
the tracks of my tears
an overwhelming degree heat
chris is once more on point a little better now but obviously struggling with a thick unyielding bamboo thicket that forces him forward in a caveman crouch
napalm jelly is hanging from the trees in great canopies of spider webs obliterating the sky
new years day
just another day
theres been a lot of movement neat the cambodian border regiments of nva moving across
a lot of little firefights ambushes we drop a lot of bombs then we walk through the napalm like ghosts in a landscape
chris working his way over twisted broken stumps branches
on the back of his flak jacket hes written if i die bury me upside down so the whole world can kiss my ass
the signal for silence
barnes edging up to him
doesnt see it
following barnes imperceptible movement of his head
the bunker dug into the ground and camouflaged with brush is staring right at him not more than feet away
chris is a dead man if
barnes checking the terrain signals radioman hoyt
barnes edging up to the bunker eyes everywhere
the tension builds
they come up to the edge of it peer in
barnes walks around it slips in from back
chris covers him other guys coming up now making a small perimeter
chris now starts to see things he didnt see
right in front of his nose there is a trench from this bunker to another and another
there is now in his view a complex of bunkers and thatched hootches and lean tos all blending into the forest
a ghost city
elias and others fanning out now careful
whispered conversations in the wind
chris moves past a rope with freshly washed laundry stretching between two trees clothes stirring in the wind
he looks up as king points out a treehouse then looks down as lerner whispers something and points nva rucksacks are laid out on the ground in an orderly platoon
elias goes down into a dangerous looking tunnel on a rope with a
barnes watching him
we sense elias loves the danger smiling
wolfe signals manny and chris out onto the two flanks
rhah and king explore a treehouse
rhah an experienced soldier seems tense moves cautiously expecting booby traps
warren cautiously explores another bunker probing a little tunnel in the bottom of it with a stick
bunny having a small frame goes down into it fearless
manny the skinny black boy with the coloured beads is out on flank alone smoking a cigarette humming
on the other flank chris also alone waits listening to the sounds of the jungle
he too is smoking a cigarette
the eeriness is everywhere
rays of morning light peeking through the cathedral dome of the jungle
elias climbs deeper and deeper into the hole a rope attached to his waist leading out to the surface his flashlight now coming around on a shaftway demarcating a tunnel
that seems to stretch for at least yards
the light revealing cobwebs all along it but tall enough for a small man
its quiet weird
chris takes his pants down squats
he thinks he hears something tenses
there is a soft rustling sound now
and as he focuses on it he realizes it is coming from very close to him
something light and sinuous moving over the leaves
he looks down
a bright yellow and orange ringed krait viper is crawling right between his two legs
it stops senses another life standing over it
chris frozen with dread
the snake crawls on pulling its long long foot body behind it
on chris eyes dilated slowly regaining his breath looking around everywhere now
elias moving down the tunnel fearless
we expect something any moment to come out and nail him but nothing does
his flashlight revealing a kitchen and an nva hospital set up
a hammock swings as if someone just deserted it
in another hammock is a dead man
elias advances cautiously
spec sanderson the big handsome blond kid is moving through an abandoned bunker
with him is sal a tough street kid with an intense face all whiskered
sanderson noticing now a metal box of caliber ammo u
marking half buried in the ground
hey look at that
he opens the case
official looking documents are inside they glance through them lighting cigarettes the search over successful they relax
a worried type leave it willya its gook shit
nah this stuffs important
he puts the documents back in the ammo case lifts it
its the last thing he ever does
the ensuing explosion shakes the ground obliterating both boys brances smoke and dust flying out
out on flank chris hits the ground hugs it
barnes runs up
black smoke sweeping through the trees
sal suddenly appears stepping out of the smoke stunned
the front of his body is soaked in blood from a thousand shrapnel holes his clothes shredded he stares at barnes dazed
both his arms are gone and blood is geysering out like a water fountain
he crumbles dead or dying
he runs over to sal gets a hold of his face in a vicelike grip enraged tries to yell some sense into him
directly to sal goddamit
are you fucking kids ever gonna learn
dont you understand how easy it is to die
the doc running up one look tells us all we need to know
wolfe shaken is on the radio with cpt
harris words garbled through the air trying to describe a primal horror
barnes moving through the wreckage sees severed limbs sticking in a sandbag
rhah crouches over a piece of leg tied into a hipbone and a rib
elias coming out of the tunnel filthied
elias coming abreast of wolfe
tell six we need engineers here this pos
is crawling with traps
theyre on their way
consulting his map theres a gook village half a klik downriver battalion wants us to move in and search it asap somethings going on
barnes is still there in the wrecked bunker squatting there staring as if his mind has disconnected for a moment
he reaches up touches his scars
the look on his face suggests he is deeply wronged by this tragedy that he is taking it very personally
chris watches him from outside the bunker awed
barnes notices chris watching him takes a breath stands
you gonna sit there and play with yourself taylor or you gonna be part of my war
awright saddle up lets go tubbs you got point
the men moving into jungle formation silently
chris walking over into line stops for a moment noticing a freshly severed eyeball partially buried in dirt staring up at him
he turns away sickened
there is no answer
the men in the platoon start to look at each other sensing more trouble
elias heads into the bush after him
barnes watches him go
francis his friend and tubbs and king follow
hey man whatcha doing
where you at
get your black ass back in here
out on the flank position where he once stood elias walks out looks
the jungle is silent once again
francis tubbs king follow
the others barnes lt
wolfe warren chris rhah
whispering loudly manny
their voices trailing off
bird cries come back
elias combing the ground for clues
chris looking on cant believe it none of them can a collective chill running through the platoon
the platoon moving downslope in the jungle their faces grim quiet deadly
king is on point
we had to get to the village before dark so we left elias with some men to keep looking and to wait for the engineers
but it was king who found him
about yards downriver not far from the village it was the end of the mystery
a moving shot approaching manny
hes trussed with rope arms behind his back
throat cut eyes startled open mouth shaped in a scream of terror
barnes the other men looking
barnes says it for everyone the motherfuckers
they come up out of the jungle onto the side of a cart trail where a tiny village overlooks the river
the village is poor a series of thatched hutches made of c ration cardboard and aluminum beer can sidings faint whiffs of smoke coming from cook fires
pigs and dogs wander about
an old villager watches them pass from his tillable plot smoking a cigarette one leg wrapped around his hoe resting no expression
the village which had stood for maybe a thousand years didnt know we were coming that day
if they had they would have run
barnes was at the eye of our rage and through him our captain ahab we would set things right again
that day we loved him a pig loiters along the trail rooting
bunny coming up on it with a smile
hey pig pig come here pig pig
the pig grunts
bunny leveling his shotgun fires point blank
a horrible squeal
chris directly behind him looks disgusted
tony suddenly points excited calls to barnes
there goes one
their pov a young villager fleeing down the slope
barnes doesnt hesitate nails him with a short volley of well placed shots
to tony check him out
he turns back into the village
troops fanning out over the village some two dozen villagers scattering to collect their children dogs barking
get em out
get em out
in another part of the village barnes hovers over a hole leading into some kind of tunnel
get out of there you fuckheads move
fires a warning shot
three villagers climbing out of the spider hole arms raised but not showing any emotion
barnes turning to his radioman hoyt and big harold accompanying
to harold putem in the pig pen
to hoyt theres more down there
gimme your willy pete
hoyt with reluctance in his eyes hands over a specially shaped grenade
barnes stands over the hole the grenade in hand
the three villagers who just came out of the hole yell from the distance to others still in the tunnel pleading with them to come out
barnes throws the phosphorus in
a muted explosion
then sizzling acidic fumes
a hideous scream from somewhere deep in the hole
hoyt watching is sickened
the villagers in grief howl and tear at their faces
hustling up to barnes sarge we found some shit
barnes going with him
the sun is sittin there hot and high in the sky
chris strangling in heat a demented look on his face staggers into a hutch with francis
threadbare poor a typical buddhist shrine in the corner motes of light crisscross through the poor matting and c ration sides
chris edges over pries up a floorboard flips it over scared
theres a tunnel inside
a long dark dangerous hole
get the fuck outta there
hey take it easy man
what about me
im sick of this shit man i m sick of this shit
they dont want us here
who do you think theyre fighting for
get francis doesnt recognize him in his rage
bunny now coming in followed by oneill drawn by the shouting
barnes stares down at a weapons cache buried cleverly underneath the ruce urns
ace fu sheng sgt
wolfe others are digging it out
its in white plastic wrappings a load of ak s rockets grenades claymores carbines flares nva uniforms
a real find
to barnes and over here theres enough rice to feed a whole fuckin regiment
barnes walking with him over to an undercover rice silo being dug out by tubbs and junior
barnes looks it over
to warren bring the honcho over here
to tubb and junior burn it
an old woman and her son a young man with one leg throw up their hands climbing out of the hole with stupid confused looks as chris shaking with his
own sort of confusion and rage cuffs them hustling them out
the young man uses a pair of crutches for his blown off limb hobbling like a mangy three legged dog
hey look at this
ma and pa kettle here
look at them greasy gook motherfuckers
get up out of there
you see i didnt wanna hurt you
why didnt you come out when i said so hunh
dont you listen
what are you the couple hands raised muttering things in vietnamese dont understand a word shaking their heads stupidly and smiling that impassive oriental smile which sends chris into a
rage only he can understand
his finger closes on the trigger of his
francis the baby faced black looks nervously sensing the danger
bunny amused drawn in by chris
oneill watches passively from the lip of the hutch
the young man continues to grin not seeming to realize the degree of danger hes in which is what chris wants a token sign of acquiescence
there is also the added element of showing off his manhood in front of an audience now
do em man do em
but he cant quite bring himself to kill
the bullets exploding in the dirt at the edges of the young mans foot
demonic the young man hops up and down in a reflex fear of the sounds of the bullets as they thud into the dirt
yet his eyes remain fixed on chris in wonderment
chris firing out the magazine seems to expend his bloodlust
he ceases noticing for the first time the eyes of the young man
they arent stupid nor fearful but filled with resignation and despair a despair that chris in disgust of himself recognizes
chris lowers the rifle silent
the young mans impassive face shines now with tears
that sad young look as if death itself wouldve been a release
chris turns his eyes away an awkward sense of shame
leaves lets get out of here man
but bunny takes up the slack moves forward on the young man
to chris you chickenshit man theyre laughing at you look at them faces
thats the way a gook laughs
the young man nodding affable to bunny and mumbling ingratiating words in vietnamese
yeah sure you are youre real sorry aint you
youre just crying out your hearts about sandy and sal and manny theyre laughing at us
their family is out there in the fucking bush blowing us away and theyre laughing at us
checking out the hutch forget it will ya lets go
chris standing there watching sensing something awful is going to come and unable to do anything about it
it comes suddenly and without warning
bunny is looking at oneill the vietnamese couple are muttering something
in one fluid move bunny swivels and with unbelievable savagery clubs the young one legged man in the side of the head with the butt of his
stunned hey what are you doing
the young man is groaning on the floor of the hutch
bunny smashes him again and again
thats for sandy
and this is for sal
and this is for fucking manny
this is for me
chris watches horrified
never in his life has he seen something so horrifying as this
and yet he does nothing
he is part of it
stepping back examines whats left of the head amazed wow
you see his fucking head come apart
look at that
i never seen brains like dat before
jesus fucking christ
the old lady is shrieking hovering over the body of her son
bunny studying her
betcha the old bitch runs the whole show
probably helped cut mannys throat
probably cut my balls off if she could
to chris come on man lets do her
she cowers from him
chris steps back horrified
as is oneill more puzzled than horrified
hitting her again lets zap all these motherfuckers
lets do the whole village
he backs out of the hutch scared
evidently bunny is temporarily insane
but he spots oneill yells at him
as he clubs her to death
on chris face blood and brain tissue flying up into it
a tiny knot of men are ringed around barnes who is questioning a sturdy looking man who is the village chief
he has been stripped of his shirt scars all over his body scared
he has his id papers out trembling showing them to lerner who speaks some pidgen vietnamese
whered he get these wounds
lerner translates the man talking back
he says he was hit in a bombing raid
hes a dink fosure
ask him what the weapons are doing here
he says they had no choice
the nva killed the old honcho when he said no
he says the rice is theirs
who the hell was the dink we just nailed on the riverbank
chris and oneill come up watch
others coming from different places sensing the narrowing drama
but half the platoon is still at work in the village
we hear shouts grenade explosions occasionally gunfire
he says he doesnt know nva havent been around in a couple of months
maybe it was a scout or
the men around barnes grumble
yeah sure it was
what about all that fucking rice and the weapons
who they for
looking at the village chief cocksucker knows what im saying
dont you pop
a blank look youre goddamn right he does
the village chiefs wife is now on the scene a middle aged woman with angry features yelling at lerner trying to answer for her husband a high pitched barrage of
indignant words directed mostly at barnes and interspersed with the spitting of her betel nuts on the ground
the village chief trying to talk her down
but things are definitely getting out of control
and the heat from the sun is only aggravating the situation pounding down on the actors in the drama their fatigues soaked in sweat and anger
finally he swears he doesnt know anything
he hates the nva but they come when they want and
hes lying through his teeth
waste the fucker then see who talks
whats the bitch saying
overwhelmed shes going on i dont know why are we shooting the pigs theyre farmers
they got to make a living all that crap
the woman is still ranting when barnes turns to her quite casually levels his m and puts a bullet in her head
she goes down as if pole axed
a stunned pause
the chief looking at his wife
the villagers in background reacting
chris looking shocked
doc possibly the straightest of them all very uncomfortable
they are all shocked insome way but do nothing against the power of banres
barnes walks over to the pig pen with the other villagers very casually confronts them
to lerner tell him he talks or im gonna waste more of em
lerner shaken up muttering to the village chief who is in shock kneeling next to the body of his wife muttering in a high whine of pain
go ahead lerner ask him
a group of villagers huddle to one side
lerner shaken is yelling at all of them demanding an answer
they dont know sarge they dont know
half believes it barnes turns his attention on the other villagers his intentions apparent
everybody feels them
barnes is unperturbed very much in command of the situation no rage no emotions expressed
chris has never seen such a thing in his life but cant react
cant stop it just watches it like hes not quite there
the same goes for lieutenant wolfe for all of them
the very outrageousness of barns killing seems to quell all protest
sensing the impending massacre hey sarge can we get in on this
tony advances the hairy italian kid from boston
lets go all the way lets go for it
lets do the whole fucking village
come on sarge
rodriguez next to him is neutral but willing
francis is hesitant
fu sheng and junior are ready to go for it
wolfe is powerless frozen
warren stepping up
the massacre is just about to break
the villagers know it kneel in prayer mutter
barnes suddenly grabs and drags a young year old woman the village chiefs daughter across the pen throws her down on her knees in front of the stunned village chief
this his daughter right
barnes pulls his
puts it alongside her head
to village chief you lie
you vee cee
i caca ado vee cee
he chambers the
the woman begging barnes for her life cradling his knees
he sticks the gun down above her skull
chris wanting to cry out to do something but cant
a figure suddenly flares out in the sun advancing on them
it is elias
barnes looks around
they all look around
elias walks right up to him followed by his men king rhah crawford others from the rear party
he looks around
the corpse of the wife
the young daughter sobbing
pissed stay out of this elias
this aint your show
the stock of his rifle swings up fast and hard smacking barnes full in the face breaking two teeth
barnes staggers back hurt bleeding
elias is on him like a leopard
battering him with his fists
they struggle in the dust two titans their faces equally consumed with rage clawing spitting punching kicking pounding each others skulls in the dirt
a dust storm swirls around them the men closing around like excited apes at a bloodfeast
most of the men seem to be pulling for barnes chris just watching neutral
but they rool on smashing each others faces in
both quick fast agile mean fighters
oneill and warren drag them apart
youre dead youre fucking dead elias
you youre going to fuckin jail buddy you aint getting away with this one
now break it they compose themselves the villagers looking on grieving over their loss
alright six says torch this place
blow the weapons in place
round up all suspected vee cees and shake it up
we aint got much light left
to wolfe why the fuck didnt you do something lieutenant
what are you talking about
turns away goes about his business spins him around you know what im talking about
no i dont
i dont know what the fuck youre talking about elias
goes who wants to be reminded
a silence of shame
the men moving away warren ace tony rodriguez barnes looking back once a cold glare
the village chief is a broken looking man huddled over his wifes body
elias stands there frustrated
chris glances at him moves out
a zippo cigarette lighter with the engraved initials from mai lin to my bunny boy
it sparks a thick flare as bunny lights the dry straw on the roof of the hutch where he killed the old woman and young boy
their legs sticking out at the threshold
the hooch burning fast aided by the strong sun
bunny watches with awe
warren and rodriguez lighting another hooch on fire
fu sheng yelling fire in the hole
throws white phosphorus into the rice stores
barnes and huffmeister a big german kid from texas are laying the cord to blow the weapons cache
adams and parker are poisoning the well with a white phosphorus grenade fire in the hole
wolfe ace tubbs warren rogriguez rope the dozen suspected villagers together to take them back for questioning
elias watches the villagers mourn their losses
in the background explosions hooches popping with flames the yells of the violations of the village winding down
chris wanders through this wreckage in the sun like a dazed visitor from another planet not believing it
he sees something goes towards it knows what it is
hidden at the edge of the woodline king hands back a bowl of grass to rhah the chief head
theyre puffing away
where that come from
growing in a garden
smokes sheeit beats burning hutches anyway
they meditatively look out at the village burning hutches sending up spirals of smoke
yeah stoneds the way to be
in a ditch running alongside the village partially concealed by foliage and anthills tony morehouse and the ubiquitous bunny have a year old vietnamese girl pinned to the ground gagged
and squirming naked
they are fucking her to death
junior looks on both curious and disgusted but doesnt take part
take her up the ass
as they roll her over like excited dogs in heat
chris coming up sees their heads dipping up and down on the other side of the anthill knows what theyre doing
he makes a conscious decision to do something
he runs over
he strides right into them shoves them off hard
the girl is in tears
what the fuck you want shes a dink
he seems disconnected dazed by the sun like hes talking to dogs loud repetitive words coming out of an anger he can barely control trying to restore some sanity to
a world gone totally nuts today
dont they understand
dontthey have any sense of a mind
any kind of decency
the men looking at him as if hes the one whos gone nuts not them
bunny looking at morehouse looking at tony looking at junior
the irony is lost on them as chris pushes through to help the poor girl put her scanty clothes back on
to the girl its okay
elias appears behind bunny and the others sees whats happened
he signals them to move out
get outta here
the men grumble and slink off quietly
elias watching as
chris helps her to her feet wounded in the intestines she can barely stand blood saoking in her nether regions
chris slings her up as gently as he can and carries her
as if to himself its okay its okay
near the pig pen a dozen suspects are being led away on ropes by tubbs warren rodriguez
the others left behind look back at their village in ruins homes burning livestock dead or scattered belongings thrown and broken in the dirt
babies wail the adults squat there on their heels watching with absolutely no trace of outward emotion
past this bosch like canvas chris carrying the girl walks dazed by the horrors of this long afternoon
the soldiers depart the village
a huge explosion now rocks the earth and sends a spray of smoke into the blue sky as the weapons cache explodes in stages that sound like the end of
the company is digging into another overnight perimeter on a ridge with a view of the valley where the village was
c ration fires all around the perimeter
at the company l elias captain harris barnes lt
wolfe are huddled
close on harris looking from face to face assuming a judicial attitude

barnes is obviously worried although he doesnt let on
elias a waterwalker

chris enthralled in spite of himself
he done a year in japan in the hospital then when he gets out the first thing he done is re up
four years he been in the field

well he aint normal thats fosure
thats what he is
his hand flashes forward in front of chris
hate is written across the left hand knuckles in a sloppy purplish black tatoo
chris looking at it
and hes filled with it
hes roaming these jungles looking for little yellow devils to kill
remember the devil does gods work too
pause and this heres elias
the other knuckle is out love tattooed across it
rhah smiles his crazy smil
chris stares fascinated at the two knuckles side by side
a moment on his face
makes a cuckoo sign here we go again with the crazy preacher stuff

love and hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul

youre fighting for your soul dats all
and its some goddamn battle too if youse a man wrestle with that angel
swings his entrenching tool in a rhythmic chain gang style love and hate the whole shitbang show thats the story then and now and it aint hardly gonna change
the stars are out in magnificent splendor
a breeze rustling through the trees
chris is turning in his sleep perturbed writhing
the whispering is more and more urgent
death is all around
he shoots up out of his poncho liner as if shot stunned
all is quiet
elias is huddled in his poncho on guard next to his foxhole
chris joins him sitting wiping the sleep from his eyes
i cant sleep why dont you get some sack time
dont feel like it either
i love this place at night
theres no right or wrong in them theyre just there
thats a nice way of putting it
elias cuffs a joint keeping its glow hidden in the dark
a pause both of them meditative
barnes got it in for you dont he
philosophically barnes believes in what hes doing
and you do you believe
what happened todays just the beginning
were gonna lose this war
surprised you really think so
elias eyes seem to go to some inner place his passion surging
we been kicking other peoples asses so long i guess its time we got our own kicked
the only decent thing i can see coming out of here are the survivors hundreds of thousands of guys like you taylor going back to every little town in the
country knowing something about what its like to take a life and what that can do to a persons soul twist it like barnes and bunny and make em sick inside and if you got any brains you gonna fight it the rest of your life cause its cheap killing is cheap the cheapest thing i know and when some drunk like oneill starts glorifying it youre gonna puke all over him and when the politicians start selling you a used war all over again you and your generation gonna say go fuck yourself cause you know youve seen it and when you know it deep down there
he plants his fist in chris gut expelling his breath such is the force of the blow like a power passed between them
you know it till you die
thats why the survivors remember
cause the dead dont let em forget
his eyes blazing reliving the deaths in the village licking the wounds for the platoon mourning the failure of its heroism
chris looking at him a little awed by his intensity
elias looks away embarrassed that he has sermonized looks back at the stars
sometimes theres things in my head
grass does that to me fucks me all up like a crazy indian
do you believe that stuff about
knowing youre gonna die
yeah those are the guys that live
i really dont think death gives a shit its like a giant garbage can i think it takes whatever it can get
you never know where its gonna come from anyway
so why spin your wheels
he shrugs a certain bravado masking his own uncertainty
you ever think about reincarnation all that stuff
a lightning quick movement follows
elias hand passing over his face like a mime a click of the fingers and he leans closer to chris
a new expression on his face
devils eyes mocking child danger in his soul excitement sex the elias that chris saw in the smoking session in base camp
chris smiles sucked in almost laughs and then the face is gone again
sure goes on all the time
maybe a piece of mes in you now who knows
but when you die really die thats a big return ticket
soft i like to think im gonna come back as
as wind or fire or a deer likes the image yeah a deer
he smiles at the thought
chris looks at him looks away
a shooting star falls suddenly and dryly through the cosmos
the platoon moves along a shallow stream bordering the jungle
a thick rain falls amid cracks of distant thunder
chris rhah francis big harold others are at the rear of the platoon their ponchos pulled over them like big sad grey tents
theres a holdup ahead and the men rest on rocks or stand
the rain makes a pointilistic pattern the men collages of grey their rifles slung upside down to keep dry
barnes is up ahead out of the stream bank on the radio
lerners on point resting in the shadow of a decaying old french catholic church from the th century
the jungle has long ago won the battle vines creeping into the cracks remnants of arches layered around the church at the epicenter
behind lerner is sgt
warren and his radioman
elias further back is checking out the jungle alongside the clearing noticing a number of old spider holes long since abandoned
he goes over and checks them
back at the stream rhah looking old and whiskered under his poncho hood lights up a roach puffs it
another crack of thunder
chris comes over sits with him on his rock
rhah passes him the joint
big harold pulls a leech out of his open crotch area
shit lookit this little fucker trying to get up ma glory hole
hey big harold put dat in your turkey loaf it wont come out your back end

the words carry over chris staring out at the rain feeling a leaden fatigued high
passes the roach down to a millimeter back to rhah who points to his face
you got one right there
chris feels for finds the leech on the edge of his lip cursing under his breath
in the stream on radio all right move out
the men start slogging on against the rain
junior is drinking from the stream as fu sheng passes
dont drink that asshole
youre gonna get malaria
shit i hope so
on point lerner moves out through a remnant of an old arch somewhat casual in his approach to point
hey sarge you wanna tell me which way or do i get to figger it out
warren picking up a quick azimuth on his lensatic compass points
lerner moves in the new direction
lerner moves away from the clearing working up a slight incline when the machine gun fire erupts out of the jungle spinning him throwing him into the dirt like discarded
the men are down yelling
suddenly an rpg rocket breaks out of the bush sounding like an atom bomb as it devastates the front of the platoon
radio talk is continuous now back and forth between the three platoon radios through the ambush
doc up here
more machine gun fire
over here we got
chris moving up with rhah and the others out of the stream they hit the ground next to sgt
oneill who looks pretty scared obviously not about to move
whats going on
shit they got rpgs on our ass
fucking ambush they was waiting for us to break trail
another rocket whistling in
a huge roar
trees shredded dirt dust rising
whos on point
lerner and warren
chris uses his m to lever himself up into a crouch and suddenly dashes forward passing rhah
where you goin man
chris tearing up
past flash the hip black head with the colored beads
hes dead torn and shredded his face and eyes stuff with dirt
next to him doc is frantically tourniqueting tubbs shot in the legs
chris keeps moving to the front as if compelled
barnes is laying out fire
goddamit you assholes get fucking firepower out there
to hoyt on radio get two bravo up here
get me a gun
to others spread it out
more to the flanks
look for a fuckin target
chris comes alongside francis near the point throws himself down
banging his head against his helmet as he falls
the incoming rounds are tearing up the front of the platoon
to francis wheres lerner
terrified out there man behind the log
a body moaning sort of moving wriggling as if trying to escape the pain
his eyes moving to sgt
warren lying alongside a tree calmly trying to stack his intestines back into his ruptured stomach
another rpg comes in
chris makes a conscious decision moves up bit by bit shielding himself with tree stumps ant hills laying out fire trying to get closer to lerner
francis following his progress bug eyed
fu sheng now comes up with his m harold his loader belts of ammo flapping against their bodies
he fires from the hip providing cover fire for chris then pops down
chris firing out another magazine crawls closer to lerner trying to ascertain if hes still alive
lerner can you hear me man
a fresh burst of ak fire rakes the area
lerner jerks spasmodically with the impact of the rounds
chris spots the sniper
in a hole in the ground
twenty five meters off
snapping the magazine out of his ak to reload
a live gook
chris tears off a volley at him but the gook disappears in the hole
this is the moement chris realizes it its now or never if chris intends to get the gook
hes got to make a move before the man has reloaded his weapon
he pulls his grenade pops the pin
he lets the spoon fly off activating the grenade timer as he humps to his feet and runs for the gook hole concentrating concentrating
that head is going to pop up any second with a freshly loaded weapon and tear his head off
chris wont make it back to the hole
the throw has to be perfect
he wont get another chance
he heaves the frag drops and rolls away
the throw is perfect the golden arc of flight from the outfield nailing the baserunner
it twists cleanly in the hole
the explosion muffled but deadly
chris scrambles to his feet a look of almost total surprise on his face
he cant seem to believe he did it
pointing his m before him he advances on the hole looking over the muzzle to see the badly mangled nva man twisted at the bottom
chris hurries over to lerner
hes in bad shape hit in several places vaguely conscious
lerner groans im gonna get you out man
youre gonna be okay gator
fu sheng laying out fire to protect them harold splitting off to get more ammo
chris getting lerner to his feet hauling him back with all his strength past francis
wolfe seems disorientated struggling with the rain water washing off his map trying to read the coordinates for an arty fire mission
into the radio redleg redleg
ripper bravo two actual
grid six four niner
four zero two
direction six one zero zero
dinks dug in bunkers

wolfe unsure looks up for the artillery

i dont know lias we got four down up there if i split you off we
elias grabs a stick urgent starts drawing their position in the dirt for wolfe
wolfe looks up relieved as barnes splashes into the cp group
yelling at wolfe and ace where the fuck is red platoon
tell em to get their asses up here
what the fuck you doin back here elias
round up your assholes and move em up front were getting chopped to shit
yelling back barnes listen to me
theres spiderholes back there points next to the church

flanks wide open dinks get snipers in these holes when third platoon comes up theyll get us in a crossfire with em
well shoot each other to shit then theyll hit us with everything they got
itll be a massacre
barnes looking at the drawing
sounds pretty far out to me lias
maybe but i seen it happen at ia drang in first cavalry and they cut us to fuckin pieces
back to barnes give me three men if im wrong i can still roll up that flank
a look take off but keep your radio here
elias goes stops looks at barnes
you keep pouring out that suppressing fire barnes
i dont wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me
dont tell me how to fight this fucking war lias you go crying to fucking brigade on your time
out here you belong to me
elias goes fast
more thunder peals
as the mm howitzers sounding like deep tom toms some three miles distant beat out their shells
an ominous sound
artys on the way
hurrying back to the front get that asshole oneill up here willya
fu sheng is laying out fire when he senses something looks up
the artillery shell sounds too close
getting bigger and bigger on the horizon
too big too loud
a groan of fear on his face then knowledge
a huge explosion engulfs him
its short man
they fuckin got fu sheng
barnes hearing it starts forward
another huge shell starting to whistle in on them
that fuckin idiot
this is about three times the intensity of the rpg
the jungle floor shakes trees splinter
barnes is knocked to his knees rimaces in pain
hoyt barnes radio operator screams out as a fist sized chunk of hot shrapnel sticks in his back
hes screeching frantically trying to shuck the radio from his back his fatigue shirt smoking
barnes jerks the radio off hoyts back knocks the man to his knees and unsheathes his bayonet
ripping off the back of his shirt barnes sets to digging out the shrapnel
morehouse is decimated by a third explosion chunks of shrapnel whirring like battleaxes into the tree trunks
big harold is tearing blindly away from the front helmet gone rifle dragging in the mud when he stumbles sprawling face down
he jumps up looks back sees now the wire over which he tripped
it takes a second to register
he shares a look with bunny whos already on the ground
harold goes for the ground the same instant the satchel explodes
chris further back dumps lerner with doc whos got more than he can handle
take care of him doc
doc looking at him a dark look of hopelessness
lerner is a mess groaning reaching for chris hand
dont leave me man
a look between them
taylor get your ass over here
hang tough gator
hang in there man youre gonna be ok
just hang on
feeling like a liar peeling the mans hands off him leaving him there looking numb
chris is shaken lerners blood all over him
he tears out after rhah linking up with elias and crawford
elias motioning them to hurry
another huge artillery round exploding out to the front
oneill scared out of his mind hugging the earth tries to crawl into a small cut in the ground but finds it occupied by a cringing junior
barnes rushes up out of the forest like achilles towering in his rage at lieutenant wolfe ripping his handset from him as the lieutenant reads off the coordinates off his
you ignorant asshole
what the fuck coordinates you giving
you killed a bunch of people with that fucked up fire mission
you know that
wolfe stares at him open mouthed
disgusted barnes hunkers down to read the coordinates from his own map into the handset
ripper bravo two
check your fire check fire youre short on our pos
i say again check your fuckin fire
from registration point add one five zero left five zero fire for effect
new incoming fire drowns out barnes
elias a defiant look on his face moves fast but cautiously back across the church landmarks
chris following then rhah and crawford
the rain has now settled into a mist hugging the ground
elias comes to a stop looks
behind them we hear the sounds of battle gauging their distance from the main body
the spider holes are still empty
but he listens senses something out there getting closer
chris looking at rhah
how does he know
elias points out an imaginary line across the breaking mist
stagger yourselves across this line shoot anything that moves
theyll be coming from here
team leader gotcha
one of them gets through its curtains
where you going
down along the river bout metres case they try to flank us there
third platoons coming up on our rear so watch for em
ill go with you
i move faster alone
a grin elias his pack stripped is gone like a fleet leaf vanishing into the jungle
stringing them out okay crawford over here
taylor down twenty yards behind that tree
barnes has finished correcting the fire mission hurls the handset back at wolfe a wild look in his eyes studying the incoming fire
makes a decision
lets move back link up with three
let the arty do a little work
to ace on radio ignoring wolfe push two alpha and two charlie
tellem to haul ass and re group at the church
tellem not to fire
ace transmits what about elias
we pull back theyll be cut off
he needs cover fire
looks at him like hes stupid ill get him
with a threatening undertone you just haul ass too lootenant
going to ace dont send bravo three up till i get back to the cp
now move out all of you
as he snaps his weapon onto full auto and runs off after elias in a crouch
a man with a mission
next to the church deployed in the jungle rhah looks on silent
chris in his position waits
it is so silent in comparison to the racket from the battle across the forest
the mist clings to the trees moist and lovely
then a flicker of movement sound
chris hears it tightens
his pov at fifty yards
an evanescence of beige and green uniforms moving towards him very fast scurrying
they look like headless ghosts
chris opens fire
rhah and crawford open up
a rachet of sound one of the fiures seems to go down then another but at this distance through jungle it is difficult to say
the firing just as suddenly breaks off and the silence returns
i got two of them fuckers
i got one
see them go down
like fuckin target practice man fuck you charlie
ho chi minh sucks dead dick
sees him stunned crawford the blond locked california beach boy lies on the earth hit in a lung having difficulty breathing moaning in a soft undercurrent
chris runs up on him
rhah runs up
looks like a lung babe
but youre gonna be all right you only need one of them fuckers
oh shit man i never thought id get hit i was
gagging stay cool
we gonna carry you out
barnes appears running towards them looking down at crawford at rhah
sarge bout five gooks tried to
came through right over there
we got three of them we
didnt you hear the arty shift
were pulling back
get your wounded man and get the fuck back to the church
indicating jungle but lias is still out there
ill get him
you get the man in taylor indicating crawford now
or ill article both your asses
chris and rhah look at barnes sullenly then reluctantly start moving crawford onto a poncho liner they use as a litter
move it move it
hes in his blackest rage the force of his words almost physically pushing the men to move out with crawford
barnes turns now to deal with elias
elsewhere elias stands silently listens to the forest
in the distance the firefight can hardly be heard
his helmet gone his hair hanging free he is at his best now alone
he hears it
somebody running through the jungle about yards boots on leaves coming towards him
he begins to move lateral to the sound
his steps unheard better at this than the enemy
three enemy figures now appear crouched and moving very fast with light equipment through the mist
elias swerves up in immediate foreground his back to us firing
all three figures fall
a quick glimpse of elias not bothering to stop moving to his next position
barnes moving through the jungle reacts to the fire resetting his course
like a hunter stalking a deer
suddenly theres more firing
then silence two more enemy lie dead in the jungle
a rustle of movement then a cry chilling jubilant a war cry
a pair of feet moving lightly over the jungle
a glimpse of elias
in his full glory
roaming the jungle born to it
barnes fixing on him moving
an nva soldier jungle whiskered dirty smart crouches listens looks to his partner
what are they fighting here
the first one mutter something sharp and they split fast in the direction theyve come
they get about six steps when elias suddenly rises up from the bush not ten yards in front of them his shots ripping into them driving the surprised life from
elias is gone
elsewhere another three nva stop turn and flee back from where they came
chris and rhah get crawford back to the church grounds lay him down
no activity around them
chris plunges back into the jungle where they left barnes
barnes moving stops listens
something is running towards him
but its hidden by the bush
he brings his rifle up smooth and quick waits then as the bush parts elias is standing there
looking at barnes
barnes sees him starts to lower his rifle but then stops
he raises it back an inch sights it
a cold searing look of hatred coming over his face
in that moment elias understands
quick as a deer he makes his move trying to plunge back into the bush
once twice three times the blast rocking the jungle
elias jerking backwards into the bush mortally wounded
a crime against nature
barnes calmly lowers his rifle and walks away from it
chris cutting through the jungle hears the shots
he stops listens
someone is moving through bush towards him leaves and foliage shaking
chris tightens raises his rifle
barnes steps through into his sight sees him
chris lowers his rifle
barnes walking past him as if he werent even there
elias is dead
join up with the platoon
shocked hes dead
you saw him
back about metres
hes dead now get going the gooks are all over the fuckin place
moving on quickly
chris has no choice but to follow looking back one more time
two choppers are coming into a lz in front of the church
the two platoons second and third reinforcing are being evacuated as quickly as possible one load men depending on the wounded after other
the choppers are spraying dust all over the place
a scene of chaos radio talk layering it
doc is out of supplies making do with improvised bandages etc
lerner goes by horribly wounded on a makeshift litter into the chopper doc attending holding the iv
chris catching a glimpse of him waiting to get on the chopper turning to look as hoyt and sgt
warren both wounded are hurried aboard on litters
the chopper lifting off
chris and others now running to the corpses of flash morehouse and fu sheng lying under dirty ponchos their boots sticking out
the ponchos are blown away in a burst of wind off the chopper blades revealing their faces dirt stuffing their eyes and mouths waxen figures
chris and the others lifting them and carrying them towards the next chopper now coming in
they throw the bodies on
tubbs and crawford both wounded now move past chris into the chopper
chris running back with king carrying a litter their eyes falling on barnes talking with wolfe and ace making signals under the roaring sounds of the chopper
shaking his head
chris and king looking at each other mute
they numbly start loading big harold minus his leg onto the stretcher
the third chopper is down now waiting roaring blades silhouetting off the face of the cathedral
a rocket blast suddenly goes off not too far from the chopper incoming fire
the door gunner signaling for them to hurry laying out fire
chris and king hustling big harolds pounds into the chopper
climbing in with him
wolfe barnes ace running in with them
the perimeter is bare
chris eyes flitting over barnes as he jumps in
the chopper lifting off as another explosion rocks the area
the door gunner sees something opens up
big harold cursing looks chalky but hog happy as he manages a glance down at the jungle
his right leg is gone
tears are rolling out of his eyes
man you gonna be in japan this time tomorrow big harold
yeah ise lucky dis time whats a leg to get the fuck outta here
at the nva eat ma shit you motherfuckers
he sinks back sick
chris eyes sudenly fix on something
he cant believe it
he shoves king points
king sees it
barnes is looking
wolfe sos ace
sos the door gunner
elias is coming out of the jungle
staggering blood disfiguring his face and chest hanging on with all his dimming strength looking up at them trying to reach them
chris shakes wolfe his words drowned out by the roar
the chopper captain looking down dips
his co pilot pointing
the nva are coming out of the jungle closing on the spot where elias is
incoming rounds are hitting the chopper
the door gunner maniacally firing
barnes looking down at the man cant believe it
elias is on his last legs now obviously being hit by the incoming fire of the nva
he falls to his knees still stretching upwards for life
the chopper captain shakes his head at wolfe
the chopper dips one more time firing at the nva low and fierce over the jungle
chris looking back in horror
the nva coming out now by the dozens from the treeline
elias crumbling to the ground
obviously dead or dying
we still got one on the deck
bring the gunships in
barnes drawing in
chris looking at him in revulsion
barnes sees his look ignores it all of them sitting there silent living with that final horrifying image of elias
the heads are assembled whats left of them
rhah king francis doc adam a quiet black kid and chris who is impassioned tonight
he killed him

barnes stands there silhouetted in the trap door looking down at the men who are stunned to see him here
he steps down into the hutch his face now lit by candle light
a bottle of whiskey in his hand drunk ugly sweating but as always with dignity possessive of his silence
he feels their fear in the silence enjoys it
soft talking bout killing
he totters slightly as he circles the outer edge of the hutch
no one talks
yall know about killing
he takes the bowl from adams smokes it

confronting chris he moves on taunting them all

pause very soft kill me
almost an appeal naked intense
rhah francis doc look away
king the biggest one there is about to say something but the moment passes
chris waits his anger on the rise
barnes takes a swigger from the whiskey then turns away contemptuously
i shit on all o you
chris slams into barnes rushing him off his feet
pounding his face solid blows
get that mother babe go
kick his ass kill that cocksucker
but barnes is too quick and very strong and takes the blows getting outside chris arm twisting and flipping him in a wrestlers grip throwing him hard onto his back
on the dirt floor
the expression of the men watching slumps their hopes dashed
barnes springs around on chris straddles him one hand pushing his face back hits him hard
chris grimaces groans helpless now
a flick of sound
a knife whipped out of barnes boot and pressing against chris throat
chris bleeding from the nose and mouth
rhah suddenly spinning into action fast now realizing what barnes intends to do
barnes is on the verge about to kill again
rhah coaxing him moving closer
youll do dinky dau in long binh barnes
ten years kill an enlisted
ten years barnes just climb the walls
dont do it
barnes eyes tremble in the candle light his scars ugly a spasm clenching and locking his facial muscles
then suddenly he is calm again very calm
we sense a man of enormous self control
suddenly he flicks his knife across chris leaving a mark below his left eye
looking up at barnes rising off him
the boots alongside his face
the men looking on the tension lowering
what do you guys know about it
he walks out
chris sits at the very edge of a huey chopper bandana around his forehead long hair blowing in the wind barnes mark below his eyes slicked out now like a
jungle veteran looking down at the village where the massacre occurred
the village is still a smoking ruin a few peasants and water buffalo straggling like ants to reconstruct
bunny next to chris pops his gum indifferent
barnes next to him shifts reads a map
rodriguez is praying his mouth moving without audible words getting ready for the drop
king is making last minute adjustments in his pack
bunny now nudges chris points
the church in the jungle where elias was killed is visible
an outline of the cemetery
uncomfortable memories play over chris face
they sent us back into the valley the next day about metres from cambodia into a battalion perimeter
alpha company had been hit hard the day before by a sizeable force and charlie company had been probed that night
there were other battalions in the valley we werent the only ones but we knew we were going to be the bait to lure them out
and somewhere out there was the entire st nva regiment
the battalion perimeter now breaks in the clear ahead
smoke grenades of various colors are being popped on the cleared lz
its not big its radius yards heavily sandbagged deeply dug rolls of barbed wire protecting it radio antennas sprouting from the cp and surrounded on all four sides by jungle
the first chopper rocking down whipping up dust clouds
chris jumps out moving out fast as the second chopper starts in
at the battalion cp the major confers with captain harris and two other captains
two nva prisoners are sitting on their knees interrogated by vietnamese kit carson scouts and a u
sergeant their hands tied
the scout slaps the shit out of the nva
all this is watched from a distance by ace and doc and lt
wolfe at the platoon cp
ace and doc are digging the foxhole the ace of spades in aces helmet band sharing the information with tony and francis
they caught em last night pulling some shit on charlie company
they found maps on em man got a friend at battalion says they had every fuckin foxhole here fixed on it
distances treelines our claymores trip wires everything

rhah comes up a walking stick in hand huge pirate kerchief on his head semi naked

with a snicker for ace and doc indicating a rough drawing in the dirt these two holes are yours

shrugs to himself right
passing ace digging the cp hole this is one time we could sure use elias
to doc some people say im wishy washy
maybe i am
maybe i aint
on the edge of the perimeter king puts out his claymore unraveling it back towards his foxhole intersecting men form the third platoon who file out on a night ambush
skirting the trip wires demoralized silent
eye exchanges but no words
chris sits on the foxhole watching the ambush go out smoking a joint by himself depressed
king comes in with the claymore wires attaching them to their detonators
their foxhole as are all of the platoons is positioned just inside the treeline bordering the lz so that they are quite isolated from the center of the perimeter where
they first landed
glad i aint going with em
somewhere out dere man is de beast and he hungry tonight
man what a bummer
ten days and a wakeup and im still dealing wid this shit fuckin etcetera and ad infinitum man the last soldier in the file recedes into the foliage

i remember when you first come out to the bush you was straight as a

king shrugs preparing his meal sings himself a snatch of song a good natured man

a friendship that was forever and is now over
they both sort of know theyll never see each other again

tony eating nervous watches him shakes his head

tony shrugs back to his food
on another foxhole barnes in full pack checks the soles of juniors bare feet

get back to your foxhole
a look in his eyes
very remote very cold silencing oneill
barnes walks off
at the lz king runs out gets on the last supply chopper with some other men
it lifts off swirling dust the last rays of daylight
chris watches from a battalion cp area waves back the chopper sound receding in the horizon the comparative silence of the jungle now creeping up on the perimeter
he turns and starts back to his foxhole
a man is watching him
hes sitting on a sandbag face in shadow
it startles chris something about him
a deep west virginia drawl
got a light
goes over reluctantly flicks his lighter cupping it from the wind
the flame catches a sudden uneasy expression in chris face as he sees the smoking man
we come around and see what chris sees in the light of the flame
a face that smiles at him like a deaths head a large ugly blister on his mouth whiskered pale but smiling
a sick man wouldnt smile like this but he is smiling too intimately as if he knows chris from way back
but he doesnt
or does he
perhaps it was the man chris first saw at the airstrip when he came in country
the same expression of evil of a man who has seen too much and died but still lives
chris feels an unnatural fear passing through him
the man stands sucking on his cigarette stretches
he is thin and very tall towering over chris
chris watches him wondering
the man never looks back a leisurely confident stroll
in that moment there is an explosion from way out in the jungle about a quarter of a mile
then another then small arms fire
chris looks knows
on his foxhole junior listening to the distant firing
bunny is introspective talking to junior as if he were his best friend although they have nothing in common
yknow some of the things we done i dont feel like we done something wrong but sometimes yknow i get this bad feeling
not all that shit the chaplains jamming up our ass bout the good lord
just a fucking bad feeling yknow what i mean
dont know why
i told the chaplain the truth is i really like it here
you do what you want nobody fucks with you
only worry you gots dying and if dat happens you wont know about it anyway
so what the fuck
chuckles junior looks at him like hes really crazy
back to the distant firing
pissed now fuck
i gotta be on this hole with you man
i just know i shouldna come
bunny finds it funny laughs
dont you worry bout a thing junior you with audie murphy here my man
at the company cp captain harris is talking urgently into the radio
bravo three alpha
send me a grid
send me a grid over
a young inexperienced voice screams back into the radio amid intense background firing filtered by radio and sounding disembodied
were pinned down sir theyre in the fucking trees
the trees ok three alpha calm down now son
im gonna get you a fire mission asap
smokell be first
panic lieutenants dead sir radioman look dead sir i dont know where the map is captain
theyre all around us sir
hundreds of em
i can hear em talking gook
calming him just spot the smoke son and tell me where to shift
well get you out of there
just hang tough and tell me where the rounds hit over
at the platoon cp barnes stands legs akimbo watching the jungle anticipating the coming fight as overhead we now hear the shells whistle from a mile distance passing above them
then pounding down into the jungle in the near distance
barnes turns glances at wolfe smiles
at the company cp captain harris is back on the radio
bravo three alpha six
how bout those rounds son
can you adjust fire
waits three alpha if you cant talk just key the handset twice over
waits silence then a vague murmuring becoming clearer and clearer
its in vietnamese
the radio is then bashed in the sound like thunder in the captains ear
he looks at his rto both of them shocked
in the jungle itself the enemy is moving
flurries of movement and sound blurred visuals
hands taping a piece of cloth to a tree moving on revealing a luminous arrow pointing left
figures moving past it
hands unraveling a thin wire waist high backwards
hands sliding along another wire
we now see a moving helmet with a luminous plaque on the back of it leading a file up the wire
to a jump off point about yards outside the u
a pen flashlight on a drawing of the foxhole positions
the nva moving out in several directions at once
on their foxhole chris and francis wait anxiously
overhead the artillery keeps pounding into the ambush area
now small arms fire can be heard picking up at random spots along the perimeter
the battle like a tide is obviously moving closer to them
oh shit me i wish i was back in memphis now oooh baby this is gonna be a motherfucker
chris says nothing
suddenly off to their right about yards a blue fizzle of light erupts
rat tat tat tat rat tat tat
machine gun outgoing followed by a sharp explosion
crying a figure thrashes up through the foliage behind them
a fierce whisper taylor
rhah jumps into their hole with them out of breath
whats going on
rodriguezs hole just got gets his breath okay here it is one we got gooks in the fuckin perimeter
dats it dats it
they got through alpha company
anything behind you dont identify itself blow it away
two air strikes coming in
they gonna lay snake and nape right on the perimeter so stay tight in your holes and dont leave em
flares now shoot up over the perimeter
reds greens yellows squeaking as they float doen on their parachute hinges throughout the ensuing battle
the perimeter is illuminated at spotty intervals sometimes arctic bright sometimes inexplainably dark til new flares shoot up
chris francis rhah all look up at the light and hug their holes even tighter feeling naked in the light
flares cut both ways
theyre probing us they gonna go up and down this line all night trying to get through
stay cool ill be back
runs out of the foxhole
chris suddenly reacting to a noise out front gripping francis and pointing to the sound
a body is thrashing towards them about twenty five yards not yet visible but a little awkward and lungy in its movement as if desperate
francis tense is about to pop his grenade when chris grabs him
loud whisper but the body keeps coming lurching now falling
come on man
then a fizzle of blue light as the figure hits their trip flare revealing itself to be large with no helmet and gasping terrified of the trip flare
its the ambush
calling out in here man
the soldier now runs in like a fullback going down for the tackle sprawling into the hole knocking chris and francis down beneath him
he is sweating terrified a white boy with an unrecognizable filthy face no rifle no helmet his fatigues torn all over
chris gives him his canteen his shoulder and neck hurting from the collision
the soldier sucks down the canteen
between gulps theyse all over the place hundreds of em moving this way
they wiped us out man we didnt have a chance
wheres the cp
points back there
the soldier struggling out of the foxhole
you guys get outta here
theyre right on my ass and they aint stoppin for shit
he tears off leaving francis in a state of incipient panic
he looks at chris
taylor lets di di man
chris adjusting position facing the front anger in his voice
francis hesitates stays
at the battalion cp the major is inside his bunker busy between his radio nets
to rto get me bravo
charlie company reports hand to hand on the perimeter sir
three holes are down
they need help
looks at his watch to his xo okay move two squads from alpha down there
wheres that goddamn air strike you bet your ass if we were the first cav theyd be here now
handing him the transmitter bravo six sir
just outside the bunker a master sergeant spots something in the flarelight
two figures with helmets running towards him at an angle
hey you boys
which company you
a sudden burst of fire cuts the sergeant down in his tracks and the figures fly by
soldiers in the immediate area spot them
a burst of fire
one of the running figures goes down
an explosion engulfs him
but the second sapper runs right into the bunker in a kamikaze charge the light from inside momentarily revealing a bulky satchel strapped on his person and the face of
the astounded major
the bunker explodes with a deafening roar
in their foxhole chris and francis look at the curling ball of flame stunned
in their foxhole chris points
shapes moving in the trees
chris blows his claymore handles
one explosion on top of the other out front
then return fire
flashes from a muzzle rak a tak rak a tak rak a tak the heavier sound of an ak
chris opening up with his
then being blown down by a grenade explosion at the edge of the foxhole
chris ears ringing slightly concussed
suddenly from down the perimeter there is the sound of a faulty loudspeaker crackling out from the jungle
a pidgen english the words mauled then a snatch of patriotic north vietnamese music played from a scratchy old record
chris uneasy looking at francis who looks terrified
the sound now of a whistle
two hoots then a sharp third
chris grabbing francis arm pointing
there is a voice directly out to the front of them muttering something in vietnamese no more than yards away but unseen
its like hearing a casual conversation from another room then the sounds of several bodies moving in separate directions encompassing the foxhole
to francis a whisper out of the hole
chris crawls out stops looks back
francis wont leave hugs the shelter
a fierce whisper goddamit francis
move your fucking ass
reaches in and yanks him with all his strength half out of the hole
francis finally sparked now moves out
both of them bellying it into the brush behind the hole
not a moment too soon
an rpg rocket whistling in
the foxhole takes a direct hit caving in whirls of smoke spinning off it
chris and francis look back covered with debris
they hear movement
shadows are swarming towards the foxhole firing into it to finish them off
francis grabs chris leg indicating they get out of there
chris hesitates a moment a decision made now in angry passion rises up and charges the nva
shadows scatter and tumble caught by his surprise close range fire
chris moving forward into them blasting agile his instincts finely tuned and totally insane in this moment of time indifferent to his life
he yells insanities pumping himself up with the adrenaline of courage
screams from the dark shadows they fall
chris smashing a wounded shadow with the butt of his gun down into the foxhole
he jumps back into it reoccupying it
blasting the dead gook
opening fire out to the front driving the shadows back
francis watching this amazed
after a moment of doubt he too tears back out to join chris in the foxhole unbelieving as he jumps in with him
joining in the frenzy then stunned again to see chris suddenly rise up out of the foxhole and charging forward into the jungle
he is now over the edge
charging off into the jungle in his position bunny is experiencing the same high as chris yells out at them
come on motherfuckers come on
junior huddled in the hole with him speechless and terrified looks at him with huge eyes
the guy is nuts
an incoming grenade explosion shakes the hole
laying out more fire come on you can do better than that
fuck this shit
i aint dyin in no white mans war
ise didi ing this motherfuckah
junior freaks out throws his rifle down and hobbles out of the hole on his damaged feet at an incredible speed
yelling after him get back here you gutless shit
a shape suddenly out of nowhere looms up fast behind bunny running at him
junior insane now with fear runs smack into a tree knocked senseless and reeling to the ground
bunny turning back too late
the crazy drug high shape is yelling something like diiiiikaaeeeeeee
and jumps right into the hole blasting bunny point blank in the chest
bunny struggling to consciousness at the bottom of the hole
a boot in the gaping hole where his chest was
bunny his eyes uncomprehending
a muzzle is jammed into his mouth breaking his teeth with an ugly sound
another yell from the nva trooper
a flash of orange red light
bunnys face blown to bits
junior dizzy from the blow to his head looks up
a yellow flare somewhere out there and a shadow above him digging a bayonet into his belly with a grunt
a long oozing sigh of belly gas
the shadow with the bayonet staggering blind without eyes holding his brains with his hands
barnes throws open the empty laaw rocket casing he has just fired off and charges forward with a yell cutting down another nva in bunnys old foxhole
jumping into the hole the bottom of which is a liquid pit of guts blood ooze
another enemy running in on him
a short burst of fire
firing into each other
barnes draggin him down into the pit with him grappling alongside the corpse of bunny
barnes uses an entrenching tool to finish him off
at the platoon cp small arms fire is all over the place the nva closing the ring
ace in the foxhole yells to wolfe
cant raise barnes two bravo two charlie nothin
get me six
nervously aiming his rifle as a man comes running towards them staggering
doc plops down out of breath drained bleeding all over his chest
theyre coming through all over
i cant do
i think hes dead
its awful theyre all dying
wolfe is stunned barnes his last crutch against the chaos
ace handing him the handset
send traffic or clear this goddamn net
weve been overrun captain were pulling back
at the company cp things are just as bad
a radioman is sprawled over a smashed radio
captain harris is in a bunker working the radios himself as his radiomen fire at yelling running figures scurrying all over the inner perimeter
furious voice bravo two six
goddamit where the hell you plannin to pull back to
theyre all over the perimeter
be advised lieutenant you will hold in place and you will fight and that means you lieutenant
at the platoon cp wolfe is astounded by the message
ace looking at him straight in the eye
youre an asshole lieutenant you know that
as he abandons his radio grabs up his and moves to an adjacent position
doc a quiet man up to now is treating a wounded parker who is now hit by bullets and thrashes wildly and jerks to a stop
he is obviously dead but doc goes on trying to finish the bandage
suddenly he goes beserk grabs a starts firing and yelling
at the company cp harris gets on the radio with the air strike
one of the rtos on a separate radio calls over
captain third battalion armoureds on its way with tracks bout kliks west
ignores it into radio snakebite leader ripper bravo six were gonna need you soonest be advised ive got zips in the wire down here over

watch my smoke to target expend all remaining

the transmission drops out
harris now looking up into the darkened skies
the planes in no way evident but theyre there
and theyre coming
at the platoon cp the nva are sweeping fast crouched using cover yelling
small fires are raging all over the perimeter
ace putting out fire is hit
the nva are coming over his sandbags
a burst of fire
ace goes down
doc has cracked up firing at anything indifferent to his safety
one of the nva goes down
the doc is hit in the side wounded struggles is hit again but keeps trying to fire
hes hit a third time in the jugular vein
nearby wolfe is firing madly at the oncoming nva
one goes down
a second is wounded yelling in pain
wolfe reloading his popping up too late
one of them is coming over the sandbags
he sees wolfe
wolfe sees him
in the same moment
wolfe hesitates frozen up
the gook unloads his ak a magazine worth into lieutenant wolfe who crashes down sprawled unnaturally on the jungle floor
a spasm shakes his body
boots run by
at his foxhole oneill peeks up out of the hole
several nva are darting through the jungle yards away coming towards him talking loudly to each other
he quickly slips back down in the hole entwining himself with the approaching nva clinking metal
the nva stop glance in the hole
something is muttered
they run out
oneill opens his eyes breathes
barnes swings his mashed m full into the face of an enemy soldier who screams and goes down barnes chopping at him with his club
his helmet is gone his shirt ripped to shreds his shoulder bleeding making his last stand against the hated gooks
nearby huffmeister is hit in the shoulder by a running figure and collapses into the bottom of the foxhole crying out in pain
the running figure runs past right into the full force of barnes swinging rifle
chris bellies into the area see barnes recognizes him amazed
an enemy fires taking barnes high in the left thigh
a patch of skin blowing off
barnes rigidly goes down on his left knee like a wounded horse
holds there staring into the enemy waiting for the coup de grace
a series of shouts and the enemy staggers dead as chris lays out a curtain of fire
a grenade goes off near him blowing off his helmet
dazed chris rushes forward firing from the hip sucked into barnes suicidal vacuum
he cuts down an enemy as barnes given a new lease limps angrily forward and tackles a wounded enemy trying to crawl away terrified at the sight of barnes coming
barnes lets out a vivid scream
and beats the soldier mercilessly half the stock of his m flying apart broken
chris swivels alert on his knees
no more enemy
turns to barnes his back to chris still beating at the dead corpse
barnes swivels instinctively off the corpse and for a petrifying moment chris sees a maddened scar of a face lips specked with foam
the eyes refracted in a red green flare overhead the pupils distorted into angry red points
for chris it is no doubt the most frightening single image he has seen in his life
it will be in his nightmares forever
the essence of evil wrath obsession anger fear hatred permanence he is paralyzed
barnes smashes him full across the face with the broken stock of his m
not even conciously for at this point his mind has gone over the edge and the entire world is his enemy
american or vietnamese it makes no difference as he strikes chris harder and harder
chris struggles moans his teeth and nose cracked
barnes emits another chilling yell an springs like a humpback up on his good right leg the left bent set to deliver the killing blow the mangled rifle pulled to
its highest arc
the phantom fighter jet comes now like a great white whale
one big beautiful monstrous beat of deafening sound
its silver and white belly hurtling low over the treeline in one giant leap of sound momentarily illuminated by a flare
then a monstrous roar of anger
the bomb ripping barnes off the body of chris and spitting chris across the jungle floor crashing into a tree some yards away
fade back in
chris fluttering his eyes
a sharp movement in the bush
his eyes fight their way open
soft eyes are watching him from behind foliage
a soft furry head alert rigidly still
chris fights his way up to his elbow in pain looking at the eyes
the head turns and in one fluid move bolts
like the wind
a big brown deer
or was it
chris will never be quite sure
but whatever it was it was surely a sign of grace the grace of elias
this he knows as he feels himself for the first time alive
and in pain
his left hand torn and bleeding shrapnel in his side cuts on his face dried blood caking him
looking around his garden of eden
a messy jungle floor
burned bush and trees
bird songs somewhere in the distance
it is the very crack of dawn a pink red sun casting long oblique light patterns through the trees
a holy light
chris pushes himself to his feet feels his weight and the pain
in the near distance towards the lz area theres the sound of armored personnel carriers grinding men moving calling out in americanese
but chris is alone here
he fishes up an ak from a dead nva
checks it a weapon
past scores of nva bodies
past the foxhole where bunny lays dead in the bottom faceless
looking over at junior bayoneted to the ground dead
nva everywhere around the hole some of them still moving badly wounded
chris looking around then noticing a movement a little further out in the jungle
then he sees who
the uniform is shredded the figure obviously hurt in several places thigh back neck hand but not mortally so now struggling to right itself dragging its face up from a
belly down position
streaked with dirt and blood we see barnes once again re emerging from the dead
chris steps over to him a solemn look on his face
barnes looks up begs
get me a medic will ya
chris doesnt move
barnes looks at him again reading the intention that has crossed chris mind
an expression of surprise crosses his face then amazement almost shock
fuck you in hell
chris shoots him
barnes is finally dead
chris looking at the corpse numbed no exultation in his expression
just cold satisfaction and little feeling left
behind him the sound of a big machine moving
a huge nazi flag on an antenna looms up in the bush followed by the great belly of a turreted dragon crunching down a tree for its breakfast
a big tough german shepard comes boudning at him sniffs followed by a flak jacketed monster man filthy and greasy unshaven face earring in his left ear death corps scrawled
on his shirtless flak jacket and a drawing of a deaths head he looks like a cross between a pirate and a hells angel
behind him a second monster man and the armored personnel carrier grinding its engine a human skull hanging from its turret
to dog bozo
get back here
his eyes passing on chris like so much meat
to chris can you walk outta here
the soldier pointing to the lz behind him as a sign he should go that way
the other soldier already stripping the nva dead as the apc grinds on into the jungle reconnoitering
chris walks out of the jungle head bowed nauseated mixed feelings roiling him
in another foxhole francis waits the sounds of the approaching apc cutting through
he thinks about it a moment
it must be fast
it must be a hard cold decision
he pulls out his k bar and with one last anguished hesitation drives it into his thigh muscle
francis yells out and collapses in his hole
in another foxhole oneill unscratched but covered with dirt waits tentatively as soldiers arrive at his hole
theyre a little awed by the sight of the tough looking oneill emerging from his foxhole like sgt
rock dozens of dead nva littered around him
you alone sarge
they all left me bunch of fuckin faggots
man you gonna get yoself a silver star
fuck the silver star
you got any booze
rhah alive and well is poking around the nva corpses with a long gnarled walking stick looking like a crazy johnny appleseed with his pants rolled up on his thin
hairy ankles and wearing a red bandana tied in a four knot around his head
as one of the apc soldiers carves an ear off a dead nva rhah works his way through the torn bloody pocket of an nva troop in full rigor mortis
extracting what he thought was there a wrapped cellophane of heroin
rhahs face glows with satisfaction as he tastes it then snorts it
with a certain satisfaction of triumph over the grim circumstances
to the powder yeah thats good shit
chris is hauled out on a litter
morphined his eyes watching it all from somewhere deep in his brain
passing groups of soldiers looking like bowery bums and moving like rats through the smoke and garbage snooping for souvenirs with wheezy tired eyes and grunts of greed
passing a bulldozed pit with heaps of nva bodies in them
a bulldozer pushing another set of bodies in like photos of a nazi death camp
nearby two burly soldiers lift a woman nurse and with a once through build for momentum toss the fresh body into the pit
chris numb goes by
into radio exhausted u
kia wounded and still counting
estimate victor charlie kia wounded and still counting
sir a television crews coming in with the general captain harris doesnt respond at this point he doesnt give a shit standing apart from the radios looking numbly at the
remnants of his boys filtering by on litters
chris intersects him now harris eyes looking blankly then nodding sickly trying to give him encouragement
just coming to the edge of tears choking it back and turning back
these are his sons who are lost
a good officer
rodriguez wounded is lifted up in his litter and moved out to the waiting medivac chopper a huge red cross painted on a white square
doc goes by on another litter then ace adams huffmeister etc
then francis is littered by bandages around his leg a big smile on his face
hey taylor you okay man

jes fine man jes fine

both of us two timers man were out
gives him a slap as he goes by see you at the hospital man we gonna get high high yessir
goes off the medic points to the chopper
to chris thats your ride man you ready
tries a smile you bet
chris starts towards it the medic assisting him
oneill watches the loading process forlornly from the distance
captain harris intersects him
you got second platoon sergeant
reflexively yes sir and as harris moves away oneill is left thinking
finally there is a certain frustration to his actions he has taken such great pains to stay alive that the tuition he pays is precisely to stay in this jungle
inevitably his time will come one way or another
his eyes now follow the medivac chopper upwards whatever is left of his shrunken soul yearning to go with it
as the chopper rises off the battlefield chris who is sitting at the edge so that he has a full view out the open door waves back at rhah
rhah at the edge of the treeline vigorously shakes his walking stick at him his other hand a fist waving them emitting his cry
dig me im rhah and there isnt nobody like me in the world
the chopper with its huge red cross painted on now rising to meet god
smashed on morphine chris looking out at the waving ants below
now the trees the skyline and the chopper is moving fast over the devestation
the jungle forever locked in his memory chris looks back copious quiet tears flowing from his eyes
i think now looking back we did not fight the enemy we fought ourselves and the enemy was in us the war is over for me now but it will
always be there the rest of my days
as i am sure elias will be fighting with barnes for what rhah called possession of my soul
there are times since i have felt like the child born of those two fathers but be that as it may those of us who did make it have an
obligation to build again to teach to others what we know and to try with whats left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life the music surges now to its full strength as we replay bits of film with each actors name listed some with silly clowning looks others sober haunted
gardner tex king rhah lerner sanderson manny big harold all the boys
and then barnes staring quietly into the camera and lastly elias shirt off bowl of grass in hand his big beautiful smile
