href b b the anniversary party by alan cumming jennifer jason leigh hes in his mid thirties his face relaxed in sleep childlike
nestled soundly a tangle in the arms of his wife
shes in her mid thirties with large deep eyes
she watches her husband unguarded in sleep
her pretty face alert shes barely breathing
traces the just visible lines around his eyes and mouth
brushes fingertips against his eyelashes
it retracts with a loud whack sun sky trees
were in the middle of a yoga lesson
joe and sally stand on their mats
steven their instructor wanders around the couple issuing soft spoken instructions
a large room with hard wood floors dominated by a huge fireplace
the dining room on one side living room on the other
floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch garden pool
the house is classic neutra
all glass and the calm is broken by the telephone
joe and sally ignore it until the answering machine picks up
they break their yoga poses and listen
the camera hovers over the answering machine
over answering machine sweet british slightly desperate joe its lucy
its the black sheep here
havent heard from you need you call me
love you madly
joe id love to talk to you before i go
over answering machine its a damn nuisance you arent here big brother
sorry i drone on
i miss you
i lo the machine cuts her off
joe and sally have resumed their positions
this wasnt the call they were waiting for
america forty one and rosa fifty struggle up the steps of the back porch carrying grocery bags and packages come through the sliding glass door
through the dining room and into the kitchen watches the two unpack groceries flowers etc
and start to dress the dining room table
they speak quietly to each other in spanish
america could you just
america closes the sliding doors between the kitchen and the dining room giving the couple their privacy
calls out thank you america
okay lets just take a deep breath let your ribs expand and relax
and reach up and into downward dog
otis the bisenji sheperd mix sleeping on his leopard pillow stirs stretches and groans
good boy otis
the phone rings again
over answering machine hello i have dr
harmon calling for sally therrian
sally jumps out of the down dog position and runs to the phone all angles
hello hi hi
sally stands with the phone to her ear her back to joe
joe watches her from his position not concentrating on the teacher waiting a sign
sally returns to the lesson
they do their handstands against the wall on either side of the front door
oh well well just have to try again
sound like a plan
sally nods she and joe at stevens instructions come out of their handstands and lie on the floor in a stretched relax facing one another
happy anniversary baby
and change sides
america slides open the dining room doors
the dining table is covered with bundles of freshly cut flowers
rosa is singing in spanish
with the authority of long years of service mr
joe we have to have the house
if you please now
the camera glances off photos of the couple portraits and candids their wedding day with friends on vacation tumbling on the lawn and the like
some framed and hung some taped to the fridge or simply leaning on a shelf
its clear that at least a handful are by the same photographer black and whites grainy and beautiful
there are lots of photos of joe and his sister lucy documenting their relationship from childhood
theres an annie leibowitz photo shoot of sally carelessly displayed somewhere
joe stands behind sally in front of the full length mirror his arms around her stroking her belly
i love you
most beautiful woman in the world
accept a compliment
i think youre the most beautiful woman in the world
they move toward the bed
what did you get me
in the morning after everyones gone and theres just us
she pushes him on the bed
kiss my eyes
kiss the back of my knees
through the sweats or not
she pulls down his sweats
she kisses the back of his knees
he turns stares up at her
you didnt kiss anyone elses knees did you
sally shakes her head
after a beat no
i missed that
i missed all of you
were okay arent we
i mean youre really back
they begin to make love
the phone rings
dont get it
well it might be clair
theyre threatening not to come
they cant find a sitter
into the receiver hello
yes uh hold on
she looks at joe just a moment
puts the call on hold its skye davidson
she needs directions to the house
you invited skye fucking davidson to our anniversary party
im sorry look i meant to tell you
it was the only chance i had to meet her
you invited her to our anniversary party
i didnt even invite my mother

sally im sorry
look i cant keep her on hold
pissed no no of course not
its skye fucking davidson for fucks sake
regards her you want me to uninvite her
no no of course not
how old is she
twenty fucking two
she gets out of bed starts into the bathroom
the camera is with her
into the bathroom mirror and shes a stinking fucking actress for fucks sake
into the receiver skye
his face lights im so glad youre able to make it
its our sixth actually
flattered you read the book again
well no the ending to chapter six
its just that its not filmic
we tried it in an earlier draft but it just wasnt filmic
well sure we can absolutely look at that again
if youre coming from laurel you want to take sunset west were just past will rogers state park
three blocks west of that you want to hang right
its about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left
sallys started the bath and is watching him from the doorway
he meets her eyes mid sentence
i dont think tonight
im sure theyre well behaved
all our friends have dogs and they always want to bring them
wed be outnumbered you see
so we sort of put a ban on it
he rolls his eyes
sally walks back into the bathroom she isnt buying it
im looking forward to meeting you too
and skye im thrilled that youre willing to take this leap with me
eternally grateful really
into the bathroom mirror im going to throw up
i cant imagine anyone else playing genna
the doorbell rings
there are two closed doors on either side of the room
the bed shows no sign of consummated sex
joe comes through the left hand door nearly dressed
who the fuck can be here at this time
its not even seven
sally comes through the other door one shoe off one on
oh jesus who else is always early for christs sake
sally kisses his cheek on her way to the door
promise youll be nice to the neighbors
ill say as little as possible
sally exits the bedroom
for a moment then sally re enters kisses him deeply
i love you
the house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements candles everywhere
jerry and judy adams are on the porch just beyond the glass of the front door
their argument is inaudible
theyre in their mid thirties conservatively dressed
shes stunning genetically nervous
jerry carries a briefcase
shes got the gift
sally opens the door
hugs and buses them hello
i know were early were so early
you have to sign your taxes anyway
a grin of course we do
to judy we have to sign our taxes
kisses judy all charm you can never be too early or too thin
happy anniversary buddy
six months ago who would have thunk it
jerry hugs joe
sotto well not me to be honest
sotto dont fuck up again
its got a ripple effect
sally suffers we all suffer
offers we have a gift
thanks ill take that
joe moves toward the kitchen
a moment to sally we closed
takes his hand out here
they step out onto the porch
judys left alone unsure whether to follow or not
finally to no one and to no response the house looks beautiful are those hydrangeas
she stands awkwardly in the middle of the foyer
joe officially owns no
cheyenne walk chelsea london england
no small doing
i love you youre a genius
behind them in the foyer judy wanders aimlessly
sally thats quite a gift
im not sure its in your best interest
i adore him
the realtorll be here tomorrow in the morning
the house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the london flat
i know that
dont spoil it
what you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in london its an outrageously expensive city
weve only been over this how many times
you only made half your quote this year
well youre a tower of support
i worry because you dont
its my job
im feeling guilty
i wouldve liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground
direct simple we couldnt be on more solid ground
whatever you say
listen i love you
otis is barking
touched and joes huge in europe
hes like a rock star in london
his novels sell millions
hes directing now
theyre paying him scale
the camera catches sight of joe behind them
he moves through the foyer and into the living room with a tray of glasses and judy in tow
he gets huge advances on his novels
hes going back to that
you know how he hates it here
theres still time to undo this
kisses his cheek well be fine
re barking dog did you invite them
and of course they said yes
that was the plan
and youre thrilled to have them
whatever you say
did you tell joe to behave
did he promise
before i forget
pulls a novel from his briefcase put it on the bookshelf
she flips the book on the back is a full page picture of youre out of your mind
just do what i say alright
how much bowing and scraping do you want us to do
beats a lawsuit
joe and judy sit on opposite sides of the sofa slightly uncomfortable with each other
to fill the silence conspiratorial grin i love gifts
what did you guys get us
chokes on the champagne nothing that cant be exchanged
congratulations on the deal
is sally doing sally
i mean its sally
the character thats based on sally
the character thats based on sally in the book
no skye davidson is playing the lead
oh my god im a huge skye davidson fan
shes very beautiful
yes she is
trying harder but i am right yes
shes based on sally
its a novel
lets drop it
im not much of a reader but i do love autobiographies even biographies sometimes
mostly non fiction
did you read the new styron
its very good
a moment i understand you won the booker prize
yes i did
another moment is your script much like the novel
jerry says its very good
but you know you read the novel and then you see the movie and most of the time you say whats this
i sometimes think were better off not reading the novel at all
because we come with expectations
and of course we know where were going
dont you find
dont i find what
i dont know why joe weve known each other how long
benign dont be silly
yes i know
i started to say
i started to say joe that do i put you off
you manage to throw me off balance
i adore you
and i you
but im always afraid ill say something stupid
and so i always manage to do you see
like the book script thing do you see
cal and sophia gold are there with their children jack and evie eight and six respectively
carrying gifts and totes with toys and changes
jerry and sally have gathered them up and ushered them in
you know jerry
yes of course
im the wife
hugs her you i know
to evie hey beautiful girl
she picks up the four year old swings her around
jack hides behind his fathers legs
a grin jack
jack you promised
the little boy comes out from behind his fathers legs covers his eyes with his hands
sings happy anniversary to you
were glad joe came home
dont split up again
cause we like the food
much laughter and clapping
in the archway jack
did you compose that yourself
had a little help
it has your ring
im not that good
cal my wife judy
nice to meet you
i think weve met actually
at another one of these things
no i dont think so
to cal congratulations on the academy award
he thought so
sally always manages to get robbed
a mortified grin enough about me
evie has a little something for you
evie shakes her head
even i dont think so
since when are you so shy
her mothers daughter never
bright smile honey we have gifts for you and all sorts of surprises
where is america
i know shes here somewhere
joe reaches for the gifts
ill take them
no i have a little talking to do with america
ill find her
to sophia in the kitchen
whod like to go and find otis
the infamous dog
hes the best dog in the world
to judy theyre both coming tonight
not my idea
its jerrys worst idea
the neighbors from hell
the kind that lay in wait
id rather move actually
to sally wouldnt i
small smile yes
to the kids okay
last one to find otis is a smelly old bum
joe goes off with the children to find otis
cal sits at the piano plays
joe holds evie in one arm
jack stands beside him holds his hand
monica and ryan rose face him across the threshold the next door neighbors
shes in her late twenties and beautiful eyes everywhere star struck and house struck
ryan is somewhat older a little awkward in company swallowing resentment and a little self righteous
well hello you two
putting evie down to jack these are the people who live next door
and close the door jack
because if we leave it open otis will run out and you know what will happen then
hell run next door into their backyard and hell bark and bark and bark and eat their pitbull for his dinner
is it a pitbull
not amused no actually
to jack oh whatever
we dont want that to happen do we
its a rottweiler actually
to jack i dont think our rottweiler is in any danger jack
well jack and i are very relieved
i thought this was a party
are we going to talk about the dog thing
kisses her cheek and shakes his hand no hes absolutely right
youre absolutely right ryan
dog talk must be banned
canine conversations are completely discouraged
its really good of you to join us
can i get you a drink
not for me thanks
an awkward moment
checks with ryan something soft
are you sure you wouldnt like something soft ryan
im sure yes
sally has watched some of this from the archway joins them super friendly
monica and ryan
and youve met joe
a deep breath well so glad you decided to come
we could hardly say no
joe slips the coke into monicas hand
takes the gift thank you
this was so unnecessary
i hope youve noticed that otis isnt barking as much
we keep him in at night
at today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes
i have it on tape
youre keeping a record are you
its just very distracting when youre trying to work
to joe im sure you understand
well the neighborhood is full of dogs and its not always otis
well today it was otis
and you should keep him away from our yard
because sheila will defend herself
cuts off response from joe to ryan are you working on a new book
caught short flattered well yes actually
he always has two or three going
joe cant manage more than one at a time
with huge gaps in between
mac and clair forsythe wave from the door
clairs arms are full of presents
mac carries three video cameras under his arm
hes got otis by the collar
you lose this
re otis ah theres our snookums now
yes well but i havent won a booker either
or the whitebread
the gate was open
well not yet
she reacts to mac the gate was open
its taken care of
i think ryan needs a new publisher
i think hes outgrown him
theyre just not doing their job
awkward smiles go all around
hors doeuvres or something
its a beautiful house
i understand youre an interior decorator
i so wish id known
well whoever did this is amazing
i did it
comes on them with the forsythes in tow she rarely cops to it
kisses sallys cheek otis is home
re the gifts where can i put these
sally takes the gifts from her
what a fucking day
we only just got a sitter
i dont know her from fucking adam
she could be a serial killer
im going to have to call every ten minutes
you have to let me give out the number
she already has
its alright isnt it
of course its alright
clair is a hovering mother
this is monica and ryan
mac and clair
clair takes a glass of champagne off the tray as they make their way down the hall
a wide professionally ingratiating smile so nice
and for us
you will never know
to sally i have a four thirty call
so we may have to leave early
why didnt you bring him
why didnt you bring him
searches hes allergic
didnt i say
they can tell from the eyelashes you know
hes got eyelashes yay long
they must be a foot long
the older you are when you have a baby the more likely this stuff is to crop up
the roses are happy to stand there on the fringe
next to someone theyve only seen on screen and magazine covers
clairs not in the least put off by them
she manages to smile at them inclusively from time to time
so they tell me
not soon enough of course
kisses her cheek how are you sal
you look fantastic
it changes your life you know
it puts everything in perspective doesnt it
doesnt it mac
you cant be the center of your own world anymore
as grounded as clair isnt its an object lesson in grace
on seeing cal gold on the back porch wow
look whos here before me
my leading man is on time for once
at the piano those who cant direct
mac and cal sit on the porch sharing a joint
cal is maybe the only living complete works of shakespeare and pulls out his most arcane quotes on occasion
are those our dailies
youre totally outrageous
its their anniversary
is nothing sacred
how am i
laughing oh man you are so fucking funny in the kitchen scene
i liked the third take the accidental disaster with the silverware
nothing you do is accidental
the camera spots gina taylor through moving bodies
tall beautiful centered grace
shes got a leica around her neck
drops her two large camera bags on the floor
several of the other guests greet her mac among them
joe sweeps her up to his arms
its an intimate appreciative embrace
theirs was a mid s relationship certainly pre sally
maybe his first important love
re the cameras im the hired help
affectionate fuck you
i never put myself in harms way
no not anymore
happy anniversary scout
sophia bursts from the kitchen
oh my god
america told me your neighbors are coming
and here they are
and she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over
because youre both so what introspective
and you should have done it ages ago
im sophia gold
rescuing sally come meet my husband cal
the very one
and you are
monica and ryan
she shakes his hand
hes amazed at the solid grip
hes a novelist
to sally where are my kids
in the guest room
ive laid out a paint table for them
i hope theyre watercolors
to monica would you like to meet my husband
its all monica can do to keep from putting her hand to her chest
id be thrilled
then hell be thrilled
she ushers them toward the living room
re sophia appreciative shes such pure evil
sally approaches gives gina a warm kiss on the chest
thanks for coming
youre a good match you two
to joe can you help me with this stuff
re one of her bags that for us
what a nose
you missed your calling
can i open it
go on then
joe rips open the gift
its a framed black and white of joe sally and otis lying on the couch
its clear which photos in the house are ginas
its a breathtaking print an amazing caught moment
all light and shadow
a touching study
respectful of the talent its beautiful thank you so much
joe moved somehow hugs gina to him
i love you gina taylor
sallys uncomfortable a little jealous
aware that gina got there first
knew him when
and always captures something naked and vulnerable in his face
in the center of the room a low table with paints and crayons and glue and baubles
two child size chairs either side
empty the table hasnt been touched
evie stands against the far wall
she wears a helmet and is surrounded by toy suction arrows
the arrows make a perfect outline of her head and body
jack stands three feet away bow in hand the archer prepares his next shot
cal is at the piano charming the neighbors
judy chats with mac
jerry is on his cellphone holding his palm pilot his hand pressed against his ear to block out the chatter
sally joins cal on the piano stool
sophia moves to clair on the couch kisses her cheek
you look so well clair
pleased you think so
ive been working out a lot since the baby
and ive been working
and that takes its toll you know
im glad thats all over for me
dont you miss it
not for a second
cal can have all that
so where is young jonah
with a sitter
we have a sensational sitter
jonahs really comfortable with her
you know a second mom sort of
like part of the family
amazing with kids
she inadvertently touches the beeper on her belt and it beeps
what is that thing
so this sitter can always reach me
im still not used to leaving him
you should have brought him
do you have any pictures
theyre always in my tote
i left my tote in the damn trailer
hes mac all over again
imagine mac shrunk to two and a half feet
the fact is they probably didnt even need me for this birth
are you the funniest person i know or what
i cant think how you gave it all up soph
sophia sends her a soft content smile
otis comes over and nuzzles clairs knee
freeks oh my god the dog
clair leads sally towards the bedroom
it sounds hysterical but otis just rubbed up against me and id kind of like to change into something of yours
you know it could be disaster
hes so allergic
borrow whatever you like
ill change back before we leave
pointed whatever you like
im afraid itll all be too big for you
a moment are you alright clair
well im a little stressed
and ive been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby
id say it was down
and the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy
ive got a ghastly headache actually
you want a tylenol or something
id love a xanex
a moment sally please dont tell sophia that im not breast feeding
why would she care
you know sophia
shes so damned judgemental
and shes so damned
and so fucking
just fucking dont tell her
because you know mac thinks shes god
and i can feel him comparing
you need to knock off the pills clair
just dont fucking tell her
its not going to come up
a peter sellers look a like holding a violin case
opens the door panes

sally starts down the hallway
for panes a long supportive hug a kiss good you brought your violin
i want you to play
its a machine gun
i thought id kill myself
are you lovesick
its much less codependent
will champagne help
sally takes panes into the living room where everyone chats drinks smokes
they all like each other out of habit if nothing else
ryan and monica are on the fringe stand at the edges of conversation
theres always someone at the piano and they can all pretty much play
panes is here
gives everyone a shy pained little wave oh great
everyone stops turns toasts
a little late into silence panes
panes gives them another little wave
shes the young beautiful actress wholl play the lead in joes film
his face lights up skye
shes in jeans but somehow looks dressed to the s

nods knowingly i recognized you from the book jacket
joe grins from ear to ear
uncharacteristically star struck in front of this beauty
how do you do skye

and i apologize for invading you
and im so happy you asked me to
im so touched
i know how private you and sally are

wonderful and lean and visual
im so happy you like it
im so relieved you said yes and im really um what thrilled yes actually to finally meet you

sally and panes have been watching from the living room

america and rosa are working at the counter panes and sally come through
oh jesus panes

skye bursts into the kitchen sally and panes freeze
stuck oh my god sorry

over sally come on in
im in the same room with sally nash
oh my god
youre my icon
ive been watching your films since i was a little girl
like four years ago i followed you all around the beverly center at least half a day working up the courage to introduce myself
joe enters the kitchen watches
i dont think i ever spent half a day in the beverly center
whatever do you remember
ive seen all your movies
when i was in rehab the second time they wouldnt even let us see your drug addict movie
they said you were too real
i worship you
and i couldnt be more flattered because i know the part im playing in joes movie is based on you as a young woman
joe winces uncomfortable picks up the bottle of wine and leaves
and im overwhelmed
and i want to do it justice
and i hope we can spend time together
and im gushing
its my worst quality
not at all
oh my god
ive been so rude
im skye davidson
has anyone ever told you you look like peter sellers
overlapping panes everyday
im levi panes
will you excuse us skye
its time for sallys meds
panes steers sally out of the kitchen
its nice to meet you
skye is left in the kitchen alone
to america oh my god she remembers me
sally and panes start down the hall in search of privacy
under her breath thank you thank you thank you
on the way down a dream in white my god your wardrobe is incredible
it took me forever to decide
oh and i found dr
x thank you
you saved my life
she moves past them
a moment sotto shit
re the dress id cut off her red wine if i were you
its my galiano
what does that mean
about five thousand dollars
with my discount
the camera follows them into the bedroom
they flop down onto the bed and into frame
more guests have arrived
sophia and her children play with otis
america and rosa pass round hot hors doeuvres
joe places ginas photo on the mantelpiece
regards him directing suits you
im not so sure
look again in three months
it must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden
gina you obviously need to get fucked
when does he graduate high school
laughing oh very jealous
i saw lucy when i was in london she seems okay
its hard to tell with her
shit i forgot to call her back
shes off on a trip somewhere
oh god my grandads flat in londons been sold
in cheyene walk
lucys going to have a meltdown
oh im so sorry
i should have damn well bought it
well we cant afford it
the movies going to eat up a year of my life and im getting paid next to nothing

yeah but i hear she gives a mean blow job
you really need to be fucked
so how are you really doing panes
why dont you go fuck yourself
im worried about your galiano
slaps him youre a shit
no really five thousand with your discount
he rolls out from under her swat she misses him
you hurt you know
youre stronger than you think
they lie prone across the bed about a foot apart
contemplating the floor
finally hows the movie going
you are making a movie arent you
i dont want to talk about it
i never like to talk about my work
well thats something new
not something new
well somethings wrong
its great okay
having the time of my life
macs a fantastic director
and what can anyone say about cal that hasnt been said
and its great working with friends blah blah blah
a moment little smile um
happy for you
so tell me hows it going
oh you know
no second thoughts
am i a monster
youre my best friend
thats not an answer is it
yes youre a monster
she takes his hand
sounds of the party come from below
a moment thank you panes
you dont need to thank me
another moment were going to have to go back out there
but neither of them moves
sanford jewison is at the piano playing his own stuff oblivious to the din
the camera gets a glimpse of ryan through the french doors at the pool alone a glass of perrier in his hand
monica alone uneasy starts to pour herself a glass of champagne
jeffrey gets to the bottle first
pours for her im jeffrey
and you know our friends how
we live next door
weve heard lots about you
lost you have
judy adams lost herself a little steps outside sits alone
smiles over at ryan hi
a little close in there
a small narrow room
not much more than an alcove
with space for a desk stereo equipment and shelves packed with cds
the topmost shelf is a line of record albums
joes picking through the cds
monica wanders in from the living room toting a glass of champagne
watches him for a moment
your eames table is incredible
and the b b
i just put that in a clients home actually but in red
youre an interior decorator right
nods sally did all this herself
in fits and starts and then later of course she had to accommodate me
so things shifted a little bit then became more eclectic
and it keeps changing
somehow at a loss mmm
it says something about the two of you maybe
yeah were in a constant state of flux
re champagne i see youve moved up from the soft stuff
you know ryans been sober eight years
and its difficult if i
its better if i dont
im a little nervous so
a little out of my element
no youre not
yes in fact
a little on the outside yes
and theres been all this friction
i dont know why but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating
very well put
i think a lot of this could have been avoided if sally made more of an effort
but youre very private people
you know theres a kind of elitism
the wrong word maybe
and you know the dog barks incessantly
and you know he really does not
and ryan works at home
and your phone calls are nasty and abusive
and ive come this close to suing you for harassment
and youre only here because were supposed to be sucking up to you
her eyes well with tears
well thats what ryan thought
i was more generous actually
im a total fucking maniac
delete all that okay
i spoke for myself this neednt rub off on my wife
i get pissy sometimes
much worse than otis
otis doesnt bite
its just i really love my dog and he doesnt really bark a lot
we live in a canyon
we hear dogs barking at night too
and its not otis
monica starts to laugh
it appears shes consumed more than one glass of champagne
please dont tell ryan im drinking
grins ill be your best friend
she feels theyve bonded
she pulls a well thumbed copy of joes novel from her purse
would you sign it for me
digs for a pen im sure this is inappropriate
were way past inappropriate
monica giggles presses back the bubble rising in her chest and moving toward her throat
manages not to burp
as he signs it ill treasure this
he moves towards the doorway monica at his heals
i need to leave you now
i will treasure this
shouting down the hall sally
sallys team prepares clues for charades
sally writes them down throws them in a bowler hat
her teammates are panes sophia mac ryan sanford and jeffrey
from jewish folk poetry a song cycle
ryan spots his book on the shelf and pulls it out delighted

evie and jake run along the side of the house
behind the glass walls the camera catches adults moving through the living room and into the dining room
most everyones moved through to the dining room
the table is filled with platters of beautifully prepared food
astrid newly arrived carrying a miniature furball of questionable breed is first in line and halfway around the table
she feeds anouk bits from the table enroute
barely looks up as sally comes into the room so who won
raises her hand a triumph
when did you get here
ten fifteen minutes ago
why didnt you come in
i hate the sight of blood
you guys dont take prisoners
charmed by the bundle in astrids arm oh how sweet
the furball bares teeth and growls
shes insanely jealous
she slips another morsel into anouks mouth murmurs baby talk allows the dog to take a bit of chicken from between her teeth
thats revolting astrid
people sit in small groups eating dinner catching up
latecomers bunch around joe
sam feckman an actor also in macs film holds forth

other arrivals pick their way through bodies and plates

joe pulls sally to him and wraps his arms around her
sallys never even seen it

sally held in joes arms smiles
the cat who ate the canary

and dad was having a go about the garden
something was misplanted
not properly watered
to gina you know how he gets
well he went absolutely bonkers
lucy and i were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and i didnt fit any more
it was almost fatal
and that my dear friends is the day
i realized i had become a man
youre not a man joe
youre a boy
laughs i love you joe therrian
at a loss small me too
sophia watches from across the living room
astrid squeezes in next to sally on her second portion of everything
she allows anouk to nibble from her plate
youre not upset that i brought the dog
would it make a difference
anouk isnt like a dog really
more like a small person
so is there anyone here for me
no one looks new
fixes on ryan whos that
you dont want that
its married and its the neighbor
oh i think hes cute
hows the marriage part working out
youre fucking desperate
like you didnt know
re skye who invited the bimbo
the camera stays close on the cake as america wheels the cart into the living room
the top of it sports sally and joes faces on either side of otis a detailed edible photograph

theres a freed up pathway
cal taps the side of his champagne glass with a fork
re the cake as it comes in part of our gift

theres a series of cuts through speeches gifts entertainment
sophia and cal do a well rehearsed very funny impromptu something with their kids
panes and mac do an interpretive dance symbolizing the marriage
cal and sophia carry sleeping children down the hall
there are speeches about sally and joe outrageously dirty funny sometimes touching that cover their recent separation the custody of otis their trying to have a baby
panes plays a piece on the violin
someone else sings
she looks out at the guests
they look back at her

ecstasy is passed from guest to guest
ryan expects monica to abstain
his glare simply i want to try it ryan
the drug has begun to take effect
the party is now in full swing
music is playing and sophia and clair are dancing
people are swimming some naked some in swimsuits
judy floats around the pool on an inflatable dog
sally and skye cuddle together on one of the benches round the pool chatting a friendly feely touchy conversation
joe passes around bottles of water and chewing gum to everyone emceeing the event
everyone is relaxed and open except ryan who sits beside monica at the edge of the garden separated from the others
i love it here

the camera follows monica along the side of the pool
she passes sophia and a very exuberant clair
the camera stays at the pool
clair tears off sallys galiano flings it to the ground and dives topless into the pool

sallys taken ginas photograph of them from the mantelpiece in the living room and looks for a spot for it on the cd shelves
sophia is studying the cds very intently
they are both bopping to the music
re the photograph isnt this a fabulous picture

joe on the other hand is a different story
laughs oh soph joe loves kids
joe wants kids
joe thinks he needs kids
he wants playmates
oh hes a sweetheart sal you know i love him
but hes not going to be a good father
hes just not parenting material
hey lets sit down
i bet the rug feels really nice against your skin
sally drops out of frame
dont try and change the subject
sitting joining sally oh god it feels great
hes just a little narcissistic irresponsible and unreliable
and cals this massive adult
cal knows who he is
did you notice how happy joe was when the drugs came out tonight
you werent exactly horrified
laughing i dont have a drug problem
neither does joe
his sister does
and the new york times says addiction is genetic ill e mail you the article
sally stares at her friend suddenly mute eyes wide
you dont have kids to keep a marriage together sally
its only five months since joe came back
getting up were fine
were having a baby and were moving to london
following her well you werent fine last summer when you went sylvia plath on me in connecticut
not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel
why are you doing this
his image of you is a possessive fragile neurotic
tearing up but i am a possessive fragile neurotic
also tearing up no you are not
youre sally nash
listen to me youre sally nash
youre my best friend and i love you more than anyone and youre not going to move to london to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man child
oh now im a novelist oh now im a director
english prick bastard joe therrian whos probably going to leave you for skye davidson anyway
they hug a bit weepy
hes always one step removed always looking over his shoulder always looking for something else something more intoxicating and i dont mean drugs
i love him sal but hes a child
hes not ready
a choked sob tears well and fall oh god youre so lucky you dont have kids
you cant stick your head in the oven
you cant take a handful of percoden if you want to or slit your wrists
you cant do yourself in
kids rob you of that option
a beat oh my god this ecstacy must be really good
joe and cal sit by the edge of the pool watching skye dance by herself at the far end
joe has his hand on cals chest
cal is stroking joes hair
isnt skye amazing
shes got great tits
shes a constant surprise
and youve only just met
yeah i know
but shes only twenty seven and
taps his head the wisdom
shes an old soul
she knew that shostakovich thing
did you notice
and shes got great tits
yeah god she really does have great tits great tits
i cant wait to work with her
the camera loves her
a great actress
with great tits
im going to ask her if i can touch them
he gets up to go towards skye is stopped by
clair is climbing up the pool steps
has anyone seen mac
pointing further up the property i saw him wandering over there i think
howre you feeling clair
im so good
she kisses joe and cal and goes off to find her husband
its been a bit of a struggle
im sure sallys told you
oh shes really enjoying it
is mac okay
i dont know whats going on
i dont care to guess
macs really unhappy
she isnt there thats all
shes no idea what shes playing not a clue
and you know it isnt rocket science this script
she can barely get the lines out
there was a scene last week she sobbed through every take
i know cryings easy for her but its a fucking comedy joe
you know that thing that was sally that always surprised you
i think shes scared
and thats death
i still think she sails above the rest
i mean not like her early films
but those were all such great directors
macs a pretty great director joe
hes a womans director
and nothings happening
course he wont fire her because of the friendship
but it was discussed
he had to battle his studio to get her in the first place
hey listen i love her
shes sophias best friend
to joes stare i never said any of this alright
ill deny it on the stand
into the silence you guys are gonna have kids
that is so great
maybe thats what this is all about
maybe she doesnt want to do this anymore
you know adults dont do this for a living
you guys are gonna have your kids youll be directing one asshole in the family is enough
sophia knew that intuitively
look at clair
clairs a mess
throws an arm around him make sure she gets the epidural
forget that natural childbirth shit
everythings going to be what its supposed to be
life is but a walking shadow
a poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more
and speaking of me the role of leo in your film
stares at him leo
any thoughts on casting yet
regards him leo
it was out to jude law
well i cant make any promises and of course i havent read the script but i loved the novel
when are you shooting
i have a small window of time
leos twenty eight cal
scratch the two write in a four
scratch the two write in a four
youve got a lot of fucking gall
five years ago i was at the party remember
joe looks up and sees sally standing in the sun room
he blows her a kiss
she kisses her finger tips and puts her hand flat against the window pane
shes in her wardrobe pacing back and forth a bit frantic
trying on clothing tossing garments to the ground
the floor is a heap of discarded ideas
she pulls on jeans and a t shirt
very similar to what skye is wearing
she sits a moment on the floor
the sounds of the party below are muted
oh warren that was awful i cant sing
the camera stays with sally as she gets to her feet walks along the corridor toward the sound of her voice
mac is on the edge of the couch elbows on knees staring at the television screen watching his dailies
at some point he drops his head
you sing like a bird
a bird with dropsy
a caged bird
that hasnt long to live
you seem so alive up there
sally stands at the open door
watches mac watch her
watches herself with a professional acute eye
more critical than macs could ever be
i was faking it
ive been feeling caged for sometime
moans no its not
fuck fuck fuck fuck
she backs up into the corridor mortified
leans against the wall
youre free to do whatever you like
yes well well see wont we
a deep breath well
clairs started down the hallway reaches the landing
sally rushes into the guest bedroom to avoid her
clair just missing sally wanders into the dailies room
oh there you are
what are you doing honey
no more work
dont you feel breezy
im in mourning
you can cut around it whatever it is
you always do
not this time
its always not this time
if you can do it around me you can do it around anyone
she walks in front of the television set blocks it with her body switches it off
an observation you dont have any clothes on
how nice for everybody
the waters glorious
re the film youll fix it
youll come up with one of your brilliant ideas
or i wont
i cant help her
im out of my depth
things always look much worse in the morning
i dont know how to make her funny
youre coming swimming in the pool and in a few minutes you wont even remember what its about
you wont care whos in your damn movie
really stoned what whats about
wait what are you talking about
jack and evie are asleep across the bed
sally sits at the edge of the bed regards the sleeping children
reaches over and smoothens the tangled tousled hair
studies their faces
monica sits on the steps of the pool
she looks frightened uncomfortable
are you okay
i dont think so
i feel a bit funny
lets go for a walk
he puts his arm around her and leads her away from the pool
ive never done this before
you just put one foot in front of the other
thats a good girl
im a little in the puke zone
giving her some water here drink this
drink lots of water
puts the bottle in her hand hold on to this
take deep breaths
nice and slow
sits her down produces a lollipop would you like a lolly
what am i five
youre never too old for a lolly
im having one
a grin okay
he pulls out another one
lemon or raspberry
lemon it is
the two suck on their lollipops for a moment
finally ryans really angry with me
i think hes really angry with me too
laughs its really not the same thing
a moment he was really nicer when he drank
eight years though
thats quite an accomplishment
thats a lot of those
a lot of cakes
and he doesnt smoke
he has to find non smokers meetings that used to be almost impossible you know
its gotten much better
how long have you been married
nine years just about
you must have been a baby
a moment im cold
joe holds monica
a moment thats very nice
i like you
im so glad
you know i recognize that passage in your book
the bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre
i know you changed it to a bookstore
and the color of my hair
but the moment was exactly the same
the same you know dynamic
and almost verbatim wasnt it
humors her yeah it was
for a writer nothings sacred
thinks a moment no nothing at all
i think its great that i made an impression at all you know
joe regards the open trusting face is touched by it
leans in kisses her lips very lightly
her arms cant make up her mind whether to come up around him or not
she appears beside them
someone left the goddamn gate open
otis got out
skye and i well the
i came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open
oh for fucks sake
nobody uses that gate
horrified im sorry
raging theres a goddamn sign on the gate
im so sorry
you fucking cow cant you read
at a loss how long ago was it
stop being such a bitch sal
im so sorry
it was a mistake
this isnt a plot to do in otis
dont be so sure
listen to yourself
to monica dont worry its alright
well find him
to sally whats wrong with you
re monica she left the fucking gate open
well he cant have gone far
cant have gone far
hes like a greyhound
he could be miles away
hell find his way back
there are fucking coyotes out there
calming sally calm down
were not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical
monica retreats backs off a step or two
america and rosa are cleaning up
ryan hangs around chatting
how long have you worked for the therrians
shrugs polite but annoyed a long time
so you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence
did you know the contractor
was it a contractor
its the way they do things
her back is to him
she exchanges a glance with rosa and the spanish equivalent of who is this wanker
did you see permits
did he have a license
you should talk to mr
monica bursts into the room
ryan youve got to come
youve got to help me find the dog
i let their dog out
we need to find the dog
youre not serious
i left the gate open and otis got out
he could get hit by a car
we have to find the dog ryan
regards him because were nice people and because what goes around comes around
desperate because god help you if something happens to that dog
all the ugly phone calls
were not the only people with a tape recorder ryan
a beat theyve gone to the canyon we should go towards the pch
panes and skye search the canyon for otis
they both carry lanterns
shostakovich identified with the jew
he felt persecuted hunted crushed under the thumb of stalinist imperialism
not to mention andrew zhdanov
how the hell do you know about andre zhdanov
who doesnt know about the infamous composers conference of where zhdanov persecuted the leaders of soviet music shostakovich prokofieve and myaskovsky
ill tell you who doesnt know cute girls dont know
do peter sellers again
a la sellers otis you crazy dog
otis are you in this god forsaken canyon
my people are very hungry
i just did a movie about bob yar i played gittle the jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head and they used shostakovichs th symphony
set to the poem of yetveshenko
so i dug it and i did a lot of research
do you really you really like shostakovich
would you like marry him
if he were still alive maybe
how about someone who really really liked shostakovich
smiling are you asking me to marry you
no im just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are
oh good im worse
are you really twenty two
who told you that
lops off two years five
sally and joe have lanterns
panes and skye are up ahead
we hear them calling for otis
on her heels otis
otis good boy come here
oh my god oh my god oh my god
this is a nightmare
we should have kept him upstairs
it was done
when sophia put the kids to bed america brought otis in the room and closed the door
it was done
well someone clearly let him out before monica opened the gate
oh fuck you and fuck monica while youre at it
but i guess thats what i interrupted
you are a medical miracle
the only person whos ever taken ecstacy and become angrier
yeah lets talk about that
you seem to be rather an expert
i dont remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties
thats so typical you would think it was called rage
what else dont i know about joe
lets get really clear here
sally so i took a few pills
i went out dancing
i tried to forget how upset i was about splitting up with you
i havent lied to you
i told you about the people ive slept with
i just didnt mention the few occasions i took drugs because youre so fucking judgmental i knew id never hear the end of it and you have so little faith
and so little trust in me
sally were back i love you
please lets not do this
im not sure we understand that word in the same way
you walked out on a five year marriage
that hasnt the first fucking thing to do with love
its whether we can live together
all the time
its not like this all the time
do i want anyone else
do i want to be with you for the rest of my natural life
and how hard it hit
just stop right there sally
weve been through this
youve been through it
thats how you love people
when its easy for you when its convenient for you
sally first of all youre talking bullshit
you want to talk about bullshit
lucy called you three times this week
shes a fucking mess joe
your sister is a fucking mess
she needs you
i talk to her more than you do
that is not true
it is true
you know how you love joe
you dedicate a book to someone
every novel ive had published in every language ive dedicated to lucy
and when was the last time you spoke to her
joe is silent
and how fucking dare you cast skye davidson in that part
have you any idea how humiliating that is for me
im an actress
its about our marriage for fucks sake
everybody knows that
its a novel
who the fuck do you think you are
the part of genna is not just about you
its about every woman ive ever loved in my entire life
including my mother
the character is also clearly in her early twenties sally
what are you saying
last birthday was
i dont look my age joe
sally i have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it
and you are out of touch with reality if you think differently
its a shit novel anyway
well there you go
i let you off the hook
youre one goddamn lucky actress
i mean your books have always been pop but this is the shallowest of the bunch
thats what all our friends think anyway
if we couldve by some miracle stripped ten years off your face still couldnt have got the thing made
because i dont mean anything as a director and your name doesnt mean fuck all anymore
and the people that can hire you are afraid to because they think youre phoning it in
that you dont have
oh christ sally
who thinks that
your director and your co star of your current movie
dont dish if you cant take it sally
mac says it
joe doesnt respond
sally for christs sake
this is insanity
moves toward her sally
dont push me away
i had an abortion two weeks ago
dont do this
i found out i was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me
threatens dont do this
i told you when we met i never wanted children
i dont want kids in my life
we talked about it
you werent listening
you changed your mind
i wanted you back
joe slaps her hard across the face
you think this was to hurt you
my god joe
it isnt about you
you aborted our child
im a monster
youre not ready
dont make allowances
ill never be ready
some people just shouldnt have children
id be a terrible fucking mother joe
i did want it for us
but i couldnt do it
i dont really think i can do it
i wasnt part of that picture at all was i
i wasnt part of that decision
did i occur to you at all
its a fucking farce
its a fucking farce
how long did you think you could keep it going
do you have any idea what youve done to us
ill never forgive you
i have no idea who you are
they stand their in silence
joe is devastated
we hear skye and panes up ahead calling for otis
of mac judy and clair
mac directs an underwater ballet a la esther williams
theres a sequence of tight overlapping shots of mac smiling swimming underwater
his image of himself
slo mo compounded by water weight
the drug has clearly taken effect
mac opens his mouth to direct his actors forgets where he is begins to choke and cough is clearly in trouble
oblivious judy and clair turn somersaults
mac begins to panic
he is drowning
he begins to sink
panic gives way to acceptance
jerrys body flies past frame splashes hard into the pool
the lens is water splattered
jerrys body sweeps past the lens smooth and sleek as a dolphin
he grabs mac
jerry pulls mac to the surface
clair and judy are out of the pool
jerry drags the limp body from the pool pumps macs chest its clear he knows what hes doing
mac coughs up a load of water
oh my god

mac begins to sob

the camera stays on mac as he walks around the side of the house down the steps through the basement
mac begins to tremble sob convulsively
he bites down on his lip clinches his first tries to pull himself together
paces at himself youre okay

joe listens to the answering machine message lucy left that morning
he plays it again and again
he fast forwards to his fathers voice
presses the stop button

dials phone a moment hey dad
cal and sophia bundle up their sleeping kids
the camera follows them to the landing as they head downstairs pass sally who is coming up

sally kisses cals cheek
panes and skye are fucking on joe and sallys bed
sally walks in on them searching for panes ear her best buddy
resigned oh perfect
jerry and judy lie alongside each other hands propping heads
they arent privy to anything thats happened
i call that a perfect day
a perfect night
long moment and a damn near perfect drug
we should do it again
just every once in a blue moon you know
a long moment you think we should ask them for their landscaper
do you like fucking out of doors
not as a rule
a long moment they didnt sign their goddamn tax returns
sally stands at the threshold watches cal and sophia load their kids into the car
clair and mac and gina hug and say their goodbyes to sally
kisses sally whispers take good care of it
count on it
monica and ryan return from their unsuccessful search
they come through the gate with its sight keep gate closed

we see judy and jerry bounding around the side of the house
jerry has his briefcase in his hand
they are laughing
they enter the kitchen
the camera stays outside
we see them brought up short by the gloom but hear nothing
sally and joe are at the table signing their tax returns
all is quiet
judys sunk into a chair
mornings finally come
light fills the room empty except for party debris
its empty but for glasses wrapping paper abandoned dishes of leftover cake
the bed is rumpled and indented from the sleeping children
their drawings and paints strewn all over the floor
the bed still shows the remains of panes and skyes love making
the camera moves through the suite into the bathroom
sallys in the tub
joe comes into the room in the buff
can i come in
sally looks up at the nakedness
he slips into the tub with her
they lie there facing each other
my plane leaves in a few hours
do you want me to come with you
a moment pretty much a disaster tonight wasnt it
life gets messy
but i dont understand you
and i dont think i ever understood lucy
i dont understand throwing it away
how do you throw all that away
any of it
i want it all
you guys want guarantees
i want the possibilities
and all kinds of crap comes with that
a lot of bad shit
and i think thats okay with me because because of the rest of the stuff
all the good shit
all the surprises
its a fucking miracle when you come down to it
a moment wed have had amazing children you and me
wed have had a ride
youd have surprised yourself
regards her ill never love anybody else you know
a little choked laugh me too
thats under lock and key
joe reaches out of the tub for gift wrapped box
he hands it to sally
its their ritual gift giving site
sally opens the gift
takes out a calder mobile
its a calder
hes my favorite
its for the babys crib
she hands him a small wooden box
he opens it takes out a set of keys
theyre the keys to your grandads flat
happy anniversary baby
oh sally mae
he cant say anymore
will you make love with me
she reaches out with both arms
joe and sally tenderly make love
its the dissolution of their marriage
america and rosa begins to clean up the debris from the party
a taxi pulls up
joe gets in with his bags
the cab backs out
the two wedding rings rest on the nightstand hers nestled in his
sallys hand opens the drawer sweeps the rings into it
the for sale sign is hammered into the ground
otis wanders along the street up the driveway and disappears through the flap in the kitchen door
