an original screenplay by john michael hayes may converted to pdf by screentalk www
ben mckenna at the back of a motor coach with their seven year old son hank
we do not see much of the background which is receding from us
they are studying the countryside from the windows at each side of them
the camera pulls back down the aisle of the bus revealing the other passengers
they are a surprise consisting of arab men and women with an occasional civilian and french army officer
the camera stops at the end of the bus
the french driver and a couple of his companions arab
the camera moves back to the rear of the bus photographing the side windows
at the bottom of the screen is the destination board
by the time we get opposite the window out of which the mckennas are looking we have been able to read the words casablanca ben and hank are looking intently
out the window
jos interest seems only casual
daddy you sure i never been to africa before
it looks familiar
shooting through the mckennas window at the landscape moving by
it is semiarid desert
a line of blue grey mountains in the distant
jo studies the landscape
we saw the same scenery last summer driving to las vegas
hank turns and smiles slightly

where daddy lost all that money at the cr hank
ben gives his wife a look of exasperation she smiles at him
hey look a camel
shooting through the mckennas window
the bus is entering a small arab village squat stone and plaster building narrow streets a few carts donkeys and one camel
a few pedestrians mostly arab men few women
ben puts his hand on hanks shoulder
this isnt really africa hank
its french morocco
to her northern africa
still seems like las vegas
slightly indignant were only a hundred miles north of the sahara desert
the bus is passing through the center of the town
we move past a few shops everything looking drab and meager
the sun is strong and hot
hank studies the scene outside
converted to pdf by www
in school they called it the dark continent
he squints its twice as bright as indianapolis
jo and ban smile at hank
just wait till you see marrakesh
sounds like a drink
ben runs his tongue across his lips
you bet it does
the bus rolls on past the arab village into the open desert once again
it looks parched and grim
tired of watching the sameness of the desert hank grows restless
he looks about for something to do
ben leans back against the seat and closes his eyes
jo takes a paper bound novel out of her bag finds her place
hank decides to wander down the aisle of the bus and test its possibilities for adventure
the camera dollies back with him as he rather aimlessly makes for the front of the bus
having left the arab village the bus picks up speed and is beginning to bump and sway somewhat
when hank is a little better than half way down the aisle the bus sways in a particularly startling manner causing hank to stagger
in order to steady himself he thrusts out his hand to grab the side of a seat
he misses the seat and only succeeds in clutching at the veil of an arab woman
unfortunately he pulls the veil from her face
the startled woman instantly horrified covers her face with her hands and gives a sharp cry with the bus still bumping and swaying hank staggers a bit without realizing that
he still has hold of the womans veil
converted to pdf by www
the woman still covers her face but from the seat next to her and nearer the window an arab rises and makes a sharp comment in arabic to hank
the arabs robes are brown with a turban like hat combining twisted strands of white and pale green cloth the arab starts to move past the woman toward hank repeating
people look quickly toward the sound wondering at the reason for the trouble
the bus driver scans his rear vision mirror for the source of the trouble behind him
hank looks up at the oncoming arab and retreats uncertainly not realizing he is still holding the veil
the arab in the brown robes begins assaulting the boy in furious arabic indicating that he wants the veil
two arabs and a veiled woman rise in their seats apparently disturbed by what the brown clothed arab is saying
they being talking among themselves
ben and his wife jo are straining from their back seat and looking down the aisle to see what is wrong
ben looks at his wife quickly and then back indicating that hank is involved
still staring straight at the arab both frightened and fascinated by his verbal attack hank retreats
converted to pdf by www
except for the french passengers everyone in the bus is in a state of disturbance
the arab continues to advance on hank keeping up a steady tirade of arabic
ben rises quickly and advances protectively toward his son and the oncoming arab
hank retreats and squeezes himself against his mother still with the veil in one hand
ben faces the arab who stops but continues his monologue for bens benefit
now wait a minute
wait a minute
the arab continues pointing talking
from a nearby seat a young frenchman in civilian clothes rises quickly
the camera pans him to ben and the arab
he pushes in between the pair
to ben pardon me
he turns to the arab moves him back a little sharply silences his attack and then begins in arabic to explain firmly that the boy meant no harm
it was an accident
the arab isnt convinced points to hank
the frenchman leans toward hank and takes the veil he is still unconsciously holding
he hands it to the arab with a sharp command to return to his seat
the arab turns away carrying the veil
as the camera pans him away we see the spectators resuming their seats growing quiet
hank and jo relax
ben addresses the frenchman a pleasant looking young man
he is louis bernard
converted to pdf by www
id like to thank you
without your help anything might have happened
smiles pleasantly a pleasure monsieur
there are moments in life when we all need a little help
may i introduce my wife mrs
louis turns pleasantly to jo
how do you do madame
my name is louis bernard
she returns his smile
thank you mr
and this is our son hank
he holds out his hand to hank who takes it
you talk arab talk
a few words
why was he so angry

half shrugs the moslem religion allows for few accidents
to ben may i be permitted to sit down
oh sure sure
next to jo there
pauses i thought his name was hank
oh uh converted to pdf by www
smiles thats my wifes name
louis bernard slides into the seat next to jo who moves over slightly
ben sits on the other side so that hank and jo are between himself and louis
in the rear windows behind them we see the retreating landscape of french morocco
called her jo so long nobody knows her by any other name
she smiles at hank rubs the back of his neck
now about the accident
you see a moslem woman never takes off her veil in public under any circumstances
they feed her intervaneously
louis looks at the boy with some surprise
quite a big word for such a small boy
im a doctor
well he sounds like one
he can spell haemoglobin but he has trouble with cat and dog
laughs and where do you practice doctor
the good samaritan
converted to pdf by www
jo seems to be studying bernard as if puzzled
what brings you to marrakesh
ben seems happy to talk with somebody new
weve been to a medical convention in paris
and while we were in europe i thought id like to see morocco again
daddy liberated africa
louis laughs a little
ben seems uncomfortable
i was up around casablanca with an army field hospital thats all
jo his been listening
she seems annoyed at louis bernards questioning

he smiles at her
to ben i suppose you came directly from paris
we looked in on rome and lisbon a few days
i hope you will have time to truly enjoy marrakesh

converted to pdf by www
you will naturally be stopping at the hotel mamounia or la menara
smiles they are hotels for tourists of good taste
the background as seen through the windows of the bus indicates that we are in a built up area
it moves through the outskirts of marrakesh a somewhat more populated section although the streets are narrow and crowded
a persists with louis bernard
do you live in france mr
do you eat snails
when im lucky enough to got them
if you ever get hungry our garden back home is full of snails
chuckles thank you for the invitation
thats all right
we tried everything to got rid of them
we never thought of a frenchman
even jo has to laugh at this and as the bus continues on into marrakesh the three see to be fairly good friends brought together by the artless charm of
a little boy

the bus moves slowly through the streets busy with bicycle riders arab women carrying things on their heads men on foot leading donkeys an occasional camel carts horse drawn carriages
carrying elegant moslem women and ancient french automobiles
the bus circles past the medina of marrakesh the market place with its crowds vendors shoppers beggars and the curious
it swings in toward the bus stop
the bus pulls up to a stop the door opens and the passengers begin to file out
the mckennas together with louis bernard are the last off the bus
arab helpers have already climbed to the roof of the bus to unload the baggage
the clean cut airline baggage of the mckennas is in sharp contrast to the hessianroped bundles of the arabs
there are nearby fiacres to take the people to their various destinations in the city and some small undersized taxi cabs
hank rubs his backside a little
next time take the train
to louis would you like to share our taxi to the hotel
thats kind of you doctor but unfortunately i have some business first
jo tries to be casual
what business are you in mr
but he has turned his head and speaks something in arabic to a porter who begins to gather the mckennas bags and one belonging to louis
louis turns to ben
however ill be there later perhaps we might have a drink together
converted to pdf by www
but ill serve the drinks in our suite

now thats not a fair bargain
but i know marrakesh
i can show you an intriguing arab restaurant where the food is different and the manner of eating exotic

simple one of those arabian nights
ben takes her arm in a warm gesture
smiles agreeably okay but im no scheherazade
how would you prefer to travel to the hotel
i want to ride in a wagon
he points out one of the open horse drawn carriages
louis looks to ben for confirmation
ben nods assent
louis turns to the porter and orders him in arabia to put the mckennas baggage aboard the first available carriage
he picks up his own small bag
i look forward to cocktails
he nods to ben and jo and pats hank on the head
see you later
and thinks again
louis smiles turns and casually strolls off toward the center of the market place
hank watches him for a moment while ben turns to see what is happening to his bags
converted to pdf by www
i dont like people who pat me on the head
turns to jo the carriage awaits madame
jo turns from the retreating louis and steers hank toward ben the camera pans them to the fiacre
the mckennas follow their baggage aboard the carriage
ben settles the excited hank into his seat
how do you like this
a horse drawn convertible
jo looks toward the market place and something she sees makes her eyes widen with surprise
as seen from jos viewpoint over the side of the carriage
the frenchman louis bernard is talking wit the arab in the brown robes and white and green hat
the same arab who was assaulting hank verbally on the bus
they are talking pleasantly and smiling
jo turns to call bens attention to it when there is a sudden crack of a whip a shouted command to the horse and the carriage starts of with an
it throws her head back
hank screams with delight
here we go
the carriage moves into the street with a rapid pace
jo looks again to find louis bernard
louis bernard and the arab have disappeared
converted to pdf by www
jo slumps back into the seat trying to evaluate whit she his seen
the market place recedes in the background
hank is now standing up holding on to the side of the carriage and watching the sights
ben i just saw louis bernard talking to that arab
the one who was shouting at hank for taking the womans veil
he and the frenchman were talking like old friends
lets assume they knew each other and louis bernard didnt bother to tell us
what does that mean
it means mr
bernard is a very mysterious man
he struck me as quite normal what do you know about him
i know his name
and he knows you re an american living in indianapolis indiana
a doctor at the good samaritan
you have a garden with snails a wife a boy who can spell haemoglobin
you went to a medical convention in paris

what difference does it make
i have nothing to hide
i know this is mysterious morocco
inscrutable natives gliding through twisted narrow streets but irritated at not being taken seriously oh ben
youre just mad because he didnt ask any questions about you
she looks at him briefly without any expression
then she malts into a smile
bitter medicine doctor
but ill swallow it
the carriage swings into the driveway of the hotel mamounia
it is a rich looking building elegantly landscaped
the camera pans it to the entrance of the hotel
several hotel employees move quickly to meet it
they help the mckennas descend and assemble the baggage
jo and hank look at the hotel
this eases the pain
what pain mummy
just an expression
ben beckons the porter
bon jour monsieur

the man is dressed in a dark grey flannel suit
the woman wears a light weight two piece sweater and skirt she catches sight of jo mckenna
the man with her beckons to a porter
they are mr
est ce que vous etes libre
jo looks at the couple then looks quickly away
with a marked glance at jo mckenna the woman whispers something to the man
he follows her glance
ben reaches for hank and the mckennas move into the hotel
as they move past the camera jo plucks at bens arm
were being watched
oh come on
ben gives her a look of affectionate exasperation and pushes her ahead of him into the hotel
the camera pans back to the couple left standing outside
the woman is still looking after jo mckenna

it is now evening and we are in the double bedroom and single bedroom of the mckennas in the hotel mamounia
we are able to see through into the single room where hank is brushing his teeth while his mother supervises his getting ready for bed
jo is already dressed for the evening in a smart looking outfit
ben is by the chest of drawers and mirror
he just lust finished putting on his shirt
at the far end of the room there is a balcony over looking the hotel gardens
by a small table stands louis bernard dressed with unobtrusive good taste
he is looking into the garden beyond
on the table are glasses and a shaker of martinis
in the single room occupied by hank
jo is putting his clothes away
hank having brushed his teeth and rinsed his mouth emerges from the bathroom
he wears pajamas but still has his shoos on
how about it mummy
im a little out of form hank

heres what she said to me jo takes up the song
her voice is obviously professional but beyond that quite beautiful
que sera sera whatever will be will be the futures not ours to see que sera sera what will be will be que sera sera
louis bernard looks up with some surprise fascinated and delighted with jos singing ability
ben who is putting on his tie pauses and listens
there is a slight smile of pleasure and affection on his face
hanks voice comes over when i was just a child in school i asked my teacher what should i try should i paint pictures

que sera sera whatever will be will be the futures not ours to see que sera sera
what will be will be que sera sera
just before they finish the song there is a loud knocking at the outside door
the song trails off
disgusted there goes our sock finish
ben goes to the door tightening his tie on the way
he opens it
a waiter is there with a tray of food
dinaire for thee boy
pointing right in there
the waiter heads for the single bedroom as the camera pans ben back to the dresser
i cant tell you how beautifully your wife sings
she is pretty good
too bad it was interrupted
ben pauses in dressing speaks almost to himself
converted to pdf by www
ive had the same feeling
louis looks at him briefly
there is a rattle of dishes from the back bedroom
the waiter comes out of the bedroom followed by jo
indicating waiter he said the manager is going to send up somebody to baby sit
the waiter nods politely goes out the door
mckenna permit me the pleasure of serving you a drink
he goes toward the balcony for the drink
were you on the american stage mrs
jo turns and gives ben a meaningful glance
the frenchman is asking questions again
ben gives her a look of comic disparagement
louis comes up hands her a martini
lets sit where its cool
the camera precedes jo and louis as they walk to the balcony
ben putting the finishing touches on his tie watches them out of the corner of his eye
converted to pdf by www
jo takes a seat and louis leans against the railing
yes i was on the american stage and the london stage and even the paris stage
i thought you might have seen me in paris being french and the theater requires time and for me time is often a luxury
have you ever been to paris mr
studies her briefly i was born there
jo takes a sip of her drink with some frustration
what do you do for a living
buy and sell
whatever gives the best profit
she puts down her drink with some exasperation
as she does she glances back toward ben
hes getting his coat but pauses to give her a slight smile and a look that says youre wasting your time
more firmly just what are you buying or selling now in marrakesh
sips his drink you know i would much rather talk about the stage
if you tell me what to answer any
before he can answer there is a knock at the door and he looks toward it
she gets to her feet and starts for the door
converted to pdf by www
ill answer it
the camera pans jo past ben to the door
he has just put on his coat and turns to follow her to the door
she opens it and standing in the corridor is a silhouetted figure
we cannot see the face
jo switches on a light which reveals a rather studious looking man of medium height standing there
excusez moi mais is cherche la chambre do monsieur montgomery
jo looks at ben helplessly who looks over his shoulder toward louis bernard for help in translating the french
as the mckennas turn the man in the doorway lifts himself on tiptoe a little and gives a sharp look in the direction of louis bernard
the man immediately turns his attention back to ben and begins talking in broken english
i am inquiring for the room of a monsieur montgomery
he asked me for a drink and l sorry theres no montgomery here
then pardon me monsieur i regret disturbing you
its all right
as ben closes the door we see that louis bernard has been advancing into the room for a better look at the man in the doorway the mckennas turn back
to the room
louis bernards face his changed slightly to the more serious
hanks voice is heard off converted to pdf by www
mummy i cant cut this meat
ill do it hank
she goes out of the room glancing briefly at louis
to ben may i use your telephone
ben gestures that the phone is his
the camera pans louis to the phone which he picks up and begins talking in french asking first for the operator and a certain number
beyond that his conversation is a mystery because his face reveals nothing
possibly speaks arabic
as louis bernard talks on the phone ben goes to pick up his drink
he comes back into the room as jo enters once again from the bedroom
she looks at louis then at ben who shrugs his shoulders
louis finishes his phone conversation hangs up
i am terribly sorry but i cannot go to dinner with you tonight
i had neglected an important matter which now requires my attention
perhaps another night
he bows briefly and moves towards the door
the mckennas look at each other quite bewildered
the camera is slowly moving around the interior of an arab restaurant catering to european tourists
it has a moorish atmosphere and the diners are sitting on cushions or low sofas
long robed waiters are padding in and out from the kitchens quietly and efficiently serving food
there are no arab women to be seen
the air has a smoky quality and the room is filled with the murmur of voices and the clink of dishes
perhaps soft music of an oriental nature is heard in the background
the light is supplied principally from candles
as the camera completes its sweep around and comes to rest on the entrance we see ben and jo arriving
converted to pdf by www
a headwaiter wearing a fez comes forward
the headwaiter bows slightly
bonsoir madame monsieur
my name is mckenna
the hotel phoned
follow me please
the headwaiter turns and moves into the restaurant the mckennas follow him the camera panning them
ben is interested in everything he sees
jo glances at the diners and then a look of surprise starts through her face
they are passing a couple who are seated on cushions eating
the couple look up at ben and jo
they are the same two people we saw come out of the hotel mamounia just as the mckennas entered
the woman had stared at jo and she does it again nudging the man next to her with an elbow
the mckennas almost pass them then stop
the woman continues half looking over her shoulder again then turns back to her dinner
the headwaiter shows them to their seats two cushions directly behind those of the two people who stared at them
i think you will find this comfortable
he bows and departs
jo seems disturbed looks around as if trying to find another seat
sit down jo please
people are staring at us
she sits on the far cushion
her movements are graceful and easy as she sits tailor fashion
ben being tall and somewhat awkward has trouble
converted to pdf by www
first he kneels and then with much struggle manages to fold his long legs underneath him
he turns to jo expecting to find her amused at his antics but instead her face is serious and she has a secret look about her
she leans close to him
people are staring at us
she gives a quiet warning nod toward the two people sitting behind them
ben cranes his head around but all he can see is the back of a womans head
he turns back
they stared at us when we went into the hotel
jo will you stop imagining things
ben looks at her then slowly turns his head to look behind him at the couple
as he does the woman behind him also turns
they are staring directly at each other
hearing her voice jo turns looks and so does the man with mrs
the woman then turns half way around toward jo
you must think me awfully rude
ive been staring at you ever since i saw you at the hotel
jo slides a glance of see at ben
she peers at jo you are jo conway the jo conway
jo visibly relaxes and becomes jo conway

what ben means is that there are no broadway musical shows produced in indianapolis indiana
of course if we lived in new york
for bens benefit where i hear doctors arent starving
to jo i have nothing against working in new york
nothing except the fact that its very hard for my patients to come all the way from indianapolis for treatment
drayton looks at his wife disapprovingly
oh dear oh dear
im always saying the wrong thing
not the least mrs
tell me dr
mckenna do you always
do you think we could get straightened around
we now find the draytons and the mckennas are sitting in a group eating dinner together
there is no back to back awkwardness
all are busily tearing whole roast chickens apart with their bare fingers
drayton holds a piece of chicken aloft demonstrating the proper arab method of eating
only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand
never use the smaller fingers
and always keep the left hand in the lap
does it have something to do with religion
more social than religious id say

it seems to me if you have four good fingers and a thumb you should use them all
three finger four fingers for my money this is nothing but chicken in the rough
we have it at every drive in back home
well as i was saying i was quite happy farming my bit of land it buckinghamshire when these chaps from the united nations started worrying me
edward was a big noise at the ministry of food during the war you know

jo is staring at the entrance to the restaurant
drayton follows her glance
the two men stop talking and eating and also look
louis bernard is standing in the entrance of the restaurant
on his arm is a rather elegantly dressed woman
she is also handsome and graceful
as he stands waiting for the headwaiter louis bernard looks around the restaurant
his eyes stop when he comes to the mckennas
he looks directly at them without the slightest sign of recognition
trouvez nous un coin tranquille cest possible
could you show me a quiet place
certainly sir converted to pdf by www
jo and ben stare back
there is resentment in jos eyes and conjecture in bens
the headwaiter comes up to louis bernard exchanges a few words with him which we cannot hear and then leads the couple to a set of cushions in the far
corner of the room
as he moves away from the entrance louis bernard does not look at the mckennas
as the couple traverses the restaurant our four diners watch them the draytons out of idle curiosity but the mckennas with growing astonishment as they realize that bernard has no
intention of recognizing them or speaking to them
jo turns back to ben
well just what do you think of that
first he promises to take us to dinner look we only met him today
we cant expect him to change his whole life oh ben
whats the matter with you

she pushes him down again
our dinners getting cold
to the draytons wed love to go with you
ben glares in bernards direction and then picks up a chicken leg
i dont know why ben gets so worked up over unimportant things
ben looks a her slowly and with some amazement
then his eyes lift a little and he sees the headwaiter standing nearby gesturing to him to please use only three fingers
ben looks down at the chicken leg
he is holding it gripped in his fist
this is too much
he throws the leg down to his plate in disgust

over in the far corner of the restaurant the lady with louis bernard leans forward and murmurs something in french
her gaze is across the room in the direction of the mckennas
cest les deux que cherchez

louis turns slightly and looks
he glances back at her and nods significantly
it is around eleven oclock in the morning in the main market square at marrakesh
this is usually the busy time of the day
there are coaches arriving from the countryside with the arab farmers alighting with their baggage veiled women getting off the coaches and going into the markets

the camera panning through the market place to a line of veiled women all working at singer sewing machines
drayton saunters behind them in the distance
jo holds out her hand for ben to shake it
all right darling a deals a deal
ben takes her hand
for every time step hell learn a new muscle and for every chorus three bones
ben cant help chuckling
and for every matinee
two chapters of greys anatomy
they stop short of bumping into hank and mrs
he points sewing machines
looks like a television commercial
now if we could only get four cases of the seven year itch we could retire
or if mrs
yarros really has triplets we could at least redecorate the house
laughs oh ben what would they say if they heard us
the camera panning through the market place to a line of veiled women all working at singer sewing machines
drayton saunters behind them in the distance
one of the reasons i came to a place like marrakesh is so that we could say things like this without anybody hearing us
converted to pdf by www
id like to say something where nobody can hear us
this is the safest place
when are we going to have another child
ben looks at her with some surprise
youre the doctor
you have all the answers
yeah but but this is the first time ive heard the question
they stop short of bumping into hank and mrs
he points sewing machines
looks like a television commercial
jo laughs appreciatively and rumples his hair
having a good time hank
hes delighted with everything
at this moment mr
drayton saunters up and for the first time the group is all together
suddenly there as some shouts in the distance
everyones attention is drawn to the noise
hank moves quickly threading his way through some people for a better look the camera panning him away
from hanks viewpoint we see police chasing a white robed arab figure
the police consist of a couple of uniformed french officials and two or three others in local arab dress with rifles slung over their backs
hank fascinated at the drama dishes away to got a better view
jo and ben miss hank
then see him moving through the crowd
converted to pdf by www
hank come back here
she starts forward after him but mrs
drayton moves faster than anyone
she passes both of the mckennas and overtakes hank
drayton reaches down and takes hold of hanks shoulders and pulls him toward her
hank its best to keep away from trouble
hank is looking away toward the chase
whats going on
drayton looks toward the trouble
it looks as though the police are chasing somebody
a closer view of the chase brings us back to where the motor coaches are loading up and for a moment the police as lost to view
a high view of the open air tannery with its circles of crude stone water tanks becomes the scene of a further part of the chase
we see the white robed arab leaping between the crude tanks with the police yelling and running after him in the distance
the difficulty of the obstacles enables the arab to get ahead of them and we see that he is now able to dodge through an archway into the grain market
as the chase passes through the grain market it scatters grain and grain sellers in every direction
converted to pdf by www
the pursued arab dashes through an enclosure holding the donkeys which are used to carry grain to and from the market
there is quite a stampede with the donkeys running kicking and braying in fright
through another archway the arab now dashes down some of the narrow streets of the medina
sapling branches are laced overhead creating a latticed shadow pattern on the ground below
as the arab moves along the narrow street with the police in pursuit progress is made difficult by the many shoppers and bicycle riders
one bicycle rider trying to avoid the oncoming arab turns and drives helplessly into a lags pottery store
the sound of wreckage is enormous
the arab turns into another street where the rows of brilliantly dyed wool yarn hang from overhead strung along sapling poles
there is in unfortunate collision between the fleeing arab end a workman crossing the street with a large vat of blue dye on his shoulder
in a moment the whole narrow streetway is saturated with blue dye and everyone is lifting his robe and hopping around to avoid being stained
the arab continues on past
the police dash through the street trying to avoid the dye themselves
the police reach a narrow intersection where the blind beggars as squatting begging alms
there is no sign of their quarry
then one of them points to faint blue footprints dashing away to the left
they take up the pursuit once again
a high overhead shot of the narrow streets showing that the police have caught sight of their man again
but there seems to be something strange about the chase now
two white robed arabs are running
the second arab we havent seen before but he is faster than the first man and is gaining on him
converted to pdf by www
a closer level shot the camera panning shows the two breathless men closing in on each other
as they reach an intersection in the streets lighted by a shaft of sunlight the new arab comes up behind the original man being chased and whipping out a knife
from under his robes plunges it into the back of the first man
then he turns and quickly moves away into a street on his left
the first arab jerks his head up and backward with the sharp pain of the stabbing then he staggers into the dark shadows
a high shot shows that the stabbed man is almost out of sight for a moment so that the police continue their chase after the second man who has swiftly
darted down another side turning
the camera moves in behind the stabbed arab
the knife is still in his back
we get a glimpse of his hands vainly groping behind him
the camera moves with him as he staggers out into the open market place
his shadow on the ground shows us the silhouette of the knife handle sticking out from his back
the camera moves in close to follow the agony of his head and shoulders as he attempts to go forward
the camera seems to pass beyond him for a moment and there a few yards away stands ben mckenna and his group
the arab hesitates for a moment but the attitude of his head shows us that he has seen mckenna
he makes his way desperately and painfully toward him
he is finding it difficult to remain upright and even take those last few steps
a closer view of mckenna shows that those around him including his wife and the draytons become frightened
he spreads his arms out to move them back protectively waiting to see what is going to happen
converted to pdf by www
as the arab reaches mckenna the knife drops from his back and he collapses at bens feet
ben endeavors to grab him as he falls
he misses his shoulders and his hands close in and inadvertently grab the arabs cheeks
a big close up of bens hands as his fingers slide off the arabs face
he turns his hands up and we see they are covered with black grease paint
the arabs head his now dropped to the ground and we see streaks of white flesh showing through the dark makeup which bens fingers had scraped off
ben drops to his knees to examine the man better
the arab gasps out something in french
ils ont trouves
ils ont reussi a trouver
ben looks at him puzzled
ben is quite surprised
ben glances swiftly at the fallen knife and then reaches across louis bernard to turn him over and examine his wound
but the frenchman reaches up with one arm and grabs ben by the coat
mckenna listen to me first
with what strength he has louis drags ben down until bens ear is near to his mouth
with a great effort louis whispers to him
converted to pdf by www
a big closeup of bens ear and louis mouth enables us to hear the whispering but louis voice is fading so much that we cannot distinguish the words at least
enough to make any sense out of what he says
is to be killed
to try ambrose chappell
presently the mouth stops speaking
it remains still and open
as ben backs away we see the staring eyes and open mouth of louis
ben quickly puts his hand inside the robes to feel for louis heart the hand slowly withdraws
the arabs crowd in to see the details
louis bernard the mckennas and the draytons are in the center of a large flat cement section of the market place
the police by now have caught up to the event and dash quickly into the picture toward ben and louis
instinctively ben backs away as do the draytons and jo and hank
however ben still stays closer than the rest
one of the police picks up the knife and examines it another bends down to wipe the make up off louis bernards face
ben looks around for his wife
ben beckons to his wife beyond him to join him
jo turns hank over to mrs
hank stands close to the english woman as jo comes over
as jo comes up to ben he is feeling in his pocket for something
takes out a pen
ben who is he
got something to write on
she begins looking in her purse
is he dead
converted to pdf by www
she produces a small address book
ben snatches it out of her hand unceremoniously
he opens the book end begins writing something down fast
jo watches him with mystified curiosity
drayton strolls up out of curiosity
he has also seen bens hurried writing but ben casually puts the notebook back into his inside pocket along with the pen
before either man can comment on the writing the voice of a policeman is heard speaking in french
savez vous qui est cet homme
the uniformed french policeman approaches ben
the policeman repeats his question as he stops in front of ben
jai dit savez vous qui est cet homme
drayton steps forward to help
he addresses the police
il ne parle pas francais
the policeman nods
drayton turns to ben
he wants to find out if you know this man
the policeman watches their faces
of course we know him
she points its the frenchman louis bernard
her gestures and her comments although in english give the policeman all the information he needs
looks at body louis bernard
he moves away toward the body which the other policemen are now covering with a sheet
converted to pdf by www
he gives them some instructions in french
ben looks at jo in a way that says who asked you to say anything
the french policeman returns to the group
he addresses drayton
quel est le nom de ces personnes
dites leur que jaimerai quils viennent tous les deux au commissariat pour faire un rapport
drayton nods unhappily and turns to ben and jo
just as i thought
he wants both of you to go to police headquarters to make a statement
do we have to
im afraid so
he turns to wife our friends here have to go to the police station
im going with them to give what help i can
drayton comes up to the group still holding on to hanks hand

police two moves across the square with drayton
ben and jo precede them
drayton begins conversing in french with them about the crime but we cannot distinguish their words clearly
jo looks back and gives a little wave to hank
the mckennas are walking across the square with the police and drayton a few yards behind them
the camera moves with them
jo moves close to ben and speaks to him in a surreptitious manner
why should he suddenly turn up in arab outfit wearing makeup
whats more important why was he killed
ill bet he was a spy or something like that
ben looks at her with some surprise
ben what did he whisper to you
what did you write down
ill tell you later
ben looks at his hands
what is it
i dont feel very good after what i said about louis bernard last night

jo looks away equally embarrassed
ben wipes his fingers with his handkerchief
the main hallway and waiting room of the police station in marrakesh
french and arab personnel move up and down the wide hallway from one doorway to another
there is a babble of voices and the sound of phones heard off
the mckennas and drayton are seated on a long bench waiting to be called into the inner office of the police inspector
drayton sits next to ben
it is hot
jo has eyes for everything but ben seems to be somewhat impatient
he looks at his watch for the third or fourth time in a minute
drayton notices him studying his watch
he leans to him and at the same time wipes off the side of his on face with a handkerchief
once we talk to the police inspector ill do my best to out some of the red tape
i have to stretch
she gets up and saunters away looking around the police station for whatever there is to see
drayton speaks to ben with reassuring geniality
im afraid the questions will go on till doomsday if you admit knew this chap bernard before
i didnt know him at all
we only met yesterday on a bus
theyre a cynical lot these french they might refuse to believe that
theyll have to believe me
it might sound a bit odd from their point of view
they saw the poor chap whispering to you
and then they saw you writing something down
converted to pdf by www
ben looks at drayton waiting for his to go on
the question is are you going to show them what you wrote down
before ben can say any more a policeman opens the door leading to the police inspectors office
he calls out
jo turns around at the sound of the door opening and ben and drayton start to rise from the bench
the policeman steps aside holding the door as a police inspector comes out of the office from behind him
he is a short heavy built dark man
he does not smile
the inspector walks a few steps into the corridor stops
ben jo and drayton approach him
drayton speaks first
ces personnes sont mes bons amis les mckenna
mon nom est drayton
ils ne parlent pas francais et ils mont demande de traduire
the inspector answers in english
thank you monsieur drayton but a translator will not be necessary
to mckenna wont you come inside monsieur madame
he stops aside and wait
to drayton do to the kindness to wait
i might have questions for you later
he motions to the mckennas
jo goes past him first into the office followed by ben drayton returns to the bench and watches the trio as the office door closes on them

ben and jo sit down
the inspector looks at some papers on his desk then holds out his hand
precisely your passports please
ben looks at jo who fishes for them in her purse
she takes them out hands them to ben who hands them to the inspector
he scrutinizes them
uncomfortable ben retreats to a chair and sits down waiting
the inspector checks the pictures against the people he sees sitting in his office then puts the passports down on his desk

you are a doctor monsieur
a tourist and an american citizen
three good reasons why you should have nothing in common with louis bernard
i didnt have

a medical convention
you come to marrakesh with him in the same bus
you drank an aperitif with him in your hotel room
and you ate at the same restaurant last night
but at different tables
the inspectors eyes study her briefly as if her comment was an unnecessary interruption
then his eyes return to ben
converted to pdf by www
so louis bernard is a stranger to you
i met him yesterday on the bus for the first time in my life
the inspector begins to let his skepticism be seen
ironically and yet out of five thousand people in a great market place he comes to you when he is about to die
is that the action of a casual acquaintance monsieur
obstinate i know nothing about louis bernard
not even i suppose that he was an agent of the deuxieme bureau

the door opens suddenly
the two men look up
a policeman opens the door and leans in
on demande monsieur mckenna au telephone
as he speaks the policeman nods in the direction of ben
the inspector impatiently tries to dismiss the officer with a gesture
laissez nous nous sommes occuppes
ben motions to the policeman to stay where he is wait a minute

he goes out the door closing it behind him
the inspector sits down heavily
then he looks up at jo
i dont know a thing the camera pans ban as he follows the policeman down the outside corridor past drayton who is still sitting on a bench and watching ben
somewhat anxiously and into a small plain office
the policeman enters the small office first
there is a desk more like a table and a phone is lying on it off the hook
the policeman picks it up and hands it to ben
ben holds it without speaking a second and waves the policeman out
the policeman is indifferent
ben puts the phone to his ear
a robed arab is sitting in a chair holding a telephone
the room is part of a rather elaborate moorish house
the arab speaks in accented english

as ben answers he idly looks through the open doorway toward drayton sitting on the bench outside
this is mckenna
whos calling me
the arab doesnt bother to identify himself
you tell even one word of that louis bernard whispered to you in the market place your little boy will be in serious danger
the arab starts to hang up
there is an audible click in the receiver held in bens hand
there is no answer
ben lowers the phone slightly looks at it a minute then continues on downward with it returning the receiver to the phone cradle
he stands a brief moment in thought then half turns toward drayton sitting in the corridor outside
he motions to drayton to join him in the office drayton
the englishman gets up and comes into the small office
didnt your wife say she was taking hank straight back to the hotel
as i recall
ben picks up the phone hands it to drayton

he goes one way ben the other

as ben enters the office both jo and the inspector look up him inquiringly
who was it ben
ben adopts as casual an air as he can under the circumstances
he doesnt sit down
he speaks more to the inspector than to his wife avoiding her eyes
it was the concierge at the hotel
he heard we were being held by the police and thought there was some way he could help us
that was nice of him
looking at inspector i told him if we werent back there in fifteen minutes to call the american consulate in casablanca
the inspector has realised that he wont get any more out of ben
charmingly but monsieur if you had only told me in the first place that you wished to consult with your consul
ben gives him a look
lets go jo
there is just one small formality
i must request you to sign a statement of the facts

but a moment

jo looks at her husband somewhat puzzled

she holds out her hand more firmly

reluctantly ben takes out the notebook hands it to her
ben watches her as she reads the note he has written
the notebook page held by jo on which ben has scribbled louis bernards message
it reads a man
a jo looks up soberly
why didnt you give this to the police
because i didnt want to
but ben a mans life interrupts is at stake i know but im not sure of whats the right thing to do

what a shook it must be to his mind

ben is uncomfortable and unhappy but he tries to hide it
he leans toward jo as if hes about to tell her something important
he reaches out places his hand over hers
he trails off what about him
hes the kind of a kid who can take of himself
the victoria turns into the hotel mamounia and pulls up in front of the entrance
the mckennas dismount

he hands her the water she drinks some of it
all right doctor mckenna

it was no accident that louis bernard helped us out on the bus and struck up a conversation
you were right about him
yes you were right about him
jo is beginning to appear a little drowsy
ben watches her closely
i know all that
get to the surprise
he got talking to us because he was on the lookout for a suspicious married couple

that phone call i received at the police station
she nods dumbly
it wasnt from the concierge at the hotel
it was from somebody with a foreign voice who said if i told anybody one word of what
louis bernard whispered to me in the market place that something
something might happen to
to to hank
she comes suddenly as awake as she can
theyve taken him away
she pushes herself to her feet
she is fighting the drug successfully
she almost shouts at him
drayton took hank back to the hotel
she is downstairs

drayton has vanished

she struggles fiercely trying to get away to hit him kick him
let go of me
ill never never never forget this

he struggles silently with her trying to push her down on the bed and hold her until the drug does its work
you think youre the only one strong enough to take anything
ben ben i hate you with my whole heart
she starts to cry hank
where is hank
hank oh hank

you damn miserable human
how could anybody
he has forced her down on the bed pinioning her arms even though her legs still struggle somewhat

her arm relax somewhat
she is still straining to move her head and talk but all that comes out are unintelligible sounds and a half moan of anguish
then shes gone
ben looks at her a moment relaxes his grip
he lowers his head down against hers
he seem to be fighting the desire to cry
he finally gains control of himself
he lifts his head slightly gives her a soft and heartfelt kiss on the cheek
softly darling if somebody did this to me id say just what you said
ben stands up
the weight of unhappiness is heavy on him
he gets a blanket from the foot of the bed and covers her up
he brushes back the hair from her forehead
then he turns and the camera panning him over to the door
he takes one last look at jo then goes out the door closing it softly behind him
as the light of sunset fades into growing darkness the muezzin stands atop the minaret arms raised to the heavens and giving out his high sing song call to prayer
the call is taken up by another voice somewhere in the city and then another and still another until the prayer is a continuous round of chanting starting close moving
away almost fading and then returning
the chant of the call to prayer can be heard in the background
we are in the single bedroom of hank mckenna
there is one lamp burning over the empty bed and another on the wall over the dresser
ben is despondently carrying hanks small suits and other articles of clothing from the closet to in open suitcase on the bed
as he crosses with the final armload of clothes he looks out of the door into the large bedroom
in the mirror on the far wall ben can see the reflection of his wife stirring in her bed
he watches as she drags herself up into a half pitting position

jos eyes are beginning to open and close and she shakes her head a little as she tries to recover from the sedative he gave her
ben puts down hanks suitcase and crosses to their own luggage the camera panning him in such a way as to keep jo in the background
he opens the suitcases and begins taking clothes out of the dresser drawers to pack them
jo opens her eyes and looks about her
she tries to straighten up her hair a little
she takes in the room and then as though a sudden thought strikes her she looks toward the open door of her missing sons bedroom
the empty boys room as seen from her viewpoint
ben pauses in his packing a moment to observe her
the he continues on with his work
jo stares at the empty room for a moment longer then turns sharply back toward her husband
from her viewpoint we see the back view of ben is he continues packing
ben half glances over his shoulder now aware that she is fully awake
converted to pdf by www
theres still no news of him jo
she stares at him apathetically
we now see bens face as he packs his suitcases
beyond him past his shoulder we see his wife staring in his direction
he continues to talk although he finds it difficult to be matter of fact moving back and forth from the dresser drawers to the suitcases
both the draytons are definitely gone
the hotel register says they come from london
drayton told the concierge he was a college professor
the only thing to do now is to get out of marrakesh
her face shows a slight rise in reaction mostly puzzlement
as individuals were helpless here
and because of that phone call we cant bring the police in on it
i even thought of taking that chance
he pauses and glances at her to see how she reacts
she just stares at his her eyes a little dull
but connect hanks disappearance to louis bernards murder
and the first thing theyd do would be to make me tell them louis bernards message
that could be hanks
well it wouldnt help him
ben goes to take some of jos clothes out of drawer and comes up with a play script
he looks at it a moment then back to jo
her eyes observe it but she says nothing
ben continues on to the suitcase where he lays the script in with the clothes
were going to london
she looks a little more sharply as if in question
he notices as he goes to the dresser for more clothes
converted to pdf by www
i found out
the draytons had a private plane thats how they took hank back
it could lend anywhere no question of a passport or anything
he packs some more clothes away
jo doesnt stir she just stares at him
so were going to london to find him
he looks at her for a reaction
she turns her head away from him as if in disagreement or perhaps fighting for control of her emotions
ben crosses to her the camera panning him
he sits down on the edge of the bed and takes out the small notebook from his coat
he opens it
in careful low tones he reads louis bernards message
reading a man
is to be killed
to try ambrose chappell
looks up were going to try this ambrose chappell and if he has anything at all to do with this im going to offer him every cent ive got to
got hank back
this ambrose chappell guy is our only hope
jo puts out a weary hand as though to dismiss the piece of paper and all that it contains
again she turns her head away
slowly ben puts the paper back into pocket
he speaks with a shade more urgency in his voice
weve only got a few hours jo
we have to got up and start moving
ben gets up and the camera pans him to the dresser and the suitcases
then he pauses and looks back at jo who is still looking away
jo turns back to look at ben
she is studying him now as if she has just seen him for the first time
her eyes are more alert
ben turns back to his packing
ive paid the bill and theres a car waiting downstairs
as soon as i pack were leaving
slowly jo gets off the bed and comes over to ben
he pauses articles of clothing in his hands

for a moment she stands there looking at him and then impulsively she throws her arms around him and clings to him
her anguish is genuine
oh ben ben ben
where is he
where is he
ben kisses her on the cheek
she buries her head in his shoulder
ben stares off into space as if he hopes to find in answer to her question
fade in camera panning with b
viscount as it taxiis in to position
the first passengers emerge from the doorway of the plane followed by ben and jo
there is a group of newspaper men and press photographers gathered around the gangway
there is a stir in the group as the mckennas appear
a couple of flash bulbs pop
an airlines official hurries up the gangway to ben
would you mind waiting for the press photographers
they nod agreement and the official joins the passengers as they go down the steps
jo turns to ben
how could they remember me so well ben
its been four years since i played london
i guess youre the kind of girl they dont forget
but how did they know
who could have told them
ben you didnt
converted to pdf by www
she breaks off
all i did was wire val and helen parnell to get us rooms he indicates fans and newspapermen
but i didnt count on this jo understands that his kind intention has slightly miscarried
they look off as the yelling of the bobby sox fans becomes louder
fans behind the airport fence holding out autograph books and shouting for her autograph
others try to break from the barrier but are restrained by the police
standing in the front row of the fans is a sober faced woman who is not shouting or holding out a book
as the last of the passengers leaves the plane jo and ben take a position on the steps for the photographers
despite the long trip her worry her fatigue jo does her best to act the part her public demands
she smiles as well as she can waves a little turns her head to the right and to the left to favor the photographers
the sober faced woman standing among the fans
she has a rather grey pasty face and stares off at jo through horn rimmed glasses that are encrusted with dust in the corners of the lenses
after a moment she pushes her way back through the crowd of fans and moves out of sight
as the photographers continue their work ben and jo come down the remaining steps and are joined by a man wearing ordinary civilian clothes
he takes a small black identification folder out of his pocket and holds it up for their inspection
im inspector edington of the criminal investigation department of scotland yard
converted to pdf by www
there is immediate alarm in jos face but she then controls it
what is it
as things are theres no need for you to go through the customs
will you come this way
his tone and manner of asking them leaves little doubt that his question is an order
the mckennas glance at each other briefly
they realize that this is a further development of their involvement
whatever you say
smiles this way please
he and the airlines official lead the mckennas toward another entrance to the airport building
as she follows jo seems tense and a little scared
the be spectacled pasty faced woman who had been standing with the fans before is now speaking rather cautiously into a telephone
we dont hear what she is saying but the inclination of her head shows that she is making some reference to the new arrivals
another man is waiting for them at a door outside the airport building
this is mr
woburn doctor and mrs
how do you do
now what do you people want with us
buchanan would like to have a chat with you inside
who is mr

woburn leads ben and jo into an inner office
it is a good sized room plain but comfortable
this is mr
buchanan doctor and mrs
how do you do
ben nods to him without speaking
thank you woburn
woburn quietly exits closing the door behind him
the mckennas stand a moment wondering what do
do sit down wont you
jo hesitates then sits down
why does scotland yard want to talk with us
buchanan sits down behind the desk
hes sophisticated and intelligent
let me say at once were shocked
that you son was taken from you in marrakesh and deeply sympathetic
jo leans forward quickly eager hopeful unable to restrain herself
do you know where he is
ben is somewhat more reserved
what about hank
what have you heard
converted to pdf by www
i only wish i could give you some cheerful news
jo settles back unhappy discouraged and a little resentful of buchanan
ben seems irritated by the disappointment
buchanan continues quietly
we might find him
quite soon indeed if we work together
louis bernard was sent to marrakesh by the french at our request to check up on an assassination plot here in london
a good agent keeps on staking his life
he doesnt always win
ben and jo watch buchanan carefully
bernard reckoned you were a man to trust
he relied on you to come to us
jo looks at ben
he thinks a moment but says nothing
those people kidnapped your boy in order to keep your mouth shut
thats right isnt it
i think they took him for money
then why didnt you go straight to your consulate in casablanca
why did you come to london
ben is silent
he cant think of an answer to this one
jo seems about to volunteer some information
buchanan converted to pdf by www
ben looks sharply at her
buchanan seem only casually obvious of the exchange
but he has noted it in his mind
youre convinced that these people brought your son to london
youre convinced you can find him off your own bat
but with the help we can give you theres a chance
a really good chance
before ben can stop her jo bursts in hotly
they told us not to say anything
buchanan turns to her and speaks gently but with force
anything you tell me will be in the most absolute confidence
ben starts to interrupt
that might be true but buchanan holds up a hand to interrupt him
to jo your son is the trump card these people hold
hes perfectly safe for the moment
and when theyve done what theyre going to do theyll let him go
so all we have to do is wait
converted to pdf by www
gently to jo no mrs
if they consider the boy a nuisance afterwards im afraid he gestures
now dont try to frighten us mr
its exactly what im trying to do frighten you
im trying to prevent a man being murdered here in london
the pressure on jo is beginning to weaken her
if you dont tell me all you know you become an accessory before the fact of murder
in english law you become just short of murderers yourselves
jo a creature of emotion is bewildered and upset and tired of fighting buchanan
she is ready to give in
she looks to ben
ben what can we do by ourselves
we need interrupts you worked on the wrong mckenna mr
louis bernard talked to me not my wife
buchanan turns to ben
then you tell me
bernard spoke in french and i dont understand a word of the language
there is a pause while buchanan studies ben
and what did you write down on a piece of paper
converted to pdf by www
ben stands there
he has no answer
jo gets up from her seat
ben maybe they could find those people and hank before interrupts maybe
maybe isnt good enough for me and it shouldnt be good enough for you
you act as if youre the only one whos concerned about hank
now jo i didnt mean it that way
we made up our minds what we were going to do now lets try to stick to it
ben turns to buchanan
wed like to cooperate with you mr
buchanan but but we just cant
quietly i have a son of my own
i dont know what id do
jo looks at ben appealingly
even ben is uncertain now trying to evaluate things quickly well maybe if we he is interrupted by a tapping at the door
buchanan looks up as do the mckennas
the camera pans buchanan to the door as he opens it himself
his assistant woburn is there
there is a whispered conversation
woburn retreats and buchanan turns back to the room
matter of factly a phone call for you mrs
buchanan crosses and picks up the telephone from the desk
put the call through here please
he pauses a moment then hands the phone to jo

jo steps forward takes the phone hesitantly looking at bon for reassurance
he nods to her
buchanan meanwhile has casually but quickly gone out of the office closing the door behind him
in the outer office woburn quickly hands buchanan the phone who puts it to his ear
jo puts the phone to her ear
she speaks hesitantly
we hear a voice on filter
this is mrs
you remember me
jo pales and seems about to faint
ben reacts with surprise and gives a stop or two forward
he is tense
jo recovers herself

buchanan puts out a hand
woburn places a pen in it and slides a pad along the desk under it
we hear mrs
draytons voice over the filter

jo shows some relief but shes still deeply concerned
where is he

i expect youd like to speak to him wouldnt you
she looks towards ben
ben moves close to her trying to pick up a little of the conversation from the phone
she tips the phone a little in his direction
just a minute
mummy is that you
jo fights sudden tears
oh hank hank darling are you really all right
im a little scared mummy
but im all right i guess

desperation hank where are you

welbeck eight there is a sudden click
ben rattles the receiver
all he gets is a dial tone
he hangs up and turns to jo who is quietly crying trying to get over the shock of hearing hank
buchanan enters the office as ben takes jo by the shoulders and turns her around to him
he takes out a handkerchief hands it to her
she covers her face for a moment then dries her tears
she looks up at ben
he was scared
she starts sobbing soundlessly again her body shaking
ben takes her in his arms to quiet her
she quiets down slowly
buchanan standing behind the desk doesnt look at the pair but he speaks first
it was a london telephone exchange
woburn comes in the office goes to buchanan
tersely public call box west one
he shrugs as if to say thats the end
buchanan nods for woburn to leave
woburn does casting a side glance of sympathy toward jo and ben
he closes the door quietly behind him
buchanan looks at the pair and sighs in a manner that suggests he recognizes defeat when he sees it
jo now has herself under control
she leaves bens arms and returns to her seat to gather herself together dry her eyes
ben turns to buchanan

do i have to say any more
he reaches for a pad and pencil
he scribbles something on it
you may change your minds

he tears off a page of the paper and hands it to ben
in a suite at savoys hotel we see the door open and ben and jo mckenna are ushered into the suite by the frock coated desk clerk
behind them are two assistant porters carrying their bags
in the foreground through which we are shooting are three large baskets of assorted flowers
they are obviously gift of greeting to london
the porters move off into the bedroom with the bags
they lay out the bags open the drapes and windows etc
the desk clerk turns on the lights in the main room as the mckennas look about
everything all right sir
hands ben key your room key sir
ben takes it
the porters come out of the bedroom
ben reaches in his pocket comes up with a bill hands it to one of them
the porter touches his forehead in sort of a salute
the porters exit
the desk clerk follows pauses at the door
and i hope you have a most pleasant stay in london
both jo and ben turn to look at him briefly
he is smiling they are not
the desk clerk goes out the door carefully closing it
the mckenna are alone
jo turns to look at the basket of flowers and crosses toward the camera to look at them
she takes a card in her hand attached to the largest basket reads the note

to ben its from the panells
welcome home jo
look forward to seeing your family
especially the little she breaks off jo stands there a brief moment takes a breath and looks at to otter two cards
cindy and jan
to ben you dont know cindy and jan
ben puts the room key down on a table and the camera pans him over to a smaller desk containing the telephone and telephone books
he sits down at the desk and reaches for the general telephone directory
he begins flipping through the pages
jo turns from the flowers and walks over to him
he pauses takes out of his pocket the black notebook on which he wrote louis bernards message
he tears out the page hands the notebook to jo
youd better keep your book
he returns to the telephone book after looking at the note and placing it on the desk in front of him
what are you looking for
the only clue we have which might lead us to hank
the place and identity of mr
he finds what is apparently the right page
his finger begins to trace down the list of names
bens finger going down the column of names

he lifts the receiver but jo reaches out to stop him
he looks at her with some annoyance
dont you want me to call him
i cant make up my mind ben
im jut scared to death
im afraid well do the wrong thing
quietly ill try not to be too wrong
he picks up the phone
what are you going to say
ill offer to keep my mouth shut and give him all the money we have for hank
to phone operator
consults address gulliver
he waits and at that moment there is a sudden loud but happy pounding on the door
both jo and ben jump and turn toward the door almost frightened
muffled shouts are heard of open up
we know youre in there
she heads for the door and ben sits there squirming with suspense and annoyance at being interrupted
beyond him jo opens the door and immediately four people pour in
they are val parnall and his wife
helen intelligent sophisticated and full of life

the other two are cindy fontaine an american music hall entertainer now in england around forty five more of a character actress than a lead and jan peterson a musical
comedy singer nearer jos age smart looking but talkative and slightly scatterbrained
the women come in first helen parnell throws her arms around jo in affectionate greeting
you look wonderful
val parnell follows the women in and closes the door behind him
when we got your wire i couldnt believe it
what were you doing down in morocco
two minutes later helen was on the phone to me
and i had to call jan
youre the perfect answer to what london needs jo
this weeks the dullest thing since my first show
jo has disengaged herself from helen
shakes hands with val
jo and i want to thank all of you for the lovely flowers
but you shouldnt have
we might not be here long
ben has been watching them anxiously torn between hanging up the phone or waiting for his call to go through
the call finally comes through

they notice him for the first time
oh hello mr

toward ben oh i am sorry

especially in such a psychosomatic business
why will you be quiet
you dont know what psychosomatic means
i do too
it means when your mind gets sick of your body it does something to it the doctors trying to talk on the phone
ben tries to be casual and amiable
its only business
helen parnell flops into a chair
business is everything
they all fall silent and watch ben
he is uncomfortable
he tries to keep voice down mr
forced to be louder i said is this ambrose chappell
well this mr
doctor benjamin mckenna
he looks at the listening group uncomfortably
converted to pdf by www
to group i dont think we need to be quiet

val parnell signals silently to her that he can wait until after the call
well uh uh
are you going to be at your address for a while
uh huh its just some business
uh huh well thank you
ill drop around
ben hangs up and turns to the group
he tries to be as casual as possible
he picks up the note from louis bernard and the one on which the address of ambrose chappell is written and shoves them into his pocket
he rises to meet his guests
we could have talked
smiles thats what i told you
to group id like everyone to meet my husband
ben volunteers his hand to val parnell while nodding at mrs
takes his hand ive heard so much about you doctor its nice to see you in person
you look just like those pictures jo had in her dressing room four years ago

all momentary gaiety goes from jos face and ben has a hard time appearing nonchalant
he hes staying with some other people so we can have a little time to ourselves

i hope he has your looks and the doctors brains
jo turns away toward the flowers
thank you again for the beautiful flowers
quickly im taking orders for drinks
he looks around

but dinner tonights on me
jo turns around to look at him disturbed almost to the point of alarm
a carefree dinner is something she just couldnt go through
into phone room service please

smiles at her and i wish i could persuade her to stay a month
oh val i wish i could but
to val will you order the stuff
he starts toward the door pausing to pat jo comfortingly on the shoulder
ill be back in a little while
arent you going to wait for a drink doctor
thank you but ill catch up when i get back
ben starts for the door
she goes with him to the door
ben opens the door and jo follows him half way into the corridor
the voices of the others are half heard over jo and bens sotto voce conversation

maybe hed like to sleep or something
maybe he has ulcers and cant eat

she takes his am it has to be done jo
i want to go with you
jan how somebody so graceful can have such an awkward sense of diplomacy ill never know
i wont disappear
in the background the four visitors while not actually eavesdropping are somewhat subdued by the attitude of the mckennas toward each other
ben for the last time please let me go
he pats her affectionately on the cheek
two people are much easier to follow than one
we dont want buchanans men on our tracks
or the other people either
im going out by the service entrance he turns and goes quickly
she watches him briefly then turns back into the room
she tries to assume a more pleasant face
in a quiet street off camden town we see ben alight and pay off a london taxi
the taxi does a u turn and disappears around a corner
ben starts to walk toward the camera
he glances at the piece of paper from his pocket bearing ambrose chappells address
he is completely alone in a deserted street so much so that his footsteps click on the pavement and create the feeling of an echo
as he walks he listens to the echo ind for a moment wonders if it is an echo
he slows up and comes to a stop close to the camera
there is complete silence only the faint distant london traffic noises
converted to pdf by www
he resumes his walk the camera dollying him
the echo starts again
he slows up again and stops but this time the echo continues
he becomes tense looks around in alarm
the camera pans the streets from bens viewpoint
there is no sign of anyone
ben resumes his walk the camera dollying him
he stops suddenly as though to trap the echo but the echo comes on after him
slightly scared he now resumes his walk with a more hurried pace
the echo gets louder
he glances quickly over his shoulder again
a man is following him at about the same pace
he is rather well dressed and appears nonchalant
ben continues walking and after a bit cautiously glances behind him
the same man is following behind
ben glances down at the paper in his hand and looks up trying to locate the right house number as he walks
the street has a mixture of houses yards an odd dirty looking store or two
bens expression indicates that he would like to make his destination before the man following catches up with him
then he changes his mind
he deliberately slows up
showing ben as he walks slowly along listening to the man approaching behind him listening with the back of his head and with his whole body
the man walking behind is aware of ben
he begins staring at him
converted to pdf by www
ben instinctively clenches his right hand into a fist of preparedness
as the man closes in ben we see that he is rather elderly sixty years old perhaps
as the man reaches ben and passes him bens follows him and study him
ben watches the man go on ahead of him at a faster pace
suddenly the man turns a sharp right into doorway and is gone
ben glances at the paper in his hand
he stops and looks up in astonishment
the little side doorway in which the elderly man turned
above it is an old painted sign reading ambrose ben hesitates briefly in thought puts the piece of paper into his pocket then makes up his mind and goes through
ben rather cautiously makes his way across a small and somewhat dreary looking yard and comes to face a low building at the end of which is a kind of
the door of the factory is just closing as he makes his way across
ben pauses at the door to the factory and looks down at the pushbutton bell
there is a window next to the door
ben bends and peers through the window
staring through the other side of the window is the snarling realistic head of a tiger
startled ben recoils instinctively
then he turns back to the door takes a deep breath braces himself and presses the doorbell
the door is soon opened by a young workman in shirtsleeves and apron
converted to pdf by www
id like to speak to mr
ambrose chappell please
he opens the door and ben enters
ben follows the workman into the shop
it is cluttered with stuffed animals of every size and shape imaginable
lions tigers elephant heads swordfish crocodiles everything
ben stares around at what he sees
a number of workmen are busy mounting stuffing and preparing animals for display
the workmen who let him in calls to someone
a sent to see you sir
a man about eighty years old turns from inspecting a piece of work and comes forward to ben
he is a thin gracious gentle sort of creature
good afternoon sir
i am ambrose chappell
ben studies the man briefly
his face shows disbelief that such a man could be put of an assassination plot
chappell stops in front of him waits a brief moment
what can i do for you
well you see i uh
there is a twinkle in the old mans eye
you gave me your name that might be a start
oh of course mckenna
doctor benjamin mckenna i called you
converted to pdf by www
after a moment oh yes yes
you are ambrose chappell
smiles i have been ambrose chappell for nearby seventy one years
he winks but i think i understand your problem
it happens all the time
you expected someone else just a moment
he turns and calls out ambrose
from behind a doorway on the far side a man emerge s in response to the call
he is somewhat younger than the first ambrose chappell but not by much
he is the fifty year old gentleman who had been apparently following ben on the street
the camera pans him over following to his father and ben
i think this gentleman wants to talk to us
now why dont you go and have a nice rest
i have centuries of rest ahead of me
nods to ben good day to you sir
ben nods in return and the elder chappell returns to whatever he was doing when ben entered
now what can i do for you
ben turns his attention back to the son
he is now a little more in command of himself
converted to pdf by www
im doctor mckenna
he waits no reaction does the name mean anything to you
thinks for a moment
the name obviously doesnt register
i dont think so
a widor angle of the shop
workmen pause in their work to look in the direction of ben with some curiosity
nods his head but waits with a deadpan expression for ben to continue
after a pause ben does
you have no idea why i came here
my dear sir i havent the faintest idea
bens expression shows that he feels chappell is putting up a thorough bluff but he still goes on
i was given your name by someone i happened to meet in marrakesh
s expression doesnt change except for a slightly raised eyebrow
ben now has the feeling hes on to the right man
i suppose youve heard of him
he seems to be turning the name over in his mind
ben turns to at the workmen around them
converted to pdf by www
the workmen half listening return to their work on the various animals
they are a bit self conscious at being observed eavesdropping
ben turns back to chappell jr
he moves in a little closer and drops his voice somewhat
watches him warily
lets stop fencing with words huh
bernard told me to come here just before he died
this man is
you know it as well as i do
now i came to make a business proposition
and i dont see how you can turn it down
ambrose chappell looks over to a man stuffing animals corpse
what did you have in mind
you want to talk here
we have no secrets from our employees
first of all i havent uttered one word of what bernard told to before he died
and i wont
frankly im not interested in political intrigue and i dont care who it is youre going to kill here in london
all i want is that boy and ill get on the first plane for america
when ben begins mentioning a killing chappell jrs face takes on a look of alarm almost panic
he moves back from ben watching him like a deadly cobra
ben however now convinced that he has the right man in front of him moves in on him to finish his proposition
now that isnt all
if money will do anything
converted to pdf by www
now seems thoroughly frightened
he moves back from ben almost stumbling
he turns goes back to the door of a small office in which is now standing chappell sr
leans closer to the open door as the son speaks urgently and sotto voce to him
father phone the police
now turns back toward ben trying to assume a pleasant and casual manner
now sir shall we go into this a little more carefully
you said something about money
workmen are pausing in their work to look at the pair wondering at the mention of money
you told him to call the police
now dont try to bluff me like that
he reaches out quickly grabs chappell jr
by the label
the man gives an involuntary cry of fear
is on the phone
this is ambrose chappells burdett street
will you send someone round at once
glancing toward him theres is an extraordinary individual here and we really cant cope with him
struggles to get loose from bens grasp
let me go
converted to pdf by www
you dont know louis bernard
ive never heard of him
and you dont have any idea what went on in marrakesh yesterday or where my boy is
no of course not
ben lets go of chappell jr
and turns in confusion
the workmen drop their tools and move in on ben quickly and threateningly
even chappell sr
comes out of the office in alarm
ben backs away toward the door
now just a minute
take it easy
i obviously got the wrong place
now stay away from me
but they dont
they come on
ben looks quickly around for a weapon or an exit
he sees the door and moves quickly toward it but the workmen are faster than he is
two of them bar the exit
ben tries to shove them out of the way and get through the door
the men grapple with him
himself and another workman rush in endeavoring to subdue ben
a silent but furious struggle ensues
it is now a complete melee between the four men and ben as they try to hold him down
till the police come
ben breaks loose temporarily trying to find another escape
he realizes that the time for talking is past
but as fast as he is the men are on him again
they twist and struggle through the stuffed and mounted animals
there is a melange of lion heads swordfish and other partially completed jobs
sometimes ben in his struggles comes face to face with the angry head of a bared teeth lion
ambrose chappell jr
himself at one point finds the swordfish a very painful object somewhere about his anatomy
ben eventually wrenches himself free
converted to pdf by www
shooting toward the doorway
the confusion gives him a free moment
he makes the door twists it open and dashes out into the yard
suddenly he turns back and dashes in again
the man retreat in fear
ben picks up his fallen hat and dashes out again
the five persons in the mckenna suits are sitting around
all but jo have drinks in their hands
she seems to be absorbed in her own thoughts but val parnell is holding forth oblivious at first to her disinterest
and back at our flat after the first night chris had the nerve to suggest that the sketch where bud flanagan comes in dressed up as the countess was unconvincing
that no matter how well got up bud flanagan was even if he were dressed by hartnell nobody would believe he was an aristocrat
so i said look chris why dont you cut william hickeys column out of the paper
he stops talking as he looks across at the silent jo
helen and the others follow his look
they watch her sympathetically
jo seems totally unaware that anyone else is in the room staring into thin air absorbed with thoughts of her own
whats become of that unpredictable husband of yours
consults his watch hes been gone over an hour
she doesnt answer so he goes on
who was it he went to see
some man named
looks at group for help what was it

slowly jos expression begins to chance to one of interest
we see a flood of thoughts expressed in her face
she looks across at val and replies no
you mean chappell
she rises from her chair with some excitement
she murmurs almost to herself its not a man its a place
it has to be
the others watch jo puzzled at her strange performance
no one dares speak until she finds out what it means
with some excitement jo addresses val parnell
do they list chapels in the london telephone directory
lets a take a look
he crosses to the telephone desk picks up telephone directory and opens it
insert of telephone directory vals finger lands on ambrose chapel ambrose street west two
excitedly here it is ambrose chapel ambrose street west two
he turns triumphantly to jo
without hesitation she crosses to a table takes her purse
she hurries to the door without a word then turns to them
im very sorry
converted to pdf by www
but have another drink and please explain to ben when he comes in
she hurries out the door
the others are left standing looking at each other
val and helen speak almost at the same time asking each other the same question
jo hurrying down street towards chapel seen in b
jo enters and stares off at the chapel
of chapel as seen by jo
jo wondering if this really is the right place
she decides she had better phone ben and turns out of shot
the parnell party are still wondering what all this is about
theres something weird going on around here that i cant follow
lets see if we can figure this out
first of all there was a man named to uh
and ben rushed off to see him
converted to pdf by www
then jo said it wasnt a man but a place and she dashed off
dont mention it again or i might dash off
what a temptation
can you fathom it val
val paces thoughtfully and they watch him
it must be a now american gag
ill ask danny about it
at that moment the door suddenly opens
everyone turns in surprise
ben is standing in the doorway
he comes slowly into the room closing the door
he is very tired looking and disheveled
they watch him enter silently
too tired to say anything at first ben drops into the first chair he comes to
then he looks up
val walks over to him hands him a ready made drink
ben takes it but doesnt have time to drink when val speaks
shes just gone off to ambrose chapel
immediately ben puts down the drink
but but thats where ive been
he stands up
it isnt your ambrose chapel
ben looks at him questioningly
it isnt a he

converted to pdf by www
shes just gone there
ben studies the group trying to appraise in his mind what they have said
where is it
whats the address
val crosses to find the phone book on the desk and looks for address
ambrose street bayswater
ben moves quickly to the door and goes out into corridor as telephone rings
jan answers it
she puts down the receiver and shouts out to ben
come back its jo
ben comes quickly into the room pushing his way through everyone
he goes immediately to the phone
jan hands ben the receiver
jo is overjoyed to hear bens voice
ben ben darling

converted to pdf by www
then it must be the chapel and ive found it ben
its just a short way from here
it was a crazy thing to do interrupting hurriedly i have the address jo
now stay there until i get there
and dont do anything
jo loses some of her anxiety
ill meet you outside
she hangs up sighs and starts out of the phone booth
ben hangs up the phone and starts for the door
he looks back at the group as he pauses in doorway
will you stick around
well be back as soon as we can
i dont know how to thank you
he goes out through the door closing it
everyone stands staring at the door
jo stands watching something across the street
from jos viewpoint the exterior of ambrose chapel
an old building silent and deserted
a faded sign outside identifies it
converted to pdf by www
a non conformist chapel
empty except for one figure a woman laying out music on the organ rack in the front of the chapel
the camera moves in on her and as she turns on her way to the hymn board we see that she is mrs
at the hymn board she slips into it a series of hymn numbers
the camera then pans her across the empty chapel to a side door
she goes through it
she comes up a flight of stairs the camera moving with her
she stops at a door on the first landing takes a key out of her pocket and unlocks the door
inside of a small almost bare room mrs
drayton closes the door behind her and stands with her back to it watching
the camera pans slightly to reveal the rest of the room
sitting at a small table is a listless young hank mckenna
he is playing checkers with the woman we saw at the airport who was standing with the autograph hunters watching jo mckenna
the one with the dirty glasses who made a phone call
hank has caught the woman in a checker trap and with obvious satisfaction jumps three of her men
you dont know much about checkers do you
its time you went to bed dear
youll get tired out
can i finish
yes you finish
edna see that he gets some milk and biscuits
and hed better have another sleeping pill
ive got to get downstairs to hank youll go to sleep hank wont you
converted to pdf by www
i guess so
hurry up if you want to finish this game
look it doesnt hurt to be kind
yell out when you want me to open the door
edna studies the board with a frown
drayton smiles and goes out the door
in the corridor once again mrs
drayton locks the door and crosses the hall
the camera panning her
she enters another door
she enters a larger more ornate room
the camera pans her in and we see first drayton who is putting on a surplice and then the man who knocked on the mckennas door in the mamounia hotel
looking for someone named montgomery
he is putting on a tie and tuxedo
he wears a dangerous looking revolver strapped underneath his armpit mrs
drayton without a word sits down and lights a cigarette exhaling with something close to fatigue
then she speaks
i wish it was tomorrow
drayton turns having finished his dressing
coldly thats not a very orthodox sentiment
he goes to a desk and takes something out of a drawer
it is a small envelope
he turns to the man with the gun
two excellent tickets for the concert at the albert hall with my compliments
he hands them to rien
rien takes the envelope glances at it briefly then puts it into his pocket
your box is nicely placed or shall we say strategically placed
converted to pdf by www
he goes to a portable record player which is open and has a record on it
he looks down at the phonograph
now for the most important part
he gestured towards the record
what is it
a record of the delightful picco they will play tonight
what about it
music is less in your line than marksmanship
if you will listen my friend i will play for you the exact moment at which you can shoot
now listen carefully
drayton plays the record
let me do it for you again
now listen for the cymbal crash
drayton plays the record again and claps his hands together at the cymbal crash
you see at such a moment your shot will not be heard
the listeners will not even be disturbed
i think the composer would have appreciated that
no one will know
none except one you mean
the assassin smiles
ah yes if you are clever my friend
any questions musical or otherwise
theress one comforting thought
it happens early in the evening
i hope i wont upset you if i say theres time for one shot only
if you need another the risk is yours
converted to pdf by www
i do not take risks
thats a comfort traipsing all the way down to marrakesh to fetch you i should like you to do me credit
he looks at his watch
your distinguished targets on the way there now
a car is waiting for you downstairs at the back entrance
you will pick up a miss benson on your way
she will be your companion in the box
shes there to lend an air of respectability
if thats possible
you will have the money when i return
i think you can trust me
looking him up and down what is your english proverb a wolf in sheeps clothing
i think you had better be going
it is impolite to be late for a concert
it would be awkward if they made you wait until the first selection is over
he turns to his wife
see him downstairs my dear
to rien im sorry you must sneak out the back way but we have to preserve our respectable front
she exits with the assassin
drayton turns to the mirror and surveys himself
in the distance jo is seen pacing
to rear door of the chapel opens and mrs
drayton pushes rien out
he crosses and enters a waiting car
the car drives off
converted to pdf by www
the shadows of the day are lengthening as ben gets out of a taxi and approaches jo standing on the sidewalk
his fatigue of before seems to have vanished in his eagerness to meet jo and find out what she knows
ben comes up to her
she grips his hands
there it is
you may have just hit it right on the nose
you cant be farther wrong than i was with my ambrose chapel
ben should we get some help from the police
no honey please no lets take a crack at this alone
the chapel as seen from their viewpoint
people are now entering it but it seem as if the tag end of the congregation is entering because the service is obviously under way the sound of hymn singing
coming across faintly to us
ben takes her hand squeezes it affectionately
together they cross the street the camera panning them up the steps of the chapel and to the entrance
they enter the chapel from the rear looking around cautiously
a hymn is in progress
the chapel holds about three hundred people
it is of the non conformist type and the congregation consists mostly of middle aged and elderly women
although the mckennas are not aware of it we notice that the organist is none other than edna the woman who observed jo at the airport and later took care
converted to pdf by www
carefully the mckennas find their way to a back row seat
one or two of the women in the back row turn to look at the new arrivals
jo wants to whisper something to ben but with a gesture he silences her
ben picks up hymnal hands her one finds the right page and begins to sing along with the hymn
but instead of following the words of the hymn ben makes up his own words to communicate with jo as he looks around at the chapel
singing this looks like mother wild goose chase
singing them lets wait and look around
some of the parishioners turn and listen to jos voice because it has a professional quality that rises above the rest
whether they are watching her in suspicion or admiration is hard to tell
jo turns her attention to the hymn book trying to be unnoticed
bens eyes catch something coming down the aisle
singing look whos coming down the aisle
jo follows his glance leaning forward a little and to one side
coming up the aisle with a collection basket collecting money during the hymn is mrs
she is approaching the row in which the mckennas are standing
jo looks towards ben helplessly
drayton is between the two of them and any possible exit
ben immediately eases his way along behind a column which hides him somewhat from the front but not from the side
jo endeavors to shrink her body behind a tall woman in front of her but she is not entirely successful
we can see mrs
drayton getting closer to them
jo looks toward ben almost panicked
drayton has reached the end of their row
she pushes forward her collection plate and as she does so her face blanches
she instantly identifies the two
ben with little else to do looks her straight in the eye and puts some coins into her plate
converted to pdf by www
as the astonished mrs
drayton turns to go back down the aisle with her plate of coins and bills we now see the surpliced mr
drayton ascending the pulpit
he looks down to his wife
draytons viewpoint as he notices his wife coming up the aisle with a startled expression on her face
she tries to nod with her head to indicate something important lies behind her
drayton trying to puzzle out her alarm studies her face and then lifts his eyes to look beyond her
the expression on his face leaves no doubt that he cannot understand what shes trying to convey
the hymn has come an end and the congregation starts seating itself
the mckennas take a seat along with the rest and as yet they are relatively inconspicuous from the front of the chapel
ben takes a piece of paper out of his pocket examines it and satisfied it is the right one hands it to his wife
the congregation falls silent as drayton is apparently about to begin his sermon
drayton glances down to his bible opens it a certain page and as he does so he looks at his wife who is sitting near the organ
she half turns to look up at him
she seems frightened
drayton fumbles with the pages of the bible apparently trying to make something out of his wifes attitude
failing he looks up and begins his sermon
he speaks into a microphone
brothers and sisters the subject of my address this evening is adversity
the average life yours and mine is often harassed and perplexed by cruelties and disappointments beyond our control
strangely enough it is often the things beyond our control which help to make us better beings
converted to pdf by www
pain and tribulation are the testing ground of life and let us be grateful for them
let us bless the disappointments and the frustrations and say a prayer for the agony of the moment
only thus shall we confirm and re confirm our own goodness and therefore the essential goodness of all mankind
half glancing at drayton as he delivers his sermon
ben talks to jo
their conversation is whispered
thats buchanans phone number
go on out and call him and ask him to surround the place with police
what if he asks me
tell him everything
this is the time
im sure hank is around here some place
ben i dont want to leave you
i dont know how else to do it honey
ben gives her a gentle push
with a regretful look at him she slides out of the seat
in the middle of his sermon drayton looks up
he almost falters and stops as he sees jo rise from her seat
the chapel as seen from draytons viewpoint
jo has turned up the aisle and gone out the door at the back
drayton composes his face but his eyes are serious
without the slightest pause he continues his sermon shifting his ideas in mid paragraph
few of us pause to think how lifes adversities work in our behalf to make better men and women of us
converted to pdf by www
but i believe we should pause now to do a little stock taking to look into our own hearts and see what we find there
therefore instead of continuing the service i think we should all return to our homes for private meditation remembering how little we have to complain of and how much to
be grateful for
next week i shall discuss the fruits of our meditation
until then my blessing upon each and every one of you
ben watches drayton with little charity in his heart
there is a stir in the congregation when drayton tells them to go home
they look at each other uncertainly
drayton closes the bible and begins to descend from the pulpit
the congregation comes to life
the members rise from their seats and begin filing out of the chapel
occasionally they cast backward glances toward the pulpit as if surprised at what they have heard
when drayton reaches the two steps of the altar he beckons the organist to him
she comes and he whispers something to her
he then motions his wife nearer to him and also whispers something to her
drayton goes off through a side door by the altar while the organist makes her way down the aisle through the congregation to stand by the door
the camera pans ben as he threads his way up through the women who are filing out
drayton stands at the front of the chapel waiting
finally after a slow and deliberate walk up the now nearly empty chapel ben comes face to face with drayton
drayton greets him with bland amiability
well this is a pleasant surprise doctor
wheres my boy drayton
converted to pdf by www
as a matter of fact youve just come in time to help my wife with hanks food
seems hank doesnt care much for english cooking
draytons eyes stray to the back of the church as he talks
ben noticing draytons eye movement follows it cautiously
but before he can confirm his suspicions there is a loud clang of a door closing that gives him his answer
he looks around quickly
at the other end of the chapel the woman edna has just closed the door and is in the process of locking the heavy iron lock with a large key
she extracts the key and puts it into her pocket
ben turns back to drayton to find that his manner has changed somewhat
he grabs him quickly by the throat of his robes
what do you want
ill give you money and keep my mouth shut
all i want is my boy
and what about your wife
did she go outside just to get some fresh air
tell me what you want
ill do anything
all right youll see your boy in good time
with a sudden twist he wrenches himself away from ben
he reaches for a button on the altar presses it
instantly the door by the side of the altar opens and two rather strong men appear
ben turns alertly to face them backing of a little
one of the men is obviously the chauffeur type and the other one a handyman type in his shirtsleeves
ben takes this in and notices the open door behind them
ben maneuvers himself toward the pulpit and suddenly dashes for the steps
converted to pdf by www
he surprises them with his speed and before anyone can stop him he is in the pulpit
he grabs the microphone previously used by drayton in his sermon
he yells into it
where are you
as the sound roars through he chapel the two man dash for the pulpit and at that mount we hear faintly off the voice of hank daddy
daddy im here
dad his voice is choked off
ben jumps down from the pulpit in an effort to make for the open door but the two men throw themselves on top of him
jo speaks into the phone with great urgency
and ben is in there now watching the both of them
woburn assistant to buchanan is listening intently on the phone
the office behind him is not handsomely appointed
jos voice is heard on filter
he sent me out to call you so we could do something before they get away
i see mrs
mckenna and you believe your son is somewhere in the chapel
i dont know i dont know where he is
but at least these people will know the draytons
if youd only send somebody to get them
im afraid it isnt quite as easy as all that
jo interrupts him impatient with his caution
converted to pdf by www
woburn there isnt any time
my husband is sitting in that chapel waiting for me to bring some help
cant i talk with mr
he said when we needed him to call
woburn is concerned
im awfully sorry but i simply cant get hold of him just now
hes gone to a rather important diplomatic affair at the albert hall
jo is tired of his talk
she wants action

as he talks woburn reaches for a pad d a pencil and begins making some notes
hes on his way
i dont know quite filter then cant you do anything right away before we lose the draytons
i assure you ill do all i cant as soon as i can
jo is at the frantic point

converted to pdf by www
woburn finishes making his notes
he reaches for another phone with his left hand and dials a number as he talks to jo
efficiently that wont be necessary
ill see that the chapel is put under immediate observation
by the time you get back a police car should be there
please return to your husband tell him to come straight out of the chapel and let the police take over
he turns to the other phone
woburn special branch hold on
to the other phone i must ring off now mrs
please believe me ill have everything laid on
with a feeling of frustration jo hangs up the phone as woburn clicks off on the other end
she exits to the phone booth
the back door of the chapel opens and drayton hank and mrs
drayton locks chapel door and crosses to a waiting car
they all get in and the car moves off
jo hurries up the street towards ambrose chapel
jo turns the corner heading for the chapel
the doors of the chapel are closed
it seems strangely deserted
converted to pdf by www
jo hurries across the street and up the steps to the chapel
she tries the door
the door locked
she tries it again
it does not give
she bangs her on the door
no one answers
jos face is puzzled and a frightened
the camera pans jo to the right side of the chapel
she looks down the length of it
no sign of anyone
the camera pans jo to the right side of the chapel
there is no sign of life down the whole side of it
jo returns to the front door examines it tries it again
now there is definite panic in her face
there is the sudden sound of a car pulling up quickly to the curb
a police car has pulled up to the curb
there are four men in it
the camera pans jo from the front of the chapel down to the police car
three men are getting out leaving the driver inside
jo comes up to the three men
one of them in charge does the talking
theres nobody there
are you mrs
converted to pdf by www
yes but somethings wrong
a few minutes ago the place was full of people and now theres nobody
two of the police move up toward the chapel
patterson glances at it
our orders are to keep it under observation until a scotland yard car arrives
my husbands in there
there must have been thirty or forty people
patterson looks at her carefully
when was this
it couldnt have been more than five minutes ago
interrupting lets take a look
i told mr
woburn he had to hurry
the camera pans the two of them up to the chapel
the other police have gone down the sides for an inspection
patterson and jo go to the main door
patterson tries it
i tried that
its looked lets force it open
im sorry madam we cant break in
sympathetic requires a search warrant
its the law you see

they start around the corner to inspect the sides of the chapel
patterson and jo peer in the windows
they apparently see nothing
another policeman is checking the windows on the other side
the third policeman is checking the alleyway in back of the chapel
he sees no sign of anything suspicious
patterson and jo come around the back and try the back door
the back door is firmly locked
theres no one there sir
are you quite certain the place was full of people only a few minutes ago
of course im certain
i was there myself sitting next to my husband
he sent me out to call scotland yard
he looks at her quizzically
its much too complicated to explain
well just have to sit tight and wait for the car to arrive from the yard
he starts for the front of the chapel and jo unhappily is forced to follow
converted to pdf by www
the chapel is deserted inside
in the dim light we can see a form stretched out on the floor
it is ben
he begins to stir a little as if just beginning to come to after being knocked unconscious
the policemen are grouped around the patrol car as patterson the sergeant talks over a radio telephone
so far as we can make out sir theres no sign of life
i see very good sir
he hangs up and gets out of the open car
he turns to one of his men
walden youll stay here till the car arrives from the yard
thats all matthews
the other policeman gets into the car leaving the door open for the sergeant
youre not leaving
politely orders madam
can we give you lift somewhere
jo is frustrated and irritated but she thinks for a moment and makes a sudden decision
yes i want to go to albert hall
patterson looks at her with tolerant surprise
afraid the albert halls a bit off our beat
suppose we drop you at the nearest taxi rank
jo looks back at the chapel briefly
converted to pdf by www
they get into the car and the camera pans it as it drives away down the long victoria london street which now remains deserted
the exterior rear of a huge residential building such as is to be found in kensington palace gardens or belgrave square
the camera pans down and we see a humber car driving through the gates at the rear
it pulls up at the service entrance
a man sitting beside the chauffeur gets out of the car
inside the car are the draytons and hark mckenna
we see the man hurry to the door of the kitchen and enter
there is a big staff of kitchen help chefs maids of middle age all preparing food for what is obviously a big party
the man who has entered calls to them to get their attention
the work falls quiet as they become aware of him
everybody out into the corridor
hurry he claps his hands there is a moment of bewilderment and confusion
the man crosses to someone obviously a butler and whispers some words to him
the butler turns to the workers and starts herding them toward the corridor through a door in the far corner of the kitchen
do what he says
it will only be a minute
come on all of you out
the man goes to the door
he leans out the door and beckons the draytons and hank to come in quickly
the three get out of the car and hurry toward the door
the man moves back into the kitchen and goes to stand guard at the doorway through which the workers left
the door is closed
converted to pdf by www
the servants are packed together at one side of the corridor
they are talking grumbling
this embassy theres always something queer going on
while the other servants are grumbling one is saying nothing
he rather a shrewd looking young footman
he strains to listen through closed door
coming from the kitchen are several sounds
a door opening the walking of feet and finally the slam of a door
bringing people in in secret
give me the swiss embassy every time theres neutrality for you
then the sound of a car leaving outside
the door to the kitchen opens and the servants including the young footman enter again
the young footman among the first to enter surveys the kitchen
there is no sign of anyone having passed through
the street before the chapel is still deserted and the light of day is beginning to fade
suddenly the silence is broken by the sound of the bell ringing spasmodically in the chapel belfry
along the street a few people begin putting their heads out of windows and the one policeman left in charge is seen hurrying away down the street
inside the chapel we can see the cause of the spasmodic bell ringing
ben is using the rope to climb out of the chapel
he succeeds in reaching high window
he holds on to the window and looks down
converted to pdf by www
from his viewpoint
he can see people gathering in the street looking up at the chapel
ben decides to swing to the opposite window which will be away from the street
he swings grabs and with some difficulty manages a foothold
he finally climbs out through the window
ben moves cautiously out onto the roof of the chapel
beyond and below him we can see people on the street
he manages to lay low and crawl over the roof the camera panning him
we can now see beyond and below the patrolman returning with two regular uniformed policemen
they are crossing toward the chapel looking up as we shooting through the albert memorial as a foreground piece we see the activities of the arrivals at a big concert
through the archway large limousines are pulling up while on the sidewalk level with the main road odd taxis are pulling in
we see the usual line of posters which run along the edge of the sidewalk
the screen is filled with a large poster
it announces for that evening the commemorative concert
further details on the poster indicate that a cantata will be sung featuring the london symphony orchestra the royal choral society and a name woman as featured mezzo soprano and
conductor bernard herrmann
between the camera and the poster a taxi pulls up
it is near enough to the camera so that just the driver and the door fills the screen jo mckenna steps out the far side and pays off the driver
with a ten shilling note
she hurries away
the driver endeavors to call after her as he turns the note around in his hand
he looks at it with satisfaction and stuffs it into the inner recesses of his clothes
converted to pdf by www
we see jo threading her way across the narrow inner roadway into which large limousines are creeping and depositing indifferently dressed aristocrats
jo finds herself going up the few steps the front door surrounded by a mixture of tattily dressed tiaraed english duchesses and the more elegantly dressed members of the corps
diplomatique men in white tie tails and orders and their more fashionably dressed south american beauties
shooting down from the stone stepped cast iron railinged staircase we see the milling people going off in different directions to their seats
there is a hubbub of voices through which we can hear the programme sellers crying out their wares
jo patiently awaits her turns as two or three people perhaps a couple of chelsea long hairs and one other people who obviously have not reserved ahead of time because
they had no money take their turns at the window
a uniformed attendant standing beside this queue is repeating information for the benefit of the queue
seats at a guinea
starting room three and six jo moves out of the queue and addresses him
rather urgently i would like to see the manager please
im sorry madam the managers on duty in the lobby
sos his assistant
please i must speak to one of them
which are they
vaguely over there somewhere
he resumes his chant
converted to pdf by www
jo turns away disconsolately and starts jo seek these men out for herself
the camera pans her over and she finds herself blocked off by a crowd of four or five feet deep
jo standing on her toes endeavoring to look beyond the block of people
suddenly her face changes as she sees shooting over the head of crowd she sees the arrival of an important personage
he is accompanied by others who are apparently attendants upon him
a couple of the individuals behind him are wearing large order sashes underneath their white waistcoats
the principal figure of this group is an oldish an around sixty
he is in white tie and tails and also wearing a number of foreign orders
about third is line behind him comes buchanan
jo immediately recognizes him
from her viewpoint we see the men she has been seeking possibly the manager of the albert hall his assistant cow towing behind him and alongside of the manager someone
dressed like he might be sir kenneth clarke the head of the arts council the new arrival is greeted
there is an exchange of courtesies after which they are led on toward the beginning of the staircase
as buchanan comes nearer
jo tries to push her way through towards him
the people around her resent her efforts
behind jo are two girls in their early twenties
both are chelsea types
bored is that the prime minister
enthuses no thats only the ambassador
the prime ministers the one with the bald head
converted to pdf by www
well ill guarantee hes got a better seat than we have
the camera pans jo as she does manage to get forward a little but she is caught up in the sudden break up of the people who have lined up
to see arrival
by the time she is in the clear the camera pans her further and over her shoulder we see the last of buchanan and the rest up the staircase followed
by other members of the audience going up in the same direction
we see jos frustration filling her face
she begins to turn her head
she looks down with indecision
in the foreground are passing people hurrying towards their seats
there taking a step forward and staring in jos direction is rien the assassin
his face shows considerable alarm at what he sees
from his viewpoint jo is half turned in his direction
her head is still down
slowly she looks up
her mouth half opens when she sees the man she once saw in the corridor of the hotel at marrakesh
rien with a quick thought hurries over to her
the two are in semi closeup
he says to her quietly you have a very nice little boy madame
he turns to go
jo clutches him and almost cries out
where is he
where is he
rien does not reply
the camera pans him away
we see him join a woman escort and make their way for the staircase
converted to pdf by www
the camera pulls back and we now see that the crowd in the lobby is thinning out
jo stands alone jostled by a stream of late arrivals
from the hall itself we can hear the sound of the orchestra tuning up followed by a burst of applause with a few shouts which obviously herald the arrival of
the visiting dignitary in his box
jo stares toward the opening into the hall
she seems drawn to go in
she crosses and the camera follows her to the first entrance to the outer corridor
jo stands for a moment and then slowly crosses the corridor to the main entrance where the ticket collector and a programme girl stand
as she approaches the opening the ticket collector steps forward
your ticket madam
jo shakes her heads
if you dont mind im just looking for someone
she takes a step or two forward as some new arrivals take up the attention of the ticket collector
the programme girl escorts them out of the scene
jo stares at the vast hall in front of her
from her viewpoint she sees the complete hall the orchestra and choir assembled and a round of applause is heard as the conductor is seen threading his way toward the
instruments and mounts the podium
jo steals a glance toward the box which first catches her eye
converted to pdf by www
from her viewpoint she sees the flag draped box of the foreign visitor
it is full of his entourage and seat slightly to the left of him in the second row buchanan is sitting
nearer to her and in front of buchanan on one side of the dignitary is a be medalled blue sashed individual who might be an ambassador
jo turns her head away and looks at the other side
the camera roves among the boxes
suddenly it stops on one as the assassin takes his seat with his woman escort like any ordinary couple
they are quite casual in their behavior
jo becomes transfixed
a sudden silence returns her attention to the orchestra
from her viewpoint we see the full orchestra the conductor with raised baton
the womens choir raise their sheets of music in unison
from a point high above we see the whole hall the audience and the orchestra
the cantata starts with a roll on the timpani and a burst of music
a nearer view of the orchestra
a whole sweep of the orchestra with the choir predominant
converted to pdf by www
a skimming shot over the top of the orchestra with the strings in the foreground predominant
the sound of these instruments seems to dominate the other music due to their proximity to the camera
the cellos again their sound dominates the scene
the woodwinds the same sound effect
now the brass
their notes drown out the rest of the orchestra
now the double brass
as each of these shots follow in succession we get more intimate with each group of instruments and finally to the timpani where we just hear the kettle drums booming
at last one individual who is seated with legs crossed and arms folded on a chair and beside him on another chair the cymbals
the inert cymbals resting on their chair
rien in his box is glancing toward the orchestra
he looks down beside him and slowly picks something up from a chair
jo stares up and catches her breath
converted to pdf by www
from her viewpoint we see rien is raising a pair of small black leather opera glasses which he puts to his eyes and studies his target
jo turns slowly and looks up at the dignitarys box
he is turning to the man beside him whom we shall later know as the ambassador and indicates with gestures how much he is enjoying the concert
he looks back over his shoulder and gives the same gestures and comments to buchanan
then turning forward he settles back comfortably in his seat to enjoy the music
through the doors we see a taxi pulling away and presently a glass door opens and a dishevelled ben comes into the lobby
he comes up to the camera and looks about him
from his viewpoint the lobby appears empty except perhaps for a solitary uniformed policeman
ben look the other way and upstairs
from his viewpoint the other direction just emptiness
we see bens bewilderment as to what to do and where to go
we pan him up to the first corridor entrance that leads to the main circular corridor
his face lights up
from his viewpoint we see through the opening the ticket collector and the program girl standing at the opening leading down the main aisle
on the right standing with her back to him is jo

the camera pans ben as he hurries forward
he touches jo lightly on the shoulder
she turns startled and manages to suppress an exclamation on seeing him
we do not hear what they are saying but by their pantomime we see that jo is telling ben all about the impending shooting
ben argues with her
he indicates he will tell buchanan
she frantically restrains him but he shakes her off and dashes away
we see ben ascending the stairs originally taken by the dignitary and his group
ben comes into the corridor and looks about him
beyond him we see a group of men obviously detectives and ahead of them a police constable
we see ben hurry in his direction
ben comes up to the constable and is about to pass him when he is stopped
we again do not hear the dialogue but the pantomime shows that ben is trying to get to buchanan
the constable doesnt quite know what to make of bens dramatic plea
he indicates that he must talk to his superior
ben waits impatiently as the constable goes over to one of the inspectors who is standing in a small group a little way off
from his viewpoint we see the constable addressing the inspector with skeptical nods of his head in bens direction
jo looking over her shoulder and then up to the box of the dignitary
she turns desperately towards the direction of the assassins box
another view of the orchestra but the duration of it on the screen is much quicker
a flash of the violins

a flash of the cellos
a quick flash of the brass
a timpani section
the cymbals still laying on the chair
the inspector is turning to ben the constable on one side
again in pantomime the inspector questioning the impatient ben
he leaves ben and goes over to the men standing outside the door to the box
ben half turns away with exasperation toward the camera
the conductor in the foreground
we see a quick shot of the orchestra beyond
we see a different angle the cymbals filling the screen
camera pulls back quickly and the man who is to wield them unfolds his arms and uncrosses his legs
he leans forward to glance at his score
ben is still waiting for the inspector to discuss matters with the plainclothesman
he turns and hurries away the camera panning him
converted to pdf by www
jo is almost weeping with the effect of the singing and the emotional stress she is going through
in the orchestra the cymbal player now places one hand on the cymbals on the chair
in the box the assassin places his hand for the first time inside his coat towards his holster
the camera pulls back to show the woman sitting with him seeing this gesture rising and backing away into the dark recesses of the box
ben is now quickly listening into the section behind the boxes one of which is occupied by the assassin
ben looks along the corridor
from his viewpoint we see rows of boxes
ben is a little nonplussed
he approaches one
the plainclothesmen and two uniformed policemen are now coming toward camera looking for the departed ben
back in the orchestra the conductor is wielding his baton vigorously
he swings over a sheet of music
the choir turns over their music
converted to pdf by www
the cymbal player turns over his music
he looks at the music in front of him and for the first time picks up the cymbals
a closer view of ben shows him trying another door cautiously and surreptitiously
he looks in and then softly closes the door
he moves further along and tries another door with the same cautious movement
the assassin now has his gun out in the darkness of the rear of the box
the cymbal player watching his music his cymbals held
from his viewpoint with the cymbals tipping the bottom of the screen we see all his music
it is blank
the camera swiftly moves in to the bottom of the right hand page showing the one note he is to strike
jo becoming more anxious and desperate
she looks up towards the assassins box with horror as she sees the assassins figure moving forward and the tip of the gun for the first time
the conductor looks up towards the cymbal player
the player raises the cymbals

he again closes it and moves to one more
the dignitarys pleased and smiling face

the cymbals are held in the foreground and through them we can see the orchestra and the conductor beyond
the conductor looks up from his score and points deliberately to the cymbal player
the cymbals clash together
jo leaping forward with a scream
the dignitary is clutching his arm and slumping forward
we gain an impression of those around leaping to their feet
the people around jo startled as they rise in their seats and turn back to her
ben dashes to a final door and swinging it open finds himself face to face with the assassin
the latters hand goes for his holster
he pulls out his gun
ben lunges forward with a blow
the assassin staggers back and we hear the clatter of the gun as it falls to the floor
converted to pdf by www
he immediately turns towards the camera looking for a means of escape
he leaps to the edge of the box to go over into the next one
we see the assassin fall with a crash into the aisle below him as ben dashes forward in the box
the soprano singers in the middle of their note quickly change it to a unified scream
the music trails off as the orchestra rises to its feet at the startling occurrence
the hall is in an uproar
the people around the dignitary in his box are backing up to give him air
someone is examining his wound
he see by his movements and a shake of his head that he is not dead
jo is still standing looking up
from her viewpoint she sees ben leaning over the box in horror looking down at the dead assassin below
the door opens and the uniformed and plainclothes police dash into the box
there is utter confusion in the lobby police dashing upstairs on either side
we see ben hurrying down the stairs
jo rushes into the lobby and seeing ben dashes towards him
converted to pdf by www
a few of the people around the lobby begin to look at jo and ben
we see the assistant manager hurry over to them
they are in a group of three and although we do not actually hear what he says due to the hubbub he is obviously questioning ben and being solicitous to
we go close just in time to catch the tail end of the conversation
ben is just saying then he didnt kill him
your wife saved him it is only a small flesh wound
oh here he is now
you must come and meet him
dont be nervous
ill get the aide to present you
it will be all right to woburn would you present the lady to the prime minister
suddenly their attention is drawn to something off screen up the stairs
the hubbub increases
from their viewpoint we see the prime minister obviously not wounded sufficiently to incapacitate being escorted down the stairs by his aide and other members of the staff including woburn
of the special branch
the prime minister is indicating his arm and obviously by the way he waves his hands is deprecating their concern about his wound
in fact he is rather over doing it
just beyond them at the top of the stairs we see buchanan standing with the ambassador
buchanan is reassuring the ambassador
ill report to you fully at the embassy your excellency
in the meantime
the manager is leading ben and jo across to the foot of the stairs
they are reluctant but he insists
as the camera pans them over they meet the group at the bottom at the stairs
the manager calls out to mr
woburn and indicates ben and jo
converted to pdf by www
woburn is a little non plussed
he leans over to one of the prime ministers aides
the latters face lights up
he leans over and whispers something to the prime minister
the prime minister is all smiles
woburn steps down and introduces ben and jo to the prime ministers aide
prime minister this is the lady who the prime minister interrupts enthusiastically
my dear lady i shall be for ever in your debt
and this is her husband the prime minister interrupts again less enthusiastically
a pleasure my dear sir
he turns to jo i trust you will permit me to wait upon you tomorrow and to express the depth of my gratitude
weakly it wasnt it wasnt gallantly oh but it was my dear lady
there is an awkward pause
the prime minister collects himself and turns to move on out of the hall the police making a passageway for him through the crowd
we see the ambassador hurrying into the picture and moving across the screen quickly to follow the prime minister
ben and jo stand for a moment not knowing what to do or where to go next
woburn standing with ben and jo
they look up and see buchanan
converted to pdf by www
i think mr
buchanan would like to talk to you
from their viewpoint a grim buchanan is standing at the top of the stairs
the camera pans ben and jo up the stairs towards buchanan
they increase their pace towards him
when they reach him they have only one thought in their minds to ask him
wildly wheres our boy
quietly we can talk if youll come in here
the camera pans the three across the top landing and to the doors of the green room there are various police standing about and some of special branch men can
be seen inside the room
buchanan steps aside too allow jo to enter
then he and ben follow her in
the door closes behind them
the three of them enter the green room generally used by the principal artistes appearing at royal albert hall
buchanan nods to two special branch men who are standing about in case they are needed
the room is informal containing arm chairs a sofa and a number of small tables
jo sits down wearily into the nearest chair
ben remains standing buchanan takes a seat in a chair near a telephone he looks up at ben as if he expects him to say something
ben responds to the look
coldly so you both know the time and place all along
roughly dont be a fool
converted to pdf by www
an odd coincidence both of you turning up here
coldly too bad you didnt contact your assistant
he sent us both here
quickly i beg your pardon
you see we finally needed that help you offered
we still need it
urgently yes mr
we still need it
the door opens and another member of the special branch enters
buchanan nods to him to speak
weve questioned the woman
said she bought a ticket that happened to place her in the same box with the man that did the shooting
doesnt know anything but if she does shes not talking
ill see her later
very good sir
the detective exits as ben sits down dejectedly in a chair
gently please tell me everything now
go turns to jo theres still plenty of room for hope mrs
a high camera shows us a large hallway and ornate ballroom
converted to pdf by www
as yet the room is about quarter filled and various guests of the diplomatic corps and others are gradually adding to the group
the camera dollies down over them until it reaches slightly open doorway
peering cautiously through we see the face of drayton
on the other side of the doorway is drayton and his wife
she is pacing nervously behind him
a footman comes up to them and announces his excellency will see you now
drayton motions to his wife and the camera pans them after the footman across a small hallway
he is the very same footman we saw among the group of servants who were herded out of the kitchen
he opens a door in front of the draytons they enter
standing in front of a fireplace above which is an oil painting of the prime minister is the ambassador whom we saw at the albert hall
he is on the telephone
well if the woman wont talk she wont talk and thats that i suppose
drayton closes the door behind the two as drayton advances towards the ambassador with an easy manner the camera panning him
easily excuse me sir i have a lot to explain to you something very unusual has happened
i must also have the money to pay our french marksman
almost casually wouldnt it be superfluous considering that hes dead
drayton and his wife stare mutely at the ambassador
they are staggered at this news
converted to pdf by www
his aim wasnt quite as good as you led me to expect
the target merely received a slight flesh wound in the arm
worse than useless
drayton still stares petrified at the ambassador
then your french friend panicked and made a fatal crash landing on the floor of the albert hall
blustering weakly i dont see how you can hold me responsible
he was most warmly recommended by our people in marrakesh
the ambassador now begins to get really nasty
im glad youre able to treat the matter so lightly
i am holding a reception here this evening
in a few minutes i have to welcome our prime minister as my guest of honor when i hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend
that amuses you no doubt
feebly i dont know what to say
but i do
youve muddled everything from the start
kidnapping that child in marrakesh
dont you realize that americans dislike having their children kidnapped
trying to keep his end up how else could i make sure the american would hold his tongue
ignoring this and then to crown it all you get cold feet and come running along here to hide and bring the child with you dont you see what youve
done to the diplomatic status of this embassy
converted to pdf by www
weakly i didnt think
i only thought
staccato how are you going to get the child out of here eh
struggling for self confidence theres no difficulty about that surely
the car interrupting with plain clothes detectives planted right round this building
wryly you english intellectuals will be the death of us all
desperate ill think of some method
just give me time
he snorts contemptuously time
the ambassador paces a moment suppressing his rage and then he stops and looks at drayton as if thinking about something
i want the child removed from this embassy and removed in such a way that he wont be able to say any more where he has been tonight
the ambassador pauses and looks up at her in such a manner that she almost shrinks
she tries to say something but no words come out of her half open mouth
drayton however answers the ambassador with horrible servility
right ill see to it
lucy drayton looks at her husband with loathing
there is a polite tap on the door
the ambassador looks up
converted to pdf by www
the door opens and a butler enters
your excellency the princess should be arriving at any moment
the ambassador braces himself his chest swells out a little h assumes a set smile and strides from the room
just at this moment we hear a string orchestra in the distance strike up some gay waltz music
the ambassador goes out of the door
drayton is looking down at the floor
ben is talking
buchanan is listening carefully
recognized him and he recognized me
so he jumped for it
and that is all
slowly trying to liquidate one of their own big shots
i wish theyd stick to their usual custom and do it in their own country
at this moment the phone rings
woburn who is now re placing the two special branch men in the room picks up the telephone
he listens for a moment hold on
he turns the telephone over to buchanan
to phone buchanan speaking
buchanan listens for a while his face changing as he listens with increased interest
buchanan hangs up turns to woburn but half speaks in the direction of the mckennas
converted to pdf by www
the draytons are at the embassy
how do you know
we have ways of finding out from the inside
ben almost shouts as he gets up from his chair
if the draytons are at the embassy hank has to be there too
buchanan turns his attention back to ben
grimly youre probably right
but we can do nothing
why cant you
every embassy in a foreign country has extra territorial rights
what does that mean in common language
as far as were concerned this embassy stands on foreign soil
does that mean they can steal children and get away with it
we could have the foreign office serve a writ on the ambassador
he breaks off and speaks apologetically as if it were i parenthesis
you know im not responsible for the complications of international law
he resumes if only we had positive proof that the boy really is in there
converted to pdf by www
as they are talking ben is thinking hard obviously hatching some scheme in his mind
whats the telephone number of this embassy
both of the men looking at ben a moment without answering and then woburn speaks first
what are you thinking about ben
without answering jo ben picks up the phone
ben looks at the group briefly
buchanan looks at ben with keen curiosity
im going to speak to the minister himself
buchanan looks intrigued and surprised
we hear the answering click on the other end of the phone
may i speak to the prime minister please
there is a pause and the distorted sound of a voice mumbling on the other end of the phone
ben interrupts the question
tell him the lady who saved his life wants to speak to him
the voice on the other end of the phone mumbles briefly and there is silent
ben has a satisfied look on his face as he hands the receiver to jo
she seems frightened
what am i supposed to say ben
i dont know she trails off ben half looking at woburn and buchanan gives her instructions
he said he wanted to visit us soon so he could thank you
converted to pdf by www
well tell him wed like to see him tonight at the embassy because we have to leave london tomorrow
in the ambassadors study underneath the oil painting of himself the prime minister is escorted to a telephone by the butler who hands him the instrument
having been told who was on the other and of the line he is all smiles as he greets jo
my dear lady
this is a charming surprise
he listens to the other end of the phone agreeably making sounds such as ah ha ah hum then he speaks with a gracious sweep of his hand and a
half bow to the telephone
delighted delighted delighted
the ambassador too will be delighted
any friends of mine are friends of his
we will drink a little toast to your country and to mine
peacefully we will co exist
he looks up to admire the painting of himself on the wall
jo hangs up the phone a little surprised and still considerably nervous
to ben he said all right
a taxi pulls up in the front of the large old fashioned embassy
the windows are brightly lighted evidence of a social occasion
ben and jo get out of the taxi
ben pays the driver takes jos arm and they start up the steps of the embassy

ben presses the doorbell
his grip on joss arm slides down to her hand
he holds it tightly
the door opens and a liveried man ushers them in with gesture
they enter a large hallway
the liveried man closes the door
standing in a nearby doorway is a group of people listening to the music of a string quartet playing in the room beyond
included in the group is the personal aide of the prime minister
he sees jo and ben enter hurries over to them smiling and eager
the piece that the string quartet is playing ends amid a round of polite applause
there are people rising from their chairs and a general movement out into the hallway
would you come this way please
the prime minister is waiting for you
following the aide ben and jo squeeze through the crowded doorway
the aide leads ben and jo through the main room the camera dollies them
as they move through the room people begin to notice them first of all because they are not dressed for the occasion but then the looks seem to be admiring
ones and there is a smattering of applause at their passage
apparently people recognize them
the aide takes them to the prime minister who is just getting up from his seat of honor in the first row
the prime minister recognizes them immediately and comes forward quickly to meet them
effusively good evening good evening

all eyes are on jo
jo adjusts herself at the piano
her face seems serious
she looks up briefly with her eyes to check where ben is
the people in the hallway realizing there is to be more entertainment move toward the main room
a tries out the keys of the piano
people are finding their seats
there is coughing shuffling of feet and then a gradual hush
ben watches jo and at the same time seems to be looking around the room particularly toward the various exits
having strummed a few notes jo settles down and plays the introduction to her song
we see the great tenseness on her face interposed with professional smiles which she bestows on those nearest her but always the tenseness returns
as she sings her voice seem to be rather overpowering
it fills the whole room with quite a volume
it almost seems out of place that she has become so professional in such an intimate drawing room setting
everyone in the ballroom is listening intently and with surprise at her singing

the first landing on the flight of stairs above the hallway
no one is around
jos voice loses some of its volume

we now hear the song floating up clearly but much diminished
in a room on the other side of the door hank mckenna is listening to the music
hank seems a little puzzled
then his face lights up and he jumps suddenly to his feet
he runs towards the door and begins trying to open it
thats my mothers voice
thats my mother singing

hank are you sure
are you really sure
hank turns around at the doorway to look at mrs
i know it

mrs draytons face still awed by what she has heard
what is she doing here
hank a little mystified has no answer
he walks slowly back into the room towards mrs
drayton listening and thinking about what he hears
draytons face shows a new and dangerous thought coming into it
she looks down at hank
can you whistle that song
he looks at her and nods abstractedly
i guess so
she kneels down quickly to him
then go on whistle it
whistle it as loud as you can
on hanks face comes a little understanding
he can barely believe what she means
then he understands
he turns and deliberately facing the door starts to whistle the song
he whistles loud and vigorously
drayton stands up and moves back to a chair as she watches him
down in the ballroom jo is looking up anxiously as she sings
she deliberately breaks and pauses for a moment and softens her accompaniment
then she hears it a faint whistle coming from above not enough for those around to appreciate it but loud enough for the straining ears of jo
she looks across the ballroom to find ben and her eyes go up
converted to pdf by www
watching her ben understands
he gives her the slightest sign of agreement
jo continues her song with almost excitement in her singing voice
the camera passes around her as it follows ben as he walks along the wall slowly
ben makes his way along the wall toward the far doorway which leads to the grand staircase everyone is so intent on listening to jo that his movement attracts no
at the bottom of the service stairs in the back of the embassy drayton is standing with two men who came with him in the car
one of them holds a short length of rope in his hand
you two wait in the mail room
ill bring him down
ben mounts two stairs leading up to the grand staircase
he looks about him cautiously
at the service stairs drayton goes up two stairs and turns back to the men
he looks at his watch
i wont be a minute
he starts to move up one step
up in the room hank is bent in a chair sobbing mrs
drayton is kneeling by him trying to reassure him

she rises to her feet and as the footsteps grow and grow she looks at the boy desperately she goes to the door hears the steps coming nearer and nearer

drayton lets out a piercing scream
hanks head jerks up
the door is heard bursting open
ban stands in the doorway
he instantly rushes toward hank the camera panning him
hank leaps to his feet and the two of them come together
no clear words are spoken just muffled sounds of words as they hug each other
then they release each other and turn to look at mrs
she is standing staring at the door with horror
ben turns quickly to look
framed in the doorway is drayton
deftly he reaches into his pocket and produces a small automatic
for a moment the group stands there in silence
then ben speaks
i dont think you want to start any shooting drayton with all those people downstairs and police outside

drayton seems unperturbed by bens refusal
he leans down closer to the boy and addresses him directly
you wouldnt want your father to get hurt would you
hank looks up towards his father
drayton looks up
draytons intentions are unmistakable
ben looks down at him with a hatred that is almost ready to explode but he has sense enough to understand draytons meaning
drayton straightens up a slight smile on his face
he slips the gun into his pocket but still holds it
well go down the stairs together in a casual sort of way
then well stroll along to the nearest taxi rank
i trust there wont be any emotional outbursts
interrupting there wont be
hank dont say or do anything
hank just nods
hes too frightened to talk

drayton seems carefully alert
the camera moves downward in front of them as they descend
the music coming from the ballroom ceases as jo finishes her second song
there is the sound of great applause
the three are about a dozen steps from the bottom when suddenly ben shoots out a hard and pushes drayton forward
taken by surprise he stumbles and falls down the stairs clumsily
clutching for support with his hands the gun goes off in his pocket and he remains in a crumpled heap at the bottom of the stairs
the applause having died out the shot is heard loud and people pour out of the ballroom into the hallway
they rush for the stairway and draytons body led by the ambassador and the prime minister
