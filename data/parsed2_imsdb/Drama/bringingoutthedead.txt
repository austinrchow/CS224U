other pictures a day at the beach a young serviceman happy parents
franks mind drifts in the last year i had come to believe in such things as spirits leaving the body and not wanting to be put back spirits angry at
the awkward places death had left them
i understood how crazy it was to think this way but i was convinced if i turned around id see old man burke standing at the window watching waiting for
us to finish
frank feels burkes heart beneath cracked ribs
the eeg remains flat
its time to quit
to larry ill take over
call er and ask for an eighty three

john enters crying
mary repeats softly play the sinatra
frank notices mary for the first time blond hair dyed black cut short loose fitting tank dress black makeup running down her cheeks

larry and franks zebra ambulance lined up beside two others outside a blazing emergency sign on the crowded side street
every large city has a hospital emergency room so replete with trauma violence and suffering it picks up the sobriquet knife and gun club
on manhattans lower east side its our lady of mercy aka our lady of misery
er a white lit cement box painted yellow and decorated with old framed playbills
four rows of six plastic chairs face a tv bolted and chained to the ceiling
the seats are filled with backed up drunks assault victims and regulars bleeding and spilling over against the walls and the floor getting up to ask their status or going
out to throw up and have a smoke
larry and frank wheeling burke in two iv lines each connected to an elbow tangled in ekg cables
two lacerated russians scramble out of their way as they approach griss the large black sunglassed security guard
he looks up from his television guide hey partner
your man does not look well
theyre not gonna appreciate you inside
pumping ambu bag griss let us in
things are backing up
griss pushes a button activating the automatic door striking the bandaged leg of a man lying down on a stretcher in the hall

frank pushes the automatic door button and is suddenly hit from behind by noel
the stretcher spins sideways
noel dives out the doors for the water fountain snorting up water like a bull
mary burke standing with her family looks at frank

its not so rare
he grew up on our street
hes had a rough life and hes a little crazy from it but thats no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water
mary starts to cry
frank fumbles in his pocket finds a tissue gives it to her
my fathers dying noel

two whores stand in front of an abandoned building

noel wearing generic homeless combat fatigues muttering to his friends in hell passes on the sidewalk
frank notices another hooker catches her face the same face as the pregnant whore
the rose face
his mind drifts rose was getting closer
ever since the call a month before when id lost her she seemed like all the girls in the neighborhood
one of the first things you learn is to avoid bad memories
i used to be an expert but lately id found some holes
anything could trigger it
the last month belonged to rose but there were a hundred more ready to come out
the ems vehicle is stopped at a fast food joint
larry orders waits
these spirits were part of the job
it was impossible to pass a building that didnt bold the spirit of something the eyes of a corpse the screams of a loved one
all bodies leave their mark
you cannot be near the new dead without feeling it
larry gets his chicken chats with counter clerk returns
i could handle that
what haunted me now was more savage spirits born half finished homicides suicides overdoses innocent or not accusing me of being there witnessing a humiliation which they could never forgive
larry climbs in sets his take out on the dash hands frank a coffee
a police walkie talkie is in the front tray

zebra heads up first double caduceus symbols shining from the back of the van
inside the cab larry and frank lean out the front windows to avoid the king of stink faster
flips on top lights faster
griss holding up his hand get that stinky assed motherfucking bug ridden skell out of my face
frank and larry stand beside oh slumped in his wheelchair
fellow drunks welcome their comrade from plastic chairs
nurse constance escorts a young man from the triage area i would have to register you to give you something to eat and my conscience just will not allow that
griss the gentleman wants to leave
looks at oh he looks pale
youre not eating enough
you need more fiber
griss shows young man the door
holds up his report hes wasted
thats my diagnosis shit faced
he just needs a bath and some food
take him in back and see if you can find a stretcher
to frank shes nuts
thats why he comes here
she encourages him
griss returns as crupp calls from critical care area dont you dare
thats my last stretcher
this is not a homeless shelter
hell have to wait in the lobby
no way man
not even in the corner
griss cannot abide the funk tonight
larry and frank turn secretly pleased and wheel mr
larry setting oh outside the entrance heading towards the all night deli
frank takes out a cigarette
mary burke walks up the drive opening a pack of cigs
frank offers her a light
she inhales exhales its my first cigarette in over a year
the first is always the best
its the waiting thats killing me not knowing you know
its really hard on my mother
the doctor doesnt think my fatherll make it
he says he was dead too long after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes close the door
you never know
i mean if he was dead i could handle that
at least hes got people around him
im not so sure
my father and i havent spoken in three years
when my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack that hed locked himself in the bathroom all the way going over i was thinking how i
was gonna tell him what a bastard he was
then when i got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed i thought of all these other things i wanted to say
even when you say the things theres always more things
right now im more worried about my mother than anything
they wont let her see my father
take her home
get some rest
not going to find anything out now
thats what i told her
if she could just see him a second then i could take her home
larry walks back with a coffee for himself and a brown bag beer for frank
time to switch
i wheel you heal
the ems vehicle drives downtown
the city has transformed a deserted city inhabited by the hardcore hardcore night shift employees hardcore party goers hardcore druggies hardcore homeless people with something special to do or nowhere
david on the corner of thirty eight and two youll find a three car accident two taxis and a taxi
one two henry east two two report of a very bad smell
no further information
larry driving at a good clip riding both the gas and the break pedals enjoying the newfound freedom of movement
larry swing over on eighth
were gonna hafta run one of these calls
relax will you
frank places both hands on the dash as larry squeals around a corner
the biggest problem with not driving is that whenever theres a patient in back youre also in the back
the doors close youre trapped
four in the morning is always the worst time for me just before dawn just when youve been lulled into thinking it might be safe to close your eyes for
thats when i first found rose
larry slows down on a side street
frank turns to watch a homeless man
the man looks back its rose
the rose face
she was on the sidewalk not breathing
frank turns to larry im not feeling very well larry
i say we go back to the hospital and call it a night

larry pulls into the jacob riis projects by the river slows to a stop
larry cuts the lights not bothering to inform his partner what his partner already knows theyre taking a rest
zebra sits in the quiet dark
larry puffs a cigarette
tell me you ever think of doing anything else

after the kids are in school louise can go back to the post office and i thought what the hell ill start my own medic service
out on the island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal
its just a matter of time and who you know
someday its going to be chief larry calling the shots
larry tosses the cigarette out the window leans against the door jab closes his eyes
in a second hes asleep
frank turns down the radio volume the calls are fewer and further between now
frank leans back tries to rest id always had nightmares but now the ghosts didnt wait for me to sleep
i drank every day
help others and you help yourself that was my motto but i hadnt saved anyone in months
it seemed all my patients were dying
id waited sure the sickness would break tomorrow night the next call the feeling would drop away
more than anything else i wanted to sleep like that close my eyes and drift away
timecut radio wakes frank from his reverie

zebra coming to a bone jarring stop at the corner
getting out of the techie seat frank sees noel his face bloody charging at him
noel has sliced up a tire and fastened the pieces with string over his shoulders
tin cans circle his wrists and ankles
one hand carries a broken bottle the other a stringless violin
frank jumps back inside as noel rams the window leaving stains from his blood matted dreadlocks
larry calls for backup medics police firemen anybody

john burke sleeps slumped in one of the chairs
griss stands at his post
pulling out a pack of cigarettes frank steps outside
frank exits lights up
the sky is going blue
inside the open rear doors of zebra larry mops up bloody floor
mary burke weary steps beside frank
he offers a cigarette
she accepts you shouldnt smoke

larry jumps theatrically out of the ambulance swings the mop wildly over his head thats it

burke to zebra
mary watches as larry backs up the ems vehicle frank sitting in the back with her mother pulls into first light
larry dropping frank off at the corner of first and sixteenth driving on
it is as if the sun has risen on a different city different from the one which frank drove through the night before a city of crumbling neighborhoods laid bare
by sunlight a city of day people getting up having breakfast going to work
franks studio apartment betrays a minimal existence single bed table fridge and stove loveseat bookshelf television
the bookshelf contains a cd player medical texts old schoolbooks romantic poetry paperback novels and incongruously a picture book of womens fashion
a framed commendation from the new york fire department hangs beside and open closet of work clothes corduroy jacket two ties on a hook
remnants of a fast food breakfast on the table
aluminum foil covers the windows blocking out the sunlight
frank stands bareback at the single open window smoking drinking from a glass of whiskey looking across the gray cityscape of high rises and water tanks winding down from the
nights work saving someones life is like falling in love the best drug in the world
for days sometimes weeks afterwards you walk the street making infinite whatever you see
once for weeks i couldnt feel the earth
everything i touched became light
horns played in my shoes flowers fell from my pockets
time dissolves frank paces the room
pours himself another drink
you wonder if youve become immortal as if you saved your own life as well
what was once criminal and happenstance suddenly makes sense
god has passed through you why deny it that for a moment there god was you
time dissolve window is closed
frank tosses in his sleep
nightstand alarm buzzes
frank sits up looks at the clock
stretching his neck he walks over to the sink runs water on his hands and face
the maintenance garage and dispatch office adjacent to our lady of mercy
frank standing on one foot before the desk of captain barney ex paramedic and lifetime civil servant
good morning captain
barney looks over to miss williams his secretary seated at a desk perpendicular to his what am i going to to do with this guy

marcus flips on the lights and siren
marcus grabs the yellow airway bag leaving frank to lug the three heavier pieces as they push their way through the crowd toward a black jacketed doorman holding a walkie
talkie to crowd i hope were not late from you guys holding us up here
the doorman leads frank and marcus through the smoky graffiti covered backstage ante rooms to a cubicle where a knot of club types and band members hover around ib bangin
year old white rapper face up blank eyed and breathless on dirt impacted carpet
hip hop music echoes from the club pa
frank kneels beside ib bangin taking a pulse realizing its the gray and black stage makeup making him seem doa
he pulls up ib bangins eyelid shines a light into the pupil
okay what happened

whispers hes not dead

she broke his heart
the girlfriend shoots a look at the bystander
marcus just stands hands on hips silent
frank opens the drug box
the drummer relents all right all right hes been snorting that red death stuff

frank injects ib bangin he responds to the narcon with a jolt opening his eyes raising his hands
oh wow man

to ib bangin cmon
frank and the girlfriend guide ib bangin to the door as marcus collects the gear
the first step is love
the second is mercy
he follows frank ib bangin and girlfriend out calling for the crowd to clear
ib bangin sitting with nurse constance in triage
past griss frank talks with dr
hazmat that guy i brought in yesterday post cardiac arrest

hes showing cognitive signs
he started with spontaneous respiration now hes fighting to pull out the tube

hes in a cat scan
im giving him every test i can thromboytics steroids nitrodrips heparin

the heart refuses to stabilize hes coded eleven times since he got here
this guys a fighter
every time the valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints
the family know
i wanted to bring them in to see if hed respond to voices but they werent in the waiting room
the guys daughter was in my face all last night and when i finally have something positive to tell her shes gone
frank nods walks down skid row passing nurse constance lecturing ib bangin you put poison in your veins and now that youre breathing again you cant wait to say thank
you and go back to poison shopping
well since we saved your life maybe you could do us a favor and stop breathing in another city next time
young heading up the avenue
i ever tell you about the time years ago i was on this ledge uptown trying to talk this psycho inside
where the guy jumped and you almost fell
no you never told me that story

marcus stops the ambulance on th street
ill be right back
frank gets out walks over to the intercom pushes the button for a
mary answers yes
hello im frank pierce from the ambulance last night

mary appears in a white sweater and simple gray skirt like schoolgirls wear
the dark makeup is gone
she looks happy
hes better isnt he
well the doctor says hes showing some movement
its still early it might mean nothing but i thought youd want to know
i sensed it when i heard your voice
you look so different
its awful isnt it
night of the living cheerleaders
i think it looks good
i was going nuts in that waiting room so i came back to check on my mom
how is she
i was just going to get some food
maybe we could
you cant kill my father that easy
hell fight forever
like with me hasnt talked to me in three years
but its okay
sometimes you have to put things behind you
mary steps to the curb raises her hand for a taxi
none in sight
be tough to get a taxi here
we can give you a ride if you like
looks at him okay
frank opens the back doors of the bus climbs in behind mary
they sit on the bench opposite the stretcher
shes the daughter of a cardiac arrest i brought in last night
i told her wed give her a ride back to misery
her fathers showing signs of improving
oh frank youve got it bad so much worse than i thought
im hungry too
we gotta get some food after this
god help us hes hungry too
marcus turns on the radio an old song from the sixties as they head uptown
frank and mary walking past the triage station toward the curtained corner where her father lies
next to burke dr
hazmat assists an aids patient amid a forest of iv tubing
burke lies prone two iv lines hung from poles intubated by a hose running to the ventilator a ng tube covering his nose
his eyes are permanently half open
burkes hands and feet are tied by white nylon restraints
mary takes her fathers hand as frank pulls the curtain
dad can you hear me
beat open your eyes if you can hear me
a nearby patient screams
mary burke screams too he squeezed my hand
hazmat and milagros an intern walk over
hes moving doctor
he grabbed my hand
move your hand dad one more time
burkes hand twitches see
ill be damned
checks burkes pupils its movement but im not sure how voluntary
he hears me
open your eyes dad
burkes eyes fully open
his cheeks ripple and his lips smack against the tube between them
his back arches his body shakes his arms yank at their restraints as if reaching to pull out the wires and tubes
green lights dance across the ekg screen alarms sound first the cardiac monitor next the ventilator
nurse crupp i need ten milligrams of valium
hazmat and milagros hold down burkes arms as crupp prepares the valium
mary backs away
why dont we go outside for a little while wait until this passes
they step away
passing griss reading anti white agitprop and waiting room regulars frank leads mary to a small rectangular paramedic locker area sofa desk two banks of gray lockers walls decorated with
hospital rules and regulations
he wants to pull that tube out
its pretty painful thats why they keep him sedated but its a good sign
i know my father would hate to be tied down
he wouldnt even go to the dentist
he sits across from her wishing he could be in three seats at once each to watch her from a different angle
thats how its done
you have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own
hes better though right
reluctant hes better
look im sorry but its important to me
i mean a week ago i was wishing he was dead
and now i want hear his voice again just once more you know what i mean
marcus enters with a small pizza and two cokes
went over to sals got this
there must be some place in hell for a guy who sells a dollar fifty a slice
i call you if anything comes up
im not really hungry
she says as she picks up a slice of cheese pizza
my father was a great man you know
there was nobody he wouldnt help
you know that crazy guy noel who i gave water to last night
he lived in our house for almost a year
a total stranger hed do anything for his own family though
its best not to
off her look its good pizza huh
not as good as ninos
you remember that pizza place joes on tenth street maybe fifteen years ago
when you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle
yeah or saint anthony
you from the neighborhood
i grew up on elizabeth
i went to blessed sacrament
i went to holy name
whered you go to high school
we moved out after that
like everybody else except us
always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks
your parents theyre fine
my old man was a bus driver mom a nurse i was sort of born to it i guess
beat its hard to explain
she had a hard time adjusting to well maybe it was my fault too
this thought hangs in the air
from outside a bellicose drunk is escorted into the er
get your ow
is it always this bad in here
i mean how does anyone survive
its been bad lately but its always bad
how long you been doing this
wow you musta seen some things huh
whats the worst thing you ever seen
you learn to sort of block it out you know like cops fence off a crime scene
but then something good will happen and everything will just glow
you must get a lot of overdoses
i bet you picked me up a couple of times
i think id remember that
i was a different person then
does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this
it must be my face
my mother always said i looked like a priest
wipes her mouth i better go check on my father
thanks for the pizza
i owe you one
maybe when he gets better you know when were done with all this
frank puts his hand out but shes already on her feet
he grabs the last slice of pizza hands it to griss as she heads back to critical care
look after her griss okay
young back on the job moving with traffic
rule number one dont get involved with patients
rule number two dont get involved with patients daughters
what about rule number three dont get involved with dispatchers named love
you dont know the first thing about rule number three cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule
come on lets go look at some hookers
the kit kat will be letting out
relevant to nothing dont ever call a junkie whore a crackhead
they get real mad
marcus swings up first ave look at these women
you cant even tell whos a hooker anymore
whatever happened to go go boots and hot pants
they wear anything now walk outta the house with whatever they got on
frank watches night tableaus police cars flashing lovers kissing woman crying hysterically drunken slugfest as his mind wanders the street is so much more unpredictable than the er and to
prepare for the unexpected i was taught to act without thinking like an army private who can take apart and reassemble a gun blindfolded
frank notices another ems bus tom walls wheeling a stretcher noel face bloodied lies restrained as walls partner opens the rear doors
i realized that my training was useful in less than ten percent of the calls and saving someones life was rarer than that
as the years went by i grew to understand that my role was less about saving lives than about bearing witness
i was a grief mop and much of my job was to remove if even for a short time the grief starter or the grief product
it was enough i simply showed up
marcus continues as if uninterrupted look at her
leaves you no idea whats underneath not even a suggestion
could be a skeleton for all you know
they pass a working girl in a rain slicker who pulls off her hood to look at them a familiar face
nice though pulling back her hood as we drive by
theres a mystery to it then she shows you
shes no whore marcus
were all whores frank
you know what im talking about the way she looked at me
she wasnt looking at you man she was looking at me
frank looking back at the rose face hears her faintly say why did you kill me frank
i didnt kill you
marcus not hearing roses voice replies no you didnt frank thank you
but theres still a couple hours left on the shift
i need a drink thats all
dispatcher loves voice cuts through twelve young answer the radio

marcus is taking him and the mother to maternity
across the room an obscenity spouting female crackhead being restrained by a patrolman and hospital security adding to the sense of emergency and chaos
mishra pediatric md and nurses squeeze toward newborn edging frank back
mishra takes an osteocatheter out of the cart forces it into the now obscured baby as nurse constance massages the infants chest
hazmat steps over to the now restrained crackhead
im a mother
i got a daughter

mishra worried checks with nurse constance theyre losing the newborn status
i think theres a pulse
frank looking at the ekg monitor a green flatline backs away
frank walking away not looking where hes going backs into noels gurney
excuse me sir excuse me i would please trouble you for one cup of water
the smallest thing in the world to ask for water
a man is dying and that is me
noel his face battered from his encounter with walls pulls at his restraints howls for days ive eaten nothing but sand o lord i waited so long
hazmat looks over christ

young on the road again sky turning blue

marcus reaches under the seat pulls a pint of vodka a quart of orange juice and two cups out of an old gym bag passes them to frank
the bar is now open
frank mixes a screwdriver for marcus straight vodka for himself
i hate vodka

marcus hits the sirens and lights accelerates to full speed
the vodka spills frank grabs the dash
im coming love
marcus swings the bus wildly to avoid a cab skids into a turn and smack toward a parked truck
frank covers his face and screams
the back of the ambulance rams into the truck the rear windows shatter
frank looks around realizes no one is hurt
he climbs out where you going
you cant leave me now
frank walks up avenue a leaving marcus and the disabled vehicle
the first rays of sun strike the buildings ahead
frank turning the corner checking his watch about to enter the dark bar across the corner from the hospital watching noel run past him and away skipping from one foot
to the other
so long noel
the emergency doors open mary burke head down looking neither direction walks away from frank
griss steps out after her
frank joins him whats going on griss
your friend there just untied the water beggar
griss was coming out to thank her
probably saved griss a murder charge
about mary having a tough time of it
mary starts to run
she pushes her way through a group of high schoolers frank does likewise keeping his distance
five blocks later mary hesitates at a plaza outside the stuyvesant town projects frank stops a few steps away from mary mary turns
you seemed like you were in trouble
steps over im all right
i just cant stand to see people tied up
im in the waiting room for hours listening to noel screaming
the only reason hes screaming is cause hes tied up
dont seem so bad to me

i wanted to cut my father loose too
they told me he almost died and five minutes later they say hes better and i go in
its killing me seeing him fighting like that
gazes up building look since youre here maybe you could do me a favor
i need you to wait for me outside this building okay

mary takes a few steps turns back

that way shell let me go

she walks into the building
the dinged metal doors shudder shut as frank follows mary into the graffittied elevator
it jumps three feet upwards stops then continues metal scraping concrete at each passing floor
i shouldnt have asked you to come
you asked me not to come
promise you wont go inside
i just have to relax a little
not feel so guilty all the time
we can still go back
ill walk you home
you sleep a couple of hours watch some tv take a bath

if you have any doubts about this its my fault
the elevator jerks to a stop the doors open
mary turns to frank you go on home okay
im fine really
i dont need you
mary pushes the bell at m
kanita wearing a paisley robe opens the doors and says hey cy guess whos here
the elevator doors close on frank
frank paces past the sleeping security guard checks his watch
he presses the elevator button
the door to m opens can i help you
shes a friend
shes not here
frank pushes past her
wait a minute
you cant go in
cy coates light skinned black stands in the smoky room
dark curtained windows block the sunlight a dirty fish tank casts a green glow across the beat up furniture
a large framed photo of a volcano hangs over the couch
its okay kanita
come on in
he looks like a cop
hes not a cop hes a medic
extends hand im cy coates
mary said you might be coming
where is she
sleeping in the back
she asked me to pick her up
i know but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours
terrible about her father isnt it
i better just go in and see her
kanita sits on the sofa next to an unshaven sleeping man
coates gestures i call this the oasis
refuge from the world out there
did you know two people were shot in this building last week
frank heads down the hall toward the rear of the apartment coates follows
they pass an open door where inside tiger a fat man with dried blood running down the corner of his mouth sits punching computer keys at a desk
thats the tiger
the ladys down the hall
welcome to sunrise enterprises frank the stress free factory
in the next room mary lies on a mattress on the floor yellow sheet pulled up to her neck
frank leans over her mary
mary weve got to get going
groggy no no
she wanted something to help her sleep
mary we really have to go
mary blindly swings her fist at him collapses unconscious back to the mattress
frank shes suffered enough
shes okay i promise

coates escorts frank back to the living room
im always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as i can imagine
here sit down

cy sits across from him pulls out a pin sized joint lights it that shit is poison frank
we dont drink alcohol here

frank hesitates why do you think im telling you this frank for my health
you ought to look at yourself in the mirror man
kanita get him a glass of water
frank watches as kanita gets up walks to the kitchen
coates places the pill in his hand
is this what you gave mary
thats the stuff
i call it the red lion
very king of the jungle
no language only brute power
you cant believe how relaxing it is
kanita returns with a glass of water gives it to frank coates stands feeds the fish
frank im trying to help you
frank swallows the white pill drinks the water
he places his arms on the chair i guess ill be going
just take it easy
frank looks around the smoke filled room
kanita walks over extends her hand
take my pulse
he does its good isnt it
i knew it
i was wrong about you
youre not so bad
kanita runs her hand across his shoulders
frank starts to nod
the room getting warm and dark
his eyelids lower sleep precious sleep
voices and sounds echo through the purple haze as franks mind drifts in time and space
action and sounds slow speed up distort intermix with the oasis as frank goes back this is how it begins the last time the first time
larry exits zebra as rose wearing a yellow rain slicker falls to her knees in the miasmic dream stank onto the sidewalk then onto her back
from forty feet away frank seeing her reach for a parking meter grabbing the tube kit running
rose gasping for breath frank falling to his knees lifting her tongue prying her teeth apart slipping the blade between her lips rose not breathing waiting for her to inhale
shooting the tube down her vocal cords
larry listening to lung sounds belly sounds youre in the stomach
youre in the stomach man
frank pulling the tube out trying again
somewhere cy coates laughs
youre in the stomach
let me try
one more time
rose going blue pulse rate dropping ekg slowing jim morrison singing
larry ripping the tube from franks hands taking over pushing frank aside trying cpr intubating rose air moving into her lungs it doesnt matter
rose is gone
frank hears a scream its his own voice
frank standing screaming in the living room
cy walking over kanita standing the sleeping man awaking
frank take it easy
he flipped out
frank bends over in pain
be cool man
youre having a paradoxical reaction
it can happen
to kanita didnt i tell you this guy was stressed out
frank heads to where mary sleeps
frank where you going
in the back bedroom frank picks up mary hoists her over his shoulder fireman style and heads out
youre making a mistake
sit down and relax a minute
frank opens the front door no one stops him exits
calling shell be back
and by the way you owe me ten bucks
the elevator doors open
frank sets mary on her feet
i can walk
she says weaving out of the front doors
mary walks a few steps into the plaza stumbles frank catches her
let go of me
he relaxes you shouldnt have come up
i told you not to
you could have gotten us both killed
mary heads up the avenue past baby strollers postal workers deliverymen
you and cy have a nice talk
he tell you about sunrise enterprises helping people
well ive seen him hurt people
why are you following me
because you can barely walk
frank walking slightly beside and behind lights a cigarette
you remember noel from the other night how noel is now
he wasnt always like that
he was my brothers best friend
cy or tiger or one of those other goons put a bullet in noels head
he was in a coma three months
crazy ever since
they stop at a three story brick apartment building
this is my place
she unlocks the door
he follows her in
mary grabs the railing heads up the stairs
what is it
you want to help me you feel sorry for me
keep it to yourself
i need to sit down a minute
or maybe you wanna fuck me
everyone else has
mary opens the door to her first floor apartment frank follows
the room is clean and feminine
unframed water colors stacked against the wall atop a desk
a black lab greets mary she pets him
frank slumps on the sofa
ive been clean two years now
i got a job
i paint when im home
dont bother anybody
then all this shit happens
frank keels over onto his side his head hitting a cushion eyes closed dog licking his cheek
oh no you dont
you cant stay here
hes asleep the sound of her crying fading in his head
fade in a passing siren wakes frank
he thinks back looking around the darkened room realizes where he is
the dog comes over licks his hand
hello im frank
a very close friend who loves animals
he removes the blanket mary has laid over him stands hello
frank walks cautiously through the dark finds a bathroom lit by a glowing mickey mouse switch
he flips on the switch a string of green and red christmas lights glow
three types of soap sit on the sink
he turns on the faucet i washed my face with three kinds of soap each smelling like a different season
it felt good to be in a womans room again especially a woman who wasnt comatose or severely disabled
i felt that perhaps i had turned a corner like i saved someone though i didnt know who
frank standing at captain barneys desk

frank walks toward sixteen xray as walls gets out of the front seat
the ems vehicle is dented and rusted a relic of wars and a hodgepodge of parts
frank what do you know

i have tried to kill him and he will not die

frank makes a be right back gesture walks into er
saturday night at the knife and gun club the joint is hopping the sound system blaring
frank passing griss holding back an angry hispanic man with a bleeding arm dont make me take off my sunglasses

frank walks over to unit three mr
burkes cubicle pulls back the curtain
burke lies sedated wired and tubed
frank leans over feels burkes pulse
franks expression changes he looks at the ekg monitor green lines seem to be at war normal beats marching in formation against wild looking rhythms the heart working hard and
not getting much done
burkes face twitches
burkes voice speaks in franks head go to the bank boy take out everything you can
frank turns up the ekg amplitude mr
ive had enough
the alarms start to ring ekg first followed by the bells off the oxygen saturation monitor and low drone of ventilator
intern milagros pulling open the curtain behind frank shaking her head reaching for the defribilator paddles handing them to frank
he steps back you do it

frank shocks burke his body convulses
the heartbeats on monitor return to regular formation

frank despondent not listening walks away
xray driving past a strip of night clubs and restaurants the sidewalks full of young people laughing jostling embracing
in addition to the ems two way and am radio walls keeps a police band walkie talkie open

walls takes off after noel
frank taking out his flashlight enters second alley walks down dark stairs which hopefully circle around to noel
mini flashlight leading the way frank steps gingerly down the refuse strewn alley
he kicks something thinking its trash looks down a body rustles pair of sleeping eyes look up

shadows flash in the distance
he hears a woman crying shoots his flashlight her direction nothing
frank hears the voice again roses voice why did you kill me frank

frank stands back watching walls and noel like some static black and white tv screen from his childhood
noel trying to protect himself cries out
swinging bat to the moon alice

frank nods walks out
behind walls helps hazmat and crupp place noel on a bed
frank pierce walks down the hospital corridor steps into room
burke lies tubed wired and tied to life support
blue light comes through the window
on the ekg monitor a slow steady green endless line up down
frank takes a moment exhales
one by one frank flips off the machines
the clanging ekg alarm is followed by the bass honking of the respirator alarm and two tweetering iv drip alarms
frank holding burkes pulse watches the life go out of him
hearing commotion outside frank flips the machines back on the ekg monitor is flatline
a floor nurse rushes in feels for burkes pulse
calling out code
frank steps back as the nurse hits the emergency switch

hazmat out of breath enters he coded
christ what a way to start the day
hes in v fib
frank pulls out the paddles applies them to burkes chest clear
frank knowing its futile shocks burke no result
zap him again
frank goes through the motions pretending to shock burke
the flatline doesnt waver
get the cart start compressions get an epinephrine in
frank backs out the door as a nurse and intern enter
in the corridor frank listens as the activity becomes less urgent
hazmat steps out thats enough
i called it
lets get some coffee
to frank you gonna tell the family
frank walks out of our lady of mercy heads down the side street
he passes tom walls wielding a giant flashlight smashing sixteen xrays headlights denting the hood and side windows
frank rings the buzzer
mary sleepy voiced answers who is it

mary wearing a burgundy robe opens the door
frank says nothing
her expression darkens
frank looks at her again its not mary its rose
mary has roses face
hes dead rose

how can that be
he was getting better
they shocked him one too many times
he was tough
you did all you could
you have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own
would you like to come in
rose mary opens the door wider closes it behind frank
rose is mary again she and frank lie clothed on her bed
he leans his head against her breast as she holds him
his eyes close sleep
