screenplay by j
mackye gruber eric bress evan good looking but with dark haunted eyes frantically hides himself in an unlit doctors office
his face and chest are covered in blood
he holds his forehead in pain
flashlight beams stab through the darkened corridor hunting for him
guards are heard shouting to each other
evan grabs a cardboard box and hides under a doctors desk
he grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand
as he writes if anyone finds this then i guess my plan didnt work and im already dead
he takes a deep breath
but if i can just go back to the beginning of all this i still might be able to save her
fatigue overwhelms him but he continues writing
andrea treborn twenty five an attractive pregnant woman strapped to a gurney is rolled down a busy hospital corridor
she is clearly ready to give birth and as she flails her arms she knocks another patients iv bottle into the wall
a tearful andrea holds newborn evan in her hands
smiling andrea holds baby evan up to the camera then places him in a crib
evans father jason puts a year old on a slide
a birthday party for lenny a chubby kid with only a few friends
evan now is gently prodded by andrea toward kayleigh a quiet sweet looking girl with beautiful hair
evan clumsily shakes her hand and she quickly leans over and kisses his cheek
he blushes and runs to hug his mothers leg
in the driveway year old evan plays with crickett a frisky cocker spaniel puppy
andrea wearing a mechanics jumpsuit works impatiently on the carburetor of a toyota celica
evan pets the dog as he watches his mother work
evan quickly eyes the situation and grabs the wrench from the toolbox
were gonna be late again
when did you ever care about getting to school on time
were putting up pictures for parents night
evan impatiently watches andrea turn the bolt
righty tighty lefty lucy
dont worry evan youll have plenty of time
the carburetor will not set properly
she bangs on it with the wrench
re carb darn it
can dad come this time
getting impatient you know the answer to that
cant he come out for one day
weve been over this a hundred times
its too dangerous for him
but lenny said that his dads coming
and tommy and kayleighs dad
andrea hands the wrench to evan
finish this up for me
evan beams as he climbs onto the bumper and screws the carb back together
andrea meanwhile strips off her coveralls revealing a spotless nurses uniform underneath
all the dads are gonna be there
i get the point kiddo
but im not so bad am i
because ive been waiting to see your art projects all week and id feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there
evan disappointed passes the wrench back to andrea
andrea gets behind the wheel
she turns the ignition and the engine roars to life
evan wears a proud smile
youre amazing kiddo
andrea races through the school zone and heads for the main doors
evans already got the car door open and his foot on the ground by the time the car skids to a halt
andrea checks her watch
okay have a great day i love you ill pick you up later gotta go
evan blows andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school
as andrea pulls away mrs
boswell taps the car window
i need to speak with you
im sorry but can it wait til tonight
im already late for work mrs
boswells morbid expression stops andrea
i think you really need to see this
the classroom is filled with screaming running children
boswell enters the classroom with andrea and immediately calls out to tommy a tough seven year old kid who swings a whiffle bat at lenny now seven a sniffling chubby
evan is surprised to see his mother enter with mrs
boswell but continues playing with kayleigh now seven a quiet sweet looking girl
boswell leads andrea over to the teachers desk
i was going to show this to the principal but i wanted to talk to you first
what is it
yesterday i had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up
most of them made drawings of what their parents did but this
boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls out a drawing
andrea turns to stone when she sees it
i dont understand
evan did this
the drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while standing on a heap of dead bodies
its extremely sophisticated for a seven year old
some of the corpses have been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically correct
andrea sees evan playing with lenny harmless as a bunny and struggles to control her concern
thank you for showing it to me first
ill take care of it
can i have the picture
there is one more thing mrs
and i feel bad for mentioning it
when i asked evan about his drawing well he didnt remember doing it
andrea is visibly shaken now
i have to go
andrea seems so impacted by this revelation that she cannot even start the car
the children hang artwork on the walls in prep for parents night
each child has a picture of his or her family made from colored construction paper and macaroni
evans picture no longer sophisticated depicts his mother crockett and himself on a green hill
tommy and kayleighs pictures each show two kids and a single father
and their mother is stuck to the far end of page
lenny beams as he pins up his picture of an ideal nuclear family
he looks at tommys picture and is confused
you put the mommy too far away
boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it
youre such a retard
mommy lives far away but she comes and visits
to tommy if im retarded why didnt my mommy move away from me
tommy gets upset
he swipes his hand down lennys picture and his macaroni mother crumbles to the floor
lenny begins to cry
hey whatd you do that for
fat little baby crying for mommy
evan takes the ruined picture and leans down next to lenny
come on lenny
its not that bad
you can still see your mom a little
lenny unable to stop crying begins hyperventilating out of control
his desperate gasps for breath are frightening
evan scared looks around for mrs
boswell but cannot find her
he reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears his own macaroni mother apart and places it over lennys picture
its a nuclear family again
lenny slowly is able to catch his breath
can i have this
i was gonna make a new one anyway
kayleigh helps lenny glue a new mother in place and she smiles gratefully at evan
as evan smiles back at kayleigh mrs
boswell calmly enters the room in time to see evan tacking up his butchered family portrait
andrea runs up the stairs
harlon redfield a handsome and extremely genial man scrutinizes a disturbing drawing
and you say he doesnt remember any of it
anxious not according to his teacher
it just got me thinking about jason and what if evans inherited his fathers condition
hold it hold it andrea
lets not jump to conclusions
ill run some preliminary tests see what we can rule out
andrea nods and forces a thankful smile
tell you what bring evan here tonight and well run a cat scan series
the looming building looks even more frightening at night
andrea and evan head up the stairs
i dont like this place mom
please can we go
i promise i wont make any more bad pictures
lighthearted youll be fine
redfield just wants to give you some tests
youll like him
andrea leads evan into dr
redfield warmly greets evan at the door
its very nice to meet you
to andrea hes as handsome as his father
stunned you know my father
redfield can answer andrea cuts him off
thats why i wanted you to come here evan
redfield already has a background in memory loss
my father has a bad memory too
off andreas look uh tell you what evan
if its okay with your mother id like to run some tests
evan raises an eyebrow at the doctor
okay it might be a little scary
evan looks terrified as he lies on a medical platform as a series of cat scan images are taken
in another part of the room a distressed andrea speaks quietly with dr
just tell me that evan doesnt have jasons illness
look andrea im sure hell test negative for brain disorders
but theres something else you can try to monitor his memory
just have him write down everything he does
it could be extremely useful to jog his memory
see if he remembers anything new the next day
and ill have the test results back in a few days
the next morning
evan busily writes in his new black marble mead comp book today mommy is taking me to play with kayley and tommy
i will mete there father and see what a real dad is like
maybe one day i will mete my dad
andrea meanwhile speaks into the phone as she pours lucky charms into a cereal bowl for evan
i really appreciate you watching him he wont be any trouble at all
evan puts down the journal and eats breakfast
he separates the green clovers from the cereal and drops them to the floor for crockett to nibble
thesell bring you luck crockett
into phone great
ill see you soon
andrea hangs up the phone and walks into the next room
andrea grabs the pocket book off the coffee table and heads back into the kitchen
she drops her purse in shock when she sees evan in doorway expressionless and holding a large butcher knife by his side
evan sees her but remains expressionless
what are you doing with that knife
life suddenly springs into evans face
he seems stunned to find himself holding the knife and drops it
scared what happened
what were you doing with that
tears welling i
i dont remember
andrea still shaken drops evan off at the house of george miller a handsome athletic man with an infectious smile
he approaches the car and opens the door for evan
to evan hello little man
andrea writes nervously on a piece of paper as evan gets out
thanks a lot george
heres my work number in case there are any problems
lighthearted laughter whaddaya kidding
were going to have a great time today right evan
andrea nods thanks and nervously drives away
evan walks up to mr
miller and momentarily reaches for his hand
miller flinches his hand away and chuckles at evan
you waiting for an invitation
the kids are inside
evan appears confused for a moment at mr
millers unexpected rudeness but walks inside
evan enters the well kept middle class home and sees his classmates kayleigh and tommy
kayleigh is dressed in a make shift medieval gown and tommy is also dressed in a period costume
excited to see evan evan guess what
dad got a new video camera and were all gonna be in a movie
i dont think evan gets to be in it quit it tommy
evan gets to be robin hood
im gonna be maid marian and youre the sheriff of nottingham
i thought i was the bad guy
you are silly
hes a bad sheriff
miller holding a full glass of scotch in one hand sets the circa s bulky video camera on a tripod and plugs it into the porta deck
were really gonna be in a movie
thats right evan and you get to be the star
i thought i was the star
shut up moron
now get in your costume evan
and you have to promise your bestest super duper promise that this will be our little secret
think you can do that
evan nods and sticks his arms straight up in the air
miller downs his drink and helps evan off with his clothes
suddenly evan comes to in an unfamiliar place
the rec room basement
evans eyes dart from the fireplace to mr
millers camera lens and finally to kayleigh whose ashen face trembles slightly
panic spreads across evans face
where am i
where did we all go
calm down kid
evan backs up and awkwardly scurries around the basement grabbing his clothes
i was just somewhere else how did i get here
quit acting like some retard or ill call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit youve been
kayleighs eyes are unable to leave the floor
she begins adjusting her disheveled clothing
whats wrong with me
tommy silently watches from the top of the basement stairs absently wringing the head off one of his sisters dolls
redfield places evans cat scan slides on the light box
andrea squints unable to interpret them
well the good news is that the results are negative
ive found no evidence in the way of lesions hemorrhaging tumors
and the bad news
unfortunately weve got nothing to work with
its harder playing detective now
but you must have something to go on
if i had to guess id say the blackouts are stress related
but hes seven
what kind of stress can he have
maybe hes got severe coping problems about not having a father
did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friends dad
come on i doubt the answers that simple
youd be surprised how often they are
well he has been pushing me to meet his father but ive been putting it off
its worth a shot
i can arrange a controlled meeting
a careful dose of sedatives for jason some security you and i monitoring
evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck no more missing father complex
evan dressed in his sunday best writes copiously in a journal marked age
today i get to mete my father
his name is jason and he is crazy
i hope he lets me call him dad
andrea tightly grips evans hand as the pair follow dr
redfield down a corridor
evans enthusiasm is dampened by the sounds of distant screams and bloodcurdling laughter
dad lives here
not in this wing actually
now your father may seem sleepy to you but thats just because of his medicine okay
they walk to the end of the corridor and come to a visitors chamber
redfield leads evan inside
andrea begins to follow but the doctor gestures that she stay outside
evan takes a seat at a long rectangular table
his eyes are fixated on the door on the other side of the room
finally a dark figure can be seen through the opaque glass
jason thirty and haggard looking enters the room
his eyes want to sparkle at seeing his son for the first time
but tranquilizers have dulled the effect
evans eyes fixate on the leg restraints and handcuffs that hinder jasons movement
finally jason sits
he smiles warmly and speaks in over enunciated tones
i wont bite
youve seen pictures of me right
mom says i have your eyes and your evan comes to in another unfamiliar place
rather than seeing his father across a table hes looking up at a ceiling
blocking his view of the ceiling is jason whose face is now monstrous with rage and whose cuffed hands are wrapped around evans throat choking the life out of him
through clenched teeth i
suddenly orderlies tackle jason from both sides and wedge a baton under his jaw to wrench him away
andrea frantically struggles to rescue evan from jasons clutches
panicking he has to die
you dont understand
its the only way to stop it
jason wrestles the baton from under his chin hits an orderly in the kneecap and comes for evan with the baton
orderly acts quickly beating jason with his baton
as jason makes another desperate grab for evan orderly is forced to bash him in the skull
down for the count
andrea hugs evan now in shock
im sorry evan
and alarm sounds and andrea tries to cover evans eyes but through her fingers he can see a quick blur of a pool of blood spreading from jasons head
dressed in black andrea and evan watch jasons casket being lowered into the ground
andreas tears soak through her veil
a few feet back kayleigh stands behind evan
ashes to ashes
dust to dust
evan watches the coffin descend disappearing from sight
kayleigh steps up to evan and takes his hand
and she softly whispers in evans ear
youre better off anyway
a rumble of thunder
evan looks up at the brooding dark clouds
andrea drives the children home
evan stares at the passing tombstones that flutter by like a white picket fence
the flickering strobe effect that intensifies into a white blur is hypnotic
bright and sunny
the lawn freshly cut
a toro lawnmower has been carelessly left in the grass strewn driveway
crane down to the window of the evan kayleigh tommy and lenny are now thirteen
evan exhales cigarette smoke taps his ash and finishes sketching a portrait of kayleigh in his journal
tommy wears a leather jacket and now has traces of peach fuzz on his upper lip
kayleighs hair is longer now albeit stringy and unkempt
evan closes his journal and coolly ignites a strike anywhere match with his thumb and lights kayleighs cigarette
everyone but lenny smokes in the basement
tommy now with longer hair ransacks his fathers army locker looking for something
tommy im bored shitless over here
whats up already
hold your horses man
its here somewhere
i saw it when i was a kid
tommy absently chucks an old playboy toward lenny
kayleigh seems uncomfortable by the sight of it
to tommy we should go soon
if dad catches us smoking down here were dead
so lets go
this place creeps me out
evan claps his hands and stands up lenny and kayleigh join him
finally tommy shakes an old army thermos and hears something rattling inside
i knew it had something to do with the army
tommy opens the thermos tips it over and a blockbuster stick of dynamite spills out
tommy grins mischievously
lets blow the shit out of something
tommy leads evan kayleigh and lenny on a mission through the woods
everyone smokes except lenny yet hes the only one whos wheezing
he pulls out an inhaler and takes a puff
guys slow up would you
evan did i tell you
my mother said i might be able to visit her this summer in orlando with her new family
what did i say about mentioning that bitch
uncomfortable where the hell are you taking us anyway
just blow something up already
just blow something up
are you nuts
theres an art to mass destruction
would you just paint the mona lisa
besides were here already
now at the edge of the woods tommy spots a mailbox sits at the end of the driveway
an exact replica of a colonial home it serves
across the street tommy hands the blockbuster to lenny
here you go buddy
no frigging way man
im not touching that thing
the hell you arent
anyone of us does it youll puss out and narc for sure
aint gonna work this time buddy
look how small that fuse is
ill get killed
all eyes turn to evan as he takes his lit cigarette breaks off the filter and jams the fuse into the unlit end
that should buy you ten minutes at least
gee thanks friend
lenny paces back and forth next to the three story mailbox desperately trying to appear nonchalant
he pretends to notice his shoes untied and bends down to tie it
from the woods the other kids watch anxiously
oh for christs sake just do it lenny
finally lenny throws the bomb in the mailbox
then sprints like hell to the woods
kayleigh shakes lennys inhaler and hands it to him when he gets back
taking puff thanks
evan pats lenny on the back
you got balls man
the four watch the mailbox in intense anticipation
evan smiles with the cigarette pressed tightly between his lips and places his hands over kayleighs ears
she smiles back at him and presses his hands against her head
tommy catches this and seems disturbed and quickly turns back to the mailbox
its like a staring contest
evan running full speed comes to in an unfamiliar place
he instantly loses his footing and falls to the ground
lenny falling on top of him
get him up evan
frantic what happened
where are we
evan gets up and starts running then realizes hes not being followed
kayleigh and tommy are helping lenny up and carrying him
evan realizes that lennys completely dazed
evan doubles back grabs lennys arm and he and tommy drag lenny through the woods as fast as they can
crying oh god
what did we do
whats happened to you
weve gotta get help
andreas car screeches to the curb of lennys house
lennys mother mrs
kagan frantically loads lenny into an ambulance
as andrea rushes up to the ambulance mrs
kagan gives her an icy glare and slams the ambulance door in andreas face
andrea turns to evan now trembling on the front stoop
what is it
staring menacingly at the others we were just building a fort in the woods when lenny freaked out
one minute he was fine then he just froze up
what happened evan
i dont know
i dont remember
something mustve happened
what set him off
i blacked out
building frustration dont try to use your blackouts to get out of this one
evan looks helpless
youre not making this up are you
evan shakes his head no
evan lies on a couch
with every breath you exhale you can feel all of the tension draining from your body like water through a faucet
nine ten and youre completely asleep
evan breathes slowly
andrea watches nervously from the far side of the room
now i want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with lenny
think of it like a movie
you can pause rewind or slow down any details you wish
where are you now
im standing next to kayleigh my hands are over her ears
are you hurting her
no protecting her
andrea suppresses the tiniest of proud smiles
then go a little forward in time
what do you see now
i see a car
evans eyes suddenly roll back in his head
yes tell me about the car
evan moans and begins shaking
nothing can hurt you
remember this is only a movie
youre completely safe
moaning i cant
the car vanishes and all of a sudden im on the ground in the woods
the car doesnt vanish evan
the movie in your head has broken thats all
but now ive re spliced it and i want you to tell me about the car
evan moans and shakes on the couch
fight it evan
blood begins to trickle from evans nose as a guttural sound is uttered from deep within him
redfield bolts upright in his chair and redirects the session
listen to my voice
on the count of ten youre going to wake up
feeling refreshed and remembering everything we talked about
evan moans in agony
andrea darts into the room
whats happening to him
make it stop
redfield waves her away and concentrates on evan
youre feeling more awake now
two your eyes no longer feel heavy
andrea moves to stop the blood flowing from evans nose
she lifts evans eyelids and sees only the whites of his eyes
refreshed and awake
come on evan wake up dammit
evan is completely non responsive
evan wake up oh please wake up
and youre awake
open your eyes dammit
nothing but moans and blood
redfield frantically opens some desk drawers until he finds smelling salts
he breaks a small capsule under evans mouth pinches his bleeding nose closed and lets evan inhale the vapor through his mouth
evan lurches forward on the couch and falls off
holding his bloody nose
did it work
evan deduces the answer from everyones horrified faces
andrea drops off evan kayleigh and tommy outside the complex
kayleigh looking morose shuts the car door and andrea drives off
they walk through the parking lot
to kayleigh wipe that sad assed look off your face before you get us all busted
you see the way evans mom was looking at you
would someone just tell me already what the hell happened in the mailbox
on mailbox tommy suddenly grabs evans jacket and shoves him against a parked car
tommy looks around to make sure nobody heard anything
dont ever bring that shit up again
not to me not to kayleigh or even lenny
the stupid fuck if he ever learns to talk again
evan nods scared
tommy gives a final shove
re kayleigh she dont want to talk about it anyway
do you kayleigh
kayleigh clearly doesnt
kayleigh shuffles behind evan and tommy as they head toward the theatre
evan drops back
are you okay
kayleigh says nothing as tommy sees the theatre playing seven and whispers
there it is
andrea does the dishes as the tv plays a newscast in the b
on tv was the grizzly aftermath of what police officials of upstate new york are calling a horrible act of vandalism gone awry
andrea turns to the tv blocking our view
we can only hear the report as she watches intensely
the powerful explosion is believed to have been caused by a small quantity of dynamite
andreas face looks haunted by the on screen images
she shakes her head in terror and grabs the remote
police thus far have no leads as to the suspects
she clicks off the tv trembling
the movies in progress
evan and kayleigh sit behind tommy
look at that fat fuck
youd have to wipe his ass with a forklift
some crowd members turn around and give tommy a shush
tommy whips m ms at them
shut up faggot
no ones talking to you
kayleigh repulsed suddenly darts from the aisle and runs out
evan follows her to a small alcove
im sorry kayleigh
this was a bad idea
you really dont remember anything that happened
evan shakes his head no
she looks devastated
youre so lucky
she begins to cry
evan makes sure no ones staring
its going to be okay
lennyll be fine
he reaches to comfort her
but she winces
she pulls her sleeve up revealing a large bruise
its not your fault
kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to lenny
your dad did this
kayleigh pulls back her shirt collar to show an even larger darker bruise
looking down i deserve a lot worse
what are you talking about
what you deserve is a better brother and father
all they do is make you feel like shit
she looks into his eyes
you really have no clue how beautiful you are do you
she searches his eyes for sincerity
and finds it
they lean into each other for a tender kiss
after a moment a roar from nearby
what the fuck are you doing
they jerk back to see tommy shocked and betrayed staring at them from across a small crowd
by now some teens chuckle at tommy
buying popcorn what the fuck are you doing
tommy rushes through the small crowd at evan
his hands in fists
suddenly a foot reaches out and trips tommy
tommy falls to the floor and the crowd cackles at him
tommy slowly gets up locks eyes with evan
evan looks guilty weakly shaking his head its not what youre thinking
tommy suddenly lunges at the teen punk who must be at least a foot taller than he is
tommy lands a flurry of punches before the teen punk can even defend himself frequently taking opportunities to eyeball evan
evan kayleigh and even the punks friends look on helplessly when two security guards seize tommy
tommy valiantly struggles against them at first
but the moment he realizes its hopeless he allows his body to go slack
as tommy is being dragged away he turns to evan a sick smile on his face
evan and kayleigh look back speechless
andrea drives through the winding roads
reveal shes driving evan and kayleigh home
evans up front and kayleigh sits behind them
andrea stares through the rearview mirror into kayleighs eyes
so how was the movie
andrea watches kayleigh
a calculated beat
any exploding mailboxes
kayleigh flinches at the question
and andrea catches it
evan cant help but look back at kayleigh
oh my god she knows
faking poorly what do you mean
andrea pulls the car over and stops
after a moment kayleigh realizes shes at her house
she exits the car in a hurry
andrea stares at evan who keeps his eyes facing dead ahead
she finally shifts the car into gear
evan says nothing
a for sale sign is now planted on the front lawn
andrea in her nurse uniform exits the house to her car
evan discreetly watches her leave through the window
grabs his coat and exits frame
kayleigh and evan walk down toward the house
i cant believe tommys still pissed at me
he knows im moving away right
hes been acting real strange lately
he wont even look me in the eyes anymore
duck here they come
as a station wagon rolls up the street evan and kayleigh duck in nearby bushes
did your mom say if lenny was
he must be
theyre letting him go right
the station wagon finally heads into the driveway
evan puts on a smile and charges the car pounding the window
welcome home lenny
inside the car lenny jerks back in horror
kagan looks angry as she rolls the window down
i think your little homecomings in bad taste
the smile fades from evans face
kayleigh hangs back
acidic lennys been through a hell of an ordeal no thanks to you
evan and kayleigh look guilty as the garage door opens up and mrs
kagan continues into the garage
alone lenny concentrates on a model airplane
there is a sudden knock at the window
lennys head jerks around to see evan and kayleigh smiling through the window
evan and kayleigh stand on the ivy covered trellis
quietly welcome home
thought you might like some fresh air for a change
lenny twitches ever so slightly
is tommy with you guys
evan shakes his head no
lenny looks back at the model airplane
needs to think
evan lenny and kayleigh pass a junk pile in the woods
to lenny so what did you do in there
it was awful
you cant sleep cause everyones screaming all night long
i never want to go back
as evan and kayleigh absorb this in silence they see a column of smoke billowing in the horizon
do you see that
evan and kayleigh run toward the smoke
lenny nervously follows behind
they exit the woods to find tommy has stuffed a dog into a gunny sack which he douses with lighter fluid
next to a campfire
evan and kayleigh rush toward the trapped helpless dog
tommy is ready for them
he drops the lighter fluid picks up a wooden plank and swings
evan ducks back at the last minute and tommy accidentally connects with kayleighs head
knocking her unconscious
look what you made me do
whats wrong with you
tommy enraged fakes a high swing then goes for evans knee cap
evan doubles over in pain and falls to the ground clutching his knee
tommy moves to the fire crockett squirming inside the bag and picks up the lighter fluid
evan painfully looks up from the ground and his eyes dart from the sight of kayleigh unconscious to crockett trapped in the tied gunny sack
why dont you fucking kiss her prince charming
tommy squeezes the bottle hard creating a flaming fuse from the campfire to the fluid soaked dog
as the flames near crockett evan seething with rage stands up with clenched fists and charges tommy at full speed evan comes to in an unfamiliar place
still in running mode
his body contorts spastically like a fish on land since he is now lying face down on the ground
evan regains himself and sits up painfully
his face is badly bruised and he clutches his battered ribs
how long was i out
he gets no answer from lenny who stands in the exact same spot
tommy is nowhere in sight and the sound is of kayleigh weeping
evan spins to face her
are you okay
kayleigh her knees drawn tightly to her chest is unable to answer through her tears
evan struggles to rise but he becomes dizzy and falls back to the ground
evan takes a quick glance toward the gunny sack smouldering then moans and buries his head in his hands
a small neighborhood crowd has gathered to watch an ambulance with the sunnyvale insignia take an entranced lenny away
kagan is about to climb in the rear when she stops and turns to evan
ice cold do you know what you are
evan stands there speechless
a packed u haul sits in front of evans house
andrea shifts the small truck into gear and slowly pulls out
outside the truck kayleigh waves to evan tears spilling shamelessly down her cheeks
evan reaches behind his seat and opens a large cardboard box
it is filled with past journals
he finds the most recent journal uncaps a pen and writes something
finished he presses the journal to the window
ill come back for you
evan waves back to her trying nonchalantly to wipe away his own tears as she fades into the distance
when kayleigh disappears from sight andrea looks over to see what hes written
evan returns the journal and begins writing furiously
evan twenty now continues writing in a college blue book
he is older dressed down in worn jeans t shirt and plaid flannel
he closes the blue book with a cocky grin just as professor carter calls out to the class time
please place your blue books on my desk before you leave
evan grabs his psychology textbook from under his seat gets up and turns in his exam
howd you do evan
evan flashes a confident smile
im not sure
i might have gotten some stories mixed up
did pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts
laughing typical psych major
a complete wise ass
and hows your project coming
still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation
shrugging hey i got no choice
professor carter nods solemnly obviously in the know
evan bikes past students
evan bikes past some obnoxious greeks
evan docks his bike and carries his knapsack inside
evans dorm is cluttered double whose walls are adorned with head shop posters of gothic rock bands
by evans bed is a bookshelf filled with books on amnesia memory loss fugues hypnotism and other related bands
evans roommate thumper is a completely punked out gothic boy who weighs pounds
he currently hands a black lacy dress to cricket a pierced goth co ed
she slips the tattered dress on as thumper wipes his post coital self off with a black tee shirt
evan barges through the door throwing his pscyh books on the bed and politely looking away from the half naked girl
smells like patchouli and
evan opens the window and checks out his psych project a small maze has several flatworms at one end and a bowl of cornflakes at the other
cricket meet my well mannered roommate evan
cricket puts on her doc martens as evan watches the worms
yeah youre the one who fucked up the bell curve on my anthropology final
nice to meet you too
as she leaves thumper takes the black t shirt by his wallet and throws it on evans bed
found your t shirt
evan nods thanks picks up his journal
reads something and smiles
get dressed thumper youre taking me out for my birthday
i thought you were a december baby
this is bigger
seven years to the day
thumper pulls out a bong
lets do this
a popular watering hole
a dark rustic interior blasting alternative rock
plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their tables
evan and thumper play pool against two young women
heidi beautiful wears ripped jeans no make up
she sinks the eleven ball off the rail
kristen coolly smokes a cigarette confident that she and heidi will hold the table
which one of you has a pet worm
thumper proudly steps forward
thats so gross
thumper steps back points to evan
talk to him about it hes got the fetish
heidi sinks another ball and looks up at evan strangely
actually theyre for a psych project
a study on memory
heidi misses her shot and passes the cue to evan
stifling a yawn shit better explain before all the excitement gives me a heart attack
evan speaks as he knocks the one ball in the corner pocket
as he talks at a table behind them some obnoxious greeks including hunter spencer and gwen make fun of thumper
its an experiment with flatworms and a maze
you take a flatworm and run it through the maze until hes memorized it
then you put a new flatworm in the maze
banging into walls getting lost whatever
thoughtfully like ozzy
gwen giggles as spencer throws popcorn at thumpers head
ten bucks says he eats it off the floor
thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as evan knocks the three ball in the side
you chop up the smart flatworm and feed it to the dumb one and presto the dumb one suddenly knows the maze inside and out
evan walks past heidi putting his hand on her shoulder to squeeze by
the hand lingers longer than necessary and heidi doesnt mind
he sinks another ball
just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure it gets all of the worms memories
thoughtfully thats probably why hannibal lecters so smart
a handful of popcorn hits thumpers face
they all try to ignore hunter and spencers jeers
so whats the point
setting up the eight maybe if i can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function itll help me understand the complexities of the human brain
another barrage of popcorn hits thumpers jacket
although his hand clenches on the cue
he meekly shuffles away to the opposite side of the pool table from the cackling greeks
intrigued so are you planning on becoming a doctor or something
thumper casually takes the pool cue from evan
no i just dont want to lose my mind
as heidi digests this thumper carefully lines up his shot
the eight ball
the cue ball intentionally jumps the table rocketing into the pitcher of beer on the greeks table
theyre all soaked with beer and debris
just as they begin to rise thumper smashes the cue stick on the table whistling innocently while now brandishing a spear
they sit the fuck down
kristin impressed casually wraps her arm around thumpers waist
he smiles coolly its nothing
to heidi i think thats your game
evan and heidi making out burst through the door and fall on the bed
evans shirt is unbuttoned and heidi strokes his chest
suddenly heidi stops and sniffs the air
smells like sex in here
thumper had a busy afternoon
evan drunkenly crosses the room grabs two beers from the mini fridge
charisma and eyeliner go a long way i guess
heidi takes one
looks under the bed
most guys tuck their porn under here but all you have are
ive been keeping journals since i was seven
evan chugs his beer and sits next to her on the bed and puts his arm around her
no way id be too embarrassed
heidi teasingly runs her fingers over his smooth torso
then keep drinking worm boy
youre too uptight
evan stops short
no worm boy
worm and no worm master general
once you get a nickname like that you cant shake it
and i dont want everyone thinking ive got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something okay
now read me something
heidi hands him a book marked age
he flips it open to a random place and takes the beer from her hand
re her beer for courage
evan takes and finishes her beer and begins reading
as he reads he seems more and more on the verge of passing out
its like my mind refused to believe what it was seeing
hearing crockett make those awful screams
just writing about it gives me the shivers
color drains from evans face as he realizes what hes reading
he looks over at heidi who kisses him
come on go on
it was like tommy was possessed or something
there was a hate in his eyes that i couldnt really call human
as evan reads the world seems to almost imperceptibly vibrate around him like a tuning fork
his voice becomes distant and sounds echo around him like distant memories resurrecting themselves
evan is thirteen again
the scene begins exactly where evans blackout occurred as a child
tommy has just knocked kayleigh unconscious with a wooden plank lenny is frozen at the sight of crockett in the fluid soaked gunny sack
and evan seething with rage stands up with clenched fists and charges tommy at full speed
evan looks around utterly confused by his surroundings
what the hell is going on
before an answer comes tommy smiles at his good fortune and swings the plank hitting evans head
evan is sent sprawling backwards his forehead bleeding freely
tommy knocks evan hard in the ribs with his boots
evan writhes in agony his face against the ground
lenny moves toward the gunny sack lifts it and tugs desperately on the rope that traps crockett inside
i cant undo the rope
tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile
drop it or ill slit your mothers throat in her sleep
as if on cue lenny does exactly as hes told
his eyes begin to glaze over
evan beaten and bloody reaches out with his last bit of strength grabs tommys foot and holds on
i got him lenny
lenny remains frozen in place
tommy yanks his leg back breaking evans grip
evan groans on the ground in a writhing heap
tommys voice hitches
his eyes water from pent up frustration
listen to me good evan
theres a million other sisters in the world
you didnt have to fuck with mine
tommy smiles viciously at lenny traumatized to watch tommy pick up the lighter fluid and spray a liquid fuse from the campfire to the soaked gunny sack
and evan passes out
evan comes to with heidi slapping him awake
oh my god
heidi rolls her eyes
wake up idiot
it was just a dream
she stands and angrily puts on her jacket
freaked out it didnt feel like a dream
maybe because they never do
sarcastic so don juan you pass out on all your dates
evan doesnt even hear her
after getting his bearings he grabs his jacket and exits leaving her dumbfounded
evan exhausted finally pulls into lennys driveway
very little has changed in the past seven years
now making a model airplane
hes still overweight and looks like his mother dresses him
the room is filled with model airplanes
hundreds of them
a knock on lennys bedroom door
kagan grayer fatter opens the door and escorts evan inside
she glares at evan while pretending to be cheerful
ive got a surprise for you lenny
youll never guess whos here
lenny looks up to see evan his jaw drops
looking around shocked to see nothing has changed in the past seven years
the same kids toys posters and comic books
we see hes working on the model again in his own world
the window of opportunity for conversation has closed
hey uh its me
whats that youre working on
well you look busy so maybe i should make this quick
id totally understand if you didnt want to get into this right now but that day at the junkyard could you help me remember what happened
evan picks up a model airplane from the desk
i couldnt cut the rope
containing excitement yeah good what else do you remember
drop it or ill slit your mothers throat in her sleep
evan startled drops the model on the desk
it really happened
lenny stares out the window
what if i can get back all my lost memories with my journals
with lightning speed lenny jumps from his desk and unexpectedly shoves evan in to the wall
squadrons of hanging planes crash to the floor
lenny digs his fingers into evans shoulder
make one peep and i swear itll be your last motherfucker
evan is terrified
then lenny suddenly moves back and begins working on the model again his eyes a million miles away
evan is speechless
the door bursts open
kagan looks at the smashed model airplanes by evans feet
evan ignores her accusing stare
well thanks for seeing me man
i shouldnt have waited so long
when lenny doesnt respond mrs
kagan hustles evan back into the hallway
evan pulls a dozen journals from beneath his bed and begins pouring over them
nearby thumper empties a can of hairspray into his mohawk
you really think he wanted to kill you
all i know is that i might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories
he finds something hes looking for marks the page with a yellow post it note marked blackout and sets the book in a separate pile
as he sets the next journal on the bed it automatically opens up to a place where the spine was bent
staring up at him is the message i will come back for you
evan looks overcome by guilt
later that evening evan has now organized a pile of five journals
he selects an entry begins reading and suddenly closes the journal
fear covers his face
he holds one of his hands up and isnt surprised to see it trembling
he opens his journal again and reads out loud
reading aloud the last thing i remember before the blackout was holding my hands over kayleighs ears
his voice slowly fades i think i was more focused on her hands on mine than the mailbox across the street
his own words grow reverberant distant
furthermore the walls behind him vibrate slightly worse than before
evan kayleigh lenny and tommy all thirteen watch the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation
when evan comes to in this memory the lit cigarette absently drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt the mailbox
tick tock tick tock
like a staring contest
maybe it went out
should someone check it
yeah you do that lenny
suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls into the driveway
halpern an attractive young mother gets out of the car and walks to the mailbox
across the street tommy digs his fingers into the nerves of lennys shoulder
make one peep and i swear itll be your last motherfucker
tommys words make evan flinch
from inside the car a baby begins to cry
halpern walks back to the car
evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt sending the lit cigarette to the ground
he pulls up his shirt revealing a fresh burn mark on his stomach
hows my sweet girl
awww you need a change dont you honey
halpern picks her up and carries her to the house
as the mother unlocks the front door to the house the kids break into wide smiles of relief
the mother remembers the mail and carries the baby back to the mailbox
now tommy is the only one left still smiling
you want to open the door honey
the baby fumbles with the mailboxs door handle for a moment the blast is deafening
evan kayleigh and lenny watch the results in stunned horror
evan and kayleigh slowly back away in shock and begin to run a few steps when they realize that lenny isnt with them
oh my god oh my god
lenny doesnt seem to hear his eyes fixated on the crimson road
evan and tommy double back and grab him
they try to make him break out into a run but lennys feet drag limply against the ground
both tommy and evan grab an arm and begin to run with lenny through the woods
evan comes to
lurches his body over the bed and vomits
sounds of squeaky bed springs fill the room
looking sick and pale he lifts his shirt to see a new scar from the cigarette burn
what the hell
in the next bed thumpers head wrapped in a blanket pops up from above a naked geselas waist
you wanna clean that up before i lose my appetite here
evan sits upright in bed and begins writing in the margins of the journal
the lobby is decorated with colorful streamers balloons posters and banners announcing parents weekend
carefree students and their parents carry shopping bags toward the bustling elevators
evan leans against the side of a pay phone holding his ear to drawn out the noise
yes hello uh mrs
kagan this is evan treborn
rolling eyes i know
im sorry about that
but i really need to speak with him
shes obviously hung up on him
suddenly a hand grabs his shoulder
its professor carter
didnt mean to scare you evan
just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming
oh fine i guess
its been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up so i havent
i know i know
who can think of worms when your libidos in full swing right
evan shrugs and forces a smile
just dont drop the ball okay
i wont let you down professor carter
carter waves to another student and her parents and walks away
a waiter clears the dishes away from evan and andreas table
her hair now has gray streaks
as she signs for the bill she leans over and kisses evan on the cheek
people will talk
i cant help it
im just so proud of you
youve got the highest grades in all of your classes
did da jason get good grades
he got straight as without ever touching a book
that was the one area where his memory never failed him
did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time
andreas smile fades
why do you ask
no its just weird with him being such a brain and all i just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff hed forgotten
when he was around your age
almost exactly your age
he said he figured out a trick to remember the past
evan tries not to react
i couldnt tell if they were real memories or just phantoms
you know he might only have thought he actually remembered them
and then just before it got so bad that he had to be committed he said that he could
what could he do
andrea shakes her head
he was far too sick by then
evan nods but something gnaws beneath the surface
evan hastily hunts through his journals tearing up the room looking for a certain book
thumper lying on his bed quietly watches evan with growing concern
reading aloud i never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so i wanted to wear my clothes but mr
miller took his shirt off what the fuck are you doing
i need quiet for this
thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away
are you stupid or what
shucks i dunno
but maybe theres a reason why youve repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities dammit
thumper begins scanning the journal entry
a bitter laugh
id think twice about this
you could wake up a lot more fucked up than you are now
he hands the journal back to evan
evan opens it and begins reading it silently
his hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in defeat
evan looking haggard and frail wipes the greasy hair from his eyes and punches the accelerator
his teeth are clenched and he hammers his fist on the dashboard
evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner
he eyes a piece of paper with an address scrawled on it and gets out
a run down greasy spoon
filled with a number of townies and truckers
the place is stale with cigarette smoke and appears decorated in grime motif
evan is about to enter when he spots kayleigh coming out of the kitchen with a tray full of food
kayleigh now twenty looks pale and sickly thin
she bangs her hip on the swinging door and an order of food crashes to the floor
her boss stares back in aggravation
can we get through one goddamned day without you breaking something
kayleighs face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up the order
she is humiliated and evan leans back against a pay phone so that she cant see him watching her
as she brings the mess inside the kitchen a customer pinches her ass
evan closely studies her reaction to the offense
she flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the customer
evan backs out uncomfortably
kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she exits
evan steps out of the shadows
shes startled at first but eventually recognizes him
a smile flickers across her face and she allows herself to be hugged
i never thought id see you again
howve you been
oh comme si comme ca you know
i dont know
its been a long time
fill me in
im going to state now
things are going okay
kayleigh nods and they walk down the street
she reaches into her pocket pulls out a pack of smokes
declining not since we were kids
ive stopped a hundred times
so hows tommy
takes a long drag they kept him in juvy for a few years
now he works over at dales autobody
evan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question
you still live with your dad
her face is betrayed by a slight tick
i emancipated myself when i was fifteen
that mustve taken some courage
not if you remember my dad
couldnt you have moved in with your mom
shaking her head she had a new family
not enough space for me
said i should have moved in with her when we were kids
they walk in silence for a moment
actually kayleigh the reason i came back to town was to talk to you
are you kidding
remember when i was a kid i had all these blackouts
well lately some of the memories have begun to come back and id kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular
itd be a big help
ill try to remember
when we were kids
your dad was making a movie
robin hood or something
cold what do you want to know evan
what happened in the basement
it was a long time ago
i know but
cold is that why you came all the way back
to ask a lot of stupid questions about robin hood
no but i think something really bad mightve happened to us
kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette
is there a point to any of this
evans features shift from inquisitory to tenderness
he steps closer to kayleigh and softly strokes her face
she flinches at first but remains in the same spot
whatever happened it wasnt our fault
you know we couldnt have stopped it
kayleigh begins to tremble
this may sound like bullshit coming from a guy who hasnt spoken to you in seven years
she moves her face away from his hand
but you were seven years old and theres nothing you couldve done to deserve
her face collapses and she turns away
defeated just shut up evan
youre wasting your breath
you cant hate yourself just because your dads a twisted freak
who are you trying to convince evan
you come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory
you want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everythings all better now
well fuck you evan
nothings gonna be all better
nothing ever gets better
kayleigh runs stops and turns back to evan
if i was so wonderful evan why didnt you ever call me
whyd you leave me here to rot
she turns and runs away
evan looks sick with guilt
a few greeks play frisbee and talk trash
evan tired and depressed sits on the lawn nearby fingering the new burn scar on his belly
evan enters his dorm
he ignores thumper who sits on evans bed sucking furiously from a gurgling bong
he chokes out a message
some dude left a message for you
evan puts a towel under the door
you can smell it all the way in the bathroom
evan hits play on the answering machine
male voice hi evan this is professor carter
just wondered why you didnt hand in your essay this afternoon
i was a bit concerned
call me to schedule a make up
thumper offers evan a magnified frown of disapproval
male voice what did you say to my sister motherfucker
last night she cried on the phone for over an hour to me
enraged breathing she said you came and saw her last night
thumper coughs accidentally tips the bong over on evans bed
reacting quickly he grabs a towel from under the door and wipes off evans comforter
tommy contd she
she fucking killed herself tonight
beat and so are you
evan stares dumbstruck at the machine
whoa bad news bro
i dont think this is gonna come out
evan dressed in black gets out of his car at the edge of the cemetery
a small cluster of friends and family gather at the grave
evan grabs a bouquet of roses and begins walking to the grave
when he suddenly spots mr
miller and tommy
evans hands tense up into fists
he becomes weak in the knees and stops walking
after an uncomfortable moment of standing still he retreats to his car and watches the ceremony from the drivers seat
the last of the mourners are filing away
evan exits his car and walks to the deserted grave
he drops the roses on the casket and turns to make sure nobody is watching
evan reaches into his pocket and pulls out a sheet of paper
he unfolds it and leaves it on her gravesite ill come back for you
he makes a weighty decision and gets up
he hastily hunts through his journals looking for a certain book
evan opens his journal marked age
he plops on his bed and starts writing sideways in the margins
its been said that a persons life is little more than the sum of his experiences
if thats true then im not sure i know who i am anymore
beat i definitely never knew kayleigh
he turns the page and begins reading the journal
as he mouths the entry to himself the resonance of an older mans voice seems to reverberate throughout the room and the world behind his head faintly vibrates
miller plays with his camera and the kids are excited about playing robin hood in a movie
shut up moron
now get in your costume evan
evan slowly nods and begins to strip out of his clothes
miller takes a quick peek at him
ive got an idea
lets go downstairs itll look more like a dungeon down there
miller puts the camera on a tripod in the basement
kayleigh and evan sit on folding chairs in front of the camera
tommy stands at the top of the basement stairs looking down
to tommy what did i say about keeping that door closed stupid
but i wanna see
youre gonna see my fist in about two seconds unless you do what i tell you
tommy sulks and closes the door
miller lowers his voice and speaks to evan and kayleigh
now in this part of the story robin hood just married maid marian and they have to kiss and stuff like grown ups do
kayleigh giggles and covers her mouth with her hand
evan looks skeptical
so take your clothes off kayleigh
kayleigh stops giggling
evan says nothing
come on like when you take a bath
dont make a deal out of it
you too evan
miller gets behind the lens
the room is dead silent
who silently opens the door at the top of the basement stairs and watches with horror
evans face is flushed with rage
he walks behind kayleigh and cups his hands tightly around her ears
she cant hear anything now
what time is it
its time for you to stand where the hell i told you
wrong answer fuckbag
this is the very moment of your reckoning
in the next thirty seconds youre going to open one of two doors
the first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood
the mature speech seems completely surreal coming from a seven year old
miller looks around the room as if hes the butt of some sick joke
stunned disbelief whats happened to how are you doing that
voice rising itll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father
ultimately itll lead to her suicide
nice work daddy
hoarse whisper who who are you
evan impatiently waves the question
lets just say youre being closely watched george
your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat kayleigh like
oh lets say like how a loving father treats his daughter
sound okay to you papa
listen close then fuckbag
you screw up again and i swear ill flat out castrate you
the impact of the last sentence isnt lost on mr
one last thing
evan leans over to whisper in kayleighs ear
kayleigh stares at the floor then looks up at her father and shivers
kayleigh looks into evans eyes for support
evan nods go on
his confidence brings a boldness to her lips
dont you ever touch me again
i i wont
kayleigh summons her own new courage
and im putting on my clothes
as he leaves to pick up her clothes evan grins
what you need to do is discipline your son tommy because the kids one sadistic pup
hiding at the top of the basement stairs tommy recoils in horror and picks up one of his sisters dolls and begins twisting the head back and forth
a broad smile lines evans face as he slowly wakes up from his slumber
he suddenly grabs his head as if suffering from a pounding migraine
quick cuts and flashes of evan and kayleigh growing older she seems more carefree now full of life and less self conscious
evan pulls kayleigh around in a little red wagon
evan and kayleigh play in a tub of balls in the playroom
kayleigh pushes evan on a tire swing
tommy glaring at evan thrashes the teen punk
burning sack in flames
quick flash of the u haul driving away
at thirteen kayleigh spunkily hops off a greyhound bus and runs into evans arms
still thirteen evan peddles his bike by his new house kayleigh riding on the handlebars
more memory flashes of evan and kayleigh throughout the teen years they grow up as lovers now evan and kayleigh have romantic picnic on a rowboat
evan and kayleigh watch the sunrise after senior prom
finally the memory assault is over
evan groans in pain as blood trickles from his nose
an arm reaches over and touches his shoulder
honey are you all right
evan whips around to see kayleigh watching him
not only is kayleigh alive but shes a ravishing beauty
evan lurches back from the shock of seeing kayleigh and falls to the floor
she sees evans nose bleed and her eyes go wide
oh my god evan
look at you
evan still stunned can do little but stare from the floor
transfixed by her jesus kayleigh youre
looks around incredible
you give good compliment
clean up and come back to bed
he stands in the middle of her bedroom surrounded by sorority plaques and pink preppy decor
evan hardly able to take his eyes off her as she hands him a tissue
he reaches for his clothes at the foot of the bed and comes up with a greek lettered fraternity sweatshirt and brown suede jacket
where are my clothes
those are your clothes silly
evan frowns with distaste grabs a towel and heads out
at the sink evan washes the blood off his face and looks at his reflection in the mirror
a nearby shower shuts off
this is too amazing
un fucking real
i wish i could get so excited about a nose bleed
evan turns around and sees gwen one of the sorority brats from the bar exit the shower naked
evan blushes and turns back to the mirror through which gwen dries herself with a towel while staring flirtatiously back at evan
hey you were with those assholes who threw popcorn at thumper
evan holds his temple in pain as another memory comes to him
and your name is
lay off the blow
she pats his ass and exits the bathroom
kayleigh wearing a long skirt and tight red sweater catches the eye of every guy on campus
she and evan stroll arm in arm through the quad
somehow the world seems brighter now
even the colors seem more vibrant when compared to the somewhat grimmer world weve known
many students wave to evan and call his name
he cant remember all their names but its kinda cool being the bmoc
evan takes a long look at her and becomes curious
hey uh dont go freaking out on me over this but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera
well i remember he had one
but he like put it away after the first day
why would that freak me out
goofy smile just being weird
kayleigh playfully sweeps her leg around to kick him on the ass then smiles as if a ghost must have done it
such a goofus
see you tonight
kayleigh gives him a big unexpected kiss and walks away
after a moment of wow evan runs off to class himself
evan inserts his last quarter into the lobby pay phone and dials a telephone number
to himself come on mom be there
andreas voice andrea evans voice evan a strange older mans voice and chuck all three arent home right now
you know what to do
off guard hi mom and uh chuck
just calling to say hi and well call me
evan hangs up the phone then checks his watch
at that moment thumper passes evan in the lobby
what time is it man
thumper eyes this strange preppy kid with distaste
lost your rolex
fuck off frat boy
thumper walks away leaving evan dumbfounded
evan runs into the lecture hall and gets in line behind other students who are taking no
pencils from a box on professor carters desk
evan hears people he cannot see calling his name
somehow its more creepy than cool
the professor makes a loud announcement
only two weeks until your science projects are due
quietly i still owe you an essay from last week
is there any way i could get an extension
and you are
disappointed evan treborn
the answers no mr
now take a seat
the exams about to begin
evan walks up the aisle and takes a seat
as he sits down someone puts his arm menacingly around evans throat
evan flinches turns around and sees hunter the frat guy thumper assaulted the other night at dirty hanks bar
leave me alone asshole
i didnt lay a hand on you okay
hunter bursts out laughing
evan youre hysterical
you study for this
awkward well find out soon enough
laughing me neither
hunter surreptitiously hands evan a cheat sheet to the exam
evans face brightens
are these the answers
damn evan on the d
holding it lower thanks
hey i want to do something really special for kayleigh tomorrow
if i said i needed some help from you and the brothers
id say blow me
get the pledges to do it
evan nods and smiles as exams are passed down his row
evan and kayleigh have just finished having sex
she seems incredibly satisfied but he looks slightly uncomfortable
oh my god that was good
whered you learn all those new tricks
so it didnt feel
yeah if you call multiple orgasms weird
she giggles and snuggles into him
hes grateful for her affection but still looks uneasy
the phone rings and he automatically answers it
silence on the other end
as evan hangs up he and kayleigh share a giggle and he resumes snuggle position
what do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect
like looking back whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after i moved away
laughs as if my dad couldve stopped me from seeing you
whats he gonna do to me
evan smiles to himself
and hugs her tighter
you think well always be together
for the first time she looks at him with concern
that is the plan right
hell or high water
hes in heaven but plays it cool
just making sure
the pledges of theta chi busily gather around evan their clothes covered in dirt food and what might be vomit
evan now dressed like his usual self bangs a wooden spoon on a metal salad bowl that a poor theta chi pledge wears as a hat
so all you rushes know what youve got to do for me
correcting him pledges sir brother evan sir
pledges rushees same difference
now this is a one time deal
you do all this for me and ill never give you shit again
a buzz of excitement runs through the pledges
its peaceful now
evan covers kayleighs eyes with his hands as he leads her through the attic hallways
both are dressed to the nines
i dont understand where are you taking me
the wooden door to the rooftop swings open revealing kayleigh and evan
kayleigh is dazzled by what she sees the entire roof is decorated with fairy lights chinese lanterns and hundreds upon hundreds of candles
and elegant romantic table for two awaits them flanked by twelve formally dressed servants previously seen pledges who respectfully stare ahead with the utmost class
two pledges immediately pull out two chairs and stand by
kayleigh applauds and laughs with delight
i dont know what to say
as she takes a step toward the table flower petals shower down on her
she looks up to see two more pledges standing on ladders delicately tossing pedals
kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down
why are you doing all this for me
when i woke up this morning and saw your smile
i knew that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with you
her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely
her eyes tell him she feels the same way
a magical moment
and they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it might as well be their first ever hunter bolts up the stairs two at a time
we been lookin all over for you man
someone trashed your car
the moments gone
evan and kayleigh exchange worried looks
evan runs down the front lawn to his car the honda parked at the bottom of the hill
his face collapses
evans car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass
the seats and tires have been slashed the hood has been mysteriously yanked off and the steering wheel sits on the roof
the most unnerving thing however is a spiked leather dog collar hangs off the rearview mirror
by now a crowd has gathered
evan runs up to people
panicked did you see who did this
you see anyone
no one will answer with anything more than a shrug
probably them pika fuckers
but kayleigh knows better
she stares at the collar
how could he get away with this
right in front of the goddamn frat house
a senior brother angrily calls him from the lawn
hey man would you call your country a cunt
kayleigh shudders and evan puts his arms around her
hes probably watching
evan leads kayleigh into his bedroom and shuts the door
evan cant help but look under the bed
he then locks the door reaches into his desk and finds a tiny canister of pepper spray
its my fault
i should have told you he was released a few weeks ago
mighta been nice
re pepper spray like this is gonna do any good
maybe one of the frat guys has a gun
dont even joke
he wouldnt hurt you
hes just trying to scare you away from me
shaking the cannister yeah right
tell that to crockett
quietly its not his fault evan
you knew how bad he had it when we were kids
dont give me this oprah book club bad upbringing shit because you turned out fine
quietly my father never laid a hand on me
its like the prick saved it all up for tommy
evan sits in silence for a moment contemplating this
kayleighs eyes plead for him to have compassion
well let campus security deal with him
kayleigh and evan walk through the all but deserted campus
evan seems especially paranoid
in the distance some guy vomits loudly
are you okay
what do you mean
youve been acting kinda strange you know
i dont know
you make weird jokes
your accents changed
you dont even walk the same
i walk differently
i cant put my finger on it but everythings a bit off
even the dinner tonight
it was beautiful but
i know ive been actin strange lately
its just that
i dont want anything to happen to us
the guy along the path gags loudly into the bushes
kayleigh and evan instinctively avert their eyes
suddenly kayleighs ears perk and she stops walking mid stride
somethings not right
isnt that your jacket
the guy wearing evans brown suede jacket suddenly springs to his feet revealing his face for the first time
tommy has grown in the last seven years
he has long greasy hair and some tattoos
he holds a tire thumper a short steel bat for truckers menacingly in his right hand
evan stands frozen in fear his hands rooted in his coat pockets
leave us alone you sick fuck
get this us shit
as if i was gonna lay a hand on my own sister
youve done nicely for yourself evan
nice friends nice life not to mention youre fucking my sister
not a bad piece of ass if i say so myself
shut up tommy
aw hey now that was a compliment
tommy takes a few practice swings with the tire thumper
what the hell are you doing
it wasnt enough that the whole world loves you but you had to take away the last person on earth who didnt think i was a piece of shit
suppressing panic no one thinks youre a piece of shit tommy
i believe you just said sick fuck
tommy rushes evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in the shoulder and ribs
evan goes down
as tommy prepares to bash his brains in evan whips out the pepper spray and nails tommy in the face
tommy reels back in pain covering his eyes with this free hand
evan struggles to his feet and circles around tommy keeping a distance as he douses tommy with pepper spray
tommy blindly stumbles around madly swinging the tire thumper
evan charges forward in an uncontrollable rage rips the weapon out of tommys hands and sprays a lethal dose of pepper spray into tommys open mouth
youre gonna kill him
hes a fucking maniac
evan knocks tommy down with the tire thumper
kayleigh screams and tries to hold evan back but he easily wrestles free of her
she runs to a blue streetlight on the quad
he ruined lennys life evan kicks tommy hard in the ribs
kayleigh pushes a button on the blue light lamp post and an alarm wails
he killed crockett kicks him murdered that woman and her baby
kicks again and hes trying to kill me kayleigh
hes trying to fucking kill me
evan raises the tire thumper for a final attack and swings down off camera
evan sees what hes done and drops the weapon horrified
kayleigh sees what evans done to her brother
and stops cold when she sees the damage to tommy
evan rushes toward her and she stumbles backwards still terrified by his rage and skitters away from him in a crablike fashion
sirens come racing to the quad
evan looks away from tommys limp body
collapses to the ground and begins to weep
a security vehicle pulls through the ominous metal gates of the large state prison
the vehicle stops and evan along with nine other convicts exit in leg and hand restraints
evan now wearing his standard issue inmate uniform enters the general population area of the prison
prisoners begin screaming vicious taunts and catcalls at the fresh batch of new inmates
evan tries to keep composed and walks toward his cell
evan looks up to see one of the men leaning over the second tier karl a huge muscular con with tattoos of swastikas and other nazi symbols on his arm
blows a kiss at evan and winks
evan enters a dimly lit cell plastered with pictures of jesus christ and various saints
burning flames on open cans of shoe polish serve as candles to the large shrine
there is a stained bare mattress on the top bunk
sitting on the bottom bunk is carlos s a massive hispanic convict covered with faded indian ink jail tats of christ in agony
carlos stares at evan disinterestedly as evan makes up his bed on the top bunk
evan nods glumly
best not bitch up
wind up someones luggage that way
desperate can you protect me
jesus himself couldnt make me take on the brotherhood
when they come just put your mind in another place man
be somewhere else
a buzzer sounds
carlos leaves the cell without another word
evan sets his tray down at a table filled with carlos and some other inmates
no sooner has he sat down to eat do eager forks reach onto his tray and steal his food
carlos shrugs at evan and offers him a roll
andrea sits across from evan in the visitors chamber
her hair is now bottle blonde
four inches of plexiglas separate the two and they talk on monitored phones
andrea frazzled twirls an unlit cigarette
i spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal
hes sure he can get you off on self defense so if youre patient
how long will i be in here
i dont know
these things take time
hows kayleigh doing
she all right
andreas look tells him to look for hope elsewhere
what about my journals mom
did you bring the ones i asked for
andrea nods holding up two comp books
age and age
i found these
the others are still in storage
damn it mom
i told you i need them all
youll get them evan
but i think its far more important to focus on your case right now
evan looks as if hes about to disagree with her but he closes his mouth and placates her
just try to tell kayleigh im sorry
and officer signals evan and points to his watch
im not gonna lose you kiddo
promise me youll hang on ev
they look at each other and evan slowly lowers the phone
he hangs up andrea still pressing her phone to her ear
evan walks closely behind carlos through a corridor clutching his journals
as he passes karl the neo nazi karl reaches over and firmly grabs evans crotch
evan totally violated turns white with rage
shit on my dick or blood on my knife
evan stands there stunned unable to react when another neo nazi rick swats evans journals out of his hands and onto the floor
life springs back into evan as he rushes for the journals
he and rick grab the journals at the same time
a minor tug of war
rick tears them away evan coming up with only a few torn pages
evan sees the damage and goes mental
evan swings at rick and misses
rick lunges for evan a brief and painful scuffle ensues the journals getting trampled
suddenly the sounds of cocked rifles echo through the air
the fight stops instantly as rick and evan look up to see officer station
officers aim rifles at the pair
from an upper tier even more officers with more rifles
their barrels sight directly at evan
rick steps away quick to maliciously scoop up evans torn journals
well be comin for you tonight sister
evan catches his breath then looks at the remaining few pages on the floor
evan enters the cell with a few entry pages
he looks through them
evan nods depressed then sees the page from his age journal grabs carlos duct tape and tapes the page over his bed
evan walking toward some white supremacists flinches whenever the occasional inmate brushes against him
evan is completely paranoid waiting for an inevitable attack
karl makes himself visible among them holding a journal
he reads from evans journal today i found my grandfathers death certificate
he died in a nut house just like my father
mom denies it but she thinks im gonna end up the same way
the other supremacists start laughing and calling looney and nut job
evan rushes past them and they make chicken clucks at him
evan and carlos sit on bleachers that overlook the other prisoners working out
evan closely watches karl and rick who stare daggers at him from across the yard
a skinhead passes something with a white taped handle to karl but no officers seem to notice
evan slides closer to carlos and stares at the jesus christ tattoos all over carlos back
youre religious carlos you believe that bit about the lord works in mysterious ways
because i think he sent me to your cell on purpose
for you to help me
i knew you were crazy
i aint bullshitting
jesus speaks to me in my dreams
carlos scoffs whatever
pack of smokes says i can prove it to you
carlos is suddenly interested
evan holds a tattered journal entry in his hand and finishes up a conversation
carlos looks dumbfounded
so when im out i need you to watch my face and hands closely
you need to see the prison shrink man
their conversation stops when a convict rolls a mail cart by evan looking up expectantly
just not for you
disappointed evan turns back to carlos
holds up his journal entry
just tell me if anything weird happens
weirder than this
marks scars i dunno
anything could happen i guess
evan studies the page
on wednesday i got in trouble for a drawing that i didnt do
mommy wont let me see it
then as he starts reading it to himself the bars behind him almost imperceptibly vibrate evan seven comes to in an old familiar place
we are back in mrs
boswells first grade class
all of the children draw colorful pictures
evan sees some paper spindles sitting on mrs
as he heads over to them mrs
boswell firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own desk
no monkey business evan
sit still and finish your drawing
evan defeated looks over at his blank piece of paper
he smiles mischievously and grabs some colored pencils
thats great everyone
just imagine anything you want to be
there are no limits
soon enough an image emerges evan holding a knife stands over a heap of several dead inmates karl and rick
when done he sneaks over to mrs
boswells desk where the two paper spindles sit
the metal needles reach up and skewer a number of paper notes and messages
evan looks over to see mrs
boswell holding up his drawing horrified
musically oh mrs
she looks over in time to see evan using all of his seven year old strength to whip his hands down toward the spindles
the moment before his palms reach them theres a brief instant where soundscapes collide and the world behind him vibrates
evan comes to as echoes of screaming children fade
alertness slowly creeps back up on him as he hears oh sweet jesus
its a miracle
evan looks up to see carlos staring at him with reverence
evan looks to see two scars in the center of each palm
what did you see
what did it look like
laughing signs of the lord
they just appeared out of nowhere
i thought you were loco
so you believe me
carlos simply stares at him awestruck and hands over a box of cigarettes
evan nervously approaches
a crew of aryans block his path
i want to make a deal
the aryans laugh make discrete eye contact with karl who grins and signals to let evan pass
karl and rick wait expectantly as evan nervously enters
they say nothing relishing the fearful silence
im new to all this but i think i get how things work
you gotta join a gang or else end up dead meat
they continue to stare
well it sure aint gonna fucking be with no niggers or spics
so how do we do this
you gotta work your way up and im the new guy
looking ill so
i mean do i suck your dicks right now
karl and rick exchange looks
is your blood pure
angry i aint no fucking kike if thats what you mean
lets see what you got
and watch the fucking teeth or youll be leaving without em
evan nods reluctantly and peacefully drops to his knees
karl and rick lower their pants to their ankles
evan looks miserable about to do the deed when carlos bulldozes past the aryans into the room slamming karl into the wall and jamming a shank into karls crotch
rick instantly charges carlos but trips on the pants around his ankles
evan anticipating ricks fall stomps ricks face before snatching his journals from karls shelf
evan frantically flips through them hunting for something as the other white supremacists charge the cell
carlos drops karls writhing body to the floor and presses his girth against the cell door
evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as the other supremacists force the door open evan focuses on the words
we took the woods behind the junkyard just to make sure we wouldnt bump into tommy
we hadnt seen the smoke yet
words from the entry begin to shimmer
reverberant sounds of barking break the sound barrier and the image of aryans storming the cell behind him become a frenetic blur evan thirteen again comes to in the woods
evan stumbles at first then rights himself
he seems strangely exhilarated
a sinister victory smile
rot in hell you fucking animals
kayleigh and lenny walking by his side do a double take
evan shrugs just kidding and looks around getting his bearings
he whips his hand out and stops them
before we he suddenly notices kayleigh who now no longer looks an awkward and unkempt tomboy but rather a vibrant and feminine young girl
whereas her clothes were loose and unflattering before she is now radiant and wears fashionable styles
evan remembers his mission and darts over to a junk pile
we need something to cut open the sack
kayleigh and lenny stare at him concerned for his sanity
evan roots through the trash until he finds something a razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long
evan offers it to lenny
i want you to take this lenny
todays your day of atonement
i know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby evan
its not the time
frantic nows the only time
to lenny today you get a chance to redeem yourself
start over with a clean slate
tabula rasa what are you talking about
youre acting crazy
desperate to lenny please
if youve ever trusted me before trust me on this one
evan places the metal shard in lennys hand
cut the rope
lenny slowly follows evan as he bolts away
evan groans on the ground writhing
tommys voice hitches eyes watering from pent up frustration
listen to me good evan
ill do whatever you want
you dont want me to ever see kayleigh again fine
just let crockett go
besides you kill him now and theyll stick you in juvy for sure
and i know youd never leave your sister alone with your father
evans words hit home and tommys anger slowly dissipates
a look of understanding passes between them
tommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it
lenny comes screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell
with all of the force he can muster he jams the metal shard all the way through tommys throat
tommy clutches his throat gagging in blood
evan surveys the scene in shock oh fuck lenny no
lenny drops to the floor indian style wipes the dirt in his hands and freezes up completely
kayleigh wakes up and screams when she sees blood spurt from tommys throat
meanwhile crockett escapes from the sack
lenny silhouetted by the sky seems to vibrate violently as if operating a jack hammer
evan comes to in a familiar place
his original college dorm christ
he sits upright in bed and takes in his surroundings
when suddenly evan clutches his head in severe pain
color memories of kayleighs sorority fade to black and white and dissipate
memories of evans vandalized car fade to black and white and dissipate
the faces of karl and rick all turn grainy
as new images of thumper become more brilliant
a new image overwhelms the others lenny with dark soulless eyes wearing a straight jacket in a padded room
evans eyes roll back in his head
he shakes uncontrollably and blood pours from his nose
thumper opens the door sees evan convulsing and jumps back in horror
he scans the hallways for assistance
evan lies on an examining table undergoing another series of cat scans
the machines are now state of the art and the lab room has been redecorated
andrea nervously chews her fingernails as she watches dr
redfield post cat scan results on the light box
a young nurse pushes evan in a wheelchair into the doctors office
whats the damage
how much time have i got
its a little complicated
i havent seen results exactly like these before
are you sure
not even with my father
redfield and andrea exchange looks
actually these tests werent available twenty years ago
so what did you find
redfield points to the cat scan slides specifically to the outer lining of evans brain
this is where were finding most of the hemorrhaging
the outer lining of the cerebral cortex
nonplussed lemme guess
would that be where the memories are stored
redfield stares ahead
transfixed by the slides
ive never seen anything like this
ive compared these to the ones taken last year and theres evidence of severe hemorrhaging and massive neural reconstruction
andrea stares at him blankly
evan impatiently pops wheelies in the wheel chair
what does that mean for evan
to andrea hes saying its like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year
sat about the gist of it doc
redfield nods awed by evans effortless interpretation
evan springs out of the wheelchair and stretches his legs
to andrea mind if i wait in the car
the lighting here bugs my eyes
evan shakes dr
well its nice seeing you again
but you know people to see things to read
andrea shoots dr
redfield an apologetic look
evan heads out the door accidentally knocking dr
redfields jacket to the floor
he shrugs apologetically and re hangs it
outside the office evan inspects dr
redfields keys and attached security card and smiles
evan covertly winds himself through the maze of corridors careful not to be seen by the staff
he finally sees a wing marked criminally insane
evan looks around to make certain hes not being watched then uses the security card to open the door
he looks in every room of the wing until he finds evan unlocks the door and is moved by what he sees
lenny is strapped onto a metal bed his arms and legs in tight leather restraints
the dark five oclock shadow and his malicious grin radiate evil
his black and haunting eyes personify hate and murderous intent
lenny seems neither surprised or happy to see evan
that is if hes aware of evans presence at all
is there anything you need
anything i can get you
nothing from lenny
what about the models man
bet i can get you a shitload of models up in here
not even a glance in his direction
evan sighs and gives up
just wanted to say hi
evan turns around to leave
you knew the whole time didnt you
evan spins around when you put the blade in my hand you knew something big was going to happen
jaw dropped y
i guess i did
lennys eyes seethe with hate
then you should be where i am
you should be where i am
evan backs away face guilt stricken
evan enters his dormroom where everythings backwards reaches under his bed and is relieved to find the journal marked age
evan is ignored by several theta chi pledges as he plops himself by a tree and hunts through his journal to find the entry from when he was seven and
visited jason at sunnyvale
today i get to mete my father
his name is jason and he is crazy
i hope he lets me call him dad
evan takes a calming breath and begins reading
as if reciting a mantra today i get to meet my father
his name is jason and he is crazy
evan gets some strange looks but continues
as he does the trees and frisbee playing students behind him vibrate and seven year old evan comes to during the time he first met his father jason
jason waits patiently for young evan to finish his sentence
are you okay
you looked like you were somewhere else for a second there
look jason i need some fast answers if im ever gonna fix what ive done
jason is completely thrown
i was praying this curse would have ended with me
but it didnt
and now i need info to make things right again and youre the only one who can give it to me
frustrated there is no right
when you change who people are you destroy who they were
whos to say you cant make things better
jason seems extremely upset to hear evan say this
you cant play god son
it must end with me
just by being here you may be killing your mother
ill send you a postcard when ive made everything perfect again
jason launches himself across the table shackles and all and grabs hold of evans throat
as jason looks down at us frothing at the mouth theres a trick of the light where jasons head seems to vibrate against the ceiling
evans hands instinctively reach for his throat then he realizes his surroundings
heartbroken he shuts the journal and stands up shakily
evan eats in the same diner where kayleigh used to work
as he eats his arm sits in front of his plate protectively
guarding his food
just get out didja
re his arm nothing
just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that
defensively i come from a big family
meant no offense
hey uh does kayleigh miller still work here
never heard of her
evan slowly walks up the driveway which is now a dilapidated mess
garbage litters the front lawn and paint chips rot off the sides of the house
miller yells at someone
just shut the hell up already
cant a man get a little goddman peace in his own home
evan rings doorbell oh for christs sake now what
miller opens the door and sees evan
dont suppose youre here to sell cookies
in a blur evan grabs mr
millers shirt and violently shoves him through the house and into a wall
good guess fuckbag
off millers startled face remember me now
we had a great chat once when i was seven
miller goes slack his eyes wide with horror
one question fuckbag
where can i find your daughter
evan walks past some junkies and enters
evan steps over some passed out bodies that litter the hallway of an incredibly seedy motel
the kind with hourly rates
he knocks on a door
kayleigh now haggard strung out junkie opens the door and immediately the contempt for evan grows in her eyes
she puts out an expression of disappointment
oh i thought you were my eight oclock
make it fast im expecting someone
nice to see you too
can i come in
she looks around waves him in
if i knew you were coming id have cleaned the stains off the sheets
the room is dirty and sparse excepting charred bottom spoons yellowed cotton balls and brown spotted squares of tin foil
evan doesnt hesitate to sit on the soiled bed
what do you want
evan cant speak
his eyes begin to water
i just needed to see
a friendly face
his sincerity touches her
well time is money evan
evan reaches for his wallet and throws it on her dresser
kayleigh eyes the wallet
but makes no move to pick it up
well i guess i can spare ten minutes for an old friend right
tears fall freely from evans eyes
so hows tricks
sorry occupational humor
i get it
you can drop it now
angry again oh im sorry
does my line of work make you uncomfortable precious
just that you need to hurt me with it
ive been where youve been
when youre just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack
kayleigh watches evan silently
whats happened to you
you wouldnt believe me
i mean people always say you wouldnt believe me but in this case its not even worth trying
ive seen some sickening shit
i dont blink twice anymore especially in your case
let me ask you a question
just a little one thats been gnawing at me for years
on the bridge
how did you know that tommy had your dog
that was no fucking hunch
do you remember when i was a kid and i had those blackouts
evan continues and kayleigh listens with a mixture of intense interest and matched skepticism
kayleigh finishes a plateful of food at a busy diner
she lights up an after dinner smoke
youre right evan i dont believe you
i never thought you would
thats why ive never bothered to tell a soul until now and why i never will again
im the only person youve told
thats a great line
does that make other girls swoon
do they actually eat up this bullshit
i couldnt give a shit if you believe me or not and frankly im too tired to prove it to you
theres proof now
how would i know about the twin moles on your inner thigh
anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that
then forget that
you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you it reminds you of your step sister
kayleighs jaw drops
and when you orgasm your toes go numb
im sure your clientele arent privy to that one
kayleigh tries to conceal the surprise in her eyes
i just thought you should know
that i didnt leave you there to rot
kayleigh flinches as if her should had been invaded then her eyes fill with distrust and contempt
theres one major hole in your story
there is no fuckin way on this planet or any other that i was in some fuckin sorority
she opens evans wallet and leaves a twenty on the table
sure you dont want your wallet
dont think ill need it where im going
off to change everyones life again is that it
maybe this time youll pop up in some mansion while i wind up in tijuana doing the donkey act
im over it
whenever i try to help anyone it all turns to shit
well dont give up now slick
youve already done so much for me
hell why dont you go back in time and save mrs
halpern and her baby
then maybe lenny wouldnt freak out and ruin my family
she gets up and puts on her coat
oh heres one
go back when im seven and fuck me in front of daddys handicam you know straighten me out a bit
she tosses his wallet over her shoulder at him and leaves
evan enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar sounds of thumper having sex with another naked gothic co ed
on evans bed
both of you
just figured itd be okay with you bein sick and all
evans temper flares and he picks up a chair and smashes it against a wall above thumpers head
im not saying it again
thumper and the co ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets and leave
alone in the room evan looks under his bed and breathes a sigh of relief to see all of his journals are intact
he sifts through them again
he finally finds the passage he needs
something catches the corner of evans eyes and he turns to examine it
to the left of thumpers buddha statuette sits a large votive candle that bears a portrait of jesus christ
humble lord give me the strength and guidance i need to set things right
as he begins reading a passage to himself sounds echo backward at us from another time and place
and the entire room shimmers around him evan comes to as he kayleigh lenny and tommy all thirteen watch mrs
halpern carry her baby back to the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation
evan suddenly comes to life and makes himself visible running across the street shouting
lady stay back
dont go near the mailbox
halpern startled stares at the young kid skeptically as she absently continues toward the mailbox
i mean it woman
get the hell back
lenny comes running across the street to evans aid and tommy shrugs and follows after him
theres a bomb in the mailbox
tommy still running cringes to hear lennys stupid confession and rolls his eyes at the situation
evan positions himself between mrs
halpern and the mailbox frantically waving his hand at her to stay back because shes still ill save you lady
tommy takes a running dive at mrs
halpern perhaps a bit too hard and sends her and the baby to the pavement hurt but no major injuries
seeing things are safe evan backs away from the mail the blast is deafening
evans body is hurled backwards dramatically
evan comes to back in his dorm the same posters are on the wall the sheets are the same
even the familiar sounds of thumper having sex under the covers
i thought i told you two to beat it
evans face falls as he hears a familiar voice but not thumpers
hey sorry man
we wake you up
evan is confused by lennys presence but smiles to himself and shakes his head no
no its cool
re lennys okay really cool
evan yawns bringing his hand to his mouth but theres no hand
no arm really either
just two fleshy stumps
evan bolts upright in bed and stares down at his amputations
we see countless and brief image flashes of evan growing up from the age of thirteen with no arms and requiring a tommy and kayleigh load popcorn and drinks onto
evans lap as lenny pushes the wheelchair
evan celebrates his th birthday and blows out the candles
andrea kayleigh tommy and lenny all clap
tommy pushes evan to church
evan screams as blood pours from his nose
lenny is out of bed at once to help him
as is kayleigh
now beautiful and natural looking
lenny and kayleigh as teens sit together with evan at the far end of the boat
evan looks on longingly as lenny and kayleigh become lovers in high school
evan sips from a beer cap as lenny and kayleigh make out in plain sight with tommys bashful approval
evans in agony as kayleigh opens a series of dorm doors and lenny rushes evans wheelchair through
kayleigh carries a pair of prosthetic arms in her hands
evan moans and tries to rub his temple with his stump
where are we going
we have to get you to sunnyvale
youre having one of your famous hemorrhages
take me back
sorry tough guy no can do
your mother would kill me
evan launches his body forward and spills clumsily out of the wheelchair
lenny must halt in order not to crush evan
as evan writhes about on the floor his legs paralyzed a evan focuses on lenny but its hard to ignore the crowd that titters and snickers in the background
take me back lenny
teeth clenched you owe me that much
kayleigh turns to face the jeering crowd
what are you geeks looking at
must be nice to be so goddamned perfect huh
the crowd breaks up and leaves
its calm now
lenny and kayleigh push evans wheelchair around the quad
evan now wears prosthetic arms
random people call out to lenny
hes extremely popular in this world
we missed you at the party
dont even think im giving you my lab notes either
think i like getting up for eight thirtys
lenny pushes evan past thumper and cricket
their conversation stops and they stare at their feet as evan gets wheeled by
evan boils to be treated as if he were non existent
hey theres tommy
evan spins around in fear
he sees tommy clean cut and handing out flyers in front of a banner that reads campus crusade for christ
tommy seems good natured now working hard and soliciting names for his list
he looks up as evan rolls along and his eyes brighten to see evan
i did what you said man
were pooling our student funds with hillel house and were going to have an awareness dance
oh goody nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of hava nagila til i puke
tommy frowns and exchanges glances with lenny who shrugs and nods back to him
uh we should be getting to class now
whats the point of psych now
tomorrow i could wake up as some dirt farmer in bangladesh
another exchanged glance
kayleigh looks at evan
lets go for a stroll
evan allows kayleigh to roll him away from the others
to the very spot where evan once killed tommy
evan stares at his prosthetic hand which he can magically will to open close open close
so tommys really into this jesus kick huh
kayleigh looks at him curiously
you know how spiritual hes gotten ever since he saved mrs
halpern and katie
he saved mrs
please the twisted fuck
kayleigh now by a bench
stops and sits
as she casually uses her foot to turn his chair to face her she pulls out a granola bar and hands it to him
his prosthetic hand crushes it
it crumbles to dust
she seems more confused
is something the matter
re prosthetic arms yeah i think i gotta get these fixed or something
she leans into him gently feeding him her remaining bar
do you ever think about us
i mean wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us
sure evan why not
you were the first person i really ever cared about
thats why when i was little i never went to live with my mother
i dont get it
feeding another bite when my folks split they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with
i couldnt stand my dad but i knew if i moved to my moms id never see you again
i never knew that
so then you still sometimes think of us
its crossed my mind from time to time
well a lot of things cross my mind
ive always been a fast thinker ev
i can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second
boom we fall in love get married two kids your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature kids grow old as do we relatively stable relationships matching burial plots
the whole bit
it took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine
then you think it might have worked out
but thats not how things wound up
im with lenny lennys your friend
and there it ends
she looks into his eyes and shrugs almost apologetically
tears streak down evans face as he speaks in a pleading tone
would it make any difference if i told you that no one could possibly love anyone as much as i love you
kayleigh shakes her head sadly then suddenly looks up
evan turns to see lenny waving her over
she puts her hand on evans shoulder stands and goes to lenny
evan cant take his eyes off her
lenny kissing kayleigh
in painful slo mo
evan turns away utterly heartbroken
evans stump turns on a bathtub faucet
evan fully clothed lies in a bathtub thats filling with water
beside the tub the wheelchair has been tipped over
the water rises past his mouth to his nostrils evan makes his peace and takes a final breath
and the water spills over the side of the tub
all evan can do is watch it still breathing easily through his nose
then the door opens
immediately sizing up the situation
you forgot to put the toaster on the edge
tommy casually turns off the water then pops open the drain
the water level lowers to evans mouth
but you kayleigh and lenny like toast
and thats really all that matters now
tommy feels evans anguish and plops his ass on the wet floor by the tub
he lays his head onto evans shoulder
evan bristles at first but finally gives in to his hatred ultimately resting his own head against tommys
taking the comfort offered
ill get you changed
visiting hours are almost up
tommy rolls evan through a quiet hospital corridor
looking around what did mom get transferred again
tommy frowns confused then rolls evan into evan is startled to see andrea hooked up to several ivs an oxygen tank and a respirator
several oxygen hoses connect to a tracheotomy tube
tommy smiles and kisses andrea on the cheek
she tousles his hair in return
evan can hardly speak
as tommy begins to wheel evans chair closer to andreas bedside andrea utters a faint whisper
evan eyes her medical clipboard as hes wheeled by
reading lung cancer
hes been out of sorts lately
andrea flinches to hear this
evan stares at her eyes wide
you started chain smoking after i blew myself up
evan suddenly seems sick with guilt
there must be a way to fix this
i just need the entry about the blockbuster
wait shit no arms
i never even got the chance to write it
a flicker of recognition registers in her eyes
hes just going through some tough times
i can change this
i think ill go check out the chapel
like your father
come on mom
just cause dad was my age when he started going crazy doesnt mean that im nuts
andrea is shocked
you told me that on parents weekend
wait that wasnt me
she uses her left hand to pinch off the air to her oxygen tube and forces herself to speak in a sick gravely manner
im gonna get you out of here
he pushes a lever and the mechanical wheelchair rolls itself out of the room
andrea forces her loudest raspy scream
lenny tears through old cardboard boxes in evans closet
evan watches nearby
are you sure you even packed it
my mom packed for me
i think she sent everything i ever owned
so well see
evan watches lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of evans junk on the floor
old report cards books toys and photo albums fall on the floor
is this it
evan beams when he sees lenny holding his old journal
what do you need it for
i dont get you lately
now im gonna ask you for one last favor
i need to concentrate on the blockbuster if im gonna destroy it
concerned destroy it
if i hadnt blown my arms off mom never woulda started smoking in the first place
lenny utterly baffled sits back in silence and watches evan begin reading his journal to himself for a beat
as new sounds echo backward
theres a evan comes to in his childhood kitchen
he is only seven years old
he coughs up lucky charms that have magically appeared in his mouth
on a journal before him is the recently written passage today mommy is taking me to play with kayley and tommy
i will mete there father and see what a real dad is like
andrea is nowhere in sight
evan springs to his feet and flexes his real hands triumphantly
now how do i destroy the blockbuster
he rummages through the utensil drawer and pulls out a large butcher knife and grabs it
he tucks it into his sock but it wont fit
hes still debating what to do when andrea walks in and is startled by the unexpected sight of evan holding a huge knife
evan sees her but remains expressionless
andreas face blanches
what are you doing with that knife
evan comes to to find lenny still staring at him
waiting for something big to happen
well that didnt work
evan flips a single page of his journal and tries again
he reads to himself then relaxes his head evan seven again stands in the basement dressed in his robin hood costume as mr
miller prepares for the sex scene
now in this part of the story robin hood just married maid marian and they have to kiss and stuff like grown ups do
there seems to be a new glint of intelligence in evans eyes as he adjusts to his new surroundings
i need my belt
miller is puzzled but watches evan skip to the fireplace
overly childlike loo loo skip to my loo
loo loo skip to my loo
miller puts his eye back to the viewfinder as evan quickly finds mr
millers old army thermos in the bottom drawer of the dresser opens it and shakes out the blockbuster
loo loo skip to my loo
he tries to crack it with his own hands but his seven year old body is too weak
hey kid dont bother with the belt
miller finally turns around and sees evan banging the blockbuster on the table
shock registers in mr
millers eyes and he takes a step towards evan
back off fuckbag
miller freezes on that and evan smiles at him
that word never fails to make an impression with you
miller takes a slow non threatening step toward evan
easy does it evan
dont be a bad boy or ill tell mommy you were naughty
and ill tell the child protective services about your kiddie porn endeavors
one step closer and ill shove this up your ass
kayleighs mouth hangs open with utter amazement at the scene
tommy hiding at the top of the stairs slowly creeps down to get a better view
evan rummages in the bureau and finds the wooden strike anywhere matches used at thirteen to light his cigarettes
you could blow your hands off
been there done that
evan standing near the fireplace defiantly strikes the match with this thumb and lowers the flame to the short fuse
miller charges evan just as the fuse is lit
miller knocks the blockbuster from evans hand and it rolls towards the other side of the room resting peacefully against the video camera
kayleighs eyes are dazzled by the sparkling fuse and she bends down to pick it up kayleigh
the blast is deafening
evan twenty wakes up with a bloody nose
oh god kayleigh
evan gets a new series of quick images and flashed faces
evan now seven is institutionalized before a judge
evan seven through twelve grows up in an institution
evan undergoes years of therapy under redfields care
evan lies in a room same posters from college adorn the walls
blood flows freely now
sobbing uncontrollably kayleigh
you cant die again
i wont let this happen
evan fights off the pain and looks under his bed for something
where are they
his journals are missing
he runs from the room
evan runs into dr
redfields office just as another patient is leaving
whats the big rush
we dont meet for another hour
where are my goddamn books
where are they
the doctor looks heartbroken as if evan has had a relapse
it kills me to have to go through this again
there are no journals
there never were
its part of this fantasy world your mind created to cope with the guilt of killing
evan looks stunned
refusing to believe it
youve invented a disease that doesnt exist
alternate universes with colleges prisons paraplegia
i need those books
you remind me of your father
he always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one
evans eyes roll back and he collapses lifelessly to the floor
evan lies on a platform and gets another series of cat scans
evan no longer incapacitated stares out the window into the darkness
later that day dr
redfield posts the new cat scan slides on the light box and shudders when he sees the results
andrea looks on anxiously
andrea biting her nails is unable to conceal her fear
no dances just tell me
devastated the hemorrhaging
the neural damage is irreparable
im frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions
andrea begins to break down in tears
evan secretly listens in from the hallway
his gaunt face looks deep in thought
he takes a breath and enters the lab making sure not to look directly at his weeping mother
hey mom didja remember to bring those goofy old home movies we used to make
andrea wipes tears away nodding in advance
evan sees no one is watching him in the institution corridor as he throws his weight into the door of the doctors office breaking it open
sporadically severe vibrations invade evans environment threatening to distract him from his mission
evan enters the office and tears the file cabinets apart looking for something
his nose bleeds profusely and he repeatedly wipes the blood off his face with irritation
evan sees a cardboard marked treborn e
grabs it and hides under the doctors desk
flashlight beams stab through the darkened corridor hunting for him
an alarm sounds
guards are shouting
evan under the doctors desk grabs some paper and begins writing in shorthand
if anyone finds this then i guess my plan didnt work and im already dead
again the world flutters as if it were attached to a paint shaker
he takes a deep breath
but i i can just go back to the beginning of all this i might be able to save her
fatigue overwhelms him but he continues writing
redfield catches up with the rest of the guards
hes not in his room
search the grounds
the cardboard box is overturned
evan finishes threading a super film projector and turns it on
careful not to let any light spill against the wall evan projects it at the underside of the desk
we see familiar home movie footage from his childhood lenny has a birthday party
kayleigh is there
getting lost in the memory
chaotic noises of childrens party bleed into evans reality
the world shudders uncontrollably
evan comes to at a birthday party
hes unexpectedly gently prodded forward by andrea
go on evan
evan slowly approaches kayleigh only five
she smiles bashfully at him
an old memory comes back to him
when my folks split they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with
i couldnt stand my dad but i knew if i lived with my mom id never see you again
evan slowly looks around the yard taking in the reality of this distant memory
he even inhales the aroma of the place
savoring the moment
he locks eyes with kayleigh
hes not usually this shy
evan leans over to kayleigh as if hes about to kiss her
then whispers in her ear i hate you
if you ever come near me again ill kill you and your whole family
kayleigh reacts predictably
bursting into tears and runs into kayleighs mothers arms
what did you say to her
evan ignores them
he cant take his eyes off kayleigh
his eyes well up
evan wakes up with a bloody nose
he grabs a pillow and covers his head with it as a flood of memories seizes him
lenny looking fit grabs a towel from atop an award winning flatworms project and hands it to evan
should i call the doctor
evan groans and shakes his head no
he rides out the pain like a seasoned pro
when it finally subsides he lowers the pillow and smiles feebly
ill think ill be alright this time
a new hope i really do
lenny nods still concerned
evan opens the door to a concrete room with a large furnace
he and lenny carry cardboard boxes
you sure about this
they silently dump tons of journals into the fire
evan steps outside and returns with a box of home movies photo albums old report cards etc
in they go
evan a suit now walks down a city street cradling a cell phone to his ear
into phone yeah ma
im running a little late for lunch
one of my patients had a breakdown
anyway order some soup in the meantime
see ya soon
as he clicks off an attractive woman wearing a power suit approaches from the other direction
evan has to look closely but its kayleigh
a mature woman now
he stumbles slightly caught off guard
as she passes her eyes linger on his a little longer than necessary but theres no recognition
evan watches her continue past him and down the sidewalk
after a hesitant beat he takes a breath turns around and follows her
