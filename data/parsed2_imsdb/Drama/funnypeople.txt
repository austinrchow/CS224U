written by judd apatow april george simmons sits in a giant living room watching bad television on a inch flat screen tv
he looks bored and empty
after a few beats he pauses the tv and picks up the phone
on the phone hey its george simmons im coming in
shots of george doing stand up on stage at a comedy club
the place adores him
we see quick images of him after the show interacting with people
he is clearly a very famous comedian
george has sex with a girl in her early twenties
george sits back down the thrill of his performance is gone he is bored and alone again
he hits play on his tv and begins watching his show from the same spot it was at before
george wakes up in a large clean modern house
he is all alone
we get the feeling that he hired someone to decorate his house
it is very nice but doesnt seem personal to him at all
it feels new with all the gadgets but a little cold
on the kitchen table is a stack of scripts he is supposed to read
george hits balls in his home batting cage
then we see him driving golf balls inside there
in the background we see his modern space ship looking house
it is enormous
george walks into a fancy steam filled shower
george drives his large black mercedes
george gets out of his car and walks towards the tower
two college students walk over
hey george can i get a picture with you
lets do it
one of the college students put his arm around george while the other takes the picture
can i get one
they take the picture
youre the man
we love all your movies even the last one
tell your friends
george sits in the doctors office staring at the photos of the doctor with his beautiful young children
doctor stevens enters and sits down
he takes a deep breath
i like those lunestas
they really put me to sleep without giving me the sleeping pill hangover i get from the restorils
i try not to take them too often
just when i know i have to get up early
george there are some irregularities in your blood work
georges face turns white
he knows what this means
the doctor keeps talking but the sound keeps coming in and out it is now all a jumble of words
we see photos of the doctors family his graduation certificates files of other cases odd doctors office art a picture of him skiing with his family
he keeps talking but now we hear nothing
music up my shits fucked up by warren zevon george walks down the stairs towards the parking lot in a daze
an asian girl and her mother and brother see him and start screaming
oh my god
can you take a picture with me
she puts her arm around him
her little brother jumps in too
you are the funniest
george drives home
we hear the voice of his doctor in his head
its a rare blood disorder
in the family of hodgkins disease
we really dont have a treatment for it
there are things we can try
theyre all very experimental in nature
i dont understand what this means
i think you need to hope for the best and prepare for the worst
is there someone who can help you get your affairs in order
ira a year old works at the deli counter along with chuck a large sweet looking year old deli counter lifer and gail a very skinny very old straight talking
humorless woman in her fifties
ira is in the middle of a very long conversation with a middle aged woman
is the turkey organic
well what does organic mean
it means theres no additives or preservatives and its hormone free
are there additives or preservatives in the food they feed the turkey
i dont know maam
i heard that because turkeys are fatty birds mercury gets stuck in their fat
my daughter in law she ate turkey and then she had a miscarriage
i havent heard about that
but i may not be informed enough to comment
well youre not a doctor so you shouldnt comment
you are correct i am not a doctor
ira and chuck are preparing trays of food
you should come see me do stand up tonight at the comedy and magic club
i cant go through that again man that was painful
that was five months ago
ive gotten a lot better
they pay you yet
nah not there
i just hang out and hope somebody doesnt show
wow is there anyway for you to
be lower in show business
i dont know if you could even say youre in show business
why dont you just fucking settle down and enjoy this gig
this is a sweet situation
the moneys good youve got health insurance
dude i know you like it here but if i have to work here another year i would kill myself
in that case when we bury you does it have to be in some kind of jew cemetery
next to al jolson or some shit
i need the support
im funnier than you
and im not even that funny
i would go if i was paying to see me
ill pay your cover charge
okay well you better be good because im bringing a date
laughters the ultimate lubricant
an otis redding song is playing as george walks around his house in a daze not sure how to process this
he doesnt call anybody
theres nobody in sight
we see images of him thinking about the unthinkable and the life hes lead
he sits in his office surrounded by photos of himself at difference ages
it builds to a sequence of him going through stacks of old photos and watching videos of himself reviewing his life trying to make sense of what it all meant
we see clips of his good movies and his last bad movie
on the wall is a poster of a buddy film which shows him and another famous comedian
on screen home video of george at college
george is hanging out with his friends
they are acting goofy having the time of their lives
george looks very young skinny and carefree
life has never been better
they play a ridiculous drinking game and laugh uproariously
another image we see a very young george performing stand up on late night with david letterman
hes so young and naive he seems like a completely different person
angle on george watching silently
he has no idea what to make of this journey of his
ira sits with one of his roommates leo who is also an aspiring comedian
they sit across from each other kicking around joke ideas they have trying to write new ones
we see an entire pitch session play out
iras joke pitches are all over the place
he clearly hasnt figured out what his stage persona is yet
i was thinking about doing something about how im not good looking and im not bad looking
im just good looking enough that if i had a good personality it could put me over the top
if that was the case
yeah something about how the uglier you are the better the personality you need
and the hotter you are the stupider you can be
i had a joke once about how you never see incredibly hot blonde homeless women
because someone will always take care of that kind of woman
that woman could be the dumbest person on earth and she will survive in this world
maybe something like
you can be hot and stupid and survive in the world
and you can be smart and ugly and survive in the world
the people who have trouble are the stupid ugly people
that could work
let me keep that one because i thought of most of it
thats not cool
i came up with the concept
what do you got
lets work on what you have
ive got nothing in the notebook
i got drunk last night
but i need material because i just got spots at the improv
budd saw me and approved me
how could they make you a regular
i got turned down twice
theyre only going to let in one chubby caustic jew so i think youre fucked
their other roommate mark walks in waves a check at them
you see this check that i got from my tv show for an episode
there was another one of these on the kitchen counter
did you see it
no we didnt see it
just dont leave those things laying around
i wouldnt leave it around if they didnt give me so many
they give it to me every episode
dont throw it in our face that youre on a shitty show
i wouldnt if it was a shitty show and not what time magazine called insightful and delightful
i thought you were moving out
i decided i like it here
living with you guys keeps me grounded
i dont want to be the guy living in the house on the hill
even though i could afford it
hey i saw that girl comic you like who lives upstairs
i invited her in
shes in our apartment
ive never even talked to her
i just gave her quarters at the washing machine
you were right she is pretty mousy and sexy
you gotta talk to her
i need time
i have a three month plan
ill give you ten days for your three month plan then i am going to fuck her
you cant just leave that laying around
starting right now
mark is talking to daisy an alternative feeling dark haired girl in her early twenties
his television show is on the the thing about working on a sitcom is its weeks a year so i can do stand up the rest of the year
but now people want to see me because they see me on a tv show so i am kind of a draw
have you seen the show
i dont own a tv
well i think you can download it to an ipod
ira walks in
hey ira this is daisy
hows it going
nice to meet you
i think i gave you quarters once
ira walks over to the kitchen area takes out a paper cup
he pours some orange juice without looking and the paper cup falls over and spills all over the counter
mark looks horrified
nervously joking dont worry ill just lick it off the counter
ira starts wiping up the oj with a rag
leo is on stage performing his act doing well
angle on ira watching both amused and jealous
a magician and the emcee walks over to him
schneider didnt show up so you can do ten minutes after leo
dont go long because i have to load pigeons into my suit
i have to let them out or theyll die
im not fucking around
so when you get the light dont go long
youve got one minute
angle on leo on stage doing a few more jokes
a manager walks over to ira
george simmons just got here he wants to go up
well put you on after george
well how long is he going to do
i dont know
last night he did five minutes
last week he did an hour
fieil do what he wants to do
well what about the magician
he just loaded his pigeons
he said i have to get off in ten minutes
ill have him unload the pigeons
just be ready
leo finishes his set to huge applause then comes off stage
that was good right
some of the new stuff worked
i just got bumped by george simmons
are you serious
shit ive got a spot at the improv i cant hang out damn
a lot of times you hear about going to a comedy club and someone exciting shows up
i wont lie to you that usually never happens
but tonight it is happening
ladies and gentleman you know him from movie credits to go here george simmons
george walks on stage
the place goes crazy
he does some of his normal routine and the audience laughs and is very appreciative
as george continues his act it starts getting darker and darker until he is talking about death and the lack of meaning in it all
what does it mean
sometimes life makes perfect sense
and then you come
hes killing the crowd
jesus i cant follow this shit
after completely losing the crowd and some minor confrontations with audience members he exits the stage
life isnt all about laughs
crazy shit happens
youve got to be nice to each other
you never know whats going to happen
ira passes george as he heads onto the stage
sorry i sucked it up out there
at least they are well rested for you
ira takes the stage
he starts trying to do his act but he is unsure of himself and unable to figure out how to take the weird energy of the room and spin it
to his advantage
he basically bombs
we reveal chuck and his date watching looking miserable
im not good looking
im not bad looking
im just in the middle
and if i had a personality that was jut good enough it would put me over the edge
the joke fails
we reveal george also watching him bomb amused by his struggle
he sees something he likes in ira
ira walks to his car
in the spot next to him is an enormous suburban suv parked in a spot meant for compact cars
it is so close to iras car that it isnt possible to open the door
he hears some banging and odd wails from in the car
ira knocks on the window
we see that george is sitting in his car in a world of pain
hes clearly been crying
the knock startles him
he turns to ira
i didnt mean to disturb you
i just cant open my door
theres no room
oh im sorry
let me pull out
george pulls the car back ten feet
calling to ira hey man you had some funny shit tonight
man that audience hated you
they really did not like you
they liked your buddy who looked exactly like you but was funnier
man thats going to haunt you
youre going to wake up in six months and think about this night
well ill probably bomb worse tomorrow and forget about this one
im just fucking with you
you had some funny jokes in there
well obviously im a
i grew up on your shit man
george just stares at him
only two hundred people saw that tonight
ill see you later
george pulls out turns the car around and as he passes by ira he steers his car as if hes going to run him down and starts screaming
youre gonna die
im gonna kill you
then he smiles at ira and drives off
this is the greatest thing thats ever happened to him
full screen computer we see a comedy short made by leo
its very funny
holy shit you got seven hundred thousand hits in four days
they put it on the main page at youtube and it exploded
which would be awesome if someone would pay me
the phone rings
hey is this ira
who is this
oh my gosh
hey how is it going
i thought you and leo were pretty funny last night and i have to do this corporate gig for apple computers in a couple of days and i thought you
guys could write me some jokes
what kind of jokes
leo passes by in the background
we see ira decide not to include him in this job offer
i dont know about computers and shit
i could mainly do my act but they like it if you talk about them a little
where do you want me to send em
what is your email
i will send you my fax and email and all that
long silence i almost just changed my mind
you got to change that
ira hangs up and turns to his friends
that was george simmons
he wants me to write jokes for him
that is awesome
you are so lucky
are you gonna get to meet him
i dont know but he is gonna send me his email address
we are gonna have his email address
i have to send him the link to my short
let me get in there a little more
ira is writing jokes
the camera follows the letters being typed on the computer screen as he types
always erase your web history
i had a girlfriend hit history and see eleven hundred porn sites that i visited in an hour
jonah sticks his head in
i got one but you have to tell him its mine
the best thing about leopard is it lets you watch a porno write a porno shoot a porno and order a porno all at the same time
and you guys made that possible
we see quick images of him typing and printing
he is writing an enormous amount of jokes
way more than george will ever need
writing typing re writing in pen then re typing etc
ira hesitates then hits send
ira is asleep
the clock says noon
the phone rings
he answers it groggy
theres some funny shit in here
not a bad ratio of good jokes to shit
i just want to give you a lot of choices
too many choices
i dont like reading that much
i need like ten good jokes
im a little mad you made me read that many to get to ten
but thanks for doing it
oh it was fun to try to write in your voice
i spent the whole night pretending i was you
so you cried yourself to sleep
so you whacked off three times last night
dont worry ill get you some money
is five hundred good
im leaving at four tomorrow to go to the gig
you want to come check it out see if your shit works
close up on their curtains as they wait for george to pull up
can we go outside and meet him
no you cant
because then we look like fans
maybe hes seen my show
he doesnt watch your show
youre show is for eight year olds
its a family show he doesnt watch that shit
ill just go outside and pretend i n washing my car
the limo pulls up outside
i feel like my little girl is going to the prom
the door opens ira gets in
how you doing you ready for this
yeah thisll be fun
i think im going to have you go on before me to warn them up
you dont have to do that
what if i bomb
hey if you bomb theyll just be more excited to see me
theyll be so glad your not on stage any more
then if you do well theyll be ready for me
either way youre helpful
the limo pulls up to a private jet
ira is shocked
a moment later theyre picking up speed to take off
george seems really relaxed
nothing registers that the jet is going faster and faster and taking off
as theyre having a conversation ira seems really freaked out
ira pretends he isnt
i like this joke about watching porn and making porn all at the same time
that was a good one
turning white from oh good
yeah i thought youd like that one
i was really happy with that one
you want something to eat
i had them bring chinese on the plane
iras eyes widen
he likes this way of life
dave from apple is walking george and ira into the room
its a giant room that holds a thousand people at banquet tables
on stage sting is finishing up a set
this is a huge corporate event
okay what do you want them to say when he introduces you
do you have any credits he should mention
long beat uh
i dont really have any credits
maybe you could just say ive been working on apples for so long my first one weighed more than i did
and just say hes a friend of mine and i think hes funny
iras on stage doing his act
he tells two jokes that dont do very well
and then he panics and does the joke about jerking off and shooting a movie all at the same time
angle on george shaking his head amused that he panicked and did one of the jokes he sold to him
cut to the wings of the stage
iras walking off stage
what the fuck is that
you did three of the jokes that you wrote for me
they just wanted jokes about computers
thats why i hired you to write jokes about computers
ira takes out the long list of jokes hes written
but theres a lot more
the first three on this page
you didnt think they would work but i think they will
you should just try them
they better kill im getting paid a hundred thousand dollars for this
are you serious
angle on dave on stage
ladies and gentleman george simmons
george does a few apple jokes that do kill and then he segues into his normal act
when he wants to be he is a great performer
george and ira sit on the plane on the way back
well be on the ground in a half hour
want to go to a bar
do something fun
i like fun
heres a grand for the jokes and the gig
even though you should be paying me after that
iras eyes widen
thats the most money ive ever made doing anything in comedy
then this is an exciting moment
well i didnt make a hundred grand like you
i feel nothing
i remember when a grand was the most exciting thing in the world
id go to red lobster and go nuts
now its just numbers in a bank account
you made a thousand bucks
george and ira enter
people are very excited to see george
they give him a nice table
george and ira talk to two women mandy and dawn
they both seem really into george
ira feels kind of left out
george focuses on mandy flirting and preparing her to go home with him
the other girl is now talking to a very uncomfortable ira
she is not into it
hey lets all go back to my house
yeah that sounds like a
music is playing
everybody is drinking
mandy is doing some weird sort of sexy dance for george
this house is so big
its bigger than the college i went to
oh theres a whole other wing that you wouldnt even know existed unless you went through this door
i want to see i want to see
george and mandy disappear
ira and dawn are left alone
you are very pretty
i have a boyfriend
nothing is going to happen
i didnt say anything was going to happen
i just said you were pretty
how do you even know i wanted something to happen
i hope she doesnt take a long time
george is having sex with mandy
i cant believe im having sex with davey
he cant believe hes having sex with you
ira and dawn are watching one of georges films
neither looks very happy or comfortable
hey mandy thought you left so she left
sorry that kind of stuff happens when you have a big house
oh well then i guess i better get going
you dont have to go
im just saying that she left
i think she left her purse in the other wing
come with me lets go get it
ira watches this astonished
did ira tell you i have a room with all the classic pinball machines and video games
that sounds awesome
yeah i got galaga
lets go check it out
george looks over his shoulder at ira as if to say a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do
to ira hey dont go ill be back in a second
ira is now watching the end of the movie by himself
george sticks his head in
that girl left
you want to talk to me while i try to go to sleep
ira doesnt know what to make of this
i guess so
george is in bed under the covers comfortably laying on his pillow
ira sits in an easy chair located right next to the bed
did you have sex with both of those girls
im afraid i did
it was just so clear that you were not going to get it done
i figured you wouldnt mind
that is crazy
that is super crazy
it was great
it was crazy great
how can that even happen
i guess i understand the first one but why would the second one do it
you probably stink of the first girl
well we took a steam shower together
she had never seen a steam shower before i told her she should enjoy it
she wouldnt fool around with me because she said she had a boyfriend
she told me that too but she says i was on her and her boyfriends list of people she was allowed to screw
youd be surprised how many women have me on that list
i should get going
just talk to me before i fall asleep
i dont like being alone
you should crash in one of the rooms
youre too drunk to drive home
i wont try to fuck you i just fucked two women and im kind of done
i may have to whack it in your guest room
whack away i dont give a shit
hey you were funny tonight
i could see how you could get good
that was fun
it was rare that i get to play to more than twenty five people
ive never played for a thousand
it s kind of easier because even if two hundred like me it sounds like a lot
i do feel bad for you because no matter how hard you try youll never be as funny as me
why would you say that
did your dad crack you on the head when you were a kid
my dad always seemed annoyed with me
hed always crack me on the head
you would not see it coming
i spent my whole childhood trying to make my dad laugh so he wouldnt smack me
but he was an awesome guy
he was the coolest
he just got annoyed with me
do you like your parents
they cant be that bad because youre not that funny
and always broke
they got divorced ten years ago but they both act like it just happened last week
they hate each other
they always put me in the middle of it
i always wanted them to say we dont want you to suffer through this so were just going to handle it ourselves
they never would do it
they would always make me feel their pain all the time
i would never do that for my kids
because its like they
and no matter how many times i tell them to leave me out of it they never do
ira notices that george is very close to falling asleep
ill let you crash
no keep going
tell me about your day job
knows hes a sleeping pill at this point i work at a supermarket at the deli counter
i hate it but the moneys actually pretty good
better than youd think
but id rather do comedy full time if i could
the camera pulls back as ira continues to talk and we begin to hear george snoring as ira continues to talk anyway
george walks into the guest room where ira is sleeping
hey man you want to make me breakfast
do you know how to cook anything
okay lets have some eggs
while ira is cooking george takes a lot of pills
what are you doing man
are those vitamins
what do you got
ive got some crazy blood disease
they think im going to die in six months to a year
some weird thing almost nobody has it
all these are experimental
are you fucking with me
thats not funny man
no im telling you the truth
i never heard that before
that would be a big deal
i havent told anybody yet
i dont think im going to
youre not going to tell anybody
you told me
well its easier with you because i dont know you
i dont feel weird around you
i dont want to be treated like a guy whos going to die
i dont know man
i dont think you want to go through this alone
i think youve got to tell people
actually the reason why i only told you is i need you to do me a favor
i cant imagine suffering through the final stages of this
i was going to ask you if you would be willing
to euthanize me
what does that mean
i figured if i found someone that nobody knew that was a stranger they could get away with it and i wouldnt have to suffer
i got a gun that is untraceable
and a silencer
and i thought maybe tonight i would take a bunch of sleeping pills and when i slept you would put a bullet in my head
i cant do that
ill give you fifty thousand dollars in cash
youd be doing me a favor
it would be the kindest thing you could ever do for somebody
fifty thousand dollars
can i at least take a little time to think about it
holy shit you would do it
you were literally thinking about doing it
youre an asshole
im an asshole you were about to kill me
for fifty grand
thats not even a lot of money
i just got nervous so i was delaying saying no
you basically just told me that you were willing to be a murderer
while youre cooking me eggs
thats not cool man
you told me youre going to die and you want me to euthanize you
i almost had a heart attack
well i actually am sick
and im not going to survive
dont do this
my friends do this all the time
they trick me and then they trick me again
im very gullible
dont do it
im not putting you on man
just dont tell anyone
i mean that
i dont want people to know about this
i dont want to feel weird
ira nods okay
are you religious
does that give you any comfort
do you really think im going to sit here and have a theological conversation with you
maybe later father mulcahy
the three friends mark ira leo smoke pot and have what they think is a deep conversation
thats so sad
if it was me i would tell everyone
then everyone would kiss my ass
and take care of me
tell me how much they love me
wipe my ass when i had to go to the bathroom
theyd be crying and sad and that would make me feel really good
he doesnt want to be that guy
he picked up two girls at a bar
then he had sex with his
and then he came out and had sex with mine
in front of you
so being terminally ill makes you a cock blacker
no what im saying is
hes so lost right now that hes hiding from the world
and hes trying to distract himself by doing stand up and having sex with a lot of women
and he doesnt want anyone to know but me
because he doesnt know me
so he doesnt give a shit
thats kind of insulting
no i think we had kind of an instant connection
the other roommate jay walks by
you fucked him
shut up jay
jay keeps walking
i feel like hes crying out for help and i can help him
hes made us so happy in our lives this is our chance to do something from him during this time
theres a lot of wisdom we can take from this
what hes going through
we can apply it to our lives
like how to bang two chicks in the same night even though you have a terminal disease
no what is life all about
what is important
how should we decide to live this precious life
reveal that mark is crying
dont talk about this shit when were high
it really freaks me out and it makes me sad and it scares me
i dont want to talk about this shit
thats why we should talk about it
you cant run from it man
this could make us into better people
this is an opportunity
i dont want to talk about this shit until im
im years old
well im going to fucking learn something
mark cries even more
when my grandfather died we were in a room with no windows
and they said he was dead
and there was a candle
and it started flickering like he was blowing it out
but there were no windows
we all thought that was him going to heaven
you have to go through fire to get to heaven
that wasnt him going to heaven that was him going to hell
fuck you guys
i was trying to open up
ill never do it again
youre just being mean because im making twenty five thousand dollars an episode
george is bored playing guitar
he picks up the phone dials
ira answers the phone
you want to see if we can get on stage somewhere
see quick moments of ira on stage at the improv doing a set
then george does a set tears down the house
george and a few of his friends are playing a famous rock song for fun
but they are very good
the music continues through the following sequence
george and ira are eating with several famous comedians shooting the shit having a good time
george and ira are waiting at the parking valet
the car pulls up
as they get in i was thinking about it
i could throw you some money every week for coming up with new jokes for me
maybe you can organize them in the computer keep track of what im doing
what do you want to pay me
they close the doors drive off
ill throw you a week
okay that could work
we can tell that this amount of money could change iras life
george and ira are writing jokes
ira keeps pitching premises rough joke ideas that george instantly makes ten times better off the top of his head
we shoot this process for real with multiple cameras and try to catch lightning in a bottle
i was thinking maybe you should do some material about what youre going through being sick
there could be something really powerful and it would mean a lot to people that you would share that with them
im just doing stand up to have fun forget about it on stage
theres nothing funny about that
it could be classic stuff
for the ages
fuck classic stuff
idont give a shit what people think of my shit when im dead
why dont you wait till youre about to die and then you do a bit about it
ill bet youre about to die shit will be funnier than my about to die shit
george and ira are doing sets again
george is making a phoney phone call on a speaker phone
grandmother voice i ordered your roast beef
and normally its delicious
but this time i paid a price
im very sorry maam
what if you come in and i give you a free sandwich
grandmother voice well thats very nice of you
but i have one question for you
can i get two sandwiches
george motions for ira to do something
get off the fucking phone
dont run up my fucking bill
ira starts slapping his hands together
george screams in pain
are you okay
grandmother voice this is a family matter
he can hit me if he wants
hes my grandson and i love him
now may i give you my name so you have it on file so i can get my free sandwich
k a c a h a k r e k k u c t a r s u t a r g m s
did you get that
can you say it back to me
he walks through the house finds george in bed
for the first time he seems sick
are you all right
no i had a bad night last night
i was sweating though the sheets couldnt stop
so i got up watched half of a season of the wire and then i slept till
what time is it now
its three in the afternoon
i wanted to get up and do something
but i dont think i have it in me
i may just go back to bed
well do you need anything
yeah i need all sorts of things
but nothing you can get me
you should go up anyway
you were in a groove the other night you dont want to get rusty
im doing the late shift at the deli counter
how long you gonna keep that job for
im paying you good money
what if someone you perform in front of goes into ralphs and sees you cutting turkey
i know i just want to be safe make sure i can pay my bills
i dont like to be nervous about that shit
i wasnt like you
i had a different theory
youve got to spend money to make money
nothing makes you work harder than being in debt
maybe we should go buy a corvette
thatll make you try to be funnier
so how much notice are you giving me
im not giving you any notice
im just quitting
youre supposed to give notice
thats what people do
why would i give you notice
im not trying to stay in ralphs good graces
im not trying to preserve my good standing at ralphs
im just quitting
you dont quit and then keep working for two weeks

i wish i could help you but ill kill myself if i keep working here
its not what i want to do
maybe gail can cover my shifts
gail cant work weekends and my kids birthday is this weekend
what am i supposed to do
i dont know
get someone to cover from a different ralphs
there are thousands of them in southern california
no one else can scoop macaroni into a bowl
im not the linchpin that keeps ralphs from falling into chaos
youre an asshole
you always thought you were slumming it here
go tell your tucking fart jokes
get the fuck out of here before i kick the shit out of you
you know what
im glad you said that because i was about to tell you i could work this weekend
whats your problem
i didnt say anything bad about you i just said i didnt want to work for ralphs anymore
chuck takes a step to ira like hes going to hit him
ira steps back a few feet
ill tell dave
ill tell dave
i tried to do this politely
the thanks i get
ira walks out the store
as he walks out he turns to a lady in her s at the register
see you phyllis
ira sees daisy walking out as hes walking into the apartment complex
he takes a deep breath then hey daisy
she doesnt i know
i was gonna try to hunt down tickets to see wilco at the greek theatre
you want to come
are you into them at all
i would love to come
that would be amazing
ill call you with the details
hopefully ill be able to get seats which will not require high powered binoculars
i dont care where the seats are
i just like to close my eyes and listen to the music at concerts perfect
then i can play you their live album in my car and trick you into thinking we have front row seats
laughing uncomfortably that wont work
that wasnt funny at all
im gonna leave while im ahead right now
he walks away
ira walks into georges house
ira walks into georges bedroom
he hears something pokes his head in
in the dark he can barely see george making phoney calls by himself
ira listens for awhile not sure what to make of this
george doesnt see him
speaking like an old i was robbed
one second youre walking down the street with your visa card having a grand old time and then youve got a fucking gun in your mouth
whats the number of the card maam
i dont know
the thief has the card why dont you ask the thief the number of the card
george hangs up the phone
he starts dialing
as a texan ah yes i came into your comedy club tonight and i was very offended by the performer
i did not pay good money to have the so called comedian shake my wifes hand then smell it and say did you have fish for dinner
that is not my idea of entertainment
ira leaves the room feeling like hes intruded on a private moment
george and ira are eating
i was thinking you need to tell someone about your situation
iaaa dont want to do that
i feel like maybe youre holding everything in and i can understand why you dont want to deal with it because why would anyone want to deal with it
but i bet you have a lot of unfinished business with your friends
wouldnt it make you feel a lot better to get your affairs in order
what do people do at this moment dont they have to do stuff
i dont want to do anything
i just want to be in the moment and live every day the best i can
as soon as i confront it with everybody everythings changed and i cant get back
everything has changed
at some point youre going to get really sick and you need your friends and family around you
im sure theres a lot of business estate issues i dont know
maybe youll feel better than if you just deal with everything
where are your parents
p y parents would drop dead if i told them what was happening
theyre in their s
they dont have to go through this
ill make sure they find out at the last possible second
i dont think i do
i thought i did
i got a lot of people i know shoot the shit with fuck around with
but i realized when this happened im not close to anyone
i had no one to call
my friendships are hollywood friendships
when i was lying in bed i couldnt think of one person i wanted to share this with
maybe its me maybe i never got close to anybody
i think if you talk to people youd find out a lot of people care about you
youre kind of old already i mean compared to me
im sure you touched a lot of peoples lives
you cant spend the rest of your days making phoney phone calls alone in your room
the only reason i did that was because i couldnt sleep
and i had no one to call
well maybe thats the problem
maybe if you told more people youd have more people to call
you cant just talk to me about it i dont know what the fuck im talking about
youre the first person ive known whos sick
im not good at it
eyes beginning to well youve given me diarrhea im nervous about you and im in over my head
his eyes begin to well dont cry in front of me man
i cant start that
i cant have you do that
george really begins to cry
please dont do that
tears streaming down his i wont do it i promise man
ira wipes the tears from his face
new tears immediately come out
that was first and last time
im not even crying anymore
youre still crying
tears coming down i dont think i am
i think im not anymore
im not sure what youre talking about
okay as long as we got that straight
george takes a napkin and puts it over his face
im sorry george
i really dont know what to do i dont know how to help you
his face still in the no youre right
i really should tell some people
it just sucks man
it just sucks
and theyre going to feel so bad i dont even want to look at them and tell them
id rather drop dead
of a heart attack and have someone else make the calls
i have to make those calls
this is a nightmare
this is a total nightmare
do you want me to call them and tell them whats going on
i was hoping you were gonna say no
ira is on the phone
there is a paper with a bunch of numbers in front of him
into the phone hi this is ira im a friend of georges
he asked me to call you
his roommates are making a commotion outside
ira covers the receiver
will you guys shut the fuck up
shut the fuck up
ira slam the door
into phone im sorry
i have some news about george
george sits with three comedians
they are all laughing and telling old sex stories from georges younger days
ira sits with them and listens and laughs along
so i left the phone off the hook so he could hear me doing it
thats very gay
no it was a buddy thing
it was very heterosexual
admit it you were masturbating
of course i was whacking it
what else am i gonna do not whack it
and i kept making her talk and say crazy shit just to make him laugh
i think at one point you said say my hog is the biggest youve ever seen
and then there is this long pause
thats a bad sign
if it was big at all she wouldnt have paused
remember you used to have that joke about how you used to only date midgets because your dick looked bigger in their little hands
they all laugh
yeah you used to get all the girls man
suddenly the air is out of the room and it is awkward and sad
george is talking to an ex manager and his wife
and i feel horrible about it but the truth is i was having some issues with gambling and you were doing so well and so i took a million dollar
check you got in from the studio and i used it to clear up some debts
and i did it with the intention of paying you right back before you noticed
but you never noticed and i just never got around to paying you back
allen covert yells at george for abandoning him
you fucking blew us off
george is talking to his sister lisa
you have to tell mom and dad
i will tell them but right at the end
i dont want them to go through all this
i cant put them through this
i wish i wasnt so mad at you
i want to be there for you but i am so mad at you
i wish i was a better brother
you werent even a brother
you just left when i was a little kid
you left me there all alone and you never treated me like a sister again
you live so far away
i visited you in kansas a few years ago
that was six years ago and you were only there because you had a concert
my five year old has never even met you
george does not know what to say
and i wanted to bring her but then i thought she would just fall in love with you and get attached and then what
i didnt want to do that to her
george and ira talk in the kitchen while making beverages
thanks a lot pal
this is everything i didnt want to happen
its like being at my own funeral
afterwards youll be happy you did it
no i wont
george talks to a friend who rambles on and on talking about his own problems ignoring georges
it is such a tucked up situation
life is fucked
it makes no sense
well i really appreciate you coming by
this is why i cant be close with people
what is the point
well i really need to rest
the worst part is at night when the tv gets turned off and it is quiet
it was so good to see you
george stands up and exits the room
ira walks over
i think george is going to take a nap now
a different friend is talking about their own health issues
he goes on and on about his surgeries and treatments
george doesnt say a word
george is talking to bruce springsteen
youre about to merge with the eternal
were all going to die
no one gets out of here alive right
you lived five lives fucker
youre years old in my book
the fun youve had the money the adventures the women youve known
who wouldnt want to change places with you right new
i guess so but
you know what
there is no tomorrow no yesterday
only right now and its fucking beautiful
you need to shut the fuck up right now
have you been browsing the self help section at barnes and noble
is this what you say in between songs these days
im going to go right now and delete all your songs off my ipod
i didnt know what to say
i just got nervous
ira is talking george to sleep
hes gotten good at it
warren zevons dont let us get sick plays in the background
this is awful
i hate you for having me do this
you have to you have no choice
youre doing good
and youre almost done dont worry
well what are we going to do when its over when were done tomorrow
because then im not talking to anyone
i was thinking we should go skiing somewhere
youre still physically doing well and thats not going to last forever
you should do something active
go to colorado or tahoe or something
or do something crazy
go to switzerland or sweden or wherever they have mountains
i dont know i dont even ski but you do
maybe you should do something like that
ira notices george is falling asleep so he talks more quietly
hes gotten good at this
if its too hard we can just ski for an hour or two a day and then get drunk at the bar
you can hit on hot ski instructors and then i can masturbate in the room thinking about you fucking hot ski instructors
he thinks george is asleep so he walks out as he speaks
itll be fun to be in the mountain air fun to look at the mountains
maybe you shouldnt even be here
we can hang out there as long as you want i got nothing to do
ira closes the door
george is talking to laura a very pretty woman in her late thirties
laura is showing george a photo of her two daughters
thanks for coming down
you didnt have to do that i appreciate it
i wanted to i wanted to see you
im so sorry
im sorry for everything i did to you
you dont have to be sorry that was like years ago
everything worked out for the best
we see this hurts george
i screwed everything up
i could have been married to you now
dont do this
we couldve had a family
i dont have a family im all alone here
tearing up im so sorry
im so sorry for whats happening to you
you know maybe i deserve it
i screwed up the only good thing that ever happened in my life
i cheated on you
for no reason at all
just young and stupid
maybe i over reacted
i didnt have to leave you
yes you did
angle on ira sneaking a peak from the kitchen as he makes coffee
and the funny thing is
my husband he is on the road a lot for business
he did the same thing last year
did you leave him
i have kids now
see that was my mistake
i should have had some kids with you before i cheated
you were the one and only magic relationship in
she starts to cry
he does too
they cry forehead to forehead
theres never been anything like you before or since
i love chris but its not the same
its fine maybe it isnt even fine but we had something special
im so sorry
i really loved you
and i do love you
i love you too george
i wish there was something i could do
dont set me up for jokes like that
youre ruining the moment
ira comes home deep in the evening
hes eating some food
daisy walks out of marks bedroom dressed in marks long sleeve t shirt
shes clearly just had sex
hows it going
mark walks out in a bathrobe
oh im sorry
i thought you were sleeping at your boyfriends again tonight
i guess its been more than ten days
its been days
i gave you an extra
what are you guys talking about
dont worry about it it doesnt matter i dont give a shit
leo walks in the front door
i just fucking killed at the improv
bud freidman fucking loves me
leo realizes hes walked into the middle of an awkward moment
they said theyre gonna start giving me good spots on the weekends
ive been getting good weekend spots
well thats because they think if they book you george will show up
whats with you guys
you both want to fuck my mother too
what more do you want to do to me tonight
ira walks away
i really did kill
a beat did you guys just bone or something
im getting a little vibe here
its getting me excited
ira and daisy are having a heated conversation outside
so now youre with mark
youre his girl
i just went out with him one night
you got a lot accomplished in one night
how did this happen
he invited me to a taping of his show and we hit it off
must have been a great episode
i should get a job on a shitty show so i can use it as foreplay
what are you talking about
dont treat me like that
i am not treating you like anything
do what you want
i dont give a shit
ill go to wilco alone
what planet are you from
the one where everyone is perfect like you you judgemental fuck
how could you do that
i thought we were going out on a date
we are going on a date
i didnt plan it
am i not allowed to do stuff because were going out on a date
what the fucks the matter with you
i bought tickets to wilco and i worked all week to get a reservation at a place that doesnt normally let people like me eat there
i just didnt see this coming
yes youre right
you can do anything you want
im glad this fucking happened before i wasted the night with you
i didnt think you were that kind of person
that you would sleep with a guy like that
hes your roommate
you dont like him
no i think hes a pussyhound
well i didnt know that
thanks for the info
i wasnt trying to hurt you
it just happened
you got excited because hes the star of the show
you literally star fucked
yes youre right
give me a break
i dont even know you
ira goes into the house
mark is there
i told you i was going to give you days
that was three weeks ago
i thought you were joking
i didnt know she actually mattered to you
we talk about girls we want to fuck all the time
i just bought these two wilco tickets
i would but im going with tobey maguire
he wants me to play his younger brother in some movie
george and ira are skiing
there is no music no noise
it is very peaceful
george stops in a spot where he is surrounded in all directions by gorgeous majestic mountains
he looks around taking it all in
george and ira are watching videotapes of george doing stand up when he was much younger
hes really really funny
and very skinny with a much more pronounced new york accent
you know i never got married
i never had kids
i didnt get to do a lot of things i thought i would do
but i was pretty fucking funny right
come on are you kidding me
we all want to be you
most of my comic friends are just doing a bad impression of you
people love your shit
well i made a lot of people laugh
i guess thats something
its a lot
i guess so
they watch some more and we see a really happy young george getting big laughs with something really silly
look at that crazy motherfucker
george and ira start watching the act and laughing along like any audience member
george is singing a happy song with a bunch of musician friends like a lou reed velvet underground or ramones new york dolls clash warren zevon paul mccartney song
this music plays over the following montage
george walks around his grounds slowly
and one gets the sense hes never looked around and seen where he lives before
he likes it
george performs at the improv
we see him gesture to a woman that she can come up on stage and she hugs him
the crowd erupts
she runs back to her seat
george continues with his act
george and ira hike up a hill
i never understood why people hiked before
i think i get it now
george and ira have an uncomfortable dinner with georges angry sister lisa
george is in bed sleeping
ira starts sneaking out
george wakes up calls ira back to keep talking to him
george is walking around his yard at night
hes clearly never walked the grounds at night
he seems at peace
lisa and her husband are now over and george is talking to them and playing with her two year old boy
george is sitting with his parents
it is clear he recently told them about his situation and although there is sadness in the air they look happy to be close for the first time in a
george says something that makes his dad laugh
ira is asleep on the couch
george walks over with a bowl of ice cream
he whacks ira a few times trying to wake him up but ira keeps snoring
george sits down next to the sleeping ira and watches tv while eating his ice cream
george and ira play basketball
ira is awful
ira is making breakfast
george is all dressed for the day
what are you doing
im feeling good so im going to the doctor
youre not feeling good
no im feeling good
its kind of weirding me out
i dont feel sick at all and its scaring me
i feel like im just going to drop dead
am i not going to feel bad at all and then one day wake up dead
i dont want to get your hopes up
we put you on this experimental medication without much optimism but as of right now i dont see any traces of the disease in your blood work
i dont want to speak too soon but we may have beaten this thing
well what the fuck do i do now
iras eyes are wide with shock
oh my god oh my god
ira goes to hug george but its a very awkward moment
ira really wants a happy hug but george is instantly uncomfortable
george is sitting at his computer
ira is also seated
i really want to thank you for your help through this time
i was happy to help
well you didnt have to and you were really there for me
i was thinking maybe we should write a movie together
i feel like ive learned a lot and i wanna use this good place im in right now to do something really creative
i would pay you certainly
i make you know about a million dollars to write a script
i cant give you half but maybe one hundred two hundred grand but well figure it out
yeah well figure it out
i thought a lot about my work when i was sick and im in sort of a strange place career wise because im normally the goofy funny guy and i
dont know if people are expecting a change from me
and i think people are expecting me to evolve and its important to evolve before they make a point of asking me why im not evolving
its always good to keep breaking new ground
is that something they taught you at the deli
im not asking you for your advice i just though we could start trying to come up with an idea
well im gonna start thinking
im really happy for you
are you freaking out right now
its very strange
its gonna take me a few days to process it but its a gift and im going to treat it that way
i learned a lot from being sick and its gonna help me make some good choices and be a good person from now on
ira is eating with his fairly young mom and his step father and he thanked me for helping him and i really think i was a help during this time
im not saying thats why he got better but he definitely had good energy and i hear that helps your immune system
hes going to pay you two hundred thousand dollars to write a movie script
i dont know he said one or two hundred thousand
one or two hundred thousand
thats pretty vague
thats a wide range
id push him toward two hundred thousand if i were you
thank you for the advice bob
thats very helpful
this is good because now you can help with your sisters college tuition
what are you talking about
your younger sister got accepted to boston university but as you know your father and i arent in the position to pay for it
so i have to
i just stopped working at a supermarket two weeks ago
im trying to create some financial stability for myself
the first time i make any real money i cant just give it to her
well thats very selfish
well you guys went on a cruise to greece last year
maybe you shouldnt have gone and saved for her college education
oh so after all weve done for you we cant have any fun
we should never take a vacation
i had to drop out of college after two years because you couldnt pay for it
now i have to pay for hers
let her figure it out
let her get a job
i didnt realize i raised such a selfish boy
when i was young i would have done anything for my family
then sell your house
move into a smaller house
use the extra money to pay for her college
or tell her to work for a year or two make some money then she can pay for her own college
no one helped me out im just digging out from under now
dont get so high up on your horse with all your hollywood friends
i dont like what youre turning into
one good thing happens to me in my entire life and you have to try and take it away and ruin it
i dont even know where you came from
dont bother showing up for thanksgiving
thanksgiving is just for families
ira is on his computer
leo and mark are watching
typing as he talks hey george were doing an orphans thanksgiving tomorrow night want to come
its just for us losers who dont have any family to eat with
hes not gonna email back
hes never gonna want to eat thanksgiving with us
the computer bings
the guys scream in delight
reading email sure
do you need me to bring anything
types back oclock at my apartment
bring wine that we cant afford
the computer bings
reading email thats pretty much all wine on earth
see you then
email back and say trying to make a joke if you can bring that hot chick from your last movie
we definitely have room for her
well then maybe just bring grain alcohol then
they all start laughing
the computer bings again
reading it hey faggots i know what youre doing
stop emailing me
its not amusing anymore
they all start high fiving
he called us faggots
mark and leo are doing the cooking
there a few other comedians male and female floating around the apartment
ira watches the parade on tv
daisy walks up site down next to ira
what have you been up to
i havent seen you at the improv
ive just been busy
will you excuse me
ira gets up walks out of the room
george walks up rings the bell
inside the apartment he hears a bit of a scuffle as if the friends are fighting over who can open the door
leo opens the door sweaty with a welt on his face
how are you
come on in
then mark appears from the side also sweaty with a welt on his neck
come on in
everyone is seated around the table
its very awkward due to georges presence
it seems to suck the air out of the room
were really glad you could come have thanksgiving with us
its a big thrill
its weird i feel like the old guy in the room
when i started out i was always the young guy
its strange how fast you become the old guy
and i feel exactly the same
well you dont know us but youre with friends and admirers
i know you ive watched your show
its a good show
you dont have to lie to him
he knows its not good
no its good its cute
i like it
i know its not that funny but they do slip in some funny shit in there every now and again
dont be ashamed its good
but what about that girl on the show
how old is she
tell me shes
i feel bad
i dont want to tell you what i did watching that show
are you serious
no shes actually
now i dont feel so bad
their weird friend futoran pipes up
i heard you were sick and now youre better
is that like really
whats that like
its kinda like
you know after you kind of liked everybody
but then it went away
its like that
did you think you were gonna go to heaven
did you count up your sins
i dont believe in any of that stuff but i was hoping i was headed somewhere
i felt like i was
i think you just wind up in the dirt
come on futoran were about to eat
well its easy to think that way until youre headed for the dirt
then your mind opens up a little bit you know
maybe its desperation or maybe you just start to see more of the big plan
luckily i got a little more time before i find out
daisy pops her head into the room
may i say the prayer
everyone nods yes
everyone hold hands
thank you for the gifts this year
thank you for this
and thank you for that
and hopefully next year ill get to screw that girl on marks show
all our dreams will come true
you guys will get an apartment with less pubic hair on the toilet seat youll be able to afford a maid
maybe next year you guys can get a better celebrity than me
maybe wolf blitzer will come
i also pray that no one put their balls on this turkey im kind of scared you guys are about to give me salmonella poisoning
i know this orphans thanksgiving its just a normal thanksgiving for you guys but its a very special one for me
im very glad to be here
im not that glad to be here with you but i thank you for having me
im sure it will be very memorable for you
now lets find out what leos balls taste like
everyones sitting down watching the football game
george motions to ira and then looks at daisy as if to say is that the girl you used to like
points at ira this guy wrote me some funny jokes for that mac gig
i asked for some jokes and he sent me about a hundred
points at leo this guy sent me jack shit
if you want to succeed you need a work ethic like ira over here
why wouldnt i have sent you jokes
you didnt ask me for jokes
sure i did
i asked you and ira to write me jokes and you flaked
leos eyes widen with anger
to daisy ira wrote this joke about leopard it was really funny
do the joke ira
i dont want to right now
it was like whats great about
leopard is you can watch a porno write a porno shoot a porno and order a porno all at the same time
this guys fucking funny
leo jumps up suddenly and walks out of the room without saying anything
ira watches him go concerned
to daisy and ira you guys look like a cute couple you should go out
well the truth is we had a date but i went out with mark first and he broke it off
i didnt expect you to blurt it out like that
that was very honest of you
if i didnt go out with every girl one of my friends slept with
let me put it another way
if none of my friends went out with girls i went out with none of them would have gotten laid
so are you guys dating now
this is making me uncomfortable
the whole thing it makes me uncomfortable
you guys are young why are you taking everything so seriously
as someone whos been through a lot recently let me tell you something
the worst thing you can do is hold grudges and be judgmental
everyones making mistakes everyones screwing up
you guys are cute together
george points at mark
i know that marks not good in bed
dont tell me he was a good lay
he cant have a big dick
look at ira
hes gotta have a thick dick
actually i have a really skinny vagina so im not really into thick
she can take a joke shes not sensitive
i think im falling in love with both of you
im gonna walk away now causing an awkward moment that will be followed by a true moment filled with chemistry
im walking away now
let the awkwardness begin
george walks out of the room
my brothers going to freak out that i met davey
to ira did you go to the wilco show
i actually scalped them and made a hundred bucks
well at last you didnt lose any money on the deal
im sorry i got so upset with you because it shows you how much i like you which is weird because weve hardly spoken
i understand all of that
well attraction is all about smells pheromones
well you smell right to me
daisy smiles at ira just as leo stomps back into the room
he charges right up to ira pissed off
youre a fucking prick youre a piece of shit thief motherfucker
you stole a job from me you stole my joke
you stole his joke
the moment is ruined
ira doesnt know what to say
leo pulls ira into the other room and goes off on him
he asked for me to write jokes too and you didnt tell me
i didnt think you would want to
why wouldnt i want to
what i dont like money
i dont like private jets
im sorry its just i needed the gig
and you are doing so much better than me
i guess i just wanted this for myself
it wasnt yours to keep for yourself
you lied to me
and it was fucked up
and i am sorry
i dont know what to say
dont say anything
just get your shit and get out of the apartment
are you serious
you dont get let off the hook for going into faggy apology mode
that is a terrible strategy
i dont know what the fuck has happened to you but my name is on the lease and i dont want to live with it
ira is mad at george for bringing up the jokes
i never told leo because i wanted the gig
i didnt know you were fucking over your friend
dont yell at me
well i fucking live with you now because he told me to leave
he kicked you out for that
he said friends dont lie and im fucking with his career
well in a way thats a compliment to me because hes so mad he cant hang out with me thats he mad at you
thats kind of cool
i got you kicked out
ira is unpacking a dufflebag of clothes he grabbed from his apartment when he was kicked out
george pops his head in
this should be comfortable in here
this room is almost as big as your old apartment
through gritted teeth thank you for letting me stay here
hey you want to come talk to me while i crash
you want to come talk to me while i crash
george is under the covers
he turns on the tv and he changes channels until he finds charlie rose
theyre interviewing a reporter from the new york times about americas policy towards pakistan
all right charlie
talk to me
george closes his eyes
george stands in the reception area
terrys ready for you
i was thinking that now might be a good time for me to make that script making amends
do you really think people want to see you make a movie about a guy who goes to aa but isnt really an alcoholic
he just needs the companionship
thats a pretty big left turn
i got money
i want to challenge myself
you said you liked it
you know i read it four years ago
i need to read it again
i dont remember not liking it
i just cant tell you the studio will make it
your last few movies didnt do so well
i thought they did well overseas
you always do well in australia but thats about it
what if i do it for no money just with back end
i dont know if thats going to cut it either
the head of the studio does a lot of drinking i dont think he finds that whole area funny
maybe if you commit to do another one of the davey movies i could tie it to that so they have to do both
ivedone four davey movies
they wantme to do another sequelto that
we dont even have ascript
welltheres this great script goingaround town happy holidays
whichis about an immature year old man who acts like a kid
in it he comes home for the holiday season for the first time in ten years
and havoc ensues
you get to make fun of thanksgiving and hanukkah and christmas and new years
they say they can turn it into a davey movie
could i at least shoot the making amends movie first
maybe ill just write something myself
i wish you would
youve never been able to do it in the past
you always talk a big game about writing your own shit
but ive yet to see a script land on my desk
george and ira are sitting at a large kitchen table
there is a computer on the table and index cards
on the floor is a corkboard
see the thing i was thinking was
you always play an immature guy
what if the joke of the movie is youre incredibly smart intellectual and well mannered
you just go the opposite way with it
theres nothing funny about being smart
all comedy comes from immaturity
buster keaton jerry lewis the marx brothers wc fields bill murray steve martin charlie chaplin
they were all immature
they were all knuckleheads
who wants to see a smart guy live his life normally
whats funny about that
what else you got
i gotta go through my notes
im thinking about taking a gig and having a solid hit before getting into breaking new ground
well well still write the script right
yeah if we can come up with an idea
lets just keep banging at it
ive got a date
you have a date
who do you have a date with
this woman my agent set me up with
she raises money for this environmental group
i guess shes like a normal person
i cant live here alone in this house forever
i need something of significance in my life
so im gonna go out on some dates
you know what you should do just as an experiment
you should try and not fuck her
why would you say that
because youre always saying you dont know if women like you for who you are
you dont know if they like you because you have money or youre famous
why not take some time and get to know them before ass raping them
in a romantic way
dont take out your frustrations on me because you cant get laid by acting like im some sort of deviant
im an adult
i have adult sexual relationships
no one does what they dont want to do
sex is how people decide if they like each other
im testing my compatibility by ass raping them
see you cant do it
you cant even entertain the idea of getting to know somebody for a month before sleeping with them
thats not true
im bored of sex anyway
there is literally no body part orifice combination i havent experimented with
there is nothing left to do
there is no nationalities i havent
slept with no age groups i havent slept with
im fully ready for normal
what nationalities have you slept with
the green zone
the killing fields of cambodia
what about you
do handjobs count
because then also california
george is talking with rachel warwick
you know i havent been out on a blind date ever
this may be the first one
oh i go out on them all the time
ive been on a bunch of j dates
whats j date
its a website where jewish people find each other
so its just a list of all the jewish people
i thought we didnt liked to be tracked and monitored like that
she looks at him doesnt get the joke
you know because of the
not understanding its just a great way for like minded people to meet
what if you dont like jews
she just stares at him
a beat so uh i hear you raise uh money for an environmental group
that must be very satisfying
it is because fixing the environment is really about having enough of a war chest to sue local government and corporations so theyre forced to observe the environmental statutes that
are already on the books
we also try to put pressure on the government to put pressure on other countries to clean up their environmental act
you know one dilapidated factory in china can produce more pollution than every car in america puts out in one year
thats why i still drive a big truck
i stop driving that truck and that factory shuts down
not smiling i know youre joking but its a very serious situation
people like you do a lot of damage to the environment
whether its taking a private jet by yourself or getting driven around town limos around town or living in your gas guzzling houses
your carbon footprint is huge
you know what they say about people with a big carbon footprint
george comes in and wakes ira up
were gonna go do a gig tonight
and youre gonna open up for me
how big a theater
i think two thousand
you should have told me so i could have prepared
ive never played a place that big
how long do you want me to do
thirty if you can get there
tickets are expensive
i dont own anything nice
ira is driving georges mercedes
george sits in player
backseat watching cloverfield on a built in dvd we see images of different parts of california
how fucking up north is this
its near san francisco
so we have like five more hours to drive
its not that far
its like two more movies
i dont like how you made me your limo driver
its weird youre in the back and im up here
id sit up front but the dvd player is back here
i cant even listen to the radio because youre watching the movie
can i sit back there and you drive
im near sighted
ill miss the exit
we lear an explosion from the movie
the monster showed himself
the car pulls up to the theater
one of the managers walks george and ira through the back of the theater toward the dressing room
they walk across the stage and we see the empty seat theater
ira is freaked out
george and ira are sitting in the dressing room nibbling from the fruit tray
theres a knock at the door
a security person escorts laura into the dressing room
ira is thrown
hey you made it
i wouldnt have missed it for the world thanks for inviting me
you remember ira
are you performing tonight
im afraid so
ive been told if im good it warms the crowd and if im bad it makes them want george more so
you look great
how are you feeling
im hanging in there
i thought a lot about you after i left
well the show is going to start in a minute i better get to my seat
i just wanted to say hi
dont be too dirty tonight you know that makes me uncomfortable
now i have no jokes
ira you have to do an hour and half
come by after and give me the review
break a leg
you didnt tell her that youre not sick anymore
why wouldnt you tell her
i need you to do something for me
after your set i gave you a seat right next to her
during the intermission i want yq
u to tell her im not sick anymore
why do you want me to tell her
because its weird and emotional
i think shell handle it better if it comes from somebody else
and then i can talk to her about it afterwards
shell be happy
its not weird
youre the bearer of good news
you had to do this to me right before my set
like im not nervous enough
ira is performing on stage doing his set
hes doing really well
this theater crowd is very enthusiastic about being there and gives him the benefit of the doubt on most of his jokes
as he continues his set he gets more confident and for the first time in the film we think he has the potential to be a strong comic
laura is sitting in her seat by herself
ira makes his way across the aisle and sits down next to her
oh my gosh
you were so good
you seem surprised
i dont know you seemed so nervous
but you were really solid all the way though and your ending hunk really murdered
hopefully george wont be mad if i tired the audience out
i dont think he has anything to worry about
they always go crazy for him
before he got famous he used to bomb all the time
and thats when i think he was the funniest
and now that everyone knows him its a little too easy for him i think
no one was funnier when the audience hated him than george
he loved it
so you guys were dating right when he started doing well
but you always knew he was gonna do well
he had so much charisma
he would walk into a room and in ten minutes that whole room would be about him
even before anyone knew who he was
where did you meet him
i was the hat check girl at the improv
and i was acting
i used to do guest spots on all those shows like melrose place beverly hills
i always played the bitch
i dont know why but i was on the top of the bitch list
you dont seem like a bitch
thats because i was acting
sounds like fun days
it was for awhile
reveal george in the wings trying to get a look at them from a distance
i dont know if youve heard but it looks like georges medicine is working
what do you mean
when george got sick they didnt think they had any medicine that would help so they put him on experimental medicine
and the last time he went to the doctor they couldnt detect his blood disease
they think it might be gone
a moment as laura takes this in
why didnt george tell me
he just found out
he doesnt want to jinx it
he doesnt want people to get excited and then have it come back again
the lights go down
ladies and gentlemen
heres the man you came to see
the place explodes
i thought everyone came to see me
george begins his act
he could not kill harder
or look more healthy and charismatic
we can tell it is all a show for laura
laura is completely thrown by this turn of events
the content of georges act is meant to portray him in a more positive sympathetic light to laura
he talks about being sick and the lessons he learned in a very dark hilarious and also uplifting way
all of it is intended to make him look like he has grown up and become wiser and someone you could trust and spend your life with
laura is talking to george and ira
i really dont know what to say
its not like you werent good before but your act is so much more sophisticated but just as funny
ive never seen you speak so honestly on stage before
you used to say these goofy jokes
it was really something you know and you should be really proud of yourself
a lot has happened
and at least i got some good jokes out of it
well thanks for inviting me
im really glad i came
ira and i are driving out of town tomorrow i thought maybe we could stop by your place on our way out
i want to see what the ranch looks like and meet your husband
my husband is actually in china for another week or so
he spends a lot of time there helping american businesses break into that market
so you wont meet him this time but it would be great if you came by
that would be fun
ill give you the tour
well come by in the morning
an awkward beat
laura gives ira a hug goodbye then hugs george goodbye trying to make it appear as if they have equal weight
ill see you then
she looks at ira
as she exits
you were good too
why do we have to stop by there tomorrow
the drive is long enough as it is
george opens up his wallet gives ira a thousand dollars
heres your money for tonight
im excited to see her ranch
i hear its delightful
ira and george are in a room that has two queen sized beds
they each lay on their bed in the dark
why couldnt we have gotten two different rooms
whats the fun in that
you can go pay for your own room i dont care
so what happened with you and laura
you seem to get along so well
why did you cheat on her
i was young stupid
and i liked fucking girls
why do you think i cheated
you would do it too if anyone would fuck you
how many times did you cheat on her
two or three times
for a couple of years
it was awful
there was even marriage talk
my parents didnt want me to do it because she wasnt jewish
she was taking classes to convert even
i mean how cool is that
she was changing religions to be with me
she knew more about being a jew than i did from those classes
she was so cute when she spoke hebrew it sounded so wrong
george says the jewish grand prayer with a waspy accent
and then one day somebody told her i dont know who
and that was that
why do you want to go see her tomorrow
we could do something productive like get some writing done
i like her
i love her
i miss her
i just want to spend a little time with her
i know nothing will come of it
i just miss being around her
george starts clicking through video on demand adult movies
anything looking good to you
i dont want to watch adult movies with you
you want to watch juno
juno begins playing
george and ira drive up to the house
its a large one story house that is part of a ranch with a lot of land and a horse stable
they walk to the front door ring the doorbell
george seems a little nervous
you okay buddy
yeah of course i am
laura opens the door
weve been waiting for you
come on in
this place is beautiful
weve been here for five years
i think i just finished decorating it
she leads them through the living room into a huge open kitchen
on the island there is freshly squeezed lemonade chips and dip
she has over prepared for their arrival
can i live here
of course you can clean the stables
you have horses
clarke my husband was a real city boy
but for some reason he loves horses
of course im lef t to take care of them
but yes we have three horses
thats crazy owning a horse
i cant even keep a goldfish alive
all right well were ready for the big tour
i want to see how you live
suddenly lauras five year old daughter ingrid runs into the room and shes pissed
you said you were coming back
were playing american idol youre ruining the game
ira is shocked to see that laura has a child
this complicates a situation he already thought was getting too complicated
ill come right up
this is my friend george
its my turn to sing and youre supposed to be the judge and youre not in there and im very angry
how old are you
but i turn six very soon
because i thought you were like nine about to turn ten
shes very pretty
to ingrid i like your hair
im so sick of people telling me they like my hair
george is clearly not that good with kids
i do not like your hair
dont make fun of me
hes just joking ingrid
i have curly hair too
curly hair is the best
last week my mom straightened it and it almost went to the floor
if you straighten my hair i look crazy
i look like the killer from no country for old men
have you seen that movie
mable lauras ten year old daughter storms into the room
you guys left me all alone in the playroom
if youre gonna leave im just gonna go talk on the webcam with caroline
dont be rude
this is ira and george
oh i know you
my mom watches your movies all the time
but most of them im not allowed to see
george smiles at ira lauras a little busted
do you like them
which ones your favorite
i dont know
i dont really like the ones im allowed to see but i think i would like the ones im not allowed to see
but she says i cant see them till im sixteen
just fast forward past the bad parts
the whole thing is a bad part
george laughs in a slightly flirty fashion with laura
ira is getting uncomfortable with the subtext
cmon lets finish the game
george ira laura and mable are sitting on the floor
ingrid stands on a make shift stage singing a miley cyrus song while wearing a feather boa and sunglasses and a red wig
youve got the best of both worlds
rock it out take it slow
and then you rock out the show
everyone applauds for her
now its time to see what the judges say
i thought you had a lot of energy youre clearly gonna make it to the final four and i love your outfit
what do you think randy
that was the bomb
it was a little pitchy in places but i dug it
i really dug it
im simon and i thought it was horrible
i dont how you made it this far in the competition
i think paula is drunk
you will never be american idol
mable stop it
stop being mean to your sister
say something nice
you were good
okay youre not simon anymore
to george simon what did you think
i cant believe im saying this but i agree with paula
i think youre the one to beat
they all applaud
ira notices laura looking at george with admiring eyes that reek of more than friendship
okay mable youre up
mable instantly starts gyrating in a manner that is not appropriate for a ten year old and singing the fergie song london bridge
i want to go down like london london
i told you not to do that
simon what do you think
she was horrible
shes a terrible singer
okay whos next
i dont know dawg
it was a bad song choice
im not feeling it
get ready to be blown away
george gets up on stage
take me down to the paradise city
where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
oh wont you please take me home
just an urchin livin under the street im a hard case thats tough to beat
im your charity case so buy me somethin to eat
ill pay you at another time
take it to the end of the line
its paradise city by guns and roses
you sound like a girl
vote him off
laura sits on a atv
george sits behind her
ira is on another atv with ingrid sitting in front of him as he steers
mable rides a very small dirt bike
here we go
they start driving down a path that goes around the edge of the ranch
george has his hands around lauras waist as they drive
ira looks over concerned
laura shows them their horses chickens goats and ducks
laura points out a small pond and a fenced in riding area
laura slows down and allows ira mable and ingrid to get ahead and turn a corner
then she stops the atv and turns around and kisses george
george looks surprised but happy
laura just stares at him trying to decide what she makes of him now
then we hear mom
laura hits the gas and they continue the tour
the kids are playing in the background as george laura and ira talk
ira laura invited us to stay over for dinner
but its like a seven eight hour drive home
if we stay for dinner were not going to get home till like four in the morning
george stares at ira for a beat then dont worry well figure it out
you have something to do in the morning
then everything will be fine
me and george are gonna go to the supermarket and buy some food so i can cook dinner
you think youll be okay watching the kids
itll only take forty five minutes
im great with kids
i was a camp counselor for five years
kids love me
im like a human teddy bear
laura is driving through town
george sits in the passenger seat
this town is so small and adorable
its like out of a demi moore movie
clarkes company is about forty five minutes from here
this town seemed so perfect when we were looking for a house
theres no traffic theres one coffee house one bookstore one market
but after youve lived her a few years you hunger for another coffee shop a bigger bookstore and a little crime
it gets so boring
and its such a small town god forbid you miss one of you kids soccer games they put the scarlet letter on you
it cant be that bad
you live on a pretty little ranch
you have horses a duck
it must be a nice life
we used to have so much fun
i dont think i have that much fun anymore
i dont like who im turning into
is the fun over
i have to get up every morning at six drive my kids to school and then i have hours before i have to pick them up
i have to yell at them to do their homework be a taskmaster then i make them dinner
it takes an hour to shower them and put them to bed
and then its and i pass out
and its great but tuck
and when both kids are done with high school ill be years old and then ill have probably very healthy years then ill kind of slow down and then ill
be an old woman
and that was it
and its great but fuck
i couldnt believe you moved out of la
you were getting some good jobs as an actress
you got to play the bitch on melrose place for awhile and make out with andrew shue
that was pretty good
do you miss it
being a mom is very fulfilling but there are other parts of me and every once in awhile i go a little crazy
how do you go crazy
i just get bored and depressed
and you know how my pms is kind of out of control
this little boy hit ingrid in school and his mom acted like she didnt care at all so i told her to fuck off
they both laugh
oh that must have gotten ugly
how long did that stay awkward for
that woman hates me
and i hate her
and now our kids really like each other so its really fucked up
maybe you werent acting on melrose place
ira mable and ingrid are making elaborate paper mache heads
as they do it ira is leading them in the type of song you would sing at camp
and my husband cheated on me said he did it once but i know because i learned from you they do it once they do it all the time
you either cheat or you dont
well i dont anymore
i havent cheated on anybody since you
i havent even been in a committed relationship since you so its impossible for me to have cheated
thats both flattering and deeply disturbing
i thought a lot about you when i was sick and i would do anything for another chance
i know it creates a mess but i think it would be worth it
i think we both know its what we should be doing
he kisses her
we cant go the supermarket
because people will see us
whats wrong with that
well itll be weird because were about to do something we shouldnt do
ira mable and ingrid are outside at a table building houses out of popsicle sticks
if you had an exacto knife we could cut these sticks in half and make a chimney
when is george gonna die
george is gonna die
why would you say that
i heard my mom talking to her friend about it on the phone and crying
i dont want george to die
what do you care
you just met him
george is gonna be fine
they told me my grandfather wouldnt die but he did
heres the truth
george was really sick
but he went to the doctor and they found the right medicine and now hes better
and hes gonna live a long time
the kids buy it and ira seems relieved
i think my moms in love with him
ira looks doubly disturbed
he quickly goes back to his popsicle sticks
george and laura park in the driveway then sneak around to a back guest house
george and laura enter the guest house which has been turned into her husbands office playroom sports viewing room
on the wall are six enormous flatscreen tvs
the room is also filled with sports memorabilia in lucite cases and expensive looking sports photography
does somebody in your family like sports
they start passionately making out slamming into the flatscreens
i really never thought i was going to see you again
i grieved for you like you were dead
they continue to kiss
suddenly she stops
i cant do this
then lets not do it
she stares at him trying to figure out what hes become is he a good guy or a bad guy
i gotta get back to the kids
latjras ranch entryway day laura and george are walking into the house
they are not holding any bags
they walk into the living room where ira is making a spongebob squarepants puzzle on the floor with mable and ingrid
that was quick
the town is beautiful
where are the groceries
we decided ordering in might be a little more fun
everyone is sitting on the couch watching ratatouille on the television
they see car lights in the driveway
all right everybody
lets sit down at the kitchen table
everyone gets up and heads toward the kitchen
laura opens the front door george is a few steps behind her
a handsome man of forty appears
this is not the pizza guy
its clarks lauras husband
clarke oh my gosh
what are you doing home
the man i was supposed to have a meeting with had a heart attack if you can believe that
so i decided to try and sneak home for a few days before my next set of meetings
george appears behind laura not knowing what hes getting himself into
george had a performance last night in town which i went to and him and his opening act ira came by to say hello on their way out of town
there is an awkward moment then clarke smiles and gives george a compassionate look the type of look you give a man you think is dying
it is really nice to meet you george
laura talks about you all the time and were obviously big fans of your movies
well thank you
youve got a great family and a great home
im so glad youre home honey
laura gives clarke a hug and a peck
then ira walks over
whats taking so long with the pizza
before anyone can say anything the pizza delivery guy appears in the doorway
thatll be twenty eight forty seven please
everyone is seated for dinner including the kids
this is really great pizza
thank you very much
it tastes just like new york pizza which is so surprising because you cant get good pizza in los angeles so you wouldnt think you could get it in northern
but this really tastes like new york pizza
a long pause
sounds like your business is going very well
people never thought china would do this much business with us you know but it didnt seem like a risky proposition for me
theyve got a billion people we make all kinds of cool shit in america they start finding out about it on the internet and what not
sooner or later theyre gonna find a way to get our shit
he speaks chinese
ingrid yells at something in chinese
you dont think they want new mobile phones
a new x box
im trying to get access into north korea no shit
that situation could chance overnight
that is a huge market waiting to be tapped
its already starting in cuba
my friend backpacked across china and he caught some sort of virus or something from what he ate
he was sickforweeks
he still has it
itsthekind of thing you cant getridof you have it for the restofyour life but it stays dormant
how are you holding up
im hanging in there
how are you feeling
hes doing really well
hes been very strong
its a terrible situation
im so sorry
i appreciate that
hes been fighting the good fight
his doctors are taking very good care of him
ira can believe this conversation is happening
youre a tougher man than me
i dont know how i could go about my day with that hanging over my head
it just makes you appreciate every moment
it brings things into focus you suddenly realize whats important in life
does anybody want seconds
or should i bring out the desert
id love desert
what do you have
do you have any ice cream or cake or anything like that
i have a real big sweet tooth right now
why dont we go into the kitchen and do an ice cream bar with kids right now
ive got a better idea i make a really good milkshake
we should all go make milkshakes with the kids right now in the kitchen
empty milkshakes litter the coffee table
do you know who might be able to help you
a chinese doctor
have you explored eastern medicine at all
nows not the time to talk about this
im trying to help the man
no i havent
im the last guy who would buy into that shit but it works
he really is the last guy who would buy into that shit
our countrys only two hundred years old
the chinese have been around for thousand of years figuring this shit out
how i got into it i had acid ref lux and nothing was working and then this guy at work turned me onto a chinese doctor and he gave me
some herbs that tasted like dogshit but they worked
i take herbs for my pms
they really helped
daddy youve been cursing a lot
you owe me a dollar for every curse
i think you owe me fifty dollars
this conversation is scaring me
i dont want george to die
you girls can go play in the other room
the chinese have a completely different way of looking at health
they dont think doctors should attack the diseases in the body theyre all about trying to support the body and make it stronger so the body can fight off the
ive seen it
i wish i could find a way to mass market chinese medicine in this country
someones gonna do it and make a fuck load of money
because these people get old really old
you cant kill these people
either that or theyre all young and they just look like shit
this guys funny
you should be opening up for this guy
hey who wants a drink
everyone is taking a walk around the ranch
it is very pretty outside
im going to retire in seven years
im playing golf for the next fifty years
work hard now then get out
thats my plan
im putting in the time
then im getting the fuck out
i dont like working
i will do it
i like what it gets me
but i dont like it
you ever see laura act
she was quite an actress in her day
thats what i hear
cant say i watched that much melrose place back in the day
she keeps telling me to watch the videos but you know i was never a big party of five fan
well i also ran a theatre company
and it was down to me and cameron diaz for the mask
i sacrificed a lot for our family
okay if you say so
a beat the mask was a funny fucking movie
you know what other movie cameron diaz was great in
theres something about mary
laura looks livid at her husbands insensitivity and disrespect
they keep walking
i love walking it off after a big meal
its beautiful here at night
theres no pollution here like in la so you can actually see the stars
they are beautiful but we have to get going
we have a really long drive to get back to los angeles
you cant leave now you wont get back until daylight
you should crash in the guest house
im sure it not as fancy pants as where you live george but its better than driving all night or crashing at a hotel
and if you want to hang out tomorrow i just installed six flatscreens we can watch all the football games we want
and dog racing from florida
theres a big game tomorrow
ira you must have played some ball in your day
no im just big boned
we probably should get some rest before the drive
all right show us to our quarters sir
george sleeps on the bed
ira sleeps on a couch across the room
the door slowly opens laura enters wearing a bathrobe
she walks to the bed and quietly slips under the covers removing her bathrobe in the process
without ever speaking she pulls the covers over both of them and begins to make love to him
george is surprised but not completely shocked and goes along happily with it
angle on ira he never wakes up
you sure you cant stay
we really do need to get back
i have to visit my mom
i cant miss it
its her birthday
everyone in my family is coming in from across the country for it
its very important we get back for it
thats too bad i wish you could stay
very serious i wish i could say i was gonna see you again but i cant say that
his eyes start to mist up
you dont need to do that
you know what
i think i do need to do that
one thing i learned in china from some buddhist friends of mine is its important to have an open heart to live in the moment and to speak the truth
to each other
so id like to say to you george that it was a great pleasure to meet someone who had such a big impact on my wifes life
i really like you
and wish we had more time to get to know each other
and i wish you a peaceful end to your journey
and another great journey on the other side of it
clarke hugs george
i really dont know what to say
i re ally dont know what to say
that was beautiful honey
well let me walk them to the car
ingrid walks over
dont be sad
ira told us that his medicine is working and hes not sick anymore
i think that was a secret
i dont think you were supposed to say that
mable take ingrid into the house
can we watch another spongebob movie
go into the house and watch a movie now
mable and ingrid walk back to the house
what the fuck is going on around here
to laura is that true
i never said that he was still sick
he just took some medicine and its looking better
you cant detect it in his blood but it could come back
is it looking better
or is he better
to ira is he sick anymore
i dont how you define these things im not
is something going on here
are you getting your revenge on me while im away
i came clean with you you cant come clean with me
you know what
i dont know what i want now
so this is what you want
was he ever sick in the first place
he was sick
he was very sick
because if this is what you want ill leave right now
im not going to play these games
im happy to leave
im not gonnna have you put me on the cross because i made some mistakes
you guys enjoy each other
i could give a fuck
if you need me ill be at my apartment in china
mable and ingrid are asleep
laura is alone in her room crying
she might be on the phone talking honestly with a friend
george lays on the bed
ira is pacing around the room
what the fuck is going on
did you guys do something
we had sex in clarkes office
because i love her
shes the best thing thats ever happened to me
but she has two kids shes married
he cheated on her
you cheated on her
yeah but that was a long time ago
you saw that douche bag
you dont think hes fucking geishas on every business trip
he was trying to cure you with herbs
he seems like a great guy
this is none of your fucking business
just stay out of it
i cant stay out of it
we took your car here
i have no way of leaving
this shit is deeper than you understand
people get divorced
people make mistakes and then they fix them
thats how life works
its not a big deal
i know youre still sad because your parents got divorced
well get the fuck over it
call a fucking cab and go home
so what are we gonna do
youre gonna sleep in clarkes office
im gonna go talk to laura
george walks into the room discovers laura on the computer going through papers
she is smoking a joint
on there you are
ive been looking for you
ive been going through all the bank statements trying to figure out which are in his name and which are in mine
almost all the accounts are in his name
i wonder if he did that on purpose
are you smoking a joint
my best friend nancy grows this stuff on a hill by her house
you want some
no that stuff makes me paranoid
it makes me feel sharper some people get tired i get more energy more clear
whatever we want to happen is gonna happen now
im fucking free
laura gets up kisses him
yeah were free
they start kissing again
she starts to moan loudly
not so loud your kids are sleeping
a tank could roll through this place it wouldnt wake them up
they kiss some more
she moans louder
ira calls daisy on the phone in a panic about what is happening
on phone hey daisy
whats going on
i just wanted to talk to you because im in the middle of a terrible situation and i dont have anyone i can talk about it with
my friends are all mad at me and george is kind of losing his mind
you can tell me what is it
look i know you think i have the moral code of some guy from the s like dwight eisenhower but im with george and hes hitting on his ex girlfriend
whos married now and has kids and i dont know what to do
im kind of freaking out
i think im having a panic attack
well dont have a panic attack thats not going to help anything
well telling me to not have a panic attack is not going to stop it
screaming at the top of her lungs haha very funny
seriously whats going on
well i guess they dated like ten years ago
ira and daisy begin to have a bonding conversation
laura george ira mable and ingrid are happily cooking and eating breakfast
they look like a happy strange kid of family
numerous images of them horse back riding
ira looks terrified
they are all fishing feeding ducks
they pick lemons out of a tree
they are riding atvs while their dogs chase them
the kids are climbing a tree
laura is spotting them
george pulls ira aside
jesus christ what time is it already
its in the morning
oh my god
i mean this is fun but i dont know how much i can take
hopefully theyll take a nap at some point
i want to take a nap
they dont look that tired
the kids are yelling and screaming and clearly have eight more hours in them
george laura ira and the kids are seated at a table
the kids are coloring with crayons
look what i did
i want this hung up on the wall
she shows them the picture which is clearly not appropriate for the wall a picture of herself choking and dying
the food here made me sick
mama i have to go to the bathroom
come wipe my butt
i have to talk to them for a minute
mable go wipe your sisters butt
she can do it
shes almost six
ingrid and mable walk off together
i wet the bed til i was eleven
it wasnt even a mental thing
i just got relaxed when i was asleep
i spoke to clarke
hes going to fly back to china tonight
i was thinking about driving to the airport and meeting him there and telling him that when he comes back he should find another place to live
are you okay doing that
its what i want
i just need to figure out when we would move down to la
it might be better to let the kids finish out the school year because i have to apply to the private schools in la and i dont know if i
missed the deadline
then id have to look into the charter schools
sometimes these private schools if you give them a donation they let your kids in
maybe you can stay up here for part of the year if i cant make it happen
if im not shooting a movie or on tour or something that would be great
laura leans in and kisses george
george is not big on public displays of affection
he kisses back but you can tell that hes very uncomfortable
they hear the kids headed back to the table and quickly separate
i made her wipe her own butt
i did it but i dont know if i did a good job
to george look at what i drew
i drew a picture of you
george holds it up
it is a picture of several people
thats all of us
we see the picture and it is everybody holding hands
george and ira are walking around a very small bookstore
this is a small bookstore
theyve only got one philip roth book
didnt he write like fifty books
so when are we going to go home
youre not talking at all about when were going to go home
shes going to talk to clarke tonight and then shes going to make a plan
weve got to get over that hurdle
are you okay with everything
this is happening pretty fast
this is exactly what i wanted
i mean shes cool right
i dont really know her very well
she was kind of cooler when i knew her back in the day
shes still hot but she was crazy hot back then
her attitude has changed a bit
with the kids and all
back then she was really sexy and all about fucking
i know shes busy with her life now but it is a little different
yeah well when you have two kids and a husband and horses and ducks its not all about fucking
thats just the hormones of youth
im all about fucking
but i dont expect to be when i get older
ill be occasionally about fucking which is normal
the fact that youre all about fucking now is the weird thing
well hopefully everything will work out
if it doesnt it just wasnt meant to be
what does that mean
it means im going to give it a shot
im excited but im not going to really know if it works until were in it
i hope im just not in love with the person she used to be
shes about to leave her husband for good
she has two kids
youre not sure this is going to work
theres no way to ever be sure that anythings going to work
i couldnt live up here
she wants me to live up here
i dont think i can do it
maybe a couple of weeks a year
well shell live with you
do you think she means that shes going to bring the kids too
what else would she do
i dont know dont some men get custody of the kids
or they split the custody
i like the kids but ive never lived with kids before
the young ones kind of cute but i dont think i can stand the old one full time
theres too much going on there
but i could definitely tolerate the young one
maybe they can split kids
maybe clarke will take the annoying one
ira just stares at him not sure what to do
george kisses laura and then she gets in her car
ill be back in an hour and a half tops
and then it all begins
okay call me if you need any backup
i love you
really uncomfortable i
the car drives off
ira is on the floor with the kids
he watches the headlights of lauras car disappear down the driveway
george walks back into the room
okay im going to go into the other room and watch some tv
you dont want to hang with the kids
nah i was going to watch four hockey games at once
ive never done that
okay but ive got to run out and grab some cigarettes
but you dont smoke
i never smoked in front of you because you were sick
but i do
ira drives in a panic
holy shit holy shit
wheres the fucking airport around here
ira tries to figure out how to work the navigation system in a panic
he cant make it work
george is watching the kids
he is not good with them so it is very weird
george jumps up and runs to her
she is in the bathroom sitting on the toilet
can you wipe my butt
dont you know how to do it
i dont do it good
ira is still messing with the navigation system
he finally gets frustrated and punches it
ira yells to someone on the street
how do you get to the fucking airport
george calls ira gets voice mail
where are you where are you
you have to come back here
i need your help
i dont know how to do this
he walks back to where the kids are
they are watching tv
all around the room are family pictures
he is beginning to feel bad about what is happening
laura gets to check in looks around
she does not see clarke
george is sitting at the kitchen table
mable walks over
i think my mom and dad are getting a divorce
i dont want my parents to get divorced
all my friends parents are divorced and theyre not happy
why would you say that
i heard my mom talking to her friend
i listened through the wall
she was looking for a lawyer
he cheated on her
what does cheating mean
that hes going to marry someone else
why dont they just try harder
laura looks for clarke at the news stand
george is on the phone
laura its george
come back to the house
maybe you shouldnt do it
maybe its too early for this
call the house
laura walks into the airport lounge
she sees clarke
she looks at him for a moment then heads over to him with determination
ira parks in the no standing zone
he gets out and starts walking into the airport
his phone rings he answers
where are you
im getting cigarettes
youve been gone for forty minutes
i got lost
i dont know this town
well come back
i dont know how to take care of these kids im not a camp counselor like you
these kids are on to me
the older ones too intense
shes like damien from the omen
i need help
ok ill hurry back
ira runs around the airport looking for laura and clarke
laura is talking to clarke emotional
clarke is crying
im so sorry
this only happened because of me
its all my fault
i made you feel terrible
i made you feel unsafe in our relationship
im so sorry
please forgive me
ira stands there staring at them
im sorry too
i love you so much
it was just a flirtation
it never went anywhere
its just after you cheated on me i felt so alone
and you were gone so often that i felt like our life doesnt work
then i have to make a change
ill stop most of the traveling
theres nothing more important than you and the kids
ira starts to turn to sneak away
clarke sees him
whats going on
what are you doing here
oh im just headed back to los angeles
ive got some spots at the improv ive got to do this weekend
under her breath oh fuck
youre headed back to los angeles
then why are you at the international terminal
this is the international terminal
im so confused ive never been to this airport before
yeah this is the air china first class lounge
reveal that everyone else in the lounge is chinese
what the fuck is going on
what the fuck is going on laura
i dont know what to say
tel me the truth
just tell me the tri
i came here to tell you that i wanted you to move out when you came home
but i realized this was a mistake so i didnt say it
please dont hold that against me
weve worked everything out
everything is fine
whos watching the kids
whos watching the fucking kids
an adult is watching them
is george watching our fucking kids
i will kill him
clarke runs off
what the hell happened
who the fuck are you
get the fuck out of my life
you and george have to get the fuck out of my life
you are ruining everything
ira runs out of the lounge
laura runs out also
george with the kids
oblivious to what is happening
ira comes back out his car is about to be towed
no no no
clarke drives home pissed off
laura drives home quickly
ira drives in a panic on his cell phone
the phone goes through to georges voice mail
clarke is coming back to the house
he knows everything
im coming to get you
be at the end of the driveway
be at the next driveway over
to the north
clarke arrives at the house
he sees george sitting with the kids
angry to mable and can you take it into the family fun room
are you two going to fight
george and clarke walk outside
clarke puts up his fists ready to fight
shes not happy
clarke punches george in the face then kicks him martial arts style
no one whos married is fucking happy
leave us alone
you fucked up
you fucked it up with her a long time ago
let it go or i will kill you
i will literally kill you till youre fucking dead
that disease didnt kill you
but i will kill you
you shouldnt joke about my disease
that was very serious
clarke punches him several times but they are more like martial arts hits
what the hell is that
george starts yelling at ira
dont jump in
whatever you do dont jump in
i dont want your help
you said you were getting cigarettes then you ran to the airport to stop her
what kind of friend are you
i am a good friend because this entire situation is crazy
you are out of control
i didnt deserve what you did to me
you betrayed me
when i got there she was already kissing him
i never even had a chance to stop it
i didnt get to do anything
dont pretend youre fucking mad at each other just to distract me so i wont beat your ass
clarke pushes george
youre gonna come to my house
youre gonna come to my fucking house
you have to get your own life
leave us the fuck alone
dont hit me
ive been sick
they dont know
the medicine is working now but im still sick
clarke punches george
to ira what are you doing
i said to jump in
you told me not to jump in
thats what dont jump in means
it means jump in
ira steps in
clarke hits him hard then kicks him
youre a terrible fighter
i know thats why i became a comedian because everyone used to beat me up
george runs at clarke who cracks him in the head hard sending him to the floor
then ira takes a run at him and clarke kicks ira in the face twice with both feet
laura runs into the middle of the scene
laura tell clarke to stop
clarke please dont do this
dont tell me what i can and can not do
laura tell him
tell him you want to be with me now
laura doesnt answer
why did you have to come here and confuse me
everything was fine before you came here
now everything is all screwed up
laura whats it going to be
are you going with him or are you going with me
laura looks at clarke
dont do this
you fucked up my life
and now i fucked up yours
but just a little
probably just for a day
she walks back into the house
hit the road before i put you through another round
you cheated on her too
yeah but were married
were going to work through this shit
you should have waited until you were married to cheat
it buys you another chance
clarke punches george
ira is on the ground
he doesnt get up
she told me i was the love of her life
and she loves me more than she loves you
when she said that did she think you were dying
too bad you had to live and find out it wasnt true
leave my fucking family alone
clarke punches him
george gets a punch in but it doesnt hurt clarke
clarke punches him again
i can do this all night
clarke hits george again
ira leaps on clarke and now all three are on the ground rolling around arms flailing
to ira stop ira youre hitting me too
mable and ingrid appear outside
what are you guys doing
the three look at the kids and instantly feel awful
were just playing thats all
boys like to wrestle just like girls
they all start wrestling some more but this time it is fake playful
they give each other noogies and tickle each other so the kids wont be scared
a little blood runs off of georges face
are you bleeding
we were just painting
i got some paint on my cheek
come on girls
lets go inside
mable and ingrid run inside
clarke turns to george
you know what sucks about this
i like your movies and now i cant watch them anymore
clarke walks away then walks back
that was mean
through ail of this i want you to know something
im glad that youre not sick and i understand
and i forgive you
clarke goes inside
that was meaner than him punching you
that is a demented motherfucker
george punches ira in the face
ira fires back two punches at georges face and he stumbles back
none of you fuckers can hurt me
george pauses then leaps onto ira and they roll on the ground for a moment
ira makes his way free and gets up
get the hell off of me you psycho
drive me home
how are you gonna get home then
they drive in silence for a moment
you are the most self involved person i have ever met
no matter what the situation no matter how many laughs or how many women you get you will never be happy
youre always going to be miserable
you are a bottomless pit
a bottomless wound
what about you
you are just a lackey
who are you to judge me
you tried to screw me over after all i
have done for you
i am not responsible for you
you wanted me to sit back and destroy this womans life
help you cheat on her
you put me in a terrible position
i dont give a fuck go fuck yourself
you made me the tacky
im not a lacky its a job
its not a job youre a tacky
youre not even that fucking funny
this gets ira very mad
if being funny means being like you i rather be a little less funny
youre the only person i know who learned nothing from a near death experience
you actually went backwards
all it did was it brought out what a prick you are brought everything bad to the surface
i liked you better when i was sure you were gonna die
im not going anywhere
everything is about you
you dont even know where i live
youve never asked me one question about my life
how much can one person talk about himself
you never ask me shit about anything
who are you to fucking judge anyone
youre not my friend you just want my money
you just want to get your foot in the door
fuck your money
this has all been a huge mistake
wake me when we get home
george climbs in the back seat and tries to go to bed
music up ted hawkins song strange conversation
ira drives george home in the dark
neither one speaks
we see images of different cities going by the window
ira thinks about all hes been through and the challenges ahead ira pulls up to his apartment
okay im getting out
you have to drive yourself home
im getting out here
why didnt you drive me to my house
because then id still have your car
youll drop it off later
there is no later
im not going to ever talk to you again
so i dont want your car
so thats how its going to be
there is an enormous pile of stuff to do on his dining room table
several stacks of scripts
one pile has a big post it note that says read these
george lies alone in bed alone
eyes wide open
its really bright in his room
george hits a button
the shades automatically close
the room goes dark
now hes in the dark with his eyes open
he turns on the tv to go to sleep
its the today show
its really happy and morning themed
the piece on the today show is very suburban
how to clean up clutter
you know when youve got a big family and youve got a lot of clutter
ira is talking to leo
we rented out your room to jay
but you can crash on the couch if you want
oh man you got jerked off on that couch
i fucking didnt cum on the couch
just sleep on it for a month and then well find some excuse to boot jay out
im sorry i lost my way for a while
george reads one from a large pack of scripts
a few pages in he clearly doesnt like it
he puts it down picks up another one
the large stack is clearly the ones he doesnt like
ira writes at a table
george walks out of a store
a beautiful woman tries to chat him up but he lets her know he i
s busy and has to go
he walks off
she looks disappointed
ira talks to daisy
they seem to be getting along well
daisy is performing on stage
she gets off and heads over to ira
that was great
she kisses him
the manager walks over
hey ira federman got in a car accident
do you want to take his spot
george walks over with a young comedian of about iras age
this young man has clearly taken his place
hey hows it going
this is randy
hes funny youd like his stuff
im sure i would
i look forward to seeing it
are you going on tonight
i hope so
to george do you want to go up
ira was gonna take federmans spot but we can get you up if you want to
no thats ok
i dont want to take iras spot
im just gonna hang out tonight
ira is introduced
he walks onto the stage
we see george walk to the very back corner of the club and sit down at a table by himself
on stage ira does his act
he is much more comfortable than we have ever seen him on stage before
he is no longer searching for his comic identity
he has found a way to be himself on stage and tells jokes which are more personal than we have seen before
not everything kills but when something eats it he does not seem thrown
sometimes he seems amused
he watches from the back of the room
at first he does not laugh but then slowly starts laughing but more at the things ira does in between jokes
we can tell that he is proud of ira and misses him
ira is back behind the counter working at the deli with chuck and gail
he doesnt look too unhappy to be there
is the potato salad fresh
i made it myself this morning
is it good
i stake my reputation on it
give me a quart
gail this fine woman would like a quarfof potato salad
the woman moves to the other side of the counter
we reveal george standing there holding his ticket
do you have any turkey thats hormone free
yes we do
so this is where you work
back in the saddle
i thought we were writing a screenplay
well youre not a very good writing partner
or any kind of partner
you want to make me a turkey sandwich and talk to me
they give you breaks around here
there is a small seating area in the supermarket where people eat food at the deli counter
george and ira sit across from each other
in my travels i have learned a lot about asia and buddhism
and i would like to be in the moment now with you and to tell you how sorry i am and how much i have appreciated your friendship
and even if we are not friends in the future i wish you well on your journey
that guy was a douche bag
but also kind of cool
its a very weird combination
he was going to heal you with those herbs man
you get sick again you should call that guy
i think most of what you said to me was true
and i really am sorry
i think im still not very healthy
in my brain
its all right man
youve been through a lot
well i appreciate you trying to help me
even though it was kind of an impossible task
is everything going okay
how are you doing
i am not doing well but things have certainly been worse
so i will be fine
you were good the other night
i hear youre getting regular spots now
im actually going up tonight
any new jokes youre working on
yeah ive been trying to get off my ass and do some writing
what do you got
ira is surprised to hear him ask this since he has never asked this before
i was thinking about doing a bit about how im not very good looking but im not bad looking but im just good looking enough that if i had a
good personality it might put me over the top
you should do something about how when you date a girl and you feel really good and she likes you and then you see pictures of all her ex boyfriends
and theyre all really goofy looking guys and its not that youre good looking its just that in this psychotic girls eyes youre good looking
and how all of her boyfriends look like lou costello
why dont you say dom deluise
its a more current reference
what year was cannonball run
what else you got
i was going to talk about how i havent had sex in so long that i cant even remember my previous sexual experiences so i can masturbate to them
you should say now when i masturbate i have to think about the last time i masturbated
thats a good one
you can write
you know i always wanted to be part of the comedy field
as the camera pulls back george continues to pitch ira jokes for his act the first selfless act weve seen him commit in the entire film
as their friendship rekindles we
