screenplay by clayton frohman and ron shelton story by clayton frohman birds are flushed from hiding
a soldier carrying an automatic weapon rises up out of the grass and looks around
a mortar shell explodes nearby
there are no sound effects
he seems unperturbed
several more explosions in the field
the soldier motions with his arm and fifty more soldiers rise up out of the grass more small explosions
with a click click of a camera still no fx
the soldiers run through the grass following their leader as they do the platoon leader waves his arms again
five elephants charge out of the shrubbery through a field of small mortar explosions
with the click click of a camera
the elephants charge out across the plains each carries an enormous load of supplies and each is ridden by a soldier with a rifle
a helicopter gunship dives out of the sky firing rockets at the soldiers and elephants
a tribal mask is painted on the nose of the chopper
the soldiers on the elephants stand up and aim rifles at the chopper and begin firing
the chopper attacks the elephants against an african sunset
a door slams o
and the figure of russell price appears at the top of some stairs
sleepy eyed he pulls on a multi pocketed fishing vest over a baggy shirt
he carries a beat up canvas bag over his shoulder
a black woman sleeps at the lobby switchboard desk
another old black man sweeps the floor
price mumbles a good morning and goes to two vintage ww ii vending machines one for candy one for coca cola
he buys two candy bars and a coke and begins eating his breakfast as he crosses the lobby
jimmy a cab driver has been sleeping in a chair against the wall
several street vendors have their wares laid out on the sidewalk against the hotel
some are shaded by makeshift awnings some are not
jimmy rises as price arrives there is familiar ritual in their greeting
they cross the street together toward jimmys waiting taxi a hand painted purple old american car with the words on the door new peoples taxi company and jimmys name in
script above it
price hands a candy bar to jimmy
morning jimmy think you could squeeze me in
where is you would care to go at once mr
price hands him a wad of bills
youre a thief jimmy
jimmy smiles broadly nodding then points to the sky
booteeful picture huh snap snap
i dont do skies
the two men get into the strange cab parked in front of an open marketplace just starting to come alive the cab drives off
the taxi arrives and price gets out
price ambles over to stand in the early morning shade against an old building
a hand painted image of che guevarra with an x painted over it is on one wall
price pulls a joint from his pocket and lights up taking a hit
the sounds of war machinery soon interrupt the stillness
price hurries to the corner
price pulls a handful of colored rags from his pocket and picks out a yellow kerchief tying it to his arm
price then steps boldly into the street in front of the approaching convoy
he exchanges shouts with an officer in a jeep and with a motion is given permission to join
each truck is filled with perhaps african soldiers in khaki each holding an automatic rifle
another jeep follows towing a world war ii cannon
cheerily hi guys
the soldiers look over disinterestedly
two dozen cases of coca cola are tied to a stretcher among stacks of guns
as price settles in for the ride he begins pulling cameras from his bag
quickly and automatically rarely looking he switches lenses loads film and prepares his cameras
he has done this a thousand times
a single white soldier oates rises from among the blacks and shakily makes his way toward price
a mercenary dressed in a ragged uniform of his own design carries two machine guns and a
he smiles broadly recognizing price
hodge slaps prices hands as if they were teammates
gdamn price you tuna sucking piece of raw meat whatchyou goin to zambeze for
thought id get some great shots of your head gettin blown to smithereens

he laughs obscenely and deeply
i thought you were fighting for the government
this is the government
these are the rebels
fuck they are
this is a government convoy to calunda
this is the abou deian revolutionary front

finally oates starts laughing uncontrollably
these guys be pissed if they knew eh
price nods in agreement oates suddenly gets serious this is the dumbest motherfucker i ever signed up for
dont pay shit either
price nods in agreement nicaragua
thats the spot
cheap shrimp lotta rays real thin in the spook department too dig
the convoy rumbles past a check point into a small airfield containing a motley collection of dc s and old planes
two russian advisors and three cuban advisors watch
i wonder where the fuckin guvmint is
as he speaks the cab of the truck is rocked with a mortar shell and explodes
soldiers scramble to safety
some grab the guns being transported
two soldiers grab the stretcher of coke and start running for safety
smoke and explosions are everywhere they abandon their cargo and run for cover
oates scrambles to safe ground quickly and instinctively looking around wildly to read the situation
price dives next to him
a soldier is hit and goes down nearby staggering towards price and oates
the wounded soldier reaches for oates who darts out quickly and drags the injured rebel to safety
price has his cameras out at once and is firing away
two rebel soldiers point to the stretcher of coca cola and start moving toward it through the smoke
they want to rescue the soft drinks
price leaps from his bunker and races toward them dangerously waving and shouting as he does
they dont speak english but stop at his craziness
price stops and aims his camera and as he does he motions for the soldiers to continue
as the soldiers move toward the coke price snaps picture after picture
a mortar explosion blows the coca cola to a million bits the two soldiers stop short several more steps and they would have been killed
prices intrusion has accidentally saved them
the two soldiers run toward safety bewildered and scared
gradually the airfield comes back to life
several teams of medics run with stretchers from the hut and begin gathering bodies
rebel soldiers appear from every conceivable shelter and move across the field
oates emerges and meets price on the torn up runway amidst the rubble
they look around at the devastation
well i guess we know where the guvmint is
cynically you can walk to work from here
convenient aint it
oates starts to walk away then stops and speaks earnestly as if trying to connect to a real world that doesnt exist
my brother just got married
i dont know your brother
suddenly the distant roar of a jet
all the soldiers on the field scan the horizon price looks up
the air raid siren goes off
jet streaks overhead and instead of rockets and bombs it drops something else the sky is filled with a million pieces of paper the jet pulls out and disappears
all is quiet again as the million papers flutter in the sky above the airfield
out of frustration a single soldier fires a couple of shots at the paper
price grabs a piece of paper out of the air
it is he stares at the image and turns it over
there is writing on the backside in spanish and russian
he looks around
oates wanders over with a handful of the leaflets
great shit eh
price tries to read the writing on the back as oates looks at a leaflet familiarly
gummint offers this house to any cuban pilot flying migs for the rebels who chooses to defect to america with a russian jet
we know they aint gonna run off with no planes but the rebs dont theyre scared
they start thinking about that swimming pool
damn near smell that chlorine
starts workin on em and pretty soon they dont let the cubies near a mig
use their own spook pilots and destroy their own air force in a week
guaran fuckin teed
proudly smartest guys in the world
afterthought hey you gotta scoop here eh
youll be famous
oates shakes hands with price who looks at the picture
looking around i gotta run
have a good one
oates heads off across the runway as papers continue blowing down out of the sky price looks up and speaks to himself
i love africa
claire stryder reads a report over the telephone as she times the call with a stopwatch
a photograph of claires high school aged daughter sits on her dresser
alex grazier struggles with his tie and a drink at a dresser in the adjoining room
their connected rooms are littered with hand washed laundry and the paraphernalia of their trade typewriters tape decks books notes pictures
their love affairs of three years is ending
on the phone
and so this strange war that features two provincial governments three rival liberation fronts and at least twenty five tribal associations grinds into its seventh year
alex picks up a melodica a novelty wind instrument and tries to court her with caravan as she files her story
though mildly put off she maintains her cool throughout the call
he thinks hes paul desmond
the battle for the airfield at abou deia is just another chapter in this endless story
from ndjamena chad this is claire stryder
beat no you didnt hear any music must be the connection
she hangs up and rises more irritated than angered
alex dont play that god damn thing when im filing
beat were late
quickly expressed her anger passes
its my party well be late
you called it a strange war and an endless story
if you filed that story for me id say you were editorialishing
i like to editorialize
alex loves to be melo dramatic and is quite conscious of his ability to charm
hes also aware that its worn off with her
only with the memories of making love with you on the plains of fianga as the first army of liberation marched in and opened fire
and freed the proletariat
alex raises a drink
im going to the party without you
she leaves he quickly puts on his coat and follows her
christ i dont want to go to this stupid party
im bad at false modesty
youre great at it
she straightens his half tied tie in an act of familiar affection rather than motherliness
she speaks calmly this is ground they have already covered
alex youre going to make a great anchorman in new york and undoubtedly i could be a pulitzer prize winning hostess but im not going with you
you can work out of the east coast
well get a place on long island and burn our suitcases
i still like suitcases
every saturday night well have a party
invite all our friends sit out on the veranda and interview each other
ive done all that
beat changes tack well god dammit im getting tired of memorizing whos the president of the
republic of maldives
mamoon abdul gayoom
yeah he succeeded mamoon abdul gayeem
they both smile slightly as the elevator comes to a stop
the door doesnt open and the light flickers
and im tired of third world elevators
he bangs the door with his fist
it opens and they enter a dismal hallway
the sounds of a party come from beyond
dont leave me
i already have
as they approach the door to the party he speaks with new toughness
fuck abou deia and new york
im going to nicaragua with you
ive heard its a neat little war with a nice hotel
a cheer goes up for alex as he and claire enter
party hats booze hand made signs reading bon voyage etc
fifteen journalists of varying nationalities cover this backwater war
though both upset they act as if everything is normal
price stands on a chair at the center summoning alex who moves through the group with ease instantly at home
price holds up a bottle of champagne in toast
alex get up here
alex climbs on a chair next to price who puts his arm around him
to the man who gave me my first job and fired me from my first job
and gave me my second job
and fired you from your second job
just a few words alex
cant be done
however miserable alex shines in these situations
he raises his hand silence
you may be asking yourself what exactly are you doing here in this strange war just another chapter in an endless story
that grinds into its seventh year
claire slips to the side bar and pours herself a drink watching alex and shaking her head with some affection
jimmy the cab driver enters with a cake covered with candles
the crowd parts for the cake shaped like the country of chad
the crowd begins singing caravan in a half drunken tribute to a man they like and respect
price moves around the room taking pictures of the party it is all casual silly fun
through camera p
s of alex in a party hat whip pan to cabby with the cake whip pan to drunken journalists
through camera p
of claire freeze frame pan follows her as she moves through the room freeze frame she picks up another drink and leaves through a side door freeze alex gives in
and joins the singing enjoying his own tribute once he has managed to give in to it
claires face is also covered with tears as she smokes wandering idly among clothespinned photos
a part of her life is ending life with alex but its not ending neatly
a row of hanging photographs catches her eye
she stops and looks closely then laughs in spite of herself at a series of pictures photo of a tall african native with a cock so claire pulls the photo
of alex and her from the clip and looks at it
i didnt know you were here
sure you did
you were taking pictures of me all over the room
you looked great
why arent you partying
in a minute
he notices the picture shes looking at
i printed that up for alex
it wouldnt be the greatest thing you could give him right now
beat we just split up
jesus im sorry
who left who this time
im the villain
i thought it could be a little cleaner this time me in central america him in new york
thats pretty clean
but hes decided to go to nicaragua too
to cover you or the war
to cover everything
price moves behind her and gently kisses her on the ear
she smiles quickly and nervously
he kisses her on the neck
for godsakes russell listen
the sounds of the party can be heard
he ignores them and moves around her trying to kiss her on the lips
she puts her hand over his mouth
price reacts strongly flaring slightly and withdrawing
i dont want to wait for you again
weve been circling each other since the montreal olympics
youre a genius of bad timing
beat im going back to the party
she heads to the door price stays
she stops before getting there hesitates then pulls the photo of the elephant from the string and returns to price handing him the photo
this is a great shot
ive heard the light in nicaraguas even better
he doesnt respond
they stand for several moments the sounds of the party get louder
she turns and heads to alexs celebration leaving price alone in the darkroom
price looks at claire as she leaves stares aimlessly for several moments then focuses back on his photo of the gradually pull back to reveal other magazines candy cigars nicaraguan
toys all in a corner shop and finally a fire truck leads a procession through the streets a group of middle class nicaraguan women carry a banner that reads our revolution is in christ in spanish followed by three catholic priests in bright robes followed by a sound truck with p
system followed by hundreds of townspeople carrying banana leaves and religious signs
all are singing a catholic hymn in a swaying hypnotic rhythm
small red and black flags are scattered throughout
a cab driving through the streets runs into the parade and stops
price sits in the front seat his luggage is tied precariously to the roof
the trunk of the cab has been smashed in beyond repair
price hops out of the cab with his camera bag he doesnt know what the parade is about but it looks great
he hands the cabbie some money to stay nearby
he runs to join the procession
price hops onto the running board of the fire truck and almost simultaneously his light meter is out
he is surrounded by images small girls dressed as angels line the street price is quickly taking pictures of everything changing cameras occasionally taking a quick light reading his actions
are instinctive and automatic
suddenly ten young teenagers burst into the parade they wear red and black handkerchiefs baseball caps and strange masks
they are chanting rafael rafael rafael
libre o muerte
a large painting of the face of rafael is carried aloft on a stick draped with red and black scarves
price photographs the boys and the painting
national guard soldiers shove into the parade up and down the street they spring into action running for position with their guns
an ice cream vendor is knocked down a mother clutches her angel daughter another child is whisked inside a door as the soldiers break into the procession
the muchachos with rafael turn to run but realize that the soldiers have cut off their escape
three soldiers break into the parade and are separated from the boys only by a group of priests
trapped the boys panic but as the soldiers push towards them the priests block the soldiers and intentionally scuffle with them allowing the boys just enough time to dart into
one of the boys drops the picture of rafael as he heads in the door
the crowd pushes forward the route to the door is blocked off and the boys escape
soldiers find the portrait of rafael and shoot it full of holes with their automatic weapons
price photographs rafael as his image is ripped to shreds with bullets
the singing and the parade march on
overlooking managua is a sub tropical paradise that seems far removed from a brutal civil war this one time tourist watering hole serves as home base to the international press
the cab pulls up and price gets out
the driver unties his luggage from the roof as two press corps members recognize price and greet him as an old friend
alex sits with a beautiful nicaraguan woman at a table as press corps members mingle
a man we will come to know as hub kittle dressed new york casual table hops in the b
price sees alex and sneaks over to drop the time magazine over his shoulder onto the table in front of him
without looking up alex knows price has arrived
welcome to managua
they shake hands warmly and price sits down
price points to the cover as a beer is served
you have something to do with this
i thought of calling your photographs pictures from a lost war
im great at captions the new york editors loved it since none of them knew where the hell chad was anyway it legitimized their ignorance got you a cover me
a feature and packaged a class struggle in two words
russell acknowledges isela cruz sitting with alex
im russell price
this is isela cruz
she works for the hotel and helps out as a translator
in the background claire walks into the pool bar area she carries her handbag and some papers she stops short seeing price sitting with alex
she hesitates starts toward them stops and sits down at the bar at the opposite end of the pool
price sees her and she sees price
they pretend they dont
price turns to isela and launches into a stream of broken chauvinistic spanish with his usual elegance
in spanish looks like you guys have a lot of bang bang down here eh
little misunderstanding between the poets and the government
down here its called a war
it started in nineteen thirty
before you were born
my spanish is a little out of shape whatd he say
he said he considers it an honor to be able to photograph our war
price looks at each of them and decides not to push
russells got a way with words
i can tell
youre a helluva translator
im much in demand around here
will you excuse me
if you have any questions just ask
alex stands to help isela from her chair
price presses on instinctively and effortlessly
who is rafael
it depends who you ask
alex turns to isela who stops as she rises
he is either a marxist dupe of russia and cuba
beat or the most popular leader of a most popular democratic revolution
to price cynically take your pick
i dont really give a damn
but the guys got a great face
a beat then price asks his question almost sexually as if he thinks he could seduce isela rafael the whole war
how would he like to be photographed
youd never find him
wanta lay odds
you would lose
beat you must excuse me
she starts to leave again and again he stops her
just one more thing is rafael owned by the c
or the k
ill figure out the rest
isela seems to welcome the question
her tone is less flip and she focuses hard on price
the world is not divided into east and west anymore
it is divided into north and south
by the time you people figure that out it will be too late
beat congratulations on your cover
she touches his time magazine kisses alex on the cheek and floats magically through the pool area
price frames her with his fingers as if composing a shot
of isela through prices fingers isela kisses another journalist grabs someones hand and lands gracefully at another table
so far this wars got it all over africa
youre gonna have a ball
alex places his hand over prices frame blocking out his view of the sexy isela
though alexs tone is gentle the threat is obvious
i need an interpreter more than you do right now
price takes the hint
you still hanging in there with claire
alex chooses his words carefully and speaks slowly
im hanging in there like an interim post war government waiting for the palace to be overrun
by younger men
silence and an uneasiness that alex intended
price manages a smile
alex smiles disarmingly
claire rises at the opposite bar picks up her papers and heads straight for the two men with a bounce in her step
both men are a bit surprised at her entrance and she hands a stack of mail to alex
when did you get in
she shakes prices hand in a friendly manner that comes out awkwardly then races past the moment to address and entertain both men
youre not going to believe this i just beat you guys and everybody else here to a story
she teases them exclusive
eat your heart out
whatd ya get
ive just been promised a private interview with tacho
the bastard wont talk to me
they turn to price as if everyone knows who tacho is
thats president somozas nickname
i dont know who the players are yet
want me to order you a hot dog and a program
a bit of tension and awkwardness claire quickly takes control and changes the tone
no fighting after six at night all right
beat cmon weve all got something to celebrate
corrugated metal roofs thatched hut booths a strange combination of decorative and architectural devices
daisy williams a large black woman from nicaragua sings i left my heart in san francisco with a mediocre jazz group
hub kittle is present and other journalists drop by the table to say hello
a boy photographer aims an ancient bellows type polaroid at a booth in which claire sits between alex and price
they are holding a pose indefinitely while the boy struggles with the camera
they hold up the time cover and a couple of beers in celebration and when he finally snaps the picture no flash
the boy puts the camera down disappointedly
in broken english sometimes it doesnt work
the three journalists relax their pose
let me look
on the bandstand daisy has just finished san francisco and spots alex motioning to him
ladeez and genmun hep me get aaleex ov here
daisy applauds lightly for alex to join them
alex is equally pleased and embarrassed
theres not many piano bars left where im still welcome
if she cant sing in the key of c im in trouble
alex excuses himself and joins daisy on the bandstand
price and claire are left alone in the booth as price hands the repaired camera back to the boy
alex at the piano begins a slow easy cocktail version of stardust the song of his generation perhaps and he seems happy seduced by his own chords
price and claire resume their pose and this time the camera flashes
price pays for the picture from the boy
at first there is a moment of awkwardness between them
you finished your assignment in chad
got africa all wrapped up and pouched to my editor
she smiles and relaxes a bit at the typical price remark
youre going to love this war russell
theres good guys bad guys cheap shrimp
an afterthought and alex is still singing in the background
beat i missed you
we gotta get alone somewhere to talk
alex begins singing as he plays
he sings like a trumpet player no voice but great phrasing
he half smiles as he sings enjoying the song and enjoying making them uncomfortable
sometimes i wonder why i spend these lonely nights dreaming of a song
hes doing it on purpose
alex is one of the worlds leading experts on military strategy
they dont really want to talk about alex though his presence is unavoidable
price changes gears gets slightly goofy and steers the conversation to more comfortable turf
well hell i just got off the boat
gimme the scoop on nicaragua
about sixty years ago the u
marines invaded to protect american business interests and put down a peasant revolt led by a little man who wore a giant cowboy hat his name was augusto sandino
in nineteen thirty four he was murdered at a peace conference and the somoza family has ruled ever since
no no no
i dont mean the stuff about the peasants i mean the real stuff
she knows what he means but she wants to tease him a bit first
the real stuff
you mean a history of class struggle in agrarian societies
beat just a couple things
beat one theres only two kinds of beer available tona and victoria
beat and two if you see miss panama hanging around the hotel bar hot hot hot but dont touch
she belongs to tacho and if anybody gets caught with her then el presidente has promised to personally cut off the guys
unsure which word to use pecker
and throw it into lake managua
and the lakes already polluted
price is impressed and yet another new face drops by the booth they both recognize and see him coming a contemporary of price regis flynn a scraggly british journalist who
heads over to their table holding three beers
mutters to claire is there anybody here we dont know
regis slides into their booth happy to see them
kudos on the african snaps
shakes hands a perfunctory kiss on her cheek jeez claire i havent seen you since
three mile island
wistfully holiday inn right
he nods they all sip beers and watch alex sing
a teenage dishwasher looks around nervously then pulls a paper sack from off the shelf removing a strange mask from it
he pulls the mask over his head
then from the bag he removes a hand made zip gun puts a bullet in it and darts into the shadows of a nook waiting
back to the booth where regis softly croons a few bars of stardust into claires mike
the three of them are having a good time mildly drunk at best and uninhibited
as we hear alexs gentle rendition of the standard a necking couple moves back into the shadows of the club
each pulls on a mask as in the b
the man somehow out of place dresses with casual continental style not overdone but expensive and tasteful clearly from another world
he wears a neat hat and moves gracefully
isela looks stunning dressed for the evening
the doorman greets them familiarly
isela casually checks her watch as they enter the club
the masked couple in the shadows check their watches
as isela and the man enter commanding attention without trying
isela stops at the piano long enough to kiss alex gently before sitting in the booth with the man
in prices booth the new arrivals have caught their attention price and alex still clown slightly and claire teases them
louis jordan walks in and im sitting with the everly brothers
before you fall in love thats marcel jazy
friend of wine women and somoza
they say hes a businessman
interrupting hes a businessman in search of a business
he doesnt try very hard to cover up his connections to the but look at his moves can the c
light cigarettes like that
whats wrong with the everly brothers
the waiter arrives at prices booth and sets down three shrimp cocktails and more champagne as it opens quickly and three more men in masks enter quickly
back to the booth as the waiter speaks with a firm coolness
please stay at your table and you wont be hurt
another masked face comes out of the kitchen the dishwasher waves a gun
door the woman carries an automatic rifle and guards the entrance
three masked faces appear almost materialize from thin air moving silently and without commotion
the music winds down slowly
six guerrillas total a guerrilla quickly sprays an image on the wall with a few deftly drawn strokes the face of rafael magically appears
the name rafael is written under the face then other names and revolutionary slogans
as this takes place businessman the middle aged well dressed local sits with his wife and two other men
they freeze in fear the nightclub freezes as the guerrillas take control of the room swiftly and smoothly
one guerrilla faces the nicaraguan businessman at the table and speaks loudly but without panic
the masked guerrillas around the room are serious but nervous
in spanish we do not want to waste any ammunition on a head as empty as yours but we will
in spanish what is this
in spanish shut up
the businessman refuses
the guerrilla leader takes a hand grenade from his pocket and pulls the pin without hesitation then holds the grenade in front of him fearlessly inches away from the businessmans
the businessman rises slowly
the leader motions toward the back door of the club
in spanish you are coming with us you will not be hurt we will trade you for the release of some nicaraguans who care about nicaragua
the woman with the gun shoves it into the mans head forcing him to move toward the kitchen door
price takes pictures quickly with a tiny camera that fits into the palm of his hand
neatly surreptitiously and calmly price is coolest in any crisis
claire punches on her tiny tape recorder instinctively and a tiny red light comes on
the businessman is shoved to the door he hesitates afraid to leave the room
the guerrilla shoves the grenade in his face the woman sticks the gun into his neck even deeper
bandstand alex trips over the drum set slightly a clanging clash of cymbals startles everyone and as the drama freezes innocently the young boy struts out of the kitchen to
see whats going on and as he does the door strikes the arm of the guerrilla with the grenade and the grenade is knocked free for an instant everything freezes and the grenade rolls across the floor daisy williams the singer runs away screaming as the grenade comes to rest near a crowded section of the club
a guerrilla guarding the side door rushes for it picks it up and as he does the grenade explodes in the guerrillas hand a brutal explosion the ceiling caves in
partially the musical instruments explode and the sandinista guerrillas dart from the room through various doors
the boy photographer lies bloodied
the guerrilla who picked up the grenade is a barely recognizable corpse
the businessman is soiled but unhurt
one half of the club breaks out in flame as a broken gas pipe feeds a sudden outburst of fire the clubs patrons panic screaming and shoving towards the door
as the room lights up and prices light meter is out at once followed quickly by a mm camera quickly clicking off picture after picture of the club amid the flames and panic
the new light makes his job easier
price takes a light reading near the body of the boy photographer
he sees the boys camera lying nearby
price puts away his light meter and feels the boys pulse then puts his ear to the boys heart making sure he is not still alive
the chaos of a busy cramped telex room
a switchboard several journalists trying to place phone calls
press come and go coffee cigarettes and half eaten sandwiches
claire tears a story off the telex while price stands to the side of the action eating a sandwich and watching
alex stands at the center of it all established as the senior figure or one of them to whom other younger journalists come for information
a young journalist a time stringer is slightly distraught on the phone and interrupts alexs dealing with others cupping the phone to announce its charlie from new york says that
a terrorist bombing of a central american restaurant isnt big enough to hold for the world section
tell him we have pictures
tell him there were pieces of body in the piano and somebody was singing i left my heart in san francisco
beat whats he got better than that
hes got the pope visiting egypt
alex grabs the phone in disgust and launches in
forget the pope charlie
every week you got the pope somewhere
this is a very big story down here because its the first sign of fighting in managua
beat yeah well get a map and look up nicaragua ya drive to new orleans and turn left
while charlie argues on the other end of the phone alex initials papers and performs several jobs at once
like hell im editorializing the whole thing happened in a roomful of c
what do you want
beats how do i know they were c
they wore name tags what do you think
were backing a fascist again i know that aint news but see if you can find an angle
hub kittle has been floating through the room and upon hearing the word fascist takes offense and approaches alex
theres fascists and then theres fascists right
be careful how you throw words like that around
alex ignores hub though he is slightly pestered by him and continues on the phone as he initials papers brought to him
we dont have any pictures of rafael because nobody knows where the son of a bitch is and anybody crazy enough to go after him
alex spots price who is standing nearby still eating a sandwich still enjoying the high energy buzz of the room
alex directs his next line so that price cannot fail to get the message
alex plays the moment coolly
is liable to get his nuts shot off
hub nods seriously in agreement
alex hangs up grumbling then turns his attention to the persistent hub kittle
yeah well gbye
to hub who the fuck are you
extending a hand hub kittle
im with lewitsky and knupp new york
we have a client down here
alex is irritated but fascinated
alex is incredulous that somoza employs a new york p
hub is professionally used to this reaction no panic
i know i know
beat but theres an untold story here
i mean the man has a point of view too right
alex turns to leave hub corners him
we got a national anthem contest going on right now and you guys are ignoring it
lotta human interest
alex turns to other business though hub persists
elsewhere in the room a young nicaraguan woman is talking to claire
she seems to be part of the local press
i want you to get me copies of the government inventory lists of all captured guerrilla weapons
i want to know if the guns are israeli belgian russian cuban
the guerrillas are not supplied by anybody from the outside
fine give me proof
a telephone operator calls to claire through the chaos
su hija su hija
your daughter from los angeles
claire sighs at the bad timing but seems delighted to be interrupted by her daughter and brushes aside a stringer forcing paperwork upon her
claire takes the phone into a bare adjacent hallway for some privacy
in a bare hallway claire talks to her daughter
how are you
beat has grandmother spoiled you silly by now
beats yes i got your letter with the picture of your new boyfriend
hes very good looking
but hes a bit old isnt he
just how old is he
from the telex room to claire price knows this is not his world and he wanders outside
price bounces along whistling san francisco
an occasional guardia jeep or taxi rumbles past
he strolls up the walkway of a house from which comes a strange blue glow
blue walls bare bulbs several pictures on the wall and an old woman lying in a hammock
music in the b
price approaches her and hands her a bill there is a brief negotiation of the black market value
in broken spanish cuanto
she shrugs declaring the negotiation ended and leaves the room to change the dollar into cordobas
price idly studies the pictures on the wall price smiles and turns right into a sharp bayonet mounted to a rifle held threateningly by a guardia soldier
the small room is filled with national guards we havent heard them enter over the sounds of music and our preoccupation with the pictures
what is this
im a journalist
price pulls a thick passport and press credentials from a pocket handing them to the officer in charge
the officer looks at prices passport photo studies it briefly and takes the passport
a rifle butt is jammed violently into prices belly he doubles over
the officer nods and price is led away
as the guard hauls him outside the old woman appears in the doorway with a stack of local currency
price is led into a dark cell where another prisoner lies in street clothes on the floor
the prisoner is spat upon by the guards and kicked awake
padre puta padre puta padre puta
in spanish to price here is a priest for you to confess your sins
the guards laugh and leave
the prisoner rises to his feet
price keeps his distance
the prisoner looks in bad shape
price hands him a cigarette and lights it
a long deep drag
the man nods in broken spanish what are you doing here
in spanish the government accused me of using the church to hide rebels and guns
in spanish governments are always wrong eh
in spanish this time theyre right
who are you
in spanish un periodista
in spanish whose side are you on
in spanish i dont take sides
i take pictures
in spanish no sides
in spanish no
the prisoner priest looks at price with disdain
periodista puta todos periodistas son putas
all journalists are whores the prisoner sits down in the corner ignoring price who is surprised to be treated so despicably
quietly go home
price is led into a lineup of people all nicaraguans
the room is narrow and so brightly lit that at first he covers his eyes
figures move in the shadows a guardia soldier moves up and down the lineup stopping to point at a prisoner
in the line we recognize the waiter from the viking club
price speaks to the soldier in a calm reasoned tone
mi amigo mala interpretacion eh
the soldier whirls at price in a rage out of all proportion to prices tone shouting in spanish shut up
price holds up his hands he may be fearless but hes not stupid
the soldier pulls a knife then pulls his own tongue from his mouth and makes motions with the knife as if cutting out his tongue
the message is clear price doesnt speak
the soldier walks up to the waiter and points
the waiter is frightened
through the shadows we see an officer talking with a civilian in a hat
the civilian points to a door
the waiter is led away through a door protesting desperately as he goes
the soldier moves to the next prisoner he too is led away
this repeats itself until the soldier arrives at price
through the shadows the civilian is in a discussion with the officer it is clear that his opinion affects the decisions
for a moment price doesnt know where hes going to be led
the civilian points to a different door it opens and price steps down off the display rack into a room
through the door as price steps through the action continues with the other nicaraguan prisoners
price looks around quickly but the civilian and officer are gone
he is quickly shown into a bare office
pictures on the wall of somoza and the flag raising at iwo jima
prices cameras and bag sit on a desk
the civilian through a door it is marcel jazy his rumpled elegance is at odds with the brutal surroundings
the door closes
a senior officer enters the bare room and price addresses him at once
soy un periodista
in excellent english mr
you must accept our deepest apologies for the misunderstanding
somebody saw you taking photographs of terrorists hooligans in the parade and at the nightclub our young officers get carried away
theyre always looking for traitors
that film is half way to new york by now
i know i know
it was all a misunderstanding
una mala interpretacion
the officer reaches for one of prices cameras and hands it to him but as he does the camera drops to the ground and breaks silence the officer would love
for price to get angry
price smiles barely and refuses to pop off
price puts his cameras in his bag and as he is shown from the room he notices a copy of the time magazine with elephant sitting on the desk
price is shown to a door handed over to a soldier and led outside into the night
claire stands at the main doorway surrounded by guards an officer and an unidentified civilian she is arguing with them in rapid spanish not allowing them to get in a
in spanish you throw a journalist in jail it gets in the papers
you walk all over the same press credentials you pass out
i demand to speak to someone in authority or ill go to tacho myself
i dont understand you youre big and strong and handsome but youre not so smart
beat you should be trying to seduce us
price is shown out a door in the background and sees her
they hurry toward each other and embrace briefly
the guards watch it all curiously
im fine whatre you doing here
these guys are goons
they love being beaten up by a woman beat ive been looking for you all night whyd they lock you up
they walk away together
i dont know
jazy got me released
you think theres a story there
stories are all alike
i wanta find rafael
you need help
beat when should we start
i figure you probably want to do a little research on the history of marcel jazys business connections in the third world countries with c
i assumed youd just look him in the eye and say gimme a break for crissakes marcel are you a spy or arent you
marcel jazy stands drink in hand looking slightly rumpled in the daylight slightly older but more charming and self effacing than his first impression indicated
his two story mediterranean style house is in slight disrepair the gardens are scraggly and overgrown
the pool is empty
jazy addresses price and claire
are you a spy or arent you eh
smiling spy is such an odd word mr
nobody is a
russell prefers pictures to words
you dont have to apologize
and youre a businessman
that sounds good
okay im a businessman
why was i arrested and why did you get me released and who are you
as he speaks the questioning comes to a sudden halt as a spectacular looking woman emerges from the shadows of the house into the light of the courtyard
she is tall latin and besides high heels wears only a shiny high fashion swimsuit cut high on the legs
price claire and jazy stop to watch as the woman stops to look into the empty pool
nodding no agua
in spanish oh marcel
you told me there would be water in the pool this week
jazy leans in very coolly to price and claire as he pours an extra glass of wine and speaks softly in english again
if she dove in i assure you she wouldnt notice
he carries the glass of wine to the woman smiling warmly
to miss panama in spanish sweetheart the guerrillas knocked out the pumping station on the road to masaya and we must ration water for the time being
next week maybe things will be better
in spanish maybe i should go back to panama
in spanish maybe you should
jazy pushes a lounge chair over to her and hands her a glass of wine
the woman unfolds gracefully into a lounge chair in the sun
she reaches for and kisses jazys hand affectionately he kisses her forehead
she feels better now
jazy motions for claire and price to follow him inside
the pool is visible in b
his house like the pool is rumpled and slightly sloppy though it betrays the taste of its occupant books everywhere pictures on the wall nothing cheap or tacky but everything
is well worn
you were arrested because the guardia are clowns who specialize in excess
you were released because i told them to release you
these are not the normal duties of a businessman
he looks at them directly
but they are the normal duties of a
you win im a spy
smiles there are you happy
i feel better
he refills their glasses
now we can relax
you can turn off your little thing
the red light of her recorder is on
she smiles slightly undisturbed and turns it off
oh i trust you wont say anything to hurt me
in some ways im a terrible spy
i used to be much better at it but now it seems everyone knows who i am
i have too many girlfriends
i like to be photographed
beat i talk too much
price and claire are almost afraid to speak afraid to interrupt this strange performance
i always talk too much
but my girlfriends like that
pointing to the swimsuited woman you know who she is
thats miss panama
do you know who that is
oh yeah yes etc
shes in love with me
ive got to get some water in the pool
beat and once a week i have lunch with president somoza to discuss security measures against the sandinista insurgents but all he wants to talk about is miss panama
hes worried about her
claire interrupts with a smile
because he thinks shes seeing another man
jazy smiles slightly before confirming
and he assigned me to find out who the man is
they all smile at this complication
price is impressed
jazy changes the subject with fluent and disturbing ease
we all know the revolutionaries are going to win dont we
they dont know how to respond
they all are slightly entertained and glad for the relief
unsure what to say next price notices a picture on the wall the same picture we saw on the leaflets in africa
theres a rumor about this picture
some people say youre a genius that you invented this scheme
it was lots of peoples idea
have you been to leon
were going to masaya
they say the rebels have hit the cuartel
its supposed to be nasty there
a lotta people think rafaels in the south
i want to find out
no no its not nasty yet
another week maybe
beat you would love leon
a nice cathedral and beautiful light
et un peu de bang bang
were not doing a travelogue you understand
of course of course
only i have heard that comandante rafael has recently had his unit in the area
surprised rafael is near leon
its a rumor what do i know
the voice of miss panama
dont let us stand in the way
its my job
beat you think i talk too much
he doesnt wait for an answer but excuses himself and goes out to tend to miss panama
of jazy and miss panama by the empty pool as jazy touches her whispers and she waves to claire and price
price lathers up with shaving cream for the first time cleaning up
as he applies the lather he stops and slowly draws a face on the mirror with shaving cream until he is staring at a rented car with white flags turns
onto the road to leon
price drives eats and reads a map
claire takes the map from him and reads it herself
they seem to enjoy their first moment alone without alex looking over their shoulder
a small band aid is on prices clean shaven cheek
did you dream about miss panama last night
i dreamed about you
have a good time
she reaches out and touches his band aid
and old war injury flaring up
is the tape on
i was on the deck of the u
pueblo catching some rays when the north koreans attacked
took a bullet right in the chest but by luck i had an extra roll of high speed ektachrome in this pocket right here
over the heart
and the bullet ricocheted off the film grazed your cheek and saved your life
you heard about it
i was lucky
passing shot of a cluster of roadside crosses marking a series of graves
immediately the tone in claires voice changes sobered by the reminder of war
did anyone ever die next to you in combat
what did you do
at a sixtieth
thats an old joke
my question was serious
so was i
beat you ever dream about me
how was i
again their glibness is interrupted by what they came to see
even as they joke they watch the landscape with concern
refugees are streaming out of leon mostly women and children some old men carrying their possessions
soldiers stand around
im basically a coward russell i hope you understand that
i hope we dont get shot
the press car pulls up to a stop
price and claire get out quickly hand their credentials to a soldier and open the trunk and the hood
as the car is searched they look down at the city
from several places in the town
the sound of gunfire
to soldier in spanish i thought it was quiet here
in spanish quiet
are you sure you want to go down there
the soldier laughs at the journalists and hands back the credentials
in spanish you must leave the car here
price speaks in english knowing he cant be understood
to soldier you thinking of scoring a toyota
in spanish no problem we leave the car
price and claire remove their things from the car and price takes the distributor cap as well as the keys
they walk over and look down the road leading into the city under seige
more refugees evacuate the town it is a most uninviting sight
the plane passes over the town in the distance firing rockets
price responds by flashing his light meter in the air taking a quick nervous reading
where the fuck we going
looking around warily as they go they are the only people entering the town
claire speaks softly into her tape recorder as they walk in recording the event without editorializing
the evacuation of leon
a woman carries a pig
signs for the f
the body of a young man lies ignored on the sidewalk
they continue walking and soon come to price and claire duck into a doorway protected in effect by the government soldiers who wait silently guns ready around the corner of
we see what theyre waiting for
a young sandinista comes out of a building a block away holding a handgun
momentarily confused he begins running toward us toward the soldiers waiting in ambush
the guerrilla races quickly to his waiting death and as he turns the corner right into a dozen guardia troops the guardia guns open up on the young guerrilla killing
claire turns her head away unable to watch
the guardia follow the tanquetta slowly down the street toward the rebel youths house
suddenly the intersection is empty
price and claire move down a sidestreet slowly as several guerrilla muchachos dart out of an alley with sharpened sticks a spear gun and one home made gun
the muchachos hesitate briefly lost and see price
the muchachos quickly pose for a picture motioning for price to record them
they pose instantly in tough guy posture
price takes their picture and just as quickly they dart away through a bombed out building
three sandinistas leap off a rooftop and race toward claire and price who freeze russell
for a moment they arent sure what this means are they in trouble
the sandinistas shove past the two journalists pushing open a doorway and disappearing inside
for a moment price and claire are alone on the street
the door opens again slowly and a middle aged woman appears motioning for them to come inside
the three sandinistas dressed half in khaki half recycled disco are pleading with a young man pedro
in spanish you must come and help us
one more time
in spanish no please
one of the sandinistas brings pedro his rumpled baseball jersey from another room
in spanish for leon
pedro sees price and claire and is more interested in them
he speaks in broken but understandable english
pedro lights up and runs to a shelf where he returns with a baseball he is signing
i put my autograph on this ball
in spanish pedro
there is no time to waste
pedro is more interested in the two americans
when you get back to the united states i want you to give this ball to tippy martinez for me
he is from nicaragua
pedro hands claire the baseball as the sandinistas plead with pedro for his help
he is more interested in getting the baseball delivered to tippy martinez
claire accepts the ball graciously exchanges awkward glances with price and puts it in her shoulder bag
in spanish enrique is dead
roberto has disappeared
the guardia has the church and we need you
to claire and price you come eh
to the sandinistas can they come with us
they go to the door and open it a crack to look out
the tanquetta passes as soldiers kick open doors across the street
the sandinistas go to a corner of the room and push a book shelf out of the way
a large hole has been broken in the wall
they climb through the hole into the living room of the next house the woman pushes the shelf back over the hole with great effort
a family huddles in the corner as the man of the house pulls back a couch and a hanging blanket revealing another hole knocked in the wall
the sandinistas pedro claire and price scramble through
through a series of door sized holes in the walls of all the houses on the block connecting the homes with a secret passageway
the six of them race through the houses each hole opening and then closing magically
the three sandinistas pedro claire and price emerge
a woman runs the cafe and welcomes them
the six crawl so as not to be seen from the street they stop long enough to survey the plaza
half a dozen bodies are scattered across the plaza
otherwise it is empty
six guardia snipers in the church tower control the plaza
as we watch they fire off occasional shots in different directions there is no way to cross the plaza
the woman pulls a tray of contact bombs from the oven home made grenades that look like muffins on a tray
pedro grabs one and pretends to bite into it
the sandinistas start to laugh and catch themselves as pedro clowns
claire and price arent sure what the muffins are and dont respond mostly they are on edge
the contact bombs are put in a sack
the woman opens a trap door in the floor and the six of them climb down a ladder into a tunnel
pedro leads them with a candle through a dark passage under the street
overhead we hear gunfire
rats scurry and water runs through an open sewer
a tapestry rug is pulled away and pedros head appears
he climbs out and soon all the party is in the church
a priest leads them quickly through an immense nearly
european interior of ornate altars and burning candles
the small party is led to a small corner of the sanctuary where a long rickety ladder leads up to the roof
the sandinistas scramble up the ladder as it sways
pedro follows with his sack of contact bombs
then price goes up as the priest holds the ladder
the american is much larger than the nicaraguans the ladder squeaks and sways and when he is nearly at the top the ladder cracks as price reaches the top and
is helped to safety
the priest steadies the ladder now made unsafe and clearly claire wants to go onto the roof
in spanish no please
its not safe
you must come with me
claire looks at price she wants to go on the roof but the sound of close gunfire settles the dilemma
claire hurries off to safety with the priest
onto a lower level of the cathedral rooftop where a body lies
they are exposed immediately and automatic weapons fire opens up on them the sandinistas flatten against a wall quickly becoming separated from price and pedro
two sandinistas race for cover behind a cupola in a move that is equally daring and foolish
the diversion draws fire from the two soldiers
prices light meter is instantly out taking readings as pedro huddles with him curious at this strange act
as they hide behind the cupolas
the hidden third guerrilla opens fire killing a guardia soldier and the other soldier races for the belltower
as he does the sandinistas seize the moment to rush closer waving to pedro who slips along a wall with his bag of bombs
price starts to follow but is pinned down by fire and chooses to take refuge halfway in an alcove
as fire from both sides ricochets all over the rooftop price switches camera lenses seemingly oblivious to the action
pedro meets one of the sandinistas in a protected niche and quickly they are unfolding his bag setting the muffin bombs out on the rooftop
the other two sandinistas open heavy fire and briefly draw heavier fire from the belltower as pedro picks up a muffin weighing it briefly in his hand like a pitcher
he studies the surroundings runners on first and third no outs he spits in his left his pitching hand and rubs it in casually
pedro crosses himself goes into an abbreviated pitching motion then rears and fires the muffin toward the belltower window exposing himself as he does
pedro throws another into the tower another explosion
a guardia soldier staggers into the window and a sandinista drops him with a shot
all is quiet
the three sandinistas carefully rush the tower looking in and motion to pedro and price that all is okay and as they do another shot rings out they whirl around
pedro and price drop again
a lone guardia soldier fires at them from the other tower
a third sandinista drops him with a volley of fire again all is quiet
price follows the sandinistas to the first belltower and looks in
five bodies lie scattered and bloodied one of the guerrillas kicks a couple of them to make sure they are dead
in the corner one body lies on top of another
satisfied the sandinistas head for the other tower
price stays behind to take a few pictures and the ever present light meter appears followed by several quick shots of the bodies
then price goes to one of the arched stone windows
he looks out over the city
of leon dusk late in the afternoon now the fighting is over for the day
an occasional gunshot
smoke rises from scattered places throughout the city
there is new rubble
the town is littered with bodies
a man walks in front of it chanting slowly rhythmically hay heridas o muertes aqui
hay heridas o muertes aqui
are there wounded or dead here
we see a woman drag a body out into the street
the red cross man makes small stacks of bodies
he douses the bodies with gasoline and sets the pile aflame
hay heridas o muertes aqui
he thinks he hears something then dismisses it
a voice almost a whisper
you motherfucker price im talking to you
one of the bodies speaks
where are those bastards
are they away
price looks out the sandinistas are on the other side of the roof
this war gets stranger
a body rolls out from under another body
blood splattered smiling wiping the blood from his face
it is oates the mercenary from africa
he peeks out the window the sandinistas are on the other side of the roof
what the fuck are you doing here
what the fuck are you doing here
for a moment they understand that they are there for the same reason they make their livings off war
oates peeks out the window nervously and repeatedly
awright awright youre lookin good
how ya like nicaragua
oates readies his automatic weapon in case its needed routine
price doesnt know how to answer
oates laughs quickly and softly he is tuned into the strangeness of prices answer
shitload o greasers though eh
oates and price see them and oates crawls back under the pile of bodies
the sandinistas look into the belltower all looks quiet and they motion to price
in spanish its getting late come on
the three sandinistas pedro and price are hiding in the shadows of the main church entrance
the sandinistas are carefully peeking around the corner checking out the plaza
it seems safe
the door opens the priest lets claire out
for a moment she looks around to see whos still alive in the shadows price looks like one of the guerrillas
they see each other and embrace briefly
the sandinistas seem to relax
the sandinistas take pride in pedro and pat his left arm for price and claire
san dee koufax no
es mejor que koufax eh
they seem to want approval from the americans
much better than koufax
the sandinistas slap hands familiar with the american gesture
the six start walking across the plaza away from the church
in the b
we see piles of bodies burning the red cross tends to the wounded locals
spirits are high as they walk
the tiny red light glows on claires recorder
koufax is okay
but tippy martinez he is the best
he pitches for the baltimore orioles and some day i will be the second man from nicaragua to play in the major leagues
to price and claire tippy martinez had a good fastball but pedro has a curveball and a screwball that are better
all five of them agree that pedro is the best they slap his valued arm and relax for the first time all day
you will give my autographed baseball to tippy and tell him in five years i will be pitching with him okay
he better watch out for me eh
oates checks the clip on his rifle and looks down into the plaza
to the six walking away he doesnt smile or joke its all business
he aims the rifle
in spanish its too dangerous to return to managua at night
you should stay at the house of hammocks
in spanish gracias
can they get into trouble for keeping us
you are not combatants
would rather talk baseball the baltimore team is my team
a shot rings out and pedros chest explodes in front of us
sudden panic rage confusion the sandinistas whirl and scan the building
oates racing across the cathedral rooftop into the night
price grabs pedros gun and whirls to face the church his action is instinctive angry and electric with energy
claire grabs pedros arm and drags the body to safety though there is no safety and the body is lifeless
her actions are protective and automatic
the sandinistas take control of the situation and move quickly
two of them fan out to cover the escape
price screams in the direction of oates you bastard
claire drags the body near a bench under a tree
what about him
dispassionately hes dead
the sandinistas survey the cathedral and streets carefully warily upset at their nonchalance
they know the sniper is disappearing into the night but they continue to look
i will talk to pedros mother
you must go to the house of the hammocks if you want to be safe
the three sandinistas fan out toward the church as it gets dark
price and claire stand next to pedro feeling helpless and ineffective
they both look at the body
price realizes hes holding pedros gun and places it down next to the body
price notices the tiny red light is still glowing on her tape recorder
he points it out to claire
she turns it off
in a nearly dark room full of hanging hammocks claire sits on the floor lit by a low wattage bulb hanging from a cord
in another room through a door price can be seen with a family in the hammock workshop
claire talks softly into her recorder
hello sweetheart this is your mother
im in leon and i miss you
dont worry about me its not dangerous at all
i guess you cant believe what you hear on the news
ill put this this tape in the mail when i get back to managua but knowing what the mail service is like i may be home before it arrives
i think about you all the time and hope i can make it back before you graduate from jr
as she speaks price bids the family farewell and comes into the room with claire where he lies down in a hammock
i love you and ill finish this letter when i get back to the hotel
claire lies down on a mat exhausted after turning out the light
several moments pass before price speaks
i know who shot pedro
i knew somebody was in the tower
why didnt you tell the guerrillas
i dont know
then they wouldve killed him i guess
i didnt want to interfere
it wasnt an easy choice
i think i made the wrong one
you didnt take any pictures when it was over
beat i picked up a gun
beat is something happening to us
they lie for a long time in the dark
a light in the house is turned off
finally are you asleep
price gets out of the hammock and lies down next to her
they dont speak
she unbuttons his shirt
he unbuttons her blouse
they undress just enough to begin making love softly quietly
the first light of dawn strikes claires bare torso
prices light meter appears at her back price takes a reading then moves the meter to her neck another reading
he moves it down her nude body lit beautifully in the vague light partially covered with a blanket
he scurries across the room stark naked with a camera
price begins photographing her
he moves back to her and gently removes the blanket from the rest of her body
his actions are quiet and easy
he stops frequently to admire her
claire lies sleeping nude except for her socks
price moves around the room picture picture picture
claire wakes up slowly and pulls the blanket back over her
she opens her eyes and sees price sitting in a chair several feet away with his camera
what are you doing
you look beautiful
she realizes what hes been doing
how long have you been doing this
bout ten frames
waitll you see the pictures you look great
her sense of violation is balanced by this notion
for a moment we sense her attitude can go either way outrage or some sense of being flattered however ill conceived
she chooses the latter
ill bet i look great give me the film
after theyre printed
ill develop them myself give it to me or ill start taping what you say in your sleep
price hands her the film and climbs back under the blanket with her
i talk in my sleep
girls names and f stops
they curl up together holding onto each other
a small child crosses the courtyard peeking at them
a rooster crows
call the office
i dont want to go to work today
the peacefulness is shaken by the roar of an engine close by
a helicopter gunship passes over the courtyard they look up jolted out of the moment
the war is back
prices rental car is a smoking wreck
he and claire arrive and she removes a single feeble white flag that remains
they study the car briefly and then turn as a guardia troop carrier lumbers past with a truckload of refugees behind
they wave the flag and catch a ride with the refugees
alex comes out a door chatting with somebody and passes a mini cam crew old friends
how was matagalpa
no bang bang alex
none at all
you find anything
half the press corps
a small laugh
they continue on
alex enters claires room
as he turns to leave he sees some pictures in a stack of papers on her desk
he picks one up
close up a picture of claire sleeping in leon its all over and he knows it
he stares at even admires the image
he puts it down and turns to leave as oh
awkwardly how was leon
alex finally acknowledges that it is over with claire but refuses to say it directly
im tired of nicaragua
you havent been here very long
long enough lets face it you were right
everybody was right
what do you think of em
i like your cheekbones
alex are you all right
this is a face made for television
you decided to go with the network
alex nods then seems to hit the end of his own resilience and gets vitriolic
is he a good fuck
in a simple monologue alex goes from outrage to acknowledgment of what he already knew
thats a reasonable question for a reporter to ask isnt it
beat i shoulda never come down here eh
this is the way its going to be
beat ill make a shitload of money in television for just sitting there
beat im gonna show up to work at rockefeller center every morning and theyre gonna hand me the news with my coffee and toast
beat i shoulda never come down here eh
this war down here belongs to you guys okay
im on tommorrows plane
you want to take me to the airport
beat resigned i shoulda never come down here
a cab pulls up
soldiers stand around everywhere
price claire alex and the cabbie get out
the cabbie takes his bag
take this to check in
ill be right there
price pulls a bottle of wine from his camera bag and sets three styrofoam cups on the cab roof
he hands the cork to alex and shows him the label
sniff this sucker eh
alex does and looks at the label
jesus whered you get this
they toast and drink
hey ill leave you guys alone eh
no no dont be ridiculous
were grownups russell
non acerbically most of us
awkward smile from price
you two wanta happy snap
price makes the motion of taking a picture
they look at him with affection yet astounded again by his inappropriateness
no happy snaps
beat ill just
be over here
he wanders away from the car to give them a moment alone and as he does he pulls the light meter from his pocket flipping it on and off nervously
without looking at it
he wanders idly toward a guardia soldier
the soldier gets nervous
youre sure about him
for the moment
alex considers this he understands whether he wants to or not
the soldier comes face to face with price who backs off to soldier im a personal friend of tachos
smiles disarmingly the soldier stops at tachos name
price turns again embarrassed faces the soldier
dont look huh
beat no mire
the soldier confused turns away and as he does dont get hurt
ahh im a chicken dont worry
beat alex listen to me
within a year youre gonna be one of the ten most admired men in america
alex is amused price is serious
the cabbie comes out and alex heads into the airport
daisy and her combo from the viking club perform the girl from ipanema as one hundred press members and v
s sit at long tables in the garden
the pleasantness of the surroundings is countered by the presence of dozens of soldiers in the background guarding the house etc
visible at the head table are two generals and their wives mrs
elsewhere mingling are jazy isela price regis
an elaborate array of food sits on the table
overlooking the gathering from his private living room somoza grants claire her interview
he close the window to muffle the singing
youre late to your own luncheon mr
president we can schedule this for another time
nonsense let them wait
we are a stunning couple eh
my stomach is very flat ive been working out
we are a stunning couple
president you own one fifth of all the land in nicaragua you own the shipping port the national airlines the mercedes dealership
i am on a salt free diet
he takes her hand and leads her to two large portraits hanging on a wall his parents
do you always hold hands with reporters
ignores her this is my mother and father
they were very special to me
every sunday morning i drive out to the cemetery and put flowers on their grave
i think people should know that
would you care to comment on the fall of leon to the rebels
somoza just smiles unaffected by her questions she knows the game is undaunted
hub kittle is bending prices ear in the crowd
price seems ammused and watches the anthem contest as he munches food
listen russell lets grow up
its very easy to fall in love with the underdog eh
but theres an upside and downside to this thing just wanta remind you
this stuff about a revolution of poets is crap
but its great p
so whats the upside
and it could happen
somoza destroys the terrorist insurgents rebuilds the country shitcans the purveyors of excess stabilizes the cordoba and is finally beloved as the savior of nicaragua
beat our pal
got a smoke
price gives him a cigaret
whats the downside
the commies take over the world
its simple and hub is pleased with his presentation
a soldier moves through the crowd looking quite out of place finds hub and hands him a note
hub reads it seems delighted and excuses himself from the table
excuse me gentlemen but the war may be over
price and regis look at each other strangely whats he talking about
they shrug regis bites into a papaya and hub hurries inside
price and regis watch the singer
my people love me
my stomach is flat
did i say that already
it is flat
there are reports that the guardia operates a torture chamber at coyotepe
somoza ignores the question and reopens the window flooding the room with the tony bennett classic
i like this song
since the earthquake in destroyed half of managua over three hundred million dollars in foreign relief aid have poured into the country yet nothing has been re built
it is said that the money has gone into your pocket
i love the press i really do
some of my best friends are journalists
ecuador mexico peru brazil and panama are reportedly on the verge of breaking off diplomatic relations with your regime
would you comment
hub kittle and an officer burst into the room interrupting the interview
something has happened
somoza initially lashes out at them the first time weve seen him lose his cool then recovers
in spanish i am busy
get out of here at once or ill put my foot up your ass
the officer seems familiar with these tirades and grabs somoza by the arm whispering into his ear
somoza seems delighted with the news and turns to hub for confirmation
to claire im sorry to have to conclude this most pleasant encounter but something has happened
as somoza leaves the room with the officer and hub hub turns to claire to squeeze in one final p
did he tell you about his parents in the graveyard the flowers and all that
she nods good good
claire is left alone momentarily in somozas room
a soldier enters and accompanies her outside to the luncheon
as claire comes outside there is a flurry of activity at the head table
two officers hastily set up an easel with a large military topographical map of nicaragua
a soldier takes the microphone from the singers the music grinds to an inglorious halt and carries it to the head table
price spots claire and makes a whats all this about
claire holds out her palms and shrugs she doesnt know
all attention is quickly focused on the head table as president somoza makes a grand entrance flanked by hub kittle and an officer
he seems suddenly in unusually good spirits
hub taps the mike it works he motions for somoza to come forward
this gathering was not intended to be a press conference as much as a
but i have just been handed a piece of news
somoza plays the moment with theatrical elan
rafael is dead
beat he has been killed in an ambush in the cordillera mountains of the jinotega district
somoza points to a spot on the map as do his officer
the press table is shaken from its nonchalance and several journalists immediately leap to their feet to question him
please my friends no questions
a press release is being prepared
somoza hands the mike to an aide who returns it to the music stand
almost immediately the music begins again
at the press table there is some confusion over the announcement
some journalists hurry off to file the story others just sit
price seems alarmed by the announcement confused
slightly wired he listens to regis and other journalist discuss it
they got rafael
you believe that
every six months tacho gives this speech maybe they finally lucked out
claire tries to corner hub kittle who is heading back inside
hub disappears inside claire pressing after him
jazy approaches price and leans in as if sharing a confidence
in the b
the luncheon is breaking up
russell excuse me
but ive just been put in a rather embarrassing position
somoza would like her picture taken with miss panama
price throws his camera bag over his shoulder pulls out a camera and follows jazy
they walk toward the head table
how the hell could tacho find rafael
i have my hands full
somoza and miss panama are waiting as price and jazy arrive
price is automatically switching camera lenses but he continues to grill jazy
venga por favor
price and jazy exchange glances as somoza reluctantly joins the portrait
somoza poses with his wife and his mistress on each arm as price flashes a light meter under their noses then backs off to take the picture
is tacho lying again
they did kill him didnt they
price takes a picture somoza wants to leave and jazy would just as soon have this awkward moment over with but one more please
una mas por favor
reluctantly they pose again and price grills jazy who is trapped
we help each other right
could you move your girlfriend into the sun
jazy moves miss panama slightly returning to price
what do you need
is rafael alive or dead
i dont know
to the posers just one more thank you
to jazy i thought you knew everything
as somoza holds an interminable pose jazy launches into a speech keeping his voice low enough so tacho cannot hear
what do i know eh
tacho needs a victory very badly
he needs to prove to jimmy carter that he is still winning
he thinks rafaels death is the proof he needs
carter dont need proof
he just sent twenty five million in new arms to tacho
to posers im sorry
almost got it here
the arms shipment has been delayed in new orleans because jimmy is getting nervous
the state departments gonna pull the plug on tacho
pardon my french but whose fucking side are you on
jazy and price motion for the posers to move a step over
i work for everybody
if there is a transition of power i facilitate a relationship with the new people
if there is not i facilitate the status quo
beat either way i facilitate
i send messages to jimmy and i tell him that the revolution is a flood that cannot be stopped but it can be controlled
i cant even get a little water in my pool
rough aint it
thank you everybody very nice
price smiles to somoza mrs
somoza and miss panama
somoza hurries off from his uncomfortable position at last
i dont think rafael is dead
im gonna find him
they say hes very handsome
beat it would make a wonderful picture eh
the two men share a smile
a rental station wagon covered with press flags races along
inside the car are the british crew regis drives and price and claire
a city of about located on the side of a hill
the car pulls slowly into the base of the town into a clearing with assorted vehicles red cross la guardia press
the car moves slowly as its occupants survey the town until it pulls alongside a red cross truck that has broken down
price sticks his head out the window to ask instructions of a r
con permiso who controls what today
in spanish the sandinistas hold the hills the guardia has everything else
how do we find the guerillas
points va alli dos o tres cuartos doble la esquina al francotirador
whatd he say
go two or three blocks and turn right at the sniper
regis and his crew dont like this at all
you can drop us off
a gradual uphill grade the press car moves slowly
guardia are on both sides of the street as the car stops at the corner directly beneath the sniper tower
they all look up
were not looking for the guerillas
then let us out
the car stops the door opens and out so they climb back in quickly
a soldier holds out his arms as if to say accident
the soldier seems sincere but they dont want to take a chance
go one more block
the car moves deeper into matagalpa gradually moving among tanquettas patrolling the streets coming to a barricade which they manuever past as guardia soldiers look at them strangely
the car turns around it has come too far
a guardia officer signals for them to get out but the idea doesnt appeal to regis and he whirls around panicking slightly and heads off in the other direction
he just wanted to see credentials for crissakes whatre doing
you want to drive
we want out
the barricade officer speaks in a walkie talkie to a squadron leader a couple of blocks away as the car approaches
the second officer whistles for the car to stop but it speeds up
glass and regis panics hitting the floorboard and the car suddenly screeches around a corner racing through matagalpa
the car squeals around corner after corner blindly into out the windshield is totally destroyed now and the occupants of the car crouch low as the car races
price and claire scream at regis to stop but its too late
the car screeches into reverse as regis tries to see out the back window and price out of necessity operates the foot pedal with his hand
the car smokes into an intersection and sees an open block ahead no guardia are visible so the car races down the open block and as it comes to an
intersection several times larger than a tanquetta it dwarfs us and everything around it
its giant gun faces us head on
the press car screeches to a halt and everyone scrambles out
periodista periodista periodista
the mini cam equipment is dropped as the british crew scrambles to safety against a building
price and claire end up on opposite sides of the street
silence the huge and silent tank is deciding what to do
the turret swings several degrees to one side and lowers as the scattered journalists freeze
leaving a huge crater and not a trace of the expensive qear
claire starts laughing frightened nervous and amused
a woman throws a contact bomb from a window at the tank the tiny bomb makes a pitiful explosion hopelessly ineffective
and the wall of the house crumbles quickly as a family scrambles to the rooftop of a neighboring house
their house is destroyed in a second
la guardia troops appear and begin firing towards claire and price who turn to see sandinista army regulars running down the hill alongside the homemade local guerillas
this is the first time weve seen the f
regular army in their camouflaged khaki dress
the guard takes a position to fight it out and claire and price are caught in a cross fire pinned to walls on each street side
price pushes through a door to safety and looks back claire is trapped outside pounding on a door that doesnt open
she tries another no luck
she curls up in a doorway making herself as small as possible as bullets rip the wall around her
several youthful guerillas are pushing it
the bus comes flying down the hill toward the tank several hundred feet away it gathers speed toward us
a youth at the wheel props a board under the steering wheel and races to the back as another youth opens the door as the bus races past claire toward
the two youths leap out the back door where they tumble into the dirt just before guardia soldiers shoot the two youths before they get away as guerillas appear on
every rooftop opening heavy fire on la guardia
the sherman tank tries to dislodge itself from the bus but cannot and drags the bus with it as it backs down the hill
price runs out to claire and huddles with her
she is shaken but unhurt
sandinistas are everywhere moving into matagalpa as price and claire move past several bodies to higher ground
sandinista barricades are on every corner where women serve food to their men
claire and price wander through momentarily disoriented
a small boy runs through the street kicking a soccer ball occasionally avoiding a body
he runs right up to them and speaks
they follow him up a hill
the neighborhood is totally sandinista and several guerillas are at the door
the boy speaks to one of the guards and they are admitted
they are searched immediately asked to put down their gear asked for credentials and led down the hallway of a house that is very american middle class
another soldier with rifle detains them momentarily before showing them into a room used as a revolutionary command office
isela stands in military fatigues talking to her sandinista colleagues
clearly she commands respect and makes decisions
she finishes and turns to claire and price in a very businesslike way never acknowledging directly that they have met before
you are looking for rafael
they are somewhat taken aback at her directness and information
if its possible
do you know why were here
price doesnt do anything before announcing it first in the bar
beat its a good story
youll be more famous
an old truck chugs up a series of cutbacks through rough terrain
the truck has no hood and a boy sits on the fender pouring oil from a series of folgers cans into a funnel stuck permanently into the engine
underneath dangling cans catch the oil as it flows through
price claire and four armed sandinistas sit in the back
isela rides in front
isela claire price and the four hike into increasingly inaccessible terrain
heavily guarded but very mobile the camp consists of perhaps soldiers women preparing food several tents
price and claire attract attention as they enter
price stops and looks around the camp closely seeming to take it all in
hes been in many similar camps countries wars
price doesnt answer but continues taking it all in and isela shouts to them to continue
they continue into the camp but price stops again something has caught him his sixth sense a feeling he refuses to walk further for the moment
no glibness just coolness
what is it
price looks around speaks quietly
rafael is dead
claire looks around quickly
there is no evidence to her
i can smell it
i dont know
slightly exasperated venga por favor
they continue into the camp now claire looks around nervously
price mutters a half laugh softly and strangely as they are led to a makeshift table and offered food
in the b
isela enters one of the tents
price and claire sit down to eat and price continues scanning the camp as they talk
whatre you talking about
i know it
then why did they bring us all the way here to see him
he doesnt know
four figures conferring in front of a tent isela emerges and joins them
the others are the priest from leon and commandante cinco dressed in camouflaged khaki
isela walks over to claire and price after talking with the others
she brings commandante cinco with her
they sit down
this is commandante cinco
they all shake hands
isela begins at once
today we took matagalpa
leon is about to fall and masaya
and next week we could be in managua but it is still possible to lose
beat in the last days of our final offensive the people of nicaragua must know that rafael is alive and well
queremos un fotografia
we need a photograph
beat come with us
the tent is filled with sandinista officers and soldiers standing and sitting around
rafaels body lies on a table the shirtless upper torso propped slightly upright still wearing glasses the figure of rafael is distinctly non heroic
he is slightly overweight slightly balding but as he lies there surrounded by his men the the glow of lanterns he looks almost alive
price and claire look at each other
usted es un fotografo magnifico
beat queremos que vive
you are a great photographer
make him alive
price laughs the request is ridiculous
to claire why is he laughing
cinco steps forward his presence commands attention
his delivery is forceful but not emotional
as he begins to speak price stops laughing
in spanish we have momentum but many more lives will be lost
even washington is starting to admit that the butcher somoza is not loved by his people
they have detained twenty five million dollars in new arms shipments for somoza at an airfield in florida until they find out if rafael is alive or dead
we know about these things
he pauses briefly
if washington thinks rafael is dead they will ship the arms to somoza
do you understand
without enthusiasm commandante
soy un periodista
cinco attacks that defense with new vigor
this has nothing to do with journalism there is more to the world than journalism
we are going to end this war with you or without you
beat people dont really believe in rafael they believe in the idea of rafael no
because for now the idea of rafael is enough for the people of nicaragua
when the war is over none of this matters
price hesitates his manner devoid of its usual cockiness
i dont do things
enough lives have been lost already
beat of empathy its difficult i know but you must do it
commandante cinco places an arm on prices shoulder and speaks in broken english
in the morning eh
when theres better light
price lies on his back on a table
claire sits in a chair a lantern is on the table
his reclining body is not unlike rafaels
he plays with a camera without looking at it turning it slowly removing and replacing a lens
hes never been this calm this unmoving
claire however moves around the tent like a caged animal like price normally is
shes nervous and wired
i spend my whole life separating how i feel from how i think and what i see from what i say thats called journalism isnt it
he nods slightly
it involves distinctions
im great at distinctions
i wish i wasnt so good at them
sometimes i envy you you dont make any its very convenient
beat the only time i dont worry about all those things is when im with my daughter
or when youre in bed
beat changes direction my job is to find a story then tell a story whatever it is because i believe that if enough people hear enough stories then somehow through
information alone we all have a better chance to survive
beat i believe in information
beat thats a very romantic streak i have running through me maybe its a weakness
information is good lack of information is bad
not so simple
youre god damn right its not
beat you take that picture youll take it for all the right reasons i understand
im not gonna take it
he fiddles with the cameras
thats fine for you
but do i go back and say i interviewed rafael
do i go back and say i missed the biggest story of the war
or do i say rafael was stone cold dead thats the information isnt it
or do i say he entertained us all in his inimitably charismatic manner around the ol revolutionary campfire
beat can we throw up our arms and say we fell in love with the querillas because their cause was
beat journalists dont fall in love
beat which story do you want me to tell
do what you want to do
christ what the fuck are we doing here
i want to be here
beat with you
beat what do you want
i want this war to end
beat im not going to tell the world that rafael is dead
claire lies down on the cot
exhausted but high
price gets off the table and goes to her
i love you
i think i love you
dont think so much
he gets on the cot with her
they kiss deeply passionately and begin making love
the camp is coming to life as the flap opens on prices tent and he looks out
he raises his camera and starts taking pictures of a woman cooking over a fire as a businessman looks on a face we recognize from earlier in managua freeze frame
price rises and looks around the camp wandering over to a large can where he drinks some water
claire emerges from the tent and watches price head over to a shaded area with his cameras
their backs are toward us as he adjusts seating positions and rearranges items that have been provided for the table
he takes a light reading and moves quickly into position
price raises his camera
they sit at a table studying a map a copy of la prensa is displayed the headlines declare that rafael is dead and featuring a photo of somoza at the
luncheon as he points to a map of the country
for an instant rafael looks alive price and claire are sitting on top of a red cross truck as it heads through sebaco
soldiers from la guardia are everywhere
as the truck moves through the village something catches prices eyes oates stands against a wall in command of a squadron two whores and several troops sit against a wall
as the truck passes oates waves casually with emotion
red light in the bathroom as price pulls several photo prints from the bath and plasters them wet against the mirror
photo of rafael in the camp and he looks very much alive
he pulls more shots from the bath the priest from leon the businessman commandante cinco and isela
he dries them off and hides them with their negatives under a pile of equipment
he picks up the shot of rafael and leaves
a group of muchachos in masks baseball caps and bandanas race through the streets carrying a photo blow up of rafael
the newspaper headline sits on jazys desk as jazy studies it unemotionally
we hear miss panamas voice marcel
he spins on his chair as she glides in modeling a new dress
she spins magically for him he blows her a kiss
a small private plane flies through a canyon dwarfed by the spectacular landscape
hub kittle works the room
two masked guerillas hold a gun to the head of a pilot
a large sack is crammed into the tiny compartment with them
the plane flies in low over the town and suddenly the sky is filled with leaflets that flutter to the ground
townspeople bewildered at first pick up the papers to see local residents raise their fists in salute to the plane as it disappears into the mountains
journalists are gathered to watch the fighting which is now on the outskirts of managua
price stands to the side casually taking pictures of journalists taking pictures of the war
hub kittle floats around providing drinks and p
a push pull airplane makes bombing passes on the capitol
columns of smoke rise throughout the city
we got the smoke in frame
moves the camera slightly we got the smoke
claire stands to the other side with binoculars watching
she accepts a drink from hub and speaks into her tape deck
under a steel gray july sky
under a gray steel managuan sky
in an extraordinary development in managua president anastazio somoza has ordered the air force to begin bombing his own capitol under a sky
she fires down the drink and puts down the mike
she picks up the binoculars again and glancing below is shocked he starts into the hotel glances up and they see each other
oh my god
price sees alex at the same time
alex waves to both of as he heads into the hotel
price and claire look at each other
claire sits down at a table stunned to see alex
price commandeers a waiter and joins her with a fresh tray of drinks
a scotch please
he nods double
price joins her as other journalists jockey for position at the railing
he is equally upset and confused
whats he doing here
i have no idea
alex comes through the door with a couple journalists sees price and claire and comes over to join them
a polite kiss on claires cheek a handshake for price
a moment of awkwardness
the washington post the times networks wire services everybodys picked up the picture
nervously well yes
why are you back
i came back because of russell
because of me
the whole fucking east coast is falling in love with rafael they were sure he was dead this time
somebody wants to do a musical about him and his mugs on every t shirt in central park
alex enjoys the lunatic mixture of politics and popular culture
i think hes bigger than farrah fawcett
claire and price struggle to enjoy this supremely uncomfortable moment
its not easy to enter the game
claire attempts to change the subject
you look good
im happier in new york sure things are great
im a little slow here alex
what exactly did you come back for
no more games
alex addresses price with conviction
its a great story
beat i want to talk to rafael
and youre the only man in the world that can take me to him
prices and claires hearts sink
they look at each other
alex despite his reluctance to return to nicaragua seems genuinely enthused about the possible story
before price or claire respond hub kittle notices alex and comes over with a tray of drinks extending genuine greetings to the senior correspondent
couldnt stay away eh
the fresh round of drinks are put on the table
the sound of bombs ripping the capitol are the only thing we hear
claire and price now have adjoining rooms
she is staring out the window as he comes in
the mood is strained
weve got to tell alex what happened
ill tell him
he deserves to know
we dont owe him anything
we owe him that
beat he got you started in this business
he covered for your missed deadlines and made excuses for your unprofessional attitude before the world fell in love with your pictures
beat before kids fresh out of journalism school were rushing off to any war they could to interview bullets and take pictures of bodies like price
beat he took care of you before you were hot
shes hitting home but he doesnt want to acknowledge it
he wouldnt understand
before nicaragua you wouldnt understand
im not sure i exactly understand
beat what are we going to do
there is something calculating in prices tone this is not the fearless boyish innocent anymore
ill take alex to find rafael well go to sebaco on the road to matagalpa the guardia heavily control the area and theyre scared right now theyll never let us
we wont be able to get near rafael
alex will understand and well turn around and drive back without a story
claire is disturbed at this compounding of the lie
thats a lie
tell me about lies
they are co conspirators and they know it
i dont want to tell him either
prices white flagged newly rented press car streaks along overtaking an ox cart
a guardia convoy is going the opposite direction back toward managua
alex looks out of the car with interest he hasnt been to the front line for several wars
we may not be able to find him yknow
ive got supreme confidence in you
a car is on fire by the side of the road
price flies past alex watches curiously
several people stand around the car
claire looks good eh
everybody looks good in the tropics
alex isnt sure how to respond to this curious reply
since i havent been able to find isela since coming back youre going to have to translate for me what the hell does that mean
price is nervous wired on edge
i love her
alex takes this calmly its not exactly new information
and she thinks she loves you
its past the thinking stage
alex looks at the passing scenery hes in no hurry
id like to know something it probably doesnt matter in the great final scheme of things
but im interested
beat did you ever lay a hand on her before she left me
thats the truth
beat alex were friends
there is something desperate in his voice
price and alex are ordered out of their car by a very unfriendly guardia soldier
he is ordered to put down his camera bag
the hood and trunk are opened
they are led to a shed by the roadside a tire repair shop where they sit down in an oily dusty shack
they watch the soldiers p
the soldiers tearing up the rental car pulling off door panels looking for weapons
i bet you go through a few rental cars
i put this in your name
price and alex jerk to life at the sound of screaming in the distance
a volley of gunfire follows
price moves quickly into an adjoining shed and looks through a crack in the wall p
an execution squad in a field as several bodies are being hauled away
two soldiers reload their guns
pan to a figure moving behind a wall oates
as alex calls to him and hurries after price is single minded
as he moves through the shacks we hear another volley of fire and price bursts into a clearing to see they look at each other for several beats before anyone
oates is slightly embarrassed
no pictures eh
might look bad
oates smiles half way price looks around at the bodies
you get paid by the body or by the hour
i get paid the same way you do
what the fuck you doin in sebaco this places about to blow
you didnt have to nail pedro
alex arrives and tries to pull price back at the same time he sees the bodies and is sickened at the sight
oh my god
a body is carried through and loaded on a truck
oatess tone is one of explanation rather than defense very matter of fact
theres a motherfucking war goin on pal
lotta sad stories
price mumbles and wanders to the next truck a few feet away and as he sees it he stops short speechless
he points figures we saw at rafaels camp sit in the back of the truck
they are splattered with blood and lifeless
price is shaken
oates has to look to see who hes talking about and price loses his cool
youre a cocksucker
i dont suck no dick man
price grabs oates and pushes him backwards but oates responds like an animal
the two men go down in a heap and lash out at each other in the dust
their fighting is largely ineffective though very physical until oates asserts himself and knocks price against a wall breaking free to pick up his automatic rifle that he handles with
one hand and shoves it into prices face
id prefer not splattering your brains in a dump like this i got priorities
to alex guy wants to be a hero pops get him outta here before hes a number
beat be a shitty little town to buy it in
beat who are you
russell lets get outta here
to oates fuck you
guys got a sense of humor old man
beat got any dope
tough place to find decent dope
he leads them under an awning nearby where a couple soldiers sit
a small table some weapons two shallow boxes food beer
oates rummages around to find what he wants and pulls out a handful of photographs mostly snapshots odd sizes with names written on them
he sifts through them quickly and we see an assortment of photographs of nicaraguans
he finds what hes looking for and holds up prices photograph of the priest and the businessman the picture taken in rafaels camp blown up cropped and identified
the faces are circled
if your mug shows up in this box
and ya try to make it through sebaco
i owe yer ass
this information hits price in the gut and he is seized with fear
who gives you the pictures
whats this an interview
i aint that dumb
price turns he doesnt want to face it
off the record
off the record
some pachuco gives em to me
aint none of my business but i heard he gets em from a frog
oates pulls another picture from a different box and holds it up nice eh
alex grabs price and heads back toward the roadblock
were the ones gettin our butts kicked
price hangs a u turn at the roadblock and heads back to managua
he drives crazily
some motherfucker took my fucking pictures i dont fucking know what happened
beat fuck me
didnt you ship the film to new york
i developed it in my room
pleads jesus christ alex
the car races
compassionately it wasnt your fault if somebody stole your stuff
alex doesnt force the issue nor does he understand it entirely
what about rafael
no answer the car races back to managua
alex stares at price trying to figure out what is wrong
a maid is cleaning his room which is the usual disaster
price enters just returned and quickly looks for his negatives under the equipment where he had hidden them
algo no esta aqui
something is not here
in spanish everythings always a mess here
you should be neater
the maid shrugs price is crazy anyway and claire walks into the room she too looks shaken
he looks up
commandante cincos body was just found on the road to matagalpa
the maid starts crying
they look at her helplessly as she sobs cinco cinco
a cab takes them through the increasingly nervous city
la guardia troop trucks are everywhere things seem more hurried
a hunting rifle sits in the cabbies lap
they get out and knock on jazys door
guardia soldiers watch them from a distance a development that price and claire are aware of
i dont think its jazy
still no answer
oates said it was a frog
how many frenchmen you know around here
jazy aint facilitating shit
price is impatient
he looks around nervously the guards are out of view and he slides a knife into the latch jimmying the lock
the door opens slowly an alarm goes off
price and claire duck inside quickly
price momentarily comfortable with the danger responds quickly and finds the alarm wire running along the door jamb
la guardia troops nearby hear the alarm and head toward jazys
inside the house price finds the alarm box which he pries open and expertly pulls two wires
the alarm stops
immediately they begin going through drawers and cupboards
she pulls out some harmless snapshots of miss panama replaces them
are we looking for negs or prints
they find nothing downstairs
the look up at the sound of distant gunfire
suddenly loud banging at the front door la guardia
they look around warily hungrily they know something is wrong
back inside the house we hear the shouting soldiers banging
price and claire look at each other and the camera bag
claire points upstairs to price to the door for herself
russell grabs the bag and bounds quickly upstairs
claire goes to the front door shaking nervously
what do you want
donde esta senor jazy
no esta aqui
who are you
smiles una novia suya
a girlfriend of his
the soldiers look at each other curiously and push open the door to look in the house without entering respectful of jazy
el hombre tiene muchas novias eh
the man has many girlfriends no
the soldiers laugh and peer into the room
claire forces the door closed on them teasing slightly
no no no
afraid to make a mistake with one of jazys sweethearts they dont press the issue
the door closes shut
claire sighs with frightened relief and hurries upstairs to join price
jazys bedroom as she enters
a rumpled bed a spilled wine glass a pleasant mess
no answer russell
a door off the bedroom is open light spills out
claire stops cold at what she sees price stands in a room full of photographs hundreds of pictures of all sizes photographic equipment an enlarger cameras and lenses etc
pictures of sandino newspaper photos snapshots
of russells photographs from rafaels camp cropped and blown up commandante cinco the priest of leon the businessman isela
photographs of other slain rebel leaders
the pictures include faces that have been circled with names written in exactly as in the pictures oates possessed
they are both stunned
lets get out of here
they hurry downstairs and as they get to the front door the sound of somebody opening it
the door opens and miss panama enters she smiles and greets them in a friendly aloof manner and continues toward the waterless pool
price and claire return the greeting and continue out the door
as they emerge claire tears a white cloth in half and ties it to a stick handing half to price who does likewise
an earth mover goes past a guardia soldier at the wheel
more soldiers cling to the machine their guns at the ready
weve got to talk to alex
they start walking
you think our flags are big enough
flags held high they move nervously down the street into the ominous silence of the city
alex price and claire get out of a cab and approach a large statue of somoza on horseback surreally lit by floodlights in the center of a traffic circle
four guardia soldiers are visible on the sidewalk in the b
drinking with two women
this is what i want to show you
we drove through three roadblocks a half hour before curfew so you could show me a statue of tacho
its not tacho
tacho went to italy to commission a statue of himself he found a warehouse full of il duces on horseback got a great deal on one of em brought it
back and switched heads
beat ya cant tell can ya
alex knows price too well its a great story but thats not why theyre here
what the hell are you talking about
i think what hes trying to say what were trying to say is that things arent exactly what they seem to be
well they dont seem to be that great so i cant wait for this one
mocks silliness hey here we are
two guys in the tropics in love with the same dame
thats not why were here
i left the country because of him
points to price and i came back because of him
beat and now the cutest couple in town has me looking up a horses ass on a midnight tour of managua
points up the statues ass what are we doing here
claire addresses alex calmly
rafael is dead
alex isnt quite sure he understood
in the picture hes dead
how the hell
interrupts quickly who cares how
a bit of gallows laughter from alex as he circles the statue
price calms and tries to explain
i think i finally saw one too many bodies
beat somoza is a killer
beat i thought the war would end sooner
beat how many reasons do you want
you saw too many bodies
thats a lot of bodies
beat to price you stupid son of a bitch
to claire did he talk you into it
i wanted rafael to be alive
in some way i understand him doing it i dont like it but i understand
id do it again
alex lets it all sink in
these two people about whom he has such passionate feelings have totally exposed themselves to him
you two have of course just served me up your balls if thats what theyre called on a platter
several beats i can bury you both
youre handing me your careers
they dont respond hes right
well jesus christ
this is a motherfucking story russell
long silence what am i supposed to do with it
anything you want
small tired gallows laughter from alex
there is a long silence before alex speaks aware of the irony
theyre holding the lead in the world section for rafael
its great stuff isnt it
wed go down in a blaze of glory
distraught i dont know what to do
beat ive gotta take some kind of a story back with me
maybe jazy eh
its a little dangerous looking for jazy at the moment
mock heroic ah danger i love it
you could ask the pointy shoed little bastard about your pictures
and i could ask him whatever happened to isela
shes an officer in the rafael army we saw her in matagalpa
alex is surprised slightly but takes pleasure in revealing it
you mean i slept with a sandinista
price and claire exchange glances
alex is dead serious
i guess rafael is alive eh
price and claire lie in bed sweating
a siren and distant mortar can be heard outside
price goes to the window and shuts it the room is quieter and hotter
he pounds a broken air conditioning duct
damn air conditioning
he looks out the window it never used to be this complicated
i wish i was home
she goes to him lies down and they embrace
do you think its almost over
a loud long burst of automatic weapons fire is heard somewhere outside
their eyes are open as they hold onto each other
a sense of foreboding
heavy road equipment prowls the street looking for rebel barricades to destroy
tanquettas and guardia everywhere
the flag draped press car of price and alex drives slowly
out of the car as they look carefully things feel wrong
guardia barricades are everywhere forcing them to follow a route they might not choose
the guardia soldiers at the barricades seem on edge
when jazys house is visible in the distance barricades force them another direction
guardia soldiers race down a street toward gunfire and the car stops
when the road is clear it creeps into an intersection
they check their position
the car creeps to a stop and they look around further
everything is wrong
price looks around restlessly
lets go back
jazys probably sitting in the bar laughing at us
which ways the hotel
i dont know
ill ask her
be right back
just a sec
take a flag
but alex is out of the car at once approaching the woman
alex motions that its not necessary and talks to the woman
we cant hear but she points down the block
inside the car price cranks film into place his actions are automatic and nervous
when he looks up walking in the direction she pointed he motions to price as if to say just checking this out
price looks around nervously for a sense of direction and as he does looks through the camera
through camera p
of the dead pig followed by quick blurred pans to other images tank house woman soldier until it settles on alex in the intersection
two guardia soldiers come up to him and he holds out his hands as if to say im lost
alex talks to the soldiers freeze frame click click and the whirring sound of a motor drive another freeze frame click click more whirring price is on automatic pilot
another soldier orders alex up against a wall
nobody sees price taking pictures it happens too quickly
blank range freeze frames click click whirring as the images blur and the camera is dropped
alex lies dead as the soldiers look around the act was random almost nonchalant
price starts to run toward alex shouting madly
he stops quickly as they see him realizing how exposed he is
the guardia start firing at him realizing the murder was recorded
price leaps in his car and starts it up racing around the corner as bullets rip into the car
the window shatters and price is hit in the shoulder he clutches his bleeding arm as he races on
the car grinds to a halt and price leaps from it racing into a maze of ramshackle huts
a hastily called press conference
tacho takes a quick drag on a cigarette and makes the announcement
it is with grave concern that we announce that alexander grazier senior american correspondent has been murdered at the hands of terrorists
a shock wave goes through the room hands raised questions
kittle has prepared statements for you
somoza turns and leaves as kittle passes out press statements
tv is on
shes at the typewriter working on a story
a photograph of alex comes on the television news with spanish language commentary over the image
the story finally rising and moving in front of the television as a local newsman reads of alexs death and we see the somoza press announcement
the phone rings claire picks up the phone and listens silently before hanging up
she sits down shakily on the bed and starts crying
price hurries through the passageways between tin shacks through tiny yards of goats and chickens through houses as poor that the war has nearly passed them by
price is hurting and looks around with fear to see the guardia soldiers move down into the shantytown fanning out to quickly engulf the barrio
they move quickly
a helicopter gunship moves in low over the barrio and opens up sporadic outbursts of fire to insure nobody will try to flee
price runs down an alley and nearly runs right into the guardia
he hides behind a paper thin wall of flattened beer cans the guardia move past him only inches away
price starts off in another direction but guardia appear he is trapped in the barrio
journalists are everywhere suitcases packed trying to get out of the country
the registration desk is chaos
regis tries to get the attention of the clerk so does everyone else
get my bill and get me a cab hey amigo
the clerk is under attack
regis sees her and tries to give her comfort shes beyond that
she wears a jacket and carries her bag shes going somewhere
im sorry claire
she pushes him away politely she is single minded now
heard from russell
wanta help me find him
regis looks at her like shes crazy
its on the weird side out there
hub kittle enters the lobby sees claire and volunteers jesus christ claire a human tragedy what can i say
claire is nearly in tears but resists
fuck off hub get outta my way
claire stays in her car and watches the house no way to get close and she continues driving her route dictated by the same barricades that directed alex and price
she passes the dead pig in the street and two red cross workers make their way slowly around a corner frightened
claire gets out of her car and approaches them
in spanish do you know where the american journalist was killed
they all point down a street
she shows them the polaroid of price and her
in spanish have you seen him
they havent and continue on their way
claire walks in the direction they pointed no street fighting but many guardia
price hunches down and crawls behind the stalls as soldiers move through the yards looking for him
the woman appears in a doorway and motions with her head for price to dart inside
nothing is said
price is led into a room one of many but this room is boarded over
there is no escape
price is in pain his arm bleeds hes tiring
in spanish this is the best i can offer
he leans against the wall behind the door
he shuts his eyes a noise at the door
when he opens them she hands it to him and leaves bolting the door
price leans against the wall holding a revolver and he waits cameras around his neck gun in hand bloody slightly ridiculous and scared
prices shot up car is not far away but shes afraid to approach it
she shows the picture of price to a small boy who doesnt recognize it
guardia soldier spots claire and walks toward her
she cannot tell if the act is routine or threatening
he calls out to her
she hesitates alex is dead everything is crazy
she starts toward him then changes her mind turns and walks quickly away from him
claire runs faster and darts into a narrow passageway behind a house where she looks back
he calls for support several join him and hurry after her
panicky she runs between houses
overhead planes buzz the neighborhood as claire emerges from the maze to see p
prices car abandoned and full of holes near the shanty town
guardia are everywhere
the helicopter gunship is overhead
he hears the guard breaking in and he cocks his gun
as the squadron leader and three soldiers burst in the woman stands in the middle of the room and lies
in spanish nobody is here
the sqaudron leader points to different rooms for each soldier and they proceed to kick in each door automatic rifles ready
for a moment he doesnt see price then he whirls and faces the photographer whos so scared hes forgotten to raise his gun
price and the soldier are face to face the soldier is a fourteen year old boy fighting back tears
he too is scared to death
neither is quite sure why he is there they just want it to end
price and the boy aim their guns at each other as they hear the voice of the squadron leader in the other room
is he there
squadron leader heads toward the room but as he does the boy soldier appears in the doorway
no esta aqui
the leader grunts an order and the squadron quickly heads to the next house
prices body slumps against the wall exhausted and the woman enters as soon as the last soldier has gone
prices brief moment of peace is shattered by the screaming of guardia troops and the explosions of rocket fire from the gunship
he looks outside
the gunship fires into the shantytown killing several of its own guardia troops
a guardia officer screams at the gunship and fires a hand gun at the giant chopper
in spanish we are you
we are you
what are you doing
guardia troops evacuate the shantytown in a panicky scramble to escape their own gunship
price races through the back of the shantytown taking advantage of the chaos and without slowing down breaks free of the maze of the barrio
of price racing across the street past a body and an overturned smoking car back into the rubble strewn blocks of the edge of the city
a tanquetta comes around a corner and sees price a block away
price sees her and races along a wall until they meet grabbing her on the run each is panicky and frightened and they duck into very shallow cover barely safe
whatre you doing here
they embrace quickly and tightly but look around nervously as they do
price isnt sure if anybody knows about alex
the guardia did it i got pictures
a tanquetta passes on the next street visible through shattered holes in the buildings
a guardia squadron passes
price and claire run down the street in the opposite direction their path guided somewhat by an overturned bus in an intersection abandoned barricades and roadblocks and the rubble of
price and claire hesitate at the corner and move slowly along seeing two sandinistas dressed half in camouflaged gear half disco
the two guerrillas seem to control the street
price and claire approach warily
the guerrillas nod in spanish do you control this area
the sandinista looks at his comrade then looks around nervously frightened then shrugs
in spanish i dont know
price and claire continue on down the street and simultaneously noticed something strange the door to jazys house is wide open they approach carefully and look in a view to
the court yard
claire sticks her head in the door slowly and as she does a giant hand gun is stuck in her temple as two muchachos quickly seize her and price dragging
jazy stands with a third gun at his head being held by the most forceful and crazed of three young muchachos
with guns on jazy price and claire there is much confusion as to whos in charge and what exactly theyre doing
in spanish who are you
they are my friends
in spanish shut up
we kill them all
in spanish no
the guns are aimed back and forth in confusion price and claire dont have a chance to respond and theyre not sure what to say
in spanish him or him or her
the muchachos begin arguing rapidly among themselves and as they do jazy addresses price and claire coolly
well here we are eh
in spanish assassin
the boys are confused they think i had their family killed
you murder people
murder is a word for criminals
i have a job to protect the stability of a continent
hijo de puta
he is not begging for his life as much as for them to calm down
you got caught by some boys
poets too i imagine
beat is your recorder on
i have a speech to make
the muchachos dont understand what hes saying but they stop to listen to his style
the guns remained trained on all three
i like you people but you are sentimental shits
you fall in love with the poets the poets fall in love with the marxists the marxists fall in love with themselves
the country is destroyed with rhetoric and in the end we are stuck with tyrants
in spanish shut up
jazy turns to the boy who jams the gun into his head and speaks with tired authority
un minuto por favor
to price and claire more calmly who are you
in spanish they are journalists
the muchachos are immediately surprised and delighted and one of them speaks in excited broken english
take this picture
im going to blow his head off
the muchachos quickly withdraw their guns from price and claire and aim them all at jazys head
he is a tyrant too of course
beat but finally that is not the point you see
if we wish to survive we have a choice of tyrants and for all the right reasons your poets choose the wrong side
beat your picture of rafael was brilliant
but i am alive and better looking
a good looking frenchman with a sympathetic face is murdered in cold blood while fighting for the survival of europe and america
beat you will have another magazine cover
smiles muy complicado no
in spanish ready
you picked the wrong side
in fifty years we will know whos right
beat are you going to take the picture as the bullet enters the skull or as it comes out
this walls a nice color eh
i can move into the sunlight
claire turns and walks away her back to the scene
to claire its just a story
price remains and stares at jazy as the muchachos grow increasingly impatient
some part of him wants to take the picture
in spanish shut up
they say that if somebodys holding a gun on you you should never stop talking
thats the theory who knows
price turns and walks away toward claire
still jazy talks
maybe its a good thing that i talk too much
claire shuts her eyes
they turn to look at the fallen jazy as the three muchachos frightened by their own act race back into the street
for several moments price and claire stand frozen until the rumbling sound of a helicopter gunship nearby forces them to hurry outside
price and claire go to the doorway and look out as a jeep full of guardia screams past tanquetta a block away
the neighborhood seems to be changing hands again
price and claire slump in the darkness near the doorway she touches near his wounded arm
he nods russell
what did alex do
he asked for directions
she shakes her head and leans it against prices shoulder but the distant popping of guns does not even allow her a moment of mourning
their heads pop up nervously
we gotta get outta sight half the fucking armys looking for me
theyre not looking for me
let me have the film
beat unsure if i cant get to the hotel ill come back here
price doesnt want her to go alone but hes not that excited about hiding out in the middle of the city either
frustrated ive wrecked everything else at least let me take care of you here
its more dangerous being with you than being alone
he knows shes right
he loves her and hes made enough disastrous decisions lately
he hesitates then pops open his camera and removes the film
price ties the film into the white flag that hangs from a stick stuck into her belt
dont get hurt
affectionately thats great advice
they kiss and claire runs out after a red cross truck
price watches nervously until they turn a corner out of sight then goes back inside jazys courtyard
price nearly stumbles over jazys body stops stares hed forgotten already
the body makes him uneasy and after several moments he finds a sheet and covers jazy
price then sits down and waits nervously sharing the courtyard with jazy
claire walks alongside the red cross truck as it comes around a corner
the truck turns one direction she wants to go the other way toward the hotel
guardia troops heavily patrol the ground between claire and the hotel a jeep a troop carrier a tanquetta and fifty foot soldiers
claire takes temporary cover offered by a middle aged woman who sees that she is afraid of la guardia
claire steps behind a walled yard
moments later a boy on a bike rides slowly out of the yard and turns up the hill toward the guardia and the hotel
claires white flag is tied to his handlebars
claire watches fearfully as the boy pedals into the military zone
the woman offers claire some food she declines
the boy pedals slowly in no hurry past la guardia troops
some of them watch him curiously some ignore him
the white flag flutters as he rides
claire retraces her steps to the block where price is hiding in jazys house
the two disco sandinistas lie dead in the street a dog sniffs at the bodies
claire looks around there is little sign of life
she enters jazys house
claire enters and stops
she calls out his name no answer
price is gone
she hurries back outside
two guardia troop carriers race past sirens screaming loaded with guardia soldiers
claire steps into the street unsurely looking every direction
people begin coming out of their homes and what remains of their small homes
they come one at a time at first then in small groups carrying belongings pets chickens etc
claire shows a picture of price and her to a woman who comes out of the house next to jazys but the woman shakes her head not recognizing price
a push pull plane dives in low firing rockets at the homes
the crowd grows and chaotically flees the destruction gradually finding a direction out of the city
claire is swept along in the crowds at first without choice then finally fleeing for her life with the rest of managua
as she moves with the crowd she looks for price everywhere without success
several campfires burn near the edge of the city where dozens have taken temporary refuge
claire arrives to see a body on a stretcher being carried up outside stairs to a rooftop from which glow several bare bulbs
she goes up the stairs to the rooftop
a makeshift mobile hospital under awnings and palm fronds capable of moving location in minutes
a woman doctor and two temporary orderlies tend to wounded
a small black and white television sits on a table and those who are able watch the seige of managua on television while it goes on around them
claire looks for price among the dead or wounded
claire watches for several moments smoke flame the buzzing sound of planes swooping low fleeing crowds
she then notices the television
prices footage of alexs death comes on the tv screen and she pushes closer to see the grim sequence
the news commentator explains in spanish what we see claire is so disturbed at the images that she turns away sickened hurt guilty outraged but unable to break down
she closes her eyes her face is covered with tears
the doctor notices this and speaks softly to her
claire nods you knew the man who was killed
she nods again fifty thousand nicaraguans have died
and now one yankee
beat perhaps now americans will be outraged at what is happening here eh
it takes a while for claire to respond
perhaps they will
noise in the distance from mortars
the doctor speaks calmly without bitterness in the voice but with total conviction
maybe we should have killed an american journalist fifty years ago
claire acknowledges the grim truth of the observation with a slight nod and walks to the railing as alexs death is repeated in freeze frame sequence over and over again
as the orderlies doctor and patients gather to watch with fascination
claire stares out at the city on fire when her eye catches something a light in the sky
she watches momentarily illuminating the hospital but it continues on curiously uninterested in the guerrilla activity
the chopper sweeps above a nearby hill and hovers then slowly lowers to earth
claire watches with interest then descends the stairs
somoza watches as a back hoe digs up the coffins of his parents
an army helicopter lands lighting the scene and miss panama rushes from the chopper into his arms as the turbulence from the blades raises her dress and musses his hair
soldiers place the dirt covered caskets on the roofs of somozas two mercedes hastily tie them down and the strange motorcade flanked by two heavily armed jeeps drives off into
claire watches it all from a safe distance not far from the refugee camp
she turns and walks slowly back to the camp
claire sits down against the remains of a wall
the war has overtaken her she doesnt know if price is alive and though totally involved she is at last an observer once again
claire notices the tiny red light of her recorder is still on
she turns it off and as the sounds of battle gradually die down claire falls asleep exhausted
claire sleeps against the wall as a dog sniffs and licks her face
she awakens with a start the dog scurries away
claire rises and looks around
a local woman pushes a cart carrying the wrapped body of her husband through the otherwise quiet streets of managua
claire moves through the camp just coming to life and looks around trying to interpret the eerie silence
a woman tends to her two small children
in spanish have you seen la guardia
in spanish no
is the war over
in spanish i dont know
a distant droning noise gets steadily louder
claire looks around nervously
several tanquettas and earth movers coming over the hill in the distance
the refugees look up fearfully and some hide
as the war machinery gets closer we see that sandinistas are driving the machines draped with red and black f
blue and white nicaraguan and yellow and white the vatican flags
graffiti of victory covers the tanquettas
people come into the street cheering embracing only gradually realizing what has happened
in spanish is the war over
it is good
the woman continues with her children her comment unemotional and claire smiles slightly and walks away through a city awakening slowly to its victory
claire stops a red cross truck and shows the driver her picture of price
the picture means nothing to the driver
claire continues through the city looking for price
claire walks into the pool area where chairs and tables float in the pool the bar is overturned and the once sumptuous press oasis is a disaster
claire enters a deserted lobby also a mess and hesitates before climbing the circular stairs
claire looks into prices room and finds it empty and typically messy
looking out at the jubilant city from which smoke still rises
claire and price embrace deeply holding onto each other without the slightest intention of letting go
price and claire come downstairs to the lobby
they are cleaned up in fresh clothes they have survived and the war is over
the lobby is coming to life again with regis camera crew who look like theyve had a long night a bus boy a maid an old couple and a white
woman with two small daughters all either sit or mill in the b
price and claire stop short at what they see
a handmade casket sitting in the lobby with the name a
grazier scrawled in felt pen
price and claire stand next to the box silently there is nothing to say but the silence is interrupted by a familiar voice that is polite unforced and sincere
it was the best i would do under the circumstances
the casket i mean
awkward silence until they realize that hes sincere
can you help us ship it home
ive already taken care of it
beat i always liked the guy
i cant even get tickets for my own family but i could get you two on the plane if you want
we see the woman and little girls as hubs family
tachos in miami
a shared silence at the lunacy of the moment interrupted by the tired voice of one of hubs daughters
to price and claire i am sorry
i had a job to do thats all it put me in some unhappy situations
hub goes over to take care of his family
thousands of people have gathered to celebrate in loud and joyous singing led by a group on the highest cathedral steps surrounded by revolutionary leaders waving to the crowds
a singing group sings a song to nicaragua and a song to rafael
rafaels body in a fancy casket is carried in through the crowd to wild cheering and singing
high over the pallbearers heads it moves through the crowds
price and claire stand to the side watching it all
the celebration is joyously infectious and for the moment we can forget the bloodshed forget the problems that lay ahead forget even the death of alex
price pulls out a camera and begins taking pictures of the celebration
isela is at the microphone with other guerrilla leaders
claire works through the crowd with her mike held high recording the singing of the crowd
price backs under the awning of a stand selling refreshments and especially rum and coke mixtures known suddenly and triumphantly as nicalibres
as price snaps off pictures a voice from an american in casual street clothes drinking at the temporary bar
price looks over to see the smiling oates
its all over eh
we made it
i like the singing
whatre you doing here
now its free anyway
raises his drink nicalibre
oates holds up his kodak instamatic camera
how bout a quickie
no response no
things are heating up in thailand
thought id check it out
beat you aint gonna turn me in are ya
am i gonna see ya in thailand
we could be friends
price keeps walking into the crowd where he finds claire
oates orders another nicalibre and beats his foot to the music
weve got a plane to catch
did you get enough pictures
no answer a final complicated question from claire they smile
price waves for a cab which pulls over
they get in the cab and drive away
