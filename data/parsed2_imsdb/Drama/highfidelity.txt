de vincentis steve pink john cusack based on the novel by nick hornby london draft registered wgaw not a minisystem not a matching set but coveted audiophile clutter of mcintosh
and nakamichi each component from a different era bought piece by piece in various nanoseconds of being flush
what came first
the music or the misery
people worry about kids playing with guns and watching violent videos were scared that some sort of culture of violence is taking them over
big thin lps
fields of them
we move across them slowly
they seem to come to rest in an end of a few books
but then the cds start and go on faster and faster forever then the singles then the tapes
but nobody worries about kids listening to thousands literally thousands of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss
it seems the records tapes and cds will never end until
we come to rob always a hair out of place a face that grows on you
he sits in an oversized beanbag chair and addresses us the wall of music behind him
did i listen to pop music because i was miserable or was i miserable because i listened to pop music
group of bags huddled next to the door
not the go on vacation set but the clothes to coffee maker moving out variety
rob stares at them his face unreadable his head gripped by a big pair boudokan headphones
we hear what he is hearing something foreboding and upbeat at the same time
laura robs girlfriend enters the room and he immediately pulls the headphones off
she clocks him for a moment catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated moment of nonpresence
she begins to heft the bags rob goes to her a little tardy for his big goodbye
laura begins to cry a bit
i dont really know what im doing
he smiles and she doesnt
you dont have to go this second
you can stay until whenever
weve done the hard part now
i might as well you know
well stay for tonight then
laura shakes her head lifts the last small bag and backs out the door
a strap catches on a handle and the two of them wrestle with it a bit while trying to keep the door open until laura awkwardly disappears from view and
the door shuts behind rob
he stays right there staring at the shut door for a long moment listening to the fading sound of laura and her dragging bags
robs left hand cranks the volume knob while his right switches the cd changer to something loud and adrenal
he addresses us again
my desert island all time top five most memorable break ups in chronological order are as follows alison ashworth penny hardwick jackie allen charlie nicholson sarah kendrew
laura drags her bags banging down the stairs rob moves around the apartment seeming to expand physically looking for change as he continues
those were the ones that really hurt
can you see your name in that list laura
maybe youd sneak into the top ten but theres no place for you in the top five
those places are reserved for the kind of humiliations and heartbreaks that youre just not capable of delivering
he adjusts the angle of the tv stuffs a creepy family portrait into a drawer
that probably sounds crueler than its meant to but the fact is were too old to take each other miserable
unhappiness used to mean something
now its just a drag like a cold or having no money
he moves through the living room to an open window facing the street
looking down two stories he sees laura emerge from the building and drag her bags toward her car across the street
if you really wanted to mess me up you should have got to me earlier
rob and alison sit on the bench kissing awkwardly
which brings us to number one
the same shot the next night new clothes same clumsy make out session
my relationship with alison ashworth lasted six hours
the two hours after school and before the rockford files three days in a row
on the fourth afternoon
and the fourth night
alison and another boy kevin bannister
in the background rob approaches and stops
he implodes with self consciousness and humiliation and attempts to affect a casual gait as he mopes away
it would be nice to think that since i was fourteen times have changed relationships have become more sophisticated females less cruel skins thicker but there still seems to be
an element of that afternoon in everything that has happened to me since
all my other romantic stories seem to be a scrambled version of that first one
rob sits in his chair a cord leading from the stereo to headphones draped around his neck
behind him is the wall of music
penny was great looking and her top five recording artists were carly simon carole king james taylor cat stevens and elton john
he lets the needle down on the turntable next to him
nobody does it better by carly simon begins to play as and continues as soundtrack
penny is walking across the grass toward us
shes the clean sporty nice wholesome girl next door
she waves to off camera friends smiling a winning smile
everybody liked her
she was nice
penny and rob sit on the edge of the bed kissing
rob moves his hand up toward the breast but the hand then seems to have a new idea and dives south to follow the thigh into pennys skirt
she was so nice in fact that she wouldnt let me put my hand underneath or even on top of her bra
when he contacts skin penny rolls like a gymnast away and off of the bed out of frame
rob looks away balefully
nobody does it better continues as rob walks penny to her front door
she is smiling he seems distant
penny was nice but i wasnt interested in nice just breasts and therefore she was no good to me
and so i was finished with her
she leans in to kiss him and he shrugs her off
whats the point
it never goes anywhere
without looking at her rob turns and walks down the street getting smaller
penny watches for a while
rob sways with the other commuters
she cried and i hated her for it because she made me feel bad
i started dating a girl who everybody said would put out and penny went with this asshole chris thompson who told me that he had sex with her after something
like three dates
how had penny gone from a girl who wouldnt do anything to a girl who would do everything
a businessman looks up from his paper at rob then back down
an old chicago block of local merchants on a busy street
rob makes his way down the street jangling a set of keys and talking to us
my stores right up here
its called the record exchange
its carefully placed to attract the bare minimum of window shoppers
rob arrives at a storefront and begins unlocking a rusty gate with two locks and then a beaten down door
i get by because of the people who make a special effort to shop here on saturday young men always young men who spend a disproportionate amount of their time
looking for deleted smiths singles and original not rereleased underline frank zappa albums
in almost darkness
more light might penetrate the windows if there werent so many record release posters taped to them
a dusty narrow corridor clad in burlap and shag rug
on the walls are bagged s you will never hear unless you commit your life to the losing proposition of listening to every noodling of jah wobble and glen glenn
and other people youve never heard of
but as rob opens the door enters and flips a switch causing the fluorescents to sputter we see in his eyes the reverence and earnestness of a football coach gazing
across an empty field or a priest drawn at midnight to his empty church
the fetish properties are not unlike porn
i would feel guilty taking their money if i wasnt kind of well one of them
as he walks one of the two slim aisles toward the back he stops on a dime steps back and pulls a cd from the sea and replaces it almost
the same position but not quite meticulousness and pride in this gesture
after a moment the door creaks open behind rob admitting dick a nervous forlorn but sweet and intelligent discophile with long greasy black hair a sonic youth t shirt a
monstrous pair of headphones and a canvas record bag emblazoned with a label logo
i found the first licorice comfits album at vintage vinyl
the one on testament of youth
never released here
japanese import only
ill tape it for you
no thats okay
cause you like their second one you said pop girls
the one with cheryl ladd on the cover
you didnt see the cover though
yeah i havent really absorbed that one
well ill just make it for you
dick is behind the counter rob in the aisles with a clipboard doing inventory
re music whats this
the new belle and sebastian
the door flies open and barry an acid tongued post punk rock misanthrope without quite enough intelligence to conceptualize his own rebellion walks in
his teeth are clenched in air guitar concentration and hes phonetically cranking a clash riff dick shrinks back from him instinctively
he stops mid step and cocks his ear at the music playing in the store
his face adopts an exaggerated grimace
what the fucks this
its the new its the record weve been listening to and enjoying barry
barry moves in on the stereo behind the counter and dick gets out of his way
well thats problematic because it sucks ass
he pops the cd out and frisbees it to dick
re the cd yours i assume
barry pulls a tape out of his jacket and jams it in
how to kill a radio consultant by public enemy comes through at through the red levels
over the blare barry walks in rhythm toward the stockroom and disappears
rob goes behind the counter and stops the tape
barrys head pops out of the stockroom
what are you doing
i dont want to hear public enemy right now
all im trying to do is cheer us up
go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if i care
i dont want old sad bastard music either
i just want something i can ignore
but its my new tape
my monday morning tape
i made it last night just for today
yeah well its fucking monday afternoon
you should get out of bed earlier
dont you want to hear whats next
sighs little latin lupe lu
mitch ryder and the detroit wheels
the righteous brothers
barry bristles and moves slowly in on dick
no not nothing
whats wrong with the righteous brothers
i just prefer the other one
how can it be bullshit to state a preference
since when did this shop become a fascist regime
since you brought that bullshit tape in
thats the fun of working in a record store
playing crappy pap you dont want to listen to
i thought this tape was going to be you know a conversation stimulator
i was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a monday morning and all that and you just had to ruin it
well do it next monday
well whats the point in that
hear the sound of skateboard wheels clacking and scraping getting louder
rob dick and barry stop fighting to listen then each moves purposefully to a spot in the store
dick to the register barry to the back rob next to the door as if bracing for a street fight
the sound gets closer then stops
the door swings open to admit vince and justin two fifteen year old skate punks
vinces hair is post apocolyptically hacked to different lengths justins in uniformly shaven with leopard spots dyed browse
rob follows them watching their every move
dick counters from his perch getting another angle
barry cracks his knuckles threateningly
vince and justin do their best browser impersonations
finally justin plucks a cd and the two move to the counter
didnt you steal that one already
can i help you
thatll be fifteen twenty seven
vince reaches into his deep pocket and pulls out a paper cup with piece of paper attached that says please help me
he pours a mass of change and crumpled singles onto the counter
dick begins counting it out
isnt your name dick
dick cracks a sad smile for a second
he bags the cd and vince and justin are off
rob walks back through the stock room door
rob is on his knees opening boxes with a razor knife
he talks to us as he works
im sick of the sight of this place to be honest
some days im afraid dick sticks his head in the door looks at rob looks where rob is looking camera and retreats back through the door
im afraid ill go berserk rip the elvis costello mobile from the ceiling throw the country artists male a k rack out onto the streets go off to work in
a virgin megastore and never come back he hears the bell on the front door ring and he stops and listens looks a bit worried
im looking for a record for my daughter
for her birthday
i just called to say i love you
do you have it
we got it
rob relaxes and goes back to work
can i have it then
no you cant
rob deflates shaking his head
barry leans back elbows up on the counter behind him talking to the customer a middle aged graying man in a raincoat
because its sentimental tacky crap thats why not
do we look like the kind of store that sells i just called to say i loved you
go to the mall and stop wasting our time
whats your problem
what did i
why are you do you even know your daughter
there is no way she likes that song
or is she in a coma
the customer throws up his hands and starts out of the store
okay okay buddy
i didnt know it was pick on the middle aged square guy day
ill be on my way
he steps out of the door
outside anger catches up to the customer
he turns and throws up a middle finger and bolts
barry smiles and turns to see standing in the doorway of the stock room
he feigns applause
top five musical crimes perpetrated by stevie wonder in the s and s
subquestion is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins
is it better to burn out than to fade away
you just drove a fucking customer away barry
we didnt even really have it
i happen to know for a fact that the only stevie wonder single we have is dont drive drunk
i was just goofing on the straight and it never cost you a penny
not the point
oh so whats the point then
i dont want you talking to our customers like that again
you think that mr
bean out there is going to be a regular
robs face begins to redden with anger
barry im fucking broke
i know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didnt like but its gotta stop
the guy was going to buy one record which we didnt even have and leave and never come back again anyway
why not have a little fun
big fucking deal
what did he ever do to you
he offended me with his terrible taste
it wasnt even his terrible taste
it was his daughters
oh now youre defending that motherfucker
youre going soft in your old age rob
there was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street
now all of a sudden im offending your golf buddy
sarcastic youre right rob
i am so sorry
how are we ever going to make enough money to get you and laura into the country club
rob is red and seething
and by the way i tell you this for your own good thats the worst sweater ive ever seen
i have never seen a sweater that bad worn by anyone im on speaking terms with
its a disgrace to the human race
rob springs on barry grabbing him by the lapels and jerking him up against the wall
rob is so mad he cant say anything
rob runs out of steam and drops barry who backpedals fast
extremely shaken what are you some kind of fucking maniac
if this jackets torn youre gonna pay big
barry stomps out of the store
rob turns and goes back to the stockroom and sits on the stepladder
dick appears in the doorway terrified
are you all right
look dick laura and i broke up
and if we ever see barry again maybe you can tell him that
course i will rob
no problem at all
ill tell him next time i see him
dick sets out into the uncharted conversational territory of interpersonal relationships
got some other stuff to tell him anyway so its no problem
ill just tell him about you know laura when i tell him the other stuff
ill start with your news before i tell him mine obviously
mine isnt much really just about marie lasalle flashes cd of pretty woman playing at lounge ax tonight
i like her you know shes kind of sheryl crowish
but you know good
so ill tell him before that
good news and bad news kind of thing
dick laughs nervously
or rather bad news and good news because he likes this person playing tonight
i mean he liked laura too i didnt mean that
and he likes you
its just that i understand dick
do you want to
talk about it that kind of thing
rob looks up at dick who is so nervous that his brow is wet
thanks though dick
dick sighs with relief and smiles his way out of the stock room
rob to camera
number three in the top five break ups was charlie nicholson sophomore year of college
some people never got over nam or the night their band opened for nirvana
i guess i never really got over charlie
about twenty feet away we see a tall thin beauty bleach blonde hair cropped short in darling s new wave asymmetry
she is speaking animatedly to a pamphleteer driving her points home with a forefinger
she looked different
she talked a lot about remarkably interesting things like music books film and politics
a younger rob sits amongst a group of students who are engaged in a heated conversation
he is smiling mouth closed just happy to be there
charlie sitting next to him tousles his hair as she talks incessantly
over her talking so we didnt have those terrible strained sentences that seemed to characterized most of my relationships
and she liked me
she liked me
she liked me
charlie gives rob a quick kiss and keeps talking
rob and charlie walk arm in arm rob in cool clothes and sunglasses trying to look cool charlie making a point about something
rob checks out how cool he looks with her as they walk by a store window reflection
we went out for two years and for every single minute i felt as though i was standing on a dangerously narrow ledge
i couldnt get comfortable couldnt ever stretch out and relax
why would a girl no a woman like charlie go out with someone who only a few years ago sewed a foghat patch on his jacket
i felt like all those people who suddenly shaved their heads and said theyd always been punks
i felt like a fraud
and i was depressed by the lack of flamboyance in my wardrobe
the fabulous sophomore design students studio apartment white wood floor white walls overvarnished door doisneaux print on the wall futon on the floor
rob lies back on his elbows watching charlie in uncomfortable worried awe
she stands her back to him wearing only her underwear and pulling on a t shirt a heartbreaking image to look back on
i worried about my abilities as a lover
i was intimidated by the other men in her design department and became convinced that she was going to leave me for one of them
charlie turns around and looks at rob with naked ambivalence
she left me for one of them
the dreaded marco
it is raining like crazy and rob is shouting up at a lit window maniacally gesturing
the curtains part and charlies figure appears clad only in a sheet
next to her is a tall built handsome man marco also in a sheet
eventually he falls to his knees with a splash and buries his head in his hands
the light goes out
and i lost it
i lost it all
dignity faith fifteen pounds
rob wandering through the rain
any small idea of personal identity that i had acquired up to that point
a younger and catatonic rob listlessly sorts through a stack of records
i came to three months later and to my surprise had flunked out of school and started working in a record store
rob stands in front of his wall of music shifting lps around between the shelves and piles on the floor as he talks to us
what i really learned from the charlie debacle is that you gotta punch your weight
charlie was out of my class too pretty too smart too witty too much
what am i
not the smartest guy in the world but certainly not the dumbest
ive read books like the unbearable lightness of being angelas ashes and love in the time of cholera and understood them i think theyre about girls right
just kidding but i dont like them very much
my all time top five favorite books are johnny cashs autobiography snow crash by neil stevenson zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance the trouser press guides to rock and
i dont know probably something by kurt vonnegut
i look through the new yorker when my neighbors done with it and im not averse to going down to the fine arts to watch subtitles films although on the
whole i prefer american films
top five being blade runner cool hand luke the first two godfathers which well count as one taxi driver and the shining
im okay looking average height not skinny not fat
my genius if i can call it that is to combine a whole load of averageness into one compact frame
you might say there were millions like me but there arent really alot of guys have impeccable music taste but dont read alot of guys read but are really fat
alot of guys are sympathetic to women but have stupid beards alot of guys have a woody allen sense of humor but look like woody allen
some drink too much some drive like assholes some get into fights or show off money or do drugs
i dont do any of these things really
if i do okay with women its not because of the virtues i have but because of the ugly flaws i dont have
charlie and i didnt match
after her i was determined to never get out of my league again
rob presses play on the answering machine
a pleasant older female voice is heard
its janet lauras mother
on machine hello you two
laura its your mother
your fathers angina is a little rough today and i thought hed like to talk to you
no big deal
i love you two
on machine rob its liz
just calling to see well if youre okay
give me a ring
im not taking sides
lots of love
he pulls an lp from a shelf puts it on the turntable and sits back in his chair
the music becomes soundtrack to the following scenes
rob and sarah a thin modestly attractive young woman sarah walk and talk
they seem to be emphatically complaining together
charlie and i didnt match
marco and charlie matched
me and sarah number four on the all time break ups list matched
she wore more or less the same clothes as mine had an acceptable working knowledge of music and she had been dumped by some asshole named michael
he was her moment charlie was mine
sarah had sworn off men
i had sworn off women
it made sense to pool our loathing of the opposite sex swear them off together and get to share a bed with someone at the same time
rob and sarah sit up in bed staring at the television
we were frightened of being left alone for the rest of our lives
only people of a certain disposition are frightened of being alone for the rest of their lives at twenty six
we were of that disposition
everything seemed much later than it was
of sarah sitting across the table mid confession
when she told me that she met someone else it made no sense
her meeting someone else was contrary to the whole spirit of our arrangement
all we really had in common was that we were dumped by people and that we were against dumping
we were violently anti dump
so how come i got dumped
the music becomes presence again and rob takes the needle off the record
you run the risk of losing anyone who is worth spending time with
but i didnt know that at the time
all i saw was that id moved down a division and that it still hadnt worked out and this seemed cause for a great deal of misery and self pity
and thats when laura came along
rob is surrounded by stacks of records on the floor
he looks to camera
im reorganizing my records tonight
its something i do in times of emotional distress
when laura was here i had them in alphabetical order before that chronologically
tonight though im trying to put them in the order in which i bought them
that way i can write my own autobiography without picking up a pen
pull them all off the shelves look for revolver and go from there
ill be able to see how i got from deep purple to the soft boys in twenty five moves
what i really like about my new system is that it makes me more complicated than i am
to find anything you have to be me or at the very least a doctor in rob ology
if you wanna find landslide by fleetwood mac you have to know that i bought it for someone in the fall of and then didnt give it to them for
but you dont know any of that do you
you would have to ask me to the phone rings again
rob picks it up
its your mother
rob deflates a bit
everything all right
hows the store
up and down
your lucky lauras doing so well
if it wasnt for her i dont think either of us would ever sleep
rob holds his lips together with thumb and forefinger but succumbs she left
what do you mean
where did she go
how would i know
not say where gone
laura move out
well call her mother
she just called
she doesnt even know
its probably the last time ill ever hear her voice
thats weird isnt it
you spend christmas at somebodys house you know and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe and
therell be another mom and another christmas
im all right if thats whats upsetting you
you know thats not whats upsetting me
well it fucking should be shouldnt it
i knew this would happen
what are you going to do rob
im going to drink this bottle of wine watch tv and go to bed
then tomorrow ill get up and go to work
and after that
meet a nice girl and have children
i promise the next time we talk ill have it all sorted out
i knew this was going to happen
then what are you getting so upset about
what did laura say
do you know why she left
its got nothing to do with marriage if thats what youre getting at
so you say
id like to hear her side of it
for the last fucking time im telling you laura didnt want to get married
she is not that kind of girl
to use a phrase
thats not what happens now
well i dont know what happens now apart from you meet someone you move in she goes
you meet someone you move in she goes
shut up mom
rob hangs up the phone
he fills up his glass again takes a swig and slumps into a chair
if there was any wind left in rob it just got knocked out
after a moment he gets to his feet grabs his jacket and heads out the door
rob comes down the street and gets in the short line to enter the club
from inside he hears a guitar playing a tune that becomes familiar not only to rob but to us
when a strong lilting female voice begins to sing we hear what it is baby i love your way by peter frampton
rob smiles at first but begins to darken as the verse continues
he steps out of line and leans against the outside wall listening
is he beginning to cry
yes he is
show me the way
a phenomenon based on a live album that was actually recorded in a studio
what is happening
i am getting misty choked up at a song that i had the good sense at twelve to realize was so saccharine and stupid as to be inarticulatable until michael
bolton that is
he looks around self consciously and paces a bit deciding whether or not to stay
he takes a deep breath and heads in the door
as rob enters he looks to the stage where marie lasalle is standing alone with her acoustic guitar heading toward the songs finish
robs expression begins to shift from the melancholy to something else altogether
marie is beautiful and marie has touched his heart
rob navigates toward her though the small crowd as if pulled by something unseen
he addresses us over his shoulder
sentimental music makes you nostalgic and hopeful at the same time
maries the hopeful part
lauras the nostalgia part
these things happen
they happen to men at any rate
this is why i shouldnt be listening to pop music
as he gets closer to the stage rob looks over to see dick sitting with barry a few feet away
he shakes it off and sits with them extending a meaningful hand to barry who takes it
they turn back to the stage as marie finishes the song
i always hated this song
but now i kind of like it
dick and barry nod then keep watching
all three of them are in their own private fantasies with marie
she shouldnt done it on the number four with a smile
isnt her album called number four with a smile
thats what i said
no no no you said the number four with a smile and theres no the at the front of the title of the album
its a reference to a chinese meal in toronto and i think that there is a the
but i could be wrong
you can be and are wrong
they drop it so that their eyes can drift back to marie
i wanna date a musician
nods in agreement i wanna live with a musician
shed write songs at home ask me what she thought of them maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes
maybe a picture of me in the liner notes
just in the background somewhere
as the song ends and she smiles out over the room
the audience applauds
thanks you guys i know im not supposed to like that song but i do
im gonna take a break for a second
anybody wants to buy one of my tapes theyre five bucks up here
one of my other personalities will be selling them
lets go get one
i want a tape
barry and dick stand and begin to move off
i dont need to go up there right now
and theyre gone
after a beat rob gets up and follows them
dick and barry wait nervously to buy a tape rob just behind them
marie processes sales with polite monosyllables until the three get up front
they dart eyes to each other then nod
cause im enjoying myself
rob hands her a ten and she roots around in a duffel bag for change
so you live in chicago now
not far from here actually
you like it
you guys might be the sort to know
are there any good record stores around here or do i have to go downtown
barry and dick do not try to control themselves
they point to rob
hes got one
on clark street
a couple blocks
we work there
youd love it
what do you sell
a little of anything that matters
rock soul r b punk rock hip hop ska new wave
the line behind them is moving in and marie smiles at them and turns to someone else
they scurry back toward their table
what did you tell her about the shop for
i didnt know it was classified information
i mean i know we dont have any customers but i thought that was a bad thing not like a business strategy
rob looks over barry at marie
she catches his eye as she looks over the room
his eyes shoot to the floor
rob is going through a huge stack of used cds sorting them off into different bins bouncing his head absently to the music the same song of maries that rob
had on when laura called last night
rob reaches over and hits the speaker button on the phone still in the groove of sorting
you called this morning
i just wanted to thank you for that message last night
it made me feel like
like less of an asshole
howre you holding up
actually im fine
last night i got to thinking you know what
maybe it is time to move on
maybe were just not right for each other
or maybe we are
but time will tell and at this point im going to be fine with whatevers meant to be
like i said i dont want to take sides
and i like laura with you
shes more fun more open
you guys are good together
i just wish you two could i dont know
i dont think much of this ian guy dick bursts in huge faced rob
liz hold on a second turns to dick what
marie lasalle is in the store
here shes here and now
rob freezes he and dick turn to the speaker which cranks maries voice
rob goes to the phone and picks up the handset
liz can you hold for a second
he hits hold
to dick ill be out there
picks up the phone hey liz i gotta go
he hangs up fast spins around to look in a cracked one foot square cracked mirror bearing the logo of aerosmith that is mounted on the wall and moves out
into the and up the aisle fast toward the stereo where he turns maries music off
he takes a deep breath and looks up meeting her eyes
re music dont you like that
no no i love its just thinking youre you must be so sick of it
he reaches back and puts it back on
he cracks his face into a smile then walks fast back to the stock room door
marie watches him go
where as soon as he crosses the threshold his fist clench and he grimaces dick comes in rob
dick backs out fast
rob leans on a wall
barry enters were only on the fucking list for maries gig at the pulaski pub thats all
all three of us
thats fucking great barry
we can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each
we can take your car
its not my car now is it
its lauras car and thus laura has it
so its an ass bumping double transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab
barry sighs throws up his hands and heads out the door
rob seems to be having trouble staying on his feet
who the fuck is ian
rob enters and walks to the mail table looking like shit
he starts sifting through envelopes for his
laura doesnt know anybody called ian
theres no ian at her office
she has no friends named ian
she has never met anyone called ian in her whole life
although there may have been one in college but i am almost certain that since she has lived in an ian less universe
his face gets a little paler as he lifts a letter up to his face
a cable service bill to a mr
as he looks at it divining
rob to camera
ray to his friends and more importantly to his neighbors
the guy who up until about six weeks ago lived upstairs
i knew it was him the moment i saw the letter
i start to remember things now his stupid clothing his music latin bulgarian whatever fucking world music was trendy that week stupid laugh awful cooking smells
i cant remember anything good about him at all
i never liked him much then and i fucking hate him now
i manage to block out the worst most painful most disturbing memory of him until i go to bed
we move silently through the rooms and enter the bedroom
closer to the bed we see rob on his back sheets held clenched up to his chin
he stares at the ceiling sadly
to almost the same shot but its rob and laura in the bed semi tangled
laura has a book in her lap
a creaking is heard
lauras eyes go to the ceiling and rob sits up at attention
they look up at the light fixture which shakes a little faster with the rhythm of the creaking
someone is definitely having sex upstairs and they are going for it
he goes on long enough
i should be so lucky
they turn to each other and laugh
to rob lying still in bed staring at the ceiling
you are as abandoned and as noisy as any character in a porn film laura
you are ians plaything responding to his touch with shrieks of orgasmic delight
no woman in the history of the world is having better sex than the sex you are having with ian in my head
ian mercilessly savages laura from behind below and above champagne showers toe sucking and animal screams imploding with disgust and sorrow
tears run down his cheeks into his ears
number five jackie allen
my break up with jackie allen had no effect on my life whatsoever
i just slotted her in to bump you out of position laura
yes you do in fact make it into the top five
and just to remind you the list is in chronological order not in the order of pain and suffering
dick and barry are stocking the racks
rob stands at the register rocking back and forth sort of like an idiot to always and forever by the commodores
he is a mess
rob looks up to see a nineteen or twenty year old girl standing in front of him
do you have soul
rob smiles bitterly at her clearly having a different meaning in mind
that all depends
she kind of backs away and goes back to browsing
the phone rings and rob picks it up
how many records
right well if you could bring them okay well where do you live
how about now
i can come right over
rob scribbles okay
he hangs up and grabs his jacket
dick emerges from the back
to dick some ladys got some singles to sell
ill be back in a half hour
rob walks out
rob mounts the stairs and rings the doorbell
the door opens revealing a too tan woman in her late forties in designer jeans and a t shirt bearing a rhinestone peace sign
she says nothing
you called about the records
she turns and walks into the house leaving the door open for him
he follows her in and through a fabulous first floor packed with big bucks bourgeois rugs art and antiques she ushers rob into a large study and turns the light
he misses a breath
the walls are lined with mahogany cases custom built for cds albums epicurean stereo components a couple priceless vintage guitars every one of the thousands of items bear a little
numbered sticker like a museum
she points to several boxes on the floor full of hundreds of singles
rob steps into the room like an undeserving and carefully drops to his knees to examine the singles each pristine in a plastic sleeve the original god save the queen
by the sex pistols original otis reddings elvis presleys james browns jerry lee lewises beatles
on and on
the mother lode
rob is doing the best to control the onset of hyperventilation
he dares a glance over his shoulder to her to see if this is a joke
what do you think
its the best collection ive ever seen
give me fifty bucks and theyre all yours
robs face goes funny
he looks around for a hidden camera
these are worth at least i dont know i know what theyre worth
give me fifty and get them out
but you must have i must have nothing
their my husbands
and you must not be getting along too well right now huh
hes in jamaica with a twenty three year old
a friend of my daughters
he had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and i told him to fuck off so he asked me to sell his singles
collection and send him a check for whatever i go minus a ten percent commission
which reminds me
can you make sure you give me a five
i want to frame it and put it on the wall
it must have taken him a long time to get them together
this collection is as close as hes ever come to an achievement
rob looks back at the records but avoids the trance
can i pay you properly
you dont have to tell him what you got
send him forty five bucks and blow the rest
give it to charity
that wasnt part of the deal
i want to be poisonous but fair
looking back at the records look
i dont want to be any part of this
there are plenty of others who will
thats why im trying to compromise
what about fifteen hundred
theyre worth five times that
thats my lowest offer
and i wont take a penny over ninety
they start smiling at each other
with eleven hundred he could come home and thats the last thing i want
im sorry but i think you better talk to someone else
rob half stands then drops again for one last lingering look
can i buy this otis redding single off you
oh come on
let me give you ten dollars for this and you can give the rest away for all i care
because you took the trouble to come up here
and because youve got principles
but thats it
im not selling them to you one by one
rob comes down the stairs holding his single and walks down the street talking to camera
how come i end up siding with the bad guy the man who ran off to jamaica with some nymphette
i just got left for someone else so why cant i bring myself to feel whatever it is his wife is feeling
all i can see is that guys face when he gets that pathetic check in the mail for those records and i cant help but feel desperately painfully sorry for
the bar where al capone used to party and it looks about the same colored lightbulbs shadowboxes deep plush booths and a stage for jazz
rob slumps back in a booth stirring a drink with his finger
after a beat we hear a door slam off camera and rob looks up with a bit of fear
heavy footsteps get louder and closer until a shadow shrouds rob liz stands in front of him
she is enormous and she is mad as hell
rob reflexively shrinks
whats the hey liz no no no dont even
i talked to laura rob
i talked to her and she gave me a little background
and youre a fucking asshole
she turns and stomps toward the door
rob gets up and follows
rob comes out of the club and follows liz
she hears him and turns on him punctuating with a finger in his chest
to think i sympathized with you for two seconds
laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs
you let me believe that
two years ago you got laura pregnant you then proceeded to cheat on her
you borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back
and then just a few weeks ago you told her you were unhappy with her and were kind of looking around for somebody else
well she she turns again and keeps walking holding a defiant middle finger over her shoulder as she fades down the street
rob sits rocking slightly with the movement of the train
he stares at an old couple who do not speak to each other
shes right of course
i am a fucking asshole
i did and said those things
but before you judge although youve probably already done so go off for a minute and write down the top five worst things that you have done to your partner
even if especially if your partner doesnt know about them
dont dress things up or try to explain them
just write them down in the plainest language possible
a long beat even five or ten seconds
okay so whos the asshole now
for the first time we see the place kind of busy
rob watches the room
barry is toward the back talking to a customer
cruel to be kind by nick lowe plays
its almost impossible to find especially on cd
yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables
but every other echo and the bunnymen album i have all of the others
well what about the first jesus and mary chain
they always seemed
they always seemed what
they always seemed really great is what they always seemed
they picked up where your precious echo left off and youre sitting here complaining about no more echo albums
i cant believe that you dont own that record
he plucks it from the rack and sticks it in the customers hand who regards it with a bit a of shame
well what about the new echo do not get ahead of yourself
is listening to a female customer but he doesnt hear her voice
the army bag with a red cross on it
the ring of ivy tattoo around the wrist
the monkey boots
the eye shadow
the interesting thing about green day is that so much of their music is in truth directly influenced by in my opinion two bands
but also the stranglers
i think you would love the stranglers
dick pulls a stranglers record and puts it on the stereo
her brow furrows and then she smiles
this sounds great
dick smiles humbly
two people in the store turn and approach
is this the new green day
barry still talking to his customer who now has several cds in his hand
he looks at barry with a mixture of hate and adoration
that is perverse
do not tell anyone you dont own fucking blonde on blonde
what about television
i have a television
barry adds more records to the customers stack
stand behind the counter
rob holds a cd in his hand and surveys the roaming customers with a semi serious air of authority
i will now sell four copies of cats and dogs by the royal trux
rob pops the cd in and it begins to play
he stands there with his arms folded waiting
after a moment a customer approaches
re music what is this
its the royal trux
of the room
something has caught his eye a cropped head with a leopard skin pattern surfaces and disappears like nessie
robs face gets hot and mad
he jumps out from behind the counter
dick ring the man up
he moves like a cat through the crowd
justin sees him coming and counters around the middle island and heads for the door
vince appears next to him fiddling with his belt
he sees rob now and he and justin bolt for the door
rob doubles back
dick sees vince and justin too late
rob is right behind them and as they get out the door he reaches
and comes up with the back half of a skateboard
rob emerges behind them vinces skateboard in hand
they have enough distance to bolt but they cant leave that board behind
how much is this deck worth to you and how many cds did you rip off
can you do the math
justin pulls two cds out and slides them over to rob
to vince and what about you dork
vince pulls about six and puts them down in a neutral spot
rob picks all of them up and starts looking through them
dicks pokes his head out of the door
dick call the police please
vince and justin look at each other
looking through the cds eno import
sigue sigue sputnik
ryuchi sakamoto syd barrett
whats going on here
are you guys stealing for other people now
those are for us
you two are slamming to nico now
youre like so bigoted to look at us and like think you know what we listen to
you got the cds so can i have my board back
i think you have more
well we dont
i cant frisk you but the cops can
justin reaches down again into his baggy shorts and comes up with a tattered old book how to make a record
he tosses it over
that things been in the bargain bin for six months
was it just your criminal nature or what
hell i wouldve given it to you for free
we dont know how it works
nobody even knows so we wanted to check it out in that mag
like do you know how to actually make a cd
rob cant resist edifying them the curse of the underappreciated expert
uh yes i like do
you make the tracks recording studio deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut the master is then dubbed to submasters which are the mothers as their
called for each press in the plant
you press the cds or records put in your cover art and thats it
records are those big round black things right
rob turns to go back in the store
hey can i have my board
rob drops it and enters the store
barry emerges from the back with three opened bottles of beer as the last customer goes out the door
the three lean against the bins tired and smiling
to rob what
what do you mean what
what are you snickering about
im not snickering
because im happy
what am i missing
what do you have to be happy about
well we rang today
yeah but more than that
im happy because im proud of us
because although our talents are small and peculiar we use them to their best advantage
dick and barry look at each other
they almost know how to take a compliment
rob now alone turns the sign from open to closed shuts the door behind him and pulls the gate across
laura appears from the next doorway
i thought i could give you a lift back
are you coming home
well im coming over to your house to get some things
laura turns and begins walking
rob looks at camera
first of all the money
the money is easy to explain she had it and i didnt and she wanted to give it to me
if she hadnt i would have gone under
ive never paid her back because ive never been able to and just because shes took off and moved in with some supertramp fan doesnt make me five grand richer
so thats the money lauras car horn is heard
he heads off
they move down the street and its a little tense
laura pushes a tape into the stereo
art garfunkels bright eyes begins to play
rob turns away from her and makes a face but she knows hes making it
you can make all the faces you want
my car stereo
my compilation tape
rob tries not to speak but how can you like art garfunkel and marvin gaye
its like saying you support the israelis and the palestinians
its not like saying that at all actually rob
art garfunkel and marvin gaye make pop records made
marvin gaye is dead his father shot him in whatever and the israelis and the palestinians dont
art garfunkel and marvin gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute and the israelis and the palestinians are
art garfunkel and marvin gaye alright alright but and who says i like marvin gaye anyway
he reels on her
got to give it up
thats our song
marvin gaye is responsible for our entire relationship
is that right
id like a word with him
but dont you remember
i remember the song
i just couldnt remember who sang it
rob shakes his head in disbelief
i can see why you prefer gaye to garfunkel
i get it really
but there are so many other things to worry about
theyre only records and if one is better than the other well who cares besides you and barry and dick
i mean really who gives a flying fuck
you used to care more about things like marvin gaye than you do now
when i first met you and i made you that tape you loved it
you said and i quote it was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection
well i liked you
you were a deejay and i thought you were hot and i didnt have a boyfriend and i wanted one
so you werent interested in music at all
more so then than i am now
thats life though isnt it
the car slows and laura parks
thats all there is to me
there isnt anything else
if youve lost interest in that youve lost interest in everything
you really believe that
laura turns the engine off and unbuckles her seat belt
look at me
look at our the apartment
what else do i have other than records and cds
and do you like it that way
she half smiles
lets go in
she gets out of the car
rob turns to camera speaking quietly and urgently
okay number two the stuff i told her about being unhappy in the relationship about half looking around for someone else she tricked me into saying it
we were having this state of the union type conversation and she said quite matter of factly that we were pretty unhappy at the moment and did i agree and
i said yes and she asked whether i ever thought about meeting someone else
so i asked her if she ever thought about it and she said of course so i admitted that i daydream about it from time to time
now i see that what we were really talking about was her and ian and she suckered me into absolving her
it was a sneaky lawyers trick and i fell for it because shes much smarter than me
he scrambles out of the car
the lock turns and rob enters holding the door for laura who slips by her coat in her hands
she glances down at the table by the door and sees ians envelope
you can take it with you if you want
she slips it into her purse
he stands facing her for a moment then crosses to her takes her coat and tosses it on a chair
she opens the closet and takes out a big laundry sack
have you tackled the great reorganization yet
dont you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection
she begins putting books and other things into the bag
ive been saying that for years
having no comeback rob goes for the moral high ground
where have you been staying for the last week
i think you know that
had to work it out for myself though didnt i
laura looks suddenly tired and sad and looks away
i havent been very fair to you
thats why i came here to the store this evening
i feel terrible rob
this is really hard you know
is it my job
gimme a fucking break
is that what you think
that your not big enough a deal for me
jesus gimme a little credit rob
i dont know
its one of the things i thought of
what were the others
just the obvious stuff
whats the obvious stuff
i dont know
she stands and walks toward the bathroom
i guess its not that obvious then
as soon as she shuts the door behind her he turns to camera
and number three the pregnancy
i didnt know she was pregnant
of course i didnt
she hadnt told me because i had told her i was
seeing somebody else
we thought we were being very grown up but we were being preposterously naive childish even to think that one of us could fuck around and then own up to
it while we were living together
so i didnt find out about it til way later
we were going through a good period and i made a crack about having kids and she burst into tears
i made her tell me what it was all about and she did
i felt guilty and so i got angry
she told me that at the time i didnt look like a very good long term bet
that it was a hard decision and she didnt see any point in consulting me about it
when the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big we hear the bathroom door open
covering what what
laura comes out with a toiletry bag and places it by the door
did you say something
is it working out with ian
dont be childish
why is that childish
your living with the guy
im just asking how its going
i am not living with him
ive just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what im doing
look this has nothing to do with anyone else
you know that dont you
i left because we werent exactly getting along and we werent talking about it
and i suddenly realized that i like my job and i like what my life is could be turning into and that im getting to a point where i want
to get my shit together and i cant really see that ever happening with you and yeah yeah i sort of get interested in someone else and that went further than it should have so it seemed like a good time to go
but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run
well then why dont you quit it while you seem to not be ahead
laura rolls her eyes and head off into the bedroom with the laundry bag
rob turns back to camera
when the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big lump like that even the most shortsighted jerk even the most self deluding and self pitying of jilted wounded
lovers can see that there is some cause and effect going on here that abortions and ian and money and affairs all belong to all deserve each other
laura reappears her bag half filled with clothes and goes to the book shelves next to the records
she starts topping off the bag with books
maybe youll grow up and well get it together you and me
maybe ill never see either of you again
i dont know
all i know is that its not a good time to be living here
so what you havent definitely decide to dump me
theres still a chance well get back together
i dont know
well if you dont know theres a chance right
its like if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said i dont know if hes got a chance of survival or not then
that doesnt mean the patients definitely going to die now does it
it means he might live
even if its only a remote possibility
i suppose so
so we have a chance of getting back together again
oh rob shut up
hey i just want to know where i stand
what chance i dont fucking know what chance you fucking have
she abandons her attempt at packing
well if you could tell me roughly it would help
okay okay we have a nine percent chance of getting back together
does that clarify the situation
shaking her head im too tired for this now
i know im asking a lot but will you take off for a while so i can get my stuff packed up
i need to be able to think while i do it and i cant think while youre here
if i can ask one question
it sounds stupid
you wont like it
just ask it
is it better
is what better
better than what
sex i guess
is sex with him better
jesus christ rob
is that really whats bothering you
of course it is
you really think it would make a difference either way
i dont know
well the answer is that i dont know either
we havent done it yet
i havent felt like it
but not even before when he was living upstairs
i was living with you remember
weve slept together but we havent made love
but ill tell you one thing
the sleeping together is better
trying not to smile the sleeping together is better but not the sex because you havent done it was him yet
will you please just go
rob shuts the door behind him and does a crazy charleston cabbage patch boxstep touchdown dance of pure elation then bounces down the stairs
rob bounces along a smile wider than we have seen yet
maybe even jumping to touch an awning
he lands and tells us i feel good
i feel great
i feel like a new man
i feel so much better in fact rob moves through the room still grinning a bit like a proud new father toward the table where barry dick marie and t
bone sit listening to a story t bone is telling
marie turns to him
everything go alright
rob glances at barry who averts his gaze
she just wanted to pick up some stuff
no big thing
a relief actually
god i hate that time
that pick up stuff time
i just went through that before i came here
you know that song patsy cline times two i play
thats about me and my ex dividing up our record collections
its a great song
rob glances at t bone his mind calculating the new info
is that why you came to chicago in the first place
because of you know dividing up your record collection and stuff
marie slides closer turning her back on the others
the loop is closed
you share a place with t bone
id cramp his style
and i wouldnt want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall
im way to unattached for that
i understand completely
rob and marie lean in to each other everyone else out of focus
awhile back dick and barry and i agreed that what really matters is what you like not what you are like
yeah but if you heard this band called the crumblers youd what do you mean the crumblers
you know the crumblers
nobodys heard the crumblers
yeah i know the crumblers
i bought a used blasters album in new york about ten years ago and somebody left a crumblers single in it
my everything changed for a couple of weeks
rob glows books records films these things matter
call me shallow but its the damn truth and by this measure i was having one of the best dates of my life
yeah but you know whats his best film and nobodys even seen it
fucking ex actly
laughs you havent even seen it
nor have you
they just laugh and laugh references titles lyrics flew and met each other in mid air embraces
the evening goes with breathtaking precision
rob and marie are kissing standing up
are you okay
but i wouldnt be if i thought this was the end of the evening
im sure it isnt
in that case ill fix us something else to drink
you sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee
marie goes into the kitchen and they keep talking around the corner
tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees rob standing and holding his jacket
id better go
i gotta get up early
go over to my parents
when i said before that i hoped it wasnt the end of the evening i was you know
talking about breakfast and stuff
she plants the whiskeys firmly on the coffee table
id like it if you could stay the night
as if it is dawning on him oh right
jesus so much for delicacy
i pegged you for a master of understatement beating around the bush and all that buzz
i use it but i dont understand it when other people use it
so youll stay
marie picks up the drinks again and exits to the bedroom
rob just stands there
and the lighting changes
to camera over nine million men in this country have slept with ten or more women
and do they all look like richard gere
are they all as rich as bill gates
charming as oscar wilde
nothing to do with any of that
maybe fifty or so have one or more of these attributes but that still leaves
well about nine million give or take fifty
and theyre just men
were just guys because i even i am a member of this exclusive nine million member club
in fact marie is my seventeenth lover
how does he do it
he wears bad sweaters hes grumpy hes broke he hangs out with the musical moron twins and he gets to go to bed with a recording artist who looks like
susan dey slash meg ryan
whats going on
listen up because i think i can explain with all modesty aside i ask questions
thats my secret
it works precisely because that isnt how youre supposed to do it if you listen to the collective male wisdom
there are still enough old style big mouthed egomaniacs running around to make someone like me appear to be refreshingly different
if you cant hack this simple strategy there are some women out there of course who want to get pushed around ignored and mowed over but do you really want
to be with them anyway
he goes through a door into the bedroom
marie is taking off her earrings
would you like me to turn the lights out
or would you like them on
god you ask a lot of questions
rob stares at the ceiling as marie sleeps on next to him
but in the morning we were just two people slightly hung over who were not in love sharing the same space
and i feel
rob looks to the camera
sex is about the only grown up thing that i know how to do its weird then that its the only thing that can make me feel like a ten
the two of them come out of the building and into the street
which way are you going
points left that way
points right that way
and so it is
ill talk to you later
ill call you
dick prices records out on the floor
rob leans against the register
barry sits on a stool next to him
theyre top fiving it
robs heart isnt in it
top five side one track ones
janie jones the clash from the clash
thunder road bruce springsteen from born to run
smells like teen spirit nirvana nevermind
oh no rob thats not obvious enough
not at all
dick did you hear that
lets get it on marvin gaye from lets get it on
airbag radiohead from ok computer
a kind of recent record
robs sly declaration of new classic status slipped into a list of old classics
lets get it on
couldnt you make it more obvious than that
whispers its laura
rob springs to his feet takes the phone and walks to the end of the cord
ive been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and im thinking i didnt take them with me
have you seen them around
ill look for em
how you doing
im sorry to call but i need that stuff
fine im sure its in the file at home
ill call you when i find it and then well talk
well talk some other time
rob comes back to the counter and hangs up the phone
what about the beatles
what about the fucking rolling stones
what about fucking
track one side one of the fifth symphony
you shouldnt be allowed to run a record shop
you shouldnt be allowed to sfx barrys voice fades out
robs mouth slacks and he stares off
theres something different about the sound of her voice
and what did she mean last night she hasnt slept with him yet
what does yet mean anyway
i havent seen
evil dead ii yet
what does that mean
it means youre going to go doesnt it
youre like a little squirrel of music storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music musical lint old shit shit shit barry if i were to say to you
i havent seen evil dead ii yet what would that mean
barry just looks at rob
he pulls out a game boy and begins playing
come on what would it mean to you
i havent seen evil dead ii yet
to me it would mean that youre a liar
you saw it twice
once with laura oops once with me and dick
we had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off screen in the fourteenth century
yeah yeah i know
but say i hadnt seen it and i said to you i havent seen evil dead ii yet what would you think
barry shuts off the game boy
id think you were a cinematic idiot
and id feel sorry for you
no but would you think from that one sentence
that i was going to see it
im sorry rob but im struggling here
i dont understand any part of this conversation
youre asking me what i would think if you told me that you hadnt seen a film that youve seen
what am i supposed to say
just listen to me
if i said to you i havent seen evil dead ii yet yeah yeah i hear you would you
would you get the impression that i wanted to see it
you couldnt have been desperate to see it otherwise youd have already gone
barry finally considers
but the word yet
yeah you know what id get the impression that you wanted to see it
otherwise youd say you didnt really want to
but in your opinion would i definitely go
how the fuck am i supposed to know that
you might get sick of people telling you youve really gotta go see the movie
why would they care
because its a brilliant film
its funny violent and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass
they look at each other for a strange moment
i never thought i would say this but can i go work now
lets pack it up
we havent had a customer in four hours
fine by me
i still want pay to oclock
i cant go to the club tonight guys
dick smiles sheepishly
who are you going to see
barrys eyes widen
rob looky looky
are you getting some
un fucking believable
dicks out on a hot date robs boning marie lasalle and the best looking and most intelligent of all of us isnt getting anything at all
how do you know about that
oh come on rob
what am i an idiot
im more bothered by dicks thing
how did this happen dick
what rational explanation can there possibly be
whats her name
barry is going a little hard
dick shrinks back
anna green gables
the mossy thing
the swamp thing
is she all green and furry
shut the fuck up barry
yeah you would say that wouldnt you
you two have to stick together now
united in getting some
barry picks up his bag and heads for the door
dont be sad barry
youll find true love someday
suck my ass
rob looks to dick who looks guilty
dont worry about it dick
barrys an asshole
ill see you tomorrow rob
rob watches the door close behind him and looks out over the empty store
he talks to camera as he goes to the light switches and begins shutting them off one by one
why does it bother barry that much that dick is seeing someone
hes worried about how his life is turning out and hes lonely and lonely people are the bitterest of them all
until all the lights are out
robs silhouette slips out the door
a downpour is on
rob has himself wedged into a phone booth the little kind
into phone hi
im right outside
i figured i could just walk you to the train and you could go
or whatever it is
of course not okay
ill be right here
rob stands under the overhang watching laura walk the long hallway from the elevators to the door
laura looks different
less stress out more in control
something has happened maybe something real or maybe something in her head
whatever it is you can see that she thinks shes started out on some new stage in her life
im not going to let her
she emerges from doors says something to him and they start walking sharing her umbrella
rob and laura have just sat down in a booth
so how are you
have you slept with him yet
i told you i slept with him
no not i mean have you you know is that why you wanted to see me
what do you want me to say
i want you to say that you havent and i want it to be the truth
she looks past him
i cant do that
she starts to say something else but rob is up and out
rob pushes through the rush hour raincoats seeming to be the only one going his way
rob is soaking slumped in his chair his headphones on and the stereo lit up behind him
he talks a little loud due to the headphones
tonight were gonna figure out the five best angry songs about women
he holds up a stack of records and cds
you kind of have to start with elvis costello but where
i want you
i hope youre happy now
his records should be sealed in cases that say in case of vicious betrayal smash glass
where did you sleep last night sure but by robert johnson or by nirvana
maybe a liz phair track
there are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with
some devils advocate stuff
the silver jews could be good when youre ready to start putting it all behind you
but i think were getting ahead of ourselves there
bob fucking dylan
now bob dylan would the phone rings
he pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing
you must have known it would happen
you couldnt have been entirely unprepared
like you said ive been living with the guy
we were bound to get around to it sometime
she laughs a bit nervously
machine and anyway i keep trying to tell you thats not really the point is it
the point is we got ourselves into an awful mess rob
are you there
what are you thinking
barely a whisper nothing
we can meet for another drink if you want
so i can explain it better
i owe you that much
look i gotta go
i work too you know
will you call me
i dont have your number
call me at work
we can arrange to meet properly
i dont want this to be the last conversation we have
i know what youre like
you do huh
he hangs up and stares at the wall for awhile
he gets a beer from the fridge and sits back down
he picks up the phone and dials
yes a residence a mr
ian raymond north side
he writes down a number and hangs up then looks to camera
you know the worst thing about being rejected
the complete lack of control due to loss of control
he picks up the phone and dials while continuing to talk to us if i could only control the when and how of being dumped by somebody then it wouldnt
seem as bad
but then of course he hangs up quickly it wouldnt be rejection would it
it would be mutual consent
it would be musical differences
i would be pursuing a solo career
rob is tucked into a phone booth across the street
he can see the silhouettes of laura and ian in the window
he picks up the phone drops a quarter and hits the numbers hard as he dials
a muffled male hello
is heard and rob hangs up
he does it again
until still an unpacked box or two but its set up a framed woodstock the movie poster stacks of new fiction a bread maker you get the idea
ian is shorter than laura scruffier than rob and looks not unlike leo sayer steve guttenberg
he stares at laura with amused exasperation
she picks up the phone hello
i figured it was
re traffic noise where are you
i think the big question here is where are you if you dont mind my saying so and i think i know where you are
on the run
youre running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship and youre just going to hit it again with ian but its going to be with a world music
bunny rabbit looking earth shoe wearing doctor who watching twit who doesnt really understand you not the way that i do and will more in the future and youll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that youre in now only later
im not hold on
she walks into another room shutting the door behind her
on a bookshelf is a picture of a younger ian in a tunic emoting on some college stage
she turns it face down
im not in love with ian okay
she wanders over to the window looking out absently
she sees rob down there at the phone booth
are you still in love with me
i do not know
ill talk to you later
think about what i said
i mean if you want to experiment or whatever indignant im not experimenting
why dont you go experiment
i dont want to
dont need to
i love you
you dont ever think about other people
i mean i think about it
but no i dont really think about it
through the door laura
are you okay
covering the mouthpiece to ian i am fine
to rob i gotta go
she clicks the phone off
the door cracks and ian sticks his head in
are you sure youre okay
she moves past him back into the apartment
yeah im fine
im off the phone
you look upset
im upset but im fine
maybe i should talk to him
not a good idea
conflict resolution is my job laura
nothing to resolve ian
lets get a drink
she grabs her coat and opens the door
the phone begins to ring
waving toward the door cmon cmon
rob stands on the sidewalk in the rain ians building behind him and down a few doors
i wish i could be one of those guys who doesnt call the kind of guy that gets broken up with and appears not to give a shit
he doesnt make an ass out of himself or frighten anybody and this week ive done both of those things
one day lauras sorry and guilty and the next shes scared and angry and im entirely responsible for the transformation and it doesnt do my case any good at all
id stop if i could but i his head turns at the sharp sound of a door opening ian and laura are coming out of the building
he jumps behind a tree peering around it as they fade down the street
rob sits alone nursing a scotch
rob looks up into the mirror behind the bar and sees an older woman mrs
ashworth sitting alone a few stools down
do i know you
i dont know
rob remembers and his gaze has a new found seriousness
an old boyfriend of youre daughters
alisons moms brow furrows and her face darkens
long time ago
i was just thinking about her
i was her first boyfriend
alisons mom what did you say your name was
circa junior high
i hate to quibble with you rob but she married her first boyfriend
you gotta be kidding me
she lives in australia
she doesnt seem too happy that alison lives in australia
rob is thrilled
her junior high sweetheart
what chance would i have had against that
none no chance
thats just fate
i beg your pardon
technically im number one
i went out with her a week before kevin did
her first boyfriend
well rob ill tell her you said hello
if she remembers you
alisons mom strolls out
calling after her i think she will
but its okay if she doesnt
im fine now
rob turns to the bartender smiling giddily
rob walks through uptown toward the train
and suddenly i am fine
for the moment there is not one extra pound on my chest
this is fate
alison married kevin
you get it
thats got nothing to do with me that is beyond my control beyond my fault
rob into camera digging through a box fishing through pictures and letters concert tickets and other mementos
he begins to assemble a small pile of pictures of women
i want to see the others on the big top five
penny who wouldnt let me touch her and then went and had sex with that bastard chris thompson
sarah my partner in rejection who rejected me and charlie who i have to thank for everything my great job my sexual self confidence the works
theres this springsteen song bobby jean off born in the usa
about a girl whos left town years before and hes pissed off because he didnt know about it and he wanted to say goodbye tell her that he missed her
and wish her good luck
well id like my life to be like a springsteen song
i know im not born to run and its clear that halsted street is nothing like thunder road but feelings cant be that different can they
id like to call up all those people and ask them how they are and whether theyve forgiven me and tell them that i have forgiven them
and say good luck goodbye
no hard feelings
and then theyd feel good and id feel good
wed all feel good
id feel clean and calm and ready to start again
thatd be good
rob holds an old crumpled address book in one hand and the phone in the other
this is rob gordon
from high school
rob and penny walk out of the theater mid conversation
they look happy as they walk down the street
penny is as beautiful as she was in high school when i broke it off with her because she wouldnt sleep with me
in fact shes even more beautiful and really grown into herself
a mid scale trattoria
rob and penny sit at table laughing and talking
if we didnt know better we might think there is chemistry
she tells me about her life and i get it
and i tell about mine and shes interested
and then with no real explanation i just launch into it i tell her about laura and ian and charlie and marco and about alison ashworth and kevin bannister
and you wanted to sleep with chris thompson instead of me and
and i thought you could help me understand why it keeps happening why im doomed to be left doomed to be rejected and
he slows to a stop
we see penny as she goes from happy to livid
i was crazy about you
i wanted to sleep with you one day but not when i was sixteen
when you broke up with me when you broke up with me because i was to use your charming expression tight i cried and cried and i hated you
and then that little shitbag asked me out and i was too tired to fight him off and it wasnt rape because i said okay but it wasnt far off
and i didnt have sex with anyone else until after college because i hated it so much
and now you want to have a chat about rejection
well fuck you rob
penny stands and leaves
rob just sits
cheerful so thats another one i dont have to worry about
i should have done this years ago
rob indicates to an off screen waiter
rob to camera
sarahs easy to find
she still sends me christmas cards with her address and phone number on them
they never say anything else except for merry christmas love sarah
i send her equally blank ones back
of a door opening revealing sarah a few years older but still pretty in her mousey way
she looks at rob with a bit too much in her eyes
rob and sarah face each other over a half eaten pizza
i cant believe i left you for him
sarah looks down at her plate shaking her head blushing
rob looks uncomfortable
this is more than he was looking for
probably seemed like a good idea at the time
she looks up again
i cant remember why though
and back down again
i havent got the heart for the rejection conversation
there are no hard feelings here and i am glad that she ditched me and not the other way around
sarah in the doorway smiles painfully
its clear she doesnt want to shut the door but she does
rob turns and walks down the hall toward the door to the street as he talks i couldve ended up having sex back there
and what better way to exorcize rejection demons than to screw the person who rejected you right
but you wouldnt be sleeping with a person
youd be sleeping with a whole sad single person culture
itd be like sleeping with talia shire in rocky if you werent rocky
as robs finger moves down the column then stops
rob looks up with a little shock almost recoiling from the phone book
rob to camera
charlies in the fucking phone book
she has come to assume such an importance i feel she should be living on mars
shes an extraterrestrial a ghost a myth not a person with an answering machine in the phone book
i call and hang up on her voice mail a couple of times then i leave my name and number and throw in a long time no see
i dont hear anything back from her for a few days
now thats more like it if youre talking about rejection someone who wont even return your phone messages a decade after she rejected you
rob hears the door open as he stocks shelves and turns
rob reacts gunfighter eyes
can i help you
rob says nothing
i thought maybe we should talk
sort a few things out
rob is disoriented on the way to angry
dick and barrys ears perk up
what needs sorting out
come on rob
my relationship with laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal
funnily enough i havent been too thrilled about it
we are not talking jokey understatement here rob
were talking actionable harassment
ten phone calls a night hanging around outside my house
yeah well ive stopped all that now
weve noticed and were glad
but you know
how are we going to make peace here
we want to make things easier for you
what can we do
obviously i know how special laura is and i know things cant be good for you at the moment
id hate it if i lost her
but id like to think that if she decided she didnt want to see me anymore id respect that decision
do you see what im saying
so shall we leave it at that then
think about it rob
rob looking sure of himself righteous
so shall we leave it at that then
ive already left it you pathetic rebound fuck
now get your patchouli stink out of my store
ian leaves rattled
so shall we leave it at that then
we wont leave it ian
rob springs toward ian but barry blocks his way
dick helps hold rob back
dont do it rob
hes not worth it
rob reaches a pointed finger over barrys shoulder
leave the country you little bitch because youre gonna look back on walks by the house and ten phone calls a night as a golden age
get ready mutherfucker
ian trips backward and scurries out the door
rob dick and barry just beating the living shit out of ian rodney king style
ian lies on the floor trying to cover himself
dick already out of breath breaks from the pack and jerks the air conditioner from the wall and hefts it over his head preparing for the death blow
so shall we leave it at that then
think about it rob
ian walks out
rob looks spent
he shuffles toward the back of the store
rob is laying on his back staring at the ceiling
dick sticks his head in the door
somebody named charlie
rob pulls the phone into the bathroom and shuts the door
rob curls up with the phone
charlie looks even better than when we saw her in college
rob hi so sorry i missed your call
in la on business
you know how it gets
seems like a million years ago now
how are you
fantastic but im a little busy right now
do you want to come to dinner saturday
im having some friends over and i need a spare man
are you a spare man
yes at the moment
see you then
sexy version of a hip wine commercial a small mid thirties crowd of successful beautiful people
rob sits at the table silently as the other guests talk and eat
robs central activities are working his way through maybe a few too many wines making sure his cigarette smoke doesnt get in anyones face
his eyes occasionally dart around the table but he says nothing to anyone
rob is a little too settled into the couch somewhat bleary
everyone gone but the two of them charlie plops down into a chair across from rob
why did you break up with me for marco
on her feet fuck
i knew it
youre going through one of those what does it all mean things
theres been a rash of them recently
i find it a little unnerving
in fact marco called a few months back and he wanted to see me and rehash the past as they say and i wasnt really up for it
do all men go through this
cmon just answer the question
you can say what you like
what the hell
charlie looks off at a corner of the ceiling musters a look of contemplation
its all kind of lost in the
in the dense mists of time now
it wasnt that i really liked marco more
in fact i thought you were more shall we say attractive than him
it was just that he knew he was good looking and you didnt and that made a difference somehow
you used to act as if i was weird for wanting to spend time with you and that got kind of beat if you know what i mean
your self image started to rub off on me and i ended up thinking that i was strange
and i knew that you were kind and thoughtful
you made me laugh and i dug the way you got consumed by things you loved
and marco seemed a bit more i dont know glamorous
more sure of himself
pause less hard work because i felt like i was dragging you around sort of
pause a little sunnier
pause i dont know
you know what people are like at that age
they make very superficial judgements
do you think thats superficial
he was a clown if its any consolation
did you tell that to marco when he did his what does it all mean thing with you
oh god no
i didnt want to hurt his feelings
rob to camera
i wanted the works and i got it
none of alison ashworths fate none of sarahs rewriting of history and no reminder that id got all the rejection stuff a little backward like i did about penny
just a perfectly clear explanation of why some people have it and some dont
all ive learned from charlie is that maybe my one talent my genius for being normal is a little overrated
rob enters the already open store in a bad mood to find barry putting up a poster
it reads barrytown appearing saturday night bucktown pub hey
what the fuck is that
the band that found me and asked me to join
you are not in a band barry
you are not a musician
and no posters
thanks for your support rob
really appreciate it
is there no end to your arrogance
i didnt make up the name
its the steely dan song
and it was in the commitments
you cant be called barry and sing in a group called barrytown
they were fucking called that before i was in it okay
it wasnt my idea
thats why you got the gig isnt it
barry says nothing
that was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally yes
thats fucking great
they only asked you to sing because of your name
you can stick it above the browser racks over there
how many tickets can i put you down for
youre not even coming
of course im not coming
do i look like id want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave
where is it
looks at the poster the fucking bucktown pub
so much for friends then
youre a bitter bastard rob you know that
because im not in barrytown
you should be shot like a lame horse you jerk
re the poster just keep that out of my window
rob opens the door to find laura filling a duffel bag in the living room
i called and called but you were out
i thought id be gone before you got back
is that the last of it
i might have missed some stuff
im so used to some things being here that i dont even notice them
those look heavy
hes at home
listen i cant believe he went to the store
im mortified actually
im really sorry
he had no right to do that and i told him so
it was kind of funny
you still together
going all right
i dont really want to talk about it to be honest
that bad eh
you know what i mean
rob flops onto the couch and surveys the room
its a dump isnt it
laura sits down on the other side of the couch
fix it up
itll make you feel better
ill bet you cant remember what you were doing here can you
i mean how much are you making now
and you were living in this shitty place
you know i didnt mind
and its not as if rays place is any better
im sorry but can we get this straight
what is his fucking name ian or ray
what do you call him
i hate ian
i hate him too
so i just call him mavis
or mavis the sissyboy
laura starts laughing laying on the couch on her back very close to rob
rob leans in sort of looking down into her eyes
this is where youre supposed to say that you havent laughed this much in ages and then you see the error of your ways
you make me laugh much more than ray does if thats what youre getting at
but i already knew you could make me laugh
its everything else i dont know about
you know im a good person
you know that i can cook my ass off when i feel like it
oh ho so very infrequently
he moves a little closer
you know my favorite beverage is your bath water
he moves in not really trying to kiss her but leaving the door open for her
she almost goes for it but instead gets to her feet
time to go
she goes to her bags
rob points to a pile of cds
dont forget your cds
those arent mine
sure they are
theyre not really though are they
i know you bought them for me and that was really sweet of you but that was when you were trying to turn me into you
i cant take them i know theyd just sit around staring at me and id feel embarrassed by them and
they dont fit in with the rest of whats mine do you understand
that sting record you bought for me
that was a present for me
i like sting and you hate him
but the rest of this stuff
bending down to the pile who the hell is nick lowe
or gram parsons
or the boredoms
i dont know these people
i get the picture
im sorry to go on about it
but i dont know theres a lesson here somewhere and i want to make sure you get it
i got it
you like sting but you dont like gram parsons because youve never heard of him
youre being deliberately obtuse
i guess i am
well think about it
she hefts the duffel bag opens the door and exits
rob to the camera
whats the point in thinking about it
if i ever have another relationship ill buy her whoever she is stuff that she oughta like but doesnt know about thats what new boyfriends are for
and hopefully i wont borrow money from her or have an affair and she wont need to have an abortion or run away with the neighborhood and then there wont
be anything to think about
laura didnt run off with ian because i bought her cds she wasnt that keen on and to pretend otherwise is just
if she thinks that then shes missing the brazilian rainforest for the twigs
if i cant buy the plastic people of the universes first album for new girlfriends then i might as well give up because im not sure i know how to
do anything else
rob walks toward the record store and looks into a starbucks window he passes
he stops for a second seeing ian at the counter chatting merrily with the espresso jockey
rob keeps walking
rob tosses his coat down and picks up the phone and dials
muffled almost a whisper hello
hey how ya doin
guess who i just saw right by my store
i cant talk right now
god thats a cold and a half
maybe you should bet back in bed
are you alright
dont worry about it
just get into bed
worry about that when youre better
who the fucks pig
louder my dad died
my dad my dad
she hangs up
rob comes out of the back in a daze
dick and barry notice
her dad died
barry goes back to his comic book and burrito
im sorry rob thats its youre a horrible person barry
i mean it
barry looks up at him shrugs then gets an idea
top five songs about death
a lauras dad tribute list
nobody can help thinking about it
okay okay leader of the pack
the guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right
dead mans curve jan and dean
did you know that after that song was recorded jan himself crashed his it was dean you fucking idiot
it was jan and it was a long time after whatever
tell laura i love her
thatd bring the house down
lauras mom could sing it
fuck off barry
id want one step beyond by madness
and you cant always get what you want
because its in the big chill
havent seen it
we saw it in the lawrence kasdan double bill with body heat
but id forgotten about that
i wasnt biting the idea
the phone rings
rob picks it up
laura is curled up on the couch
dick and barry keep listing
when are you going home
in a minute
when i get it together
to dick what about sabbath
theyre into death
rob tries to signal to them to shut up but they dont see him
he moves as far away as the cord will let me
can i do anything
abraham martin and john
thats a nice one
somebodys gonna die by blitz
bella lugosis dead bauhaus
its got that creepy halloween feeling
mom wants you to come to the funeral
its on friday
my dad liked you
and mom never told him wed split because he wasnt up to it and
oh i dont know
i dont really understand it
i think she thinks hell be able to see whats going on
small laugh hes been through so much what with dying and everything that she doesnt want to upset him any more than she has to
do you want me to be there
i dont care
as long as you dont expect me to hold your hand
rob is silent
look are you coming or not
yes of course
lizll give you a lift
she knows where to go and everything
i dont have time to talk rob
ive got too much to do
ill see you on friday
she hangs up
to the tune of candle in the wind goodbye lauras dad blah blah la di da di da belting it out seems to me you lived your life like a
dentist in the wind
rob stomps toward barry who jumps over the counter to keep singing thunderclaps and rain
rob is in a somber suit looking through the windshield wipers as liz drives
so the minister says nice things and then what we all troop outside and they bury him
its a crematorium
what difference does it make
is ray going
they dont know him
and ken liked you
rob ken didnt die for your benefit you know
its like everybodys a supporting actor in the film of your life story
isnt that how it is for everybody
liz and rob sit in the back of the dark smallish nondenominational room
at the front is a coffin resting on a stand
laura her younger sister jo and her mother sit in the front row listening to the minister
now and forever amen
he nods offstage and a muffled mechanical noise is heard
the coffin begins to lower through a trap door beneath it
a low baleful human howl is heard starting quietly but gaining in volume
i hear something in lauras voice but i know what it is and at that moment i want to go to her and offer to become a different person to
remove all trace of what is me as long as she will let me look after her and try to make her feel better
rob stays back watching mourners approach laura and her mother hugging them
after awhile laura sees rob through the throng hanging back
she breaks through and to him holding him close for a long time
and when she lets go of me i feel i dont need to become a different person
its happened already
a cozy old victorian house full of things furniture paintings ornaments plants which dont go together but which have obviously been chosen with care and taste
rob and liz stand drinking wine
jo approaches them
to jo how are you
im all right i suppose
and moms not too bad
shes had a pretty rough few weeks already without this
its hard when youre putting all of your efforts into one part of your life and it doesnt work out
she glances at rob embarrassed
sincere dont mind me
just pretend youre talking about somebody else
jo smiles liz gives him a look
we are talking about somebody else
laura and ray actually
rob begins to turn red
anger sorrow everything else building
enough of what
getting louder i know i cant speak now because lauras father died and i just have to take it because otherwise im a bad guy with the emphasis on guy
well im fucking not not all the time anyway im really sorry jo
lowering his voice but you know liz
i can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself
and maybe you think i should but its not much of a life you know
maybe ive been a little unfair
but is this really the time
only because its never the time
i cant go on apologizing my whole life you know
if by we you are referring to men then i have to say that just the once would do
rob looks around the room beginning to hyperventilate and near tears
he sees laura in a corner of the room surrounded by four or five mourners
he crosses to them and breaks through to her
he breaks away from her and slips out the front door
so darkened by weather that it is almost night raining torrents and big sheets
rob emerges from the front door of lauras parents house and begins walking down the street hands thrust into his pockets
the rain almost immediately soaks him
in the distance rob runs toward us
as he gets to us we move with him down the street
he is drenched
we hear the rain and his ragged breath
headlights appear behind him and backlight him getting brighter as the sound of an engine gets louder
rob takes a look over his shoulder looks desperately left and right and vaults himself over a small brick wall and into a flower bed landing on his back in
the black wet earth
the big drops of rain splash mud on his face and he burrows deeper into the dirt and flowers with his back panting and staring up at the sky
off camera the car engine catches up and a door opens and shuts
he sighs and shuts his eyes
he opens his eyes again to see lauras face wet as well staring down at him
it is difficult to distinguish rain from tears
are you going to lie in that flower bed all night
but rob keeps lying there
laura pulls herself to a sitting position on the wall just above him
youre also an idiot
rob pulls his muddy self to his feet and sits on the wall next to her
i can see why you say that
look im sorry
i really am
the last thing i wanted was
thats why i left because
i lost it and i didnt want to blow my top in there and
look the reason i fucked everything up was because i was scared
i just wanted you to know thats all
i appreciate it
i cant reciprocate
what do you mean
i didnt mess things up because i was scared
i slept with ray because i was sick of you
and i needed something to snap me out of it
sure i understand
look i dont want to take up any more of your time
you get back and ill wait here for a bus
i dont want to go back
what do you want to do
they swing their legs over the wall and walk to lauras vw
they drive sort of aimlessly through lauras old neighborhood
laura sees something on her left and makes a sudden turn up a narrow road through some overgrown trees
they come to a stop in a formerly paved clearing looking out on a field with an old abandoned school on the other side
laura shuts down the engine
when are you going back
i dont know
listen rob would you have sex with me
i want to feel something else than this
its either that or i go home and put my hand in the fire
unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm
ive only got a couple left
im saving them for later
itll have to be sex then
she pulls herself over him staddling him in the passenger seat and kissing his neck
she pauses and regards him from above
it doesnt seem so long ago that i looked at you from here
i knew there was a reason i wore a skirt today
laura reaches down and unzips his pants as they keep kissing
you know with ray
oh rob were not going to go through that again
are you still on the pill
yes of course
theres nothing to worry about
i didnt mean that
was that all you used
laura looks at him motionless then begins to cry
look we can do other things
i lived with you
you were my partner just a few weeks ago and now youre worried i might kill you and youre entitled to worry
isnt that a terrible thing
isnt that sad
she rolls off of him into her seat
they sit there in silence watching the rain run down the windshield
rob to camera
later i wonder if i was really worried about where ian has been
i have no idea where hes been and that gives me every right to insist on protection
but in truth it was the power that interested me more than the fear
i wanted to hurt her on this day of all days just because its the first time since shes left that ive been able to
rob and laura lean back in a booth facing each other
we get that feeling that not another word has been spoken since we last saw them
im too tired not to go out with you
rob leans forward
so if you had a bit more energy wed stay split
but things being how they are what with you wiped out youd like us to get back together
nodding everythings too hard
maybe another time i would have the guts to be on my own but not now i dont
what about ian
rays a disaster
i dont know what that was all about except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade i guess and
blow it all apart
i know its not very romantic but there will be romance again at some stage im sure
i need you rob
and we know each other and we care for each other and youve made it clear that you want me back so
she looks up at him
lets go home
rob to camera
but wouldnt you know it
suddenly i feel panicky and sick and i want to run around and sleep with female recording artists
rob and laura lie on their backs
i want to know
want to know what exactly
what it was like
it was like sex
what else could it be like
was it like good sex or was it like bad sex
whats the difference
you know the difference
look were okay now
we just had a nice time
lets leave it at that
okay thats cool okay
but the nice time we just had
was it nicer as nice or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago
laura is silent
oh cmon laura
just say something
lie if you want
itd stop me asking you questions and itd make me feel better
well i was gonna lie and now i cant because youd know i was lying
well why the fuck would you want to lie anyway
to make you feel better
rob begins to get out of bed
she grabs his hand and pulls him back down
if great sex was as important as you think it is and if i was having great sex with him then we wouldnt be lying here now
and that is my last word on the subject okay
she pulls him close and they lie there the matter seemingly settled
i wish your penis was as big as his though
he turns slowly to her
a giggle from her turns into a laugh then a howl a roar rob and laura walk the cement breakfront
or new york even
hey great idea
what ill do is tomorrow ill get a hold of a box full of mint elvis presley s on the sub label and ill pay for it that way
ill pay for you
even though you owe me money
we have to do something with the money i earn
i need to
i deserve it
you can just think of it as winning the lottery
the girlfriend lottery
money does not matter
i do not care how much you earn
id just like you to be a little happier in your work but beyond that you can do what you like
but it wasnt supposed to be like this
when i met you we were the same people and now were not and
how were we the same people
well you were the kind of person who came to the artful dodger and i was the kind of person who deejayed at the artful dodger
you wore jeans and t shirts and so did i
and i still do and you dont
because im not allowed to
i still do after work
should we just break up
is that what youre saying
because if you are im going to run out of patience
but why doesnt it matter that were not the same people we used to be
you havent changed so much as a pair of socks in the years ive known you
if weve grown apart then im the one whos done the growing and all ive done is change jobs
and hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and
i cant go to work with my hair dyed pink
and i can afford to go shopping more now and ive met a couple people i like over the last year or so
more confident maybe
are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life
yeah youre alright
but youre certainly not happy
so what happens if you get happy
and yes i know thats the title of an elvis costello album i use the reference deliberately to catch your attention
should we split up because im used to you being miserable
what happens if you i dont know start youre own record label and its a success
time for a new girlfriend
youre being stupid
what would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice
rob is silent
all im saying is you have to allow for things to happen to people most of all to yourself
otherwise whats the use
rob comes out of the stock room and walks toward the counter where dick and barry stare at the tape deck like two concerned doctors listening to a song that
is raw and moody and lyrical minor threat meets brian eno if thats possible
rob joins them in contemplation
what is this
its vince and justin
the little skate fuckers
rob and dick look at him ready to pounce pained to say it its really fucking good
dick and barry look to rob who continues to just listen
he takes a deep breath and walks to the front door and out seemingly with a mission
vince and justin are doing noisy skate tricks against the curb across the street
when they see rob they stop get ready to flee
he walks across to them
dick comes out and hovers in the background
they mumble thanks
but it shows promise
we record a couple of songs right in a studio
ill take care of the rest
ill put out your record
any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle between us and you guys
wait a minute
island records charged u a million five against their overhead for one plane ride
were not there yet justin
he begins to move toward the store
vince and justin look at each other
rob gets to the door but stops and turns
whats the name of your band
the kinky wizards
we saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin for a renaissance fair
whats the name of your label
rob looks at them
then at dick
then through the window at barry inside looking out
then at his own reflection in the window
then back at them
rob walks back inside
he seems to be shaking a little
what the fuck is that
i heard you man
dont give me that what shit
you just told them that youre gonna put out a record with them
you even said theyre good
do you see anyone else around here with a band mr
rob waves him off and disappears into the stock room
the malcolm mcclaren of clark street is in his executive suite
do you have an appointment
what are you talking about
just that rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business crippling nazi youth shoplifters than with someone he
knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary
laura puts it together and smiles
she goes to the back and crack the door finding rob sitting on a box thinking
what are you doing
wanna go to dinner
at paul and mirandas
paul from work
we dont really get along
paul and i
but youve never met
it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him
rob to camera
were at a point where i cant really walk away from gauntlets she might throw down and so i go
and wouldnt you know it i sort of fall in love with paul and miranda with what they have and the way they treat each other and the way they
make me feel as if im the new center of their world
i think theyre great and i want to see them twice a week every week for the rest of my life
only right at the end of the evening do i realize ive been set up
rob ambles in from the dining room
laura close behind
he looks through the bookshelves until he finds a meager little grouping of cds
he moves up to them and scans the titles tina turner
the windham hill sampler
rob turns around to see paul behind him
oh i dont know
the beatles are okay
were kinda out of date
hey to each his own i say
maybe we can come by your store and you can hook us up
better hurry though paul
rob started a record label so hes gonna be in the shop less and less
rob looks at her
as they come in the door
to each his own
rob gordon said that
you even sounded like you meant it
they throw their jackets over a chair
rob turns on the cd player and call me a liar by palace begins to play
smiling you did that deliberately
you knew all along id like them
it was a trick
i tricked you into meeting some people youd think were great
i thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a tina turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way
she moves to rob and wraps her arms around him
they look deeply at each other
she breaks away from him and walks into the bedroom
he turns off the stereo and follows her
rob walks to work drinking his coffee
he stops and backs up a few feet and stares at a poster on a plywood board up
i sold my moms wheelchair the debut single from the kinky wizards on broken records record release party july at the artful dodger featuring the triumphant return of dj rob
gordon dance music for old people rob scowls and storms off
rob paces laura sits on the couch smiling
i called dan koretzky because he has drag city records i know i know
you told dan koretzky about this
yeah and he said its a good way to break out a record
especially for what he said and i quote would be a highly anticipated event locally
he helped me put out a press release
just local of course
and the triumphant return of dj rob gordon
i had that idea when i was living with ian and it was such a good idea that i was annoyed we werent together anymore
it might even be why i came back
you had no right
supposing i was doing something that couldnt be cancelled
what do you ever do that cant be cancelled
thats not the point
i mean what if the single isnt done in time
barry said its done
barry knows about this
his band is playing a set
rob wheels on her
rob and barry
like fuck you are
laura said we could
if we helped out with the posters and stuff
and we did
and we are
ill give you of the door if you dont play
were getting that anyway
what is she doing
we need the gig
thats my final offer
im not kidding
thats how much it means to me not to hear you play
were not as bad as you think rob
you couldnt be
theres going to be people from lauras work there people who own dogs and babies and tina turner albums
how are you going to cope with them
were not called barrytown anymore by the by
they got sick of the barry barrytown thing
were called sdm
sonic death monkey
sonic death monkey
what do you think
dick likes it
barry youre over thirty years old
you owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called sonic death monkey
i owe it to myself to go right to the edge rob and this group does exactly that
over the edge in fact
youll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next friday night
thats what we want
and if lauras bourgeois lawyer friends cant take it then fuck em
let em riot we can handle it
well be ready
barry wanders off laughing
rob and laura
theyll go on early
nobody will even be there yet and i told them they cant play for more than a half hour
its no joke
im responsible for what happens you know
embarrassment aside theres a lot of money and effort in this at least by my standards
i have to put down a deposit for the room
i have to pay the pressing plant for the records sleeve them sticker them we took care of that
robs brow furrows
barry and dick and me
look in the bedroom
rob goes to the bedroom door and opens it
its sort of like christmas hundreds of kinky wizards cd singles painstakingly packaged and stacked on the bed
rob to camera
i suddenly feel choked up
its not the money its the way shes thought of everything one morning i woke up to find her going through my records pulling out things that she remembered me
playing when i deejayed and putting them into the little carrying cases that i used to use and put away in a closet somewhere years ago
she knew i needed a kick in the ass
she also knew how happy i was when i used to deejay
from which every angle i examine it it still looks as though shes done all of this because she loves me
rob turns from the bedroom and goes to laura putting his arms around her
im sorry ive been acting like a jerk
i do appreciate what youve done for me and i know youve done it for the best possible reasons and i do love you even though i act like i
you seem pissed off all the time though
i dont get it
rob to camera
but if i had to take a wild guess id say that im pissed because i know im stuck with laura bound to her and i dont like it
that dreamy anticipation you have when youre fifteen or twenty or thirty even that the most perfect person in the world might walk into your store or office or friends
party at any moment
thats all gone i think and thats enough to piss anybody off
laura is who i am now and its no good pretending otherwise
rob is standing shelves
a very pretty young woman caroline comes through the door and looks around
she sees rob
rob looks up and takes her in like a dish in a window
may i help you
im looking for deejay rob gordon
im caroline fortis from the reader
i want to do a story on you
well i used to go to the dodger on your nights and i saw youre doing it again and that your putting out a record and its sort of a
then and now story against the backdrop of the chicago music scene with the emphasis on now
i thought i would ask you a few questions if thats okay
you used to come to the club
i shouldnt have let you in
you must have only been about sixteen
rob realizes what he must be sounding like
he blushes and retreats
what i mean is i didnt mean you look young
you dont look old either
you look just as old as you are
a bit younger maybe but not a lot
is now a good time
rob looks around there is absolutely nothing going on in the store
she pulls out a pad and pencil
you must have an enormous record collection
i could show it to you if you want to come over and see it
he winces immediately
what are youre all time top five records
your desert island top five
in the club or at home
is there a difference
a little too shrill of course
well yeah a bit
sin city by the flying burrito brothers is an all time top five but i wouldnt play it at the club
its a country rock ballad
everybodyd go home
so four more
what do you mean four more
well if one of them is this sin city thing can i go home and work this out and let you know
in a week or so
look if you cant think of anything it doesnt matter
ill do one
my five favorite from the old days at the dodger
rob is aghast humiliated quietly outraged
oh im sure i can manage something
new rose by the damned
hit it and quit it by funkadelic
shipbuilding elvis costello japanese import no horns or different horns anyway
mystery train by elvis presley
spaced cowboy by sly and the family stone
a bit controversial i know but
is that it
well i wouldnt mind a quick chat if you got the time
sure but is that it for the list
why did you decide to deejay again
well it was a friends idea really and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it
looking over her pad at the list i should really put a james brown in there nice friend
whats his name
my friend is laura
a friend whos a girl
music for old people
what does that mean
look im sorry about this but id like the upsetter by lee scratch perry in there
instead of sin city
she scribbles and writes
dance music for old people
oh you know
a lot of people arent too old for clubs but theyre too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that
they want to hear old funk and stax and new wave and old school hip hop and some new stuff all together and theres nowhere for them
and the new label
and the kinky wizards
oh well the kinky wizards are you know what
why dont i just make you a tape
i could have deejay rob gordon play in my own home
its no problem
i love making tapes
rob to camera
a good compilation tape like breaking up is hard to do and takes ages longer than it might seem
you gotta kick off with a killer to hold the attention
then you have to take it up a notch but not blow your wad so maybe cool it off a notch and you cant put the same artist twice on
the tape except if some subtle point or lesson or theme involved and even then not the two of them in a row and you cant woo somebody with joni mitchells big yellow taxi and then bash their head off with something like gbhs city baby attacked by rats and
oh there are a lot of rules
anyway i worked hard at this one
rob sits indian style on the floor in front of the stereo
he has a pad of paper with scrawled titles and cross outs and is surrounded by piles of cds and records
whos that for
rob winces turns
oh just that woman who interviewed me for the reader
something like that
laura turns and walks out of the room
rob is tucked into the corner on the phone
oh its rob
yeah listen i have a new list for you and oh
well maybe next week they could print a uh retraction
or a correction
because the list i have now it really much more right
anyway i have your tape
shall i mail it to you
would you like to have a drink
rob to camera
how are you not going to fall for someone who wants to interview you
now caroline is all i can think about
and in the daydreams i imagine every detail the entire story of our future relationship until suddenly i realize that theres nothing left to actually like happen
ive done it all lived through it all in my head
i know the whole plot the ending and the good parts
now id have to watch it all over again in real time and wheres the fun in that
and fucking when is it all going to stop
am i going to jump from rock to rock for the rest of my life until there arent any rocks left
am i going to bolt every time i get itchy feet
because i get them about once a quarter along with the stores tax bill
ive been thinking with my guts since i was fourteen years old and frankly speaking ive come to the conclusion that my guts have shit for brains
you know whats wrong with laura what my problem is
whats wrong with laura is that ill never see her for the first or second or third time
ill probably mail the tape
rob sits at a table in the bar nervous
he watches the door sits up straight when it opens and follows someone with his eyes all the way to his table
a drinking lunch on a school day
what a nice surprise
rob says nothing
are you worried about tomorrow night
he plays with his drink
are you going to talk to me or shall i get my paper out
im going to talk to you
he plays with his drink some more
what are you going to talk to me about
im going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not
ha ha ha
hoo hoo hoo
i mean it
oh well thanks a fucking bunch
but two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader werent you
not in love exactly but
well forgive me if i dont think of you as the worlds safest bet
would you marry me if i was
shall we go
what brought all this on
i dont know
are you persuadable
i dont think so
im just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days
im just sick of thinking about it all the time
love and marriage
i want to think about something else
ive changed my mind
thats the most romantic thing ive ever heard
im only trying to explain
i mean maybe youre right
but were you really expecting me to say yes
didnt think about it really
it was the asking that was the important thing
well youve asked
she leans over and takes his hands in hers smiles at him
with the mixer in the middle
just begun by jimmy castor spins on turntable
a hand reaches in and begins to draw the slides down quieting the music
rob looks up from behind the deejay table set up amongst the instruments
the place is packed with people and everyone seems to be having a great time
almost everyone rob sees barry who pretends to nod off when rob catches his eye and justin who looks back at him and mocks a bulimic act
rob gives him the finger
he sees laura and she beams at him
he comes to the front of the stage and taps a microphone
uh thanks for uh coming out tonight
i hope you have a good time
and i hope you like the record
the one by the kinky wizards
the record that were having this record release party for
hoots from the crowd thanks
listen to it first though
well get to that later
right now id like to introduce
mumbles sonic death monkey
good natured applause
rob steps down and bee lines to laura
barry and his crew mount the stage
rob takes a big gulp of beer
to laura im an idiot
i should have played the record first
this place is about to get burned down
its gonna be fine
these people are ready for anything
dubious yeah well
barry stands in front of the mic surveying the crowd with a smile
he and the band all wear suits and ties
thanks for the enthusiastic intro rob
were not called sonic death monkey anymore though ladies and gentlemen
we might be on the verge of becoming the atavistics but we havent decided yet
but tonight we are
barry jive and the uptown five
one two three and they launch into marvin gayes got to give it up almost flawlessly faithful to the original
barry is transformed shuffling footwork a wide smile and when the intro winds up an almost perfect falsetto
the crowd goes nuts filling the floor
rob is stunned begins to smile
laura takes his hand and leads him out into the crowd
