eisenhowers farewell address to the nation the conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the american experience
the total influence economic political even spiritual is felt in every city every statehouse every office of the federal government
in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes
we should take nothing for granted

the cuban exiles and the cia are furious at kennedys irresolution

texas is a crucial state for him to carry in

on the morning of november he speaks in fort worth then flies minutes to love field in dallas where he takes a motorcade through downtown dallas on his way to

he has a violent epileptic fit that attracts surrounding attention
dallas policemen run over to him
we hear the siren of an ambulance roaring up
timecut to ambulance loading the epileptic man and taking off
we are en route to parkland
back to a montage of the shooting
we see kennedy in the last seconds waving turning the corner at houston from main
we see tv footage and a piece of zapruder film from before the shooting fragmented images
cut to stages shots of crowd people looking on
the images are grainy to match the tone of the zapruder film
people are on rooftops hollering
the crowd is wild with enthusiasm
we pan past jack ruby and slam into him in black and white
the camera shows a cuban man with a radio a man with an umbrella subliminals
through open windows on the fifth floor of the criminal courts building convicts watch and holler from their jail cells
we see the sixth floor of the texas book depository with open windows and a vague blur of a figure and a rifle
the clock on the hertz sign reads
well be there in about five minutes
a motorcycle officer paralleling the kennedy car tries to use his radio
the sound of the jammed dictabelt drives the rest of the sequence
we see zapruder a short middle aged man shooting his mm film from the grassy knoll and then we see jackie kennedy floating on film her voice high soft voice
restaged and in the motorcade you know i usually would be waving mostly to the left side and he was waving mostly to the right which is one reason youre not looking at each other very much
and it was terribly hot
just blinding all of us
we could see a tunnel in front of us
everything was really slow then
and i remember thinking it would be so cool under that tunnel
the camera rests on jackie for a beat and then we see the shot of the little schoolgirl skipping on the grass
cut to the approaching overpass
connally turns to j
the shot is crazy fractured surreal
president you cant say that dallas doesnt love you
no you certainly cant
then we hear the shots the volley sounds like a motorcycle backfire
we catch a glimpse of a muzzle flash and smoke
we see a view from the street of the texas school book depository all in line with the official version of events
pigeons by the hundreds suddenly shoot off the roof
then the screen goes gray as did cbs tvs first bulletins to the country
full screen we interrupt this program to bring you this flash bulletin
a burst of gunfire
three bursts of gunfire apparently from automatic weapons were fired at president kennedys motorcade in downtown dallas
we hear voices under this from everywhere colliding in confusion and horror us all
youre going to be all right
lets get out of here
oh no theyve shot jack
i love you jack
theyve killed my husband
the first reports say that president kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting
more details just arrived
united press say the wounds to president kennedy perhaps could be fatal
repeating president kennedy has been shot by a would be assassin in dallas
three bursts of gunfire apparently from automatic weapons
blending under we hear sirens and screeching tires
the screen is still gray randomly intercut with the end of the nix film showing the car escaping
there are wildly tracking shots of the crowd running towards the grassy knoll
the camera pans up the little set of stairs
we see more faces
someone in a suit stops our camera
we see the briefest glimpse from the zapruder film
the camera moves in on the open umbrella next then to the freeway sign then to mrs
kennedy out of the car reaching for help then to the agent rushing onto the rear fender
the car finally speeds away
the people on the other side of the underpass wave at the oncoming hearse from hell
these are fragmented mystifying shots
the main effect is one of blackout of not knowing of being in the dark as we all were back then
the lovely old china clock on the wall reads
somewhere a car backfires
we see a close up of the clock moving to
we hear the sound of a pen on paper scratching

we look across the thick desk with the chess set a complete works of william shakespeare and a nazi helmet with a bullet hole in it
to jim himself writing pen to paper
we sense the quiet intellect of the year old man
the clock ticks in the awful suspended silence
its as if the air itself has been sucked from the silent room
this is the last moment of peace before the world will rush through the door in all its sound and fury to change his life forever
the camera haywires into a close up of jim as he looks up
lou ivon jims chief investigator is already standing there in the room
he is burly in his s his expression universal for that day

garrison and ivon watch the tv and then garrison stands and pays the bill
one little guy with a cheap rifle look what he can do

the tv cuts to stills of oswalds life
two newsmen sit in a studio smoking sharing information
newsman so several hours after the assassination a disturbed portrait is emerging of lee harvey oswald
described as shy and introverted he spent much of his childhood in new orleans louisiana and went to high school there
after a stint in the marines he apparently became fascinated by communism and in defected to the soviet union
newsman he married a russian woman there frank had a child and then returned to the united states after months
but he is still believed to be a dedicated marxist and a fanatical supporter of fidel castro and ultra left wing causes
he spent last summer in new orleans and was arrested in a brawl with anti castro cuban exiles
newsman and apparently bob oswald had been passing out pro castro pamphlets for an organization called fair play for cuba a communist front he reportedly belongs to
newsman and we have marina oswald his russian born wife who has identified the rifle found in the book depository as belonging to her husband
and we have
television images kennedys casket coming off the plane in washington d

on the tv we see the first image of the backyard photos of lee harvey oswald holding the rifle
these backyard photos were found yesterday among oswalds possessions in the garage of janet williams home in riving texas where marina oswald and her children are living
the picture apparently was taken earlier this year
police say the rifle a cheap world war ii italian made mannlicher carcano was ordered from a chicago mailing house and shipped to oswalds alias a
hidell at a post office box in march
this is the same rifle that was used to assassinate the president
the camera moves back to the staff who watch obviously influenced
that ties it up
jesus anybody can get a rifle in texas
hangs up so it seems that dave ferrie drove off on a friday afternoon for texas a source told kohlman he might have been a getaway pilot for oswald
members of the team exchange looks of surprise and disbelief
hold your horses

grins the anonymous kind chief
i think i remember this guy ferrie speaking at a meeting of some veterans group
ranting against castro
we go back now to the basement of police headquarters where theyre about to transfer oswald to county prison
television image the basement of the dallas police headquarters waiting

theres a pause
he is deeply disturbed
quietly well lets get ferrie in here anyway
the portable television plays to jim alone sitting in his chair smoking a pipe
we see searing images of the funeral crowds of mourners the casket being driven through the streets the honor guards the horses the dignitaries walking behind jackie veiled
the faces of de gaulle macmillan robert kennedy
we intercut briefly to lyndon johnson sitting down earlier that day with the joint chiefs of staff
and then a future cut to johnson in the oval office staged
the shots are very tight uncomfortable noses eyes hands very tight
as the door opens following a knock david ferrie is brought into jims office by two police officers and lou ivon
jim stands up cordial
ferrie suffers from alopecia a disease that has removed all his body hair and he looks like a halloween character penciled eyebrows one higher than the other a scruffy reddish
wig pasted on askew with glue thrift store clothing
his eyes however are swift and cunning his smile warm inviting itself his demeanor hungry to please
shakes hands come in dave

dave as you know president kennedy was assassinated on friday
a man named lee harvey oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named jack ruby
on each name watching ferries reaction weve heard reports that oswald spent the summer in new orleans and weve been advised you knew oswald pretty well
thats not true
i never met anybody named oswald
anybody who told you that has to be crazy
but you are aware he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager
if he did i dont remember him
there were lots of kids in and out
hands him a current newspaper im sure youve seen this
perhaps you knew this man under another name
no i never saw him before in my life
well that mustve been mistaken information we got
thanks for straightening it out for us
puffs on pipe ferrie looks relieved images of the funeral continue on the tv there is one other matter thats come up dave
we were told you took a trip to texas shortly after the assassination of friday
yeah now thats true
i drove to houston
what was so appealing about houston
i hadnt been there ice skating in many years and i had a couple of young friends with me and we decided we wanted to go ice skating
dave may i ask why the urge to go ice skating in texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory
oh it was just a spur of the moment thing
the storm wasnt that bad
and where did you drive
we went straight to houston and then saturday night we drove to galveston and stayed over there
no particular reason
just to go somewhere
and then sunday
in the morning we went goose hunting
then headed home but i dropped the boys off to see some relatives and i stayed in hammond
did you bag any geese on this trip
i believe the boys got a couple
but the boys told us they didnt get any
fidgeting lighting another cigarette oh yes well come to think of it theyre right
we got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them
but you couldnt approach them
they were a wise bunch of birds
your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car
dave isnt it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun
yes now i remember mr
im sorry i got confused
we got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized wed forgotten our shotguns
so of course we didnt get any geese
stands up dave thank you for your time
im sorry it has to end inconveniently for you but im going to have you detained for further questioning by the fbi
dave i find your story simply not believable

ferrie knew lee harvey oswald or that he has had any connection with the assassination of president kennedy
the special agent in charge would like to make clear that mr
ferrie was brought in for questioning by the district attorney of orleans parish not by the federal bureau of investigation
the bureau regrets any trouble this may have caused mr
in national news president johnson has announced the creation of a blue ribbon presidential commission to probe the events in dallas
lou looks at jim angry
correct me if im wrong
i thought we were on the same side
what the hell business is it of theirs to say that
pretty fast wasnt it
the way they let him go
they must know something we dont
dismisses it so lets get on with our lives gentlemen
we got plenty of home grown crimes to prosecute
he reaches to turn off the tv and get back to work
the last image on the tv is the commission will be headed by chief justice of the united states supreme court earl warren and is expected to head off several
congressional and texas inquiries into the assassination
on the panel are allen dulles ex chief of the cia representative gerald ford john j
mccloy former head of chase manhattan bank
jim flicks the tv off as the overture ends
we look down at the white house from the planes point of view
a subtitle reads three years later
looking out the window thats a mess down there jim
weve bitten off more vietnam that we can possibly chew
jim now reads the front page of the washington post which details the latest battle in vietnam
he sits next to senator long from louisiana in his s whos drinking a whiskey
theyre on a crowded businessmans shuttle
we see a close up of a newspaper article about the vietnam war more troops asked by westmoreland
continuing sad thing is the way its screwing up this country all these hippies running around on drugs the way young people look you cant tell a boy from a
i saw a girl the other day she was pregnant you could see her whole belly and you know what she painted on it
its fuckin outa control
valuesve gone to hell jim
course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat johnson in the white house
i sometimes feel thingsve gone downhill since john kennedy was killed senator
dont get me started on that
those warren commission fellows were pickin gnat shit out of pepper
no ones gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore
here you go senator long
the stewardess brings more drinks
surprised i thought the fbi test fired the rifle to make sure it could be done
sure three experts and not one of them could do it
theyre telling us oswald got off three shots with world class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds and accordin to his marine buddies he
got maggies drawers he wasnt any good
average man would be lucky to get two shots off and i tell ya the first shot would always be the best
here the third shots perfect
dont make sense
and then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits kennedy and connally seven times
one pristine bullet
that dog dont hunt
you know something always bothered me about that from day one and i cant put my finger on it
if i were investigatin id round up the best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in dallas that day
you been duck hunting
i think oswald was a good old fashioned decoy
whatd he say
im just a patsy
out of the mouth of babes yask me
you think there were other men involved russell
russell looks at jim quizzically and laughs
hell youre the district attorney
you read the warren report and then you tell me youre satisfied lee oswald shot the president all by his lonesome
russell honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire
i just cant believe the chief justice of the united states would put his name on something that wasnt true
to the stewardess honey another one of these
this ones as weak as cricket pee pee
yessir you mark my words jim vietnams gonna cost johnson and its gonna put that other varmint nixon in then watch your hide cause there aint no offramps on a
freeway to hell
the study is lined with bookshelves up to the ceiling we see photos of family a chess set
jim smoking his pipe reads in a red leather chair from one of the thick warren commission volumes piled all over the place
jasper now draws on a piece of paper on the floor at jims feet
jim dinners just about ready
ive got a surprise for you
tried something new
lost in thought mmmmm
sure smells good
but egghead do you realize oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination with no lawyer present and nobody recorded a word of it
i cant believe it
a police captain with years experience and a crowd of federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that oswald said would be inadmissible in court
come on now well talk about it at the table dinners getting cold
to jasper what are you doing in here
daddy said it was all right if i was real quiet
rising to dinner sure it is
freckle face if i ever handled a minor felon like that itd be all over the papers
id catch hell
and this is the alleged murderer of the president
two year old elizabeth watches crusader rabbit on tv as the new one year old sits in diapers with liz at one end of the dinner table
jim sits at the other end
there are five kids now ages and
and mattie the housekeeper
dinners finished they pass plates the children horse around
the boxer dog touchdown begs for a piece of the action
jim not a big eater feeds him ice cream
again and again they ignore credible testimony leads are never followed up its conclusions are selective theres no index its one of the sloppiest most disorganized investigations ive ever seen
dozens and dozens of witnesses in dealey plaza that day are saying they heard shots coming from the grassy knoll area in front of kennedy and not the book depository
behind him but its all broken down and spread around and you read it and the point gets lost
i never did believe it either
politely listening uh huh
mattie ill do the dishes you take be up now
and elizabeth too your bedtime honey
i dont wanna go to bed
honey that was three years ago we all tried so hard to put that out of our minds why are you digging it up again
youre the d
of new orleans
isnt the kennedy assassination a bit outside your domain
i mean all those important people already studied it
i cant believe a man as intelligent as earl warren ever read whats in those volumes
well maybe youre right jim
ill give you one hour to solve the case
until the kids are in bed
rising she puts her arms around him from behind and kisses his ear then youre mine and mr
kennedy can wait til morning
come on everybody say goodnight to daddy
showing his drawing dad look what i drew
rising thats something jasper
what is it
can i stay up another hour
virginia and snapper each get one of jims shoes as he dances with them holding one with each hand
dancing pickle and snapper my two favorite dancing partners
as the children dance they fall off jims feet laughing and giggling
he throws each in the air and kisses them
goodnight my doodle bugs
liz comes over smiling
jim takes her in his arms
one hour yhear
some saturday night date you are
sighs mama warned me this would happen if i married such a serious man
oh she did huh
when i come up ill show you how saturday night got invented
the clock on mantelpiece reads a
jim is alone smoking his pipe
in the stillness his mind crawls all over the place
the camera closes on the thickly worded pages of the warren report
flashback to the warren commission hearing room in dallas
we hear thin echoey sound as the attorneys question some of the witnesses
the overall effect is vague and confusing as is much of the warren report
ball is questioning lee bowers the switchman in the railroad yard
bowers in his early s has a trustworthy working man face and a crew cut
i sealed off the area and i held off the trains until they could be examined and there was some transients taken on at least one train
is there anything else you told me i havent asked you about that you can think of
nothing that i can recall
witness is excused
jim upset reads on
another witness sgt
harkness of the dallas police responds to a second attorney
well we got a long freight that was in there and we pulled some people off of there and took them to the station
we see another flashback to the dallas rail yards on the day of the assassination
three hoboes are being pulled off the freight by the dallas policemen
you mean some transients
tramps and hoboes
were all those questioned
flashback to dealey plaza an hour or less after the assassination
the three hoboes are marched by shotgun toting policemen to the sheriffs office at dealey plaza
we note that they do not look much like hoboes
yes sir they were taken to the station and questioned
writes incomplete switching subjects i want to go back to this amos euins
voices dribble off yes sir traffic had been cut off into the area since about but there were three cars came in during this time from around noon till the
time of the shooting
the cars circled the parking lot and left like they were checking the area one of the drivers seemed to have something he was holding to his mouth
the last car came in about to minutes before the shooting a white chevrolet door impala muddy up to the windows
the cameras point of view is now from the railroad tower near dealey plaza
we are fourteen feet off the ground overlooking the parking lot behind the grassy knoll
the shot includes this last car circling in the lot
towards the underpass i saw two men standing behind a picket fence
they were looking up towards main and houston and following the caravan as it came down
one of them was middle aged heavyset
the other man was younger wearing a plaid shirt and jacket
inside the railroad tower bowers glances out busy with the main board flashing lights a train coming in
there were two other men on the eastern end of the parking lot
each of me had uniforms
we see the parking lot from bowers point of view at a distance but we have a sense of the cars and see the men at a distance tow uniformed
the parking lot is bumper to bumper with a sea of cars
rain that morning has muddied the lot
these brief images are elaborated on later
at the time of the shooting there seemed to be some commotion
i just am unable to describe a flash of light or smoke or something which caused me to feel that something out of the ordinary had occurred there on the
we feel the growing intensity music drums but all blurred
we see a puff of smoke but no sound because of the window bowers is glancing through
a motorcycle cop shoots up the grassy knoll incline
people run blurring into a larger mosaic of confusion
bowers is confused seeing this
intercut with jims heart pounding as he reads
back in dealey plaza s
holland an elderly signal supervisor stands on the parapet of the railway
a puff of smoke came from the trees
behind that picket fence
close to the little plaza theres no doubt whatever in my mind
we see the scene from hollands point of view the puff of smoke lingering under the trees along the picket fence after the shooting
jim is asleep having a tortured dream
dreamscape flashback we see the zapruder film in slow motion and j
s face just before he goes behind stemmons freeway sign
jim sits up suddenly
liz stirs shaken
honey you all right
looks at watch its incredible honey the whole thing
a lieutenant colonel testifies that lee oswald was given a russian language exam as part of his marine training only a few months before he defects to the soviet union
a russian exam
sitting up angered i cannot believe this
its four thirty jim garrison
i have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and
honey in all my years in the service i never knew a single man who was given a russian test
oswald was a radar operator
hed have about as much use for russian as a cat has for pajamas
these books are getting to your mind mr
i wish youd stop readin them
and then this colonel tries to make it sound like nothing
oswald did badly on the test he says
he only had two more russian words right than wrong
thats like me saying touchdown here
points to the dog is not very intelligent because i beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess
gives up jim what is going on for heavens sake
you going to stay up all night every night
so youll be the only man in america who read the entire volumes of the warren report
liz do i have to spell it out for you
lee oswald was no ordinary soldier
that was no accident he was in russia
he was probably in military intelligence
thats why he was trained in russian
with a quizzical look honey go back to sleep please
i been sleeping for three years
she takes him now gently and pulls him down on top of her and kisses him
will you stop rattling on about kennedy for a few minutes honey
a sunday early
we see a statue of ben franklin in an empty square frequented by drunks who doze on benches in a little leafy park in the center of the square
the camera moves to jim by himself and then moves to a sedan pulling up which disgorges lou ivon and bill broussard
ready for a walking tour
at sunday morning
its not exactly fresh blood were sniffing here boss
points old stains bill but just as telling
time cut to jim indicating lafayette street a seedy faded three story building across the street from the square
remember whose office this was back in
yeah guy banister
ex fbi man
he died couple years ago
flashback to the exterior of the banister office on a day in
the door is now clearly labelled w
guy banister inc
it opens and banister comes out in slow motion neatly dressed rose in his lapel the same office and same man we saw three years before when he pistol whipped
banister seems to be smiling right at us greeting us
headed the chicago office
when he retired he became a private eye here
i used to have lunch with him
john birch society minutemen slightly to the right of attila the hun
used to recruit college students to infiltrate radical organizations on campus
all out of this office
now come around here take a look at this
back to the lafayette square of
jim walks ivon and bill to the corner to another entrance to the same building this one with a sign that says camp street
same building as lafayette right
but different address and different entrances both going to the same place the offices on the second and third floors
bill studies the present sign crescent city dental laboratory and gives jim a puzzled look
guess who used this address
lou gets it and glances up
we flashback to the exterior of camp street in
lee oswald comes out the door into a full close up now clearly seen by us and heads out into the street as guy banister intercepts him on the sidewalk
holding a leaflet and point to camp street stamped on it
guy seems miffed at oswald tells him something quickly and then moves on
under see this
what the hell is this doing on this piece of paper
he moves away asshole
lee harvey oswald
how do we know he was here
cause this office address was stamped on the pro casto leaflets he was handing out in the summer of down on canal street
they were the same leaflets that were found in his garage in dallas
flashback to canal street in new orleans on a summer day in
oswald in a thin tie and white short sleeved shirt and wearing a homemade placard reading hands off cuba viva fidel
is hawking leaflets to pedestrians with two young helpers
a large white haired businessman in a white suit very distinguished walks with a friend on canal street
oswald glances at him and meets his eyes
the businessman enters an office building
this man is clay bertrand later known as clay shaw
some cubans led by carols bringuier now appear
one of them the bull is heavy set with dark glasses
more of him will also be seen
he was arrested that day for fighting with some anti castro cubans
but actually he had contacted them a few days earlier as an ex marine trying to join the anti castro crusade
when they heard he was now pro castro they paid him a visit
haranguing passerby hes a traitor this man
dont believe a word he tells you
to oswald you sonofabitch you liar youre a communist go back to moscow
carlos throws oswalds leaflets in the air and pulls off his glasses prepared to fight
oswald only smiles and puts his arms down in an x of passivity
okay carlos if you want to hit me hit me
there is no real fight but the police as if pre alerted arrive
arrests are made
we see oswald in a room in the police station talking with fbi agent john quigley
a calendar on the wall shows that its august
there was no real fight and the arresting lieutenant later said he felt it was a staged incident
in jail oswald asked to talk to special agent john quigley of the fbi who showed up immediately
they have a private session
oswald is released and quigley destroys his notes from the interview
in a television studio in oswald debates carlos bringuier with two moderators
but the arrest gets him a lot of publicity and as a result oswald appears on a local tv debate that established his credentials as a communist
but youre a communist are you not and you defected to russia
no i am not a communist
but i am a marxist leninist
what did you do when you were in russia
defensive i worked while i was there
i was always under the protection of
that is to say i was not under the protection of the u
back in jim walks with his two assistants
what the hells a communist like lee oswald doing working out of banisters
yever heard of a double agent bill
im beginning to doubt oswald was ever a communist
after the arrest camp street never appeared on the pamphlets again
now heres another one for you what would you say if i told you lee oswald had been trained in the russian language when he was a marine
id say he was probably getting intelligence training
lou you were in the marines
who would be running that training
the office of naval intelligence
take a look across the street
we see the post office building across the street
in that was the office of naval intelligence and just by coincidence banister before he was fbi was oni
what do they say
once oni always oni
well he likes to work near his old pals
jim makes a gesture encompassing the whole square
bill lou were standing in the heart of the united states governments intelligence community in new orleans
thats the fbi there the cia secret service oni
doesnt this seem to you a rather strange place for a communist to spend his spare time
what are you driving at boss
were going back into the case lou the murder of the president
i want you to take some money from the fees and fines account and go to dallas talk to some people
bill i want you to get oser on the medical the autopsy susan on oswald and ruby histories tax records
lord wake me please
i must be dreaming
no youre awake bill and im dead serious
and were going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago
how did you find out dave ferrie drove to texas that day
a straggly group of people watch from the grandstands eating hotdogs and talking in small clusters
the horses are running early morning laps
three men sit apart in the bleachers
a scared jack martin three years older than when last seen still wearing the dick tracy hat sucks up coffee like a worm does moisture
he has the red puffy cheeks of an alcoholic and deeply circled worried eyes
bill and jim wait
youre not under cross examination here jack
what i need is a little clarification about the night guy banister beat you over the head with his magnum
you called our office hopping mad from your hospital bed
dont tell me you dont remember that
jack looks away and doesnt respond
heres my problem jack
you told me you and guy were good friends for a long time
more than ten years
and he never hit you before
never touched me
yet on november the day of the presidents murder our police report says he pistol whipped you with a
martins eyes are fixed on jim but the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill
here take a look at it
martin looks at the report now does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you
sudden flashback to the night of the pistol whipping
the camera shows banister laying martins head open the beating the humiliation
shaking his head slowly dreamily no it involved more than that
bill looks at jim
how much more
waits i dont know if i should talk about this
well id ask guy we were friendly you know heart attack wasnt it
if you buy what you read in the paper
you have other information
i didnt say that
all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out
why did guy beat you jack
well i guess now that guys dead it dont really matter
it was about the people hanging around the office that summer
i wasnt really part of the operation you know
i was handling the private eye work for guy when that came in not much did but thats why i was there
it was a nuthouse
there were all these cubans coming and going
they all looked alike to me
flashback to banisters office in
there are cubans in battle fatigues and combat boots duffle bags are lying around
david ferrie in fatigues directs the cubans as they carry crates of ammunition and weapons into a back room
martin observes from another desk
dave ferrie you know about him
was he there often
he practically lived there
it was real cloak and dagger stuff
they called it operation mongoose
the idea was to train all these cuban exiles for another invasion of cuba
banisters office was part of a supply line that ran from dallas through new orleans to miami stockpiling arms and explosives
still in we see the exterior of banisters office
a dozen cubans follow ferrie downstairs into the street and pile into several cars duffels thrown in with them
ferrie drives the lead car
all this right under the noses of the intelligence community in lafayette square
we see the cars cross the long lake pontchartrain bridge and enter a remote guerrilla training camp
bayou and jungle are all around
everybody knew everybody
it was a network
they were working for the cia pilots black operations guys civilians military everybody in those days was running guns somewhere
fort jefferson bayou bluff morgan city
mcallen texas was a big gun running operation
at the guerrilla training camp at lake pontchartrain in we see scenes of basic training shooting obstacle courses callisthenics led by ferrie and other trainers
scattered among the cubans are several white american mercenaries
we catch a glimpse of oswald and glimpses of several other men we will see again in sprinklings
where is banister in all this
banister was running his camp north of lake pontchartrain
ferrie handled a lot of the training
there was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in cuba
a few americans got trained too
but ferrie was the craziest
its night at the training camp
fbi agents race up in cars in the middle of the night swarming over the camp rounding up the trainees
anyway late summer the party ended
kennedy didnt want another bay of pigs mess so he ordered the fbi to shut down the camps and confiscate the napalm and the c
there were a buncha cubans and a couple americans arrested only you didnt read about it in the papers
just the weapons got mentioned
cause the first ones behind bars wouldve been banister and ferrie but i think the g men were just going through the motions for washington
their hearts were with their old fbi buddy banister
we see fbi agents loading dynamite bomb casings arms mm artillery shells etc
back at the racetrack in jim listens
like i said a fuckin nuthouse
we hear the rhythmic beating of the horse hooves and martin sucking on the steaming cup of coffee
finally yeah he was there too
sometimes hed be meeting with banister with the door shut
other times hed be shooting the bull with ferrie
but he was there all right
anything more specific jack
flashback to banisters office in
banister and martin shooting the breeze as the straight laced middle aged secretary delphine roberts hurries in
yeah one time the secretary got upset i remember
i cant believe it mr
lee oswald is down on canal street giving out communist leaflets supporting castro
banister just looks at her and laughs
its okay delphine hes with us
back at the racetrack
anyone else involved at banisters level
shrugs there was one guy i dont know big guy business guy white hair i saw him come into the office once
he looked out of place yknow like a society guy
cant remember his name
thinking oswald was with him
flashback to banisters office on a day in
martin is snooping in banisters files
cut to martin leaving the office as a big businessman with white hair briefly talks to oswald and then goes into banisters private office
he had something to do with money
i remember him cause guy who didnt kiss anybodys ass sure kissed his
banister lets the man into his private office
clay something that was his name clay
pause paranoid i dont know
maybe it wasnt
i gotta go
to bill clay bertrand
hes in the warren report
he tried to get oswald a lawyer
to martin was kennedy ever discussed jack
course they hated the sonofabitch but
the assassination jack
not with me sir never
listen i think id better go
i said enough
i said all im going to say
rises suddenly hold on jack
whats the problem
whats the problem
whats the problem
do i need to spell it out for you mr
i better go
nobody knows what were talking about jack
youre so naive mister
martin picks his way nervously down the bleacher benches
jim drives with numa in the front and bill in the back
well its a terrific yard chief but the mans an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss
does that bother you bill
i always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute she has to have bad eyesight
hell never sign a statement boss let alone get on a witness stand
when somethings rotten in the land bill it generally isnt just one fish well get corroboration
find this clay bertrand
if i were a betting man id give you to its an alias
start checking around the quarter
and the six of us with almost no budget and in secret are going to solve the case that the warren commission with dozens of support staff and millions of
dollars couldnt solve
we cant keep up with the crimes in the parish as it is chief
the murder of a president bill is a crime in orleans parish too
i didnt pick you because of your legal skill you know
gee thanks boss
jim pulls the car over to park
but because youre a fighter
i like a man who isnt scared of bad odds
jim and the others get out of the car and head towards antoines restaurant
a black woman greets him
how ya doing mr
remember me from the piano bar at the royal orleans
i sure do
we sang youre the cream in my coffee
others move in on him
to numa make sure we come back here now
they enter a busy lunchtime crowd in an elegant eatery
lou ivon and al oser are waiting for them as theyre shown to their table by the maitre d
garrison we have not seen enough of you lately
been too busy paul an elected man cant have as much fun as he used to
seeing lou and al welcome back lou
find out anything on those hobos
lous been waiting excited
he gives jim blowups of the five hobo photographs
they took em to the sheriffs office not the police station and they let em go
no record of them ever being questioned
i cant say that comes as a surprise anymore
a photographer from the dallas times herald got some great shots of them never published
the camera moves in on the photographs
flashback to the hoboes being escorted to the sheriffs office as per sgt
harkness earlier description
take a good look chief do any of em look like the hoboes you remember
hoboes i knew of old used to sleep in their clothes these two look pretty young
not a single frayed collar or cuff new haircuts fresh shaves clean hands new shoe leather
look at the ear of the cop
thats a wire
whats a cop wearing a headset for
i think theyre actors chief theyre not cops
susie cox arrives
who the hell are they then
hi susie sit down
to lou this could be it
lets start looking for em
how bout that railroad man lee bowers
saw those men at the picket fence
august this year
jim curses quietly a single car accident on an empty road in midlothian texas
the doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died
pause shares the look we need to find more witnesses lou
there was rose cheramie
two cubans threw her out of a car on the way to dallas
she talked to a cop from a hospital bed two days before the assassination said kennedy would be hit that friday
she said she was a dope runner for jack ruby and that ruby knew oswald for years
can we find her
graveyard dead near big sandy texas in
two in the morning on some highway
a hit and run
flashback to rose lying dead on an empty highway
why not go right to the horses mouth chief
jack rubys been rotting in a dallas jail cell for three years
maybe hes ready to crack
if we go to him our investigationll hit the front pages by sunrise
blow up right in our face
ruby was just given a new trial
if he has something to say itll be there
susie what did you find out on oswald
negative on his tax records
first time i know a d
cant get a tax record
i put together a list of all the cia files on oswald that were part of the warren report and asked for them
there are about documents
gives it to jim who reads oswald in the ussr in mexico city oswald and the u a cia personnel file a memo from the director on oswald travel and
activities cant get one of them
all classified as secret on the grounds of national security
its real strange
maybe theres more to this susie
the cias keeping something from our enemies
yes but were talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance
three years later and hes still classified
they gave us his grammar school records a study of his pubic hairs
put it in context bill of what we know about oswald
lonely kid no father unstable childhood high school dropout wants to grow up and be a spy joins the marines at
he learns russian he acts overtly marxist with two other marines but hes stationed at a top secret base in japan where u spy flights over russia originate
hes discharged from the marines supposedly because his mothers sick
he stays home days then with a ticket from a bank account he goes to moscow
flashback to moscow in
we see shots of the city strange and eerie black and white stills
inside the u
embassy oswald slaps his passport on the table with a formal letter
two consuls attend him
voice stilted i want to renounce my citizenship and become a soviet citizen
im going to make known to them all information i have concerning the marine corps and my specialty therein radar operation
one of the consuls john mcvickar says oswalds performance was not spontaneous it seemed coached
oswald gives an interview to a journalist
continuing the moscow flashback we see oswald talking with a female journalist in his small room in the hotel metropole
again he sounds robotic
i will never return to the united states for any reason
it is a capitalist country an exploitive racist country
i am a marxist since i was
ive seen poor niggers and that was a real lesson
people hate because theyre told to hate like school kids
its the fashion to hate people in the u
the russians are skeptical want to send him back
maybe they suspect hes a spy
he supposedly slashes his wrists in a suicide attempt so that theyre forced to keep him and he disappears for six weeks presumably with the kgb
we see photos of the city of minks in russia oswald with various friends and tourists shots of lee and marina with a new baby
finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has hes given rubles a roomy apartment with a
balcony has affairs with local girls
makes sense hes a spokesman
but he never writes speaks or does any propaganda for the russians
he meets marina whose uncle is a colonel in soviet intelligence at a trade union dance she thinks hes russian the way he speaks six weeks later they marry have
didnt someone say he didnt speak good russian
its a contradiction numa get used to them
the only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets
or fake secrets
we see documentary shots of the u on russian soil
francis gary powers
the summit conference canceled
eisenhower and khrushchev
i dont know if its coincidence but oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the u program from his days at atsugi air base in japan
six months after he arrives in russia francis gary powers u spy flight goes down in russia
that plane was untouchable
powers hinted that oswald couldve given the russians enough data to hit it
as a direct result the peace summit between khrushchev and eisenhower failed
i cant help thinking of that book seven days in may maybe someone in our military didnt want the peace conference to happen maybe oswald was part of that
it gets weirder
susie youre an assistant d
stick to what you can prove in court
you want facts bill
from to only two u
soldiers defect to russia
from to seven defect six return one of them another marine a month before oswald
all of them young men made to seem poor disenchanted
dont get sidetracked
how does he get back to the states
thats the point
does he have any problems
the state department issues him a new passport in hours and loans him the money to travel
hes never investigated or charged by the navy for revealing classified information or as far as we know debriefed by the cia
this is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the pacific
he shouldve been prosecuted as a traitor
the fbi finally gets around to talking to him in dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant communist type
but who meets him when he gets off the boat in new york in june
the screen shows photos of new york empty docks
a ship coming in
wall street on a sunday morning graphic weegee type black and white stills then a photo of spas t
raikin a leading member of an anti communist group
does she have a problem getting out
its next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out
nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in
a man who has defected once already
dammit it doesnt add up
ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations
the state department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to minks to insure oswalds return
only intelligence people can come and go like that
flashback to a forth worth map factory
we see oswald at work on photo mattes with a minox spy camera
the camera shows close ups of maps and then flashes to a hand in the photographic section
we see a close up of oswalds head in a photograph the same headshot that will be superimposed on the oswald photo and a razor blade cutting mattes
the next thing we know hes living in dallas ft
worth in october working months at jaggars chiles stovall a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the u
he starts work only days before the government reveals russian missiles in cuba and the crisis explodes
oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the u planes and works alongside a young man whod been in the army security agency
sort of like benedict arnold coming back to george washingtons cabinet
equally incongruous is oswald becoming chummy with the white russian community of dallas all rabid anti communists
flashback to fort worth in
in oswalds cheap apartment seven white russians including george de mohrenschildt a distinguished grey haired man in his late fifties are visiting marina and oswald bringing old dresses groceries and
toys and milk for the crying baby whose cradle is two suitcases
his closest friend is an oilman named george de mohrenschildt whos about years older than oswald whos only and supposedly broke
de mohrenschildt is a member of the dallas petroleum club speaks five languages and was in french vichy intelligence during the war
also rumoured to have been a nazi sympathizer and member of the solidarists an international anti communist organization with many eastern europeans and ex nazis many of them brought here
by the cia after the war many of them involved in oil and munitions interests in dallas and the southwest
you figure it
whered you get all this nazi stuff
hands him a file read it
they called it project paperclip
this is the guy that keeps turning up in colonial countries and each time something strange happens
coup detats presidents overthrown
he shows up on a walking tour of guatemalas cuban invasion camps just before the bay of pigs invasion
if we dont know hes cia lets circle him very probable oswalds handler
we see oswald and de mohrenschildt talking with the others and a magazine cover with j
the subject of discussion
i think hes made some mistakes on cuba but hes doing a pretty good job
if he succeeds in my opinion hell be a great president
and a really attractive one too open features great head of hair
laughs de mohrenschildt draws a picture of oswald as an intellectual well read speaks excellent russian a man who adored j
dont get sidetracked
this is the man bottom line who nailed oswald to the warren commission as a potentially violent man and linked him to the rifle
time cut to oswalds apartment on a different day in
george de mohrenschildt points out a mannlicher carcano rifle in the closet turns to lee
so lee what are you taking a potshot at this week rabbits or fascists
lees look is sickly
he freezes up
resume scene of white russian gathering in oswalds apartment
the only russian that suspects oswald of still being a communist is anna meller
but her russian friend tells her hes checked with the local fbi and was told oswald is all right
anna meller one of the guests glances at a copy of das kapital in a pile of books and talks to another russian man about it
talking now to lee and marina are janet and bill williams a mid american couple in their late twenties freshly minted
the oswalds are introduced by george de mohrenschildt to janet and bill williams
its through janet williams in october that lee gets the warehouse job right smack on elm street at the book depository which is owned by another oilman with ties to
defense and military intelligence
presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at
we see oswald and another man in the texas school book depository in
they are hauling and stacking school textbooks an obviously lower level job for oswald after the map factory
we cut ahead to empty graphics of the sealed off area the window site the cafeteria
all i can find out about the williams is their tax returns are classified and that bill williams a descendant of the cabots of massachusetts has links through his family
and united fruit to the cia and does classified work for bell helicopter which requires a security clearance so what is oswald a defector doing visiting his wife in his house
williams has a relationship at bell with general walter dornberger another one of the nazis we brought in after the war for our missile program
he used slave labor to build the v rockets for hitler before bell needed him
i wonder about the williams
just where did the first description of oswald come from at
no one knows
they claimed it was brennans but his description came after p
somehow the fbis been tapping the williams and picks up a call between bell helicopter and janets phone an unidentified voice saying we both know whos responsible
whys the bureau been tapping them
we see the interior of the williams home in irving on a day in
his wife janet williams studied russian in college and her father worked for the agency for international development which works hand in hand with the cia
she suddenly becomes marinas best friend
marina fights often with lee about many things his secrecy the lack of money
she says lee is not sexually adequate
lee hits her on several occasions
bill williams convenient separation from janet allows janet to invite marina to move into her house in irving
there marina and lee have a second daughter while lee now stores his belongings in janets garage and rents a small room in dallas under an alias of o
we see marina and oswald in bed at night in the williams house in a tender scene
oswald says goodbye to his child
time cut to oswald living in a boarding house
it is at night and he sits in his room alone
the housekeeper earlene roberts heavyset white in her s comes in and asks him if he wants to watch some tv with her
when hes arrested marina buries him with the public
her description of him is that of a psychotic and violent man
flashback to marina on tv a different person from before
i do not want to believe but i have too much facts
tell me that lee shot kennedy
yeah after they take her to six flags inn in arlington prepare her for the interviews teach her how she should answer and after two months and interviews she has
a nervous breakdown
flashback oswald was no angel thats clear but who was he
back to antoines restaurant
im lost boss
what are we saying here
were saying that when oswald went to russia he was not a real defector that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he
remained one till the day he died thats what were saying
and therefore because oswald pulled the trigger the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief
thats what youre saying
ill go you one better
maybe oswald didnt even pull the trigger bill
the nitrate test indicates he didnt even fire a rifle on november nd
and on top of that they didnt even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day
he had his palm print on the weapon
it went to the goddamn fbi and they didnt find a goddamn thing
it comes back a week later and one guy in the dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all i know he couldve taken off oswald at
theres no chain of evidence bill
and what about the tow guns actually seen in the depository
one an enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a mauser described by deputy weitzman
maybe just maybe lee oswald was exactly what he said he was bill a patsy
take it at face value
lou susie im going with my gut here
hes got an alias of hidell to buy the rifle o
lee to rent the room right
whats in a name right
in intelligence theyre assumed to be fake
a name is sort of like a postbox number a code several different people can use the same name right
then why cant somebody be using oswalds name
we see blank faces around the table
to frame him obviously
you got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think bill
theyre not ordinary crooks
i never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in texas give a phony name
and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced
unless he or someone else wants him to get caught
maybe he never ordered the weapon lou
somebody else did
it was picked up at the post office early morning when oswalds time sheet shows him clocked in at his job
lou come alive
these things are not adding up
i still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this boss
susies stuff is colorful but
lets start making some assumptions about the man
why would he leave a path as big as lee harvey oswalds
this is not a thin trail gentlemen it is a very wide one
who found the evidence
who set him up
lou bill susie i want you to go back and check all the sightings of oswald in dallas new orleans and mexico in the summer and fall of see if
its the same guy
boss oswald impersonators
sounds like james bond now
al you cant tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close
if we dont start reading between the lines here
yall gotta start thinking on a different level like the cia does
were through the looking glass
here white is black and black is white
what do you think lou
im just an investigator bill
i leave the theories to you lawyers
a week ago i wouldve said this is nuts but now
shakes his head theres a lot of smoke there but theres some fire
now you guys come on
youre talking about the united states government here
were talking about a crime bill
no one is above the law
a crime was committed
lets get to work
jack ruby thick fudge of an angry face flu ridden confronts a doctor and two guards in his cell
christ what the hell kinda needle is that
i just got a cold for chrissake
i dont want any shot
please relax mr
thisll calm you down and clear this up
doc im telling you i dont need any shots
ruby i dont want to involve the guards
itll just take a few seconds
ruby looks over at the two guards who eye him
the doctor gives him the injection
flashback to rubys jail cell in
ruby talks to men with their backs to us
lawyers and police clutter the cell making ruby hyper nervous
the chief officials white hair and avuncular voice are all we see and hear of him his back is to us
then do you understand that i cannot tell the truth here
that there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth
who do not want me to have a retrial
ruby i really cant see why you cant tell us now
ruby catches the stern face of sheriff bill decker from the corner of his eye the assistant d
next to him
when are you going back to washington sir
looks at watch i am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing i am going to have some lunch
can i make a statement
if you request me to go back to washington with you right now that is if you want to hear further testimony from me can you do that
can you take me with you
no that could not be done mr
there are a good many things involved in that
what are they
well the public attention it would attract
and we have no place for you there to be safe were not law enforcement officials and many things are at stake in this affair mr
but if i am eliminated there wont be any way of knowing
consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country and i know i wont live to see you another time
my life is in danger here
do i sound screwy
well i dont know what can be done mr
ruby because i dont know what you anticipate we will encounter
then you dont stand a chance mr
chief justice you have a lost cause
all i want is a lie detector test and you refuse to give it to me
because as it stands now and the truth serum how do you pronounce it pentothal whatever it is
they will not give it to me because i want to tell the truth
and then i want to leave this world
the camera pauses on rubys face
the men rise and leave in the shadows
jack ruby is escorted out of the infirmary dead of cancer
the puffy smiling face of dean andrews framed by huge black glasses talks in a louisiana hippie argot of the s
the restaurant has a fancy french decor mirrored walls marble it serves the cream of louisiana society
why you keep dancing on my head for my man
we been thickern molasses pie since law school
because you keep conning me dean
i read your testimony to the warren commission and
there you go
grain of salt
two sides to every coin
you tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this clay bertrand and asked to fly to dallas and be lee oswalds layer
now thats pretty important dean
you also told the fbi when you met him he was six foot two
then you tell the commission he was five foot eight
how the hell did the man shrink like that dean
they put the heat on my man just like youre doing
i gaveem anything that popped into my cabeza
truth is i never met the dude
sudden flashback to andrews office on a day in
clay bertrand sits back to us talking to andrews
he has close cropped white hair
he is the same patrician man weve seen earlier with oswald on canal street and in banisters office
andrews is evidently lying
i dont know what the cat looks like and furthermore i dont know where hes at
all i know is sometimes he sends me cases
so one day hes on the phone talkin to me about going to dallas and repping oswald
notices a woman in present hey pipe the bimbo in red
what ever happened to that little gal you was dating in the quarter from opelousas yknow elevator didnt go to the top floor but tits could smother gumbo with
jim in present looking briefly a pretty girl walking in
remembering yeah she was pretty all right but not half as cute as you deano
you shoulda tried a legitimate line of business
chuckles you cant ever say crime dont pay in louisiana jim only not as good as it used to
good chowder aint it
when did you first do business with this bertrand
bored oh i first heard these street cats jiving about him back in when i lived down in the quarter
they swish yknow
young fags you know
theyd come into my bureau needing help no bread and id say hey man i aint rockefeller who gonna back you up
these cornmuffins go to the phone and dial
flashback to andrews office on another day in
we catch a glimpse of a young swish sitting in andrews office talking on the phone
andrews is also on the phone to bertrand unseen on the other end
the dude on the other end says
im clay bertrand
whatever they owe i guarantee
hey suits me fine daddy warbucks how do i get in touch with you
and thats how i first heard of clay bertrand
what was his voice like
you knew you werent talking to some low life fag you know
he had command of the kings english
did he pay
always like tits on a pig
i wish i had a million of those bimbettes
just a slight hesitation like i told to the washington boys bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his marine discharge
so you saw oswald how many times
he came in with a few cubano swishes one time i remember
flashback to a third day at andrews office in
oswald is in the office with two young boys
recall any names
in present mario jose they wear names like you and i wear clothes
today the name is candy tomorrow its butsie
i wish i could help you jim
did you speak to oswald in dallas
knee jerk reaction hell no
i told this bertrand cat right off this isnt my scene man
i deal with muni court im a hack in nigger town that kid needs a hot dog
then how the hell did you get in the warren commission dean
except through the phone records in the dallas jail
nervous moment there were no phone records
of course there werent
cause they disappeared
and yet the commission found you dean
i dont know how they got to me
maybe cause i repped him here
the feebees run background checks
on my mamas breasts man thats all i got
pauses adjusts there wasnt no conspiracy jim
if there were why the hell didnt bobby kennedy prosecute it as attorney general he was his brother for chrissake
how the fuck three people could keep a secret like that i dont know
it was oswald
he was a nut job
faggot yknow hated this country
as andrews resumes eating his crabmeat louie with gusto jim reaches over and grabs the fork in mid air
dean i think were having a communication problem
i know you know who clay bertrand is
now stop eating that damn crabmeat for a minute and listen
gets deans attention im aware of our long friendship but i want you to know im going to call you in front of a grand jury
i took nine judges on deano right here in new orleans and i beat em all
if you lie to the grand jury as youve been lying to me im going to charge you with perjury
now am i communicating with you
andrews puts down the fork shaken silent for a moment
is this off the record daddy o
jim nods in that case let me sum it up for you real quick
if i answer that question you keep asking me if i give you the name of the big enchilada yknow then its bon voyage deano i mean like permanent
i mean like a bullet in my head
does that help you see my problem a little better
youre a mouse fighting a gorilla
kennedys dead as that crab meat
the governments still breathing
you want to line up with a dead man
at a nearby table a waiter has just poured brandy on crepe suzettes
a blue flame hovers in the air as jim leans forward across the table speaking deliberately
read my lips deano
either you dance into the grand jury with the real identity of clay bertrand or your fat behind is going to the slammer
do you dig me
andrews stands suddenly
youre just as crazy as your mama
goes to show its in the genes
do you have any idea what youre getting into my man
you think jack ruby just up and died of cancer in four weeks after he gets a retrial
thats some kinda new cancer id say thats a going out of business cancer
you got the right ta ta but the wrong ho ho
the governments gonna jump all over your head jimbo and go cock a doodledoo
andrews drops his pink napkin in the crabmeat and waddles out
jim now feels closer to the truth than ever
from the point of view of an approaching car the prison looms over the swamp dogs patrolling the wire
district attorney garrison to see prisoner ward block b
send him on in
a chief guard walks jim and bill into a circus like atmosphere
in louisiana the prisoners can wear any outfit they choose which makes this prison look like mardi gras
there are many transvestites
with evident pride we dont need no gates out there sir we got the swamp
many of em gone in there but none come out
willie okeefe a handsome muscled young chickenhawk with an earring bandana colorful clothes an aura of burned truth in his intense staring brown eyes and thick country accent sashays over
you got some company wants to talk wid you
you behave now boy yhear
timecut to the prison work area where willie talks leaning against a tree looking out on a mangrove swamp
its lunch break and other prisoners move in the background eating socializing
i want to thank you mr
okeefe for this time
call me willie
i aint got nuthin but time mr
minutes hours days years ofem
time just stands still here like a snake sunnin itself in the road
clay bertrand willie
i met him sometime in june of at the masquerade bar
dave ferrie took me there for the express reason to meet him
for sexual purposes
flashback to the masquerade bar in the french quarter
its nighttime and ferrie bertrand and okeefe sit at a back booth
bertrand as seen earlier is an imposing white haired patrician man over six feet tall heavily defined bones and eyelids in his late s or early s
did he pay you for this
twenty dollars each time
hell its no secret
thats what im here for
they rise to leave
bertrand with a slight limp
anything else unusual about him youd be able to describe in a court of law willie
i remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg
dont get me wrong hes not one of those you know limp wrists
hes a butch john
youd meet him on the street youd never snap
you could go fishing with him play poker with him youd never snap in a million years
so one night we were over at ferries place
having a party
sometime in the late summer of
flashback to dave ferries apartment on a night in
the place is filled messy bricabrac including two dozen mouse cages for ferries cancer experiments
ferrie bertrand okeefe and four cubans in battle fatigues are laughing and fooling around
oswald is in a corner cleaning a
rifle with a scope on it
he looks different unkempt unshaven
a record player grinds out a speech in spanish by castro
some other people are there as well its a beatnik scene sandals hanging out only one woman
ferrie is taking pictures throughout of the group horsing around photographing oswald
there were about nine or ten people cubans friends of dave doing some stuff in the bush with him
place was a mess
daves mind was a mess laughs yknow he had all those mice cages around cause hes working on this cure for cancer
daves smart real smart speaks five languages knows philosophy medicine military history politics
he wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him cause he was queer
and thats where you met oswald for the first time
yeah strange guy
dave introduced him as
willie say hello to leon oswald
over the racket how ya doing
sullen to ferrie what the fucks he doing here
fuck you man
ferrie separates them
oswald seems to resent an outsider being there
to okeefe leons in a bad mood dont get excited hes all right
would you say this leon was actually lee harvey oswald
in present fuck yes
hell im already in jail
i got no reason to lie to you
i aint no nigger
go on willie
present merging to past well the party got crazier and crazier one of those yknow beatnik type things
to okeefe were having a little meeting here
indicates the second player thats castro
sounds like hitler doesnt he
sonofabitch is going to go
muerte a fidel
irritated at the noise oh stop it already
what are all these people doing here anyway
i cant bear all this infernal noise
clara dont be so sensitive
i didnt come here for a pep rally
get all this riffraff out of here
timecut to later that night when only okeefe ferrie bertrand oswald and three cubans are left
finally they got out of there and i found myself alone with dave and this leon two of the cubans and this guy bertrand
dave pulled out his clippings which he was always carrying around
hed been obsessed with castro and kennedy for months and he started in again
waving a clipping drunk kennedy fucked us in and hes fuckin us now
and that fuckin zealot bobby kennedy is the fuckee
the nerve of that little asswipe closing the camps
took all our c
took ten thousand rounds pounds of gunpowder all our weapons
next well be living in a world where only the cocksucking reds will have all the weapons and well be surrounded
if we want a free cuba we gotta whack out the fucking beard
that faggot kennedy wont let us
our hands are empty how can we kill him
moving with a drink walks with a slight limp its a real problem getting at him
castros got informers on every block
pointing to a map of cuba on the wall bullshit
theres all kinds of new stuff
i heard about rockets in an umbrella theyre tested at fort detrick
i can show you a dozen poisons
stick it in his food hell die in three days no trace
we can put something in his beard make it fall out hell look fuckin ridiculous without his beard
drunk why dont we just take care of the main problem
which is that piece of shit kennedy
hes doing all kinds of deals
kissing khrushchevs ass
i wouldnt even call him president kennedy
then the cubans left and the bullshitting was going on dave was drunk really drunk and he starts in with kennedy again
see what kennedy done with him you should take a knife and stab and kill the fucker where he is now
i mean it
this is true
but i tell you something
i hope i get a weeks notice
right in the fuckin white house
somebodys got to get rid of this fucker
oswald looks up listens quietly
oh cmon dave youre never gonna get that sonofabitch
it wont be long mark my words
that fuckerll get whats coming to him
and it can be blamed on castro
then the whole countryll want to invade cuba
all we got to do is get kennedy in the open
bertrand with his arms around okeefe laughs tries to change the subject
david david always some harebrained scheme or another
what do i see here
oooooh lets have some more champagne shall we
interested in ferries proposal what about the secret service the cops
pacing hyper no problem if its planned right
look how close they got with de gaulle
eisenhower was always riding around in an open top
i know somebody who actually went up and touched eisenhower once
we need to have three mechanics at three different locations
an office building with a high powered rifle
triangulation of crossfire is the key
you get the diversionary shot gets the secret service looking one way boom
you get the kill shot
the crucial thing is one man has to be sacrificed then in the commotion of the crowd the job gets done and the others fly out of the country to
someplace with no extradition
i could do that myself
i could fly to mexico and then brazil
oswald listens playing with his rifle
bertrand suddenly turns cold flashing a look at ferrie
why dont we drop this subject
its one thing to engage in badinage with these youngsters but this sort of thing could be so easily misunderstood
he squeezes ferrie ouch
i didnt think much about it at the time
just bullshit yknow everybody likes to make themselves out to be something more than they are
specially in the homosexual underworld
but then when they got him merging to the present i got real scared yknow
and thats when i got popped
back to the prison work area
jim and okeefe continue talking
willie are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal
under the supervision of a doctor
i told you so
and you can tellem all i told you so
you realize the things youre saying willie are going to be attacked by a lot of different people
bring on all the motherfuckers
bring their college degrees in here
i got nuthin to hide
they cant buy me
you cant buy me
i dont even need the parole
this is about the truth coming out
youre a goddamn liberal mr
garrison you dont know shit cause you never been fucked in the ass
fascism is here now facism is
no ones trying to buy you willie
its important to know why youre telling us this
pauses you wanna know why
cause that mother fucker kennedy stole that fuckin election thats why
nixon was gonna be one of the great presidents til kennedy wrecked this fuckin country
got niggers all over the fuckin place asking for their rights where do you think we got all this fuckin crime now cause kennedy promised em too damned much
fascisms coming back
i tell ya this the day that communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country
i jes hate to think theyre blaming it on some silly fuckin oswald who didnt know shit anyway
people should know why that sumbitch was killed
cause he was a communist
put me on the stand go ahead ill tell the same goddamn story im proud of it dont matter fuck all to me things dont change
as he talks jim shares a sickened look with bill
whatever truth he may be telling is necessarily compromised by an attitude that could be destroyed in court
jim lou al susie and numa sit around the table having an after hours conference
the kids run in and out of the room playing
susie is doing the talking showing new paperwork and photos
your hunch was right boss but its even spookier than we thought
starting in september on two months before the assassination there are sightings of oswald all over dallas buying ammunition getting a telescopic sight fixed going to rifle ranges
early november a dallas downtown lincoln mercury dealership where he tells the salesman albert bogard
flashback to the lincoln mercury dealership
oswald is deliberately kept in half or three quarter shots a mystery figure
he kicks the tires on a used red mercury comet cocky
lets take it out for a test drive
the salesman bogard is hesitant
oswald doesnt look like hes got a dime to his name
hey i got a lotta money coming in the next two weeks
in the next scene we see the car driven by oswald zooming up the ramp and disappearing onto the freeway
despite the fact he has no license and from what marina says does not know how to drive he hits the curves like mario andretti at the indy
bogard later told his boss he drove like a madman
resume the scene at the dealership
three hundred bucks down mr
oswald you can drive outta here with it
oswald unhappy starts to leave
who you kidding
for this heap
no honest working man can afford a car anymore in the goddamn country
maybe ill have to go back to russia to buy a car
really dumb dialogue like hes trying to draw attention to himself
a real moron
he walks out
the salesman remembers him as about but we know from his draft card he was about
several witnesses see him on several separate days at different firing ranges
flashback to a dallas firing range in
one time november he decides he needs to practice on the target of the guy next to him
says something really dumb to the guy who says oswald was a great shot
hey watcha doing boy
thats my target
hey sorry buddy
i just thought it was that sonofabitch kennedy yknow
i couldnt help myself
laughs in present about as subtle as a cockroach crawling across a white rug
ill go you one better lou
he shows up at silvia odios a cuban lady in dallas working in the anti castro underground remember that name a solid witness
the two cubans introduce him as leon oswald
flashback to the corridor of silvia odios apartment in dallas on a night in
oswald drags behind two cubans one is the bull heavyset with a scar over his left eye who we saw at the canal street incident and the other the indian
is quiet and cold
the men ring the doorbell and talk to a concerned silvia as oswald hangs back watching in the shadows
the men give her intimate information about her father who is imprisoned in cuba
the men chatter ad lib in spanish
the cubans want silvia whose parents are political prisoners in cuba to help them raise money to assassinate castro
something about the men bothers her
she tells them she doesnt want anything to do with violence
about hours later one of the cubans calls her back
we see a shot of silvia on the phone in her apartment intercut with a shot of the bull in a gas station phone booth on a night in
on the phone in spanish this guy leon oswalds great hes kinda nut
he told us we dont any guts us cubans cause kennedy shouldve been whacked after the bay of pigs and some cubans shouldve done that its easy to do he
says you know hes a marine an expert shooter
silvia odio is surprised to hear this information volunteered
the bulls eyes are on oswaldo outside the booth with the indian
theyre hanging out talking to a mystery man an anglo
its like hes giving her information she doesnt even ask for
shes scared doesnt see them again till she sees oswalds picture in the paper
but the warren commission says she has bad eyesight because they have oswald in mexico at this time trying to get back into cuba
the cubans think hes a double agent so they wont take him
the cia has a camera outside the cuban embassy and says this is oswald in mexico
hands over a picture you figure it
jim looks at the famous photo
the camera closes in on a heavyset man who looks nothing like oswald
liz has come back in and overhears
if this is oswald it must be our third oswald
the interesting thing is the extent to which the warren commission went to make him a communist
they got almost pages and exhibits of the report on this mexico trip and the picture doesnt even match
im beginning to think the point of the mexican episode was to lay the blame at castros door
if oswald or someone purporting to be oswald had gotten into cuba come back then killed the president the american public once again wouldve screamed for a cuban invasion
susie picks up the famous life magazine cover shot of oswald holding a rifle in his backyard
i even have doubts about this photo boss
it pretty much convicted oswald in the public mind
well according to captain fritz oswald told him during his interrogation the photo was fake
flashback to the dallas homicide office in
oswald is being interrogated by will fritz dallas homicide chief who shows him the original of the photo from the williams garage
thats not me
it came from janet williams garage
well i never saw that picture
it is my face but my face has been super imposed the rest of the picture is not me at all
ive done a lot of photographic work and that picture was made by someone else
so who the hell are you
alex hidell or oswald
well youre the policeman you work it out
in the present oswald who worked for jaggars chiles stovall did know spy photography pretty well
i took this picture to two experts
look at the way the shadows on the nose fall in a straight line like its high noon
but the shadow here on the ground reads like late afternoon or early morning
its not the same time
also look at the crop marks across the chin
it seems like his head is pasted on somebody elses body implicating him with this rifle and gun
we see a blowup of the photo the shadows the crop mark
and of the two newspapers in his hands one is leninist the other trotskyite
any genuine socialist would know they hate each others politics
broussard walks past a jazz wake leaving the cemetery black flambeurs carry torches people sing when the saints go marching in
bill is with a local gambler type
sure i know him
he comes around the quarter
who is he joe
ive been to every bar no one wants to talk
i told your uncle i never met a lawman who wasnt a punk
you too bill even if youre family
hes a big shot businessman
i seen him on the tv news a lot with all the other big shots
a fag you know
goes by another name down here
excited whats the other name
stunned clay bertrand is clay shaw
the guy who used to run the international trade mart
yeah whats the big mystery
everybody down here knows the guy
so why does he call himself bertrand
who gives a shit what he calls himself
now it gets positively spooky
in january in new orleans at the bolton ford dealership when the oswald we know is in russia there is a man using the name oswald to buy trucks for
the friends of democratic cuba
the salesman never saw him again but guess whos on the articles of incorporation of the friends of democratic cuba
reactions from the others banister has someone using the name oswald to buy the trucks
hoover at the fbi writes a memo dated june that there could be someone using oswalds passport and identity
they put oswald together from day one
like some dummy corporation in the bahamas you just move him around a board
sent him to russia in and out no passport problems
you got the word microdots in his notebook you got the minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions the sealed diz personnel file
for all we know there could be a dozen oswalds in different cities countries all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a
scapegoat after the assassination
does the real oswald know hes been put together
it doesnt matter does it
hes a low level spy he doesnt know who he really works for
lets call it a night
to lou anything new on ruby
the staff members anxious to go home have all risen
and now sigh
mobbed up all the way
tight with the dallas cops
im digging chief
i just need more men and some more dollars
i know you do lou
im doing three more lectures this month
youre all doing an incredible job sue al numa
but this is one where if you dont nail the other guy youre dead
he pulls a book from the bookcase for lou how did jack ruby dies so quick
a history of nazi germany lou
they were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the s
we learned a lot more than you think from the nazis
our biological warfare lab is in fort detrick maryland
close to where the national cancer institute is located
think about it

even my own wife chief looking at his watch whos wondering where i am

they all raise their hands as bill walks in excited
i fould clay bertrand
they all stop look

clay bertrand is clay shaw
director of the trade mart
this is incredible
pillar of the community by day gay bars at night
liz garrison is the most shaken as she pours a fresh pot of coffee
can you get some sworn statements
thats gonna be tough
i think we should have him in for a little talk
do you have any evidence against him jim
clay shaws done so much for the city with all that restoration in the quarter
hes well connected all his friends the money people be careful jim
itll be off the record honey
ill bring him in on a sunday
a quiet little chat between gentlemen
liz walks out of the room silent
there is a tense pause
the tv is on to the latest vietnam reports combat footage
announcer in heavy fighting in vietnam today seven more american soldiers died and were wounded
the body count for this week now stands at americans and enemy soldiers killed in action
liz plays with the kids looking for easter eggs
the dog is barking its a scene of commotion
jim is getting ready to go out
jim come on honey get down on your hands and knees and hunt for jaspers easter egg
you know i dont like these tribal rituals freckle face
im interviewing clay shaw this morning
as tv cuts to president johnson president johnson meanwhile at an informal press conference said he regretted that there is no end in sight to the war in vietnam where
american troops are now fighting
we face more cost more loss and more agony
in his proposal to raise taxes johnson
surprised but jim were going to antoines with the kids like we do every year
i told you i was going to talk to shaw
but why in the lords name would you do it in the middle of easter sunday when you knew we were
annoyed with her look because when i scheduled it i didnt realize it was a holiday
you were there why didnt you say something
look at the calendar for christs sake
you said a sunday not easter sunday
im sorry but its important
clay shaw is important
youre missing most of your life jim and you dont even know it
the kids are missing out too
harder its not just you making the sacrifice here honey
look ill rush and be there by two i promise
go ahead without me
as he leaves the camera holds on liz
clay shaw bertrand in an elegant white summer suit is shown in
indeed there is a slight limp to his gait which jim notices right away
he shares a look with bill
susie is also in the room
shaws rich bassoon voice drips with dialect
imperiously smoking a gaulois shaw has about him an air of authority matched only by jims
garrison what can i do for you on easter sunday
im sorry mr
shaw to interrupt this holiday but i feel this is a conversation we might better have out of the everyday bustle in this office
sitting im not sure i understand
bringing some papers forward well
in an investigation were conducting your name has come up a number of times
i wouldnt imagine where
we recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you
are you acquainted with a david logan
never heard of him
a perry russo
a willie okeefe
no i dont believe i know anyone by that name
okeefe told us he met you at the masquerade bar down in the quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on dauphine street
do you recall that
flashback to clays dauphine street residence in the quarter at night in
the butler opens the door and okeefe is admitted to the townhouse
shaw appears behind the butler
in present of course not
i dont know this man
obviously then i wouldnt have him to dinner
incidentally i do not live in an apartment
its an s house built by gallier
ive restored it faithfully
you know i am quite an advocate of restoration
at shaws house dinner is served at a long table by the black butler
the table is decorated by a sumptuous setting of silver and candelabra
shaw uses a bell to summon the butler
perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory
okeefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter a colored man
he particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other which he found rather unusual because the table was so long
does that bring back memories of willie okeefe
in present not at all
but on the other hand i do have a lovely chippendale dining table and i often have a friend over sitting at one end while i sit at the other
that is precisely the point of a long dining table
the splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it
i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps
it adds a taste of elegance for which i must confess a weakness for now and then
i call him smedley
his real name is frankie jenkins but i could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering frankie
where is this leading to mr
willie okeefe and clay shaw leave the dining table
after dinner you paid him to have sex with you
the quarter is filled with vivid imaginations my dear mr
garrison grimy young hoodlums wholl say and do anything
as you well know
in the course of that night mr
okeefe said a man named david ferrie stopped by the house
along with another young man
at shaws townhouse we see ferrie coming in with another young chicken
i have never known anyone by that name
of course never having met mr
okeefe i could hardly have met mr
and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours
we see the four men in drag smiling for the flash camera champagne bottles in hand
ferrie sniffs some poppers then shoves a popper in shaws face
to shaw youre mine mary
go get the fucking tools out bitch
i want some ass
ferrie forces more poppers on shaw
the camera movies to shaws bedroom where ferrie scatters a drawer full of leather tools
to shaw come here bitch
ferrie grabs shaw by the hair you want this
the only way you get this is do what i say
ferrie whacks shaw im the man
dont ever forget it
shaw begs and whines you want it
you want it
ferrie spits on shaw fuck you and your rich friends
youre nothing but a rich whore
youre my woman
get the cat
to young man strip
i want to see skin
back to garrisons office
in present let me show you his picture
he hands shaw a general photo of ferrie in present no
im sure ive never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance
does the name clay bertrand mean anything to you
i believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the chamber of commerce
is that the man you had in mind
no it was not
do you know an attorney by the name of dean andrews
one meets so many attorneys in my business
no i dont believe i know dean andrews
jim is getting incredibly irritated
he feels shaw is lying
cut to antoines restaurant where liz and all five kids look at menus
whenre we gonna eat
were going to start without him and hell be here for dessert
snapper you put that back
i want a shirley temple
disappointed whens daddy coming mama
hes real sorry he cant start with us but hes promised to be here
back to garrisons office later that day
everyone looks tired as the questioning goes on
shaw sucks on endless gauloises
handing a photo to shaw mr
shaw can you identify this man
he looks up are you claiming mr
garrison that mr
oswald also had dinner with me
shaw did you ever meet lee harvey oswald
you really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters dont you mr
please answer the question
of course not
such a pity that assassination
in fact i admired president kennedy
a man with true panache and a wife with impeccable taste
jim shows shaw a newspaper clipping
shaw this is an italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the board of centro mondo commerciale in italy that this company was a creature of the cia
for the transfer of funds in italy for illegal political espionage activities
it says that this company was expelled from italy for those activities
im well aware of this asinine article
and i am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper
it says that this company has heavily fascist ties to the french secret army organization that tried to assassinate de gaulle in
and that this company is linked to the schlumber tool company here in houma louisiana which is where their arms may have come from to david ferrie and his cubans
garrison youre reaching
i am an international businessman
the trade mart which i founded is americas commercial pipeline to latin america
i trade everywhere
i am accused as are all businessmen of all things
i somehow go about my business make money help society the best i can and try to promote free trade in this world
shaw have you ever been a contract agent with the central intelligence agency
shaw glares at him
with powerful contempt and if i was mr
do you think i would be here today
talking to somebody like you
no people like you dont have to i guess people like you walk between the raindrops
rising may i go
regardless of what you may think of me mr
garrison i am a patriot first and foremost
ive spent half my life in the united states military serving and defending this great country mr
shaw and youre the first person i ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president
now just a minute sir
youre way out of line
susie and bill quiet jim down
come on chief
as he shows shaw to the door im sorry mr
shaw its getting late
thats all the questions we have
thank you for your honesty and for coming in today
i enjoyed meeting with you gentlemen and you miss cox
it was most pleasant
i wish to extend to each of you and to each of your families my best wishes for a happy easter
beat excited one may smile and smile and be a villain
we got one of em
jim walks in contrite
liz is shutting down the house
some of the kids are still up
where have you been
kisses liz hi freckle face
liz im really sorry
the meeting went much longer than expected
we waited for you
you could have telephoned for gods sake
you promised jim
i dont know what to say except im sorry
i just dont have rabbits on my mind
i think you care more about john kennedy than your family
all day long the kids are asking wheres daddy
what am i supposed to tell your kids jim
i dont know what to tell them
how bout the truth im doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice wont be an arcane vanished idea they read about in
history books like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of atlantis
that sounds dandy but it doesnt replace a father and a husband on easter day
angry turns away its going to get worse honey
jim is coming down the corridor with broussard is confronted by some local journalists and tv crew members
we hear a hubbub of fierce questioning ad libs but jim puzzled brushes by seeking refuge in his office
lou al numa and susie are all waiting for him
the regular staff some people are looking wondering
lou presents him with the front page of the new orleans states item
congratulations boss youre page one
we see a close up of the headline d
launches full j
death plot probe mysterious trips cost large sums
striding into his office reading the paper goddamn sam
and it aint pretty reading the copy the ad has spent more than on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since november
they went to the public records and got the vouchers we requested for withdrawals
shaw mustve gotten them on our tail
could be ferrie martin andrews any of em
we didnt talk to ruby cause of them and theyre on our asses for a measly
jim at his desk finishes reading the article
a huge picture of him is on the front page
he puts down the paper reaching for a long gold pen that is part of the desk set
they hunted down the news its their business
getting angry doesnt accomplish a damned thing but this changes everything
we either pull out now or we go through some heavy flack together
they look at each other
bear in mind each of you this may affect the rest of your careers your lives
pause if any of you pull out i assure you i will bear no ill feelings towards that person and will reassign you to regular duties
there it is then
it means very much to me
im giving this office from my national guard savings so we can continue
i will make speeches where i can to pick up additional money
some local businessmen are putting together a fund for us and
coming in mr
garrison what shall i tell them
theyre piling up outside the door
they want a statement the phones are going crazier than bugs on a cake
jim stands repacks his briefcase with papers and reference books and heads for the back door elevator
neither confirm deny nor discuss sharon
goodbye ladies gentlemen im going home where i can get a decent days work done
lou drinks a beer in front of the tv news in his small bachelor apartment
a fan is blowing
garrisons own silence on the subject has raised some interesting questions
with taxpayer money has he uncovered some valuable new evidence or is he merely saving the information which will gain for him exposure on a national level
garrison it seems should have some explanation
the phone rings and ivon picks it up
very agitated did your office plant that garbage in the fucking paper
who is this
you know damn well who it is
yeah you got it
since youre the only straight shooter in that fuckin office id like an answer from you
did you plant it
dave do you think were out of our minds
the whole buildings been a zoo since that broke
we cant get a thing done
reporters crawling everywhere
you think we want that
we see ferrie in a phone booth on the street outside his apartment house in the french quarter
hes a nervous wreck watching the reporters and tv cameras surrounding his place waiting for him
yelling somebody planted that fucking story
and somebody tipped off the press im one of garrisons fucking suspects
i cant go home
im out on the street
the maggots are everywhere

ferrie hangs up
at his end lou ivon hangs up excited
the phone rings
liz picks it up
jim is watching the tv news martin luther king is delivering a speech against the vietnam war
on tv president kennedy said on one occasion mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind
i pray god that america will hear this before its too late because today were fighting a war im convinced is one of the most unjust wars that has ever
been fought in the history of the world

so please call the office number
hangs up two of them even had the gall to come to the door this afternoon one all the way from england

its not funny jim im scared
nothing to be scared about honey i been through four years of war this is nothing
the phone rings again
on tv sending them miles away to guarantee liberties in southeast asia which they have not found in southwest georgia or east harlem
so we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching negro and white boys on tv screens as they kill and die for a nation that has been
unable to seat them together in the same school
i havent jim
nothing is going to happen to you
i wont let it
leave us alone for gods sake
recognizes the voice oh its lou
jim and lou watch as ferrie paces wildly speeding
im caught in the middle
theyre after me
its almost over

ill stay as long as you want
i dont know who to trust anymore
yeah sure i could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of camels

as lou picks up the phone and orders room service jim answers
you mean about the cubans getting trained north of the lake
incoherent oh you got that
banisters pet project

lou writes it down
seeing him writing makes ferrie even more paranoid
im not cooperating with anyone
theres a death warrant for me dont you get it
wait a minute
youre not bugged are you
he feels lou for bugs but out of a sense of hierarchy ignores jim
he checks around the room the phone behind paintings flower vase light fixtures as the batty conversation continues dave i always play square
id love you to go on the record but i m in no hurry
whenever youre ready
checking the room i dont have much time
they dont even need bugs anymore
they got these fuckin satellite waves
they put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born right up his nostrils subcutaneous between his eyes
he was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment
a nazi rocket scientist father and a commie spy mother
youd never believe half the shit the agency does
holding his neck im so fuckin tired
havent slept since that shit article came out
whyd you guys have to go and get me involved with this
did we involve you dave or did clay shaw

the agency plays for keeps

he was in my civil air patrol unit
i taught him everything
a wanna be yknow nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch
i treated him good
hed talk about his kid yknow really wanted her to grow up with a chance but
he got a raw deal
the agency fucked him
just like theyre gonna fuck me
let me get this straight now
clay shaw is blackmailing you
how do you think the agency gets people to do their bullshit
fuck knows what they got on oswald
room service knocks and ferrie jumps and rushes to the bathroom
who is it
jim whispers something and lou goes to the door takes the service table without letting the bellhop in
jim excited but trying to stay even continues with ferrie
was it the same oswald dave that was in dallas or was it an impersonator
i didnt know no impersonator
flashback to ferrie at the party with oswald obscured per willie okeefes witness
jim in the present doesnt feel right about it
did you take a good look at the tv when they had oswald
shrugs cant be bothered black black just give it to me
takes the fresh coffee from lou lights a camel shit
im so exhausted
my neck is killing me
ive got cancer

its a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma
even the shooters dont fuckin know

i cant be talking like this
theyre gonna kill me

he sits down cracking sobbing i dont know what happened
all i wanted in the world was to be a catholic priest live in a monastery study ancient latin manuscripts pray serve god
but i had this one terrible fatal weakness
they defrocked me
and then i started to lose everything
he bows his head holding it in his hands and his wig starts to come off in his hands

you know at one time i even had a full head of hair like everyone else
and then i lost that
that fuckin clay shaw
i hate the bastard
all i got left is in his rotten bloody hands
he tipped the newspapers i know it
thats how the agency works
they use people chew them up spit em out

well talk then
but leave me alone for awhile
i got to make some calls
his eyes are going again
intrigue thru the tears
whatever you say dave
ill be home
lou and jim share a look
a mob scene
press from the u
and all over the world are filling the corridor
a french reporter tries to get past the receptionist as numa passes him with a stack of mail
also in the hall are many individual citizens who have come to give tips and theories
one of them is dressed as satan in a red jump suit with mask horns tail and a pitchfork
waving credentials paris match
we are the largest magazine in all of france
my name is bulgarinov
i am with literaturnaya gazeta of moscow
a mailman black comes through lugging three sacks of mail
coming through out of the way
you know who killed the president
garrison is busy but his assistant
a camera moves by into the interior offices
a man with the demeanor of julius caesar walks into bills office
raising arm hail
et tu brutus
and you too my friend
bill escorts him out before he gets the chance to sit down and then heads for jims office
numa joins jim with a stack of new mail
love a duck
it takes twenty minutes to get into this office these days
are we famous or what
jim is reading newsweek deeply hurt
there are newspapers all over his desk
notorious is more like it
jim garrison is right
there has been a conspiracy in new orleans but its a plot of garrisons own making
and this one of the d
s investigators offered an unwilling witness if only he would fill in the facts of the alleged meeting to plot the death of the president
how can they write that
where did they come up with this
sorting through others a charlatan power mad a hulking new york post morbid frolic in new orleans
bill has come in during this completely frazzled
the crazies have taken over the asylum
its a zoo out there
sensational garbage sells newspapers jim
what else is new
look at the thousands of letters youre getting
thats where the heart of the country is
reads from one dear mr
garrison god bless you for having the courage to go after the murderers of president kennedy
please dont stop till theyre behind bars
i am a beautician here in hannibal missouri and my husband is a janitor in the local high school
we have four kids and not an extra lot of money but we enclose a contribution to help with your work
we are praying for you
god bless judith hardy hannibal missouri
numa pulls a dollar bill from the envelope
thats what its about boss
for every lousy article in the press theres a hundred of these
jim is moved
bill is not
thats fine numa but what about all the people who arent writing letters
theyre sitting home reading all these lies
i just heard nbc crews in town to do a white paper not on the kennedy killing but on us
one of their top guys harry stoner is talking to everybody he can find about you boss
oh jesus stoner
why doesnt he call me
to bill what do you want to do bill fold up and close the store
you sound like it
look this is bigger than all of us
we cant try a case in this atmosphere
sharon has come in during this signalling to jim
millers been waiting
send him in
to numa denver oilman wants to support the investigation
specifically to bill bill i know what youre thinking but sometimes when it makes no sense thats exactly when you just gotta stick to it head down
sharon shows in mr
miller the denver oilman
hes a self assured impressive man in his s with a western accent cowboy boots and hat and a well cut gabardine suit
would you care for some coffee
yes thank you mr
your coffees almost turkish down here but i could get used to it
bill indicates hed like to sit in
jim nods okay
miller pays no attention to bill
im glad you could find time to see me
i flew down from denver this morning on my private jet
yes your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there
ive done quite well in denver mr
garrison but i have to admire someone like you and i have the means to back up what i say
we can use all the support we can get
i think these might interest you
jim has gathered together a group of photos of the shooting
sharon bringing the coffee
theyve been enlarged and show a lot of detail
splendid love to see them
he glances at the photo but continues on across the room looking at the pictures on the walls
where were you
you were lucky
i spent three years in the pacific
he looks out the blinds at tulane avenue ive never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail bonding companies
why is that
nettled by millers moving around i imagine because this is the criminal district court building showing a photo this is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket
we see a blurry blowup of something behind the picket fence
miller takes the photo glances at it and sits down
i know about that shot
a terrible tragedy
puts the photo back on the desk how much do you have for carrying on your investigation
if you must know virtually nothing
how many men are working with you on this
less than you would guess
most days two to three assistant d
a handful of police investigators
thats all youve had all this time
jim expectant of some help
then i admire you mr
how did you manage to make your way into guy banisters operation
the clock is ticking
jim shares a look with bill
the cards are on the table
that was never in he newspapers mr
miller smiles stands paces the room
he continues to ignore bill completely
im going to be very frank with you
youve done a great job an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you
but the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion
youre not going to do this country any good and youre not going to do yourself any good
he sits back down and looks directly at jim you dont belong here
on this mickey mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops
the job manages to keep me pretty busy
you should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact affect the world
here youre trying to climb up the steep side of mount everest
he leans forward across jims desk tapping his manicured index finger on the desk
clearly visible to jim and to us in a close up is millers annapolis ring tapping
i propose you accept an appointment to the bench in federal district court and move into a job worthy of your talent
he leans back and pauses do you have any idea do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged
and what would i have to do
stop your investigation
it was a magnificent effort but its over and done with
the press is already on your behind and thats only the beginning my boy only the beginning
how long do you think it would take me to be appointed
jims eyes go to bill
he could be wrong but its almost as if bill were going along with the idea now
smiling thinking jim is hooked well ordinarily these things take a long time
but in your case with your record it can be expedited easily
i guarantee it
jim leans back puts his feet up on the corner of the desk waving them like fans
who are you mr
no answer just the sound of the overhead fan you see that helmet over there
the nazi helmet with a bullet hole on his desk i picked that up at the dachau concentration camp when we liberated it in
it was the most horrifying sight ive ever seen mr
pyramids of decaying stinking bones and skin one on top of the other
i dont enjoy looking at that swastika every day mr
miller but i keep it there to remind me of what can happen when a country turns from free democratic principles to fascism when a few madmen turn human beings
into digits and millions sit in silence and do nothing about it
jim comes forward with his reply
miller you and i have met under a great misunderstanding
i havent the remotest interest in becoming a federal judge
and nothing is going to keep me from going ahead with my investigation of john kennedys murder
millers entire demeanor tightens into a corkscrew of anger and danger
miller and i have finished our conversation
would you show him out
bill has a strange reaction a sudden exhalation of breath as if an entire house of cards were collapsing
he rises but miller goes first leaving silently
once hes gone bill turns wearily to jim
thats proof enough right there of what were up against
the whole goddamn federal government bill
well they offered you the carrot and you turned it down
you know whats coming next dont you boss
the staff is assembled
we see the headline in the times picayune which says ferrie calls garrison probe a witch boss i tell you something or somebody is putting tremendous heat on david ferrie
if we sit on our behinds any longer i dont think the guys going to hold on
raps the newspaper look at this bullshit
he keeps changing what he says
we cant possibly call him to a grand jury
susie watch the language would you please
my instinct is that ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating and well end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks
if we call him now he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot weve ever had
you dont get it guys he cant go down any further
we got to protect him full time
rises looks at his watch i have a plane to catch
going to washington
an interesting lead says hes closely connected to these events but he wont come down here
i know what youre going through with ferrie lou
well talk tomorrow
im onto ferries cuban paymaster eladio del valle in miami
i gotta get him in boss
i need more men i cant even pull the teams to watch ferrie
this is our case
numa rushes in with a young investigator williams displaying a miniature microphone
to lou you just need some sleep lou
it wont look so bad when
numa makes violent signals to shut up not to talk sticking the microphone in front of jim
williams searches the walls for the bug
numa signals everyone outside
the staff comes out into the office with him disturbed
what the hell is
williams found this in your office
we think the conference room is also bugged
and maybe the phones
the whole place needs debugging
the whole staff from the conference room reacts
jim looks stunned
i dont believe it
bugging the district attorneys office of new orleans
sharon has been standing there trying to get lous attention
its urgent for you mr
lou goes to the phone
well believe what you want boss but we got to be more careful
all these new volunteers any one of them could be
okay you handle it numa
i dont have time for this nonsense
to the hidden mikes loudly weve obviously got the bastards worried now
im going to washington
everyone laughs but the camera goes to the look of shock on lous face as he holds the receiver
they all look over at him feeling the bad news before they hear it
dave ferries dead
the body was found at his apartment two hours ago
jims look says there goes the case
jim and his staff storm into the area which is cordoned off by police
members of the press are all over yelling questions at jim
to chief police officer this case is in our jurisdiction
i dont want anyone from a federal agency in here without an explicit federal court order
you got that hank
hank looks at him weirdly was ferrie murdered mr
do you have any leads
the apartment is filthy and sinister
hundreds of mice squeal in their cages upset by the invasion of men and light
nothing seems to have been washed in years
there is an accumulation of furniture college pennants photos of young boys in training books everywhere ammunition guns a piano maps fake college degrees on the walls
ferries naked body lies on the couch with a sheet over it
he is unwigged his eyebrows unpainted false teeth next to him
jim studies the corpse as the coroner comes alongside
whats it look like nick
i dont see any violence jim
heart attack maybe an aneurysm
looks like natural causes
jim picks several empty capless medicine bottles on a table next to the sofa and looks at them
lou and bill come over with a typed suicide note
its addressed to no one and no signature
to leave this life is for me a sweet prospect
i find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand everything that is loathsome
pretty flowery for dave ferrie
the words from the note hang there weirdly as jim paces on into the apartment one of them medicine bottles in his hand
the music grows and a sinister feel of danger and death pervades the atmosphere
then the sounds drop away
jim hands lou the medicine bottle
i took it once for a low thyroid condition
he walks away it raises the metabolism lou
pause did david ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism
id say the opposite hypertension
jim runs an eye through daves closet cluttered with shabby jackets
his eye falls on a neat but faded lace and satin some sort of garment of priestly origin he takes it in his hand
ferrie was the only one to express some kind of remorse about this whole thing
i think it got him killed
susie cox walks in a new message written on her face
boss we just got bad news from miami
they found ferries cuban friend eladio del valle this morning hacked to death with a machete in his car
he was tortured shot in the heart at point blank range and his skull was split open with an axe
jesus if that aint the devils piss
jims mood darkens and he heads back into the living room as ferries corpse is being trundled out the door
the sickness is everywhere an oppressive mood
bill comes up
found another note same thing no name no signature
when you receive this i will be quite dead so no answer will be possible
i offered you love
all i got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth
jesus they mustve been hard pressed to come up with that one
jim feeling ill wanting to leave stops the coroner before he exits
gives the coroner the empty bottle nick what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of proloid
hed die pretty quick either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain
can you ascertain if theres proloid in his system
not in a routine autopsy but if we looked at the spinal fluid there might be a high level of iodine but its difficult to know
whatcha thinkin jim
well it doesnt make sense nick he was afraid of dying then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes
shrugs skeptical if its a suicide i seen weirder jim
exits the fact is hes gone chief and sos our case
not unless we go for shaw now
with whose testimony
a male prostitute
a dope fiend
shaws got respect the newspaper editors the american bar association theyre not
im afraid im with bill on this one
we havent got the goods yet
we wait shaws gonna get whacked
oswald ruby ferrie del valle banister bowers
how many corpses you lawyers gotta see to figure out whats going on
all right all right
break it up
where you going boss
i dont know bill i just dont know
as jim questioned by reporters gets in his car and leaves bill waves goodbye to lou and walks toward his own car dejected
the area is cordoned off and humming with activity
frank an fbi man who knows bill from previous cases approaches him out of the crowd
he wears a hat suit and tie
hey where yat frank
youre wasting your time here
big jim gave strict orders
no fbi allowed
its you i want to talk to bill
laughs boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew
motions to car getting in the car your boss got a serious problem bill
we know whats been going on at your office smiles yeah i guess you do
youve got nothin bill
im talking as a friend now
youre riding on the titanic
time to jump off before you get destroyed along with garrison
frank i dont want to hear it
senator long set your boss up my friend
this gets bills attention
who do you think fed him that information
garrisons going down
were talking your career here bill your life
youre a young guy
we know youre working that castro thing
no im not
yes you are
look we know oswald didnt pull that trigger
but if that comes out theres gonna be a war boy millions of people are gonna die
thats a hell of a lot more important than jim garrison
suddenly goddammit look at me when i talk to you
youre too goddamn self opinionated now shut up
if you got a brain in that thick skull of yours listen to me
listen real hard
bill taken aback listens
jim walks down from the lincoln memorial where he is met unobtrusively by a military man in his s in casual clothing hat on his head an erect posture
they walk towards the mall with the capitol building looming in the background
shakes hands im glad you came
im sorry about the precautions
well i just hope it was worth my while mr
the man doesnt answer
jim after his meeting with miller and loss of ferrie is testy and suspicious
i could give you a false name but i wont
just call me x
ive already been warned by the agency mr
if this is another type of threat i dont
im not with the agency mr
garrison and i assume if youve come this far what i have to say interests you
but im not going to name names or tell you who or what i represent
except to say youre close youre closer than you think
something about his manner speaks of authority knowledge and above all old fashioned honesty the eyes looking at you straight on
he indicates a bench
everything im going to tell you is classified top secret
significant look i was a soldier mr
i was one of those secret guys in the pentagon that supplies the military hardware the planes bullets rifles for what we call black operations black ops assassinations coup detats
rigging elections propoganda psych warfare and so forth
world war ii rumania greece yugoslavia i helped take the nazi intelligence apparatus out to help us fight the communists
italy stealing elections france breaking strikes we overthrew quirino in the philippines arbenz in guatemala mossadegh in iran
vietnam in indonesia tibet we got the dalai lama out we were good very good
then we got into the cuban thing
not so good
set up all the bases for the invasion supposed to take place in october
khrushchev sent the missiles to resist the invasion kennedy refused to invade and we were standing out there with our dicks in the wind
lot of pissed off people mr
garrison you understand
ill come to that later
i spent much of september working on the kennedy plan for getting all u
personnel out of vietnam by the end of
this plan was one of the strongest and most important papers issued from the kennedy white house
our first troops were ordered home for christmas
tensions were high
in november one week after the murder of vietnamese president diem in saigon and two weeks before the assassination of our president
flashback to the pentagon offices in
x strides down a busy hall and into the offices of one of his superiors major general y a lean cold warrior battlefield handsome civilian clothes and several advisors
theres a u
flag on the wall
the status of y is only clear by the sing on the desk the name blocked by a passing figure
a strange thing happened
i was sent by my superior officer call him y to the south pole as the military escort for a group of international vips
this trip had nothing to do with my nine years of work in special operations
it was sort of a paid vacation
we hear vague ad lib mutterings on the soundtrack indicating a friendly atmosphere and we see stock footage of a c transport flying to antarctica and ice floes on the
surface of the sea
then at a new zealand airport we see x in a uniform at a newsstand reading of kennedys assassination
the banner headline of an extra edition of the christchurch star screams out kennedy shot dead
it wasnt until i was on my way back in new zealand that i read of the presidents murder
that was in the afternoon the next day new zealand time but already the papers had the entire history of an unknown year old man oswald a studio picture detailed
biographical data russian information and were pretty sure of the fact hed killed the president alone although it took them four more hours to charge him with the murder in texas
it felt as if well a cover story was being put out like we would in a black op
back at the pentagon office we see x returning and meeting y
the atmosphere is cordial but y is slightly different from before more harried more nervous
he turns away to light a cigarette he doesnt want the usual conversation
anyway after i came back i asked myself why was i the chief of special ops selected to travel to the south pole at that time to do a job
that any number of others could have done
one of my routine duties if i had been in washington wouldve been to arrange for additional security in texas
the secret service is relatively small and by custom the military will augment them
i checked it out when i got back and sure enough i found out someone had told the th military intelligence group at th army headquarters at fort sam houston
to stand down that day over the protests of the unit commander a colonel reich
we see an outdoor shot of the texas army headquarters on a day in
inside on the same day col
reich is on the phone puzzled
now this is significant because it is standard operating procedure especially in a known hostile city like dallas to supplement the secret service
even if we had not allowed the bubbletop to be removed from the limousine wedve put at least to agents on the sidewalks without question
thered already been several attempts on de gaulles life in france
only a month before in dallas un ambassador adlai stevenson had been spit on and hit
wed have arrived days ahead of time studied the route checked all the buildings
we never wouldve allowed all those wide open empty windows overlooking dealey
we would have had our own snipers covering the area
the moment a window went up theyd have been on the radio
we wouldve been watching the crowds packages rolled up newspapers a coat over an arm never would have let a man open an umbrella along the way never wouldve allowed
that limousine to slow down to miles per hour much less take that unusual curve at houston and elm
you would have felt an army presence in the streets that day but none of this happened
it was a violation of the most basic protection codes we have
and it is the best indication of a massive plot in dallas
who could have best done that
people in my business mr
people like my superior officer couldve told col
reich look we have another unit coming from so and so providing security
youll stand down
that day in fact there were some individual army intelligence people in dallas and im still trying to figure out who and why
but they werent protecting the client
one of them by the way was caught in the book depository after police sealed it off
in dealey plaza we see an army intelligence man taking a shot with a minolta camera
army intell had a harvey lee oswald on file but all those files have been destroyed
many strange things were happening that day and lee harvey oswald had nothing to do with them
we had the entire cabinet on a trip to the far east
we had a third of a combat division returning from germany in the air above the united states at the time of the shooting and at p
the entire telephone system went dead in washington for a solid hour and on the plane back to washington word was radioed from the white house situation room to lyndon
johnson that one individual performed the assassination
does that sound like a bunch of coincidences to you mr
not for one moment
the cabinet was out of the country to get their perception out of the way
the troops were in the air for possible riot control
the phones didnt work to keep the wrong stories from spreading if anything went wrong with the plan
nothing was left to chance
i bet you there were even backup teams and cars on the other side of the underpass in the event that kennedy got through wounded
they would have moved in with vehicles like they did with de gaulle
he could not be allowed to escape alive
the camera is on jim listening
this information is much greater than he ever envisioned and he is stunned
i never though things were the same after that
vietnam started for real
there was an air of i dont know make believe in the pentagon and the cia
those of us whod been in secret ops since the beginning knew the warren commission was fiction but there was something
and i knew allen dulles very well
i briefed him many a time in his house
he was also general ys benefactor
but for the life of me i still cant figure out why dulles was appointed to investigate kennedys death
the man who had fired him
i got out in
i retired from the u
i never realized kennedy was so dangerous to the establishment
is that why
chuckles thats the real question isnt it why
the how is just scenery for the suckers
oswald ruby cuba mafia it keeps people guessing like a parlor game but it prevents them from asking the most important question why
why was kennedy killed
who has the power to cover it up
you know in right after the bay of pigs very few people know about this i participated in drawing up national security action memos and
these are crucial documents classified top secret but basically in them kennedy instructs general lemnitzer chairman of the joint chiefs that from here on forward
flashback to the pentagon offices on a day in
a document is moved by hand into lemnitzers office where we see a set of hands holding it while its read
theres a look of surprise on lemnitzers face
the joint chiefs of staff would be wholly responsible for all covert paramilitary action in peacetime
this basically ended the reign of the cia splintered it as j
promised he would into a thousand pieces and now was ordering the military to help
this was unprecedented
i cant tell you the shock waves this sent along the corridors of power in washington
this and of course firing allen dulles richard bissell and general charles cabell all of them sacred cows of intell since world war ii
you got some very upset people here
documentary images flash on the screen allen dulles sweet faced smiling at the warren commission hearing and visiting dealey plaza general charles cabell and richard bissell
kennedys directives were never really implemented because of bureaucratic resistance but one of the results was that the cuban operation was turned over to my department as operation mongoose which
meant that people like my superior officer general y took over the cuban personnel that were being trained to invade cuba and the bases like the training camp at pontchartrain in your home state that were closed down by kennedy
and thats how the black ops people people like general y ended up taking the rules of covert warfare theyd used abroad and broughtem into this country
now they had the people the equipment bases and the motivation
check out an old cia man bill harvey ran something called executive action which carried out foreign assassinations
harvey was also involved with the fake defection program that got oswald into russia
check out the cabell brothers
interesting links to this case
at arlington cemetery on the same day jim visits the grave of president kennedy
we see the eternal flame
jim thinks about what he should do now
the size of it stuns him
he is lost reeling back to the past in his mind
dissolve to documentary footage of dachau concentration camp thousands of bodies are piled and bulldozed
and then back to jim at arlington cemetery reliving it
only the enormity of past evil can prepare him to confront present evil
in a strange way it reassures him
dont underestimate the budget cuts kennedy called for in march of either close to military installations in states overseas bases youre talking big money
you know how many helicopters have been lost in vietnam
about three thousand so far
who makes them
who owns bell
bell was near bankruptcy when the first national bank of boston approached the cia about developing the helicopter for indochina usage
how bout the f fighters
general dynamics in fort worth
who owns that
find out the defense budget since the war began
going on a hundred billion
billionll be spent before it ends
in it was billion
no war no money
sometimes i think the organizing principle of any society is for war
the authority of the state over its people resides in its war powers
even eisenhower military hero of wwii warned us about it beware the military industrial complex he said
kennedy wanted to end the cold war in his second term
he wanted to call of the moon race in favor of cooperation with the soviets
he signed a treaty with the soviets to ban nuclear testing he refused to invade cuba in and he set out to withdraw from vietnam
but that all ended on november
flashback to the white house
lyndon johnson is with henry cabot lodge
we see them as shadowy figures from a distance across the wide room or near a veranda with a porch and plenty of light
johnson his back to us talks in a loud thick texas drawl mostly muted and signs a document
only four days after j
was shot lyndon johnson signed national security memo which essentially reversed kennedys new withdrawal policy and gave the green light to the covert operations against north vietnam that provoked the
gulf of tonkin incident
in that document lay the vietnam war
in the park with x jim is staggered by all this information
x ceases walking and looks at jim
i cant believe it
they killed him because he wanted to change things
in our time in our country
shrugging kings are killed mr
politics is power nothing more
but dont believe me
dont trust me
do your own work your own thinking
the size of this is
no chance in hell mr
id be arrested and gagged declared insane and hospitalized
i can only give you background you got to find the foreground the little things
yknow youre the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of john kennedy
thats important its historic
i havent yet
i dont have much of a case
rising to leave but you dont have a choice anymore
youve become a significant threat to the national security structure
they wouldve killed you already but you got a lot of light on you
instead theyre gonna destroy your credibility they already have in many circles in this town
youre some kinda ego crazed southern caricature to many folks
be honest the best chance you got is come up with a case something anything make arrests stir the shitstorm
you gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack
remember fundamentally people are suckers for the truth and the truth is on your side bubba
i hope you get a break
jim watches this mystery man walking away
the figure vanishes in the washington breeze
flags flap over some distant memorial to some distant history of the republic
jim rises a decision made
jim lou al numa and several policemen stand at the door as clay shaw comes to it
shaw youre under arrest charged with conspiracy and entering into an agreement with other persons for the specific purpose of committing the crime of murder of president john f
kennedy in violation of
the voice dropping away as the devastated look on shaws face spreads sickly undone his arrogant public composure gone face now filled with terror disbelief
we have a warrant to search the premises
the policemen take shaw while the d
staff moves into the carriage house past the butler frankie jenkins
in the bedroom numa points out to jim the hooks screwed into the ceiling
al pulls out five whips several lengths of chain a black hood and matching black cape
dried blood is on one whip
its either a mardi gras outfit or we got the marquis de sade here chief
i dont care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo numa its none of our business
lets keep this side of it quiet shall we
when youre in a war boss you use every weapon you got
not one word
thats an order
shaw is being fingerprinted
he seems rattled
police officers try to get the press under control
first middle last
clay lavergne shaw
dauphine new orleans
ever use any aliases
habighorst notes it as routinely as shaw seems to have said it without thinking possibly preoccupied by thoughts of press people pushing in
next of kin
shaw what do you have to say
we see a shot of the exterior of the justice department in
the acting attorney general speaks to the press
shaw was included in our investigation and there was no connection found at all between shaw and the presidents assassin
jim confronts a packed room
bill is with him
shaw had no connection to the assassination why did the fbi investigate him
and why if they did is his name not mentioned once in the entire volumes of the warren report even it if is to clear his name
i doubt this attorney general would qualify for my staff
we see a shot of the supreme court building in washington d
and then a corridor inside the building
a chief justice looking gray and wise like earl warren moves along the corridor in his black robe delivering his verdict to the press
no i dont think so
garrison has presented absolutely nothing publicly to contradict our findings
as yet i have not heard one fact to refute the commission determination that lee oswald was the lone killer
in his own office jim responds to justice warren
i congratulate mr
most witnesses have to wait for trial before theyre allowed to produce sacred cows like the chief justice of the land as a character witness who is of course not
under oath and free from the laws of perjury
garrison if what you say is even partly true in this case you realize you are damaging the credibility of our government possibly destroying it
let me ask you
is a government worth preserving when it lies to the people
it has become a dangerous country sir when you cant trust anyone anymore when you cant tell the truth
i say let justice be done though the heavens fall
it doesnt play with the press
they shuffle off quiet whispering
liz and jim watch silently devastated as the nbc white paper unfolds attacking jim
they can do nothing
liz leaves the room upset
julia ann mercer looks at jim with sincere eyes
her husband a prosperous republican businessman watches from the corner
jim along with al has her testimony in front of him
in the sheriffs report mrs
mercer it says you were at dealey plaza two hours before the assassination but that
yes it was about in the morning
i was driving west on elm street toward the triple underpass in a rented car a blue valiant
ill never forget that day
flashback to dealey plaza in
its a normal scene cars traffic people starting to arrive for kennedys appearance
we catch a glimpse of julia ann mercer driving then stopping traffic
there was quite a bit of traffic and i was stopped alongside a green pickup truck
it was very noticeable because it was blocking traffic and it was parked with two wheels on the curb
when i saw the gun i thought the secret service is not very secret
she glances over at the man in the drivers seat
its jack ruby wearing a green jacket
then she sees a young white man in his mid s in a gray jacket brown pants plaid shirt and wool stocking hat getting out of the passenger side going
to the rear of the van opening a tool compartment and removing a package that looks like a rifle wrapped in paper
he walks up the embankment in the direction of the picket fence
ruby looks over and stares at julia ann who turns away and notices three police officers standing near a motorcycle on the overpass bridge
her eyes lock with rubys a second time and as the traffic moves she drives on
the next morning saturday i went to the fbi office and the agents showed me photographs
in the dallas fbi office mercer sits at a table looking at photos
two fbi agents stand near her showing her photos
she shakes her head no several times until they put a shot of jack ruby in front of her
she holds it up
i picked out three pictures that looked generally like the driver of the truck and then
thats the man
to second agent jack ruby
what about these others
you said they might be him
they look a little like him
but no holding up the ruby photo im sure this is the man
back in the present jim continues to question mercer
you mean you identified him on saturday the day before ruby shot oswald
when i saw him on tv i was shocked
i said to my family that was the man i saw in the truck
skeptical but you didnt seem nearly so sure in your statement to the warren commission
thats what bothers me mr
you see theyve been altered
jim is silent
mercer picks up the report and finds the pertinent paragraphs this says mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched
over the wheel of a green ford pickup truck
thats not true
i recognized him and i told them so
they also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck which it was not
she goes to another report on the dallas sheriffs report
this is really strange
see that notarized signature on the bottom of each page
thats not my signature
and there never was any notary present during any of my questioning
she hands the papers back to jim i guess thats all
mercer as a former fbi man its difficult to accept this
i know but mr
garrison the fbi is just not doing their job
im a republican mr
garrison and i dont go in for this kind of government bashing but i must tell you somethings not right when they dont even bother to call julia in front
of the warren commission
they didnt call a lot of people mr
i think its safe to say the warren report is a work of fiction
beverly a woman of ample proportions and a big cute texas face ex club singer meets with jim and lou ivon in a nightclub not unlike rubys carousel
beverly tell mr
garrison about the carousel club
oh yes i used to go over there a lot to see jack and especially my friend jada who danced there
it was the real swinging spot in town
businessmen politicians from austin lyndon johnsons friends
dallas was a slow town back then
you chewed toothpicks played dominos spit and dated policemen
but jacks was exciting
there were always cops there
jack liked em around but he used to throw the drunks out himself cause he was kinda a violent tempered man
it seemed everybody in those days knew jack was with the mob
the cops were bad back then theyd shake you down for the money in your pocket
they put a lotta people in the cemetery especially colored people
beverly what about lee
jada and beverly sit down at the table with ferrie oswald and jack with jack doing the buying
its too loud to hear anything
one time i came in jack introduces me to these two guys
he said beverly this is my friend lee
and i didnt catch the other guys name
he was a weird looking guy with those funny little eyebrows
the other guy lee didnt make much of an impression either
he wasnt good looking or nuthin he didnt look like he had any money and he was in a bad mood so i didnt pay him much mind
well i might not remember a name but i always remember a face
when i saw him tow weeks later on the television i screamed oh my god thats him
thats jacks friend
i knew right then it had something to do with the mafia
well about a week later after she told the newspapers shed met this guy lee with jack jada disappears off the face of the earth
never knew what happened to her till herman offered to sell me her wardrobe
i said but jadas coming back and i remember the way he smiled
and i knew she was never coming back
back to the scene
will you testify beverly
i dont think so sir
i thought when we came here we had an agreement
i just dont want to become another statistic like her
if they can kill the president do you think theyre gonna think twice about a two bit showgirl like me
we could call you in beverly
i know the pressure youre under beverly
dont think i dont
as he exits i understand
our view is from the roof of the building on the extreme south side of the plaza
price the building engineer in hat and overalls points for jim and lou
yes sir right here on this spot
the shots came from near that wooden fence over there near the overpass
the camera tightens on the picket fence
i saw a man run from this spot and go behind the book depository minutes later i gave this information to the sheriff
on the overpass near dealey plaza s
holland a tan elderly leather faced signal supervisor points to the picket fence for jim and lou
his accent is thick and rural
we saw him before briefly when jim was reading the warren report
i made it very clear to the warren people one of the shots came from behind that picket fence
i heard the report and saw the smoke come out about or feet above the ground right out from under those trees
there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind
flashback to the restaged shooting
the smoke hangs under the trees
cut to richard dodd on the overpass
hes a cowboy type with a hat and an even thicker accent than holland
pointing we all four of us all railroad men standing here seen about the same thing
the smoke came from behind the hedge and a motorcycle policeman dropped his cycle in the street and run up the embankment
flashback to the motorcycle
jim and lou walk with dodd and holland near the picket fence
we feel the emptiness of the area now and see the normal amount of traffic driving by
we came around here to look for tracks
it rained that morning and we found a bunch of cigarette butts
someoned been standing about here
the camera shows the spot and lou sighting
this is a good spot chief for the head shot
jim looks reliving the moment
later jim and lou stand on the south side of elm street in dealey plaza talking to jean hill an attractive ish teacher
her demeanor has a rock solid texas back country conviction to it shes a woman not easily frightened
i was standing here next to my friend mary mooman who took the photograph when he was killed
we see a flash of the moorman photograph a blurry polaroid with the president in the foreground and the picket fence in background
we will return to this photograph in more detail later
i jumped out in the street and yelled hey mr
president look over here we wanna take your picture
he looked up and then shots rang out
mary fell to the ground right away shouting get down theyre shooting get down theyre shooting
i knew it but i was moving to get closer to him
the driver had stopped i dont know what was wrong with that driver
and then out of the corner of my eye i saw this flash of light in the bushes and that last shot
just ripped his head off i mean blood brains just blew everything
flashback to the day of the shooting
we hear the sound of shots and see the grassy knoll from jeans point of view
i looked up and saw smoke from the knoll
and everything was frozen seemed like people wasnt even breathing like youre looking at a picture except this one guy
i saw this one guy running from the book depository towards the railroad tracks
and that was the same man i saw on tv two days later shooting oswald
that was jack ruby
no question about it
blurry image were not at all sure what or who or if
but a seed is planted
we see smoke the same smoke bowers saw
then jack ruby in a brown coat running from the book depository toward the railroad tracks
then we see jeans view as she runs toward the knoll along with others
there are yells shouts and general confusion
it was him i was chasing up the grassy knoll thinking our guys had shot back and maybe we got one of them
i dont know what i would have done if i had caught him but i knew something terrible had happened and somebody had to do something
at the picket fence we see blurry images of police officers railroad workers cigarette butts buddy footprints confusion
i never did catch him
all i saw in that parking area were railroad workers and dallas finest
two secret service types approach her suddenly and one of them puts an arm on her shoulder
secret service maam
youre coming with us
oh no im not
i dont know you
we gotta catch this shooter dont you realize
grabbing her other shoulder i said youre coming with us
i want the pictures in your pocket
he put a hurt on me but good
i dont have any pictures
i have to go back and find my friend mary
the two agents hustle her away
just smile and keep walking
hill years old that day is shown into a third floor office of the county courts building which has a view of the assassination area
other secret service agents are there
some people are detained there
time cut to two men interrogating hill
these new people never identified themselves
they musta been watching the whole thing cause they knew everything mary and me had been doing that day
i guess i wasnt too hard to find wearing that red raincoat
how many shots you say you heard
four to six
you heard echoes echoes
we have three bullets and three shots which came from the book depository and thats all were willing to say
which is strange cause this is less than minutes after the assassination
no i saw a guy shooting from over there
he was behind that fence
what are you going to do about it
we have that taken care of
you only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this
no one you hear
i was scared
it was all kinda queer but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three
and then they took marys five snapshots from me sent them to washington and when they returned them weeks later two of them had the backgrounds mutilated
the only one we saved was in marys camera
i didnt want to go to washington when the warren commission subpoenaed me
so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at parkland hospital
in a parkland hospital office in a lawyer interviews jean hill
a female stenographer takes notes
he asked me why i thought i was in danger and i said well if they can kill the president they can certainly get me
that doesnt make sense mrs
we have the man that killed the president
no you dont
he kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots
he was getting hot under the collar and telling the woman not to write when he wanted
look do you want the truth or just what you want me to say
i want the truth
the truth is that i heard between four and six shots
im not going to lie for you
you heard echoes
i had guns all my life
i used to go turtle shooting
i realize youre under a great deal of stress
its clouded your judgement
so off the record he starts talking about my family and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like i didnt know it or something
he got angrier and angrier and then look we can put you in a mental institution
we can make you look craziern marguerite oswald and everybody knows how crazy she is
i knew something was crooked as a dogs hind leg cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry
sure enough when i finally read my testimony as published by the warren commission it was a fabrication from start to finish
are you willing to testify mrs
back at the knoll
without hesitation damned right i would
somebodys got to tell the truth around here cause the government sure aint doing it
dissolve to a scene inside the texas school book depository in
jim and lou walk the floor and look out the windows
lou has a mannlicher carcano in his hand with a sight and clip
we see oswalds supposed view of the limousine as he pulls the trigger
now innocuous traffic goes by but the iris of the camera tightens into a snipers scope
the zapruder film establishes shots in
lou cocks the mannlicher for the first shot
jim looks at this watch
lou assumes the oswald pose crouched at the window aiming out
lou pulls quickly recharges the bolt fires recycles fires
between six and seven seconds
the key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other and it takes a minimum
seconds to recycle this thing
he recycles the bolt for firing the other problem is there was a tree right there
he points blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the zapruder film
didnt hoover say something about that
the leaves had fallen off in november
it was a texas live oak boss
he shakes his head it sheds its leaves the first week of march
you try to hit a moving target at yards through heavy foliage with this cheap dollar sucker the worlds worst shoulder weapon
the fbi tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match oswalds performance
and oswald was at best a medium shot
the scope was defective on it too
i mean this is the whole essence of the case to me
the guy couldnt do the shooting
and they sold this lemon to the american public
the zapruder film is the proof they didnt count on lou
we gotta get our hands on it
that means we gotta subpoena time life on it
looks out the window why not just shoot kennedy coming up houston
theres plenty of time hes out in the open a frontal shot
jim points the carcano south right up houston street following a car that happens to be passing by a convertible with an unknown woman driving
i asked myself the same thing
even if you miss the first shot if he accelerates you still got him for a second shot
the only reason for waiting to get him on elm is you got him in a triangulated crossfire
you got him on a flat low trajectory from the front at the fence there
the camera swings to the grassy knoll and the picket fence as seen from the sixth floor of the depository
you put a third team there in that building on a low floor
the camera swings to the daltex building across the street
when kennedy gets to the kill zone its a turkey shoot
aiming how many men
one spotter on a radio
maybe three teams
id say these were professional riflemen chief serious people
it takes skill to kill with a rifle thats why theres been no execution of an executive with one in years
he taps jim on the shoulder or else abort
jim pulls the dead trigger reliving the moment through the scope on a passing car
main streets over there the original parade route on the way to the trade mart
too far right
jim swings the scope up to confront main street
another car is in his sight
so they changed the route to bring it this way
moving at a normal mph they knew the motorcade would have to slow to about miles per hour to make this turn
thats where you get him
the camera swings to the houston and main intersection
who do you think changed the parade route
they did a dry run with chief curry a few days before
but they didnt bother running through dealey
they stopped right there said something like and afterwards theres only the freeway and went home
you know who the mayor was
and guess who his brother is
general charles cabell
deputy director of the cia
fired by kennedy in because of the bay of pigs fiasco he moved back to the pentagon called kennedy a traitor
when he came to new orleans to address the foreign policy association you know who introduced him
our friend clay shaw
the warren commission call him
shaking his head his boss was the one on the warren commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community
he nods head of the cia since
kennedy fired them both
cabell was his deputy for nine years
sickened talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop
now well have to subpoena them lou
theyre gonna love you chief
lou walks to another window in the empty book depository where oswald supposedly did his dirty deed and looks out over the plaza with all its ghosts
jim and lou are two men with only two mens power
a terrible aloneness pervades their minds
maybe we should just call it a day lou
while were still a little behind
we got two people killed maybe more we never thought about
you never got anyone killed boss
their actions killed them years before
if we stopped now itd be even more wrong
flashback to the sixth floor of the texas school book depository the same place jim and lou are now
jim looks around and sees one shooter and one spotter with a lunchbox radio in repairman clothes
jim is watching
neither of these men is oswald
we hear the sounds of the motorcade below
the shooter pulls the trigger on the carcano
a loud frightening sound snaps jim back to the present
in present subpoena them lou dulles the cabells time life
the whole damned lot of em
we see another smoke filled conference of assistants
paperwork is stacked in the corners almost to the ceiling there are coffee cups and doughnuts on desks
the disorganization and lack of resources are apparent
the staff working on this project now numbers some eleven people and there are some new investigators and assistants
we sense that the trial is drawing closer
attorney in washington declines to serve our subpoena on allen dulles charles cabell cia director richard helms or any fbi agent we named
well what do you expect from a pig but a grunt
without them its going to be near impossible chief to prove shaws connection to the cia
we got the same problem with the governors
all of them
reagan in california wont give us brading ohio refuses orville townsend texas on arcacha and nebraska on sandra moffet
what the hell is going on
never before has an extradition request from this office been refused
we havent tried to get julia anne mercer in
no she could get hurt
if you believe whats happening to these other people
shes the best damn witness we have
i just dont want to do it
numa is opening another stack of letters
the dollar bills keep coming
he points to two giant stacks of mail
hate mail here
fan mail here
the bad news is the irs has just requested an audit on your income from this office
he snorts i expected that two months ago and theyre wasting their time
the bad news is the national guard has just asked me to resign after years
we see his hurt well maybe thats good news it was never as good as combat but this is
bill any more on oswald and shaw
they were seen together in clinton in early september
the civil rights movement was running a voter registration drive
rumor is shaw a local boy was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement
no one really knows what they were doing there but everyone sure saw em
they stood out like cottonballs
i got whites and blacks saw em but last time i checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote
we still got the negro junkie vernon bundy saw em talkin at the seawall near lake pontchartrain
but its tough boss no one wants to talk about shaw
back to present you know you keep saying that
keep saying what
youre not digging
i think clinton is a breakthrough
shaw denies he knows ferrie or oswald
is that right
it proves hes a liar
keep on it bill
a look from lou this is interesting are you ready for this
oswald went to see the fbi two weeks before the assassination
it seems special agent hosty made three routine visits to his house supposedly to keep an eye on marina oswald
flashback to dallas fbi office in
oswald is at the counter addressing the female receptionist
i want to see special agent hosty
im sorry hes not in
can someone else help you
can i use a pen
he left a note
hosty told a dallas newspaperman it was a warning to him to stop questioning marina at their home when oswald was not present
she was not a citizen so possibly he was threatening to deport her back to russia
timecut to fbi james hosty confronting his agitated superior fbi agent shanklin in one of his cubicles
but what the note really said no one knows because his boss shanklin told hosty
reading the note oswalds dead now
theres no trial
get rid of it
i dont even want this in the office
get rid of it hosty
he gives it back to hosty hosty tore it up and flushed it down the toilet
waggoner carr the attorney general of texas says he had evidence from the dallas sheriffs office that oswald had been employed as an undercover informant for the fbi at a
salary of a month beginning more than a year before the murder
in present this is just speculation people but what if the note was describing the assassination attempt on j
the staff seem surprised by the thought come on guys think thats the only reason to destroy it because if it was any kind of threat like hosty said they
wouldve kept it cause it makes their case against the angry lone nut stronger
remember the new orleans meeting with agent quigley the day he got busted
flashback to oswald under arrest meeting with quigley
there again quigley destroyed the notes of the meeting
i think we can raise the possibility that oswald not only was an informant but that he may well have been the original source for the telex we have dated
november warning of the kennedy assassination in dallas on november
holds up the telex
we see a close up urgent to all sacs william walter the night clerk on duty here in the fbi office gave me a copy of this
it went all over the country
nothing was done and the motorcade went ahead on schedule and this wasnt even mentioned in the warren report
read it al
threat to assassinate president kennedy in dallas texas november
information received by the bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate president kennedy on his proposed trip to dallas texas etc etc
flashback to new orleans fbi office in
walter the night clerk receives the teletype reads it and runs it
shortly after the assassination walter says the telex was removed from all the files in all cities as an obvious embarrassment to the bureau
i believe oswald was sending information through hosty
flashback to a dallas safe house in
oswald ruby and several cubans including the bull and the indian are talking
i have a hunch that from the get go oswald had infiltrated this group probably cubans or right wing extremists
he was at the book depository that day told to be there by their handlers either to prevent the assassination or to take part in it
they coulda told him anything either they were going to close down the plotters that day or they were going to fake an attack on kennedy to whip up public
opinion against russia or cuba and reverse his policies it doesnt really matter what they told him cause he was under orders he was a foot soldier
underneath the voice over we hear and see oswald with a floor plan of the book depository at the center of the group
jack ruby bull and the indian two or three young cubans and a young white shooter the man in the plaid shirt described by julia ann mercer are also there
to the two young cubans i can get you in and up there
this is a shot out the southeast window of the sixth floor
that floor will be unoccupied between noon and one
what about the elevator
i can close it off
the only access is a stairwell
we get them in as an air conditioning unit
a floor refurbishing group
got the van the uniforms
his back to the screen if we can get the motorcade to turn from main onto houston thatll do the trick cause itll slow down to make the turn here
you cant miss
to the two young cubans hes a dead duck
ruby shares a look with bull unbeknownst to oswald and then we see the looks on the faces of jims team
i dont buy it chief why would the fbi cover it up
youre talking the whole fbi here
a telex that disappears from every single fbi office in the country
theres a word orders
back in garrisons office in
or a cover up
jesus bill dont you have enough proof of the fbis complicity now
to susie maybe i have a little more respect for this countrys institutions than you do susie
you tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the mob the cia fbi and army intelligence and who knows what else when you know you
cant even keep a secret in this room between people
we got leaks everywhere
were going to trial here
what the hell do we really got
oswald ruby banister ferrie are dead
shaw maybe hes an agent i dont know but as a covert operator in my book hes wide open for blackmail cause of his homosexuality
shaws our toehold bill
i dont know exactly what he is where he fits and i dont care
i do know hes lying through his teeth and im not gonna let go of him
so for those reasons youre going to trial against clay shaw chief
well youre gonna lose
we should be investigating all our mafia leads here in new orleans carlos marcello santos trafficante i can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the government
rubys all mob knows oswald sets him up
hoffa trafficante marcello they hire some guns and they do kennedy and maybe the government doesnt want to open up a whole can oworms there because it used the mob
to get to castro
yknow castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to john q
so they close the book on j
it makes sense to me
i dont doubt their involvement bill but at a low level
could the mob change the parade route bill or eliminate the protection for the president
could the mob send oswald to russia and get him back
could the mob get the fbi the cia and the dallas police to make a mess of the investigation
could the mob appoint the warren commission to cover it up
could the mob wreck the autopsy
could the mob influence the national media to go to sleep
and since when has the mob used anything but
s for hits up close
the mob wouldnt have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude
assassins need payrolls orders times schedules
this was a military style ambush from start to finish
a coup detat with lyndon johnson waiting in the wings
oh now youre saying lyndon johnson was involved
the president of the united states
his voice is challenging
theres a pause
the men exchange looks and wait
i know this bill lyndon johnson got billion for his texas friends brown and root to dredge cam ranh bay for the military in vietnam
thats just for openers
boss are you calling the president a murderer
if im so far from the truth why is the fbi bugging our offices
why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered
why are federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before
maybe cause theres some rogue element in the government
the others in the room groan at the reasoning
bill feels embittered cornered
with a full blown conspiracy to cover it up
yever read your shakespeare bill
julius caesar brutus and cassius they too are honorable men
who killed caesar
twenty twenty five senators
all it takes is one judas bill a few people on the inside pentagon cia
he gets up this is louisiana chief
how the hell do you know who your daddy is
cause your momma told you so
youre way out there taking a crap in the wind boss and i for one aint going along on this one
he exits jim sighs saddened
bill was one of his best men
chief ive had my doubts about bill for a long time
hes fighting everything
we need him back
bill wasted a goddamn month trying to prove that mob boys like barding and jack ruby played ball in right field with hunt oil
i dont trust the guy
standing gentlemen i will not hear this
i value bill as much as anyone here
lou reacts angrily we all need to make room for someone elses ideas lou especially me
maybe oswald is what everyone says he is and im just plain dumb wrong
ive seen him copying files leaving here late at night
i just plain dont trust him anymore
angry maybe you didnt hear what i said
i will not tolerate this infighting among the staff i warn you that
suddenly boss then im afraid i cant continue working with bill
pause then quietly are you giving me an ultimatum lou
well if thats what you want to call it
i didnt ever think it would come to this
i guess i am boss
i will not have any damned ultimatums put to me lou
ill accept your resignation
you sure got it
youre one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch d
and youre making one hell of a mistake
he storms out
arent you being a little hard
no i dont think i am susie
its after dinner and toys scattered around the living room
snapper is chasing his sister elizabeth around
virginia runs to the ringing phone in the living room as her mother and mattie stunned watch the news of martin luther kings death on tv
what have they done
angrily its lynchin time

your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest

how old are you

cut to jims study where jim also watches the news in horror
we see tv images of martin luther king on the motel balcony dead
to repeat year old martin luther king who preached non violence and won the nobel peace prize was cut down earlier today by a snipers bullets while standing on the
porch of the lorraine motel in memphis tennessee
he was surrounded by his closest aides
the police say they have no suspects at this time
jim visibly shaken slams his book down on the desk in frustration
back to the male voice on the phone
and you get of from school at every day
do you walk home
liz comes to the phone a wary look on her face
taking the phone who are you talking to
okay virginia thats all i need to know

after a pause the man hangs up
excited mama im going to be in a beauty contest

absorbed in the tv what

she runs out past the stunned kids sobbing as she goes up the stairs
jim pursues her like an angry spirit yelling up the stairs at her
go on then get out

join the rest of them
theyll tell you im crazy
you got plenty of peoplell tell you jim garrisons crazy
you wont have a problem filing your divorce papers on me
somebodys got to try goddammit somebody
the kids move away fearful
quaking with rage and hurt jim stands there at the bottom of the stairs strangled with pain
he takes a law dictionary in his hand and throws it across the room
jasper and virginia come over to him

well it looks like it jasper
because of kennedy
jim doesnt answer are the same people gonna kill us daddy
no jasper nobodys gonna kill us

bending down theres nothing wrong with feeling a little scared jasper virginia
telling the truth can be a scary thing
it scared president kennedy but he was a brave man
if you let yourself be too scared then you let the bad guys take over the country dont you and then everybody gets scared
stay with mom daddy
the band strikes up when the saints go marching in introducing jim who strides in from the wings to shake hands with jerry johnson the friendly looking host
and now jerry heres big jim garrison district attorney of new orleans louisiana
the audience is enthusiastic
jim smiles and waves then sits down next to johnson
welcome district attorney garrison
may i call you jim
ive been called everything under the sun jerry
call me whatever you like
he reads from a script on the desk
first we had your charge that the cuban exiles killed the president then the mob then you said the oil billionaires did it then you said the minutemen and the
ku klux klan collaborated to do it now your latest theory seems to be that the cia and the fbi and the pentagon and the white house all combined in some elaborate conspiracy to kill john kennedy
let me ask you is there anyone besides lee harvey oswald who you think did not conspire to kill the president
he fixes his eyes on jim waiting for a reply
a weariness has set in on jim
once more into the slaughter
how many hours do i have to answer that one
well lets just say this jerry ive stopped beating my wife
the audience laughs or maybe you should ask lyndon johnson
we know he has some answers
the audience loving it cheers
johnson looks at jim blankly and reads the next question on his list
there have been a number of reports in reputable news media time newsweek our own nbc that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor that
youve intimidated and drugged witnesses bribed them urged them to commit perjury
what is your response
your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching jerry
it indicates that the age of innocence is not yet over
but seriously jerry people arent interested in jim garrison they want the hard evidence
they want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to
interrupting some people would say youre paranoid
well if i am why is the government concealing evidence
why would they
pulling out his briefcase thats exactly my question jerry
maybe id better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what i am talking about
he pulls out a large blowup of the allen photo of the three hoboes and starts to hold it up in front of the camera
these arrests were photographed minutes after the assassination and were never shown to the american public
it takes johnson a few moments to realize whats happening
when he does he lunges like a cobra for the photographs pulling jims arm down so the pictures are out of the cameras view
sharply pictures like this dont show up on television
holding the picture up again sure they do
the camera can pick this up
yanking his arm down no it cant
jim swings the picture up a third time but the stage director gives a cut signal finger across the throat and the red light on the camera blinks off
the monitor shows another camera panning the audience
quickly realizes hes about to be cut off those men you just saw were arrested in dallas minutes after the assassination
they were never seen again
no record of arrest no fingerprint no mugshot nothing
they all got away
the director frantically gives johnson the cut sign
well be back after these messages
the audience cheers as the commercial comes on
jim comes home
his wife and two of the children are waiting in the doorway
al oser interrupts
jim bad news
bills turned boss
i think hes given everything weve got to the feds
we studied the memos there was nothing there chief nothing
when we went to confront him the landlady said that sonofabitch just took off left everything
to jim im sorry
something sure scared him
bill doesnt scare that easy
somebody got to his thinking
he was never that good a thinker
on the tv the news is on
much is at stake tonight in california
public opinion polls show senator robert kennedy of new york leading senator eugene mccarthy of minnesota
their anti vietnam war message is obviously striking a chord with the voters and whoever wins tonight will certainly emerge as the favorite over vice president humphrey to win the
nomination in chicago in august
that man now seems to be senator kennedy
we see a shot of robert kennedy in los angeles with his supporters
sure sounds like hes winning
hell never make it
if he wins theyll kill him
he wants to avenge his brother
hell stop that war
no theyll kill him before they let him become president
liz shares a look with al and numa
boss with broussard they have everything
all our witnesses our strategy for the trial
wed have to doublecheck all his work there could be false leads
we gotta rethink this trial
we dont have a choice
i dont think so al
you remember the hemingway story the old man and the sea
al nods the old fisherman manages to catch this great fish a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back
but by the time he reached shore the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton
then what are we going through all this trouble for
its a means to an end
this war has two fronts in the court of law we hope against the odds to nail clay shaw on a conspiracy charge
in the court of public opinion it could take another or years for the truth to come out but at least were going to strike the first blow
and if youre wrong
rising i never doubted for a second that i was
softly will you come to the trial elizabeth
i dont think so jim
she walks out
we see the outside of jims house and hear crickets chirping the purr of the suburb
inside the tv election results are still on
with of the precincts reporting senator kennedy continues to hold a lead of to over senator mccarthy
cbs news has projected senator robert kennedy the winner of the crucial california primary
jim is in the kitchen fixing himself a sandwich
theres a strange feeling in the house
we hear the wind a shutter sighing
jim suddenly doesnt feel alone in the kitchen
voice over on tv and that is what has been going on within the united states over the last three years the division the violence the disenchantment whether its between
blacks and whites between poor and the more affluent or between age groups or the war in vietnam we can start to work together
we are a great country an unselfish country and a compassionate country
i intend to make that my basis for running
he waves and leaves the podium going back through the kitchen of the hotel
jim is frozen in his spot shaken
the ghost of jack kennedy as he was before the killing stares at him through the kitchen as if encased in a hologram
the hooded eyes watch jim without expression
theyre communicating in some strange subliminal way
suddenly shots ring out from the television and theres pandemonium
shaken the television shows a scene of confusion
jim walks out looking at the tv struck down with his foreknowledge and his inability to do anything about it
in their bedroom upstairs that night jim gently wakes liz and holds her
they killed him honey
strangled he won
and they killed robert kennedy
they shot him down
realizing with terror oh no
i cant believe it
i cant believe it
both of them both brothers oh my god
she clings to him horrified
he caresses her hair
they look in each others eyes
youre right it hasnt ended has it
he kisses her gently they start to make love numbed needing each other needing their love in an increasingly terrifying world
awkward i wish i couldve loved you more
i feel sometimes like i didnt ever
love you or the children enough
the scene is like a circus
armed uniformed guards with walkie talkies are everywhere
guards with rifles are on the rooftop
there are crowds of reporters from around the world and many onlookers
everyone going into the courtroom is frisked by electronic metal detectors
jim accompanied by mattie the maid but not his wife forges his way through a tightly packed crowd to the prosecution table joining al susie numa and others from his
young law student have come to watch
the crowd is noisy to the point of unruliness
suddenly theres a hush as everyone cranes their necks to see clay shaw and his attorneys irvin dymond and two others enter the court
shaw impeccably dressed his high handsome cheekbones sucking on an ever present cigarette in a porcelain filter smoking in court was allowed then smiles to those who greet him as
if they were not really there and limps past jim with a stony indifference
the clerk starts pounding the gavel to call the court to order as judge edward aloysius haggerty sweeps in and takes the bench
hes a stocky little jimmy cagney look alike with fierce blue eyes under bushy brows
the jurors nine white men and three black men all dressed in suits and ties look on
cut to willie okeefe pointing out clay shaw
thats clay bertrand
thats the man i saw at david ferries
irvin dymond cross examines okeefe
words wafting thats who you say you saw
a confessed homosexual convicted of solicitation pandering
a man who has lied about most everything who
time cut to vernon bundy a poor black man who points at shaw
it was that man there yessir
he was at the pontchartrain wall with the man who shot the president
i remember him cause o his limp there
a heroin addict injecting himself at the wall barely conscious
time cut to jim looking over at a strange man matthews a kind of lawyer making notes and conferring with shaw and dymond
matthews seems to have some authority over both men
corrie collins a black woman who is one of the core workers from clinton is on the stand
pointing at shaw that was the man there
he dropped oswald off on the voter line
i remember cause they were the only white strangers around that morning
that big black cadillac of his made me think they might be fbi
time cut to the town marshall on the stand
looking at shaw said he was a representative of one international trade mart in new orleans
more than five years ago for two minutes
its fair to say you could be mistaken isnt it
time cut to dymond cross examining dean andrews shaking his head
figment of my imagination
the cats stewing me the oysters shucking me i told him you got the right at at but the wrong oh oh
bertrand is not shaw scouts honor and you can tell him i said so
counter arguing objection your honor
this office has won a conviction of perjury against dean andrews on this matter
that case is on appeal
time cut to charles goldberg a mild looking new york accountant on the stand with dymond cross examing
relishing this mr
goldberg you claim you met david ferrie and clay shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in new york you had drinks and under the influence discussed
killing kennedy is that not so
well i wanted to make sure shes the same girl i sent
and why are you experiencing this paranoia
launching into his explanation well you see ive been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since when i was in korea
we see the faces of people in the courtroom
the judges face
obviously goldberg is disturbed or maybe he is telling the truth but it doesnt play well
jim looks at al sickly
he was one of broussards witnesses chief
he was totally sane when we took his affidavit
but how does dymond know what to ask
when someone tries to get your attention catch your eye thats a clue right off
time cut to jim calling officer habighorst to testify
your honor i call police officer aloysisus habighorst to the stand
habighorst the clean cut police officer who booked clay shaw on the day of his arrest starts forward
im going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom
this is an ugly surprise for jim
we see him at the bench arguing loudly with the judge
susie dymond and al are also there
im sorry jim but the defendant did not have his lawyer present when asked
flashback to in the new orleans police station
shaw is being booked
the press is there and habighorst is questioning him
we see a close up on habighorst typing this in
jesus ed from time immemorial its been standard booking procedure to ask an alias
you know that
theres no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions
i callem as i seeem jim
im ruling it inadmissible
thats our case
if thats your case you didnt have a case
i wouldnt believe whatever habighorst said anyway
i cant believe youre saying this in the courtroom
feistier well i am saying it
bring in the jury
were filing for a writ to the appellate court
you do that
dymond goes back to shaw very please
shaw smokes icy
jim devastated sits feeling its over
cut to clay shaw on the stand
dymond cross examines him
no i did not
ever called dean andrews
no i did not
and have you ever met david ferrie
with a smirk of amusement no i would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures ive been shown
did you ever use the alias clay bertrand
no i did not
jim rises slowly out of his chair
well a very great actor has just given us a great performance your honor but we are nowhere closer to the truth
let it be noted my office is charging clay shaw with outright perjury on the fifteen answers he has given not one word of this
youre out of order jim boy now sit down
strike those remarks
cut to later in the trial
a movie screen has been installed for the jury
jim paces dramatically as if waiting casting looks at the door
members of the press pack the hot room and a fan turns overhead
to prove their was a conspiracy involving clay shaw we must prove there was more than one man involved in the assassination
to do that we must look at the zapruder film which my office has subpoenaed
the american public has not seen that film because it has been kept locked in a vault in the time life building in new york city for the last five
there is a reason for that
the zapruder film mm now rolls
we have seen pieces of it before in the opening of the film but now we see it whole
it is crucial that this piece of film be repeated several times during the trial to drive home a point that is easily lost on casual viewing
the first viewing is silent except for the sound of the clanky projector
it lasts about seconds and then the lights come on
the jury is shaken
the judge is shaken
the people in the courtroom murmur
even clay shaw is surprised at what he has seen
jim says nothing letting the truth of it sink in
then a picture speaks a thousand words
yet sometimes the truth is too simple for some
the warren commission thought they had an open and shut case three bullets one assassin but two things happened that made it virtually impossible the zapruder film which you just
saw and the third wounded man jim tague who was nicked by a fragment down by the triple underpass
the time frame of
seconds established by the zapruder film left no possibility of a fourth shot from oswalds rifle but the shot or fragment that left a superficial wound on tagues cheek had
to come from a bullet that missed the car entirely
now they had two bullets that hit and we know one of them was the fatal head shot
so a single bullet remained to account for all seven wounds in kennedy and connally
but rather than admit to a conspiracy or investigate further the commission chose to endorse the theory put forth by an ambitious junior counsellor arlen specter
one of the grossest lies ever forced on the american people weve come to know it as the magic bullet theory
cut to a drawing which has been put on a chair for the jury
jim has also moved al acting as j
into a chair directly behind the larger numa acting as governor connally
he demonstrates with a pointer
the magic bullet enters the presidents back headed downward at an angle of degrees
it then moves upward in order to leave kennedys body from the front of his neck his neck wound number two where it waits
seconds turns right and continues into connallys body at the rear of his right armpit wound number three
then the bullet heads downward at an angle of degrees shattering connallys fifth rib and leaving from the right side of his chest wounds four and five
the bullet continues downward and then enters connallys right wrist wound number six shattering the radius bone
it then enters his left thigh wound number seven from which it later falls out and is found in almost pristine condition on a stretcher in a corridor of parkland
he shows a mock up of the pristine bullet thats some bullet
anyone whos been in combat can tell you never in the history of gunfire has there been a bullet like this
the court laughs the army wound ballistics experts at edgewood arsenal fired some comparison bullets and not one of them looked anything like this one
he shows mock ups of comparison bullets take a look at ce an identical bullet fired through the wrist of a human cadaver just one of the bones smashed by
the magic bullet
yet the government says it can prove this with some fancy physics in a nuclear laboratory
of course they can
theoretical physics can prove an elephant can hang from a cliff with its tail tied to a daisy but use your eyes your common sense he holds the bullet seven
wounds skin bone
this single bullet explanation is the foundation of the warren commissions claim of a lone assassin
and once you conclude the magic bullet could not create all seven of those wounds you have to conclude there was a fourth shot and a second rifleman
and if there was a second rifleman there had to be a conspiracy which we believe involved the accused clay shaw
fifty one witnesses gentlemen of the jury thought they heard shots coming from the grassy knoll which is to the right and front of the president
jim walks to a drawing of an overhead view of dealey plaza
on it are dots representing locations of the witnesses
he points to each portion
he pauses and looks out into the courtroom liz has entered accompanied by jasper
quietly she takes a seat
jim is unbelieving at first then very moved
he takes a beat then key witnesses that day charles brehm a combat vet right behind jean hill and mary moorman s
holland and richard dodd on the overpass j
price overlooking the whole plaza randolph carr a steelworker who served in the rangers in north africa william newman father of two children who hit the deck on the north
side of elm abraham zapruder james simmons each of these witnesses has no doubt whatsoever one or more shots came from behind the picket fence
twenty six trained medical personnel at parkland hospital saw with their own eyes the back of the presidents head blasted out
cut to dr
peters on the stand
describing the wound a large cm opening in the right occipitoparietal area a considerable portion of the brain was missing there
he gestures to his head cut to dr
mcclelland on the stand
almost a fifth or perhaps a quarter of the back of the head this area here
he indicates his head had been blasted out along with the brain tissue there
the exit hole in the rear of his head was about mm
there was also a large piece of skull attached to a flap of skin in the right temporal area
flashback to parkland hospital emergency room on that day in
the doctors work on the president
the wounds on the back of his head are evident but will change later in the autopsy
he is placed in a bronze casket
not one of the civilian doctors who examined the president at parkland hospital regarded his throat wound as anything but a wound of entry
the doctors found no wounds of entry in the back of the head
but the body was then illegally moved to washington for the autopsy
cut to the secret service team preparing to wheel the casket out
the dallas medical examiner dr
rose backed by a justice of the peace bars the way
a furious wrestling match ensues
texas law sir requires the autopsy be done here
youre not taking him with you
sonofabitch youre not telling me what to do
get the hell outta the way
the secret service agents put the doctor and judge up against the wall at gunpoint and sweep out of the hospital
because when a coup detat has occurred theres a big difference between an autopsy performed by civilian doctors and one by military doctors working for the government
flashback to love field the same day
we see air force one taking off and a photo of l
being sworn in
the departure of air force one from love field that friday afternoon was not so much a takeoff as it was a getaway with the newly sworn in president
objection your honor
on the plane of course lee harvey oswalds guilt was announced by the white house situation room to the passengers before any kind of investigation had started
the lone nut solution is in place
garrison would you please bottle the acid
flashback to the bethesda autopsy room in
the room is crammed with military officers secret service men and at the center three intimidated doctors
pictures are being taken as they remove bullet fragments
the three bethesda naval hospital doctors picked by the military left something to be desired inasmuch as none of them had experience with combat gunfire wounds
through their autopsy we have been able to justify eight wounds three to kennedy five to connally from just two bullets one of these bullets the magic bullet
cut to jim in court with a series of drawings indicating with arrows entry and exit wounds to kennedys neck and head
finck is on the stand erect very precise and irritated
colonel finck are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck
i was told that the family wanted examination of the head
as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death was it not
i had the cause of death
your honor i would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question
why did colonel finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck
well i heard dr
humes stating that he said
flashback to bethesda autopsy room
whos in charge here
i dont remember his name
you must understand it was quite crowded and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the president who is dead you dont look
around too much to ask people for their names and who they are
but you were a qualified pathologist
was this army general a qualified pathologist
but you took his orders
he was directing the autopsy
no because there were others
there were admirals
there were admirals
oh yes there were admirals and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the army you just follow orders and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told
as i recall it was admiral kenney the surgeon general of the navy we were specifically told not to discuss the case
in bethesda scene gentlemen what youve seen in this room is intensely private to the kennedy family and it is not our business to
jim turns away from the jury
his point is made
finck is no longer on the stand
in addition to which the chief pathologist commander humes by his own admission voluntarily burned his autopsy notes never released the autopsy photos to the public president johnson ordered the
blood soaked limousine filled with bullet holes and clues to be immediately washed and rebuilt sent john connallys bloody suit right to the cleaners and when my office finally got a court order to examine president kennedys brain in the national archives in the hopes of finding from what direction the bullets came we were told by the government the presidents brain had disappeared
theres a pause and then a murmur from the court
jim is on a roll and knows it
the faces in the courtroom are with him absorbed horrified
the law students are still there they have been since day one
but it is lizs interest that touches him the most
so what really happened that day
lets just for a moment speculate shall we
we have the epileptic seizure around p
distracting the police making it easier for the shooters to move into their places
the epileptic later vanished never checking into the hospital
the a team gets on the th floor of the book depository
flashback to the book depository
a shooter and two spotters dressed as working men move into the oswald spot
one spotter produces the mannlicher carcano
they were refurbishing the floors in the depository that week which allowed unknown workmen in and out of the building
the men move quickly into position just minutes before the shooting
the camera takes the shooters point of view we see down the street through a scope
his spotter wears a radio earpiece
the second spotter is working out of the southeast window
the second spotter is probably calling all the shots on a radio to the two other teams
he as the best overall view the god spot
inside the dal tex building a shooter and a spotter dressed as air conditioning men move into a small second story textile storage room
b team one rifleman and one spotter with a headset with access to the building moves into a low floor of the dal tex building
at the picket fence a shooter in a dallas police uniform moves into place aiming up elm street
his spotter has a radio to his ear
another man in a secret service suit moves further down the fence
the third team the c team moves in behind the picket fence above the grassy knoll where the shooter and the spotter are first seen by the late lee bowers
in the watchtower of the railyard
they have the best position of all
kennedy is close and on a flat low trajectory
part of this team is a coordinator whos flashed security credentials at several people chasing them out of the parking lot area
an agent in tie and suit moves on the underpass keeping an eye out
in the crowd on elm street we catch brief glimpses of the umbrella man and the cuban neither of them watching kennedy both looking around to their teams
there is a third man heavyset in a construction helmet
probably two to three more men are down in the crowd on elm
ten to twelve men
three teams three shooters
the triangulation of fire clay shaw and david ferrie discussed two months before
theyve walked the plaza they know every inch
theyve calibrated their sights practiced on moving targets
its going to be a turkey shoot
kennedys motorcade makes the turn from main onto houston
waves and turns in slow motion
six witnesses see two gunmen on the sixth floor of the depository moving around
some of them think theyre policemen with rifles
from houston street we look up at the sixth floor of the book depository and see the shooter moving around
arnold rowland points him out to his wife
under probably a security agent
in the dallas county jail johnny powell is one of many convicts housed on the sixth floor the same height as the men in the book depository
we look across to the depository through cell bars
johnny and various cell mates are watching two men in the sixth floor of the depository
john powell a prisoner on the sixth floor of the dallas county jail sees them
under quite a few of us saw them
everybody was hollering and yelling and that
we thought is was security guys
they dont shoot him coming up houston which is the easiest shot for a single shooter in the book depository but they wait till he gets to the killing zone
between three rifles
kennedy makes the final turn from houston onto elm slowing down to some miles per hour
all the shooters tighten taking aim
its a tense moment
the shooters across dealey plaza tighten taking their aim across their sights
waiting for the radio to say green green
or abort abort
the camera is on kennedy waving
a montage follows all the faces in the square that weve introduced in the movie now appear one after the other watching the killers the man with the umbrella the
newman family mary moorman photographing jean hill abraham zapruder filming it s
holland patrolman harkness
intercut with the zapruder and nix films on j
in the final seconds coming abreast of the stemmons freeway sign
the first shot rings out
cut to the dal tex shooter firing
we see the back of kennedys through his gun sight
kennedy stand in reacts in the zapruder film
sounding like a backfire it misses completely
frame kennedy stops waving as he hears something
connally turns his head slightly to the right
everything goes off very fast now
repeating intercuts are slowed down with shots of kennedy reacting in the zapruder film
frame the second shot hits kennedy in the throat from the front
frame the president emerging from the road sign
he obviously has been hit raising his arms to his throat
cut to the picket fence shooter hitting him from the fence
we see kennedy stand in from the point of view of his telescopic sight
in the zapruder film we see kennedy clutch his throat
frame the third shot the president has been hit in the back drawing him downward and forward
connally you will notice shows no signs at all of being hit
he is visibly holding his stetson which is impossible if his wrist has been shattered
cut to the dal tex shooter
we see kennedy from his point of view and the zapruder film in slow motion
connallys turning now here
the fourth shot misses kennedy and takes connally in the back
this is the key shot that proves two rifles from the rear
seconds after the third shot and we know no manual bolt action rifle can be recycled in that time
connally is hit his mouth drops he yells out my god theyre going to kill us all
cut to the sixth floor shooter firing rapidly and missing kennedy but hitting connally stand in
the umbrella man is signalling hes not dead
james tague down at the underpass is hit sometime now by another shot that misses
cut to the umbrella man pumping his umbrella
the cuban is looking off
the man on the curb in the construction helmet is looking not at j
but up at the book depository
the car brakes
the fifth and fatal shot frame takes kennedy in the head from the front
cut to the picket fence shooter
we see j
from his point of view
he fires and then we see kennedy in the zapruder film flying backwards and to his left in a ferocious conclusive spray of blood and brain tissue
we repeat the shot
this is the key shot
watch it again
the president going back to his left
shot from the front and right
totally inconsistent with the shot from the depository
back and two the left
he repeats it like a mantra
back and to the left
back and to the left
kennedys car speeds off
jackie is like a crawling animal in a pillbox hat on the back of the car
the people on the other side of the underpass wave innocently as the car speeds through with its horrifying contents
pigeons fly off the rooftop of the book depository
what happens then
the shooters quickly disassemble their various weapons all except the oswald rifle
cut to sixth floor spotter dumping the mannlicher carcano in a corner as he leaves
and then to the dal tex spotter and shooter who break down the gun and move out
and then to the spotter with the fence shooter who quickly breaks down the weapon throwing it in the trunk of a car parked at the fence
he walks away
the fence shooter dressed as a policeman blends with the crowd
cut to the umbrella man and the cuban sitting quietly together on the north side of the curb of elm street
cut to stunned confused people in the crowd some lying on the ground some running for the grassy knoll
back in the courtroom patrolman joe smith is on the stand
patrolman joe smith rushed into the parking lot behind the fence
he smelled gunpowder
flashback to the picket fence area where with his gun drawn smith rushes across to a man standing by a car who reacts quickly producing credentials
he is one of the hoboes
theres a strange moment when the camera moves from smiths eyes to the mans fingernails
the character produces credentials from his pocket which showed him to be secret service
so i accepted that and let him go and continued our search
but i regretted it cause this guy looked like an auto mechanic
he had on a sports shirt and pants but he had dirty fingernails
afterwards it didnt ring true but at the time we were so pressed for time
yet all secret servicemen in dallas that day are accounted for
none were on foot in dealey plaza before or after the shooting till dallas secret service chief forrest sorrels returned at
back in the courtroom liz is totally absorbed
jim exchanges looks with her
the camera movies in for a close up of jim
pausing for effect what else was going on in dealey plaza that day
at least other individuals were taken into custody by dallas police
no records of their arrests
men acting like hoboes were being pulled off trains marched through dealey plaza photographed and yet there is no records of their arrests
flashback to the three hoboes being arrested
marching across dealey plaza
the hoboes look familiar now
men identifying themselves as secret service agents were all over the place
but who was impersonating them
flashback to men in suits ties and hats moving people out of the parking lot area
turning a policeman back
flashback to the cuban putting away a radio and the umbrella man who now rise and leave the area in opposite directions
and where was lee oswald
probably in the second floor snack room
eddie piper and william shelly saw oswald eating lunch in the first floor lunch room around twelve
around on her way out of the building to see the motorcade secretary carolyn arnold saw oswald in the second floor snack room where he said he went for a
in the second floor lunchroom of the book depository we see carolyn arnold a pregnant secretary crossing past oswald who is in a booth
he was sitting in one of the booths on the right hand side of the room
he was alone as usual and appeared to be having lunch
i did not speak to him but i recognized clearly
i remember it was or later
it coulda been five minutes before the assassination i dont exactly remember
i was pregnant and i had a craving for a glass of water
on the sixth floor of the depository bonnie ray williams is eating a chicken lunch alone
at the same time bonnie ray williams is supposedly eating his chicken lunch on the sixth floor at least until maybe
he sees nobody
on the street arnold rowland and his wife look up at the sixth floor windows and we see from their point of view two shadowy figures
down on the street arnold rowland was seeing two men in the sixth floor windows
presumably after bonnie ray williams finished his lunch and left
we see footage of j
coming up houston waving
oswald walks into the second floor lunchroom as policeman marrion baker runs in gun at his side
he is about feet from oswald
roy truly the superintendent runs in a moment later
kennedy was running five minutes late for his appointment with death
he was due at
if oswald was the assassin he was certainly pretty non chalant about getting himself into position
later he told dallas police he was standing in the second floor snackroom
probably told to wait there for a phone call by his handler
the phones were in the adjacent and empty second floor offices but the call never came
a maximum seconds after kennedy is shot patrolman marrion baker runs into oswald in that second story lunchroom
to truly do you know this man
is he an employee
yes he is
as baker moves on the presidents been shot
oswald reacts as if hearing it for the first time
truly and baker continue running up the stairs
oswald proceeds to get a coke and continues out of the room
cut to the sixth floor where we see oswald as the shooter
after firing he runs full speed for the stairs stashing the rifle on the other side of the loft
our camera follows him roughly down stairs we hear the loud sound of his shoes banging on the hollow wood to the lunchroom where patrolman baker and superintendent truly run
then they start to repeat the same action as seen in the previous scene
but what the warren report would have us believe is that after firing bolt action shots in
seconds oswald then leaves three cartridges neatly side by side in the firing nest wipes the rifle clear of fingerprints stashes the rifle on the other side of the loft
sprints down five flights of stairs past witnesses victoria adams and sandra styles who never see him and then shows up cool and calm on the second floor in front of patrolman baker all this within a maximum seconds of the shooting
is he out of breath
according to baker absolutely not
cut to the second floor
oswald ambles past mrs
reid a secretary in the second floor office on his way out coke bottle in hand and wearing his usual dreamy look
theres a lingering close up on his face
assuming he is the sole assassin oswald is now free to escape from the building
the longer he delays the more chance the building will be sealed by the police
is he guilty
does he walk out the nearest staircase
no he buys a coke and at a slow pace spotted by mrs
reid in the second floor office he strolls out the more distant front exit where the cops start to gather
outside we see oswald stroll out the door of the book depository into the crowd
he heads for the bus stop to the east
oddly considering three shots are supposed to have come from there nobody seals the depository for ten more minutes
oswald slips out as do several other employees
of course when he realized something had gone wrong and the president really had been shot he knew there was a problem
he may even have known he was the patsy
an intuition maybe the president killed in spite of his warning
the phone call that never came
perhaps fear now came to lee oswald
he wasnt going to stand around for roll call
back in the courtroom jim continues speaking the story gets pretty confusing now more twists in it than a watersnake
richard carr says he saw four men take off from the book depository in a rambler that possibly belongs to janet williams
deputy roger craig says two men picked up oswald in the same rambler a few minutes later
other people say oswald took a bus out of there and then because he was stuck in traffic he hopped a cab to his rooming house in oak cliff
flashback to oswalds boarding house
oswald enters his room passing earlene roberts the heavyset white housekeeper
we must assume he wanted to get back in touch with his intell team probably at a safehouse or at the texas theatre but how could he be sure
he didnt know who to trust anymore
watching tv my god did you see that mr
a man shot the president
the camera closes in on oswalds perplexed face
earlene peeks out the shades as she hears two short honks on a horn
outside is a black police car driven by tippit
also in the car is the fence shooter dressed as a dallas policeman
the car drives by honks twice waits then moves away
during this visual we see the fence shooter changing his uniform into civilian clothes
oswald returns to this rooming house around p
half hour after the assassination puts on his jacket grabs his
revolver leaves at
earlene roberts the housekeeper says she heard two beeps on a car horn and two uniformed cops pulled up to the house while oswald was in his room like it
was a signal or something
officer tippit is shot between and about a mile away
though no one actually saw him walking or jogging the government says oswald covered that distance
incidentally that walk if he did it is in a straight line toward jack rubys house
giving the government the benefit of the doubt oswald would have had to jog a mile in six to eleven minutes and commit the murder then reverse direction and walk
of a mile to the texas theatre and arrive sometime before
thats some walking
on a street oswald walks alone fast
a police car pulls up alongside him on th street
oswald leans on the passenger side of the window
officer tippit suspicious gets out to question him
oswald pulls his
revolver and shoots him down in the street with shots
its also a useful conclusion
after all why else would oswald kill officer tippit unless he just shot the president and feared arrest
not one credible witness could identify oswald as tippits killer
domingo benavides hidden in his truck only a few yards away watches as another unidentified man not seen before shoots and walks away
domingo benavides the closest witness to the shooting refused to identify oswald as the killer and was never taken to a lineup
we see acquilla clemons a black woman looking on
she watches as two men kill tippit
one of them resembles the fence shooter
the other one is a mystery figure seen before in the fringes
the men walk off quickly in opposite directions
we notice a policemans uniform hanging in the back seat of tippits car
acquilla clemons saw the killer with another man and says they went off in separate directions
clemons was never taken to lineup or to the warren commission
frank wright who saw the killer run away stated flatly that the killer was not lee oswald
oswald is found with a
tippit is killed with a automatic
at the scene of the crime officer j
poe marks the shells with his initials to record the chain of evidence
cut to policeman poe marking the bullets
those initials are not on the three cartridge cases which the warren commission presents to him
on a dallas avenue near the texas theatre oswald moves along spooked
police cars roar by with sirens blaring
johnny brewer in a shoestore spots him and follows him
oswald is next seen by shoe salesman johnny brewer lurking along jefferson avenue
oswald is scared
he begins to realize the full implications of this thing
he goes into the texas theatre possibly his prearranged meeting point but though he has in his pocket he does not buy the cent ticket
brewer has the cashier call the police
outside the texas theatre oswald walks past the cashier who is out on the sidewalk watching the police cars go by
a double feature is playing cry of battle with van heflin and war is hell
he goes in
cut to officers arriving at the theatre in a fleet of patrol cars
in response to the cashiers call at least thirty officers in a fleet of patrol cars descend on the movie theatre
this has to be the most remarkable example of police intuition since the reichstag fire
i dont buy it
they knew someone knew oswald was going to be there
in fact as early as only minutes after the assassination the police radio put out a description matching oswalds size and build
brewer says the man was wearing a jacket but the police say the man who shot tippit left his jacket behind
butch burroughs theatre manager says oswald bought some popcorn from him at the time of the tippit slaying
burroughs and witness bernard haire also said there was an oswald look alike taken from the theatre
perhaps it was he who sneaked into the theatre just after
inside the theatre cry of battle is on the screen
twelve to fourteen spectators sit scattered between the balcony and ground floor
brewer leads the officers onto the stage and the lights come on
he points to oswald
in any case brewer helpfully leads the cops into the theatre and from the stage points oswald out
the cops advance on oswald who jumps up as if expecting to be shot
this is it
kill the president will you
scared oswald takes a swing at a policeman
he pulls out his gun
the officers close in on him from the rear and front
a wrestling and shoving match ensues
one officer gets a chokehold on oswald and another one hits him
the cops have their man
it was already been decided in washington
outside the theatre oswald his eye blackened is led out by the phalanx of officers
they are surrounded by an angry crowd
best himmlers right hand man in the gestapo once said as long as the police carries out the will of the leadership it is acting legally
that mindset allowed for political murders in the weimar republic of where the courts were controlled and the guilty acquitted
oswald mustve felt like josef k in kafkas the trial
he was never told the reason of his arrest he does not know the unseen forces ranging against him he cries out his outrage in the police lineup just like
josef k excoriates the judge for not being told the charges against him
but the state is deaf
the quarry is caught
by the time he is brought from the theatre a large crowd is waiting to scream at him
by the time he reaches police headquarters he is booked for murdering tippit
at the dallas police station dallas police captain will fritz takes a call from a high official in washington
in the background we notice lee oswald continuing to be questioned by federal agents
we hear johnsons distinctive texas drawl but we never see him
no legal counsel is provided
no record made of the long questioning
howdy there capn
thanks for taking care of us down in dallas
lady bird and i will always be grateful
thank you mr
were doing our best
capn i know youre working like a hound dog down there to get this mess wrapped up but i gotta tell you theres too much confusion coming out of dallas
the tvs and the papers are full of rumour bout conspiracies
two gunmen two rifles the russkies done it the cubans done it that kinda loose talk its carin the shit outta people bubba
this thing could lead us into a war that could cost million lives
we got to showem we got this thing under control
no question no doubts for the good of our country
you hear me
capn you got your man the investigations over thats what people want to hear
the camera closes in on oswald in the background
he turns to an unseen deputy sad
now everyone will know who i am
by the time the sun rose the next morning he is booked for murdering the president
the whole country fueled by the media assumes hes guilty
in an underground police garage we see jack ruby being allowed in via an interior staircase by his police contact
he moves towards the outer edge of reporters nervous
oswald comes out with his two guards
we see a repeat of the assassination in stop time
rubys eyes oswalds
do they recognize each other
under the guise of a patriotic nightclub owner out to spare jackie kennedy from having to testify at a trial jack ruby is shown into the underground garage by one
of his inside men on the dallas police force and when hes ready oswald is brought out like a sacrificial lamb and nicely disposed of as an enemy of the people
by early sunday afternoon the autopsy has been completed on him
who grieves for lee harvey oswald
buried in a cheap grave under the name oswald
we see oswald dying on the floor of the police station
a paramedic pushes in and starts administering artificial respiration which only aggravates the internal hemorrhaging
at a texas cemetery oswalds mother weeps
oswald is buried with a few people present but there are no details no dates
we see marina whisked out by agents
cut to kennedys funeral which in contrast attracts thousands of mourners
within minutes false statements and press leaks about lee oswald circulate the globe
flashback to x reading about it in the new zealand airport and then back to the courtroom in
the official legend is created and the media takes it from there
the glitter of official lies and the epic splendor of the thought numbing funeral of j
confuse the eye and confound the understanding
hitler always said the bigger the lie the more people will believe it
lee oswald a crazed lonely man who wanted attention and got it by killing a president was only the first in a long line of patsies
in later years bobby kennedy and martin luther king men whose commitment to change and to peace would make them dangerous to men who are committed to war would follow
also killed by such lonely crazed men who remove our guilt by making murder a meaningless act of a loner
we have all become hamlets in our country children of a slain father leader whose killers still possess the throne
the ghost of john f
kennedy confronts us with the secret murder at the heart of the american dream
he forces on us the appalling questions of what is our constitution made
what is our citizenship and more our lives worth
what is the future of a democracy where a president can be assassinated under conspicuously suspicious circumstances while the machinery of legal action scarcely trembles
how many political murders disguised as heart attacks cancer suicides airplane and car crashes drug overdoses will occur before they are exposed for what they are
liz watches moved
susie al and numa are also there for the summation
even lou ivon has come back to support his friend
treason doth never prosper wrote an english poet whats the reason
for if it prosper none dare call it treason
the generals who sent dreyfus to devils island were among the most honorable men in france the men who killed caesar were among the most honorable men in rome
and the men who killed kennedy no doubt were honorable men
i believe we have reached a time in our country similar to what life mustve been like under hitler in the s except we dont realize it because fascism in
our country takes the benign disguise of liberal democracy
there wont be such familiar signs as swastikas
we wont build dachaus and auschwitzes
were not going to wake up one morning and suddenly find ourselves in gray uniforms goose stepping off to work
fascism will come huey long once said
in the name of anti fascism it will come in the name of your security they call it national security it will come with the mass media manipulating a clever
concentration camp of the mind
the super state will provide you tranquility above the truth the super state will make you believe you are living in the best of all possible worlds and in order
to do so will rewrite history as it sees fit
george orwells ministry of truth warned us who controls the past controls the future
the camera follows jim around the courtroom
the american people have yet to see the zapruder film
the american people have yet to see the real photographs and x rays of the autopsy
there are hundreds of documents that could help prove this conspiracy
why have they been withheld or burned by the government
each time my office or you the people have asked those questions demanded crucial evidence the answer from on high has been national security
what kind of national security do we have when we have been robbed of our leaders
who determines our national security
what national security permits the removal of fundamental power from the hands of the american people and validates the ascendancy of invisible government in the united states
that kind of national security gentlemen of the jury is when it smells like it feels like it and looks like it you call it what it is its fascism
i submit to you that what took place on november was a coup detat
its most direct and tragic result was a reversal of president kennedys commitment to withdraw from vietnam
war is the biggest business in america worth billion a year
the president was murdered by a conspiracy planned in advance at the highest levels of the united states government and carried out by fanatical and disciplined cold warriors in the
pentagon and cias covert operations apparatus among them clay shaw here before you
it was a public execution and it was covered up by like minded individuals in the dallas police department the secret service the fbi and the white house all the
way up to and including j
edgar hoover and lyndon johnson whom i consider accomplices after the fact
the camera holds on onlookers shuffling and murmuring
clay shaw smirks smoking his cigarette
the very grandiosity of the charge works in his favor
jim is falling apart from built up strain and fatigue
he looks over at liz gathering his spirit
there is a very simple way to determine if i am being paranoid here
laughter lets ask the two men who have profited the most from the assassination your former president lyndon baines johnson and your new president richard nixon to release cia documents
pertaining to lee oswald and jack ruby or the secret cia memo on oswalds activities in russia that was destroyed while being photocopied
all these documents are yours the peoples property you pay for it but because the government considers you children who might be too disturbed to face this reality because you
might lynch those involved you cannot see these documents for another years
im in my s so ill have shuffled off this mortal coil by then but im already telling my year old son to keep himself physically fit so that one
glorious september morning in he can walk into the national archives and find out what the cia and the fbi knew
they may even push it back then
it may become a generational affair with questions passed down from father to son mother to daughter in the manner of the ancient runic bards
someday somewhere someone might find out the damned truth
or we might just build ourselves a new government like the declaration of independence says we should do when the old one aint working maybe a little farther out west
he approaches the jury
an american naturalist wrote a patriot must always be ready to defend his country against its government
well id hate to be in your shoes today
you have a lot to think about
going back to when we were children i think most of us in this courtroom thought that justice came into being automatically that virtue was its own reward that good
would triumph over evil
but as we get older we know that this just isnt true
the frontier is where a man faces a fact
individual human beings have to create justice and this is not easy because truth often presents a threat to power and we have to fight power often at great risk
people like julia ann mercer s
holland lee bowers jean hill and willie okeefe have come forward and taken that risk
he produces a stack of letters i have here some in these letters sent to my office from all over the country quarters dimes dollar bills from housewives plumbers car
salesmen teachers invalids
these are the people who cannot afford to send money but do these are the ones who drive the cabs who nurse in the hospitals who see their kids go
because they care because they want to know the truth because they want their country back because it belongs to us the people as long as the people got the
guts to fight for what they believe in
the truth is the most important value we have because if the truth does not endure if the government murders truth if you cannot respect the hearts of these people
shaking the letters then this is no longer the country in which we were born in and this is not the country i want to die in
and this was never more true than for john f
kennedy whose murder was probably the most terrible moment in the history of our country
you the people you the jury system in sitting in judgement on clay shaw represent the hope of humanity against government power
in discharging your duty in bringing the first conviction in this house of cards against clay shaw ask not what your country can do for you but what you can
do for your country
do not forget your young president who forfeited his life
show the world this is still a government of the people for the people and by the people
nothing as long as you live will ever be more important
he stares into the camera its up to you
he returns to the table and sits
the courtroom is still
cut to later in the same courtroom
the jury files in having reached a verdict
jim prepared sits with his staff and liz
the jury foreman enters the courtroom
we find clay shaw
not guilty on all counts
theres jubilation and commotion in the court
shaw stands happily shaking hands all over
members of the press run for the phones
in the corridor outside the courtroom the press interviews the jury foreman
we believe there was a conspiracy but whether clay shaw was a part of it is another kettle of fish
the camera moves to jim who walks out past the banks of reporters
tv lights are in his face
liz is by his side
garrison the american media is reporting this as a full vindication of the warren commission do you
i think all it proves is you cannot run a trial even questioning the intelligence operations of the government in the light of day
we understand that the times picayune will call for your resignation unfit to hold office
youve ruined clay shaws reputation are you going to resign
im gonna run again
and im gonna win
thank you very much
if it takes me years to nail every one of the assassins then i will continue this investigation for years
i owe that not only to jack kennedy but to my country
he and liz squeeze hands as they walk on
jim waits on the same park bench as earlier in the film overlooking the mall or the lincoln monument
as x walks up a little grayer a little more stooped wearing ill fitting civilian clothes
well thanks for coming
you didnt get that break you needed but you went as far as any man could bubba
he sits next to jim what can i do for you
just speculating i guess
how do you think it started
i think it started in the wind
money arms big oil pentagon people contractors bankers politicians like l
were committed to a war in southeast asia
as early as they knew kennedy was going to change things
he was not going to war in southeast asia
probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere houston new york hell maybe bonn germany
who knows its international now
cut to a new york lunch club or executive dining room
from the window we have a towering view of the city
four men in their s to s old men rich men talk at a quiet table
their figures are shadowy and we overhear their conversation obliquely across faces flared out by sun bouncing off the skyscraper window
one worried sonofabitch with a few million dollars turns to the others
with a few million dollars
and says something pretty direct like
the sonofabitch is gonna get re elected by a bigger vote than ever in
its gonna be worse than roosevelt
the country wont survive as we know it
i agree bob it cant go on
he looks to man and bobby in
somethings got to be done
looks pass among them
theres a pause and then
hes gotta go lou
the elections gotta be stopped
there is a breathless moment with the thought in the air
i talk to a lot of people
i know im not the only one thinking this
whats the feeling in washington jack
flashback to the pentagon in
so calls are made
down to washington
all over the world
they start talking about it
a few people here there
just conversations nothing more
we see a general meeting with another general
generals admirals cia people and probably some people on the inside of kennedys staff young brilliant judases ready to go to war in southeast asia
flashback to the white house
a general talks to one of kennedys staff a bespectacled bright young harvard type
and maybe a vice president getting separate memos from vietnam eager to get his backers the billions of dollars in contracts for southeast asia
in a white house office lyndon johnson meets with a cabinet member a contractor and two military men
kennedy like caesar is surrounded with enemies
something is underway but it has no face
yet everyone in the loop knows
the camera shows washington d
buildings from strange angles
the feeling is still weird angled alien
the buildings are twisted
money is at stake
a hundred billion
the kennedy brothers target voting districts for defense dollars
they give tfx fighter contracts only to the counties that are going to make a difference in
these people fight back
one day another call is made
in a pentagon office a man in civilian clothing is on the phone his back to the screen
this is mr
y xs superior officer
shadows pervade the room
an unshuttered window overlooks the potomac river and the white house
maybe to somebody like my superior whos been running the mongoose program out of florida and who has no love for kennedy
bill were going
we need your help
no one has said he must die theres been no vote theres nothing on paper theres no one to blame
its as old as the crucifixion the mafia firing squad one blank no ones guilty because everyone in the power structure who knows anything has a plausible deniability
there are no compromising connections except at the most secret point
but whats paramount is that it must succeed
no matter how many die how much it costs the perpetrators must be on the winning side and never subject to prosecution for anything by anyone
that is a coup detat
into phone when
in the fall
probably in the south
we want you to come up with a plan
hes done it before
lumumba in the congo trujillo the dominican republic hes working on castro
no big deal
in september kennedy announces the texas trip
at that moment second oswalds start popping up all over dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket
y flies in the assassins maybe from the special camp we keep outside athens greece pros maybe some locals cubans maria hire separate teams
does it really matter who shot from what rooftop
part of the scenery
the assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone
any chance of one of them confessing someday
dont think so
when they start to drool they get rid of em
these guys are proud of what they did
they did dealey plaza
they took out the president of the united states
and they served their country doing it
in present and your general
got promoted to two stars but he was never military you know always cia
went to vietnam lost his credibility when we got beat over there retired lives in virginia
i say hello to him when i see him at the supermarket
ever ask him
you never ask a spook a question
hell never give you a straight answer
general y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more
does it matter
but an interesting thing he was there that day in dealey plaza
you know how i know
jim shakes his head that picture of yours
you never looked deep enough
flashback to one of the hobo pictures
next to the freight entrance of the book depository y in a dark suit is nonchalantly walking past the hoboes his back to us
the camera closes in on y
i knew the man years
the way he walked
arms at his side military the stoop the haircut the twisted left hand the large class ring
what was he doing there
if anyone had asked him hed probably say protection but ill tell you i think he was giving some kind of okay signal to those hoboes theyre about to get
booked and hes telling em its gonna be okay theyre covered
and in fact they were you never heard of them again
the whole thing
its like it never happened
it never did
he smiles tartly just think
what happened to our country
to the world
because of that murder
vietnam racial conflict breakdown of law drugs thought control guilt assassinations secret government fear of the frontier
i keep thinking of that day tuesday the th the day after they buried kennedy l
was signing the memorandum on vietnam with ambassador lodge
flashback to the white house
johnson sits across the shadowed room with lodge and others
his texas drawl rises and falls
he signs something unseen
gentlemen i want you to know im not going to let vietnam go the way china did
im personally committed
im not going to take one soldier out of there til they know we mean business in asia
he pauses you just get me elected and ill give you your damned war
and that was the day vietnam started
cut to documentary footage of u
marines arriving in full force on the beaches of danang march

in victor marchetti former executive assistant to the cias deputy director stated that during high level cia meetings during shaws trial in cia director richard helms disclosed that clay shaw

shaw received agency help at his trial

clay shaw died in of supposed lung cancer
no autopsy was allowed
william sullivan assistant director of the fbi died in the early morning hours of november when he was mistaken for a deer in an open field in new hampshire
