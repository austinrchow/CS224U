written by henry bean mark jacobson final shooting script and god said to abraham take your son your only son whom you love isaac and go into the land of
moriah and offer him there for a sacrifice upon a mountain that i will show you
a run down place
a dozen year old boys sit at old fashioned desks
these are not hasidim but orthodox jews normal american kids in yarmulkes
the teacher rav zingesser is young overweight acnescarred good humored
and why did the holy one blessed be he do this
why did he ask abraham to sacrifice his only son whom he loved
two boys off to one side avi a smart tough brownnose and danny the eternal dissident argue under their breath
isaac wasnt his only son
ishmael was his son too
the only son he loved
oh they only kill them when they love them
up front answering zingesser it was a test of abrahams faith
of his devotion to god
its not about abrahams faith
its about gods power
god says you know how powerful i am
i can make you do anything i want no matter how stupid
even kill your own son
because im everything youre nothing
danny looks around at his classmates nerds wankers nose pickers
two kids in back furtively read the racing form under their desks
he hates them for their indifference as much as he despises stuarts piety or avis ass kissing
but danny if hashem is everything and we are nothing how are we to judge his actions
we have free will and intelligence which god allegedly gave us
anyway god never lets abraham kill isaac
he provides the ram so that personally i think thats a lie
i think he did kill him
based on what
theres midrash supporting this
my father read a book by shalom spiegel that isaac actually died and was reborn
no one follows that midrash
i do i follow it
but okay say god provided the ram
once abraham raised the knife in his heart it was as if hed killed him
he could never forget that
and neither could isaac
look at him hes traumatized hes a putz for the rest of his life
by the end he cant tell jacob from esau
the kids laugh
zingesser cracks a ruler against a desk
watch your language
rising impassioned i think the whole jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on mt
moriah and we still live in terror
fear of god is the beginning of wisdom
fear of god makes you afraid of everything
all the jews are good at is being afraid
and being sacrificed
crack crack crack
even the guys with the sports pages are shocked by that one
dont you believe in god
im the only one here who does believe
you say hes mysterious yet merciful
i see him for the power drunk madman he is
and were supposed to worship such a deity
i say never
i say the ruler has been cracking from power drunk on
now zingesser grabs danny yanks him out of his chair
avi ask rabbi springer to come remove danny from the class
avi rises grinning as
danny struggles wildly to get free
and you if you had come out of egypt you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the golden calf
then let him destroy me now
let him crush me like the conceited bully he is
to the ceiling go ahead
here i am
the class sits frozen in terror waiting for god to kill danny
but nothing happens
danny runs down the steps alone
danny walking home alone
he sees two kids older tougher blonder coming toward him
he slips off his yarmulke and slants across the street
the kids slant that way
he hears a rumbling looks up at an elevated train entering a station
he runs up the steps toward the shrieking train
the train passes above used car lots discount furniture stores residential side streets
finally pulls into a station
the doors open
people file on the camera letting them go by until it spots a tall thin college student in a yarmulke
danny grown up
pan with him as he sits opens an organic chemistry text
the doors close
the train starts up but the jewish boy hardly notices he is already reading
he sways with the motion of the car half hidden by other passengers
we realize he is being watched
reverse angle another young man standing a suede head his hair cut so short its like a fine fabric
suede heads pov the jewish boy pushes his glasses back up his nose wipes the nose with a handkerchief puts the handkerchief away and all the time his eyes have
not left the page
suede head steps between passengers and stands directly over the jewish boy
he looks down at the yarmulke pinned to the stiff wavy hair at the oversized shirt collar scrawny neck prominent adams apple pimples dandruff ingrown facial hair
he steps closer crowding the boys knees
the boy shifts a little without looking up
subtly but relentlessly suede head pursues him along the bench until unable to slide farther the boy flattens his legs against the seat
suede head presses into the boys knees
the boy accidentally bumps a businessman to suede heads left
the man late s wall street journal african american looks from the boy to suede head and understands at once what is going on
suede head stares right back and the businessman returns to his paper
suede head eases him aside and steps on the boys shoe
the wingtip wiggles back and forth finally working free
the boy still hasnt looked up
swaying locked in a strange silent intimacy
suede head forces the boy into ever more contorted postures increasingly ridiculous denials of what is happening
and the boy not only never stops reading the chemistry text he keeps highlighting relevant passages
the train slows
the boy closes the book caps the highlighter gathers his things and manages to stand up wriggling awkwardly around suede head
the doors open he gets off
looking up a long escalator the jewish boy riding down toward us
suede head arrives on the run at the top races down a flight of stairs vaults the bannister slides down a metal slope
lands on his feet and comes to stand at the foot of the escalator
the boy rides inexorably down
at the bottom he tries to go around suede head who blocks this way then another driving him into a corner
the boy realizes he has nowhere to go finally turns to face his tormentor
their eyes meet for the first time
he is actually bigger than suede head but not nearly as strong
he wont fight is simply acknowledging what he can no longer deny
there is even an odd relief that disgusts suede head more than all the rest
he slaps him in the face
he stumbles backward
as suede head goes to hit him again the boy holds his books in front of him
suede head punches the books straight into his face
the boy falls curls into a fetal position
suede head kicks him
get the fuck up
he wont budge
suede head punches him repeatedly until he hears voices approaching
he runs back up the stairs to the train and only as we follow him do we realize that he is our protagonist
this is danny grown up
like his brain the room is at once crowded and tidy and has so far as we can see neither windows nor doors
shelves of books cds magazines videotapes loom over a neatly made bed
danny in briefs and boots is lifting weights
the phone rings
a machine picks up no outgoing message only a beep
then is this working
im trying to reach danny balint
danny its vicki we met at happy jacks last month
he keeps doing curls
i was hoping maybe we could
get together again
give me a call
she hangs up
a moment later danny finishes the set gasping for air heart pounding muscles throbbing
a radio is playing the news
danny sits at a small desk on the phone and browsing the internet a take out menu beside him
is it completely vegetarian
what do they make the stock from
not chicken youre sure
and no dairy
no no cheese i dont eat cheese
yeah all right
and the tropical fruit shake
over this we see computer screen glimpses of passing phrases he highlights the item about curtis zampf
a tough working class queens bar
men drink in clusters including a group of skinheads
danny takes a place alone at the bar drawing furtive attention from the regulars
when the bartender finally comes over
a strange call for this place
as he waits danny turns and watches the skinheads enough to make them aware of him
the girls watch him too
the skins dont like that
one of them billings seems ready to do something about it
the others try to calm him and when they look back danny has left
he barely touched the drink
the skins are puzzled but one indicates his watch time to go
they gather their stuff
looking out the front of the train as it rushes toward manhattan
a dramatic sky rises above the skyline
the three skins o
carleton billings walk up an east side street
billings is telling a story
so she takes the pants in back where they try them on
and i think fuck it
are you shitting me
right in the store
shes been giving me the eye
so i wait till the owner goes up front
during this o
starts to spray paint a crude swastika onto a bus kiosk
a voice startles them
what are you doing
they jump turn
danny steps out of the shadows
indicating swastika what do you think youre doing
who the fuck are you
coming toward them who am i
who are you you schmucks you cant even make a decent swastika
give me the paint
looks to his friends give it to me
dannys will is stronger o
hands over the spray can
danny shakes it critiques o
gruff but avuncular its too squared off
you got to orient it up and down diamond shaped like this
sprays an excellent swastika the arms go clockwise
hands the can back youre going to curtis zampf me too
they exchange looks how did he know about curtis
where i grew up in south boston twenty years ago when a kid walked down the street everyone knew who he was
grand but threadbare
the skins enter o
like a child carleton like a sardonic adolescent billings like a revolutionary danny like an uncrowned prince
curtis zampf is addressing a dozen or so guests
he is but appears younger with rough good looks longish hair and a leather jacket he seems more like an aging rock star or sexy novelist that a standard issue
if he ran out in front of a car some old mickd yell at him jimmy dunne get back on that sidewalk and stay there
he does the boston irish accent so well everybody laughs
up front we notice the only woman in the room
she is in her s regal beautiful forbidding
her name is lina moebius
the day he graduated high school hed go see his uncle down at the gas works or the priests brother in the shipyard get his apprentice papers eight years later
hed be making
an hour have four kids play ball on sundays in columbus park and when he died the whole townd get drunk and cry over him
the crowd nonunion electricians white taxi drivers unemployed bookkeepers failed academics off duty cops listens quietly
during this a young woman carla appears from the rear of the apartment heading for the kitchen with a coffee cup and a history book
she glances into the living room
today when that kid walks down the street its full of trash and half the faces are black
the shipyards closed all the jobs at the gas works are set asides and by the time he drops out of school he can barely get a job at burger
so he drinks smokes crack and when he hangs himself on the front porch at twenty three the only people at his wake are a couple of buddies and his
the boys father wont find out hes dead till six months later
beat the soul of this country is being destroyed and all the government can offer is free trade mutual funds and ipos
you sound like a leftist
i used to be one
no seriously i called myself an anarchist
i stood up for the oppressed
i opposed state power
dont you still
i oppose the present state because its weak
it has been ever since the left emasculated it over vietnam
but i think the average man is crushed less by accumulated capital than the loss of community or real leadership the personal emptiness he simply cannot fill on his own
matter of fact thats why im a fascist
its the only form of government that addresses our deepest needs
danny who has spotted carla begins to clap a few others join in
danny raises his hand curtis nods to him
what do you think the fascism of the twenty first century will look like
everyone including carla turns to see who asked that
more cultural than political
decentralized nonviolent increasingly mainstream
well see antiabortion anti immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby christian identity types tax resisters and even some libertarians
the crowd seems impressed but restless and bored
what about race
a stirring many share the concern
lina watches closely
this isnt the time for that
murmurs of surprise disappointment
glances at carla i think race is central to everything were talking about
murmurs of agreement spiritual life comes from race
from the blood
without that were no better than the jews
the magic word
the whole room comes alive
whats wrong with the jews
have you read toynbee
nobody reads that stuff anymore
you know jameson
the point is the modern world is a jewish disease
theyre obsessed with abstraction
that stops the conversation
but carla is intrigued here is someone whose mind moves in strange and interesting realms
what would you propose
the questioner is a young man guy danielsen better spoken than the others
danny feels all eyes on him
a tremor of fear and excitement ripples through the room
zampf glances at mrs
moebius she is watching danny intently
that would be a catastrophic mistake
people hate jews
do you agree
they used to
today its not an issue
no but deep down beneath the tolerance they learn on television nothings changed
the very word makes their skin crawl
around the room people nod it isnt even hate really
its more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor
we want to step on it
we dont even know why
its a physical reaction
everyone feels it
which ones would you kill
who are either symbols in themselves or who represent aspects of the jewish character people despise
mutterings whos she
but danny says too obvious
and larry king
is he jewish
leona helmsley michael eisner bob dylan phillip roth ruth bader ginsberg steven spielberg winona ryder beverly sills alvin toffler katherine graham
all of them
but not yet
we dont want celebrity obscuring the issue
which is what
at first no one will know why the victims are being killed
you wouldnt announce it
id say nothing
after two or three people will try to find a pattern
but when it comes out the public will be outraged
it will look like germany all over again
isnt that what we want
germany all over again
only done right this time
the crowd feels a deep atavistic thrill
zampf glances at mrs
without speeches or political parties
a movement without leaders so that no one can stop it
the room is stunned to silence
moebius signals curtis
okay lets break this up for now
to danny could you wait a minute
danny flushed with triumph stands looking down at the city
low i thought we agreed no anti semitism
its exactly what were trying to put behind us
trash the blacks fine but
did you see how they reacted to him
yes of course
but that only plays in this room with people who arent embarrassed to call themselves nazis
if you want a modern fascism you dont mention jews
its a romantic movement curtis
it always has been
lina the thousand year reich barely lasted a decade
do you really want to go down that road again
in america of all places where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues
she looks over at danny now chatting with carla
hes very bright
he speaks well
but what do we do with him
lets find out who he is
you mean who he really is
youre not in school
what do you do
i work at the big boy warehouse
i drive a fork lift
whered you read all that stuff
i just read it
shes beckoning to him
he gives carla a look then crosses to her sitting in a chair she indicates
curtis offers him a drink he declines
carla takes one
and you are
what part of germany are you people from
from the rhineland originally
are you with the fbi mr
or any other law enforcement agency
i was going to ask you the same thing
everyone seems to relax
so what are you really after daniel
do you just want to kill jews or do you have something larger in mind
carla watches silent
danny is aware of both mother and daughter
without blood a willingness to spill it theres no real power no authority
pleased by this curtis is afraid youll marginalize us
were already marginal
we are saying what no one else has the guts to say
isnt that precisely our appeal
so what jew would you kill first
former ambassador to france
managing partner at damon schwarzchild
to lina explaining an investment banking house
the family emigrated from bulgaria when he was eleven
how would you kill him
id have to research it study his routines his security
but ideally on a new york street at midday using a small caliber automatic without a silencer
why no silencer
you want it to be an event
lina stands takes a sherry
everyone else rises with her
danny why dont you come visit us in the country
we have young men with lots of energy and no ideas
maybe you could give them something to think about
bring your friends if you like
as curtis leads him toward the door danny looks around for carla hears womens voices arguing in german
frustrated he goes down the stairs
danny and the other skins walking down the middle of the street drinking beer oblivious to traffic
bring your friends
were not his friends
then i wont bring you
the others laugh
someone honks behind them
billings turns hey bonehead
get your moon ass off the street
billings turns and throws his beer at the voice
a crash breaking glass a screech of brakes car doors open and shut
why dont you go back to rwanda and give each other aids
that does it
the skins run out of frame
sounds of a fight
danny watches indifferent then finally joins in
the skins in a cell
head bloody moaning and vomiting
i cant see
carleton comforts him
billings paces looks at danny sitting against the wall relaxed for the first time
what do you like it here
read mein kampf
hitler had all his best ideas in prison
danny looks up a jailer unlocks the cell
carla appears behind him
danny stops without stepping through the open door
im not leaving without them
the other skins are surprised moved
carla and danny stare at each other
finally she turns to the jailer
can i use a credit card
a mercedes pulls up carla driving
the skins climb out carleton guiding o
who cannot see
he should go to a hospital
billings turns back sees danny still in the car
glances at carla stays in the car well go to the country sometime okay
billings nods grudgingly
the car drives off
fucking danny man
hes an asshole
carla leads danny through the darkened apartment
an old bookcase full of leather bound german volumes
danny opens one marked hofmannsthal
he tries to read a marked passage
und die worte zerfielen mir im munde wie modrige pilze
and the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms
how come so many of the books are in spanish
theyre my fathers
hes from argentina
my mothers family went there during the war
thats where they met
are they still together
hes in a mental institution
hes been there for ten years off and on
is he a nazi
his parents are
he doesnt care about that
whats he care about
they look at each other
theres that gulf between them that they have to cross but theyre not sure how
you think people ever commit suicide out of happiness
why would they
she takes his hand rubs the bruised knuckles
youre not like the others are you
yes i am
basically i am
she leans close whispers
hes surprised but not very
he grabs her wrist twists it
thats too hard
he pulls her out of frame
she starts to say something but its cut off by another cry of pain
we keep looking out the window
the light has shifted across the city and we hear only a muffled sobbing
the camera turns to look at
carla and danny naked on the bed
he lies back reading the german book
shes curled on her side weeping abjectly
still sobbing she rolls over buries her face in his chest
we see that his neck is scratched up
do it again
she begins to fondle him
he ignores it until he finishes the poem then turns to her
the light has shifted again
danny sleeps alone his face strangely innocent
carla drops onto the bed shakes him
you gotta go
he opens his eyes
shes dressed her hair wet from the shower a faint puffiness around her mouth
he pulls her down to him
no you have to leave
ive got to write a paper
slaps his stomach hard out
he looks up
her face is cold indifferent
he gets to his feet
danny on his way to the door hears something turns
curtis zampf is coming out of a bedroom in his underwear
bring the paper too
curtis now sees danny
a look between them
danny goes out
once a jewish neighborhood now occupied chiefly by blacks latins and more recent immigrants
as danny wearing headphones comes down the steps
two black kids big menacing boombox are coming up blocking his way
danny walks right between them forcing them apart
they turn glare after him
he turns glares back
they scoff and keep going up
he walks on
he lets himself into a row house
we barely notice the mezzuzah on the door post
a nearly vanished world of lower middle class jewish life though the jewishness menorah kiddush cup
is restricted to one dusty corner behind a secular chaos of books newspapers half empty cups half filled glasses
dannys father sits on a faded chair an oxygen mask on a cart beside him
dannys sister linda is cutting his hair with a scissors
when danny enters they both look up at him in surprise alarm possibly even love
for a moment no one knows what to do
the father begins to wheeze puts the mask over his face and breathes deeply
linda tells him to lean back resumes cutting
on the wall we see dannys bar mitzvah photo
meanwhile danny has found a stack of mail all addressed to him
his father and sister are visible behind him in a mirror
without speaking he goes down the hall and we hear him descend stairs to danny has taken off his coat revealing a black t shirt with a red swastika and
is going through a number of cardboard boxes marked d pulling out comic books baseball gloves martial arts gear drawings of voluptuous women morbid gothic figures gun magazines books about hitler nazis
and finally a
automatic stuffed in a blue sock
he removes the clip checks the slide while nodding to the music coming through his earphones
he looks up sees linda at the foot of the stairs pulls off the headset
i knocked you didnt answer
its too late to conceal the gun he places it beside him
she does her best to ignore the swastika shirt
what are you doing here
i just came to get some stuff
ill be out in five minutes
off her he doesnt want me around
she looks down as if that were not true or the way in which it is too complicated to go into
hes going to die
as danny looks away he wont take his medicine
he eats dairy
he probably still smokes when im not around
off dannys helpless gesture i asked him to come live with us
alex offered to share his room unsolicited
but he didnt want to be any trouble
then he couldnt be bitter about living alone
why deprive him of his greatest pleasure
they exchange what are almost smiles
but then the subject shes been trying to avoid the only subject suddenly erupts
ah jesus christ danny how can you wear that thing
you know what it means
to your people
theyre not my people
tell it to hitler
oh he decides
hitlers the chief rabbi now
is this because of those kids who used to beat you up
from sacred heart
nobody ever beat me up
as she sighs turns to go look linda therere fifty reasons
even if you knew them all thered be another fifty you didnt know
do you know them
off him i made him some noodles for dinner
you can heat them up and ive got to get back to the you can heat them up and eat with him
danny now wearing a plain white t shirt bends over the coffee table eating a noodle casserole and reading the post
his father eats off a tv table
he finishes cursorily wipes his mouth picks up a remote and turns on the television
a hoarse rasp do i give a shit
danny holds up both hands hes not arguing simply informing
the torah says not to light a fire on the sabbath because its work correct
danny sighs but if alternating currents running through the wires every second of every day and i throw a switch send it here instead of there how is that lighting
do chickens give milk
he channel surfs until he comes to a stand up comic doing a routine
they both watch
tv the comic is funny in a brutal compulsive way
lots of pop references implicit postmodern nihilism
the routine reflects what danny and the shiites the unabomber timothy mcveigh t
eliot et al
have against the modern world
the father grunts with grim satisfaction he suspected as much
offering consolation howard stern
danny sighs why bother
not like mr
he was funny
as they watch apropos of nothing after your mother died thats when you stopped going to shul
doing your homework
and thats when the mets started to stink
cause they got rid of johnson
he knew how to deal with the assholes
dallas green please
the father snorts
on tv the comic gets off a line and they both laugh
their laughs are quite similar they glance at each other
theres some maple walnut in the freezer
linda says youre not supposed to have dairy
just a little
whats the difference
danny goes into the kitchen
the father extracts a pack of salems from between the cushions lights one takes a desperate drag
the phone rings
he curses stubs it out grabs the phone
its for you
danny gives his father a dish of ice cream takes the phone
my names guy danielsen
im a reporter with the new york times
impressed suspicious new york times
his father looks up
danny takes the phone into the kitchen
im doing a piece on right wing groups post oklahoma city
i hear youre an important figure in those circles
you have a lot of interesting ideas
who told you that
isnt it true
yeah its true but
howd you get this number
no not here
theres a place off queens blvd
near the courthouse
a high angle view of the coffee shop
after a moment danny enters frame starts toward it
danny enters looks around
to his surprise he sees guy danielsen from the nazi meeting rising extending his hand
sardonic now he gets it you
guy shrugs smiles apologetically
as danny declines guy gets out a small cassette recorder is about to turn it on when he notices dannys reaction
is it okay if i record this
yeah fine go ahead
so whats this about
is this about me
im trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next
i thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting
what about curtis zampf
curtis is a politician and a bit of a hustler
hes not a thinker
the other night you said the modern world is a jewish disease
could you elaborate on that
in the movement the racialist movement we believe theres a hierarchy of the races
not just in iq but in the civilization the art the forms of government the civilizations that each race produces
why are you writing this down if youre recording it
it helps me concentrate
so does that mean youre a white supremacist
what should i be a white inferior ist
a multicultural zulu egalitarian
let me ask where are your people from
my mothers family is french my fathers was german originally
so who do you thinks given more to the world the germans beethoven goethe nietzsche or the entire continent of africa
ibos bantus mandingos
danny what about the jews
danny shifts in his seat growing more interested
the jews are different
blacks are disgusting and inferior but its like criticizing a retarded child
the jews are
a poison in the human well
let me give you an example
what do you mean
you ever fuck a jewish girl
did you ever fuck one guy
laughing embarrassed whats that go to do with
ive gone out with a with jewish women
what did you notice
jewish girls like to give head right
i dont know
is that right
and jewish men like to get it
everybody likes to dont they
its very pleasurable
but the jews are obsessed with it
you know why
because the jew is essentially female
real men white christian men we fuck a woman
we make her come with our cocks
but the jew doesnt like to penetrate and thrust he cant assert himself that directly so he resorts to perversions
oral sex is technically a perversion you know that dont you
as guy nods after a woman has been with a jewish man she never wants a normal partner again
a normal man
does that mean the jew is the better lover
youre not listening
he isnt better
he gives pleasure but thats actually a weakness
danny what makes you think you know all this
lets just say ive done due diligence
so fine its not that the jew the jews own the media and the banks
its that theyre sexually corrupt
the jews clearly control the media and the banks
investment banks not the commercial ones
but the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality
they undermine traditional life they deracinate society
danny leans over to make sure guys getting it right
tear out the roots
a people a real people derives its genius from the land the sun the sea the soil
this is how they know themselves
but the jew doesnt have soil
he has israel
those arent jews
of course theyre jews
notice the israelis a fundamentally secular society
they no longer need judaism because they have soil
the real jew is a wanderer a nomad
he has no roots no attachments
so he universalizes everything
he cant hammer a nail plow a field
he can only buy and sell invest capital manipulate markets
he takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books ideas numbers
this is his strength
pumped this is what he loves take the great jewish minds marx freud einstein
what have they given us communism infantile sexuality and the atom bomb
in a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of europe theyve taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a
chaos of class warfare irrational urges and relativity a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt
because it is the deepest impulse of the jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread nothing but nothingness
nothingness without end
are all jews the same
differences exist of course but theyre irrelevant
for the jew his jewishness dominates everything
even the ones who renounce it who hate it who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife
theyre still just jews
guy finishes writing that and looks up
danny this is great
youre incredibly articulate
one more thing
how can you believe this when youre a jew yourself
danny smiles at the mistake
guy says nothing youre kidding right
do you know rabbi stanley nadelman
he used to be at congregation beth elohim in ozone park
how would i know him
he says you were bar mitzvahed there in march
you believe that
and you call yourself a reporter
so youre saying its not true
look at me
do i look jewish
he indicates his hair turns sideways to show his profile
were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else
do you know who youre fucking with here
thats what im trying to find out danny
who am i fucking with here
sputtering unsure what to say listen to me
why would nadelman lie
to discredit me
because i know who they are
look i thought i explained it to you
those people can say or do anything
and they will
its all narrative to them its
are you going to print what this guy said
give me a reason not to
its reckless disregard
ill sue you and your fucking jew paper
does that mean you deny what he says is true
yes or no
gun pulled from dannys pants slammed down on the table
guy sits back abruptly
danny picks it up cocks it
look at me
look at me guy
oh now you cant look at me
look at me you schmuck
look at me
pokes the gun in guys face you print that shit in the new york times
ill kill myself
everyone in the place is staring
danny walks out stuffing the gun in his pants shoving a man aside to get to the door
traveling through low tree covered mountains listening to the overture to tannhauser
carleton driving o
one eye bandaged riding shotgun
in back billings and danny flipping through a times
do we have to listen to this shit
whyd we have to leave so fast
nobody made you go
dannys running from the law
how come your mother gives you a car when youre too fucking blind to drive
cackling she says cause now i cant crack it up
assholes at four oclock
leans out the window giving dual birds to an empty street
the others laugh
the van stopped in front
all of them out of the car
no ones around except the noisy crickets
the city kids are uneasy
i thought there were people here
ill go look
he walks toward the back
billings decides to go with him
i better stay with the van
yeah you better stay here and guard it
gives him the finger
carleton laughs but he stays back too
danny and billings see people in back
now nine young men and a bulldog come to greet them survivalists speed freaks skinheads
and one blank loner drake with a blue swastika tattooed to his lips like a tiny kiss
a case of steroid excess fixes his gaze on danny
were from new york
curtis zampf invited us
are they in the wrong place
then someone laughs they all relax exchange greetings obscure handshakes
everyones just getting comfortable when for no apparent reason
slugs danny in the face
he stumbles backward
the others crowd around keep him from falling also from getting away
billings starts to help but people grab him this is dannys problem
steroid comes at him
danny steps inside the charge and goes to work on the bigger mans body
we barely see what happens but we hear it and feel the crowds shock
danny is stronger than we realized and much more vicious
in seconds steroid sinks to his knees face bloody
danny holds up him leans close enough
steroid mumbles in the affirmative
danny nods then hits him four more shots to the face
even this crowd winces
steroid drops with a wet thud
as danny straightens up wiping the blood off his hands people instinctively step back
which was his room
ferrety glasses number ten
on the end has an extra window
danny walks into the room
steroids stuff starts flying out the door
danny on a pay phone
yeah im trying to reach carla is she
did she get my other message
no ill call back
danny hangs up the phone glances into a room where we dimly glimpse nazis taking drugs drinking beer screaming
then incomprehensible shrieking rage a fight breaking glass
danny sighs bored
he spots two nerdy nazis kyle and whit playing some battle re creation board game and rehashing look if hitler had knocked out the raf in which he could easily
easily have done hed have taken england and the u
wouldnt have had a staging ground for the invasion yeah
but he blew it going after civilian targets
just like he blew the russian front diverting supplies to auschwitz
danny looks up the hill toward a farmhouse perched above them
one light burns inside
her place is down the road
but she just comes out for weekends sometimes
danny squats to look at the board game
what is this stalingrad
but were refighting it with world war i technology
its a fucking bloodbath
he grins maniacally
kyle is emboldened by dannys unexpected friendliness lowers his voice
that was unbelievable what you did to lucas
the guys an animal
you could do it
get out of here
you look right through him
hes there but theres something on the other side of him that you want
its all you want
and whatevers in the way doesnt matter
then its easy
as kyle and whit contemplate his wisdom
either of you know anything about explosives
they both look up very interested
jews man black hat beard woman sheitl shawl boy kippah twerpy girl fat ugly even a dog a star of david on its side
blacks man watermelon pitchfork woman fat fried chicken boy syringe mm girl twins welfare check dog black
take a breath let out a little relax then squeeze
a rifle shot nothings hit again
a bullet hits the jewish boy in the rear end
sunlight streams through the hole
we are danny peers down the barrel of an m
kyle squats beside him
which one were you aiming at
kyle nods patient is drawing dannys attention back to the target when
sets up beside them begins squeezing off rounds so fast it sounds like an automatic weapon
targets the bullets chew up and knock over all four jews
and selectively shooting the mans face the womans breasts the boy and girl in the groin
the dog he merely flattens
drake looks at danny without expression drops the clip shoves in a fresh one and riddles the black family in similar fashion
danny pay phone to his ear flipping through a new york times
he throws it aside as a voice comes on the line
its me danny
we met at that
meeting at your house
yeah i remember
kill any jews yet
i didnt realize you cared
i was just curious how full of shit you were
did you know that there was a new york times reporter there that night
really which one
i bet it was the guy with the prada shoes
i didnt notice his shoes
did your mother know he was there
i doubt it
how did you find out
he called me up
he wanted to talk to me about my ideas
he didnt realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one
you werent complaining about my play last time
thats a much easier game
why dont you come visit well have a rematch
too many good players down here
im with one right now
bigger and better
then how come youre talking to me
he hangs up walks straight into
nazis sprawled about drinking beer impassively watching tv
the bulldog pants on the floor
carleton calls to it gas chamber
it trots over receives a scrap of food
everything desultory to the whole room when are we going to do something
people glance up wearily give us a break
danny billings o
and drake walk through the town looking for trouble
a couple of local teenagers watch them impressed by the swastikas tattoos swagger
two waiters jewish college students athletic confident watch the nazis come in
one indicates to the other that hell handle this
he brings menus water hes carefully polite
you know what you want
we sure do
the waiter ignores the innuendo readies his order pad
ham and cheese on white
forbearance we dont have ham
we dont have cheese
what the hell do you have
thats what the menus are for
roast beef and swiss
i said no cheese
whats wrong with cheese
this is a kosher restaurant
we dont serve meat with dairy
what about chicken
the bible only says dont seethe a kid in its mothers milk
but chickens dont give milk
look you want cheese go someplace else
but its stupid right
you admit its stupid
no i dont admit its stupid
you can have chicken with eggs but not with milk
why is that
im not here to talk about religious law if you dont like but you already talked about it you said its not stupid
why isnt it stupid
calling the other waiter steve
steves going to explain it
steve approaches a sawed off broom handle over his shoulders
we have a problem here
we sure fucking do
we dont understand why you cant eat chicken with milk
it doesnt make sense
an intellectual religion isnt about making sense
its about its about the incomprehensible steve not the idiotic
that explains it
now we understand
the nazis laugh
steve swings the broom handle at danny
who ducks it grabs it slams it back at him
a judge white haired red faced blue eyed well meaning peers down at the four nazis still bruised from the fight
as the altercation appears to have been instigated equally on both sides prison terms strike the court as excessive
the nazis are relieved
however the defendants political views suggest that they might profit from contact with members of our community whose experiences differ from their own
numbers tattooed on an arm
a thumb steadily smooths the skin as rumanian accent uninflected when i refused to have sex with him the warden had my sister esther executed in front of the entire
the nazis accompanied by a hate counselor male sit in plastic chairs opposite five elderly jews
the speaker is in her late s still something of a beauty
everyone considered it my fault
after that of course i did anything he wanted
why didnt he just rape you
snickering among the nazis a whispered crack whod want to fuck her anyway
i hear one more remark like that we go back to the court for resentencing
he was a pig like you so perhaps he had no taste
the nazis laugh
the jews try to calm the woman though she has spoken without any evident emotion
billings gets up restless
sit down please
as billings sits thank you mrs
mr liebowitz you indicated you had a story you wanted to tell
nazis are dozing staring out the window
threads a piece of dental floss through the zipper pull on his trousers
danny is visibly disgusted by the whole business
over this we hear the man was afraid to let us hide on his farm any longer but he agreed to take us to a more remote place
on the way he was stopped at a checkpoint and when the soldiers found us in the hay one of them grabbed my son out of my arms
he began to cry so i reached for him not to take him back simply
the man mid s tall stooped a crushed spirit
simply to assure him i was there
but the sergeant became enraged
he stuck his bayonet in my sons chest and lifted him up impaled on it
my son was three years old
billings is muttering what a load of crap
the hate counselor looks over sharply
the other nazis are stunned by the story
danny can barely contain himself though we are not sure why
he held him up so that the blood spurting out of him feel on my face
the soldiers were laughing
a horse hitched to a hay wagon farmer driving
three nazi soldiers have discovered a jewish family hiding in the hay
a sergeant is holding up something unseen on the end of his rifle
the polish man who has been telling the story looks up at whatever it is
blood falls on him
the nazis are laughing
when the blood stopped the sergeant pushed my son off the bayonet and said there you can have him now
the room is silent
the nazis faces blank shaken
and what did you do
what are you trying to say
what did you do while the sergeant was killing your son
forget it danny its all bullshit
wait a second
to billings shut up
to man mid s what did you do
what could he have done
what could he have done
you fucking kikes
you cant say that
the nazis killing his kid
he couldve jumped the guy
he couldve gouged his eyes out grabbed the bayonet and gutted him
what would you have done if they were killing your son
the counselor is briefly confused
theyd have shot him on the spot
he would have been dead in two seconds
who are you judge
to danny please sit down
okay thats it
youre going back to over him to polish man what do you think you should have done
and you you think you know what you would have done
you have no idea
you cant even imagine what that was like
and you never will
dont listen to them danny
its all a bunch of crap
what is crap
the so called holocaust
it never happened
its the hoax of the twentieth century
disgusted with this idiocy oh please
danny its true
there were no six million
at most two hundred thousand jews died in the camps
and the majority of them were from disease and the jews are shouting about historical records the disappearance of families whole towns
but danny is louder where did you read this
surprised he knew yeah
hes a respected scholar
even no am chomsky says he billings if hitler didnt kill six million why is he your hero
concentration camps all over europe and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand
hes a putz
some surprise that a nazi is arguing against a denier
hitler was not a putz
hitler was real
god created him to punish the jews for abandoning god
the other survivors are embarrassed by this but the ancient jew ignores them
it is you who are putzes
little pishas with your dreams of hatred and killing
danny scoffs gets up to leave
where do you think youre going
we have nothing to learn from these people
they should learn from us
as danny walks out the ancient jew catches his eye
and what should we learn from you daniel
her use of dannys name feels knowing slyly invasive
all sound vanishes for a beat and danny barely manages to say kill your enemy
kyle opens the trunk of his car shows danny inside two bags of shotgun powder and several lengths of metal piping with screw on caps
what is it
green dot shotgun powder
for pipe bombs
off dannys reaction smiles a guy in a lumberyard gave it to me
a donation to the cause
guess whos here
as danny quickly slams the trunk your girlfriend
shes up at the house
in the driveway carlas mercedes a triumph motorcycle
danny peers in through the windows goes to the door
danny sees carla sitting on a green sofa wearing a white sundress and leafing through a magazine
curtis is mixing drinks
lina is practicing with her stylus on a new electronic organizer
my ls keep coming out as cs
spots danny the prisoner returns
danny greets them all
carla barely looks up
danny get a drink and come talk to me
danny talking with lina and curtis but watching carla
insulting people who were in the camps
whats the point
theyre liars and cowards
im sure they are
but what do we accomplish by pointing it out
its the truth
curtis rolls his eyes
lina signals him to lay off
danny what do you think of our troops
trying to be diplomatic they have guts
and they know what they hate
which is good
but they have no idea why they dont think they dont read
theyre on beer and crank half the time
a phone rings in another room
the young people in this country
theyre like pigs all they want is happiness
but one needs pigs sometimes
as it rings again to carla liebchen
carla puts down her magazine goes out to the kitchen
dannys eyes follow her and curtiss follow his
do you feel youre making progress here
you mean ilio manzetti
take on something simple
something you can actually accomplish
to curtis maybe hed be more valuable in the city
an urban type
danny is stung
carla calls from the kitchen
he starts who could be calling him here
as he goes into the kitchen to take the phone curtis says quietly
hes mad lina you know that
she hears him but doesnt respond
danny picks up the phone theres a new york times beside it
carla busies herself about the kitchen
you know what today is
how did you get this number
its moms yartzeit
danny starts to hang up sees carla watching turns away keeping his voice low
how did you get the fucking number
i want you to say kaddish for her
its the only thing she asked from us
i dont do that
you do it on the inside
dont tell me what i i want you to do it on the outside too
he hangs up
he grabs the times looks through it quickly
dropping the times why wont you talk to me
im talking to you right now
he tries to kiss her
she pushes him away
when can i see you
in german carla its time to leave
i have to go visit my father
hes at a home out here
she starts to walk past
he grabs her arm
im coming to your room tonight
she tries to pull free he wont let her go
just after midnight
but dont come through the house theyll hear you
im in the back bedroom second floor
climb onto the kitchen roof ill leave the window open
he tries to kiss her but she ducks away and goes out
danny is parked opposite a fortresslike building of soiled brick
for a long time he cannot bring himself to get out
finally he opens the door
a large woman about her body barely contained by a brilliant magenta dress greets him with a smile the size of a wedding cake
she holds out a prayer book stuffed with flyers
she speaks quietly not wanting to disturb the service yet even so her voice is huge and her flashing eyes clearly expect some kind of enthusiastic response
within we hear the alenu being chanted
danny ignores her and the proffered siddur
a basket of yarmulkes seems to infuriate him but he snatches one anyway and conveying a helpless disgust puts it on his head
from within he hears
in rough unison ba yom ha hoo ba yom ha hoo
he stands with his hand on the door but not opening it
on that day the eternal shall be one
and his name shall be one
the organist plays a brief decrescendo
the mourners kaddish can be found on page
is anything wrong
shut the fuck up
shes startled but not intimidated is about to respond when danny simply turns and walks out of the building
he stops beneath an open window through which he hears
grant us peace thy most precious gift o thou eternal source of peace
we recall with loving memory those whom thou hast summoned unto thee
and we mention by name
danny closes his eyes but at the end adds under her breath harriet kantor balint
a half dozen voices including dannys recite in unison
yis ga dal vyis ka dash shmay ra bo
the body of the congregation joins in on certain phrases producing a subtle and solemn music
danny chants the entire prayer and the moment it ends and the rabbi begins the benediction
may the lord bless you and keep you
he starts toward his car
but the rabbis voice seems to follow him unnaturally loud and clear may he cause the light of his countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you
to himself eat shit
may you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming
shouting to the empty street and let us say
with organ singsong ah ah ah
as danny reaches the van he sees the large woman silhouetted in the open doorway
danny realizes hes still wearing the kippah
he throws it at her but it only goes a couple of feet
he catches it throws harder
this time it floats back toward him and he has to jump out the way to keep it from hitting him
he gets in the car and drives off
we are danny hoists himself onto the kitchen roof
above him is an open window candlelight flickering
he starts into the room stops
carla sits on the bed straddling curtis who lies beneath her
she is looking right at danny
curtis unaware of him keeps thrusting into her from below
danny starts to leave but on second thought stays
carla stares expressionless yet more attentive to him than to curtis
indeed their eyes never leave each other so that when she becomes aroused we understand that it is danny she is responding to danny she is really making love to
gradually her face loses its aloofness and seems to reach out to him to reveal feelings that she can no longer deny
she holds her gaze until at the final instant she shudders out a series of stifled cries
when she looks again the window is empty
a knock at the door
he looks up curtis comes in
danny stiffens at the sight of him but curtis is friendly
what are you reading
danny tilts the book to show him history of political philosophy
nods approvingly ive got to go to boston
i came to say goodbye
what about mrs
they left an hour ago
off dannys disappointment you mind some personal advice
thats not the side your breads buttered on
off dannys silence how soon can you get back to the city
a week or so
theres something i want to do here first
off dannys silence okay
the sound of splitting wood
then voices in a cavernous space
youre stepping on my fucking
get off me
sounds of punches a scuffle stop it
wheres the light
one appears illuminating nothing dissipating into the still vaster darkness
a series of lights bang on in ecclesiastical bursts illuminating a vaulted ceiling
stained glass panels
we are a dour ornate place built in the early decades of the century
the sight of it silences everyone for a moment
drake billings carleton o
and steroid run wild
kicking over benches
spray painting swastikas
hurling prayer books
urinating from the balcony
danny looks around like someone revisiting his childhood home slides his hand along a pew back
leafs through a chumash
gazes up at the eternal lamp behind its red glass
the gilded doors of the ark
a hint of kol nidre music haunts him
to himself barely a whisper shut up
danny turns kyle is right behind him
where is it
as kyle hoists a sports bag okay lets take one of these panels off so we can get under the bema
as they unscrew a panel carleton runs past
a football flashes overhead
we hear glass break
danny watches kyle attach a bomb four sticks of dynamite wired to a digital timer to a x with a bungee cord
he hooks the ends cautiously lets go
the cord springs free
the bomb falls
danny catches it
frozen they look at each other
kyle exhales takes the bomb and with danny holding it carefully restrings the bungee
a mechanical noise overhead wow look at this shit
what are they doing
kyle has no idea and doesnt care
danny scrambles out
straightening up danny is stunned by a vision their silver crowns and breastplates velvet robes
and steroid excess lifting one out
danny reacts with an instinctive horror
what are you doing
put that down
put it back in there
steroid cowed by danny starts to obey but before he can
what do you care
i dont but
vaults onto the stage lets look at the fucking thing
each curse makes danny wince but he just hovers about nervously as billings and steroid try to unwrap the torah while others gather some comically wrapping themselves in tallises
put it there on the
he indicates the bema stepping back as if to deny any involvement yet at the same time trying to monitor everything they do
indicating crowns the yod
just be careful with the
puts a crown on his head if i were king of the forest
not prince not duke not earl
danny cannot endure this desecration but everyone else laughs so he keeps his mouth shut
open it up
impulsively taking over here
he shoves his way in and gripping the handles unrolls the torah
low murmurs at the sight of the broad columns the mysterious calligraphy the crackling parchment
danny himself is struck by the sudden immediacy of the sacred text
you read it from right to left
the letters look like squashed bugs
what kind of paper is that
its not paper its parchment
its made from sheepskin
and all the letters are drawn by hand
danny nods then as if against his will
its called the flame alphabet
its supposed to be the word of god written in fire
the mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters
they thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there with secret alternative meanings
danny sees drake watching him smirks to express his disgust
how come you know all this shit
how come you dont know it
pressing the advantage how can you say you hate the jews when you dont know anything about fuck you
i hate the jews at least as much as you do
no you dont
if you hated them youd study them so youd know why you hate them
you know what tefillin is
you know the kaddish from the kiddush
obviously not eichmann
he went to israel
he studied the torah the talmud the mishnah the whole bit
he hated jews
dannys incredulous though its not clear how many of the others know why eichmann was
he was head of the gestapos jewish sector
he deported people to the camps
reaching toward the parchment can we touch it
yeah but not on the letters
why the fuck not
warning finger just dont
billings bristles at dannys authority carleton says to him
didnt you see raiders of the lost ark
that was an ark man
that was a torah
they fucked around with it and the torah melted their faces
thats a movie you moron
fine go ahead
touch the letters
the others are gathered around delicately touching the sheepskin
let me see
he pushes through looks at the torah
he runs his fingers over the crinkled parchment the smooth black letters
i said not on the suddenly billings grabs the parchment in both hands and tries to tear it
its tougher than it looks
what are you doing
he tries to stop him but accidentally or not drake gets in the way and before danny can do anything else billings crumples it and finally tears a long gash
into the scroll
this produces a strange effect on the others
some kyle steroid drake join in
they knock the aitz off the bema it rolls out exposing ten feet of torah
they stamp on it spit on it
others carleton o
though less troubled than danny are surprised and embarrassed by their own revulsion at these acts
danny watches helplessly like the survivor who did nothing as his son was murdered
finally the torah lies torn and soiled on the stage
a strange silence
lets get out of here
danny kneels by the torah
with a tallis he attempts to clean the parchment
carleton and o
help him roll it onto the aitz
echo christ taken down from cross with torah as christ
they replace the cover the yod the crowns
finally danny lifts it up holds it to him as if it were his dead child
he closes his eyes murmurs to himself
shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod
whatd you say
he starts to walk out carrying the torah
why are you taking that
im stealing it
tragedy was barely averted today at temple ahavat torah when a bomb planted under the bema failed to detonate
authorities say that if it had injuries and loss of life could have been in the dozens
danny kyle and others watching the tv
channel s cindy pomerantz spoke to rabbi malcolm weiss
on tv cindy sleek sexy and the rabbi handsome vain
rabbi how is it that disaster and tragedy were averted here today at ahavat torah
apparently the power cell in the timer gave out precisely thirteen minutes before the device was set to go off
so we can only conclude that once again god has intervened to save the jewish people
giving the finger to the tv oh fuck you
as you know cindy thirteen is a mystical number in the jewish faith
we believe that god has thirteen attributes
danny is beside himself
of which the highest is ein sof which means without end or sometimes nothingness without end
nothingness without end
thats very interesting
the purest form of spirit
hes haunted nothingness without end was what hed told guy danielsen the jews were obsessed with
he seems to hear the cello playing kol nidre again
okay everybody out
he switches off the tv
shoves them out the door slams it
alone he sits at the desk finds himself gazing at the torah standing in a corner of his closet draped in the tallis
he slams the closet door it bounces open
slams it again making sure it latches
he sits down looks at the closed door until in bitter resignation he gets up and opens it again
he unrolls the torah on the bed
scotch tapes the tear closed
attempts to clean the stain with a moistened cloth
danny is in the bathroom in front of the mirror holding his shirt up with his chin as he wraps the tallis around his torso
when he lowers the shirt the fringes hang out like the tsitsis that orthodox men wear
he feels a weird loathing for this but he smooths and arranges the tsitsis to look just like a hasids
he clicks his heels together and gives a nazi salute
alenu lshabach laadon hacol
another nazi salute
a knock at the door
he hides the fringes under the shirt throws a blanket over the torah
guy danielsen new york times
tucks in the tallis fringes what do you want
what happened to your article
i couldnt get my editor to run it but i bet he will now that youve put a bomb in a synagogue
that was you wasnt it danny
danny hangs up
a voice makes him jump
hey danny want to kill a jew
danny turns its drake
these are the first words hes spoken
danny and drake pass a low slung modern synagogue
a sign announces ambassador ilio manzetti friday august
danny reacts startled
park up there well walk back
the building is lit
within we hear an amplified voice presumably manzetti giving a speech
we cant make out the words
danny and drake are hidden among the rhododendrons flanking the parking lot
danny is watching a door in the side of the building and eating a sandwich as drake loads a scoped rifle
lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows
you want to kill a jew
i already did
danny assumes the prone position drake sets the rifle in his hands
whod you kill
but no one this important
we hear applause within as the speech ends
okay its over
hell take a couple questions then come out
sight down the rifle toward the door
through rifle scope danny pans from the side door where two men are smoking to a waiting limousine
how did you know they were jews
i can tell
i was a jew in a previous life
before danny can respond drake gestures toward the synagogue
here they come
danny puts his eye back to the scope
scope pov stirring at the door
the men put out their cigarettes
three figures emerge a man and a woman on either side of an older distinguished looking man manzetti
they walk this way
shoot him in the head
always shoot a jew in the head
im a bad shot
i dont think i can just get him in the cross hairs
with those shells anywhere you hit him itll bounce around rip his insides all up
scope pov the trio walking this way cross hairs on manzetti
just squeeze he trigger
danny fires misses
everybody hits the ground
you missed on purpose
i told you i cant whats that
danny looks over his shoulder
his shirt has ridden up his back revealing the tallis wrapped around his waist
i knew it
drake pulls a
from the duffel
without thinking danny rolls over fires the rifle
drake is blown backward dropping the
danny leaps up
drakes on his hands and knees his trousers quickly darkening with blood
drake are you okay
footsteps coming this way
we hear voices get down
hes got a gun
drake picks himself up stumbles away bent over
danny parks the van in an abandoned lot near the river
quickly wiping down the wheel with his shirt he tosses out his duffel bag and the scoped rifle
he climbs out wipes down the door throws the rifle into the water grabs the duffel and hurries away
kyle its me danny
how you doing
i had to come into the city to see mrs
no i gave drake the van didnt he bring it back
dannys on the phone whipping through several newspapers
and he didnt call
no i dont know
he finds a tiny item gunfire reported at synagogue
he scans it no mention of drake or himself
sure come on down
can you bring my stuff
and if drake shows up let me know right away
he hangs up
from behind some books he extracts the small caliber handgun he found in his fathers house earlier
danny alone waiting nervous
he hears footsteps approach he touches the gun in the back of his trousers
lina and curtis enter
how have things been going
how much do they know
indicates a chair we want to talk to you about something
as they sit danny nervous were about to launch an aboveground intellectually serious fascist movement
danny is relieved and intrigued
lina nods at curtis to go on
we want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream works like the bell curve sociobiology anti zionism anti immigration the com munitarian issue
well hold conferences invite liberals blacks jews
chomsky cockburn stanley crouch shahack
ive been waiting all my life for something like this
we want you to help run it
give speeches lead seminars
handle the fund raising
slapped in the face fund raising
we think youd be good at it
off screen we hear the front door
feet come up the stairs
manzetti the synagogues
that doesnt seem to be happening does it
ive been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil hitler
how am i supposed to get anything done there
he stops short as carla walks into the room for shopping
she glances at them puts down her bags goes into the kitchen
danny the night we met you said the name ilio manzetti
we were impressed
we were excited
but here it is september and mr
manzetti is still walking around breathing the air
we need intellectuals we have enough thugs already
dannys watching carla go down the hall toward the back can barely bring his attention back to the conversation at hand
im not an intellectual
i mean i read but
fund raising isnt what i
look if you want to kill jews on your free time fine
we need you to raise money
will you do that for us
he nods but cannot look at her
do you have a suit
off danny to curtis lets get him one
and a cell phone too
as danny turns to go a joke for her own amusement and if you insist on blowing up a synagogue make it that big one on fifth avenue would you
theyre not that jewish
i dont care what they are
i know those people and i dont like them
the rest are just a bunch of kikes arent they
he manages a smile back and hurries away face burning with shame
danny comes out of the building squats between two parked cars and vomits retching spastically until gasping for breath
carla walks over to him wipes his mouth with a crumpled tissue
when she moves to kiss him he holds back shy about the smell but she kisses him anyway on the mouth
carla naked browsing the books sees something in the closet
its the torah danny took from the synagogue
she unrolls it on the bed her gaze moving over the mysterious glossy script
danny coming out of the bathroom sees what she is doing and stops short
whered you get this
i stole it
from a synagogue
she looks at the broad printed columns
how come theres no punctuation
that was a later invention its not in the scrolls
anyway the jews know where the sentences end
they know the whole thing by heart
do you know it like that
but you can read it the hebrew
what do you care
cause i want to know
what is this word
this one here
danny looks at the word then back at her
hes torn between competing desires but finally
and he said
she moves her finger to the left it goes the other way
she knew that oh yeah
moves finger right va yomer adonai el avram lech lecha mayartzcha oo mimohlad tcha oo mbayt avaycha el ha ertez asher arecha
whats it mean
and god said to avram take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your fathers house into the land a different land and
i will show you
danny remains silent a moment affected by the passage
i want to learn to read it
know your enemy
cause its a basic text of western culture
i want to read it in the original
hebrews very difficult
it would take years
im good at languages
he looks at the smooth expanse of her back the articulations of her spine
he finds her very beautiful
put something on
youre not supposed to be naked in front of it
they think its the word of god and its holy and the flesh isnt
yeah its stupid
indicating her t shirt put it on or i wont teach you
she grudgingly pulls on the shirt as he gets a pencil and paper
see the jews love to separate things the holy from the profane milk from meat wool from linen the sabbath from the week the jew from the gentile
as if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that
you cant curse in front of it either
he shrugs as if indifferent to these rules yet compelled to point them out
who gets contaminated the jews or the gentiles
draws a letter aleph
it looks a little like a swastika
it holds a place takes a vowel
the vowels are little dots that go under the letters
where are they
they dont put them in the torah
ill get you a chumash theyll have them there
as she repeats the names how come youre here instead of with curtis
besides the hebrew lessons
the sex is better
even though his dick is so big
with you theres a tragic dimension
he writes each letter as he says it and she repeats after him
danny and kyle
this will be a different kind of device
that damn thing
you know how it made me look
im sorry danny
it wont happen again
im going to use a brand new power cell
plus well have a back up timer
ive gotta kill some jews kyle
im always talking about it
this time its gotta happen
kyles confident and the prospect of this really happening gives danny pause
he feels a brief chill escapes it with
what about drake did he ever show up
no its weird man
nobody knows where he went
danny nods gestures for kyle to split
kyle looks around walks away
danny waits a moment then heads in the opposite direction
danny walking behind a hasidic family man woman year old boy stroller
at a corner the father takes the boys hand and as they cross the street the boy glances back at danny
two nazi soldiers have just discovered a jewish family hiding in the back of a hay wagon
the polish man is holding the little boy
as a soldier tries to take the boy out of his arms the child panics clings to his father screaming papa
it is the scene the survivor described in the meeting with the nazis
but now the father is dannys hush come on dont cry
everything will be all right
a nazi sergeant comes over irritated
the sergeant is danny
in german whats the matter here
to the sergeant in german excuse me im sorry just a moment
the sergeant rips the child out of his arms
the kid becomes hysterical
the father manages to take the boys hand
in polish please sweetheart you have to go
ill see you soon
in an access of disgust the sergeant sticks his bayonet into the boy or rather into something offscreen
we hear a terrible sound the child grunts
the family gasps in horror
danny sergeant lifts the unseen child into the air
its shadow darkens the fathers face
drops of blood run down his cheeks
danny sergeant stares into the fathers face enraged at the mans passivity
dannys face sweating haunted as if hes just woken from the previous
hes still walking down the street but now as if to flee his thoughts he steps through a door into
a jewish bookstore
he grabs the first book that comes to hand reads for a moment throws it down in disgust
picks it up again is still reading when
he looks up at a young man about his own age wearing a yarmulke but otherwise normal hair clean beard neatly trimmed
danny puts down the book trying to conceal that hes been reading it
he offers a hand
stuart manages to restrain the impulse to embrace him but takes the hand warmly
jeez its been since what kennys wedding
so how are you
whats going on
im in the rabbinic program at jts
what about you
what are you doing
something strange i bet
im in a kind of
impressed excited are you an artist
not that kind of
more a private
meaning he cant talk about it
danny notices a young woman dark curly hair sharp eyes
you remember miriam
yeah hey howre you doing
an irony to her
they certainly remember each other
shes at yale law interning with the district attorney
miriam makes a face were getting married next spring
wow thats uh
he glances at miriam but she has picked up the book hed been reading is leafing through it
it makes him uneasy
its great seeing you
maybe dannyd like to come to the minyan for the holidays
danny gives her a dirty look but stuarts thrilled oh good idea
were davening with this group from the seminary
interesting people very open minded you might like them
and guess who comes
you guys could go at it again like the good old days
as stuart scribbles an address
danny and avi used to argue about everything
torah talmud politics girls
it always ended in a fistfight
i always won
the arguments anyway
hands danny the address its a k
in the little chapel
try to make it
itd be fun
he has no intention of going
once they leave he picks up the book and resumes reading
roger brand a high powered ceo sits behind a big desk speed reading something through half glasses
he finishes removes the glasses
a new york times is on the desk
you write that
as danny nods come work for me
youve got a lot to learn i can teach it to you
i have a job
this is a joke
tossing down the pages ill give your group a thousand bucks
you gave fifty thousand to that college magazine
fiftys an exaggeration
anyway that was a different moment
things were possible that arent now
actually i think this moment has possibilities that yeah i read your piece
its very smart
and very wrong
brands phone beeps he touches a button continues
forget the jewish stuff
it doesnt play anymore
over dannys theres only the market now and it doesnt care who you are
people still need values beliefs
no they dont
not the smart ones
because he likes him look ill give you five grand if you can document your tax exempt status
but when you fall off this horse come see me
i can show you how to make a lot of money
i dont care about money
youre a jew
maybe you dont realize it but you are
smiles uninsulted maybe i am
maybe were all jews now
whats the difference
on danny troubled by this
a half dozen white lumpen sit at desks
danny writes anti semitism in large letters on a blackboard
how many of you think of yourselves as anti semites
all the hands go up
actually the term is a bit imprecise since technically jews are only one of the semitic peoples
in fact arabs are semites as are the eritreans the ethiopians and so on
but for our purposes an anti semite is someone who hates or is against jews
now why do we hate them
he looks around
the room is silent
let me put it another way
do we hate them because they push their way in where they dont belong
or because theyre clannish and keep to themselves
murmurs of yeah
but some are confused by this
slightly bigger crowd a few middle class looking people
because theyre tight with money or because they flash it around
because theyre bolsheviks or because theyre capitalists
because they have the highest iqs or because they have the most active sex lives
the audience confused
do you want to know the real reason we hate them
more people white collar workers of both sexes nurses artists
lapel buttons bumper stickers backpacks fight because we hate them
as people exchange puzzled looks because they exist
because it is an axiom of civilization that just as man longs for woman loves his children and fears death he hates the jews
smiles there is no reason
if there were some smart ass kike would give us an argument try to prove we were wrong
and of course that would only make us hate them more
in fact we have all the reasons we need in three simple letters j e w
say it a million times
it is the only word that never loses its meaning jew jew jew jew jew jew jew jew jew jew jew jew jew
danny and kyle sitting in the tall grass across the marshlands toward the manhattan skyline shimmering in the distance
sings looking at watch my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i
he points sharply and an explosion occurs thirty yards away
they run over pick up the mangled timer
a couple of stragglers hurry through the door as we hear
brosh hashanah yika teyvun uvyom tsom kippur yey chateymun
rosh hashanah services
a woman is davening
and it came to pass after these things that god tested abraham
sitting with stuart and miriam
and said to him abraham
and he said here am i
and god said take your son your only son whom you love
to himself its not his only son
the only one he loves
danny looks at avi athletic smooth shaven who grins sardonically and fakes a punch as
they only kill them when they love them
sliding into a seat next to them what are you doing here i thought you were a nazi
come on avi
you know what this guy told me once islam and judaism both start with abraham murdering his son first sending ishmael into the desert then sacrificing isaac
can you please be quiet
and christianitys the same with minor variations
to the people around them folks dont listen to this guy
hes a well known anti semite
snatching off dannys hat look hes a skinhead
its just a style avi
there are antiracist skins
laughing believe me dannys the racist kind
are you a fascist danny
yes or no
whats a fascist
i rest my case
hes a jewish nazi
he always was
whereas avis a zionist nazi
the zionists arent nazis
theyre racist theyre militaristic they act like bullyboys in the territories
they dont have extermination camps
they had sabra and shattila
do you hate them because theyre wimps or because theyre bullyboys
dannys startled by the question but before he can react
over her to danny that was the lebanese that wasnt the israeli army knew about the camps
sharon encouraged the falangists to go in there and murder all the you dont know that
theres no read the early zionists on european jewry they sound like goebbels
they sound like you
the nazis did everything the fuhrer told them
you do everything the torah tells you
or the rebbe
identical slave mentality
avi lunges at him
they begin pounding each other
miriam and danny walk down west end avenue together
hes oddly relaxed with her
why did you come tonight
to see me
after a beat to hear them read torah
i thought you hated torah
that doesnt mean i dont like hearing it
point out all the lies and fucked up thinking
she smiles and even he smiles a little
they walk together oddly companionable
you know the joke a jews shipwrecked on a desert island
when they rescue him they see hes built two synagogues
they say for vhat do you need two synagogues
he says vun to pray in and vun id never set foot in so long as i live so help me god
he nods hes heard it you pray in the one youd never set foot in
and vice versa
i cant help what i think
this is me
she stops in front of a nice doorman building
tell me about lina moebius
startled how did you
i work in the das office
you go to those meetings half the people there are informants
you mean the times guy
which times guy
with the shoes
there was more than one
in an excess of paranoia he walks away
she calls after him
he doesnt look back shit
a fan ruffles carlas hair as she lies on the futon going back and forth between hebrew english torah and a hebrew grammar
danny is on the floor lifting weights
slowly laboriously payn tash chiton vashiytem
correcting her vasitem
vasitem lechem pessel to monat
and make no graven image of the lord or the form of any figure or of man or woman or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like
because hes not like anything
not only cant you see him or hear him you cant even think about him
i mean whats the difference between that and him not existing
still exercising no difference
christianitys silly but at least theres something to believe in
or not believe
judaism theres nothing
to himself nothing but nothingness
judaisms not about belief
whats it about
about doing things
you light candles say prayers keep the sabbath visit the sick
and belief follows
you dont do it because its smart or stupid or it saves your soul
youre not saved
you do it because the torah tells you do
you submit to the torah
dont curse in front of it
flips the book closed why should i submit
you think i should just because theres no reason
he looks at her without answering
no i think you shouldnt
judaism doesnt even need god
you have the torah the law
thats your fucking god
anticipating his objections the books closed
in an access of something she bites his arm hard
he winces pushes her away
she kisses the place she bit
he starts to play with her hair
youre learning the hebrew really fast
i told you im good at this
plus you have nothing else to do all day
oh am i learning it faster than you did
maybe im smarter
he laughs likes her arrogance
but she misunderstands is that funny
you think jews are the only smart ones
as they make out grow aroused
you think im jewish
its all you talk about
jewish jewish jewish
nobody talks about it that much except the jews
dannys taken aback by the simple logic
nazis talk about it all the time
and of course she has grown up among nazis
the real nazis
hitler goebbels they talked about jews incessantly
you ever read their diaries
is that why you became a nazi
so you could talk about jews incessantly
believe me adolf hitler couldnt possibly have hated the jews as much as i do
not in a billion years
you know why
cause he wasnt a rabbi
you want a punch in the mouth
he doesnt hit her why dont we light candles on friday
lets light candles
and say the kaddish
kaddish is the prayer for the dead
i mean kiddush
lets say kiddush
and shave my head fuck through a sheet all that stuff
as he walks away come on just for fun
to see what its like
packed with a well dressed crowd very different from the crowds weve seen here before
down in front mrs
moebius and danny talk in low tones
half the right wing money in new york is here tonight
they came to see you
if you impress them if you do what i know you can this movement will be up and running by tomorrow
and on the front page of the new york times in six months
she straightens his tie directs him toward the lectern
we tested the new bomb
we redesigned the timing mechanism
it cant possibly malfunction
just give your speech
and nothing about jews okay
she walks away
danny steps to the lectern
the crowd quiets
he stands silent for a long moment then closes his eyes and chants with feeling shema yisroel adonai elohenu adonai echod
moebius and curtis exchange wary glances
who knows what that is
a jewish prayer
can anybody imagine why i would say a jewish prayer
because youre a jew
danny laughs with them
that could be one reason
no response let me put it this way
who here would like to destroy the jews
murmurs of approval who wants to grind their bones into the dust
a scattering of applause growing more sustained
and who wants to see them rise again wealthier more successful powerful cultured and intelligent than ever
no one wants that
then you know what you have to do
you have to love them
puzzled mutterings what
whats he talking about
did he say love them
love the jews
it sounds strange i know but with these people nothing is simple
the jew says that all he wants is to be left alone to study his torah do a little business and fornicate with his over sexed wife
but it isnt true
he wants to be hated
he longs for our scorn
he clings to it as if it were the very core and mystery of his being
if hitler had not existed the jews would have invented him
for without such hatred the so called chosen people would vanish from the earth
people react with confusion uncertainty suspicion
and this reveals a terrible truth the crux of our problem as nazis the worse the jews are treated the stronger they become
egyptian slavery made them a nation the pogroms hardened them auschwitz gave birth to the state of israel
suffering it seems is the very crucible of their genius
if the jews are as one of their own has said a people who will not take yes for an answer then let us say yes to them
if they thrive on opposition let us cease to oppose them
the way to annihilate them utterly and completely is to open our arms take them into our homes and embrace them
only then will they vanish into assimilation dilution
a warning finger but we cannot pretend
the jew is nothing if not clever
he will see through condescension and hypocrisy
to destroy him we will have to love him sincerely
on the audience befuddled
a hand goes up
danny nods to it
the man steps forward and we see that its guy danielsen of the times
danny is shaken
but if the jews are strengthened by hate wouldnt this destruction you speak of by love or by any other means in fact make them more powerful than they are
after a beat yes
they would become as god
murmurs of confusion outrage
danny notices the tallis crawling out from under his shirt stuffs it back in
it is the jews destiny to the annihilated so that they can be deified
the murmurs swell jesus understood this perfectly
and look what was accomplished there with the death of just one enlightened jew
imagine what would happen if we killed them all
over the rising outrage so let us say together
one or two voices respond but must people shout him down
moebius is outraged
people are throwing things shouting
the meeting degenerates into chaos
danny talks to mrs
offscreen we hear a tv
are you out of your mind
i was just trying to make a point
if oh my god
im relieving you of all duties
i dont want you working for us anymore
do you know how many people ive brought into
lina come here
carla watching a small tv on the kitchen counter
danny arrives followed by lina and curtis as we hear
according to police he had just left the restaurant and was walking the block and a half back to his office when the gunman stepped out of this doorway fired
seven times at point blank range
then fled on foot
a terrible premonition who was it
moebius impatiently signals him to silence
paramedics arrived within ninety seconds but mr
manzetti was declared dead at the scene
at the mention of manzettis name danny goes white
ilio manzetti was one of the respected and influential men in new york
as an investment banker diplomat adviser to presidents and mayors he helped shape public policy and private finance for more than three decades
hell be missed phil
this is michael port with new york
dannys knees are weak his hands cold his stomach rises
he becomes aware of the others staring at him in amazement
stunned do you think i
danny please we dont want to know
she and curtis walk out of the room
stunned shaken danny leaves in a different direction
the tv plays to an empty room
the assailant is described as a white male in his late s
danny wanders out the door in a daze
his cell phone ringing
he has to search his pockets then fumbles to turn it on
you finally killed a jew man
hows it feel
i cant talk right now
he hears a camera shutter and motor drive
theyre coming toward him
did you kill ilio manzetti
suddenly danny runs after the photographer they struggle
not the camera dont hurt the camera
danny opens the camera rips out the film exposing it
did you kill him
danny glares at him without answering walks away
guy hurries after him
two days ago you addressed a nazi rally
last week you went to a torah study group
what were you following me
how do you reconcile the two
look stay out of what you dont understand
explain it so i can
you work for the new york times
your whole job in life is not to understand things like me
i dont think you know what you are
walking on fast yeah and what are you
a times man
who killed manzetti
if i tell you will you pull the story
not write about me
its too late
if i didnt somebody else would
as danny just snorts yom kippur starts at sundown
will you go to synagogue
turns on him threatening get the fuck away from me
guy backs off
danny crosses the street
hey danny just one more
he glances back
its the photographer who has reloaded and now snaps a shot as danny turns away and keeps going
danny and miriam walking together among the trees
youre telling me you killed him
what kind of gun did you use
guessing a forty five
it was a nine millimeter
so are you
but theyll believe you
as they walk lina moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea
that you proposed it in a meeting at her house
when he doesnt deny it ah jesus danny
what were you thinking
are you glad manzettis dead
do you really want to kill jews
you want to kill me
i was just talking
i look i cant help what i think
he doesnt know how to answer walks away from her to the railing overlooking the water
he stares into the current flowing past
finally miriam joins him
all right what if all along you were actually infiltrating the nazis to expose them
but i wasnt
and only talked about killing manzetti to convince them you were an anti semite
if youd had any idea somebody would take it seriously you never would have said it
i cant say that
think about your father
the truth doesnt mean anything to you does it
danny im trying to save you
over her fucking kike
miriam is stung
she cant believe he said that
still she gets a small tape recorder out of her purse hands it to him
try to get lina moebius on tape telling you to do something
thats right i dont care about truth
i care about you
looks at her watch kol nidres at six thirty
ive got to meet stuart
well be at the minyan tonight and tomorrow
if you need me come there
danny watches her walk away then turns to the railing
ideally a ferry is pulling away from its slip and heading out across the harbor
he watches it then looks down at the current moving past
he reaches a decision throws the tape recorder into the water turns and walks away
danny stops just inside the door
the place is spotless
the desk has been pulled out from the wall covered with a snowy cloth and set for a sabbath meal brass candelabrum challah under a satin cover
and two place settings
carla is pouring wine into the kiddush cup
shes wearing a modest dress her hair is pinned up with a piece of lace
whats going on
she turns startled she hadnt heard him come in
its erev yom kippur
well have dinner then go to shul
atone for our sins
he grabs a couple of olives off the table eats them as he goes through his closet stuffing a couple things in a bag
come on we can be like eichmann
he studied torah
he hated jews
in the closet looking is it like eichmann
are we goofing
i dont know
i just want to try it
looking in other places did you talk to your mother today
what are you looking for
indicates table as he keeps looking why are you doing this
back to the closet i thought god didnt exist
he commands it whether he exists or not
off his silence with difficulty look we can fight him and be crushed
or we can submit
from the closet and be crushed
but what if
being crushed being nothing not mattering what if thats the best feeling we can have
he finds it a kittel stuffs it in the bag
look just light the candles with me
then well eat
you have to eat
you eat first then you light
exasperated he has to explain once you light its yom kippur which means youre fasting so you cant
he trails off looks at her
shes everything he ever wanted and hes already lost her
a woman of valor who can find her
her price is above rubies
he walks out leaving the door open
carla starts to call after him but then doesnt
she turns back lights the candles and awkwardly reads the prayers
danny on a phone
behind him jews hurry home for the holiday
he hears a beep
miriam its me danny
come on the holiday hasnt started pick up the as someone does is stuart davening neilah tomorrow at the minyan
cause he always does
tell him im doing it instead
she argues we hear her voice not her words
danny cuts her off
miriam im davening
he gives me any trouble ill beat the shit out of him right there in the room
shes still talking when he hangs up and walks away
lina and curtis with billings and drake who looks bad
why didnt you tell us
never considered it i was hurt
he went to his friends place and i laid up there til he was better
then he called me
you shouldve gone to the police
i dont think drake wants to talk to the police
ill take care of him myself
the phone rings
curtis answers listens covers the mouthpiece
she takes it with a dramatic gesture
takes the phone hello
what is happening
like you wanted
what are you talking about
who is this
lina you said if i was going to plant a bomb i should a click as she hangs up
he steps away from the phone
hes carrying a grease stained bag and is across from
temple emanu el
kol nidre being sung by a soprano within and organ accompanying her
in the synagogue across the street we hear kol nidre being sung by a soprano an organ accompanying her
danny looks up at the temple
looking up as the nazi sergeant holds the boy on the bayonet over the fathers head
but now danny is the father and the father is the sergeant
he lunges at the nazi knocking him down tearing at this throat
the sergeant screams
in german to his fellows kill him
danny bites through the nazis jugular as bullets rip into him
kyles car is parked on the central park side of fifth
danny gets in the passenger side
kyle is behind the wheel wiring an explosive device
danny hands him the grease stained bag
howre we doing
kyle holds up a solitary pipe bomb
thats all weve got left
itll be enough if we use it right
checks his watch okay the servicell go about another hour
say an hour for the janitors then one more just to be safe
well go in at midnight
kyle has extracted a cheeseburger and shake from the bag
as he starts in on them he realizes danny isnt eating
didnt you get anything
im not hungry
come on lets drive around
we dont want to be spotted here
eating kyle starts the car pulls away
white with fury he is trying to set us up
curtis picks up a cell phone and dials
to drake and billings i want him dead by tomorrow night
that lies within your capacities correct
drake unconsciously licks the center of his lower lip
as they leave we see that he limps horribly
when theyre gone
into phone yes i believe that a bomb is going to be planted tonight at temple emanu el on th street
by the same man who killed ilio manzetti
his name is daniel balint
pov inside van
fifth is quiet
temple emanu el again straight ahead
but now we see security guards near the door
oh what is this shit
dont slow down
pov speeds up whips past the synagogue
not too fast
you said they didnt have night guards
i checked twenty times
somebody must have talked
who even knew
why would she
the manzetti thing must have scared her
she thinks shell get implicated
so what do we do with the device
the plaza straight ahead
take a right on th
as the car turns well put it someplace else
i have an idea
a pencil beam flashlight moves through the darkness
we follow it
the light enters a space where sound echoes
a pencil beam shows kyle on his back attaching the bomb to some kind of wooden floor cupboard
hes worried about the paltry amount of explosives
its all reinforced in here
its not going to blow out the way we want it
danny is too preoccupied flipping through a machzor to answer
if i went back to the lumberyard the guyd give me all the dynamite i wanted
untraceable you wouldnt need to
no it has to be tomorrow
you wont get this many of them in here for another year
itll be fine
its not going to be fine
its just do it
kyle sighs goes about doing it he hears something and freezes
danny clicks off the light
a silhouette on the windows
its just somebody on the street
relieved kyle turns his attention back to the bomb
when do you want it to go off
seven thirty tomorrow evening
so thats what
nineteen thirty minutes
what time is it now
kyle checks his wristwatch sets the timer to eighteen hours eighteen minutes
it begins counting down
kyle and danny come around the corner get in kyles car parked near the side door
a stack of papers the early edition of the times
as danny grabs one he notices a stack of tabloids
front page the manzetti crime scene with screaming headline manzetti slayer jewish nazi
next to this another tab danny grabs a times flips it over
we see only his face registering this unsurprised
he opens the paper
the sweet faced bar mitzvah boy we saw at his fathers house
and a blurry photo of danny walking away from guy danielsen and the photographer outside mrs
dannys face is not clearly seen
he tucks the paper under his arm beside the machzor and crosses eighth avenue toward a cheap hotel
carrying the papers danny goes through the door
danny at the window staring out
the tv plays behind him
on tv a reporter interviewing mrs
moebius youre saying that when he first appeared at your house you had no idea he was jewish
but i have to admit im not terribly surprised
what do you mean
i think anti semitism today is largely a jewish phenomenon
wouldnt you agree
danny cant help smiling at her audacity
in the third reich werent a number of high ranking nazis of jewish origin
yes and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the final solution
really who but a jew would want to kill ilio manzetti simply because he was jewish
who thinks about such things
the papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague curtis zampf has been a federal informant for the past two years
do you believe that
enigmatic smile curtis is always more complicated than he seems
to the camera and so on this the most solemn day of the jewish year a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that
the set is clicked off with the remote
in the darkened screen we see danny take his bag off the bed and go out the door
as danny approaches a stocky young man on a folding chair outside the front door checks him out
the stocky young man beckons him on
as he passes danny spots a gun and shoulder holster inside the mans zippered jacket
several yom kippur services are going on in different rooms
and we hear different groups of voices
and one reading
they cast lots and the lot fell on jonah
danny puts on his kittel a white prayer coat
about forty worshippers most in their s and s
danny slips into the back spots carla up front with miriam and stuart
hes shocked appalled
carla trying to follow along the prayer book suddenly danny is leaning over her shoulder from the row behind
desperate whisper what are you doing here
people sitting nearby hush him he ignores them
miriam called looking for you
she said you might come so i
you gotta get out of here
you dont own this place
listen danny you cant just barge in and shut up
you shut up
who do you think you are
to carla low urgent theres a bomb here
its going to go off at seven thirty
the shushing becomes louder
she turns away
its yom kippur
people are davening
can you take it outside
you have some nerve
danny looks around at the scolding angry pious faces
he hates them
he sits back and closes his eyes
the jewish father played by dannys father is ripping open the sergeants jugular as the soldiers shoot him
one of the soldiers who is now danny says kill them
kill them all
the soldiers begin firing
but now three israeli commandos appear danny avi and the security guard we saw outside
they fire uzis at the nazis who fire back
danny the nazi soldier and danny the israeli commando fire at each other at point blank range
the sound fades and we hear scraping chairs murmurs voices
danny wakes with a start
people are about to resume after a break but theres some confusion
people are talking to stuart who keeps glancing toward danny
danny finds his machzor and gets up
as he approaches the bema stuart comes to meet him
danny listen people expect me to daven they dont want someone they dont know leading their prayers
get out of my way
stuart backs down
danny steps onto the bema opens the machzor
whats going on
who is this
i thought stuart was davening
to the room page
he glances at a clock at the back of the room
yis gadal vyis kadash shmey raba
people join in but one man in back is outraged
jesus christ you know who that is
you see the paper
gently teasing youre reading the paper on yom kippur barry
i saw the paper
thats not him that guy was darker
this is somebody else
that guy wouldnt go to shul barry
you want to bet
ill bet you anything
hes shushed could you please
lets go were leaving
oh for gods sake you leave
im going to get a cop
he stalks to the door but doesnt leave turns back as if compelled to watch this outrage
da amiran balma vimru amen
he begins the silent amidah taking three steps backward then three forward bowing as he prays so that he sees the watch on the lectern
kyle on hands and knees gasping for breath his face bloody
drake sits in a chair injecting methamphetamine into the vein of his forearm
billings comes through the door with a newspaper
i got one
he squats beside kyle shows him the times story about danny
are you kidding me
now do you know where he is
kyle thinks glances at a watch
yeah i bet i do
the windows have darkened
the congregation is on its feet chanting the avinu malkenu the climactic prayer of the day
danny leading the prayers looks up at carla stuart miriam
near the front chanting with him
he looks at the clock
suddenly it seems impossible to go through with this
he stops praying but no one notices
as kyle drake and billings approach the place seems to glow with an inner radiance
drake and billings hold weapons at their sides
the stocky security guard sees them coming and gets up reaching for his gun
billings and drake stop
kyle wishes he werent here
everything suspends for a moment as within the building three distinct groups of voices can be heard each chanting the avinu malkenu at a slightly different point in the prayer
drake raises his gun and fires
people are chanting avinu malkenu so fervently that the gunfire outside seems only a faint popping
no one particularly notices
danny freaking doesnt hear the gunshots
he tries to address the people in the front rows
wait a minute
but the praying is too loud too strong
no one stops or listens
he steps down off the bema
youve got to get out of here
all of you
a few people in front are puzzled by his strange behavior but the rest keep chanting
stuart comes up to danny
you wanted to daven
danny glances over peoples heads at the clock
he doesnt notice
drake stands there
bleeding profusely from the head the swastika on his lips
at first only a few people notice they stop praying
panic confusion whos that
what is he
oh my god
avi is the first one out of his chair walks right at drake
calm forceful put down the weapon
put it down
drake shoots him
avi goes down writhing in pain
people come at drake but he grabs an year old girl puts the gun to her head
everyone turns including drake whos blinded by the blood in his eyes but recognizes the voice
see he knows him
the nazi bastard
drake moves unsteadily toward the front pulling the girl with him
a woman a doctor goes to tend avi who is still conscious
people begin to slip out the back taking children
others stay looking to jump drake but he keeps the
on the little girl
to carla miriam stuart get everybody out of here
he steps back onto the bema separating himself from the others and drawing drakes attention
the clock reads
outside we begin to hear sirens
drake refocuses pulls the girl on
from the hall we hear other groups in the building chanting
avinu malkenu choney nu vaneyenu
avinu malkenu choney nu vaneyenu ki eyn banu ma asim
our father out king graciously answer us though we are undeserving
nu va aneynu
at the front drake wobbles
people start forward
he cocks the gun against the little girls head
shes weeping silently
drake im right here
danny reaches out a hand
drake points the
at him and fires missing
a hand grabs the little girl pulls her to safety
the room is nearly empty now save miriam carla stuart a few others
the avinu malkenu can still be heard from the hall
from the door let them kill each other
barry for gods sake
drake wobbles from loss of blood
nearly drops the
danny glances at the clock
what is it another dud
drake fires again hits danny in the shoulder
she runs forward
the shoulder hurts he calls to the others
miriam others grab carla pull carla toward the door
drake comes toward danny trying to lift the
for the kill
chanainu vanainu ki ain baw nu maah seem
danny grabs drakes gun hand forces it up in the air
the gun goes off
plaster rains down on them
danny catches him under the arms
he looks at the watch
fervent asey imanu tzdakah vachesed
asey imanu tzdakah vachesd vho shi the instant before the prayer ends
its cut off by a sudden silence
then a flash of light
the screen goes white
where we saw danny leave the school as a year old
now looking down we see danny as an adult coming up them two at a time
following danny as he races up
his old teacher rav zingesser appears on a landing above
danny good to see you
i wanted to take up that discussion we were having
as danny hurries past about abraham and isaac
i cant right now
but as he nears the next landing there is zingesser waiting for him again
you remember what you said that isaac actually died on mt
ive been thinking maybe youre right
died yet was reborn in olam ha bah
danny goes past once more
but now looking down at zingesser as he appears above danny yet again
as danny nears the landing
as danny goes by calling after him where are you going
dont you know theres nobody up there
as danny passes the camera we pan to watch him still racing upward
beyond us into the darkness
