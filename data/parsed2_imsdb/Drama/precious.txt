written by geoffrey fletcher january th
a line at a time the following quote appears over a black screen
every blade of grass has its angel that bends over it and whispers grow grow
the talmud a cold wind blows a bright red scarf tangled high on a street lamp
an iron waste bin is blown sideways into an intersection
a stray dog investigates it briefly urinates and then moves on
a book bag drops onto the pavement
visible from the waist down a large young woman in a disintegrating leather jacket turns the waste bin upright and then maneuvers it onto the sidewalk
once finished her thick hands wipe each other until they stop abruptly
here for the first time we see her plump youthful vacant african american face
it is year old precious jones
something inside the bin has caught her attention
precious gazes down upon a soiled and tattered paperback book as the breath from her nostrils steams
the title of the book staring back up at her is unintelligible
she pushes debris aside to get to it
the book plunges deeper into the trash as if trying to flee
the sound of an oncoming car approaches
precious pins the book against the bottom of the bin as the sounds of the oncoming car close in
precious finally comes up with the book
its title is still unintelligible
when she flips it over however the letters on the cover which are facing us now make sense
the car sounds incredibly close
precious looks sharply to her left
an eerie skid precedes an eerier thud
precious almost hit falls back on to the pavement as her book skips across the intersection and down into a drain
she lays on the sidewalk pressed against the base of the street lamp with her eyes closed
the car reverses skids stops for a sec shifts and screeches off
the garbage bin overturned yet again rocks side to side until settling to a stop
an ambulance eases up to the intersection
when the stoplight changes the ambulance motors past precious in no hurry
a moment later its sirens blare and it speeds off into the distance
the stray dog returns re investigates the garbage bin and turns to precious
he licks her face
tom cruise walks up to her
precious still vacant eyes finally open to see tom and the red scarf falling from the street lamp towards her
tom gives her a hand up
flirtatious whats your name girl
whats your name
precious still blushing looks on the ground
my name is precious jones
i wanna take tap dance lessons
mama said we cant afford it
the end of a final wave of students head to class
plus she say who wanna see me dancing anyway
i goes to i
today i was almost late
thatd a been a problem
precious scurries behind them donning the red scarf and lugging her book bag
precious sits in the last row behind children half her size years younger and mostly african american
noise and projectiles fill the air
wicher a frail man in a bow tie and tweed coat stands at the head of the class trying to establish order
class would you please turn to page
precious book stays closed as the other students find the page
two boys in front of precious giggle boisterously at some private joke
wicher looks annoyed but accustomed to this
i like maff but i dont say nuffin dont open my book even
just sit there
the giggling boys continue their shenanigans
the boys finally open their books
everyday i tell myself something gonna happen like im gonna break through or somebody gonna break through to me im gonna learn catch up be normal sit in the front
the giggling flares up again
precious sneers at the boys
today we are going to review mondays assignment
would anyone like to begin
the boys get louder
wicher looks at them helplessly
i like mr
i pretend he my husband and we live in weschesser whereever that is
i can see by his eyes mr
wicher like me too
i wish i could tell him all the pages in my book look the same to me but i cant
the entire class cries oooooh
wicher looks scared
nobody spect us to learn nuffin no way

bitcher i mean mr
the boys fallout slapping hands
the class turns to mr
wicher in unison to see what he will do
i want to see you boys after class
wicher but you aint my type
grow some tits
just be quiet
wicher tries to carry on throughout the boys unrelenting defiance
other students are continually distracted by the boys
precious looks bothered the most as mr
wichers soft voice loses the battle
i feels sorry for mr
he do his best but he aint got no voice
he scared too
i feels sorry for him
the boys break out in riotous laughter until
a desk slams against the floor
the boys whirl around to see two large hands take hold of them and snatch them out of their chairs
precious has had enough
shut up motherfuckers im trying to learn something
hard enuff wiffout you stupid clowns carryin on
trembling sorry precious
trembling we cool
precious shoves them down in their seats and huffs
go on bout cha lesson mr
they ain gonna give you no more trouble today
precious turns her desk upright and sits back down
wicher looks grateful
im like the polices for mr
thas why i cant be late to maff
knock knock knock
someone is outside the classroom
wicher waves her inside
dark skirt suit enters squints to find precious points briefly and then whispers something to mr
precious rolls her eyes
lichenstein sends precious an oversized grin and beckons to her
what this bitch want
only motherfuckers i hate call me claireece
precious gathers her belongings
the other children watch every move in silence
when she reaches the front of the class
you gonna be okay mr
forcing a smile of course precious
an unconvinced precious grins sadly as mrs
lichenstein motions for precious to step out ahead of her
wicher looks abandoned
the door closing behind precious might as well be to a prison cell block
noise inside the classroom returns immediately
precious heads off down the wide hallway in silence
precious waits among plants plaques pictures and file cabinets while mrs
lichenstein sits across from her reading from a file
lichenstein closes the file and sets it on the desk between them
are you pregnant
youre sixteen still in junior high school and pregnant with your second child
claireece are you pregnant again
precious stares at the file without responding
do you have any thoughts about your situation
precious shrugs her shoulders
precious doesnt respond

precious doesnt respond

if thats the way you wanna play it we can do this all day
the hand on precious lap makes a fist
thas when i knew id never get back to maff class
lawd i hate this hoe
precious lunges from her chair and reaches over the desk
lichenstein vaults backwards in terror and tumbles to the floor
precious bursts out of mrs
lichensteins office and walks to the exit
lichensteins distant voice still cries for security
precious heads down the hall without looking back
lichensteins cries are still audible
a faucet runs
precious stands over the sink washing dishes
a moment later a womans voice speaks over the sound of a television
you get my cigarettes
her heart beats loudly
delicately no mama i dropped some of my thangs on the way to school
a screeching car echoes distantly
dress sits on the couch with her back turned to precious
this woman looks as if she is one with the furniture
a cigarette smolders between her fingers as she watches the price is right on television
precious still waiting for the other shoe to drop looks momentarily relieved and returns to the dishes until
a thick glass ashtray smashes into precious head
precious falls and lands
onto a bed completely naked
twice her age falls on top of her and gyrates
an enormous hand muzzles her
precious lays there impassively as her vacant eyes fixate on a long crack in the ceiling
as we drift towards the crack it seems to widen to open into another world where
blinding flashbulbs pop everywhere
precious walks the red carpet with tom cruise
they head toward the entrance of the theatre stopping occasionally to sign autographs
both sport matching sunglasses
the paparazzi is going wild
precious removes her sunglasses and searches the sky
a lightening crack roars
rain starts to fall as
drops of water seep from the crack in the ceiling accompanied by the sound of distant thunder and masculine grunts morphing into
at the top of her lungs piggy cunt bitch
git your jezebel ass up and git to dinner fore i give you something to cry about
eyes closed with ashes and tears on her face precious lays still on the floor
her hands are still wet from the dishes
gallons of water splash down on her
her eyes spring open
mary stands over precious with a large dripping pot in her hands
she drops it on the floor and returns to the couch to watch another program
i ain gon say it again
pots and pans sizzle on the stove
precious now wearing a dry t shirt tends to dinner meticulously until
the sharp sound of a buzzer rings
mary and precious turn to the door in unison
tell them assholes to stop ringing my bell
here is our first good look at mary
she wares way too much make up
precious wipes her hands and heads for the door though mary sits much closer to it
no one ever ring the bell but crack addicts
i hates crack addicts
give the ghetto a bad name
precious presses talk on the intercom
stop ringing the goddam buzzer motherfucker
precious heads back to the dishes until
the buzzer again
precious returns to the intercom
stop ringing the goddam buzzer
press listen stupid
precious sighs and presses listen
its sondra lichenstein for claireece and ms
precious face goes blank
mary looks alarmed and mutes the television
who that precious
white bitch from school
lichenstein stands by the buzzer bundled up
thumping rap music from a car passes behind her
she bounces lightly to the beat
lord where is crack addicts when you need em
precious and mary still try to sort this out
what she want
i dont know
ask her stupid
precious presses talk
what you want
precious presses listen
i want to talk to you about your education
eighty six that bitch
precious looks unsure
a young man exits the building smoking a cigarette
lichenstein puts her hands together dramatically pleads for a smoke and gets one
she puts it in her mouth and lights hers to his
bouncing to stay warm she nods in gratitude as the man walks off
this bitch crazy
sides my muver dont want to get cut off welfare and thats what mrs
lichenstein comin to visit result in
its hard to believe a hoe dis retarded sposed to educate somebody
precious presses talk

lichenstein bounds off into the night with her cigarette
i dont know what an alternative school is but i feel i want to know
precious leans against the refrigerator glowing
my heart is all warm
wicher say im a good student
there is silent movement behind precious
mary approaches quietly wielding a skillet
mary swings for a head shot but precious easily sidesteps the blow
the refrigerator takes the hit and a new dent
precious stares calmly at her mother
mary almost looks ashamed
still aglow precious grins absently at her mother and then leaves the kitchen
mary watches her go and then struts back to the television speaking to herself
school cant help none

who she think she is
beat think she cute now right
shoulda kept her mouf shut
uppity now cause he give her more childrens than he did me
shouldve kept her damn mouf shut
stupid little pig
who she think she is
what im sposed to do for cigrettes now
precious now dressed for bed and still beaming pulls the covers to her chest
the sun rises into the sky
the shadow of a tree draws shorter as does that of an open gate
the clock on the night stand reads
we drift back to find precious sitting on the side of her bed fully dressed with neon yellow leggings and her red scarf as she stares at the clock
various sheets of colored construction paper display precious handprints on the wall
their sizes increase progressively and end beside a poster of cyndi lauper
when the clock reads precious stands looks in a mirror sees a pretty blond white girl and leaves the room
precious heads for the front door
where you going
dunk clink clonk clank precious opens locks with swift precision
you hear me talking to you
precious leaves slamming the door behind her
we track with precious as she exits her building
ruby a who could easily pass for a younger precious trails precious
a naked blond armless barbie doll dangles by its hair from rubys hand
precious when we gon play

precious stops abruptly and turns around

precious heads away into the distance
i check in wif you tomorrow precious

precious walks gazing upward
street lamps pass beneath the sky as autumn leaves fall from nowhere
im lookin up
lookin out for a piano to fall a desk couch tv mama maybe
always somethin in the way
im gon see all about it
watch where you goin orca
precious looks down to find three skinny boys each much smaller than she taunting her
then my mind come back down to earf
shut up fool she gon eat you
the boys burst out in laughter slapping hands and grabbing their crotches
boyz always been little things that laff and grab they selves cept for when is real big and pregnant wif my first baby
then boyz dont say nuffin
they stand out the way real quiet like im queen of england
pointing at her leggings the boys erupt some more
still i wonder

precious crashes to the ground
the boys look surprised a moment and then howl harder than ever
i always be fallin like that when my mind be wanderin
mama say i gonna fall to my death one day
wonder what that be like
the boys continue to taunt her from above
precious stares into space as if they arent there
precious in black leotards fishnet stockings and patent leather shoes tap dancing away
she finishes her number as tom cruise walks into frame clapping
tom gives her a hug and a friendly lick on the ear
precious continues to stare into space as a dog licks on her ear
precious walks amongst a crowd of people and stops to stare at the hotel theresa a beautiful pre war building
precious enters the lobby
an older black man in a blue uniform sits in a chair reading the daily news through thick glasses
he doesnt move react speak to or look at precious as she passes him
precious glances back at him as she reaches the elevators presses the button and waits
the elevator doors open
precious steps inside and turns around
her eyes widen and time slows down
the sound of wind rises
moments later precious snaps out of her daze and hastily pushes button
the doors close
the elevator doors fly open
precious steps out to find an african american woman in her she sits behind a desk while speaking on the phone
why do you say that shit when you dont mean it trey
im not playing with you and i know that wasnt your damn sister neither
because you dont have one
cornrows slams the phone down mumbles and looks over a file
this the alternative
looking up the what

what exactly are you looking for

this is higher education alternative each one teach one
im looking for alternative school

smiling then you should have no problem
precious doesnt look as convinced
precious neatly writes claireece p
jones on the top of the page
precious sits alone behind a smattering of empty desks in a bright classroom
she looks over her test exhales and starts to write
a ticking clock accompanies
misspelled words eraser shreds tapping feet sweat giant letters tapping thumb tapping pencil frowns giant numbers eraser shreds sighs precious looks up sharply
a square fluorescent light in the ceiling blinks and buzzes as if struggling to stay alive
we tilt down from the blinking light to find that we are in a different place
a younger precious with uncombed hair sits with her back to us in a bright pink dress
she is at the very back of the classroom
the many children seated in front of her are all blurs that gradually fade into darkness while raising their hands
as we drift towards young precious the stains on her dress become more apparent
as we continue drifting the playground voices of other young children echo out
what that on your dress precious
she dont say nuffin
she dont talk to nobody
when the last time yo head was combed
precious mumbles something to herself
shut up precious
you talk funny
you was better when you was on mute
here come the wide load
boys makes a lengthy farting sound triggering a chorus of our drift finally lands on a puddle of urine at her feet
precious peeded herself again
giggles fill the air
a small pencil falls into the puddle making a large ripple
precious pencil point has broken but she still holds the pencil as if about to write
precious sits with an absent look on her face and a bead of sweat on her temple
a moment later a shadow moves over her test
claireece do you need another pencil
the administrator stands over precious waiting for an answer
precious looks up to her blankly
are you finished
precious nods absently
the administrator gently takes the test from precious desk and leaves
precious lingers pensively in the back of the room
there has always been something wrong wif the tesses
precious walks with her hands in her pockets watching the pavement pass beneath her
the tesses paint a picture of me wif no brain
the tesses paint a picture of me an my muver my whole family as less than dumb just ugly black grease to be wiped away punished caged up kilt changed
finded a job for
precious leaves us behind
sometimes i wish i was not alive
i be o
a hand shuts off a shower
a toothbrush lands in a mug
a hairbrush lands on a dresser
thick hands remove a red scarf from a drawer
the clock on the night stand reads
precious sits on the side of her bed fully dressed with red leggings and her red scarf staring at the clock with a notebook in her hands
today is first day
i been tessed
i been incomed eligible
i got my medicaid card proof of address self pencil notebook alla dat shit
when the clock reads she stands turns to a mirror sees a pretty blond white girl and leaves the room
precious stares into the refrigerator
precious stares into the freezer
finally she closes the door
i need some money
sumthin to eat
my head hurt
beat how much you need
beat come and git it then
the air changes
time stands still
a look that is both childlike and gray comes over precious face
large panties fall to the floor from beneath the sheets
marys knees widen beneath the covers
a frozen precious stares across the apartment for a brief eternity
finally she dashes for the front door throws open the locks and bolts out of the apartment slamming the door behind her
where you going
precious walks briskly
the other day i cried felt stupid
fuck that other day
thas why god or whoever make new days
still hungry tho
precious stops and looks up at something
before her stands a fast food restaurant with a giant sign atop it that says kickin fried chicken
precious looks around takes a deep breath and steps inside
precious approaches the counter with a strained nonchalance
a middle aged woman in a hair net waits behind the register
precious sets her notebook and pencil down on the nearest table
what you want baby
give me a basket please
precious eyes wander from the fry bin all the way over to a refrigerator towards the back
watchin the weight you know
the woman chuckles and then leaves for the chicken
the digital clock on the wall reads
precious whirls around to see a young man cigarette in his mouth spraying the door with glass cleaner and then wiping it from the bottom up
precious turns back around to find her server selecting pieces of chicken from a huge tray with large silver tongs
the clock on the wall reads
precious turns to the door again to find the young man still cleaning it
precious turns back around to see her server returning with a basket of chicken
the woman nods sets the chicken on the counter and heads back towards the refrigerator in one fluid motion
the young man wipes the top of the front door and looks to be about finished
precious bursts out of the restaurant with the bucket under one arm and sprints off down the block
a scream from inside follows
a second later reggie the young man who cleaned the glass dashes out after precious
precious looks back while sprinting and scarfing down pieces of chicken at a remarkable rate
across the street sheila reggies pregnant girlfriend screams at him
reggie where you been
ive been paging your tired ass all night
reggie stops dead in his tracks
he lights up a cigarette about faces and prepares for her rant
nigga i knew that was you
and who you running after some fat bitch
get your ass over here
precious turns the corner of th street and onto clayton powell jr
boulevard still devouring chicken
a skinny disheveled man sitting on a standpipe calls out to her
you gon catch indigestion mommie
precious finishes off the chicken at the exact moment she reaches the hotel stuffs the bones and basket into a trash bin and dashes into the building
precious looks at her watch and then freezes as if something terrible has just dawned on her
precious notebook and pencil sit on the table where she left them
precious looks crestfallen
a glance at her watch makes it worse
her stomach growls
she suddenly looks unwell
the elevator doors open
cornrows speaks on the phone while picking her nails
several lines are ringing
she waves from behind her desk as precious walks by
on the phone what else would get away with clouding your mind messin your heart and leaving the goddamn toilet seat up
wait a minute girl
she decides to grab a line
each one teach one hold please
she pushes another line
each one teach one hold
she goes back to her conversation
yeah im back
precious nauseous makes her way down the hallway
precious lunges for a trash bin into which she promptly vomits
she quickly catches her breath
wipes her mouth and looks feet away at a brightness coming from an open doorway
her heart beats loudly
precious stands up
she seems to be there for a considerable spell
a blur of a young girl darts into the room from the other end of the hall without looking at her
alert eyes enters the hallway looking at her watch and then up to precious
precious doesnt respond
are you in the a
this is it
rain looks at her watch beckons precious with one arm and disappears inside
times a wastin
precious still doesnt move
rain appears again
you in or you out
this door closes in thirty seconds
rain disappears again
precious feet finally transport her into the bright doorway
its blinding light envelopes her completely
rains desk sits before six smaller ones situated in a semi circle
four of them are occupied by girls roughly precious age lean seated and dressed like a boy and consuelo montenegro latin descent petite glowing and gorgeous
she twirls her hair incessantly with slender painted fingertips
a seventh desk sits well apart from the others back beneath the windows
the girls all stare up at precious blankly as she enters the room
precious looks to be in a mild state of shock as she gazes around from the girls to ms
rain to the clouds outside the windows
first thing i wonder is where is everybody the boyz the noises this feel like a sunday school or crazy house
or something like bof but different
smell different too
precious eyes land on the lone desk in the rear of the room
have a seat
precious looks from the distant desk to one up front and then back to the distant desk
she sits with the other girls delicately as if she were a visitor in a complete strangers home
rain finishes marking the roll sheet places the cap on her pen and holds up a notebook identical to the one precious left at the kickin fried chicken
does everyone have her notebook
precious sucks her teeth in self disgust as she looks around to find that all the other girls have theirs
jo ann rogers carefree cute and smug then breezes into the room with an air of insubordination
jo ann youre late
jo ann points into her mouth which is full
chewing i had to

the distant desk vanishes over precious shoulder

the room waits
the room continues to wait
i never talked in class before

beat how does it make you feel
precious looks around but seems to be searching inside more than anywhere else
after a moment
it make me feel
the class is quietly taken aback
precious smiles as if having just made it ashore from a ship lost at sea
precious walks off alone still beaming from the new world she has discovered
p before i got a minus in english and never say nuffin never do nuffin
but miz rain say we gonna read and write in our notebooks every day
thas sumthin seeing how we cant really do none of those things and then i think maybe this ain tha class for me
but when miz rain see the worry on my face she look at me and start to talk in chinese
the ghostly image of ms
rain appears on the sidewalk ahead of precious
it is a glimpse from back in the classroom
her voice echoes
the longest journey begins with a single step
rain vanishes and precious shakes her head
whatever the fuck that spozed to mean
this school different okay
but this not star trek neitha
precious continues into the distance
complicated complicated chinese journeys books write n you dont know how
rain writes the letter a on the board and then hands the chalk to jermaine
jermaine writes b and then hands it to consuelo
consuelo writes c and hands it to rhonda
rhonda writes d and hands it to rita
rita takes a step and starts to cry
she drops the chalk
it shatters on the floor
were all in this together rita
rita picks up the largest shard of chalk from the floor and writes e on the board
she hands the chalk to precious and precious writes f
the entire class sits simultaneously and then giggles at their synchronicity
this is just the beginning
why dont we try by ourselves
there are letters in the alphabet
they all have a sound
these letters make up all the words in our language
please open your notebooks write the date and then lets write the alphabet
the girls begin to write
precious soon sets her pencil down moves her hands to her stomach and looks faint
she gathers herself catches her breath and trudges on
this is going to be painless
precious and ms
rain sit close together over a small table looking down at a large colorful childrens book
i just want you to read a page from this book
precious looks up at her blankly and then back down at the book with trepidation
sure lady right after i get voted president
i cant do that miz rain
give it a try
precious looks mortified and starts breathing heavily
laughter screams a razor slicing young flesh sweat and daytime television all assault her minds senses
rain speaks with a dire look of concern on her face but no words come out
she places a hand on precious shoulder and the kaleidoscope of sounds sucks away into the air
the words from ms
rains mouth finally register
honey are you okay
try to relax
should i call an ambulance
what is it
rain looks down perplexed
defeated they all look alike to me
beat the words or the pictures
she sits back for a moment and looks as if shes processing more than just the tragedy of this particular situation but what is that of countless others
in a decisive almost militaristic movement ms
rain sits up again
i think i understand you precious but i still want you to try
youre going to have to push yourself
precious looks back down at the page
there are people of various colors on a beach
what do you think the story is about
peoples at the beach
rain points to the letter a
it is the first word on the page
do you know what that is
rain points to the next word
do you know that word
do you know the letters
rain points to the letters
do you know that word
precious shakes her head
that word is day
rain points to the next word
whats that word
the word is at
rain points at the next word
rain points to the next word
that word is shore
thats almost like beach
can you read the whole thing
a day at the shore
amazed the words that escaped were from her very own mouth precious jaw drops
she whirls to ms
we ease away from the office as the two of them continue working down the page
precious enters the apartment
mary sits on the couch watching the cosbys
bring your fat ass in here
precious suddenly looks exhausted
where you sneak your ass off to this morning
precious doesnt respond
you hear me talking to you
where you sneak your ass off to this morning

at a loss but still angered mary turns back to the television slowly
precious starts for her room until
i ain had no breakfast
precious stops sighs heads to the sink and starts washing her hands
mary talks to precious while watching television
need to forget school

precious dries her hands and reaches for a pan
im gonna get stipend for school and then
fool fuck a stipend
i said take your ass down to welfare
precious stops everything with the pan in her hand

precious shakes her head huffs and turns on the stove
mary then presses the mute button on the remote and whirls around with a cold cigarette between her fingers
oh you too good for that

other ones got trust fund welfares from sploitin po dumb asses like yo dumb ass for centuries
man on tv say lets end firmative action

and while we at it lets take out son in laws country clubs white motherfuckers and then call it a day
precious turns to her mother looking surprised but pensive
marys eyes are still fixed on the tv
now hurry yo ass up
im gon die of starvation over here
then where you be at then
a picturesque plate of pork chops and mashed potatoes
precious delivers it to the couch with a fork and knife
tv sitcom they were watching
precious and mary are well dressed and done up like tv stars

precious sighs and joins mary on the couch
mary hands precious the plate and silverware

precious starts eating slowly
mary lights her cigarette

if i croak off starvation where in the world you be at then
precious eats reluctantly
pots and pans sit drying on the counter
precious wipes her hands on a dishcloth
the room is quiet and empty now
precious stares blankly out of the window
she goes to the television presses the remote and sits down
the cosbys is still on
tired and full she turns the tv off
she watches marys face snoring rhythmically but with extremely unpleasant noises
finally she backs away and goes to her bedroom
precious falls back across her bed with her arms spread
she stares up at the crack in her ceiling
a hand darts into frame touches precious side and then quickly withdraws
precious ignores it
the hand returns for another jab
precious restrains a grin
finally the hand tickles her fiercely
she giggles uncontrollably
the hand belongs to tom cruise
he wears a leather jacket with a cherry red motorcycle helmet tucked under one arm
the helmet has a golden bow stuck on its crown
precious chases him out of frame for some revenge tickling as they both laugh quietly
the helmet falls to the floor with a bounce
claireece would you like to talk about your home life
precious sits on a small couch in a modest office containing bookshelves several plaques and file cabinets
weiss s caucasian conservatively dressed sits across from precious with a clipboard on her lap and glasses low on her nose
a strap hangs down from the glasses and snakes around the back of her neck
what do you want me to say
whatever comes to mind when you think about your home
seem like inquiring white bitches always want to know
i wish i had a tv in my room
beat is that all
my muver is a like a whale person for the couch
she says i eat alla time but then she always makin me eat
and then call me a fat mess
she says apartment is little because of me
she only leaves the house to play the number
sometimes i feel i could just sit there wif her everyday wif the shades drawed watch tv eat watch tv eat

i want to learn more about your father anyway
i dont know much more than you do miz white
he say he the original man like farrakhan be saying but little do he know about it

if you heard that then you heard sumthin else cause i ain said nuffin like it
weiss wariness looks unmoved
now whas next
how about your first child
you havent spoken much about her
precious turns to ms
a doorbell rings
generations enters the apartment in a business like manner with toosie has a bag of groceries in her other arm
precious watches tv beside her mother
both appear as if theyve just woken up
mary attempts to put on her wig and make up
toosie gives mongo to mary whose eyes never leave the television and then hands the groceries to precious who takes them directly to the kitchen as toosie leaves without a
thas short for mongoloid
she got down sinder
you mean she has down syndrome
the child seems only mildly aware of what is going on
the doorbell rings again
precious opens the door
a hispanic woman in her thirties with an attache case enters
as the woman steps inside we see that mary has finished tidying herself
mary and the woman exchange small talk while precious listens
mary has never seemed so congenial
my grandmuver toosie brangs little mongo over on days social worker come so it look like mongo live wif us
then my mama get the check n food stamps for me n little mongo
but its my baby
little mongo is money for me not her
precious continues speaking to ms
weiss from the couch
sometimes i see vampires too
they come for me sometimes and they say that i am one of them
they say precious you belong wif us
how do you respond to them
i say check wif my muver
after that they just look at me and go down through the floor
the family downstairs is vampires so thats where they should go
weiss looks up from her clipboard and over her glasses
precious reflects a moment and then looks up
im going to the doctor now too
miz rain she fall out when she finded out that i ain been to no doctor
whole class scream preenatal at me
they dont know i had my first baby on the kitchen floor wif my muver kicking me upside my head
i mean who would believe
precious snickers reminiscently a moment and then turns to ms
them the kind of thangs you mean when you say talk about whatever come into my mind
weiss looks up and nods through a perplexed daze
precious rides lost in thought
i still dont know why i said all them thangs
i know i wasnt sposed to
tired of lying i guess
hope mama dont find none of it out
she kill me for real cause that be tha end of them welfare checks
the girls burst into frame followed by ms
rain and cornrows and then bound up a large number of steps leading into the led by a spirited guide and trailed by ms
rain and cornrows the girls scrutinize colossal tombs various artifacts hieroglyphics and photographs
miz rain brang us out to see some real old stuff
thangs and stuff before tvs was made before mr
abraham lincoln before miz harriet tubman maybe some stuff before miz weiss even
precious and rita fearfully enter the tomb of perneb
steps in rita grabs precious hand tightly
before we turn tha corner in a mummy tomb rita grab hold of my hand
no one in my life ever do that
beat how rita do it wiffout a thought
rita and jermaine study a sphinx
guide lady smart
say dis the first civilization of the earf
black folks first
jo ann poses like an egyptian hieroglyphic
consuelo examines her nail polish
rain writes briskly across the blackboard
as she makes her way across the frame a barrage of letters and numbers peel off the board fly across the room converge and enter precious forehead
just before the letters and numbers reach precious lifelike holographic images flank them
they are spinning planets a few letters numbers and images try to reach jo ann but most just bounce off of her and fall away
consuelo bats a few mathematical symbols off as if they were flies
finally we land on precious as she confidently stabs her hand into the air to answer a question
precious rides on one of the side seats towards the back while wearing her red scarf
the new yorkers surrounding her are all men of various backgrounds
all wear the exact same suits and raincoats
precious looks up to find two of the businessmen staring down at her
we pan from them and around the bus to find all of the other passengers studying precious in silence as well
i likedd that museum so much i went back by myself
they only look when my belly big
they minds all made
but do they know
they do not know that i am a girl for flowers and thin straw legs
if other peoples could see that the way i do they would see that i am a real person inside
our long circular pan finally lands on precious seat but sitting there now is the pretty blond white girl from precious bedroom mirror wearing precious clothes
the bus grinds to a stop
a man smiles at precious and steps off the bus
the original precious takes the abandoned newspaper from his empty seat and tries to read it
precious stops to watch two society ladies in hats and gloves push antique buggy style baby carriages along the sidewalk
miz rain say the longest journey begin wif a single step
i wonder what step they journeys begin on
mama always talk about how there be all different types of welfare
i want filfy rich white folks welfare
mama crazy but mama not stupid
precious continues observing pensively as the ladies pass a bearded and bedraggled elderly white man laying on the street in tattered clothes
as precious studies him her expression changes ever so slightly
enormous handwritten letters forming not stupid overtake her face as we dissolve to the page upon which she wrote it
precious writes in her notebook
all of the other girls do the same
i am happy to be writing
i am happy to be in school
i am happy to know my baby coming soon
dont see the sense in pretending i am not pregnant anymore
i am also thinking about lil mongo a lot
miz rain say we gonna write everyday that mean home too
and she gonna write back everyday
precious looks up to find jo ann tapping her pencil looking around annoyed and literally at a loss for words
mama say this new school ain shit tho
say you cant learn nuffin writing in no book
gotta git on that computer you want to make some money
but mama wrong about that
i is learning
gonna read to dis baby too and hang colors on its walls
we close in on precious writing as we hear her whisper the following
listen baby muver love you
muver not dumb
listen in a whisper thas the alphabet
twenty six abcdefghijklpmn letters in all
them letters o p q r s t u v w x y z
make up words
them words everything
precious looks up from her page gazing in an otherworldly way
one by one the other girls stop what theyre doing and stare at precious curiously
their eyes turn downward in unison
close on precious legs
a gush of water pours down between them as if it were a tidal wave
the wheels of a speeding gurney waggle to remain straight
fluorescent lights stream by overhead
name tags dangle from the chests of attendants pushing the gurney
one we see belongs to a handsome african american male nurse john mcfadden
he is constantly looking down with a reassuring smile
covered in sweat precious screams without our hearing a sound
two rain drops dance atop a puddle outside
water drips from a tree limb
his name abdul jamal louis jones
his muver love him
john the nurse who helped gurney precious in again stares down warmly at her
this time with abdul in her arms
precious sleeps peacefully
it is still raining outside
rain crochets in the corner
we are close on precious
her eyes focus intently and occasionally dart up and down
nurse john is doing the same thing
his hands lay on top of precious with their palms touching
we glimpse both of their searching eyes again
suddenly precious whips her hands over and slaps the back of johns before he can pull them away
that hurt girl
get to x ray
leaving maybe i will
you gon have to if you dont practice
the girls from class ogle him from another part of the room as he leaves and then nudge and bicker with each other for pole position to hold abdul
dear miz rain all the years i sit in class i never learn but now i got baby again by my fahver
behind the girls precious sits up in bed writing in her journal
i wish i had a boyfriend like other girls and then id feel right that i have to quit school
i love my baby but want school too
precious closes her book
jo ann backs away from the others takes the notebook and then leaves
rhonda returns abdul to precious
the remaining girls embrace precious one at a time and then file out of the room
as the girls stream into the classroom jo ann sets precious notebook on ms
rain opens it immediately
rain writes at her desk
dear precious i am glad you love your baby
i think a beautiful young girl like you should have a chance to get an education
i think your first responsibility has to be to yourself
you should not drop out of school
precious reads from her journal
come back to class
we miss you
love ms rain
precious immediately writes back
dear miz rain
rain sits on the corner of bed reading precious journal
social worker ask me if i want to give little mongo and abdul up for adoption
i could kill her
she never help before
now she want to take my kids away
if she take abdul i wont have nothing nomore
jo ann bounds into the room with the journal in her hand swipes an apple from precious tray and takes a bite
precious snatches the journal and opens it quickly
dear precious it seems the opposite to me
if you keep abdul you might have nothing
you are learning to read and write that is everything
come back to school when you get out of the hospital
youre only seventeen
your whole life is in front of you
toosie paces precious hospital room briskly while holding abdul and lecturing precious fiercely
dear miz rain grandmuver come visit and say only a dog will drop a baby and walk off
say later not even a dog
precious grandmother continues her sermon
dear precious you are not a dog
you are a wonderful young woman who is trying to make something of her life
i have some questions for you
where was your grandmother when your father was abusing you
where is little mongo now
what is going to be the best thing for you in this situation
rain sits at her desk reading with her pen ready
dear miz rain lot of questions you ask
no muver no grandmuver and father rape me years
little mongo wif my grandmuver
best for me to stop breaving sometimes i think
i want to be a good mother too tho
rain writes immediately
dear dear precious being a good mother might mean letting your baby be raised by someone who is better able than you to meet the childs needs
precious writes while breast feeding abdul
dear miz rain i is best able to meet my childs need
the page turns
the page falls
the students are all at their desks reading
rain writes the following
dear precious when you are raising a small infant you need help
who is going to help you
how will you support yourself
how will you keep learning to read and write
we drift towards mary at one with the couch watching television
one hand holds a cigarette while the other mines an enormous bag of potato chips elbow deep
her greasy mouth remains occupied with either a cigarette a potato chip or both at all times
the welfare help mama it help me
dear precious miss when you get home from the hospital look and see how much welfare has helped your mother
nurse john and precious sit quietly
nurse john hands her an envelope
precious opens the envelope to find a beautiful card
it reads god bless you
there is a bill inside
she looks up at him teary eyed and grateful
precious now wearing her jacket packs up her things takes abdul and heads out of a spotless room with her child in one hand and two bags in the other
precious rides holding abdul
you could go further than your mother
you could get your g
and go to college
you could do anything precious but you have to believe it
love blu rain
precious heads into the main entrance holding abdul and her bags as snowflakes start to fall
ruby plays alone with her broken barbie doll
precious passes her without a word
ruby springs to her feet to trail her
that your new baby
what its name
can i hold it
ruby can only watch as precious disappears into the stairwell
signs on the elevators read out of order
precious climbs the stairs growing short of breath holding abdul her bags and her coat folded over one arm
once on the landing she searches for her keys while trying to balance abdul and everything else
after turning several locks she pushes into the apartment
looks up and ducks
a flying vase barely misses precious and abdul and then shatters against the wall
a plant comes next
precious barely dodges that one too and she drops everything but abdul
mary charges into frame to ram precious and abdul like a bull
precious sidesteps the charge as mary leaves a huge indentation in the wall knocking over a side table and a potted plant in the process
she grabs her shoulder in pain
precious backs away around the living room to flee
mary hurls whats left of the plant at precious from down on the floor
precious turns her back to shield abdul
the pot strikes her in the back
abdul screams louder
dirt covers precious
as mary gets to her feet
tears well in precious eyes
mary growls and charges precious again
precious turns the tv over between them
electrical sparks fly as it hits the floor
there is a banging at the door
mary leave that chile alone
stop beating that girl mary
mary trips and crashes down on top of the overturned television
precious dashes out of the apartment with only abdul as mary struggles to get up
precious dashes out of the apartment with tears in her eyes dirt on her clothes no coat and abdul screaming in her arms
a little old woman stands in the hallway shaking her head in disgust
precious looks back trips on the landing and tumbles down a flight of steps cradling and shielding abdul all the way
a hard floor abruptly halts precious descent
she checks abdul immediately
he is smiling
a door opens followed by grunts and a crash
precious looks up to find the broken television tumbling down the steps towards them
at the last second precious manages to roll them both out of the way as the television crashes to the landing shattering some more
precious bursts out of the stairwell with blood streaming down her nose and abdul in her arms
ruby dashes to intercept them
precious what happened
ruby places herself between precious and the door while moving
precious however is in a big hurry
precious could i see your baby now
i just wanna see
precious shows no sign of slowing down
ruby looks concerned
precious whats wro
precious knocks ruby out of her way and to the floor without losing stride
ruby lands hard and cries loudly
abdul still in her arms precious heads away from the building under dressed
the falling snow has thickened considerably
as she makes her way into the distance precious walks into the snowstorm carrying abdul
she hears the sound of a choir
she approaches the church basement where the voices are coming from
precious stares through the window where choir members are praising the lord
mary barrels into precious bedroom yelling and screaming as she turns the place upside down
she rips down precious handprints along with her cyndi lauper poster
she then picks up a brush and hurls it into precious mirror shattering it to pieces
precious with abdul in her arms is singing along with the choir happier than ever
tom cruise joins in clapping the stray dog that licked precious in the beginning at his side
precious sits on the steps of a hospital
snow still falling
she looks confused
precious steps out of an elevator wet from the snow and still splattered with dirt
she approaches a desk with urgency
i need to see nurse john
where nurse john at
hes on break
hell be back soon
have a seat
precious sits on one of a row of chairs by the wall
she tries to settle abdul as he starts to cry
the skinny nurses legs approach and stop in front of precious
you dont remember me do you
precious looks up to find a sour looking woman glaring down at her
i delivered your last one
precious pauses as if searching for a response to satisfy this woman
precious looks away
the nurse doesnt leave
you know im sorry to see you back here
beat i remembered hoping that you would have learned from your mistakes
you dont know me bitch
get lost fore i kick your ass
the nurse finally starts away
the nurse turns around
i aint make no mistake unless it was being born
the elevator doors open
john steps off between precious and the nurse
precious starts to rise and john motions for her to stay seated
he sits beside her
my mama kick my ass again
i ain giving abdul away
and i ain gonna stop school
john looks concerned
precious speaks with great resolve as if forcing herself to believe her words
im gonna get little mongo back too
sighs i dont hardly even know what she look like now
dont matter tho
that dont matter
john looks on heavy hearted
precious is dressed in a hospital gown and draped in a wool blanket
it is still snowing
john holds an umbrella over precious and a bag in one hand as he escorts her out onto the driveway and into a large gray van
john places the bag in the van hugs precious closes the door and then waves as the van pulls away
precious turns to watch him recede into the snow through the back window
nurse john say lots of people get out of hospital wif no place to go
his eyes look worried tho
wonder what next
precious rides in darkness cradling abdul
she looks up frightened taking in the others sitting around her
shes hold abdul closer
the dark swallows her whole
bare light bulbs hang from the ceiling
precious lays on a bed breast feeding abdul and staring up at the ceiling while covered in a blanket
we sail away to find they are surrounded by scores of rudimentary beds many of which are filled with other women of varying ages
a bug lady lies next to her with unkempt hair and sores on her skin
murmuring put your bags in bed with you
put your bags in the bed with you
put em in
tuck em in bed with you
the skinny woman on the other side sits up and grabs herself feverishly as if there were bugs allover her
an enormous and ferocious looking woman in her forties steps up snatches the blanket off of precious and abdul and walks off
give the chile back her blanket
i ain giving back shit
the woman walks away
physically and emotionally spent precious sighs and then lifts her beds top sheet beneath which is a plastic covered mattress
she then wraps the sheet around abdul and herself and hunkers down
precious rocks abdul gently as her eyes wander around the cavernous armory
humming singing softly now i know my abcs tell me what you think of me
precious kisses abdul on the head
miz rain say i was moving through the vowel n consonant sounds faster than even rhonda johnson was
maybe couldve even catched up to jermaine
precious sleeps soundly
something nudges her slightly
when she finally opens her eyes
abdul is gone
so is her bag
precious springs up in a panic turning in every direction
where my baby
where my baby at
the bug lady casually points to the exit
the large ferocious woman heads for the exit with abdul in one arm and precious bag in the other
she looks down at abdul making baby faces and sounds
precious dashes after her but winces in pain grabbing her pelvic area along the way
the bug lady follows precious as a speed walker might
precious snatches abdul and promptly knees the ferocious woman hard in the gut
the ferocious woman moans as she falls to the ground
precious continues kicking and stomping her without abandon
the bug girl observes stoically
as she trounces the woman precious eyes fill with a rage we havent yet seen
finally two other women pull precious away while she still kicks at the woman
the ferocious woman now bloodied falls over on her back with her eyes closed and her mouth hanging open
a bright morning skyline stretches over the hotel theresa
rain at work a little earlier than usual this morning looks great and ready for another day
rain enters the lobby
the window of the entry door has been smashed
she opens the door with a look of trepidation
rain steps into her classroom carrying two bags
she removes her sunglasses
the sight before her stops her in her tracks
she drops her bags immediately
it is precious sleeping on the floor with abdul in her arms
her hand is cut and bleeding pretty bad
rain looks incensed
precious sits rocking abdul with a bandaged hand
rain still fuming sits on the other side of the office dialing a phone number from a list on the wall
i can tell by miz rains face that i ain gonna be homeless no more
only i ain so sure where im gon end up tho
sternly yes ill hold
grumbling while on hold safety net huh

i feels really sorry for her

but she all i could think of
rhonda jermaine and consuelo appear in the doorway
they start for abdul immediately
rain stops them just as quickly
good morning girls

whichever one of you is older is in charge until i get back
and consuelo i know that is not you
so here is
rain digs into her purse to find the money
she hands it to consuelo
go get something for precious to wear
and bring me back my change
the girls nod and leave
rhonda and jermaine head off down the hall
how old you is
same age as you

i asked you first
rain still waits on hold until
well why didnt you tell me that before
im sitting here half the ms
rain slams the phone down shakes her head finds another number on the wall and then dials again while speaking to precious
before this day is up you will have a place to live precious
rain suspends her frustration with a brief smile as she waits for the other end of the line to pick up
jo ann saunters in
the other girls are writing already
rhonda is at the head of the class displaying unusually good posture
looking at her watch jo ann you late

rain takes an organizer from her bag looks for another number and picks up the phone

with uncertainty well see what they can do
precious exits the girls bathroom carrying abdul
she sports a new sweat suit
she pauses before entering each one teach one reception area and observes ms
rain speaking on the phone for a moment
suzanne the schools administrator stands by
precious jumps and turns around to find cornrows passing by

rain picks up the line holding
rain hangs up the phone turns to precious and exhales
they can take you
at a place here in harlem
precious looks relieved
you just need somewhere to stay tonight
beat you dont snore do you
precious sits at a small kitchen table in a modest but cozy and craftily decorated apartment
fresh flowers adorne her table
she breast feeds abdul and drinks from a tall glass of grape juice
rain clears the table of plates and take out containers
woman who it seems has just awoken descends the stairs
shes not in a good mood
honey how many times did i tell you about the music
she stops in mid sentence when she sees precious
her mood changes
warmly you must be precious
katherine bends down to admire abdul
precious this is my wife katherine
precious looks confused
she spits her drink out
a lot of which lands on abdul
she wipes abdul
i said that this is my wife katherine
precious mouth is agape
smiling at abdul whats his name
he looks just like you
beat yall really married
precious still looks confused
the ladies lounge around the living room
rain and katherine hold glasses of wine
precious still looks as if shes trying to keep up

together these homo ladies its called an analogy

im glad abdul here to used to smoke like a chimney listen in on em tho cause i and drink like a fish before know they smart
he got saved
an etta james tune begins
rain and katherine high from the wine spin each other lazily in a playful dance
precious sits watching carefully
she lifts and smells the gardenias from the table
precious starts to pour a bottle of wine into her glass
mama say homos is bad peoples
a hand intercepts the bottle
it is ms
she then pours it into her own glass and takes the bottle with her as she returns to katherine
but homos not who rape me homos not who let me sit up in school years and learn nuffin and homos not sell crack to peoples in harlem
i wonder what oprah have to say about that
rain looks over to precious
you okay precious
y all watch oprah
rain gives her a loving smile
miz rain the one who put the chalk in my hand make me queen of abcs
precious smiles back with gratitude and great affection
rain and katherine continue dancing in the window as precious observes
the evening cityscape sparkles around them
streamers hang from the walls
various handwritten versions of congratulations precious obviously written by the girls stretch across the blackboard in uneven sized letters
precious stands beside ms
rain holding a small trophy and a check
the other girls flank them standing very straight
all wear big grins
nurse john without his uniform has just taken a picture of everyone
the girls go straight for the cookies and punch waiting atop an orange tablecloth on ms
they begin a soul train line and dance around the desk as nurse john approaches ms
rain to converse
after i settle in halfway house i work my hardest to memorize letter sounds write in journal and read smaller and fatter books
then i find out mayors office give me literacy award and check for progress
everybody at the party nurse john cornrows and the staff stop in too but they need to get back to they desks before too long
whole operation cant stop just cause miss precious get a trophy
john discreetly beckons precious over to the side as she blows into a noisemaker
both she and john dance in high spirits
john hands precious a giftwrapped present
she shakes it and then opens it
it is a leather bound journal with blank pages
precious flips through it
thanks nurse john
they exchange a familiar moderately complicated handshake
what are you gonna do with your award money
i owe the chicken place for a bucket that i swiped last year
after that get some thangs for abdul
you know blu
precious holds up two intertwined fingers
well she has has she uh
got a man
well i was hoping you could put in the good word
the good word
yeah thats what im trying to say
you aint her type
john looks confused
precious leads john down the hall by the hand
she stops in front of cornrows desk as cornrows converses on the phone while picking her nails
the previously illegible sign on her desk now reads each one on the phone noticing precious hold on girl
cornrows lowers the phone and waits for precious to speak
miss lisa this nurse john
nurse john this miss lisa
cornrows looks up at john
precious heads back to the party
nurse john and cornrows watch her curiously
yall work it out
nurse john and cornrows turn to each other
how are you
cornrows looks him up and down then hangs up the phone without looking
i get off at
the room is empty except for ms
rain standing on a chair taking streamers down
precious appears in the doorway and studies ms
rain a moment as if seeing her for the first time
rain steps down from her chair looking tired
precious enters the room
precious i thought you went home
i forgot to say thank you for my party
it was my pleasure
precious just watches her
was there something else
beat are you sure
well i was thinking
you talk to us girls in the class when we be working out problems and thangs and stuff right
rain speaks to precious while picking up around the room
well who do you talk to
caught off guard ms
rain looks at precious curiously
quickly or you probably dont have no problems so
everybody has those precious
rain some folks just got it made in the shade
it only looks that way
yes i talk to people all the time for support
i didnt have nobody to really speak wif for a long time
i know how that be sometimes so thas why i asked cause almost evrybody need a little help once in a
rain abruptly stops what shes doing
precious looks alarmed
what on earth are you talking about
only that well evrybody need a little help once in a
scared i jus
you just what
terrified i just thought that if you might need some
youve helped me already
precious looks both confused and relieved
rain sits while motioning for precious to do the same
precious stops as ms
rain looks away as if gathering her thoughts
last night i had a conversation with my mother and that never happens cause our relationship is
we dont speak and when we do it always ends in a fight about my filthy misguided existence
most times i feel terrible for days afterwards wondering whether all the hateful things she said are true
those days i just feel like
i didnt feel so bad this time though
beat cause this time i thought about how strong youve had to be and then i decided that i had nothing to be ashamed of and that my mother was
wrong about me my dad and or hundred other things
you ask if you can help me
baby you already have
thats the for real hope to die if im lying truth
now shouldnt you be out the door
i jus help you finish up first
i got some time
standing suit yourself
rain motions to the other end of a long folding table
precious takes hold of it and they carry it across the room together
as we watch from a distance
some folks got a light around them that shine for other peoples
i think maybe some of them was in a long tunnel before
and in that tunnel maybe the only light they had was one that was inside of them and then even long after they escaped that tunnel they still be shining
for everybody else
thas miz rain to me
precious trophy sits on the windowsill beneath a thin a layer of dust
a stack of books sit on her bureau
colorful letters and numbers hang on the wall
beneath them hang postcards featuring zora neal hurston alice walker maya angelou and oprah winfrey
abdul sleeps in his crib
precious makes her bed
in a book i read a lady escaped to a way house
and the lady she asked the people there just what a way house was
they tole her you is way between the life you had and the life you want to have thas nice
that also mean i cant stay here forever and that there is still a ways to go
it be something to get apartment of my own
a larger abdul steps towards us with precious behind him wearing a cotton dress that looks vaguely like one ms
rain might wear
abdul nine months old and walking
i been reading to him since the day he was born almost
barely talkin and he countin
precious plays with abdul in the shallow end of the community swimming pool
mama daddy i
iii and lenox avenue already seem like a past life or some old bad dream
i wish i could have started out from here but still wif abdul and poor mongo
precious looks out of her open window with a glass of water in her hand
precious closes her window
the door to her room opens
chelsea a s mething social worker steps in looking slightly uncomfortable
you have a visitor
she always early
i shouldve said cause then that way
its not rhonda
precious descends a staircase to a long corridor clearly deep in thought every step of the way
she stops momentarily to straighten her clothes
when she finally reaches a day room at the other end of the hall she looks through its window for a moment
mary sits inside crushing and dwarfing the couch upon which she waits
she looks frail
her wig is half combed
her sweaty hands crumple her cigarette package
precious covers her nose a moment lowers her hand readies herself and then steps into the room
once inside the room and for the first time precious soft face looks like stone
mary looks up with a brief but quickly fading smile that is pathetic apologetic and grim
the air is thick without a single word between them
finally mary looks down
your daddy dead
precious looks surprised for a moment but still composed
mary waits for a response
is that all
carl had that aids virus
a previously unseen woman sitting across the room looks up from behind a newspaper
precious stays stone faced until she finally gasps as the aftershock of the revelation hits her squarely
the man across the room collects his hat and coat and leaves
we return to the dayroom as precious opens her eyes and lifts them to mary slowly
you got it
the aids virus
how you know
we never did you know
no i dont know mama
we never did what you got to do to get it
he never been wif you
but not like faggots in the ass and all so i know
precious is speechless
it looks as if some of her anger has suddenly been displaced with pity
you better go to the doctor ma
mary looks up delicately
you welcome back home
im home here
beat i better go see bout abdul and do homework
mary doesnt move as precious leaves
mary sits staring at the floor at the far side of the room
precious enters takes abdul from his crib holds him closely and sits on her bed
moments later a tapping on the window draws her attention
precious rises to find tom cruise hurling pebbles up at her window in a leather jacket
a motorcycle sits a few feet away from him
he beckons her
she stares down at him with solemn eyes
tom finally mounts his bike and vanishes into thin air while revving its engine
mary then crosses the frame where he was
precious turns to abdul and kisses him on the head
precious walks over the crest of a hill deep in thought with her hands in her pockets
the constant hum of the city seems lower than usual as precious footsteps make the most prominent sound
from this distant view it appears as if she is almost walking in place
rain stands before the blackboard with a piece of chalk in her hand pointing to the word unrelenting which is written behind her
consuelo is missing and two new girls aisha indian and from guyana and bunny very thin with bad teeth have joined the class
rita what do i mean when the author describes her protagonists circumstances as unrelenting
i dont know miz rain
cmon rita think about the question before you just give up like that
rains voice trails off as we find precious lost in thought
precious waits in a small gray office
a female counselor with sympathetic eyes carrying a file sits across from her
her eyes say everything
the counselor places a hand on top of precious
all the girls write in their journals except for precious who again looks preoccupied
rain watches her
precious doesnt respond
the entire class looks up at precious
rain waits for a response
precious bring your journal to me
precious waits a moment and then shakes her head without looking up
rain goes to her desk and picks up the journal without resistance
the words why me
sit alone on the page with lines crossed through them
rain returns the journal to precious desk still opened to the same page
precious would you come to my office for a moment
precious doesnt respond
the class still watches curiously
rain steps back sits on the edge of her desk and folds her arms
preci nurse say i am h
the air changes sharply
i dont have nuffin to write today and i dont hate no one
not even my muhver
my head is all dark inside so i dont have nuffin to write today
maybe nuffin never
rita rises walks to precious and embraces her
tears well in precious eyes
still trying to stay composed precious wipes her face
rain rises walks to precious and rubs her back as she looks around to the other girls who are still stunned
your baby okay
the class waits on pins and needles
precious doesnt answer at first and just looks down until
wont bress feed him no more to be safe
to precious one time in your journal you told me that you had never really told your story
precious eyes well up some more
she wipes her face again
i feel like i am drowning inside a giant river miz rain
precious stops herself abruptly as if being overwhelmed by a sense of futility
i think telling your story will get you over that river precious
precious erupts hurling her journal sharply across the room
it bounces hard off the blackboard and stops abruptly on the floor facedown
the class looks shocked
precious wet eyes are filled with fury
a moment later ms
rain walks calmly across the room retrieves the journal and places it back on top of precious desk
open your notebook precious
exasperated im tired miz rain
i know you are but you cant stop now
you gotta fight through this
you still have to live your life and do the best you can with the hand youve been dealt
if not for yourself then for the people who love you
precious huffs cynically
nobody love me
thas a lie
people do love you precious
please dont lie miz rain
love rape me beat me call me animal get me sick and make me feel wurfless
i had enough love
that wasnt love
there are people in this room who love you
your child loves you too
is that clear precious
now if rita decided to just give up
would you let her
precious doesnt answer
and why not
precious doesnt answer
because you love her
as much as she loves you
precious looks to her side and finds rita smiling reassuringly through her crooked teeth
now the rest of the world can judge you cheat you beat you dismiss you and abandon you all it wants but we wont let you give up and thats
the only thing that matters
some people have less than that on their side and still manage to keep going
beat its up to you
precious thinks a long moment wipes her face and exhales
she doesnt move for what seems like ages
the whole class watches her until ms
rain motions for them to continue working
finally precious takes hold of her pen opens her journal sighs deeply and starts to write again
our young ladies and ms
rain are seated around a picnic table eating laughing talking and writing in their journals all at the same time
precious has found friends
as we watch rhonda
some things is hard to say and maybe not your business no way but rhondas brother rape her for years and when her muhver fine out she throw rhonda out
as we watch rita smiling
ritas daddy kill her muhver in front of her eyes and rita been out on the street selling herself since she
as we watch jermaine laughing
jermaine say mens beat her and then rape her for what she is
muhver throw her out the house when she fine out that she different from other girls
as we watch ms
miz rain still a sort of mystery but a nice one like the sun
as we watch the group from a distance
miz rain right too
these girls is my family now
they visit me at hospital when i had abdul and even take up a collection when mama kick me out
they got love in they eyes and in they hearts for me same as i got for them
weiss speaks from behind her desk as precious sits on the couch beside her backpack looking bored
you know you can use your notebook between sessions claireece
i mean you can use it specifically for trying to recover certain early memories
precious nods mechanically
tired of this lady asking me questions
miz rain say talk anyway but miz weiss just a spy for the state who write reports on me undercover
reports go in file
file say what i could get where i could go and if i could get cut off and kicked out of advancement house
beat what are you thinking
oh i doubt that claireece
it seems like youre always thinking about something
i dont know
its sort of hot in here i guess
it is isnt it
as a matter of fact im going to get myself something to drink
would you like something to drink claireece
a soda sounds nice
i dont care
oh cmon you must
weiss collects some change grins at precious and then steps out of the room leaving her purse open on the desk
back in a jiffy
the moment the door closes precious dashes across the room for the file cabinet behind ms
precious searches the drawers in the cabinet and rifles through the files
weiss inserts several pieces of change into a vending machine and presses a button
a can of soda clunks down through the bowels of the machine
pouring through the j files precious stops at jones and then first goes for p
she sees nothing sucks her teeth thinks a moment and then looks for c
weiss saunters back towards the office whistling softly with sodas in her hand
precious finally finds the file with her name on it and looks up as footsteps sound outside the door
weiss steps in
precious is now seated on the couch again with a corner of her file protruding from her bookbag
weiss hands precious her soda
you know your mothers been calling here wanting to come visit
would you like her to come to a counseling session with you
i dont know
i never really thought about it before
well thats just one more thing to consider before i see you next week
weiss smiles at precious
precious smiles back
jermaine rocks abduls crib with one hand while looking at the file with precious as both girls sit cross legged on precious bed
precious reads carefully
i have just finished a session with claireece precious jones an eighteen year old african american female
according to her teachers at each one teach one where she attends school she is a pen phen phenomenal success
having made strides so tre men tremendous in the past year she was given the mayors award for outstanding achievement
she seems actively en
engaged in all aspects of the learning process
however her tabe test scores are disappointingly low
not to miz rain
not to miz rain
continuing she scored
on her last test
miz rain get a grip and gon read the report and dont get all emotional about what this silly hoe got to say
anyway if your shit wasnt dope you wouldnt be standing up here readin what whats her name looks up on the page
weiss got to say
she will need at least an
before she can enter g
class and begin work toward her high school e q
surprised and impressed jermaine double takes on precious
beat abdul is the clients second born child
hes from all outwhere
appearances a healthy and welladjusted toddler
precious attends to his needs a s s i d u o s l y
precious and jermaine look at each other
both are at a loss
and with great affection and ee
eagerly seeks any and all information on child rearing
the time and resources it would require for this young woman to get a g
or into college would be considerable
precious stops reading abruptly and hands the file to jermaine
jermaine looks at precious oddly
finish reading this
i know whats coming
jermaine pauses and then continues reading the file as precious rises and paces the room
although she is in school now it is not a job readiness program
nonetheless claireece is capable of going to work
in january her son will be two years old
in keeping with the new initiative on welfare reform i feel claireece would benefit from any of the various workfare programs in existence
despite her obvious intellectual limitations she is quite capable of working as a home attendant
i dont want to be no motherfucking home attendant
i wanna be
my rapp o r t with precious is minimal
although i am not sure with whom she evidently has access to counseling services provided by each one teach one
she has a history of sexual abuse and is h
she say she not put that in my file
thats the bitchs job to get the mofuckin goods on you
continuing the client seems to view the social services afdc as taking care of her forever
jermaine sets the file down and looks up at precious
beat that file do show one thing that
this hoe dont know nuffin wurf knowing about claireece precious jones
im getting my g
a job and a place for me and abdul then i go to college
i dont want to home attend nobody
you better put this shit back before you get in trouble
we talk about it with ms
rain in the morning
precious hurries into a room carrying abdul
the sign on the door says daycare
precious dashes out of the room alone
and dont be coming back late for his bad ass neither
precious marches to school with her bookbag and red scarf
she clearly has a lot on her mind
miz weiss just part of the gang but definitely not cool
and social worker look at me like i am ugly freak who did something to make my own life like it is
i guess i am trying to figure out just what has happened to me while miz weiss just hell bent on making me go wipe old peoples asses
precious crosses the street
got to sort dis out quick tho fore abduls next birthday coming up fast
the whole class writes until ms
rain looks at her watch and
time is up
does anyone want to share
the only hand up belongs to precious
i dont really want to read all i wrote i jus wanna kinda say what it is im writing about and how it came about
well to make a long story short the counselor at advancement house quizzing me about mama and daddy etc
but its really about workfare
she want to send me out as home attendant
how you know
cause i stole my file from advancement house and read it
the class gasps
next time get mines too
all this what you wanna be
and you can talk to me
they ain no motherfucking therapists on our side they just flunkies for the fare
i wanna work but not for no motherfucking welfare check in central park displacing brothers and sisters who really got jobs cleaning up cause im there working for free
jermaine speaks while slouched in her chair with her feet crossed and arms folded
and what kinda shit is it for someone like precious to have quit school before she get her g
to work at some live in job for some old ass crackers
shell never make a rise she get stuck in some shit like that
sit up straight jermaine and watch your language
both of you
jermaine reluctantly sits up
now i see your points but is stealing
miz rain if i didnt steal that file i wouldnt know what i was facing
you read the whole thing by yourself
rhonda home attend
say old bitch would ring a bell when she want rhonda in the night
rhonda used to have to go all the way out to brighton beach where she work for them people
the people had her there all day and night on call they call it
but you only get pay for hours so thats x
referring to her notebook
a day but then you is not really getting that much cause you is working more than eight hours a day
you is working hours a day and
divided by is
referring to her notebook
by my count
rhonda say old bitch would ring a bell a actual bell when she want rhonda in the night
home attendants usually work six days a week
i would only see abdul on sundays
when would i go to school
beat am i gonna hafta go be home attendant like rhonda was
so stop worrying about it
well cross that bridge when we get to it
trust me no trust yourself
my concern now is that if this ms
weiss is someone youre working with and cant trust shes out
we gotta find somebody else
beat well i just write in my notebook till i get wif some kinda therapist i can trust
actually that always help me more than talking to her
plus im going to start going to meetings wif rita for insect survivors
thats what i mean
well it aint what you been saying
whats the big deal
ones where your family molest you the other is like a roach or bugs
precious have you ever had your hearing tested
i never really had nothing tested
nothing like that
glasses is what i really want so my eyes dont hurt when i be reading at night
the sound of a rumbling bus engine accelerating leads us to
rita looks out the window of a moving bus and then steps across the aisle and sits beside precious who stares out the window pensively
rita and me on our way
i look at subway map sometimes and wonder where i be if i go to the end of the line
jermaine say there be a white boy wif a baseball bat when you get off
rita say its not true or if it be true its only part true
the bus comes to a stop and the girls dash out the back door
precious and rita climb up out of the subway
precious and rita walk with precious looking around as rita hums quietly
in a simple meeting room women of all different ages colors and strata sit in a large circle
sparkling eyes stands
hello and welcome to our tuesday night beginners meeting

her jaw drops

she looks around as if seeing from the top of a mountain
finally she clears her throat and then
i was raped by my father and beat by my mother ever since i could remember anything at all
raped and beat by both
the worst part about it
the part even worse than them doin it

precious looks around the room to find herself surrounded by understanding eyes

irene nods and precious sits
rita squeezes her hand
another woman stands up to recount her story
precious looks aglow
everything is floating around me now
like geeses from the lake
i see flying
thank you rita for getting me here on time
the group slowly emerges
a table with a nice arrangement of cookies stands next to a coffee maker and soda machine
irene chats with candace over a cup of coffee
precious and rita talk with two other young women miriam black s long pretty dreadlocks and lisa white s
how you get your hair like that
oh you like it
i do yours one day if you want
thats what i do fix peoples hair and makeup
miriam hands precious a card
precious reads the card carefully and puts it away with care
thank you miriam
to precious do you want another hot chocolate
precious smiles and shakes her head no
rita gets up
precious watches her go as miriam and lisa chat
rita ask me do i want another hot chocolate
i do but i dont want to be greedy even if her boyfriend do give her money
precious looks around at all of the other girls
im alive inside
a bird is my heart
mama and daddy didnt win
im drinking hot chocolate on the upper west side with girls all kind who love me
how does a stranger meet me and love me
rita returns with two cups of hot chocolate
she gives one to precious
precious thanks rita with her eyes
precious wearing her new scarf and glasses sits in the waiting room holding a book in her hands
abdul plays among the little children in the kids area behind her
crumpled wrapping paper lays beside her
the books first page reads sheila and ruby walk in and sit down beside precious
ruby has a black eye
they sit in silence for a few moments waiting for their turn
sheila hewitt ms
rubenstein is ready for you
to ruby go on back there
but there are no kids there i can play with
do you want me to knock your other eye out
just sit there and shut up then
im going to talk to this lady before my shit gets cut off
sheila heads up the stairs toward the offices
precious closes her book
its cover reads chrystal stair selected works by langston hughes
clareece precious jones
weiss is ready for you
precious stands up and looks down at ruby sulking in her chair
she leans down gives her a big hug and tenderly fixes rubys hair
precious walks off toward the stairs but stops when she passes a mirror hanging on the wall
within the reflection she sees her true self for the first time
one day miz rain ask us to write about our ideal self
i wrote that i would be light skinned and small wif wavy swing job hair
she heads up the stairs toward the offices
beat miz rain read all that and then say i am beautiful like i am
i never believe her before but somehow today this moment cant say why i do
the inside i thought was so beautiful is a black girl too
precious turns around to find that ruby has grabbed her arm
she then reaches up and hugs precious tightly
through the embrace precious finds herself facing the many mirrors on display by the old man on the folding chair
in her reflections she sees the skinny white girl who she has frequently imagined herself as gradually transform into the real precious one by one
we tilt down upon a stately pre war building bathed in stark wintry light
perhaps we should begin by talking a little bit about the abuse
mary looks worse than ever
her hair and clothing are disastrous
she rocks somewhat anxiously on the edge of her seat like a desperate salesman looking to close a deal
there was no drugs in ma house
cause precious know damn well i whoop her ass bright blue if she bring some drugs in ma
im referring to inappropriate acts of a physical and sexual nature involving precious

precious stands abruptly startling both women

precious leans and kisses mary tenderly on the cheek turns and gently touches ms
precious takes a good look at them both smiles and leaves the room
weiss calls after her
precious keeps walking
precious doesnt stop
the women run to the window
they see precious burst out onto the street
precious walks down the crowded street carrying mongo and andre
she is happy and filled with hope
tom cruise is there chatting up another young girl
she pays him no mind
for precious girls everywhere
