written by dan futterman based on the book capote a biography by gerald clarke title up western kansas the camera follows a sixteen year old girl long hair pretty sunday
church dress walking toward a peaceful farmhouse
at the door she lifts the knocker
the door opens slightly
the girl turns and looks past the camera at her mother sitting in an old plymouth idling in the driveway
her mother shrugs motions for her to go inside
the girl walks through the downstairs rooms
in the kitchen the phone is off the hook
the girl looks back toward the open front door
she turns toward the stairs climbs them
she walks down the hall to a bedroom door at the end
the door is slightly ajar
she knocks then enters the room
the girls pov the camera pans across the bedroom of a high school coed
we see the desk the bureau the bed
on the bed lies nancy clutter her wrists and legs bound in rope shot in the head
there is blood on the wall
the sixteen year old girl stands immobile
before she starts to scream trees ring the edge of a field
buildings lit against the night sky
camera follows group of partygoers as they mount the stairs truman capote barbara very tall rose christopher williams
the friends are standing in the crowded kitchen people are coming in and out talking and drinking and laughing
so jimmy baldwin tells me the plot of his book and he says to me the writings going well but i just want to make sure its not one of

their attention is pulled back into the group as who would i want to play me
sort of middle class

beat marilyn monroe
barbara cracks up chokes on her drink
truman sits with his coffee reading the new york times
an article catches his eye
he sits up straight folds the paper over reads it
c u of article being snipped out of page of the times november
as the page gets turned around with each snip we see a small photo of a middle aged man wearing glasses with the caption found dead herbert w

parts of the story holcomb kan
wheat farmer his wife
two young children found shot today
truman on the phone
new yorker magazine
william shawn please
he listens adorable one
all of a sudden i know what article im going to write for you next
truman on the phone on a long cord travels between the study and the kitchen as he talks to william shawn
we hear pieces of the conversation and see truman in different parts of the room as he says each bit
never had anything like this happen to them before
theyre used to sleeping at night with the doors unlatched
laughs yes we should buy stock in master locks all of kansas will be in the hardware store tomorrow
jump to they have no idea who the killer is
but it doesnt matter who the killer is what matters is who the townspeople imagine the killer is
thats what i want to write about
jump to im gonna need some help
im thinking about nelle she can protect me
jack dunphy strong irish american ten years older than truman his longtime boyfriend enters the front door with a bag of groceries stops in the hall
he sees truman on the phone
truman looks at jack though hes still speaking to shawn i want to leave tonight
a train barrels toward us its headlight bright
the train roars past away from the city
truman hurries through the train checking his ticket with the sleeper cabins
his long scarf trails behind
his longer cashmere coat practically brushes the floor
truman opens the door
inside the cabin his childhood friend from monroeville alabama nelle harper lee yes that harper lee is reading
she looks up deadpan i figured youd missed it
nelle is a year younger than truman dowdy in dress but smart tough sensible
god im glad you agreed to come
youre the only one i know with the qualifications to be both a research assistant and personal bodyguard
then noticing oh nelle you poor thing
he tries to spruce up her limp silk scarf
holds his hands im happy to see you too but i can still whip your behind
two black porters enter one with an enormous trunk trumans the other with a sensible suitcase nelles
reading tags mr
truman capote miss nelle harper lee
where would you like these sir
that one up there and that one on the floor
he tips them
what all did you bring
thank you greatly sir
its an honor to have you with us
if you dont mind my saying your last book was even better than the first youre sweet
just when you think theyve gotten as good as they can get
youre very kind
to nelle maam
the porters leave
nelle is stunned
truman fiddles with the trunk locks his back to nelle
silence then youre pathetic
truman doesnt answer
you paid them to say that
truman wont look at her
she whacks him
you paid them to say that
squealing howd you know
how did you know
just when you think theyve gotten as good as they can get
you think that was too much
laughter i thought that was a good line
more smacking of truman
then it is quiet
nelles awake but still in her bunk looking out the window at the kansas plains
trumans dressing watching her
traveling shots of harvested fields grazing livestock solitary farmhouses
the train chugs across the kansas flatlands
shots of signs outside garden city worlds largest free swimpool and howdy stranger
welcome to garden city
a friendly place
truman and nelle rent a car
nelle drives past the main square truman in the passenger seat
truman looks at a photo in the garden city telegram
alvin dewey kansas bureau of investigation
truman and nelle check in
truman and nelle trot up the courthouse steps
truman approaches the guard desk
alvin dewey please
in what used to be the sheriffs office
in the reception area alvin dewey and the two other kbi agents assigned to the clutter case are getting their jackets on and straightening their ties
theyve completely taken over the office
they are harold brother nye and roy curly church bald
they all smoke
sheriff walter sanderson s kind overweight is office less though he and his wife dorothy still live on the fourth floor of the courthouse
walter lurks in the background nowhere to go emptying one of many filled ashtrays bothered by the smoke
truman and nelle enter as the wife said no more smoking in the house
i told her fine
walters got a couch upstairs in his apartment
ill stay with him and dorothy till were done here
to walter ive got my bag and a carton of cigarettes in the car
walter looks uncomfortable
dewey shakes his head at church
truman capote from the new yorker
the agents stare at him
nye is looking at truman particularly puzzled
turns to dewey i wonder when we could arrange an interview
some time to talk
dewey stubs out his cigarette
were not looking for any inside information i dont care one way or another if you catch whoever did this im writing an article not about the clutter killings but
how theyre affecting the town how you all are bearing up i care
puts on his hat pulls out another cigarette i care a great deal if we catch whoever did this
yes as do a lot of folks around here
dewey walks out
nye and church start out after him
to church new yorker
you have press credentials
whats the new yorker
magazines dont give out you can come to the news conference with the rest of them
tips his hat to nelle sears and roebuck
nelle and truman are left alone
packed with press from all over the midwest as well as local finney county citizens
deweys leading the press conference from a folding table set up in front of the judges bench flanked by the two other kbi agents
hes got a cigarette burning in an ashtray
truman and nelle stand in the back
ill talk facts but i wont speculate
the main fact here we need to be clear on is not one but four people were killed
a lot of folks say herb clutter had to be the main target because he was dealt with the most brutally had his throat cut
a moment yes
wed all like to know why
but it couldve been any one of the family they were after
we just dont know youve identified the murder weapon
wounds indicate a shotgun close range but no casings were found
twelve gauge hunting right
they were all shot in the face
dewey looks at the journalist
then evenly no
nancy in the back of the head
is there any evidence of im sorry sexual molestation of the women
anything else stolen
kenyons radio seems to be the only
the boy was sixteen
nancy was sixteen
its her friend that found them
i assume youre okay with the laura part
k i n n e y
but please leave her be
lots of folks try to talk at once one old man makes himself heard above the rest theres talk of a bunch of mexicans a whole bunch of mexicans
standing stubs out cigarette george its good to see you again
i do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or a whole bunch as you said but it doesnt matter a whole lot whether it was
mexicans or methodists or eskimos
were going to find whoever did this
four good people from our community are dead
lets remember that
okay with you
holds up a notice the west kansas farm committees offering a thousand dollar reward for information leading to an arrest
please print that
moving to the exit thank you all for coming
the room is immediately noisy as dewey makes his way to the door pulling a pack of cigarettes from his pocket followed by church and nye
hes about to step out when truman catches his eye
nelle drives while consulting a map
truman is leaning back looking out at the passing farms through the window
he speaks almost to himself
deweys protective of the clutters
i wonder how well he knew them
nelle glances over at him
he doesnt notice
he was foxy with that old man
turns to nelle are you ever gonna let me drive
truman youre a menace
you can barely see over the wheel
truman looks back out the window at the farms leans back
this make you miss alabama
rolling window down shakes his head not even a little bit
he leans his head out closes his eyes
nelle pulls their car to the side of the county road which fronts the clutter farm
we recognize the farmhouse as the one in which nancy clutter was found dead
a highway patrolman years old sits in a cruiser parked up the driveway
crime scene tape marks the perimeter of the property
truman and nelle get out of their car stand at the foot of the driveway gazing at the lonely farmhouse
a gorgeous fall day
crowds of kids arriving at school
many are somber
as truman and nelle walk toward the kids some look warily at truman and give him a wide berth
kids back away
she leaves truman walks up to a group of three girls
can any of you tell me where id find laura kinney
the girl glances toward the school entrance where laura kinney who found nancy clutters body walks with danny burke tall
gently is that her
with the tall boy
with danny burke
girl nods thank you
as nelle leaves girl turns to her friend oh quiet yourself janice
nelle sees truman on his way toward laura calls out truman
truman truman doesnt hear
she watches truman approach them
laura backs away
danny leads her off
nelle walks over to truman looks at him for several moments
these folks live their lives in a particular way
you need to consider adapting yourself to that fact
what im gonna find out where those two kids live
maybe youll let me do that alone
on truman as the bell rings and the mass of teenagers starts to enter the school
truman walks alone sees the gilbart funeral home
he removes his hat slips past the few people standing outside
warm but slightly tacky
some people are engaged in hushed conversation at the reception area
truman slips past into the back room
no people low light
four closed caskets at the back of the room
truman walks over slowly
after a moment he checks to make sure hes alone
then he lifts the top of one of the caskets
its bonnie clutters body in a long sleaved navy blue dress but her head is wrapped in layers and layers of white cotton gauze and lacquered with a shiny substance
like an enormous cocoon
truman on the phone to jack in brooklyn
one of trumans trunks is open displaying bottles of liquor packaged and tinned gourmet food and stacks of unused yellow legal pads
he drinks standing at the window
i think i scared a friend of yours this morning
he came looking for you while i was writing
you hate my friends
i wouldnt say hate
so long as they dont knock on my door
i saw the bodies today
i looked inside the coffins
it comforts me something so horrifying its freeing
its a relief
normal life falls away
beat but then i was never much for normal life no you werent
people here wont talk to me
they want someone like you like nelle
me they hate
i cant think of a single quality i share with nelle
well maybe manliness
my point exactly
its why i left the midwest in the first place
i knew i could only find someone like you in new york city
on truman gazing at the empty town square below
a shopkeeper sweeps the sidewalk
there are thanksgiving decorations in his shop window
a school bus picks up a small boy at the intersection of a dirt road and the paved county road
a small bridge over the arkansas river
below them men are sifting the riverbed with nets moving slowly downstream
nelle waits by the front desk
the elevator doors open and truman emerges
he is dressed soberly no long scarf no long coat
he walks toward nelle then turns as if hes a runway model walks away turns again and walks back
he stops a few feet in front of her
nelle refuses to smile
danny burke walks down the road with a bookbag over his shoulder
nelle approaches him truman keeps his distance
danny stops would you mind terribly if i walked with you for a bit
they walk together
laura opens door to truman and nelle
nelle and laura kinney sit at the table
truman stands at the counter
i thought you were from the fbi with your long coat
is that so
thats why i ran off
ive been getting a lot of that lately
laura smiles back amused a bit comforted
its fine talking to you all
practically nobody around here wants to talk since what happened
folks have been through a rough patch
laura nods nancy was your best friend
she was my best friend
theyre quiet for a few moments
how has danny been
nothing terrible ever happened to him before
nancy just started wearing his ring again after this huge fight mr
clutter was trying to get her to end it cause dannys catholic
what were the clutters
danny was the last person at the house that night
thats why mr
deweys keeps interviewing him they dont think he had anything to do with it just to see if he remembers anything unusual and all
people in town seem to wonder if he was involved
thats been real hard for danny
oh its the hardest when people have a notion about you and its impossible to convince them otherwise
since i was a child folks have thought they had me pegged because of the way i look and the way i talk
theyre always wrong
looks at her do you know what i mean
laura stares at him and nods
hes clearly struck a chord
i want to show you something
she goes in the door to the ground floor apartment
they see her through the lace curtains getting something from her desk which is stacked with books
truman whispers to nelle not one person here understands her
she hugs a small book to her chest
after a moment she holds it out to them
maybe youll get a better picture of nancy
and the family
what is this
its her diary
nelle and truman walk quickly back to the hotel
nelle has the diary open
danny here tonight and we watched tv
so nice just having him sit with us
left at eleven
hes the only one i really love
she turns the page
the rest of the book is blank
and that was that
the end of a life
truman is propped up on pillows on the bed scrunching his eyes to remember what was said that afternoon then writing quickly on one of many yellow legal pads handing
the pages of interview dialogue to nelle
nelle stops typing a moment looks through the pages truman has handed her shattered
nothing terrible ever happened to him before
he pushes some pillows aside and lies down
i have percent recall of all conversations
ive tested myself
scans some of what hes written i hate that youre better than me at this
she turns back to the typewriter
truman lies there looking at the ceiling for a few moments
he closes his eyes
nelle knows without looking dont you dare close your eyes on my bed
she keeps typing
stand up and walk out that door
go to your room if youre gonna sleep
nelle turns to look at him
she goes back to typing
under her breath crap
truman drinks coffee alone sleepy
he takes a small bottle of hot pepper tabasco from his jacket pocket and shakes it over his eggs
he replaces the bottle in his jacket
nelle walks into the lobby from upstairs heads for truman
what right do you have being tired
you were snoring blissfully i dont snore while i lay there hating you you dont hate me
truman holds out a note what
takes it looks marie dewey
weve got somewhere to go for thanksgiving supper
apparently detective foxys wife has a better opinion of me than detective foxy
we see the front door open
reveal marie dewey pretty dressed primly and her two boys alvin jr
and paul lurking behind curious
reverse onto nelle
and truman dressed in a dark suit hair neatly combed like an exeter schoolboy attending a funeral
nelle nudges truman who hands over his gifts a bottle of j b and a package of gourmet spiced nuts
soberly thank you for having us
mock serious thank you
then get yourselves in here
turns and walks into the house alvin
get your pants on
on nelle and truman surprised
a football game plays on the television
no ones watching
we can hear alvin on the phone in his study at the back of the house
truman and marie at the stove
nelle sits at the kitchen table
truman has his jacket off and an apron on as does marie
they are peering into a pot of black eyed peas
marie is shaking in drops of hot pepper tabasco
alvin will hate this
yes but we who know the truth will love it
laughs i have to stop
then i cannot believe youre from new orleans
i miss it so much
i only lived there for a short while but my mama was born and bred
you know something alvin pretends he doesnt know who you are but the minute you came to town he read your books
he had one of his men pick up breakfast at tiffanys in kansas city cause its banned from the library here
what did mr
he liked it more than hes willing to admit
how very foxy
marie smiles at that word used to describe her husband
mama wouldve put in half the bottle by now
alright one more shake
alvin walks toward the kitchen
he looks exhausted
he hears squeals of laughter
they all stop laughing and look at him
nods to truman and nelle
marie sips her drink
how you doing foxy
she cracks up
the remains of dinner
the kids have left
the bottle of j b sits on the table half empty
maries a bit drunk
everyones plate is clean except for alvins on which sits a mound of uneaten black eyed peas
truman is mid story
i was writing the script as they were filming all that time in italy
id work like mad all day long and then dash down to the bar around midnight to hand in the next days scenes
humphrey had just about moved into the hotel bar whispers to alvin humphrey bogart
where he and john drank every night to alvin john huston
and i mean drank like famished water buffaloes
well id only just handed them the final scene when the bellhop told me i had a phone call
it was my stepfather joe capote calling to say that my mother had died
i flew home to new york terribly distraught but when i got to the apartment i could see that joe was in even worse shape than i was
he grabbed my hands and sat me down at the kitchen table and he said to me talk
talk about anything any subject in the world
dont worry whether it will interest me or not
just talk so i wont break down
and i did
he couldnt bear to be alone with his thoughts
it was too painful
its quiet for a moment then marie looks at alvin
its been a hard couple weeks for alvin
he and herb clutter were good friends
marie oh come on alvin
these are good people
finally dewey looks at truman and nelle
alvin shows truman and nelle the crime scene photos from the clutter murders
we see the four corpses bound and shot the bloody footprints in the clutter basement
truman and nelle stare at the photos of nancy and kenyon
then quietly who would put a pillow under the boys head just to shoot him
why would they tuck nancy in
surprised by the insight i want to know the same thing
truman hands nelle one of the photos
she looks at it twisted notion of tenderness
truman and nelle are leaving
alvin and marie stand in the front door
nelle kisses marie
so many of my friends would love to meet you
thatd be fine to dewey you dont have to worry
im not going to write about this until everythings over
im not worried
i know what room youre in at the hotel
and i know where you live in brooklyn
music have yourself a merry little christmas
main street christmas lights in the trees
the hardware store with santa claus decorations in the window and a one week left to buy your gifts
truman and nelle walk with pete holt very frail on the clutter property
apples rot on the ground the trees are bare signs of disrepair are beginning to weather the house
re the apples id of picked them up but i havent been myself
mind you i make the walk out here every day check the house make sure the pipes dont freeze that sort of item
the least i can do for mr
how long have you worked here
a lotta years
the wife too cleaning the house
well shes marvelous
lunch was wonderful
ignoring this she had a hard job after what all happened
i burned most of the rest mattresses too far of a mess
then looks at them ive asked around some if anyones looking for a strong hand
they dont know what to say
finally he looks away
i dont think theyll be able to sell the place till they catch the ones that did it
beat thats what i hear anyhow
silence as the three of them look out over the barren fields
just the bed frame the mattress is gone
truman and nelle find her bible on the bedside table her bookmark see the painting of jesus walking on water
pete holt stands off to the side waiting patiently
through the front window we see a christmas tree in the lobby
jazzy christmas music on the radio
nelle sits in the big armchair with a drink
we hear jack on the phone youre celebrating
we see truman wearing a yellow silk short robe with white lace bare legs
hes on the phone and walking for nelles enjoyment back and forth like a runway model
remember nelles manuscript she sent me in new york
killing a mockingbird
you said it was good
and i was right
she just heard lipincott wants to publish it
tell her congratulations
covers phone mouths to nelle jealous
just promise youll be home by christmas
i cant leave now jack i mean it was hard at first but now im practically the mayor

jack well go away this spring to write
hangs up the poor boy misses me
goes to the mini bar to fix a drink
you remember when we were kids
i was never a kid
i was born fully formed
i had no idea what a homosexual was
but i knew whatever they were you were one of em
truman puts down his drink and marches out of the room shuts the door
nelles unsure whether she really insulted him
from the hall we hear a woman shriek and a man saying oh
truman runs back in shuts door
they crack up
tasteful christmas lights strung on the bushes
a wreath on the front door
truman nelle marie and alvin
a full ashtray on the coffee table in front of alvin
hes distracted smoking
marie holds a womens magazine checking what truman says with whats written there
quickly as if reciting girdle up no extra bulges if youre dressed right for him when he gets home the evening should be smooth sailing
bon voyage gals
i cant believe you got this whole page i only read it to you once
ive trained myself
truman looks at nelle
i have percent recall
laughing you cut that out
alvin stubs out his cigarette though it still burns
you believe that alvin
he walks out
stubs out cigarette smoking three packs a day
then two men did it
they know who
one of them used to have a cellmate who gave him up for the thousand dollar reward
they passed through kansas city last week writing bad checks by the time alvins boys got up there theyd skipped out again
they have no idea
truman nelle marie and alvin have just sat down
they wait for the dewey boys alvin jr
we hear them in the living room horsing around
its quiet for a second
then something crashes and breaks
gets up goes come here
get over here
dad the phone
back to the table
dewey returns to the dining room pushing paul ahead of him
tell them were at dinner alvin
not now alvin
we hear the phone being hung up
returns and sits
they all get ready to say grace then you need to call the chief of police in las vegas when you have a minute
everyone looks at dewey
over black screen we hear the voice of a radio announcer
this is kerg radio garden city
a friendly broadcast from a friendly place
our lead story slowly the sounds of a crowd emerge in the background
fade up on high school kids sitting on the hood and front seat of a chew parked at the edge of a crowd of people
it is cold
a fat shivering co ed reads the headline in the kansas city star police fear lynch mob
the car radio is on
newsmen from six states have joined scores of kansans as they await the arrival of confessed killers perry smith and richard hickock
kbi officers have been driving the clutter familys brutal killers nonstop from
truman moves from the car into the large crowd
old ladies ranchers local businessmen moms with kids journalists interviewing citizens photographers lined up at the bottom of the courthouse steps
we hear snippets of conversation as we pass
a citizen is being interviewed by a journalist a mom with baby standing with a friend a middle aged man in an overcoat crying silently
truman approaches nelle and marie dewey standing together at the curb in front of the courthouse near the photographers
they are talking quietly turn to truman hey
we hear loud crowd noise at the south end of the square
a convoy of four cars enters the square
it pulls around to the front of the courthouse
state troopers spill out of the lead and rear cars
nye gets out of the second car
he opens the back door
the crowd falls silent
two state troopers get dick hickock handcuffed pale out of the car and lead him up the steps
dewey and church open the third cars back door
they retrieve perry smith
perry is extremely short strong oddly beautiful with the dark skin and hair of his american indian mother and the pug features of his irish father
as he stands he has trouble straightening his stubby legs as if they are arthritic
whispers to truman motorcycle accident
he broke them and they never healed right
truman looks at her alvin told me
truman watches perry transfixed
perry seems terrified of the crowd all the faces like a child
perry scans the crowd
his eyes fall on truman
truman and perry look at each other as perry is led slowly past
at the top of the steps the courthouse doors slam shut
fade in truman knocks on the door a newspaper a book and a paper bag in his hand
on the door it says sheriffs residence private
dorothy sanderson opens the door
i figured youd be left alone this morning by that hard working husband of yours
holds up bag so i have breakfast
holds up paper i have news

my friend jack mailed me the book you wanted
he presents book
dorothy flattered takes it reads the inscription inside
for the maiden of the midwest the priestess of the plains the queen of the kitchen my first novel
it is other voices other rooms and we see on the back of it the infamous jacket photo of truman at draped sexily on a couch
the phone rings
youre too much
go on into the living room lemme grab that its been ringing all morning
truman walks into the residence
to the left is the kitchen to the right is the living room
truman looks back at dorothy shes still on the phone
he heads for the kitchen
truman walks slowly through the doorway of the large kitchen
on the far side of the kitchen is a jail cell
inside the cell is perry smith
now we know why truman came here
perry doesnt see him hes resting his head on a small table the tip of his thumb in his mouth
the chair seems too tall for perry
he looks like a lonely kindergartner told to take his afternoon nap
after several moments dorothy enters flustered oh
i meant in there
points to living room i
perry sits up quickly rubs his legs
its the womens cell
its hardly ever used
but they wanted to um separate
lets sit in the living room
ill set up in the living room
she gathers a tray of trumans pastries and coffee cups
she goes truman starts to follow then lingers
they put you in the womens cell
among other indignities
perrys voice is oddly high whispery special words are precisely enunciated
shes a good cook
shes scared of me
i think so am i
a little bit
a moment then you have any aspirin
my legs dorothys in the doorway
truman looks at dorothy looks back at perry
judge roland tate white haired imperious bangs his gavel
the packed crowd quiets down
perry and dick sit at the defense table chewing juicy fruit gum
next to them their aged court appointed lawyer franklin weeks
dick wears a shirt and tie
perry wears jeans rolled up at the cuff his shirt open at the collar
he draws on a piece of paper with a stubby pencil a rather good picture of a large parrot
truman sits with nelle watching perry murmurs his feet dont touch the floor
in the matter of the state of kansas v
richard eugene hickock and perry edward smith this court has been informed by counsel mr
weeks that defendants wish to waive their right to preliminary hearing
hickock is that your wish
hickock looks at weeks
truman whispers to nelle why are they doing that
then i ask that the waiver be effectuated
judge tate looks at him for a moment so noted
bangs gavel were adjourned
crowd gets up
truman watches perry and dick through the forest of bodies
they are led away in handcuffs
franklin weeks stands slowly then begins gathering his things hes old and it takes him ages to collect his papers
he holds a pie
offers pie madame sanderson
is that for the two of us to share
or for me to eat alone while you talk to our guest
truman is caught
truman sits near the bars of the cell
perry draws on a scrap of paper at the small table
dorothy watches from the door to the living room
the book truman gave to dorothy lies on the floor next to perrys meticulously made bed
was it your choice to waive the hearing
perry doesnt answer
dorothy checks her watch leaves
truman takes a bottle of bayer aspirin out of his pocket
you still need some
perry doesnt move give me your hand
perry extends his hand through the bars
as truman shakes some aspirin into it i could kill you if you got too close
perry puts the aspirin in his mouth chews them holds out his hand for more
truman gives him more which perry puts in his pocket for later
would you like some water
perry shakes his head
sanderson lent you my book he said wed curry favor with the judge if we waived our rights
truman nods not wanting to push this any further
perry picks up the book holds it out through the bars
your pictures undignified
people recall first impressions
whats been your first impression

dorothy pokes her head in from the living room
walters gonna be home soon
to perry i just want permission to talk
then has anyone else visited
perry doesnt answer
truman will you tell me if you need anything
i can have whatever you want sent from new york
no answer will you do that
on perry considering whether to trust this man
phone rings william shawn answers new yorker editor conservatively attired at a desk looking onto th street
intercut to truman in a phone booth outside the courthouse

how quickly can you get dick avedon out here to take some pictures
intercut to william shawns office
on shawn he doesnt know how to begin to respond
perry has been placed in an adjoining cell for the afternoon
he combs his greased hair in a mirror
a camera flashes
nelle and truman sit outside the cells
franklin weeks dozes off to the side
richard avedon small dark wiry flamboyant is snapping photos of a bare chested hickock in the next cell particularly his tattoos while hickock chatters away
you look terrific
perry is embarrassed glances over at truman
calm yourself down sweetheart
perry glances at nelle
she motions to him that his shirt is buttoned wrong
perry fixes it looks back at her
hickock notices truman gazing at his tattoos the one on his chest the word peace with a cross radiating rays of light
be patient capote
maybe later theyll send you my skin
i have the perfect place for it over the hearth
truman looks over at perry sitting alone
truman starts to remove his tie
photos in quick succession of hickock pulling up his sleeve to reveal his tattoos
of perry combing his hair
the grinning cat on hickocks hand
perry looking directly at the camera
series of shots in and around the courthouse title up one month later an officer approaches down a long hallway
a janitor cleans the basin of the water fountain
spectators are drawn into the courthouse
the officer opens the courtroom doors
a crescendo of sounds
spectators take seats
the jury files back into the box
perry and dick chew gum
perry wears trumans tie and draws on a pad with a new set of colored pencils another parrot quite beautiful now yellow
nelle and truman sit together
whered perry get the art set
nelle raises her eyebrows
judge tate gavels loudly looks to the jury
members of the jury

judge tate turns back to the foreman

perry and dick are set upon by sheriffs deputies and led out
photographers crowd them
dick turns to perry
least now were not the only killers in kansas
perry looks at him utterly lost
nelle sits at the window smoking
truman in the armchair holding a drink
theyve been up all night
their bags are packed
also a few packed boxes of written in yellow notepads and many typed pages
truman glances at his watch
you think he slept at all
nelle looks over at him
i need to see him before we go
truman sits next to perrys cell
perry lies on the bed staring at the ceiling
theyre going to transfer you up to lansing today
youll have to make sure to put me on the visitors list
otherwise i cant see you
will you do that
im going to help find you a proper lawyer
you need a serious lawyer for an appeal
no response they took dick last night
i need you to get him to do the same thing put me on the visitors list
will you do that perry
perry closes his eyes
fade up on the sounds of a huge party in progress
we see a home made banner reading return to civilization
the camera follows nelle as she walks through the crowd gays straights smoke and noise
society women slender and beautiful ben baron pontificating to christopher isherwood
kudos on kill the bird
is that it
william shawn talks to a much taller woman
he hasnt written a word yet though he says its the nonfiction book of the decade
we hear truman before we see him hes little but terrifying we see truman in the corner entertaining a small group
jack dunphy stands off to the side
nelle settles next to jack
hes as short as i am
and almost as pretty
id be with him right now but hes being given new accommodations guests laugh
most people assume hes a monster
i dont see him that way
the book im writing will return him to the realm of humanity its the book i was always meant to write
nelle and jack stand back watching
this is the start of a great love affair
truman in love with truman
truman is being interviewed over lunch
i was in marilyns apartment just last week
i had to break it to her that of the four matisses hanging on her wall two were upside down
the reporter laughs
a waiter passes
truman taps his glass
to reporter to answer your question im following breakfast at tiffanys by blazing a different path by inventing an entirely new kind of writing the non fiction novel
you have a subject
truman takes a last sip of his drink utterly serious now
on the night of november two men broke into a quite farmhouse in kansas and murdered an entire family
why did they do that
its been suggested that this subject is tawdry its not worthy of literature
two worlds exist in this country the quiet conservative life and the life of those two men the underbelly the criminally violent
those worlds converged that bloody night
i spent the past three months interviewing everyone in kansas touched by that violence
i spent hours talking to the killers and ill spend more
waiter brings his drink researching this work has changed my life altered my point of view about almost everything
i think those who read it will be similarly affected
he sips such a book can only be written by a journalist who has mastered the techniques of fiction youre speaking of yourself
youre really very clever
truman sits in bed writing on a yellow legal pad surrounded by piles of notes
he squints his eyes concentrating
jack enters delivers a cup of coffee
truman doesnt notice
truman is rifling through the boxes looking for particular notes
he cant find what he needs
the phone rings
jack and truman walk
perrys decided to appeal
he claims their attorney was incompetent that he never raised the issue of temporary insanity
so you find them a new lawyer
theyre facing execution in six weeks jack
they need someone to argue whether or not thats right
id also like to see them alive yes thank you very much
i need to hear their story
they walk in silence for a few moments
if you met him youd understand
its as if no ones ever asked him a single question about himself
damaged and strange unexplored
then i dont trust this hickock fellow
perrys the only person who can describe to me what happened that night
i need to hear him say it
just be careful what you do to get what you want
im finding them a lawyer
youre finding yourself a lawyer
truman drives alone concentrating intently
he has to stretch to see over the dashboard
a turreted civil war era fortress an hours drive from kansas city
truman pulls up to the guardhouse
truman waits alone looking at the lone decoration a campaign poster showing a fat man in a suit grinning while holding a shotgun
across the bottom it reads walk tall with krutch
a young prison guard sticks his head out of the office door
warden krutch will see you now
wood paneled walls government issue desk
on the wall behind the desk is a chart a racial accounting of the current inmate population
it reads white colored warden marshall krutch is fat coarse sweaty even in winter
and its spring
hes running for congress there are krutch for congress bumper stickers laying around the office
hes enjoying a chance at a little publicity
the young prison guard stands quietly by the wall
we do well by our boys
showers once a week
feed em good
well be feeding perry smith in the infirmary soon if he dont eat
get the food in through his arm
what are you talking about
hasnt eaten in a month
but its not his right to kill himself
its the peoples right
the people of this state
and thats who i work for the people
you can write any of this down
no one told me
when can i see him
checking desk calendar how about you come back thursday
thats no good
i need to see them now then whenever i want for as long as i want
not how we do things here
truman glances at the campaign stickers the young prison guard then back at krutch
i understand what a burden unlimited visitation might be on this institution and on the people who pay for it
i want to be clear that i dont expect the citizens of leavenworth county to have to shoulder that burden
truman reaches into his jacket pulls from it an envelope stuffed with cash
he lays it on the desk
to be dispensed as you see fit
krutch is stone faced as he regards the money
finally i didnt know where to count your boy being half indian
i did him a favor though
points to race chart counted him white
youre a kind and generous man
the second floor of a small building in the corner of the prison complex
the one hall is lit by mesh covered bare bulbs in the ceiling
twelve cells six on each side
each is by feet with one small high window covered by bars and wire
the young prison guard opens the heavy gate at the end of the hall and shows truman in
they walk down the row of cells
in one of them we notice lowell lee andrews white spectacled enormously fat peering at his own face inches from a mirror
dick is leaning against the bars of his own cell
thanks for your help with the lawyer
you must be desperate for a story to come all the way out here
youre entitled to go in
you may um go in
if you wish
truman hesitates for a second
you want to see perry
truman walks to the next cell
ask me hes just trying to prove the insanity defense
truman sees perry gaunt lying on his cot almost comatose
perrys rather striking drawing of a large yellow parrot sits propped on his table
an uneaten lunch tray lies on the floor a cockroach runs over it
truman watches disturbed
camera follows truman as he walks down an aisle with a small wicker basket
he stops looks at a shelf
truman waits in the check out line behind a mom paying for her groceries
her son stands next to her legs wearing a little cowboy hat and cradling a toy gun to his chest
he sucks his thumb
truman and the boy look at each other
truman sits on the chair his wicker basket on the table
he has spread out a cloth napkin
a guard watches from outside the cell
perry lies completely still on the cot
truman takes out jars of bonnet baby food inspects the labels
to perry i dont care what your plans are for yourself
he decides on the custard jar
he opens it takes a plastic baby spoon from the basket
but youre gonna wake up enough to tell me what you did with my tie
he spoons a bit into perrys mouth
the guard walks away
truman leans close to perry whispers its okay
its your friend
truman stands against the wall watching him
he has cleaned up the basket of food
he walks over to perrys desk sees two handwritten notebooks on it the private diary of perry edward smith and personal dictionary
next to them he sees a pencil self portrait perry drew
its very good
truman touches it
truman sits on the chair watching waiting
perry opens his eyes looks at truman
perry is sitting up a bit truman helps him sip a cup of water
perry lies back down
hes looking at truman
howd you learn to draw like that
perry closes his eyes
truman drives through the kansas state penitentiary gate waves to the guard
perry sits on the bed cleaned up wet hair neatly combed looking at a few old snapshots he has saved in a handkerchief
truman sits in the chair across from him
perry hands him a photo of his mother
perry speaks quietly
before she had us
before she started drinking
who took care of you as a child
me and linda
thats your sister
truman waits for more
it doesnt come
were not so different as you might think
i was abandoned repeatedly as a child
my mamad drag me along to some new town so she could take up with another man shed met
night after night shed lock me in the hotel room mamad turn the latch and tell the staff not to let me out no matter what
i was terrified id scream my head off till finally id collapse on the carpet next to the door and fall asleep
after years of this she just left me with relatives in alabama
who raised you up
perry nods thats when i met nelle she lived next door
looks again at the photo hands it back your mother was indian
drinking was not a good thing for her
no tolerance for it
and your father
no tolerance for him either
trumans laughs surprised by the joke though its unclear whether perry meant it as one
he stares at perry
what i cant decide is if you understand how fascinating you are
perry doesnt respond then im sorry about your tie
they took it away from me because were all on suicide watch
its why the lights stay on at night
i hope were past that now
you had me worried
i dont care about the tie
its just a pity because it looked so good on you
perry leans in motions toward dicks cell lowers his voice be careful of ricardo
i think he wants you all to himself
alright but hes naturally mendacious not to be trusted if he had a hundred dollars hed steal a stick of chewing gum
perry shakes his head
then truman nods toward perrys notebooks
i want to take your notebooks with me i want to read them
if i leave here without understanding you the world will always see you as a monster
i dont want that i dont see you that way
a moment then perry reaches for the notebooks hands them to truman
then he hands truman the drawing he did of himself
i tracked my father down in alaska
one day i said to him moms dead
i could see it
a week later we got the news
she finally drunk herself to death
truman regards perry
then he looks at the drawing this is remarkable
sometimes you see a thing how it really is
on truman holding the drawing looking at perry
truman walks quickly to his car holding perrys drawing and notebooks
at the car he looks back at the dark jailhouse
truman at the desk perrys two books next to a legal pad already filled with notes
hes on the phone with nelle paging through the personal dictionary captivated by it
he trusts me thats why he gave it to me
hes given me absolutely everything
paging through diary you should see his drawings nelle how good he is
he wants so badly to be taken seriously to be held in some esteem
intercut with nelle in pajamas sitting on the porch of her home in monroeville smoking
do i what
hold him in esteem
hes a gold mine
i mean hes told me his entire life and now its all here for me to write down all of the history i need
his entire life in this diary
his dead mother
a brother and sister killed themselves
you tell him your mama did the same thing
i tell him everything
weve been talking our heads off the past month
sometimes when i think how good my book can be i can hardly breathe
finds what he wants heres what i wanted to read to you if called upon to make a speech this is exactly what i was talking about a speech just
in case hes ever recognized for an achievement if called upon to make a speech i cant remember what i was going to say for the life of me
i dont think ever before have so many people been so directly responsible for my being so very very glad
its a wonderful moment and a rare one
beat theres an exclamation point on the end of that thank you in case you didnt catch it
silence whered you go
we hear nelle exhale her cigarette
i guess it stopped being funny
i never said it was
turns a page listen to this
truman is eating breakfast with alvin dewey
a waitress refills their coffees
to waitress thanks
an uncomfortable silence
then youre nothing if not hard working
you look good healthy again
not a chance
dewey taps a cigarette out of his pack
ive decided on a title for my book
i think youll like it very masculine
in cold blood
lights the cigarette that refers to the crime or the fact that youre still talking to the criminals
the former among other things
they eat for a moment
then ive been wanting to ask if youll let me look at your investigation notes
that lawyer you helped find for your friends got them a hearing at the kansas supreme court i heard this morning
on the issue of inadequate counsel
do you not want me to look at your notes
you are permitted to say no
rises takes out wallet ill tell you what if those boys get off im coming to brooklyn to hunt you down
truman cant decide whether dewey is kidding or not
dewey puts money on the table
i have to be in court at nine oclock
he walks away
over his shoulder call roy church
hell show you what you want to see
truman walks down the hall
he passes dicks cell
dick is lying in bed
dick rises and smiles widely at truman
truman smiles puts his fingers to his lips continues past
he stops outside perrys cell
perry looking much healthier is drawing at his table a picture of the huge yellow parrot swooping down from the sky
truman watches for a few moments then perry looks at him
the guard locks truman inside with perry
truman looks at the guard he leaves
it was as much for me as for anyone
i couldnt bear the thought of losing you so soon
were going to be able to use your book for our case
youll write we never got to raise our insanity plea
you wrote how terrible the lawyer was
i havent written a word yet
what have you been doing
waiting to talk to you
i had hoped what are you calling it
looks directly at him i have no idea
if im going to write about you if im going to determine how to write about you you need to tell me about that night at the clutter house
perry just looks at him
perry shakes his head
do you worry what ill think
perry looks away
a long moment
is that it
then dick says you know elizabeth taylor
i know a lot of people
truman gives up for now
sees the picture of the yellow bird on the desk
what is that you keep drawing
you must hate having to come to this place perry i have invitations to be in morocco greece
i choose to be here
those people have everything all their prayers have been answered yet theyre more desperate than ever
i prefer to be here with you
looks at truman evenly i was ten i wet the bed the nuns at the orphanage hated the smell
first month one of them found me shivering just trying to get through the night
the sister pulled back the covers and shined her flashlight to see what id did
the sheets were wet
she hit me so many times with that flashlight she broke it
he shrugs that night i dreamed about the yellow bird
yellow like the sun
it picked me up and it clawed the nuns eyes and it lifted me into the sky
they look at each other
truman on the street outside the club at a pay phone
he talks with jack in brooklyn
im just missing this one piece jack
be patient with me
how long is that gonna take
why dont you try leaving him alone for a while
come to spain
you can always visit him later
i dont know
well im off
ive got my own writing to do
do it in brooklyn
wait for me
too many people around
beat ill leave the address on the kitchen table
truman what do you do there when youre not with him
it must be awful
trumans watching a young guy standing outside the bar looking at him
think about what i said
join me when you can
truman follows the young guy into the bar
he opens his eyes in bed
turns to the bedside table to see the drawing of perry looking at him
a young drifter stands alone on an empty street corner
he checks a pay phone for a coin
perry is lying on his cot reading an adventure magazine something to do with finding buried treasure off the coast of mexico and sucking on the tip of his thumb
after a moment he startles and looks up
truman stands outside his cell
he holds a stack of books perrys personal dictionary and diary and a new websters dictionary and thesaurus
i didnt see you
stands tucks in shirt come in
wheres the guard
i brought you some things but i have to fly back east
who are you going there to see from next cell capote get it straight in your book we never intended on killing that family i told him that
no premeditation i told him
perry searches the cell for something else to give to truman to keep him there
then he stops
he has nothing left to give and is unwilling to talk about that night at the clutters
he becomes very still
truman speaks gently your writings are magnificent
i hope these help you do more
truman places the books on the floor just outside perrys cell perrys writings in one stack and the new dictionaries in another right next to it
i have so much material from the trial from our visits your journals
i have to organize it all and i have to start the process of writing
no response ill visit soon
perhaps this fall
backing away i miss you already
write me every five minutes
he turns and goes
we stay with perry as truman leaves
we hear dick speak to truman
be good now
hear trumans footsteps receding
then a long shot of the hallway as the guard lets truman out the gate at the end of the row
perry looks down at the books sitting on the floor outside his cell
he crouches puts his hand through the bars and touches the cover of the new dictionary
over black the sound of a jet airplane loud then passing
fade in bright white sky
sounds of seagulls
ocean sand cottage houses in greenery set back from the beach
the house jack rented
jack types on the upstairs deck
truman pulls up in an old taxi
jack looks out over the railing to the street
jack emerges on the front porch as truman walks up the path with his bags
they look at each other
then truman looks around at the incredible garden the ocean in the background and starts to laugh
title up january sound of a manual typewriter over black
fade in on the peaceful outside of the house
sound of typing
a phone rings
camera tracks slowly through the pretty tiled living room toward a door at the far end
truman at his desk surrounded by piles of filled yellow pads note cards an open trunk of random notes
he is at the manual typewriter
the phone is on the floor ringing
the phone rings
exasperated he picks up
i was supposed to be home for dinner with my wife three hours ago i have not been able to tear myself away from your book
its that good
its not good its astonishing
this first half is astonishing
if the second half lives up to this it it how much is left to do
intercut with shawns office at the new yorker night
shawn has a stack of manuscript pages on his desk
im already well into the third part but i i cant finish that till i convince perry to describe the night of the killings to me
i was planning to visit this fall see i think you need to talk to him now
and we all need to see how this ends for the final part
i cant finish the book till i know what happens
if perry and dick are executed its one thing and if not well truman
you got your ending i really dont know the kansas court denied their appeal
it came over the wire on friday
you need to talk to perry now
hell be dead by september
im sorry i know how much youve come to care about him
truman is completely immobile
i want to set up a reading for you in the fall in new york
well build some interest and well publish in the fall
truman at the stove watching his tea water heat up
jack enters with a huge basket of wine and groceries
we have nothing in the house
he takes one from the basket
jack starts to unpack food
why arent you working
i knew you couldnt be depended on to stock the kitchen
truman looks at him blankly
what would we feed our famous guest
i completely forgot
he helps jack put away the groceries
then utterly nonchalant plus i finished my novel yesterday
truman looks at jack smiles widely
truman jack and nelle
a bonfire a wind up victrola playing ella fitzgerald bottles of wine
jack and nelle dance
truman toasts jack drunkenly
my man my hero my talented
you said that
you are the hardest worker the most unsung talent i know
as nelle passes by on her way to london to sell her book which needs no selling may a little of her success rub off on both of us
nelle tries to smack truman but cant catch him
the song changes to a slow one
jack and truman dance sweetly together
nelle sits on the sand and watches
truman and nelle are sitting nelle has a small envelope in her hand
truman is obviously uncomfortable
as jack delivers a platter of omelettes to the table to truman when was the last time you wrote back to him
i dont know
a letter for your boyfriend i was asked to deliver
lets have it
nelle opens the letter reads dear friend truman
where are you
read this item in a medical dictionary death by hanging is caused by asphyxia by fracture of the cervical vertebrae by laceration of the trachea
not too comforting as we lost our appeal
missing you alone and desirous of your presence
your amigo perry
shawn told me about the court decision yesterday
i was wondering why you were in such a good mood
surely i thought its not because i finished my little book
thats a terrible thing to say
jack looks out at the ocean
to no one in particular i used to write him all the time
ive been so focused lately on the book
truman and nelle carry her bags down the front walk toward a waiting taxi
jack says im using perry but he also thinks i fell in love with him when i was in kansas
how both of those things can be true is beyond me
fall in love with him
silence as they load the bags into the trunk
i dont know how to answer that
its as if perry and i started life in the same house
one day he stood up and walked out the back door while i walked out the front
with some different choices hes the man i might have become
are you kidding me
truman shrugs doesnt answer
nelle kisses him
be nice to jack
sometimes i think hes what i like about you best
smiles ill see you at the reading in new york
nelle gets in the taxi then leans her head out the window
are you going back to kansas because you care about perry or because you need information before hes killed
cant it be both
i dont think it can be
she drives away
truman watches her go
he turns back up toward the house stops a moment to pick a flower from the bushes at the front gate
a guard walks down the corridor carrying a single flower
he delivers it to perry then walks off
perry is confused
he hears footsteps approaching but cant see who it is
camera on perry as the footsteps finally arrive outside his cell
reverse onto truman looking tanned healthy very blond
he holds a stack of books with a bow on top
long shot of dimly lit corridor light spilling out from each cell
a row guard walks the hall
we hear voices murmuring
six more guards arrive at the top of the stairs
the row guard walks over unlocks the gate to let them in
perry is looking at the cover of a book walden pond
other books sit next to perry on the cot
among them willa cathers my antonia also great expectations what was he in jail for
they said it was not paying his taxes
but really for being an outsider refusing to go along
perry nods looks at the other books
you dont have to read any of these if you dont want to
but i thought youd like something decent
youre much too smart for adventure magazines
through the bars of perrys cell we can see the six guards enter lowell lee andrews cell diagonally across the corridor
the row guard appears at perrys cell
lock down while lowell goes to solitary
nobody in or out
to truman you want in or out
truman looks at perry then back to the guard
the six guards start to pack up andrews cell while he sits on the cot and watches
perry and truman talk very quietly
throughout this scene we see in the background across the corridor the mostly obscured cell of andrews
we see his incredibly fat leg being shackled his belongings being packed in boxes
everyone says hes a genius
i dont think hes a genius
hes rich and he went to college like any of us wouldve if we got the chance
he came home for christmas and shot his parents in front of the television
you remember the story they were watching father knows best
they look at each other and smile
then i wont be sorry to see him go
always correcting my grammar
they watch andrews being shackled in the background
now dick and me were next in line
truman regards perry who looks down
im so sorry ive been away
it was a long time
i wish you could come next week when they take him out to the corner but the whole prison shuts down
i have to be in new york anyway
hows the book going
will you show it to me
ive hardly written anything
one of the six guards clangs andrews cell bars with his stick
the row guard opens the cell door
andrews is led out arms and legs shackled into the corridor
keep your head high buddy
or they wont be able to rope you under your fat fucking chin
andrews is led past perrys cell
he looks in at perry
andrews shuffles down the hall
perry watches him go
on truman watching perry
we hear the gate slam shut
nelle stands with william shawn who receives well wishers
ben baron enters seeing nelle
loudly over the hubbub hello hollywood
thats quite a bundle you sold your book for
nelle is embarrassed mostly for baron to have the issue of money brought up publicly
baron moves past nelle smiles politely whispers to shawn
what a gentleman
truman sits alone
in the background we can hear the noise of the huge crowd gathering in the theater
truman wears his most stylish literary outfit a gorgeous dark green knize suit over a black cashmere turtleneck sweater and horn rimmed glasses which weve never seen him wear before
hes frozen with anticipation nervousness
after several moments a theater assistant opens the door
can i get you anything
clears his throat thank you
the assistant leaves
we hear the crowd quiet down
truman rises slowly walks through the door to the backstage area
we hear william shawn on stage
welcome new yorkers
shawn pauses briefly for a laugh that doesnt come
truman continues walking toward the backstage curtains
thank you for coming to the first public reading the first offering of any kind of truman capotes new work in cold blood
our magazine truman walks on stage
shawn sees him slinks back to his seat
truman walks over to the podium takes in the enormous crowd
once it is completely quiet hello
my name is truman capote
people laugh and applaud loudly
perry eating dinner alone at his table looks up
we hear a loud engine revving outside
a front loader tractor drives into the warehouse
a prison police car parks outside the warehouse
guards get the enormous lowell lee andrews shackled from the back seat walk him inside
c u on perry now standing on his chair and watching out the tiny window
truman on stage reading
perry smiths voice was both gentle and prim a voice that though soft manufactured each sound exactly ejected it like a smoke ring issuing from a parsons mouth
perry watches through his window
from inside the warehouse we hear the gallows trap door spring and clatter
on perry truman reading
utter silence except for his voice
the village of holcomb stands on the high wheat plains of western kansas a lonesome area that other kansans call out there
until one morning in mid november few americans in fact few kansans had ever heard of holcomb
like the waters of the arkansas river like the motorists on the highway
exceptional happenings had never stopped there
we see the outside wall with perry and dicks faces peering out through their tiny windows
the tractor emerges through the warehouse doors
it carries in its front shovel the enormous dead body of andrews covered by a black cloth
the audience completely still
the four coffins which quite filled the small flower crowded parlor were to be sealed at the funeral services very understandably for the effect
nancy wore her dress of cherry red velvet her brother a bright plaid shirt the parents were more sedately attired mr
clutter in navy blue flannel his wife in navy blue crepe and and it was this especially that lent the scene an awful aura the head of each was completely
encased in cotton a swollen cocoon twice the size of an ordinary blown up balloon and the cotton because it had been sprayed with a glossy substance twinkled like christmas tree snow
the tractor rolls the body into the bed of a waiting pick up perry watches through his window
the audience transfixed
imagination of course can open any door turn the key and let terror walk right in
one tuesday at dawn a carload of
strangers ignorant of the local disaster were startled by what they saw as they crossed the prairies and passed through holcomb windows ablaze almost every window in almost every house
and in the brightly lit rooms fully clothed people even entire families who had sat the whole night wide awake watchful listening
of what were they frightened
it might happen again
he closes his manuscript
several moments of silence then thunderous applause
trumans dressing room
packed with well wishers drinking from bottles of champagne smoking toasting shouting to be heard
truman in the corner with christopher isherwood ben baron others laughing
a literary enthusiast approaches leans in
your portrait of those men was terrifying
truman and isherwood watch him walk away
your hairpiece is terrifying
i was going to say the same thing
truman laughs loudly
we see nelle look over from across the room at her friend having the time of his life
truman is hung over but immensely gratified
hes with shawn
everyone was there
tennessee loved it
of course he did
should we do more
i was terrified but no now we get to withhold while everyone else talks
let them do the work
truman is barely able to suppress his excitement
this book is going to change everything
itll change how people see you as a writer
itll change how people write
youll finish by october
i think so
you know theyre scheduled for next month
ill commit as many issues as it takes to publish
as many as it takes
im flying to kansas tomorrow
ill get perry to talk honestly whats he got to lose
truman smiles at the joke then stops himself
it really is too awful
youll be able to finish now
as strange as it may sound to you im going to miss him
over black the sound of a jet airplane loud then passing
truman flushed out of breath stands outside perrys cell
hes just arrived
he holds a folded up newspaper
perry sits at his table reading legal documents
when did you hear
perry looks up mistaking trumans state for shared enthusiasm
he smiles widely
two days ago
the guard opens the cell for truman
perry holds up one of the documents
its what weve been waiting for
a stay of execution to make a federal appeal
perry goes to him and hugs him tightly
all thanks to you
on truman shocked being hugged
truman sits on the bed his coat still on watching perry hyped up talking walking around the cell
kansass had it in for me for ten years in prison the first time at that trial here
they cant corner me now
not till the u
government says so perry sit down
for a minute
perry sits i need you to talk to me
weve got all the time in the world to talk
ive been thinking about ricardo
you need to stop sending him those trashy books
i wont even mention the pornography
getting up i realize he might have trouble grasping the literature you gave me but those books only exacerbate the problem only heighten or intensify it
maybe we should start him on a program
give him the simple novels first perry
i know what exacerbate means
i thought in case
there is not a word or a sentence or a concept that you can illuminate for me
there is one singular reason that i keep coming here truman november th
three years ago
thats all i want to hear from you
ive asked you not to stands up this is ridiculous
to the guard im ready
to perry i have a plane to catch
i found your sister in tacoma
maybe shell talk to me about something useful
dont go out there
the guard lets truman out of the cell
please dont go out there
the guard shuts the door
this is my work perry
when you want to tell me what i need to hear you let me know
he walks off down the hall
the gate slams shut
cheaply built ranch house
linda murchak walks in the kitchen back door shuts it
theyll play outside a while longer
murchak looks like a female perry dark and small attractive and nervous
through the window we see three little children playing on a decrepit jungle gym in the yard
truman sits at the table leafing through a photo album
i dont want them to see that
theyve never seen these pictures
shakes her head too many questions
she joins truman again at the table
we see an old photo of the smith family linda at age perry their older sister june their brother frank and the parents florence american indian and john irish in
front of their rundown truck on a desolate road
frank shot himself
now perrys did what he did
i suppose im next
some ruination will visit me
i dont think life works that way
it does in this family
truman turns the page
a picture of perry and linda holding hands and splashing in a big mud puddle in the rain
linda is smiling at perry who is naked laughing
i used to love him
he was my little doll
he turns the page
a picture of perry and linda sitting on the back steps of a shack poking with a stick at something in the dirt
after a moment she gets up clears coffee cups
he scares me now
when was the last time you saw him
she picks up the album to put it away
do you think i could borrow one of those pictures
hands it to him take the whole thing
i dont wantem anymore
perry doesnt know where i live
he thinks were still in portland
please dont tell him were not
he already has alright
dont be taken in by my brother
hes got this sensitive side hell show
you believe hes gentle so easily hurt
but hed just as soon kill you as shake your hand
i believe that
truman slows for a moment as he passes hickocks cell
hickock just stares at him
truman unnerved moves on to perrys cell
perry doing pushups
he sees truman and stops
the row guard approaches
you want to go in
truman regards perry for a few moments then yes the guard unlocks the door
perry starts to move toward it
the guard slams it shut
whats the name of your book
perry can barely control his anger
whats the name of your book
whats the name of your book
i dont know what youre talking about
perry picks up a cut out article from the ny times from his desk
truman capote read last night before a packed audience from his non fiction book in cold blood
he looks at truman
reads the true crime novel tells of killers richard hickock and perry smith who brutally murdered a kansas family three years ago
who sent that to you
perry doesnt answer
who sent that to you
thats not your goddamn business
it is my business because its not true
the organizers of the reading needed a title
they picked one a sensational one i admit to attract a crowd
they picked it
thats not your title
i havent chosen one yet
perry stares at him not believing
how could i choose you pretend to be my friend
how could i choose a title when you still havent told me what happened that night
how could i
i couldnt possibly
truman reaches in his breast pocket and extracts a photo the one of perry and linda splashing in the puddle
i have something from your sister
he hands it through the bars to perry
perry takes it
she misses you
perry looks at the photo
after a few moments truman turns to the guard
ill go in
the guard unlocks the cell
the guard locks up walks away
perry is still looking at the photo
i should have told you what they made me call the book
touches perrys arm i couldnt pretend to be your friend
the truth is i cant help wanting to be
silence then you dont have to tell me anything if you dont want to
perry looks at the photo of himself and his sister for a long time
look at my belly
perry sits on the bed
then almost to himself there must be something wrong with us
to do what we did
truman waits him out sitting on the chair
finally perry looks at him
when perry speaks it is quietly completely matter of fact
we heard there was ten thousand dollars in that house
once wed tied up everybody and searched all over i knew the guy who told us about it was wrong
there wasnt any money
but dick wouldnt believe it
he went tearing through the house again banging on the walls looking for a safe
he said when he was done he was going to come up to nancys room and have his way with her
i wouldnt allow it
i told him that
i sat with nancy
perry and nancy
perry sits quietly on the edge of nancys bed
a small bedside lamp softly illuminates a portion of the room
we hear dick banging around downstairs
it was nice in there
the scene is almost sweet until we see that nancys legs and hands are tied and her mouth is taped
perry talking to truman
dick came to get me and we turned out the lights and went down to the basement where we had mr
clutter and the boy
dick kept saying no witnesses
i figured if i just waited him out hed give up and leave them tied up there
wed drive all night theyd never find us
clutters wrists were tied to a pipe over his head
he looked like he was hurt so i cut him down
herbert clutter is bound and taped his hands tied to a pipe on the low ceiling
perry cuts the rope with a hunting knife catches hold of herb clutter lowers him onto a mattress box on the floor
perry talking to truman
we put a box there on the floor so hed be more comfortable
he asked if his wife and daughter were alright and i said they were fine they were ready to go to sleep
i told him it wasnt long till morning when somebody would find them
beat he was looking at me
looking at me
looking at my eyes
like he expects me to kill him expects me to be the kind of person who would kill him
i was thinking this nice man hes scared of me
i was ashamed
i mean i thought he was a kind man a good
i thought so right up to the moment i cut his throat
i didnt realize what id did till i heard the sound
herb clutter gurgling on the floor
like some one drowning under water
perry and truman
silence then i was staring at him bleeding on the floor
i told dick to finish him off but he wouldnt do it
we couldnt leave mr
clutter like that so i got the shotgun
perry approaches with a shotgun
he aims and shoots him in the face
kenyon clutter is bound and gagged on an old sofa a pillow under his head
a flashlight illuminates his face
a shotgun enters frame fires
an enormous burst of light
bonnie clutter s small and thin tied up on her bed
moonlight through the window
we went to mrs
the door opens
perry and dick walk in with a flashlight
perry points the shotgun at bonnies face fires
a burst of perry and dick enter nancys room shine the flashlight on her face
she looks at perry
she has been crying
after a moment she turns her face to the wall as if she knows what is coming and doesnt want to watch it
perry aims the shotgun at the back of her head
the flashlight switches off
the shotgun fires
a burst of light
perry and truman
perry still on the bed
truman sits not moving on the chair
then we drove off
perry looks at truman
what do you think of me now
then added up how much money did you get from the clutters
between forty and fifty dollars
they sit there for a long time
fade in hands typing on a manual typewriter
truman typing at the desk
he stops removes the page from the typewriter places it on top of a small stack of pages
he sits back
truman in his seat sips a drink
he looks out the window
truman walks with his travel bag on his shoulder
he takes out his keys and turns up the steps to his house
truman opens the door
he walks down the hall to the bedroom
truman enters drops his travel bag on the bed zips it open removes a small stack of typed pages
he walks to his desk
on the desk we see a huge stack of typed pages with a title page on top which reads in cold blood
truman lifts the huge stack places the small stack under it
he smooths out the pages then steps back from it
he calls out jack
on truman standing in the middle of his room
he has finished all that he can finish and is lost as to what to do next
title up one year later i want to give it to you
the truth is im desperate to be done with it
truman on the phone in pajamas looking in the fridge
ive spent four years of my life on this book
they got a stay of execution yesterday
he gets out a jar of bonnet baby food custard and starts to eat it
truman finds a bottle of j b on the counter and pours a shot in his custard
he stirs the custard eats it
its harrowing all i want is to write the ending and theres no fucking end in sight
no i havent been drinking again
truman sits on the bed with a glass of bourbon staring at the television
an empty jar of baby custard sits on the bedside table
truman on the bed the television still on another drink
we hear a doorbell
we hear jack walk down the hall answer the door shut the door
jack enters with a telegram
i dont know how you can eat that
perhaps if you werent drinking so much you wouldnt have to
jack turns down the television opens the telegram
reads dear friend truman
havent heard from you in such a long while
please help find new lawyer
if not dick will have to write supreme court brief himself
our last appeal
what a pair of wretched creatures
jack looks at truman
truman stares back
finally he turns back to the television
put it with the others
jack goes to the desk and places the telegram on top of a large pile of telegrams all from perry all we should assume unanswered
jack walks out
truman sips his drink
truman at the desk still in pajamas typing
jack enters wearing a tuxedo reads over trumans shoulder
unable to find laywer despite extensive search
all best truman
truman extracts the page from the typewriter folds it and puts it in an envelope
he takes a sip of his bourbon
walking out you need to get ready
truman and jack are driven
both wear tuxedos and overcoats
truman and jack sit in silence then at least pretend for nelle that youre having a good time tonight
the limo turns a corner and we see an enormous crowd in front of a theater
on the marquee it says opening tonight to it is cold
truman and jacks limo pulls up
an usher opens their door
truman obviously drunk preens and poses on the red carpet for the cameras
jack watches from the side
huge party in progress
nelle walks through the crowd
people turn to her saying congratulations wonderful
she finds truman sitting at the bar receiving a new drink
she looks uncomfortably dolled up for the premiere of her movie
i thought id find you here
to the bartender please another
he hands nelle his drink receives another
after a moment how are you
im sorry to hear that
he drinks what theyre doing to me
now the supreme court
can you believe it
if they win this appeal i will have a complete nervous breakdown
i may never recover
just pray things turn my way
it must be hard
theyre torturing me
nelle regards him for a moment
and howd you like the movie truman
she puts her drink down on the bar and walks away
truman turns back to the bartender shrugs
i frankly dont know what the fuss is about
on truman alone at the bar
fade up on a paper boy riding his bike down the street
new buds are on the trees
it is spring
the boy wears a new york times bag slung over his chest and is tossing copies of the paper
one of them lands on truman and jacks stoop
jack is writing longhand at his desk
phone is ringing
jack notices that his door is slightly ajar
he kicks it shut
the ringing is much quieter
he keeps writing
he wakes up groggy answers
i have a call from mr
perry smith in the kansas correctional system
will you accept charges
will you accept charges
no way out of this uh
youll accept charges
smith youre on the line
now trumans awake
we hear a series of clicks then hello
truman cant bring himself to speak
i cant to someone this doesnt seem we hear perry clicking the cradle then operator i dont think you put me im here
they let me make a couple phone calls before i go down to holding
you heard the supreme court rejected the appeal

truman doesnt know what to say
weve got a date set for the warehouse dick and me
two weeks and
will you visit me

i dont know if i can
beat i dont know if i can
we hear over the line a guard in the background time smith
hang it up
please visit me truman
truman sits very still the phone in his hand
perry and dick being shackled their belongings packed into boxes
one of the guards in perrys cell clangs the bars with his stick
perry lies alone on his cot
the door opens krutch enters with a guard
perry sits up
krutch sits on the one chair
the guard stands by the door takes out a pad and stubby pencil
youre allowed three names of people youd like to witness tomorrow
if theres anybody you want tell me now
krutch nods to the guard who writes the name down
krutch waits then anybody else
perry shakes his head
in a chair near the window truman sits awake in his pajamas unable to sleep completely unable to decide what to do
he watches jack sleep
a long time then truman walks to the closet gets out a travel bag starts to pack
a plane takes off
truman sits next to william shawn who looks exhausted
the stewardess is approaching with the drinks cart
she collects an empty baby custard jar from trumans tray
you want anything
truman shakes his head
outside lights switch on as it gets dark
perry sits alone
the door opens and a guard brings in his last meal three hot dogs french fries an ice cream sundae a strawberry soda
the guard sets it down on the chair
then you sent the telegram to his hotel
perry looks at the clock on the wall its after pm
may i make a phone call
the clock rads pm
empty drinks glasses a custard jar
truman lies curled in a fetal position on the bed
shawn walks the floor exasperated
thats him again
truman is immobile
phone still rings
weve never even met
it is utterly inappropriate for me to be talking to him
shawn gives up picks up the phone
im sorry hes out gone out
im not sure when
krutch walks with a telegram page in hand
a guard follows
they pass a wall clock pm
krutch and guard enter perrys cell
perry hasnt touched his meal
you got a telex
krutch reads perry
unable to visit today because not permitted
always your friend truman
apologetically thats it
its not true is it
krutch hesitates a moment then shakes his head
nelle on the phone looking at a telegram
the kitchen clock reads pm
she waits a moment till the line is answered
i just got this telegram has he seen it
intercut with william shawn on the phone in trumans hotel room
a telegram lies on the desk
truman lies on the bed
he wont look at it
would you put him on please
he wont talk
shawn if you have to hold him down and put the phone on his ear i need to speak to him
shawn terrifically uncomfortable walks over to truman and holds the phone out to him
a moment then truman takes the phone
on trumans face
we hear through the receiver nelle truman
truman finally breathes out
perry is led shackled into a holding cell on the ground floor of the death row building
dick is already there seated shackled
we hear perrys voice miss nelle harper lee and truman capote sorry that truman was unable to make it here at the prison for a brief word prior to necktie
the clock reads pm
through the window we see activity in the gallows warehouse across the yard
whatever his reason for not showing up i want him to know that i cannot condemn him for it and understand
perry makes eye contact with the guard who chews gum
the guard checks through the small window in the door then approaches perry places a stick of gum in perrys mouth
not much time left but want you both to know that ive been sincerely grateful for your friendship through the years and everything else
truman opens the door to the other part of the suite where william shawn is waiting
truman is fully dressed and ready
perrys voice im not very good at these things
taxicab pulls up to the prison gates
perrys voice i have become extremely affectionate toward you both
but harness time
your friend perry
clock reads pm
truman sits with shawn
truman is looking at the telegram from perry
he folds it puts it in the breast pocket of his jacket
i didnt think id be seeing you again
then you can visit for a few minutes
truman stands turns to shawn still seated
come with me
truman goes alone
perry dick a guard
krutch lets truman in
he exits closes the door
truman doesnt know what to say
without rancor he returns
i dont know what you must think of me
you havent been foremost on my mind lately
as you can imagine
dick looks at perry and smiles
perry chews his gum and smiles back then looks to truman who seems upset
you got the letter
i mean i understand why you didnt want to come
i wouldnt be here either if i didnt have to
you got that right
you know ricardo donated his eyes to science
next week some blind man will be seeing what dick used to see
laughs hed be better off the way he was
what ive seen hasnt been so nice to look at but i guess its better than nothing
he shrugs to truman they came around with a form
youll be walking down the street one day in denver wherever and suddenly these eyes will be staring at you
wouldnt that be something
quietly it would be
krutch opens the door
truman looks at the clock pm
truman turns to perry and dick
youll be watching
i dont know
do you want me to
id like to have a friend there
then i will
truman looks down starts to cry
i did everything i could
i truly did
truman nods wipes his eyes
youre not rid of me yet
ill see you in a few minutes
on perry watching him leave
twenty men stand around some smoking
some are silent
some whisper quietly
also alvin dewey and the kbi men church and nye
krutch in front of the gallows with a chaplain
at the foot of the gallows steps the executioner thin older a too large pin striped suit and stained cowboy hat
headlights then a prison car enters stops
dick is extracted from the back seat
he stands looks at the crowd then at the gallows
the guards nudge him forward
clock reads pm
perry sits alone looking at his hands
we hear a trap door spring and clatter
perry looks up
light rain outside
perry in the back seat being driven across the yard
he looks out his window sees a pickup truck drive out of the corner warehouse
on it a body covered by a black the prison car enters stops
perry is removed from the back seat
he stands looks at the assembled men looks at truman
hes nudged forward
as he passes dewey he extends his hand nice to see you
dewey is caught off guard so shakes his hand
perry is led to the base of the gallows
perry edward smith
reads for the crime of murder in the first degree by order of the court of finney county and the supreme court of the sovereign state of kansas you are
sentenced to hang until you die
then you can say something if you want
quietly to krutch is there anybody from the family here
perry is disappointed by this information
he look out at everyone i cant remember what i was going to say for the life of me
krutch cant tell if hes done
finally krutch nods to the guard
perry is led up the steps
the chaplain follows
though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me
the executioner puts the noose around perrys neck
perry chews his gum
executioner opens a black cloth sack
perry looks at the chaplain reading prayers looks at the crowd at truman
thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
the black sack goes over perrys head
he stands next to alvin dewey
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies
thou annointest my head with oil
the executioner pulls the handle perry drops
my cup runneth over
then a wide shot of the inside of the warehouse twenty men watching perry smith hang the chaplain reading
the sound of a telephone ringing as heard through the receiver
we hear the click of the phone being picked up then after a moment a voice hello
truman sits on the edge of the bed in his wet overcoat as if hed walked in the rain
someday ill tell you about it
for the moment im too shattered
theyre dead truman
it was a terrible experience and i will never get over it
then there wasnt anything i could have done to save them
we hear nelle light a cigarette
we hear her exhale slowly
but the fact is you didnt want to
on truman truman seated on the aisle next to william shawn
after a long silence he extracts from his leather briefcase a package wrapped in brown paper
hands it to truman
it came to the hotel this morning
i told them id give it to you
the package says kansas state penitentiary and is addressed to truman
truman opens it
he takes out perrys notebooks the diary and personal dictionary
he opens the diary
toward the end he finds perrys final entry
he reads silently
we hear perrys voice did we not know we were to die we would be children
by knowing it we are given the opportunity to mature in spirit
truman turns the page
he closes the diary
we continue to hear perrys voice as truman takes out a snapshot the one of perry at age and linda splashing in the puddle
some take that opportunity
i hope i have
truman takes out a pencil drawing perry did of him
its very good though truman looks old and weary in it
life is only the father of wisdom
death is the mother
truman finds at the bottom of the package his tie
he takes it out clutches it
truman grasps for william shawns hand finds it holds on tightly
shawn sits stoically hoping no one will notice
the camera pulls back up the aisle
truman clutches the tie and holds on to shawns hand for dear life
title up each title fades up in succession in cold blood made truman capote the most famous writer in america
he never finished another book
the epigraph he chose for his last published work reads more tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones
he died in of complications due to alcoholism
