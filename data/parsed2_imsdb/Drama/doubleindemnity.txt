cain it is night about two oclock very light traffic
at the left and in the immediate foreground a semaphore traffic signal stands at go
approaching it at about thirty miles per hour is a dodge coupe
it is driven erratically and weaving a little but not out of control
when the car is about forty feet away the signal changes to stop
car makes no attempt to stop but comes on through
is crossing the intersection at right angles
it swerves and skids to avoid the dodge which goes on as though nothing had happened
the truck stops with a panicky screech of tires
there is a large sign on the truck read the los angeles times
the truck drivers infuriated face stares after the coupe
continues along the street still weaving then slows down and pulls over towards the curb in front of a tall office building
the headlights are turned off
for a second nothing happens then the car door opens slowly
a man eases himself out onto the sidewalk and stands a moment leaning on the open door to support himself
hes a tall man about thirty five years old
from the way he moves there seems to be something wrong with his left shoulder
he straightens up and painfully lowers his left hand into his jacket pocket
he leans into the car
he brings out a light weight overcoat and drapes it across his shoulders
he shuts the car door and walks toward the building
above the closed double plate glass doors is lettered pacific building
to the left of entrance there is a drugstore closed dark except for a faint light in the back
the man comes stiffly up to the doors
camera has moved up with him
he tries the doors
they are locked
he knocks on the glass
inside over his shoulder the lobby of the building is visible a side entrance to the drugstore on the left in the rear a barber shop and cigar and magazine
stand closed up for the night and to the right two elevators
one elevator is open and its dome light falls across the dark lobby
the man knocks again
the night watchman sticks his head out of the elevator and looks toward entrance
he comes out with a newspaper in one hand and a half eaten sandwich in the other
he finishes the sandwich on the way to the doors looks out and recognizes the man outside unlocks the door and pulls it open
hello there mr
neff walks in past him without answering
neff is walking towards elevator
night watchman looks after him relocks door follows to elevator
neff enters elevator
neff stands leaning against wall
he is pale and haggard with pain but deadpans as night watchman joins him
working pretty late arent you mr
tight lipped late enough
you look kind of all in at that
night watchman pulls lever doors close and elevator rises
hows the insurance business mr
they wouldnt ever sell me any
they say ive got something loose in my heart
i say its rheumatism
scarcely listening uh huh
night watchman looks around at him turns away again and the elevator stops
the door opens
across a small dark reception room a pair of frosted glass doors are lettered pacific all risk insurance company founded main office
there is a little light beyond the glass doors
neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator across reception room to doors
he pushes them open
the night watchman stares after him morosely works lever elevator doors start to close
note for set designer our insurance company occupies the entire eleventh and twelfth floors of the building
on the twelfth floor are the executive offices and claims and sales departments
these all open off a balcony which runs all the way around
from the balcony you see the eleventh floor below one enormous room filled with desks typewriters filing cabinets business machines etc
neff comes through the double entrance doors from the reception room
the twelfth floor is dark
some light shines up from the eleventh floor
neff takes a few steps then holds on to the balcony railing and looks down
two colored women are cleaning the offices
one is dry mopping the floor the other is moving chairs back into position etc
a colored man is emptying waste baskets into a big square box
he shuffles a little dance step as he moves and hums a little tune
moves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face and walks past two or three offices camera with him towards a glass door with number twenty seven
on it and three names henry b
anderson walter neff louis l
neff opens the door
three desks filing cabinets one typewriter on stand one dictaphone on fixed stand against wall with rack of records underneath telephones on all three desks
water cooler with inverted bottle and paper cup holder beside it
two windows facing toward front of building
waste basket full ash trays not emptied
the office has not been cleaned
neff enters switches on desk lamp
he looks across at dicta phone goes heavily to it and lifts off the fabric cover
he leans down hard on the dictaphone stand as if feeling faint
he turns away from dictaphone takes a few uncertain steps and falls heavily into a swivel chair
his head goes far back his eyes close cold sweat shows on his face
for a moment he stays like this exhausted then his eyes open slowly and look down at his left shoulder
his good hand flips the overcoat back he unbuttons his jacket loosens his tie and shirt
this was quite an effort
he rests for a second breathing hard
with the help of his good hand he edges his left elbow up on the arm rest of the chair supports it there and then pulls his jacket wide
a heavy patch of dark blood shows on his shirt
he pushes his chair along the floor towards the water cooler using his feet and his right hand against the desk takes out a handkerchief presses with his hand against
the spring faucet of the cooler soaks the handkerchief in water and tucks it dripping wet against the wound inside his shirt
next he gets a handful of water and splashes it on his face
the water runs down his chin and drips
he breathes heavily with closed eyes
he fingers a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket pulls it out looks at it
there is blood on it
he wheels himself back to the desk and dumps the loose cigarettes out of the packet
some are blood stained a few are clean
he takes one puts it between his lips gropes around for a match lights cigarette
he takes a deep drag and lets smoke out through his nose
he pulls himself toward dictaphone again still in the swivel chair reaches it lifts the horn off the bracket and the dictaphone makes a low buzzing sound
he presses the button switch on the horn
the sound stops the record revolves on the cylinder
he begins to speak office memorandum walter neff to barton keyes claims manager
los angeles july th
dear keyes i suppose youll call this a confession when you hear it
i dont like the word confession
i just want to set you right about one thing you couldnt see because it was smack up against your nose
you think youre such a hot potato as a claims manager such a wolf on a phoney claim
well maybe you are keyes but lets take a look at this dietrichson claim accident and double indemnity
you were pretty good in there for a while all right
you said it wasnt an accident
you said it wasnt suicide
you said it was murder
check and double check
you thought you had it cold all wrapped up in tissue paper with pink ribbons around it
it was perfect except that it wasnt because you made a mistake just one tiny little mistake
when it came to picking the killer you picked the wrong guy if you know what i mean
want to know who killed dietrichson
hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours keyes
i killed dietrichson
me walter neff insurance agent years old unmarried no visible scars he glances down at his wounded shoulder until a little while ago that is
yes i killed him
i killed him for money and a woman and i didnt get the money and i didnt get the woman
pretty isnt it
he interrupts the dictation lays down the horn on the desk
he takes his lighted cigarette from the ash tray puffs it two or three times and kills it
he picks up the horn again
his voice is now quiet and contained it began last may
about the end of may it was
i had to run out to glendale to deliver a policy on some dairy trucks
on the way back i remembered this auto renewal on los feliz
so i decided to run over there
it was one of those calif
spanish houses everyone was nuts about or years ago
this one must have cost somebody about bucks that is if he ever finished paying for it
as he goes on speaking slow dissolve to palm trees line the street middle class houses mostly in spanish style
some kids throwing a baseball back and forth across a couple of front lawns
an ice cream wagon dawdles along the block
neffs coupe meets and passes the ice cream wagon and stops before one of the spanish houses
neff gets out
he carries a briefcase his hat is a little on the back of his head
his movements are easy and full of ginger
he inspects the house checks the number goes up on the front porch and rings the bell
it was mid afternoon and its funny i can still remember the smell of honeysuckle all along that block
i felt like a million
there was no way in all this world i could have known that murder sometimes can smell like honeysuckle
neff rings the bell again and waits
the door opens
a maid about forty five rather slatternly opens the door
who wants to see him
the name is neff
if youre selling something look its mr
dietrichson id like to talk to and its not magazine subscriptions
he pushes past her into the house
spanish craperoo in style as is the house throughout
a wrought iron staircase curves down from the second floor
a fringed mexican shawl hangs down over the landing
a large tapestry hangs on the wall
downstairs the dining room to one side living room on the other side visible through a wide archway
all of this architecture furniture decorations etc
is genuine early leo carrillo period
neff has edged his way in past maid who still holds the door open
dietrichsons not in
how soon do you expect him
hell be home when he gets here if thats any help to you
at this point a voice comes from the top of the stairs
what is it nettie
who is it
neff looks up
phyllis dietrichson stands looking down
she is in her early thirties
she holds a large bath towel around her very appetizing torso down to about two inches above her knees
she wears no stockings no nothing
on her feet a pair of high heeled bedroom slippers with pom poms
on her left ankle a gold anklet
its for mr
looking down at neff im mrs
what is it
neff looks up takes his hat off
how do you do mrs
im walter neff pacific all risk
pacific all what
pacific all risk insurance company
its about some renewals on the automobiles mrs
ive been trying to contact your husband for the past two weeks
hes never at his office
is there anything i can do
the insurance ran out on the fifteenth
id hate to think of your getting a smashed fender or something while youre not fully covered
she glances over her towel costume
with a little smile perhaps i know what you mean mr
ive just been taking a sun bath
no pigeons around i hope
about those policies mrs
dietrichson i hate to take up your time thats all right
if you can wait till i put something on ill be right down
nettie show mr
neff into the living room
she turns away as gracefully as one can with a towel for a wrapper
neff watches phyllis out of sight
he speaks to the maid while still looking up
where would the living room be
in there but they keep the liquor locked up
i always carry my own keys
he goes through the archway
maid goes off the other way
neff comes into the room and throws his briefcase on the plush davenport and tosses his hat on top of it
he looks around the room then moves over to a baby grand piano with a sleazy spanish shawl dangling down one side and two cabinet photographs standing in a staggered
position on top
neff glances them over mr
dietrichson age about fifty one a big blocky man with glasses and a rotarian look about him lola dietrichson age nineteen wearing a filmy party dress and a yearning look
in her pretty eyes
neff walks away from the piano and takes a few steps back and forth across the rug
his eyes fall on a wrinkled corner
he carefully straightens it out with his foot
his back is to the archway as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase
he turns and looks through the arch
the living room was still stuffy from last nights cigars
the windows were closed and the sunshine coming in through the venetian blinds showed up the dust in the air
the furniture was kind of corny and old fashioned but it had a comfortable look as if people really sat in it
on the piano in couple of fancy frames were mr
dietrichson and lola his daughter by his first wife they had a bowl of those little red goldfish on the table behind the davenport but to tell you the truth
keyes i wasnt a whole lot interested in goldfish right then nor in auto renewals nor in mr
dietrichson and his daughter lola
i was thinking about that dame upstairs and the way she had looked at me and i wanted to see her again close without that silly staircase between us
phyllis dietrichson is coming downstairs
first we see her feet with pom pom slippers and the gold anklet on her left ankle
camera pulls back slowly as she descends until we see all of her
she is wearing a pale blue summer dress
i wasnt long was i
not at all mrs
i hope ive got my face on straight
its perfect for my money
crossing to the mirror over the fireplace wont you sit down mr
neff is the name isnt it
with two fs like in philadelphia
if you know the story
the philadelphia story
what are we talking about
she works with her lipstick about the insurance
my husband never tells me anything
its on your two cars the la salle and the plymouth
he crosses to the davenport to get the policies from his briefcase
she turns away from the mirror and sits in a big chair with her legs drawn up sideways the anklet now clearly visible
weve been handling this insurance for three years for mr
his eyes have caught the anklet thats a honey of an anklet youre wearing mrs
phyllis smiles faintly and covers the anklet with her dress
wed hate to see the policies lapse
of course we give him thirty days
thats all were allowed to give
i guess hes been too busy down at long beach in the oil fields
could i catch him home some evening for a few minutes
i suppose so
but hes never home much before eight
that would be fine with me
youre not connected with the automobile club are you
no the all risk mrs
somebody from the automobile club has been trying to get him
do they have a better rate
if your husbands a member
no he isnt
phyllis rises and walks up and down paying less and less attention
well hed have to join the club and pay a membership fee to start with
the automobile club is fine
i never knock the other fellows merchandise mrs
dietrichson but i can do just as well for you
i have a very attractive policy here
it wouldnt take me two minutes to put it in front of your husband
he consults the policies he is holding
for instance were writing a new kind of fifty percent retention feature in the collision coverage
phyllis stops in her walk
youre a smart insurance man arent you mr
ive had eleven years of it
doing pretty well
its a living
you handle just automobile insurance or all kinds
she sits down again in the same position as before
fire earthquake theft public liability group insurance industrial stuff and so on right down the line
his eyes fall on the anklet again
i wish youd tell me whats engraved on that anklet
just my name
as for instance
i think i like that
but youre not sure
id have to drive it around the block a couple of times
standing up again mr
neff why dont you drop by tomorrow evening about eight thirty
hell be in then
you were anxious to talk to him werent you
sure only im getting over it a little
if you know what i mean
theres a speed limit in this state mr
forty five miles an hour
how fast was i going officer
id say about ninety
suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket
suppose i let you off with a warning this time
suppose it doesnt take
suppose i have to whack you over the knuckles
suppose i bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder
suppose you try putting it on my husbands shoulder
that tears it
neff takes his hat and briefcase
eight thirty tomorrow evening then mrs
thats what i suggested
they both move toward the archway
will you be here too
i guess so
i usually am
same chair same perfume same anklet
opening the door i wonder if i know what you mean
i wonder if you wonder
he walks out
shooting past neffs parked car towards the entrance door which is just closing
neff comes towards the car swinging his briefcase
he opens the car door and looks back with a confident smile
over scene she liked me
i could feel that
the way you feel when the cards are
in the upper panel the peep window opens and phyllis looks out after neff
falling right for you with a nice little pile of blue and yellow chips in the middle of the table
only what i didnt know then was that i wasnt playing her
she was playing me with a deck of marked cards and the stakes werent any blue and yellow chips
they were dynamite
i went back to the office that afternoon to see if i had any mail
it was the same afternoon you had that sam gorlopis on the carpet that truck driver from inglewood remember keyes
he sits in his car presses the starter button looking back towards the little window in the entrance door
the peep window is quickly closed from inside
neff makes a u turn and drives back down the block
activity on the eleventh floor below
typewriters working adding machines filing clerks secretaries and so forth
neff wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase enters from the vestibule
he walks towards his office
he passes a few salesmen etc
there is an exchange of greetings
just as he reaches his office a secretary comes out
keyes wants to see you
hes been yelling for you all afternoon
is he sore or just frothing at the mouth a little
here park these for me sweetheart
he hands her his hat and briefcase and continues right on camera with him to a door lettered keyes voice is heard inside plenty loud
neff grins as he opens the door and goes in
a minor executive office not too tidy large desk across one corner good carpet several chairs filing cabinet against one wall a dictaphone on the corner of the desk
keyes is sitting behind the desk with his coat off but his hat on
a cigar is clamped in his mouth ashes falling like snow down his vest a gold chair and elks tooth across it
on the other side of the desk sits sam gorlopis
he is a big dumb bruiser six feet three inches tall a dirty work shirt and corduroy pants rough untidy hair broad face small piggish eyes
he holds a sweat soaked hat on his knee with a hairy hand
he is chewing gum rapidly
as neff opens the door keyes is giving it to gorlopis
wise up gorlopis
youre not kidding anybody with that line of bull
youre in a jam and you know it
all i want is my money
all youre gonna get is the cops
he sees neff standing inside the door
come in walter
this is sam gorlopis from inglewood
sure i know mr
wrote a policy on his truck
how are you mr
i aint so good
my truck burned down
he looks cautiously sideways at keyes
yeah he just planted his big foot on the starter and the whole thing blazed up in his face
and didnt even singe his eyebrows
i got twenty six hundred bucks tied up in that truck
im insured with this company and i want my money
you got a wife gorlopis
sure i got a wife
you got kids
what you got for dinner tonight
we got meat loaf
how do you make your meat loaf gorlopis
veal and pork and bread and garlic
how much garlic
lotsa garlic mr
now listen here
lets say you just came up here to tell me how to make meat loaf
thats all understand
because if you came up here to claim on that truck id have to turn you over to the law gorlopis and theyd put you in jail
no kids what for
yelling and no meat loaf gorlopis
i didnt do nothin
every month hundreds of claims come to this desk
some of them are phonies and i know which ones
how do i know gorlopis
he speaks as if to a child because my little man tells me
what little man
the little man in here
he pounds the pit of his stomach
every time one of those phonies comes along he ties knots in my stomach
and yours was one of them gorlopis
thats how i knew your claim was crooked
so what did i do
i sent a tow car out to your garage this afternoon and they jacked up that burned out truck of yours
and what did they find gorlopis
they found what was left of a pile of shavings
the ones you soaked with kerosene and dropped a match on
gorlopis cringes under the impact
keyes im just a poor guy
maybe i made a mistake
thats one way of putting it
i aint feelin so good mr
sign this and youll feel fine
he puts a blank form in front of him and points
its a waiver on your claim
gorlopis hesitates then signs laboriously
now youre an honest man again
but i aint got no more truck
still bewildered goodbye mr
he stands up and goes slowly to the door and turns there
twenty six hundred bucks
thats a lot of dough where i live
whats the matter gorlopis
dont you know how to open the door
just put your hand on the knob turn it to the right pull it toward you doing just as keyes says like this mr
thats the boy
now the same thing from the outside
stupefied thank you mr
he goes out closing the door after him
keyes takes his cigar stub from his mouth and turns it slowly in the flame of a lighted match
he turns to neff
what kind of an outfit is this anyway
are we an insurance company or a bunch of dimwitted amateurs writing a policy on a mugg like that
wait a minute keyes
i dont rate this beef
i clipped a note to that gorlopis application to have him thoroughly investigated before we accepted the risk
i know you did walter
im not beefing at you
its the company
the way they do things
the way they dont do things
the way theyll write anything just to get it down on the sales sheet
and im the guy that has to sit here up to my neck in phony claims so they wont throw more money out of the window than they take in
at the door
grinning okay turn the record over and lets hear the other side
i get darn sick of picking up after a gang of fast talking salesmen dumb enough to sell life insurance to a guy that sleeps in the same bed with
ive had twenty six years of that walter and i and you loved every minute of it keyes
you love it only you worry about it too much you and your little man
youre so darn conscientious youre driving yourself crazy
you wouldnt even say today is tuesday without you looked at the calendar and then you would check if it was this years or last years calendar and then you
would find out what company printed the calendar then find out if their calendar checks with the world almanacs calendar
thats enough from you walter
get out of here before i throw my desk at you
i love you too
he walks out still grinning
neff comes out of keys office and walks back along the balcony
activity of secretaries going in and out of doors etc
neff enters his own office
over scene i really did too you old crab always yelling your fat head off always sore at everyone
but behind the cigar ashes on your vest i kind of knew you had a heart as big as a house
back in my office there was a phone message from mrs
dietrichson about the renewals
she didnt want me to come tomorrow evening
she wanted me to come thursday afternoon at three thirty instead
i had a lot of stuff lined up for that thursday afternoon including a trip down to santa monica to see a couple of live prospects about some group insurance
but i kept thinking about phyllis dietrichson and the way that anklet of hers cut into her leg
anderson a salesman sits at one of the desks filling out a report
neff enters goes to his own desk
he looks down at some mail
on top there is a typewritten note
he reads it sits down and leafs through his desk calendar
showing date thursday may and five or six appointments penciled in tightly on the page
the camera pans with phyllis dietrichsons feet and ankles as she comes down the stairs her high heels clicking on the tiles
the anklet glistens on her leg as she moves
the camera pans on
phyllis has reached the entrance hall and as she walks toward the front door her whole body becomes visible
she wears a gay print dress with a wide sash over her hips
she opens the door
outside is neff wearing a sport coat flannel slacks
he takes his hat off
he stands there with a little smile
arent you coming in
im considering it
he comes in
i hope you didnt mind my changing the appointment
last night wasnt so convenient
i was working on my stamp collection
she leads him toward living room
phyllis and neff come through archway
she heads toward a low tea table which stands in front of the davenport with tall glasses ice cubes lemon a pot of tea etc
i was just fixing some iced tea
would you like a glass
unless you have a bottle of beer thats not working
there might be some
i never know whats in the ice box
she pours herself a glass of tea
about those renewals mr
i talked to my husband about it
hell renew with you he told me
in fact i thought hed be here this afternoon
but hes not
calls again impatiently nettie
oh i forgot its the maids day off
dont bother mrs
id like some iced tea very much
fix it your way
she fixes him a glass of tea while he is looking around
he slowly sits down
seeing its the maids day off maybe theres something i can do for you
she hands him the tea
like running the vacuum cleaner
i used to peddle vacuum cleaners
not much money but you learn a lot about life
i didnt think youd learned it from a correspondence course
where did you pick up this tea drinking
youre not english are you
born right here in los angeles
they say native californians all come from iowa
i wanted to ask you something mr
make it walter
tell me walter on this insurance how much commission do you make
i thought maybe i could throw a little more business your way
i can always use it
i was thinking about my husband
i worry a lot about him down in those oil fields
its very dangerous
not for an executive is it
he doesnt just sit behind a desk
hes right down there with the drilling crews
its got me worried sick
you mean a crown block might fall on him some rainy night
please dont talk like that
but thats the idea
the other day a casing line snapped and caught the foreman
hes in the hospital with a broken back
its got me jittery just thinking about it
suppose something like that happened to my husband
dont you think he ought to have accident insurance
what kind of insurance could he have
enough to cover doctors and hospital bills
say a hundred and twenty five a week cash benefit
and hed rate around fifty thousand capital sum
thats if he got killed
maybe i shouldnt have said that
i suppose you have to think of everything in your business
dietrichson would understand
im sure i could sell him on the idea of some accident protection
why dont i talk to him about it
you could try
but hes pretty tough going
theyre all tough at first
hes got a lot on his mind
he doesnt want to listen to anything except maybe a baseball game on the radio
sometimes we sit all evening without saying a word to each other
sounds pretty dull
so i just sit and knit
is that what you married him for
maybe i like the way his thumbs hold up the wool
anytime his thumbs get tired i want to ask you something mr
could i get an accident policy for him without bothering him at all
hows that again
that would make it easier for you too
you wouldnt even have to talk to him
i have a little allowance of my own
i could pay for it and he neednt know anything about it
wait a minute
why shouldnt he know
because i know he doesnt want accident insurance
hes superstitious about it
a lot of people are
funny isnt it
if there was a way to get it like that all the worry would be over
you see what i mean walter
ive got good eyesight
you want him to have the policy without him knowing it
and that means without the insurance company knowing that he doesnt know
thats the set up isnt it
is there anything wrong with it
i think its lovely
and then some dark wet night if that crown block fell on him what crown block
only sometimes they have to have a little help
they cant quite make it on their own
i dont know what youre talking about
of course it doesnt have to be a crown block
it can be a car backing over him or he can fall out of an upstairs window
any little thing like that as long as its a morgue job
are you crazy
not that crazy
he picks up his hat
whats the matter
look baby you cant get away with it
get away with what
you want to knock him off dont you baby
thats a horrible thing to say
whod you think i was anyway
a guy that walks into a good looking dames front parlor and says good afternoon i sell accident insurance on husbands
you got one thats been around too long
somebody youd like to turn into a little hard cash
just give me a smile and ill help you collect
boy what a dope i must look to you
i think youre rotten
i think youre swell
so long as im not your husband
get out of here
you bet i will
you bet ill get out of here baby
he goes out
she looks after him
neff bangs the front door shut walks quickly to his car and drives away
over scene so i let her have it straight between the eyes
she didnt fool me for a minute not this time
i knew i had hold of a redhot poker and the time to drop it was before it burned my hand off
i stopped at a drive in for a bottle of beer the one i had wanted all along only i wanted it worse now to get rid of the sour
taste of her iced tea and everything that went with it
i didnt want to go back to the office so i dropped by a bowling alley at third and western and rolled a few lines to get my mind thinking
about something else for a while
shooting past neff sitting behind the wheel of his car the car hop hangs a tray on the door and serves him a bottle of beer
he rolls the ball with an effort at concentration but his mind is not really on the game
it is late afternoon
the apartment house is called the los olivos apartments
it is a six story building in the normandie wilshire district with a basement garage
the camera pans up the front of the building to the top floor windows as a little rain starts to fall
continuing i didnt feel like eating dinner when i left and i didnt feel like a show so i drove home put the car away and went up to my
it is a double apartment of conventional design with kitchen dinette and bathroom squarecut overstuffed borax furniture
gas logs are lit in the imitation fireplace
neff stands by the window with his coat off and his tie loose
raindrops strike against the glass
he turns away impatiently paces up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it pulls one out at random makes a couple of short swings throws the
club on the couch paces again
continuing it had begun to rain outside and i watched it get dark and didnt even turn on the light
that didnt help me either
i was all twisted up inside and i was still holding on to that red hot poker
and right then it came over me that i hadnt walked out on anything at all that the hook was too strong that this wasnt the end between her and
it was only the beginning
the doorbell rings
continuing so at eight oclock the bell would ring and i would know who it was without even having to think as if it was the most natural thing in
neff goes to the door and opens it
neff just looks at her
you forgot your hat this afternoon
she has nothing in her hands but her bag
he looks down at her hands
dont you want me to bring it in
put it on the chair
she comes in
he closes the door
how did you know where i live
its in the phone book
neff switches on the standing lamp
so it is
peel off your coat and sit down
she starts to take off her coat
your husband out
theyre spudding in a new well
he phoned hed be late
about nine thirty
he takes her coat and lays it across the back of a chair
its about time you said youre glad to see me
i knew you wouldnt leave it like that
like it was this afternoon
i must have said something that gave you a terribly wrong impression
you must surely see that
you must never think anything like that about me walter
its not okay
not if you dont believe me
what do you want me to do
i want you to be nice to me
like the first time you came to the house
it cant be like the first time
something has happened
i know it has
its happened to us
thats what i mean
phyllis has moved over to the window
she stares out through the wet window pane
whats the matter now
i feel as if he was watching me
not that he cares about me
not any more
but he keeps me on a leash
so tight i cant breathe
hes in long beach isnt he
i oughtnt to have come
maybe you oughtnt
you want me to go
if you want to
by this time he has hold of her wrist
he draws her to him slowly and kisses her
her arms tighten around him
after a moment he pulls his head back still holding her close
how were you going to do it
walter for the last time she tries to jerk away but he holds her and kisses her again
im crazy about you baby
im crazy about you walter
that perfume on your hair
whats the name of it
i bought it down at ensenada
we ought to have some of that pink wine to go with it
the kind that bubbles
but all i have is bourbon
bourbon is fine walter
he lets her go and moves toward the dinette
it contains a small table and some chairs
a low glass and china cabinet is built between the dinette and kitchen leaving a space like a doorway
the kitchen is the usual apartment house kitchen with stove ice box sink etc
it is quite small
neff goes to the ice box and phyllis drifts in after him
plain water please
get a couple of glasses will you
he points at the china closet
he has taken a tray of ice cubes from the refrigerator and is holding it under the hot water faucet
you know about six months ago a guy slipped on the soap in his bathtub and knocked himself cold and drowned
only he had accident insurance
so they had an autopsy and she didnt get away with it
phyllis has the glasses now
she hands them to him
he dumps some ice cubes into the glasses
he reaches for the whiskey bottle on top of the china closet
and there was another case where a guy was found shot and his wife said he was cleaning a gun and his stomach got in the way
all she collected was a three to ten stretch in tehachapi
perhaps it was worth it to her
neff hands her a glass
see if you can carry this as far as the living room
they move back toward the living room
phyllis and neff go toward the davenport
she is sipping her drink and looking around
its nice here walter
who takes care of it for you
a colored woman comes in twice a week
you get your own breakfast
once in a while i squeeze a grapefruit
the rest i get at the corner drugstore
they sit on the davenport fairly close together
it sounds wonderful
just strangers beside you
you dont know them
you dont hate them
you dont have to sit across the table and smile at him and that daughter of his every morning of your life
oh that little girl on the piano
she lives with us
he thinks a lot more of her than he does of me
ever think of a divorce
he wouldnt give me a divorce
i suppose because it would cost him money
he hasnt got any money
not since he went into the oil business
but he had when you married him
yes he had
and i wanted a home
but that wasnt the only reason
i was his wifes nurse
she was sick for a long time
when she died he was all broken up
i pitied him so
and now you hate him
hes so mean to me
every time i buy a dress or a pair of shoes he yells his head off
he wont let me go anywhere
he keeps me shut up
hes always been mean to me
even his life insurance all goes to that daughter of his
nothing for you at all huh
and nothing is just what im worth to him
so you lie awake in the dark and listen to him snore and get ideas
walter i dont want to kill him
i never did
not even when he gets drunk and slaps my face
only sometimes you wish he was dead
perhaps i do
and you wish it was an accident and you had that policy
for fifty thousand dollars
is that it
perhaps that too
she takes a long drink
the other night we drove home from a party
he was drunk again
when we got into the garage he just sat there with his head on the steering wheel and the motor still running
and i thought what it would be like if i didnt switch it off just closed the garage door and left him there
ill tell you what it would be like if you had that accident policy and tried to pull a monoxide job
we have a guy in our office named keyes
for him a set up like that would be just like a slice of rare roast beef
in three minutes hed know it wasnt an accident
in ten minutes youd be sitting under the hot lights
in half an hour youd be signing your name to a confession
but walter i didnt do it
im not going to do it
not if theres an insurance company in the picture baby
so long as youre honest theyll pay you with a smile but you just try to pull something like that and youll find out
they know more tricks than a carload of monkeys
and if theres a death mixed up in it you havent got a prayer
theyll hang you as sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar baby
she begins to cry
he puts his arms around her and kisses her
just stop thinking about it will you
he holds her tight
their heads touch side by side the camera slowly starts to recede as we neff sits in the swivel chair talking into the dictaphone
he has hooked the wastebasket under his feet to sit more comfortably
as he talks a little cough shakes him now and then
so we just sat there and she kept on crying softly like the rain on the window and we didnt say anything
maybe she had stopped thinking about it but i hadnt
because it all tied up with something i had been thinking about for years since long before i ever ran into phyllis dietrichson
because in this business you cant sleep for trying to figure out the tricks they could pull on you
youre like the guy behind the roulette wheel watching the customers to make sure they dont crook the house
and then one night you get to thinking how you could crook the house yourself
and do it smart
because youve got that wheel right under your hands
and you know every notch in it by heart
and you figure all you need is a plant out in front a shill to put down the bet
and suddenly the doorbell rings and the whole set up is right there in the room with you
look keyes im not trying to whitewash myself
i fought it only maybe i didnt fight it hard enough
the stakes were fifty thousand dollars but they were the life of a man too a man whod never done me any dirt
except he was married to a woman he didnt care anything about and i did
camera moves slowly towards the davenport again
neff sits in one corner with his feet on the low table
he is smoking his cigarette and staring at the ceiling
phyllis has been sitting fairly close to him
she gets up slowly and crosses to her rain coat lying over a chair
ive got to go now walter
neff does not answer
he keeps on staring at the ceiling
she starts to put the rain coat on
will you call me walter
neff still does not answer
he looks at her slowly almost absently
i hate him
i loathe going back to him
you believe me dont you walter
sure i believe you
i cant stand it anymore
what if they did hang me
youre not going to hang baby
its better than going on this way
youre not going to hang baby
because youre going to do it the smart way
because im going to help you
do you know what youre saying
sure i know what im saying
he gets up and grips her arm
were going to do it together
were going to do it right
and im the guy that knows how
there is fierce determination in his voice
his fingers dig into her arm
walter youre hurting me
there isnt going to be any slip up
its got to be perfect
he kisses her
you go now
he leads her towards the door
call me tomorrow
but not from your house
from a booth
and watch your step
every single minute
its got to be perfect understand
straight down the line
they have now reached the door
neff opens it
phyllis stands in the doorway her lips white
straight down the line
she goes quietly
he watches her down the corridor
slowly he closes the door and goes back into the room
he moves across the window and opens it wide
he stands there looking down into the dark street
from below comes the sound of a car starting and driving off
the rain drifts in against his face
he just stands there motionless
his mind is going a hundred miles a minute
neff sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone
on the desk next to him stands a used record
the cylinder on the dictaphone is not turning
he is smoking a cigarette
he kills it then lifts the needle and slides off the record which is on the machine and stands it on end on the desk beside the other used record
he reaches down painfully to take another record from the rack beneath the dictaphone looks at it against the light to make sure it has not been used then slides
it into place on the machine and resets the needle
he lifts the horn and resumes his dictation
the first thing we had to do was fix him up with that accident policy
i knew he wouldnt buy but all i wanted was his signature on an application
so i had to make him sign without his knowing what he was signing
and i wanted a witness other than phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk
i was trying to think with your brains keyes
i wanted all the answers ready for all the questions you were going to spring as soon as dietrichson was dead
neff takes a last drag on his cigarette and kills it by running it under the ledge of the dictaphone stand
he drops the stub on the floor and resumes
a couple of nights later i went to the house
everything looked fine except i didnt like the witness phyllis had brought in
it was dietrichsons daughter lola and it made me feel a little queer in the belly to have her right there in the room playing chinese checkers as if nothing
was going to happen
the checker board is on the davenport between phyllis and lola
dietrichson sits in a big easy chair
his coat and tie are over the back of the chair and the evening paper is lying tumbled on the floor beside him
he is smoking a cigar with the band on it
he has a drink in front of him and several more inside him
in another chair sits neff his briefcase on the floor leaning against his chair
he holds his rate book partly open with a finger in it for a marker
he is going full swing
i suppose you realize mr
dietrichson that not being an employee you are not covered by the state compensation insurance act
the only way you can protect yourself is by having a personal policy of your own
i know all about that
the next thing youll tell me i need earthquake insurance and lightning insurance and hail insurance
phyllis looks up from the checker board and cuts in on the dialogue
lola listens without much interest
to dietrichson if we bought all the insurance they can think up wed stay broke paying for it wouldnt we honey
what keeps us broke is you going out and buying five hats at a crack
who needs a hat in california
i always say insurance is a lot like a hot water bottle
it looks kind of useless and silly hanging on the hook but when you get that stomach ache in the middle of the night it comes in mighty handy
now you want to sell me a hot water bottle
dollar for dollar accident insurance is the cheapest coverage you can buy mr
maybe some other time mr
i had a tough day
just as you say mr
suppose we just settle that automobile insurance tonight
all we need on that is for you to sign an application for renewal
phyllis throws a quick glance at neff
as she looks back she sees that lola is staring down at her wrist watch
phyllis do you mind if we dont finish this game
it bores me stiff
got some thing better to do
yes i have
she gets up
to dietrichson father is it all right if i run along now
run along where
were going roller skating
its not that nino zachetti again
it better not be that zachetti guy
if i ever catch you with that its anne matthews i told you
i also told you were going roller skating
im meeting her at the corner of vermont and franklin the north west corner in case youre interested
and im late already
i hope that is all clear
good night father
good night phyllis
she starts to go
good night miss dietrichson
oh im sorry
good night mr
good night mr
now youre not going to take my car again
id rather be dead
she goes out through the archway
a great little fighter for her weight
dietrichson sucks down a big swallow of his drink
neff has taken two blank forms from his briefcase
he puts the briefcase on mr
dietrichsons lap and lays the forms on top
phyllis is watching closely
this is where you sign mr
the applications for your auto renewals
so youll be protected until the new policies are issued
when will that be
in about a week
just so im covered when i drive up north
neff takes out his fountain pen
san francisco mr
he was a stanford man mr
and he still goes to his class reunion every year
whats wrong with that
cant i have a little fun even once a year
great football school stanford
did you play football mr
almost made the varsity too
neff has unscrewed his fountain pen
he hands it to mr
dietrichson puts on his glasses
on that bottom line mr
neffs and phyllis eyes meet for a split second
both copies please
he withdraws the top copy barely enough to expose the signature line on the supposed duplicate
sign twice huh
one is the agents copy
i need it for my files
in a mutter files
dietrichson grunts and signs again
again neff and phyllis exchange a quick glance
no hurry about the check mr
i can pick it up at your office some morning
casually neff lifts the briefcase and signed applications off dietrichsons lap
how much you taking me for
one forty seven fifty mr
dietrichson stands up
he is about neffs height but a little heavier
i guess thats enough insurance for one evening mr
dietrichson has poured some more whisky into his glass
he tries the siphon but it is empty
he gathers up his coat and tie and picks up his glass
good night mr
neff is zipping up his briefcase
good night mr
good night mrs
bring me some soda when you come up phyllis
dietrichson trundles off towards the archway
to neff i think you left your hat in the hall
phyllis leads the way and neff goes after her his briefcase under his arm
phyllis enters through the living room archway with neff behind her
she leads him towards the door
on the way he picks up his hat
in the background dietrichson begins to ascend the stairs carrying his coat and glass
phyllis and neff move close to the door
they speak in very low voices
all right walter
he signed it didnt he
sure he signed it
you saw him
phyllis opens the door a crack
both look at the stairs where dietrichson is going up
phyllis takes her hand off the doorknob and holds on to neffs arm
looking up watch it will you
phyllis slowly drops her hand from his arm
both look up as dietrichson goes across the balcony and out of sight
that trip to palo alto when does he go
end of the month
he drives huh
he always drives
not this time
youre going to make him take the train
because its all worked out for a train
for a second they stand listening and looking up as if they had heard a sound
its all right
go on walter
theres a clause in every accident policy a little something called double indemnity
the insurance companies put it in as a sort of come on for the customers
it means they pay double on certain accidents
the kind that almost never happen
like for instance if a guy got killed on a train theyd pay a hundred thousand instead of fifty
her eyes widen with excitement were hitting it for the limit baby
thats why its got to be a train
its going to be a train walter
just the way you say
straight down the line
they look at each other
the look is like a long kiss
neff goes out
slowly phyllis closes the door and leans her head against it as she looks up the empty stairway
neff briefcase under his arm comes down the steps to the street where his dodge coupe is parked at the curb
he opens the door and stops looking in
sitting there in the dark corner of the car away from the steering wheel is lola
she wears a coat but no hat
lola gives him a sly smile
neff is a little annoyed
something the matter
ive been waiting for you
i thought you could let me ride with you if youre going my way
neff doesnt like the idea very much
which way would that be
down the hill
remembering oh sure
vermont and franklin
north west corner wasnt it
be glad to miss dietrichson
neff gets into the car
neff puts the briefcase on the ledge behind the drivers seat
he closes the door and starts the car
they drift down the hill
roller skating eh
you like roller skating
i can take it or leave it
neff looks at her curiously
lola meets his glance
only tonight youre leaving it
this is an embarrassing moment for lola
yes i am
you see mr
neff im having a very tough time at home
my father doesnt understand me and phyllis hates me
that does sound tough all right
thats why i have to lie sometimes
you mean its not vermont and franklin
its vermont and franklin all right
only its not anne matthews
its nino zachetti
you wont tell on me will you
id have to think it over
ninos not what my father says at all
he just had bad luck
he was doing pre med at u
and working nights as an usher in a theater downtown
he got behind in his credits and flunked out
then he lost his job for talking back
hes so hot headed
that comes expensive doesnt it
i guess my father thinks nobodys good enough for his daughter except maybe the guy that owns standard oil
would you like a stick of gum
never use it thanks
lola puts a stick of gum in her mouth
i cant give nino up
i wish father could see it my way
itll straighten out all right miss dietrichson
i suppose it will sometime
looking out this is the corner right here mr
neff brings the car to a stop by the curb
there he is
by the bus stop
neff looks out
zachetti stands waiting hands in trouser pockets
he is about twenty five italian looking open shirt not well dressed
he needs a hair cut doesnt he
look at him
no job no car no money no prospects no nothing
pause i love him
she leans over and honks on the horn
he turns around and looks towards the car
over here nino
zachetti walks towards the car
neff and lola
she has opened the door
zachetti comes up
this is mr
belligerent from the first word the name is zachetti
neff gave me a ride from the house
i told him all about us
why does he have to get told about us
we dont have to worry about mr
im not doing any worrying
just dont you broadcast so much
whats the matter with you nino
hes a friend
i dont have any friends
and if i did i like to pick them myself
look sonny she needed the ride and i brought her along
is that anything to get tough about
all right lola make up your mind
are you coming or arent you
of course im coming
dont mind him mr
lola steps out of the car
thanks a lot
youve been very sweet
lola catches up with zachetti and they walk away together
neff looks after them
slowly he puts the car in gear and drives on
his face is tight
behind his head light catches the metal of the zipper on the briefcase
over the shot comes the commentary she was a nice kid and maybe he was a little better than he sounded
i kind of hoped so for her sake but right then it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all with that briefcase right behind my
head and her fathers application in it
besides i had other problems to work out
there were plans to make and phyllis had to be in on them
there is a fair amount of activity but the place is not crowded
neff comes along the sidewalk into the shot
he passes in front of the fruit and vegetable display and goes between the stalls into the market
continued but we couldnt be seen together any more and i had told her never to call me from her house and never to call me at my office
so we had picked out a big market on los feliz
she was to be there buying stuff every day about eleven oclock and i could run into her there
kind of accidentally on purpose
neff stops by the cashiers desk and buys a pack of cigarettes
as he is opening the pack he looks back casually beyond the turnstile into the rear part of the market
the shelves are loaded with canned goods and other merchandise
customers move around selecting articles and putting them in their baskets
phyllis is seen among them standing by the soap section
her basket is partly filled
she wears a simple house dress no hat and has a large envelope pocketbook under her arm
neff has spotted phyllis
without haste he passes through the turnstile towards the back
phyllis is putting a can of cleaning powder into her basket
neff enters the shot and moves along the shelves towards her very slowly pretending to inspect the goods
a customer passes and goes on out of scene
phyllis and neff are now very close
during the ensuing low spoken dialogue they continue to face the shelves not looking at each other walter
not so loud
i wanted to talk to you walter
ever since yesterday
let me talk first
its all set
the accident policy came through
ive got it in my pocket
i got his check too
i saw him down in the oil fields
he thought he was paying for the auto insurance
the checks just made out to the company
it could be for anything
but you have to send a check for the auto insurance see
its all right that way because one of the cars is yours
but listen walter quick open your bag
she hesitates then opens it
neff looks around quickly slips the policy out of his pocket and drops it into her bag
she snaps the bag shut
can you get into his safe deposit box
we both have keys
but dont put the policy in there yet
ill tell you when
and listen you never touched it or even saw it understand
im not a fool
when is he taking the train
walter thats just it
he isnt going
thats what ive been trying to tell you
the trip is off
he breaks off as a short squatty woman pushing a child in a walker comes into sight and approaches
she stops beside neff who is pretending to read a label on a can
phyllis puts a few cakes of soap into her basket
to neff mister could you reach me that can of coffee
she points that one up there
reaching up this one
neff reaches a can down from the high shelf and hands it to her
i dont see why they always have to put what i want on the top shelf
she moves away with her coffee and her child
out of the corner of his eye neff watches her go
he moves closer to phyllis again
he had a fall down at the well
he broke his leg
its in a cast
that knocks it on the head all right
what do we do walter
wait for what
until he can take a train
i told you its got to be a train
we cant wait
i cant go on like this
were not going to grab a hammer and do it quick just to get it over with
there are other ways
only were not going to do it other ways
but we cant leave it like this
what do you think would happen if he found out about this accident policy
but not as bad as sitting in that death house
dont ever talk like that walter
just dont lets start losing our heads
its not our heads
its our nerve were losing
were going to do it right
thats all i said
walter maybe its my nerves
its the waiting that gets me
its getting me just as bad baby
but weve got to wait
maybe we have walter
only its so tough without you
its like a wall between us
neff looks at his watch
good bye baby
im thinking of you every minute
he goes off
she stares after him
he is wearing a light grey suit and has his hat on
he is standing behind his desk opening some mail taking a few papers out of his briefcase checking something in his rate book making a quick telephone call
but nothing of this is heard
after that a full week went by and i didnt see her once
i tried to keep my mind off her and off the whole idea
i kept telling myself that maybe those fates they say watch over you had gotten together and broken his leg to give me a way out
then it was the fifteenth of june
you may remember that date keyes
i do too only for a very different reason
you came into my office around three in the afternoon
keyes enters with some papers in his hand
i just came from nortons office
the semi annual sales records are out
youre high man walter
thats twice in a row
how would you like a cheap drink
how would you like a fifty dollar cut in salary
how would i do i laugh now or wait until it gets funny
im serious walter
ive been talking to norton
theres too much stuff piling up on my desk
too much pressure on my nerves
i spend half the night walking up and down in my bed
ive got to have an assistant
i thought that you me
why pick on me
because ive got a crazy idea you might be good at the job
thats crazy all right
im a salesman
a peddler a glad hander a back slapper
youre too good to be a salesman
nobodys too good to be a salesman
all you guys do is ring door bells and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk
whats bothering you is that fifty buck cut isnt it
thatd bother anybody
the job im talking about takes brains and integrity
it takes more guts than there is in fifty salesman
its the hottest job in the business
its still a desk job
i dont want a desk job
a desk job
is that all you can see in it
just a hard chair to park your pants on from nine to five
just a pile of papers to shuffle around and five sharp pencils and a scratch pad to make figures on with maybe a little doodling on the side
thats not the way i see it walter
to me a claims man is a surgeon and that desk is an operating table and those pencils are scalpels and bone chisels
and those papers are not just forms and statistics and claims for compensation
theyre alive theyre packed with drama with twisted hopes and crooked dreams
a claims man walter is a doctor and a blood hound and a cop and a judge and a jury and a father confessor all in one
the telephone rings on neffs desk
automatically keyes grabs the phone and answers
okay hold the line
he puts the phone down on the desk and continues to neff and you want to tell me youre not interested
you dont want to work with your brains
all you want to work with is your finger on a door bell
for a few bucks more a week
theres a dame on your phone
neff picks the phone up and answers
walter neff speaking
phyllis is on the phone
i had to call you walter
its terribly urgent
are you with somebody
neff on the phone
his eye catches keyes who is walking up and down
of course i am
cant i call you back
walter ive only got a minute
it cant wait
hes going tonight
on the train
are you listening walter
his eyes are on keyes
he speaks into the phone as calmly as possible
only make it short
hes on crutches
the doctor says he can go if hes careful
the change will do him good
its wonderful walter
just the way you wanted it
only with the crutches its ever so much better isnt it
neff on phone
one hundred percent better
hold the line a minute
he covers the receiver with his hand and turns to keyes who is now standing at the window
suppose i join you in your office keyes he makes a gesture as if expecting keyes to leave
keyes stays right where he is
only tell margie not to take all day
neff looks at keyes back with a strained expression then lifts the phone again
its the ten fifteen from glendale
im driving him
is it still that same dark street
he is still watching keyes cautiously
the signal is three honks on the horn
is there anything else
what color did you pick out
she catches on oh sure
the blue suit walter
and the cast on his left leg
i like that fine
this is it walter
im shaking like a leaf
but its straight down the line now for both of us
i love you walter
neff on the phone
so long margie
he hangs up
his mouth is grim but he forces a smile as keyes turns
im sorry keyes
whats the matter
the dames chasing you again
or is it none of my business
with a sour smile if i told you it was a customer margie
i bet she drinks from the bottle
why dont you settle down and get married walter
why dont you for instance
i almost did once
a long time ago
neff gets up from his desk
look keyes ive got a prospect to call on
keyes drives right ahead
we even had the church all picked out the dame and i
she had a white satin dress with flounces on it
and i was on my way to the jewelry store to buy the ring
then suddenly that little man in here started working on me
he punches his stomach with his fist
so you went back and started investigating her
keyes nods slowly a little sad and a little ashamed
and the stuff that came out
shed been dyeing her hair ever since she was sixteen
and there was a manic depressive in her family on her mothers side
and she already had one husband a professional pool player in baltimore
and as for her brother i get the general idea
she was a tramp from a long line of tramps
he picks up some papers impatiently
all right im going
what am i to say to norton
how about that job i want you for
i dont think i want it
thanks keyes just the same
just get this i picked you for the job not because i think youre so darn smart but because i thought maybe you were a shade less dumb than the
rest of the outfit
i guess i was all wet
youre not smarter walter
youre just a little taller
he goes out
neff is alone
he watches the door close then turns and goes slowly to the water cooler
he fills a paper cup and stands holding it
his thoughts are somewhere else
after a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into the receptacle under the cooler
he goes back to the desk
he takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on the desk
he buttons the top button of his shirt and pulls his tie right
he leaves the office with his briefcase under his arm
that was it keyes and there was no use kidding myself any more
those fates i was talking about had only been stalling me off
now they had thrown the switch
the gears had meshed
the machinery had started to move and nothing could stop it
the time for thinking had all run out
from here on it was a question of following the time table move by move just as we had it rehearsed
i wanted my time all accounted for for the rest of the afternoon and up to the last possible moment in the evening
so i arranged to call on a prospect in pasadena about a public liability bond
when i left the office i put my rate book on the desk as if i had forgotten it
that was part of the alibi
neffs coupe comes down the street and swings into the garage and goes down the ramp into the basement
i got home about seven and drove right into the garage
this was another item to establish my alibi
there are about eight cars parked
a colored attendant in coveralls and rubber boots is washing a car with a hose and sponge
neffs car comes into the shot and stops near the attendant
neff gets out with his briefcase under his arm
hiya there mr
how about a wash job on my heap charlie
how soon you want it mr
i got two cars ahead of you
anytime you get to it charlie
im staying in tonight
be all shined up for you in the morning
neff is crossing to the elevator
he speaks back over his shoulder that left front tire looks a little soft
check it will you
check em all round
neff enters the elevator
he walks straight to the phone dials and starts speaking into the mouthpiece but only the commentary is heard
up in my apartment i called lou schwartz one of the salesmen that shared my office
he lived in westwood
that made it a toll call and thered be a record of it
i told him i had forgotten my rate book and needed some dope on the public liability bond i was figuring
i asked him to call me back
this was another item in my alibi so that later on i could prove that i had been home
neff comes into the living room from the bedroom putting on the jacket of his blue suit
the phone rings
he picks up the receiver and starts talking unheard as before
he makes notes on a pad
i changed into a navy blue suit like dietrichson was going to wear
lou schwartz called me back and gave me a lot of figures
he is folding a hand towel and stuffing it into his jacket pocket
he then takes a large roll of adhesive tape and puts that into his pants pocket
contd i stuffed a hand towel and a big roll of adhesive tape into my pockets so i could fake something that looked like a cast on a broken leg
next i fixed the telephone and the doorbell so that the cards would fall down if the bells rang
that way i would know there had been a phone call or visitor while i was away
i left the apartment house by the fire stairs and side door
nobody saw me
it was already getting dark
i took the vermont avenue bus to los feliz and walked from there up to the dietrichson house
there was that smell of honeysuckle again only stronger now that it was evening
neffs hand places a small card against the bell clapper in each of these
camera pans with neff going down the stairs in his blue suit with a hat pulled down over his eyes
some windows are lit
neff comes into the shot and approaches cautiously
he looks around and then slides open the garage door
neff closes the garage door
very faint light comes in at a side window
he opens the rear door of the sedan gets in and closes the door after him
the dark interior of the car has swallowed him up
then i was in the garage
his car was backed in just the way i told phyllis to have it
it was so still i could hear the ticking of the clock on the dashboard
i kept thinking of the place we had picked out to do it that dark street on the way to the station and the three honks on the horn that
were to be the signal
about ten minutes later they came down
the front door has opened and dietrichson is half way down the steps
he is walking with crutches wearing the dark blue suit and a hat
the cast is on his left leg
there is no shoe on his left foot
only the white plaster shows
phyllis comes after him carrying his suitcase and his overcoat
she wears a camels hair coat and no hat
she catches up with him
you all right honey
ill have the car out in a second
dietrichson just grunts
she passes him to the garage camera with her and slides the door open
the camera is very low inside the sedan shooting slightly upwards from neffs hiding place
the garage door has just been opened
phyllis comes to the car opens the rear door
she looks down almost into the camera
a tight cool smile flashes across her face
then very calmly she puts the suitcase and overcoat in back on the seat out of shot
she closes the door again
dietrichson stands watching phyllis as she gets into the car and drives out to pick him up
she stops beside him and opens the right hand door
dietrichson climbs in with difficulty
she helps him watching him closely
take it easy honey
weve got lots of time
just let me do it my own way
grab that crutch
she takes one of the crutches from him
they ought to make these things so they fold up
for a moment as he leans his hand on the back of the seat there is danger that he may see neff
he slides awkwardly into the seat and pulls the second crutch in after him
he closes the door
the car moves off
phyllis driving and dietrichson beside her face towards the camera
dietrichson has a partly smoked cigar between his teeth
they are in the middle of a conversation
aw stop squawkin cant you phyllis
no man takes his wife along to a class reunion
thats what class reunions are for
tucker went along with her husband last year didnt she
yeah and what happened to her
she sat in the hotel lobby for four days straight
never even saw the guy until we poured him back on the train
his face is partly covered by the edge of a traveling rug which he has pulled up over him
he looks up at dietrichson and phyllis in the front seat
all right honey
just so long as you have a good time
i wont do much dancing i can tell you that
remember what the doctor said
if you get careless you might end up with a shorter leg
i could break the other one and match them up again
it makes you feel pretty good to get away from me doesnt it
its only for four days
ill be back monday at the latest
dont forget were having the hobeys for dinner on monday
we had them last
they owe us a dinner dont they
maybe they do but ive already asked them for monday
well i dont want to feed the hobeys
there is a look of tension in her eyes now
she glances around quickly
the car has reached the dark street neff and she picked out
and i dont want to eat at their house either
the food you get there and that rope he hands out for cigars
call it off cant you
phyllis does not answer
she doesnt even breathe
her hand goes down on the horn button
she honks three times
what are you doing that for
what the this is as far as his voice will ever get
it breaks off and dies down in a muffled groan
there are struggling noises and a dull sound of something breaking
phyllis drives on and never turns her head
she stares straight in front of her
her teeth are clenched
the station is visible about sixty yards away
there is no parking attendant
ten or twelve cars are parked diagonally not crowded
the train is not in yet but there is activity around the station
passengers and their friends redcaps and baggage men news vendors etc
the dietrichson sedan drives into the shot past camera and parks in the foreground at the outer end of the line several spaces from the next car facing away from
both front doors are open
phyllis gets out and from the other side crutches emerge and a man seen entirely from behind and apparently dietrichson climbs out awkwardly
while he is steadying himself on the ground with the crutches phyllis has taken out dietrichsons suitcase and overcoat
she walks around the car and rolls up the right front window
she closes and locks the car door
she tries the right rear door and takes a last look into the dim interior of the car
then she and the man walk slowly away from the car to the end of the station platform and along it toward the station building phyllis walks several steps ahead
of the man
camera following them a little to one side so that phyllis is clearly seen but the mans face is not
in a subdued voice you handle the redcap and the conductor
keep them away from me as much as you can
i dont want to be helped
i said dont worry walter
only at this point is it quite clear that the man is neff
you start just as soon as the train leaves
at the dairy sign you turn off the highway onto the dirt road
from there its exactly eight tenths of a mile to the dump beside the tracks
i remember everything
youll be there a little ahead of the train
you dont want any cops stopping you with him in the back
walter weve been through all that so many times
when you turn off the highway cut all your lights
im going to be back on the observation platform
ill drop off as close to the spot as i can
wait for the train to pass then blink your lights twice
they go on
over them is heard the noise of the train coming into the station and its lights are seen
the train is just coming to a stop
the passengers move forward to the tracks
phyllis carrying the suitcase and overcoat and neff still a little behind her come towards the camera
a redcap sees them and runs up
he takes the suitcase out of phyllis hand
san francisco train lady
phyllis takes an envelope containing dietrichsons ticket from the pocket of the overcoat
she reads from the envelope
car nine section eleven
just my husband going
car nine section eleven
yessum this way please
phyllis hands the overcoat to the redcap who leads her and neff towards car number nine
neff still hangs back and keeps his head down the way a man using crutches might naturally do
the pullman conductor and porter stand at the steps
the conductor is checking the tickets of passengers getting on
the redcap leads phyllis and neff into the shot
the conductor and porter see neff on his crutches and move to help him
its all right thanks
my husband doesnt like to be helped
the redcap goes up the steps into the car
neff laboriously swings himself up onto the box and from there up on the steps keeping his head down
meantime phyllis is holding the attention of the conductor and porter by showing them the ticket
car nine section eleven
the gentleman only
phyllis nods and takes the ticket back
neff has reached the top of the steps
she goes up after him and gives him the ticket
they are now close together
take awful good care of yourself with that leg
sure i will
just you take it easy going home
ill miss you honey
she kisses him
there are shouts of all aboard
the redcap comes from inside the car
section eleven suh
phyllis takes a quarter from her bag and gives it to the redcap
shouting all aboard
phyllis kisses neff again quickly
good luck honey
she runs down the steps
the porter picks up the box
he and the conductor get on board the train
phyllis stands there waving goodbye as the train starts moving and the porter begins to close the car door
phyllis turns and walks out of the shot in the direction of the parked car
neff and the porter
the conductor is going on into the car
neff is half turned away from the porter
can you make up my berth right away
im going back to the observation car for a smoke
this way sir
three cars back
he holds the vestibule door open
neff hobbles through
most of the berths are made up
as neff hobbles along another porter and some passengers make way for the crippled man solicitously
the train conductor meets neff and opens the door for him
neff hobbles on through
four or five passengers are reading or writing
as neff comes through on his crutches they pull in their feet to make room for him
one old lady seeing that he is headed for the observation platform opens the door for him
he thanks her with a nod and hobbles through
dark except for a little light coming from inside the parlor car
the train is going at about fifteen miles an hour between glendale and burbank
neff has come out and hobbled to the railing
he stands looking back along the rails
suddenly a mans voice speaks from behind him
can i pull a chair out for you
neff looks around
he sees a man sitting in the corner smoking a hand rolled cigarette
he is about fifty five years old with white hair and a broad brimmed stetson hat
he looks like a small town lawyer or maybe a mining man
neff does not like the mans presence there very much
he turns to him just enough to answer
no thanks id rather stand
you going far
my names jackson
im going all the way to medford
had a broken arm myself once
that darn cast sure itches something fierce dont it
i thought id go crazy with mine
neff stands silent
his mind is feverishly thinking of how to get rid of jackson
palo altos a nice little town
you a stanford man
used to be
he starts patting his pockets as if looking for something
i bet you left something behind
i always do
my cigar case
must have left it in my overcoat back in the section
jackson takes out a small bag of tobacco and a packet of cigarette papers
care to roll yourself a cigarette mr
i really prefer cigars
looking around maybe the porter i could get your cigars for you
be glad to mr
thats darn nice of you
its car nine section eleven
if youre sure its not too much trouble
car nine section eleven
he rises and exits into the parlor car
neff turns slowly and watches jackson go back through the car
then he moves to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track to orientate himself
he gives one last glance back into the parlor car to make sure no one is watching him
he slips the crutches from under his arms and stands on both feet
he drops the crutches off the train onto the tracks then quickly swings his body over the rail
neff is hanging onto the railing
he looks down then lets go and drops to the right of way
the camera stops
the train recedes slowly into the night
neff has fallen on the tracks
he picks himself up rubs one knee and looks back along the line of the tracks and off to one side
close beyond the edge of the right of way the silhouette of a dump shows up
beside it looms the dark bulk of the dietrichson sedan
the headlights blink twice and go out
he starts running towards the car
he runs a little awkwardly because of the improvised cast on his left foot
the front door opens and phyllis steps out
she closes the door and looks in the direction of the tracks
the uneven steps of neff running towards her are heard
she opens the back door of the car and leans in
she pulls the rug off the corpse which is not visible and stands looking into the car unable to take her eyes off what she sees while at the same
time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug
the running steps grow louder and neff comes into the shot breathing hard
he reaches her
this has to go fast
take his hat and pick up the crutches
neff points back towards the tracks
he reaches into the car and begins to drag out the body by the armpits
phyllis coolly reaches past him and takes the hat off the dead mans head
she turns to go
hang on to that rug
ill need it
phyllis moves out of the shot carrying the hat and rug
he gets a stronger hold on the dead dietrichson and drags him free of the car and towards the tracks
the corpse is not seen
she has reached the point where one of the crutches lies
she picks it up and goes for the other crutch a short distance away
she carries both crutches the hat and the rug towards neff
he has reached the railroad tracks
the corpse is lying beside the tracks face down
phyllis comes up to neff
he takes the crutches and the hat from her
he throws the crutches beside the corpse
he takes the hat from phyllis and tosses it carelessly along the track
stay behind me
he takes the rug from her and they move back towards the car phyllis first then neff walking almost backwards sweeping the ground over which the body was dragged with
the rug as they go
they reach it together
she gets in
neff sweeps the ground after him as he goes around the car to get in beside her
he throws the rug into the back of the car
phyllis is behind the wheel
neff beside her is just closing the door
he props his wrapped foot against the dashboard and begins to tear off the adhesive tape while at the same time phyllis presses the starter button
the starter grinds but the motor doesnt catch
she tries again
it still doesnt catch
neff looks at her
she tries a third time
the starter barely turns over
the battery is very low
phyllis leans back
they stare at each other desperately
after a moment neff bends forward slowly and turns the ignition key to the off position
he holds his left thumb poised over the starter button
there is a breathless moment
then he presses the starter button with swift decision
the starter grinds with nerve wracking sluggishness
neff twists the ignition key to on and instantly pulls the hand throttle wide open
with a last feeble kick of the starter the motor catches and races
he eases the throttle down and slides back into his place
they look at each other again
the tenseness of the moment still shows in their faces
lets go baby
phyllis releases the hand brake and puts the car in reverse
neff is again busy unwrapping the tape from his leg
the car moves
the car with the headlights out backs up swings around and moves off along the dirt road the way it came
phyllis and neff facing towards camera
neff is bent over peeling the towel and plaster off his foot which is out of shot
phyllis is calm almost relaxed
neff straightens up
they are talking to each other
their lips are seen moving but what they say is not heard
they stop talking
phyllis stares straight ahead
neff is pulling adhesive tape off the wrapped towel that was on his foot
he folds the adhesive into a tight ball rolls the towel up puts both into his pockets
on the way back we went over once more what she was to do at the inquest if they had one and about the insurance when that came up
i was afraid she might go to pieces a little now that we had done it but she was perfect
not a tear not even a blink of the eyes
the sedan drives into the shot and stops without pulling over to the curb
contd she dropped me a block from my apartment house
the car door opens
neff starts to get out
neff turns back to her
whats the matter walter
arent you going to kiss me
sure im going to kiss you
phyllis bends towards him and puts her arms around him
its straight down the line isnt it
phyllis kisses him
in the kiss he is passive
i love you walter
i love you baby
neff going up
it was two minutes past eleven as i went up the fire stairs again
nobody saw me this time either
telephone bell box and the door bell
the cards are still in position
neffs hand takes them out
contd in the apartment i checked the bells
the cards hadnt moved
neff comes from the bedroom wearing the light grey suit he wore before the murder only with out a tie
he buttons his jacket looks around the room and opens the corridor door
i changed the blue suit
there was one last thing to do
i wanted the garage man to see me again
fifteen or twenty cars are parked now
charlie the attendant has washed neffs car and is now polishing the glass and metal work
neff comes from the elevator
charlie sees him
he straightens up
you going to need it after all mr
im about through
its okay charlie
just walking down to the drug store for something to eat
been working upstairs all evening
my stomachs getting sore at me
he walks up the ramp towards the garage entrance
neff comes out at the top of the ramp and starts to walk down the street not too fast
camera precedes him
he walks about ten or fifteen yards
at first his steps sound hard and distinct on the sidewalk and echo in the deserted street
but slowly as he goes on they fade into utter silence
he walks a few feet without sound then becomes aware of the silence
he stops rigidly and looks back
camera stops with him
he stands like that for a moment then turns toward the camera again
there is a look of horror on his face now
he walks on camera ahead of him again
still his steps make no sound
that was all there was to it
nothing had slipped nothing had been overlooked there was nothing to give us away
and yet keyes as i was walking down the street to the drug store suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong
it sounds crazy keyes but its true so help me i couldnt hear my own footsteps
it was the walk of a dead man
neff sits before the dictaphone
there are four cylinders on end on the desk next to him
he gets up from the swivel chair with great effort and stands a moment unsteadily
the wound in his shoulder is paining him
he is very weak as he slowly crosses to the water cooler
he takes the blood stained handkerchief from inside his shirt and soaks it with fresh water
the office door opens behind him
he turns hiding the handkerchief behind his back
in the doorway stands the colored man who has been cleaning up downstairs
he is carrying his big trash box by a rope handle
didnt know anybody was here mr
we aint cleaned your office yet
let it go tonight
whatever you say mr
he closes the door slowly staring at neff with an uneasy expression
neff puts the soaked handkerchief back on his wounded shoulder then walks heavily over to his swivel chair and lowers himself into it
he takes the dictaphone horn and speaks into it again
that was the longest night i ever lived through keyes and the next day was worse when the story broke in the papers and they were talking about it at
the office and the day after that when you started digging into it
i kept my hands in my pockets because i thought they were shaking and i put on dark glasses so people couldnt see my eyes and then i took them
off again so people wouldnt get to wondering why i wore them
i was trying to hold myself together but i could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces
neff comes through the reception room doors with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm
he walks towards his office but half way there he runs into keyes
keyes is wearing his vest and hat no coat
he is carrying a file of papers and smoking a cigar
come on walter
the big boss wants to see us
he turns and walks beside keyes camera ahead of them that dietrichson case
the guys dead we had him insured and its going to cost us money
thats always wrong
he stops by a majolica jar full of sand and takes a pencil from his vest
he stands over the jar extinguishing his cigar carefully so as not to damage it
what have you got so far
no heart failure no apoplexy no predisposing medical cause of any kind
he died of a broken neck
when is the inquest
they had it this morning
his wife and daughter made the identification
the train people and some passengers told how he went through to the observation car
it was all over in forty five minutes
verdict accidental death
keyes puts the half smoked cigar into his vest pocket with the pencil
they move on
what do the police figure
that he got tangled up in his crutches and fell off the train
its not their dough
they stop at a door lettered in embossed chromium letters edward s
keyes opens the door
they go in
a secretary sitting behind a desk
as keyes and neff enter the door to nortons private office is opened
from inside mr
norton is letting out three legal looking gentlemen
norton is about forty five very well groomed rather pompous in manner
to the men who are leaving i believe the legal position is now clear gentlemen
please stand by
i may need you later
he sees keyes and neff
come in mr
you too mr
neff has put down his hat and briefcase
he and keyes pass the legal looking men and follow norton into his office
naturally it is the best office in the building modern but not modernistic spacious very well furnished flowers smoking stands easy chairs etc
norton has gone behind his desk
keyes has come in and neff after him closes the door quietly
norton looks disapprovingly at keyes shirt sleeves
you find this an uncomfortably warm day mr
keyes takes his hat off but holds it in his hands
i didnt know this was formal
norton smiles frostily
sit down gentlemen
to keyes any new developments
keyes and neff sit down norton remains standing
i just talked to this jackson long distance
up in medford oregon
the last guy that saw dietrichson alive
they were out on the observation platform together talking
dietrichson wanted a cigar and jackson went to get dietrichsons cigar case for him
when he came back to the observation platform no dietrichson
jackson didnt think anything was wrong until a wire caught up with the train at santa barbara
they had found dietrichsons body on the tracks near burbank
very interesting about the cigar case
he walks up and down behind his desk thinking hard
dietrichsons secretary says she didnt know anything about the policy
there is a daughter but all she remembers is neff talking to her father about accident insurance at their house one night
i couldnt sell him at first
dietrichson opposed it
he told me hed think it over
later on i went down to the oil fields and closed him
he signed the application and gave me his check
dripping with sarcasm a fine piece of salesmanship that was mr
theres no sense in pushing neff around
hes got the best sales record in the office
are your salesmen supposed to know that the customer is going to fall off a train
fall off a train
are we sure dietrichson fell off the train
there is a charged pause
i dont get it
you dont mr
then what do you think of this case
this policy might cost us a great deal of money
as you know it contains a double indemnity clause
just what is your opinion
no opinion at all
not even a hunch
one of those interesting little hunches of yours
not even a hunch
im surprised mr
ive formed a very definite opinion
i think i know in fact i know i know what happened to dietrichson
you know you know what
i know it was not an accident
he looks from keyes to neff and back to keyes
what do you say to that
youve got the ball
lets see you run with it
theres a widespread feeling that just because a man has a large office the dictograph on his desk buzzes
he reaches over and depresses a key and puts the earpiece to his ear
into dictograph yes
have her come in please
he replaces the earpiece
he turns back to keyes and neff
that just because a man has a large office he must be an idiot
im having a visitor if you dont mind
keyes and neff start to get up
i want you to stay and watch me handle this
the secretary has opened the door
neff stands staring at the door
he relaxes with an obvious effort of will
phyllis comes in
she wears a gray tailored suit small black hat with a veil black gloves and carries a black bag
the secretary closes the door behind her
norton goes to meet her
thank you very much for coming mrs
i assure you i appreciate it
he turns a little towards keyes
this is mr
how do you do
how do you do
ive met mr
how do you do
norton has placed a chair
norton goes behind his desk
dietrichson i assure you of our sympathy in your bereavement
i hesitated before asking you to come here so soon after your loss
phyllis nods silently
but now that youre here i hope you wont mind if i plunge straight into business
you know why we asked you to come dont you
all i know is that your secretary made it sound very urgent
keyes sits quietly in his chair with his legs crossed
he has hung his hat on his foot and thrust his thumbs in the armholes of his vest
he looks a little bored
neff behind him stands leaning against the false mantel completely dead pan
your husband had an accident policy with this company
evidently you dont know that mrs
i remember some talk at the house she looks towards neff
but he didnt seem to want it
he took it out a few days later mrs
youll probably find the policy among his personal effects
his safe deposit box hasnt been opened yet
it seems a tax examiner has to be present
dietrichson i dont want you to think you are being subjected to any questioning
but there are a few things we should like to know
what sort of things
we have the report of the coroners inquest
we are not entirely satisfied
in fact we are not satisfied at all
phyllis looks at him coolly
keyes looks vaguely interested
neff is staring straight at phyllis
dietrichson we suspect suicide
phyllis doesnt bat an eyelash
would you like a glass of water
he indicates a thermos on a stand near neff
neff pours a glass of water and carries it over to phyllis
she has lifted her veil a little
she takes the glass from his hand
their eyes meet for a fraction of a second
had your husband been moody or depressed lately mrs
did he seem to have financial worries for instance
he was perfectly all right and i dont know of any financial worries
there must have been something mrs
let us examine this so called accident
first your husband takes out this policy in absolute secrecy
because he doesnt want his family to suspect what he intends to do
next he goes on this trip entirely alone
he has to be alone
he hobbles all the way out to the observation platform very unlikely with his leg in a cast unless he has a very strong reason
once there he finds he is not alone
there is a man there
what was his name keyes
norton flips his fingers impatiently at keyes who doesnt even bother to look up
his name was jackson
probably still is
so your husband gets rid of this jackson with some flimsy excuse about cigars
and then he is alone
and then he does it
in which case the company is not liable
pause you know that of course
we could go to court i dont know anything
in fact i dont know why i came here
she makes as if to rise indignantly
just a moment please
i said we could go to court
i didnt say we want to
not only is it against our practice but it would involve a great deal of expense a lot of lawyers a lot of time perhaps years
phyllis rises coldly
so what i want to suggest is a compromise on both sides
a settlement for a certain sum a part of the policy value dont bother mr
when i came in here i had no idea you owed me any money
you told me you did
then you told me you didnt
now you tell me you want to pay me a part of it whatever it is
you want to bargain with me at a time like this
i dont like your insinuations about my husband mr
norton and i dont like your methods
in fact i dont like you mr
she turns and walks out
the door closes after her
there is a pregnant pause
keyes straightens up in his chair
nice going mr
you sure carried that ball
norton pours himself a glass of water and stands holding it
only you fumbled on the goal line
then you heaved an illegal forward pass and got thrown for a forty yard loss
now you cant pick yourself up because you havent got a leg to stand on
i havent eh
let her claim
let her sue
we can prove it was suicide
keyes stands up
norton the first thing that hit me was that suicide angle
only i dropped it in the wastepaper basket just three seconds later
you ought to take a look at the statistics on suicide sometime
you might learn a little something about the insurance business
i was raised in the insurance business mr
in the front office
come on you never read an actuarial table in your life
ive got ten volumes on suicide alone
suicide by race by color by occupation by sex by seasons of the year by time of day
suicide how committed by poisons by fire arms by drowning by leaps
suicide by poison subdivided by types of poison such as corrosive irritant systemic gaseous narcotic alkaloid protein and so forth
suicide by leaps subdivided by leaps from high places under wheels of trains under wheels of trucks under the feet of horses from steamboats
norton of all the cases on record theres not one single case of suicide by leap from the rear end of a moving train
and do you know how fast that train was going at the point where the body was found
fifteen miles an hour
now how could anybody jump off a slow moving train like that with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself
no soap mr
were sunk and were going to pay through the nose and you know it
may i have this
keyes throat is dry after the long speech
he grabs the glass of water out of nortons hand and drains it in one big gulp
norton is watching him almost stupefied
neff stands with the shadow of a smile on his face
keyes puts the glass down noisily on nortons desk
come on walter
norton doesnt move or speak
keyes puts his hat on and crosses towards the door neff after him
with the doorknob in his hand keyes turns back to norton with a glance down at his own shirt sleeves
next time ill rent a tuxedo
they go out
there is a tired grin on his face as he talks into the horn
i could have hugged you right then and there keyes you and your statistics
you were the only one we were really scared of and instead you were almost playing on our team
the corridor door opens letting light in
neff enters with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm
he switches the lights on closes the door puts the lights on closes the door puts the key in his pocket
at this moment the telephone rings
he picks up the phone
that evening when i got home my nerves had eased off
i could feel the ground under my feet again and it looked like easy going from there on it
sure everything is fine
you were wonderful in nortons office
phyllis is on the phone
she is not dressed as in nortons office
i felt so funny
i wanted to look at you all the time
how do you think i felt
where are you baby
at the drug store
just a block away
can i come up
but be careful
dont let anybody see you
he hangs up takes off his hat and drops hat and briefcase on the davenport
he looks around the room and crosses to lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains
he gathers up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor and puts it in the waste paper basket
the door bell rings
neff stops in sudden alarm
it cant be phyllis
the time is too short
for a second he stands there motionless then crosses to the door and opens it
in the open door stands keyes
keyes walks past him into the room
his hands are clasped behind his back
there is a strange absent minded look in his eyes
neff closes the door without taking his eyes off keyes
whats on your mind
keyes stops in the middle of the room and turns
that broken leg
the guy broke his leg
what are you talking about
talking about dietrichson
he had accident insurance didnt he
then he broke his leg didnt he
and he didnt put in a claim
why didnt he put in a claim
what the dickens are you driving at
theres something wrong
i ate dinner two hours ago
it stuck half way
he prods his stomach with his thumb
the little man is acting up again
because theres something wrong with that dietrichson case
because he didnt put in a claim
maybe he just didnt have time
oh maybe he just didnt know he was insured
he has stopped in front of neff
they look at each other for a tense moment
neff hardly breathes
keyes shakes his head suddenly
that couldnt be it
you delivered the policy to him personally didnt you walter
and you got his check
stiff lipped but his voice is as well under control as he can manage sure i did
keyes prods his stomach again
got any bicarbonate of soda
no i havent
keyes resumes his pacing
ive been living with this little man for twenty six years
hes never failed me yet
theres got to be something wrong
maybe norton was right
maybe it was suicide keyes
pause but not accident either
there is another longer pause agonizing for neff
finally keyes continues look
a man takes out an accident policy that is worth a hundred thousand dollars if he is killed on a train
then two weeks later he is killed on a train
and not in a train accident mind you but falling off some silly observation car
do you know what the mathematical probability of that is walter
one out of i dont know how many billions
and add to that the broken leg
it just cant be the way it looks walter
something has been worked on us
such as what
keyes doesnt answer
he goes on pacing up and down
finally neff cant stand the silence any longer
prods stomach again dont you have any peppermint or anything
pause who do you suspect
maybe i like to make things easy for myself
but i always tend to suspect the beneficiary
that wide eyed dame that didnt know anything about anything
youre crazy keyes
she wasnt even on the train
i know she wasnt walter
i dont claim to know how it was worked or who worked it but i know that it was worked
he crosses to the corridor door
ive got to get to a drug store
it feels like a hunk of concrete inside me
he puts his hand on the knob to open the door
the hallway is empty except for phyllis who has been standing close to the door of neffs apartment listening
the door has just started to open
phyllis moves away quickly and flattens herself against the wall behind the opening door
keyes is coming out
good night walter
neff behind him looks anxiously down the hallway for phyllis
suddenly his eye catches a glimpse of her through the crack of the partly opened door
he pushes the door wide so as to hide her from keyes
good night keyes
see you at the office in the morning
he has reached the elevator
he pushes the call button and turns
but id like to move in on her right now tonight if it wasnt for norton and his stripe pants ideas about company policy
id have the cops after her so quick her head would spin
theyd put her through the wringer and brother what they would squeeze out
only you havent got a single thing to go on keyes
the elevator has come up and stopped
not too much
twenty six years experience all the percentage there is and this lump of concrete in my stomach
he pulls back the elevator door and turns to neff with one last glance of annoyance
almost angrily no bicarbonate of soda
keyes gets into the elevator
the door closes
the elevator goes down
neff stands numb looking at the spot where keyes was last visible
without moving his eyes he pulls the door around towards him with his left hand
phyllis slowly comes out
neff motions quickly to her to go into the apartment
she crosses in front of him and enters
he steps in backwards after her
phyllis has come a few steps into the room
neff backing in after her closes the door from inside and turns slowly
they look at each other for a long moment in complete silence
how much does he know
its not what he knows
its those stinking hunches of his
but he cant prove anything can he
not if were careful
not if we dont see each other for a while
for how long a while
she moves toward him but he does not respond
until all this dies down
you dont know keyes the way i do
once he gets his teeth into something he wont let go
hell investigate you
hell have you shadowed
hell watch you every minute from now on
are you afraid baby
yes im afraid
but not of keyes
im afraid of us
were not the same any more
we did it so we could be together but instead of that its pulling us apart
isnt it walter
what are you talking about
and you dont really care whether we see each other or not
shut up baby
he pulls her close and kisses her
two telephone operators and a receptionist are at work
several visitors are waiting in chairs
lola dietrichson is one of them
shes wearing a simple black suit and hat indicating mourning
her fingers nervously pick at a handkerchief and her eyes are watching the elevator doors anxiously
now and then the telephone operators in the background are heard saying pacific all risk
the elevator comes up and the doors open
several people come out among them neff carrying his briefcase
lola sees him and stands up and as he is about to pass through the anteroom without recognizing her she stops him
neff looks at her a little startled
his voice hangs in the air
dont you remember me
on his guard yes
could i talk to you just for a few minutes
somewhere where we can be alone
come on into my office
he pushes the swing door open and holds it for her
as she passes in front of him his eyes narrow in uneasy speculation
neff comes up level with lola and leads her towards his office camera with them
is it something to do with what happened
its about my fathers death
im terribly sorry miss dietrichson
he opens the door of his office and holds it for her
lou schwartz one of the other salesmen is working at his desk
lola enters neff after her
to schwartz lou do you mind if i use the office alone for a few minutes
its all yours walter
he gets up and goes out
lola has walked over to the window and is looking out so schwartz wont stare at her
neff places a chair beside his desk
wont you sit down
at the sound of the closing door she turns and speaks with a catch in her voice
neff i cant help it but i have such a strange feeling that there is something queer about my fathers death
queer in what way
i dont know why i should be bothering you with my troubles except that you knew my father and knew about the insurance he took out
and you were so nice to me that evening in your car
we got along fine didnt we
he sits down
his face is grim and watchful
look at me mr
im not crazy
im not hysterical
im not even crying
but i have the awful feeling that something is wrong and i had the same feeling once before when my mother died
when your mother died
we were up at lake arrowhead
that was six years ago
we had a cabin there
it was winter and very cold and my mother was very sick with pneumonia
she had a nurse with her
there were just the three of us in the cabin
one night i got up and went into my mothers room
she was delirious with fever
all the bed covers were on the floor and the windows were wide open
the nurse wasnt in the room
i ran and covered my mother up as quickly as i could
just then i heard a door open behind me
the nurse stood there
she didnt say a word but there was a look in her eyes ill never forget
two days later my mother was dead
pause do you know who that nurse was
neff stares at her tensely
he knows only too well who the nurse was
i tried to tell my father but i was just a kid then and he wouldnt listen to me
six months later she married him and i kind of talked myself out of the idea that she could have done anything like that
but now its all back again now that something has happened to my father too
youre not making sense miss dietrichson
your father fell off a train
yes and two days before he fell off that train what was phyllis doing
she was in her room in front of a mirror with a black hat on and she was pinning a black veil to it as if she couldnt wait to
see how she would look in mourning
youve had a pretty bad shock
arent you just imagining all this
i caught her eyes in the mirror and they had that look in them they had before my mother died
that same look
you dont like your step mother do you
isnt it just because she is your step mother
i loathe her
because she did it
she did it for the money
only youre not going to pay her are you mr
shes not going to get away with it this time
im going to speak up
im going to tell everything i know
youd better be careful saying things like that
im not afraid
she turns again to the window so he wont see that she is crying
neff gets up and goes to her
i didnt mean to act like this
all this that youve been telling me who else have you told
how about your step mother
of course not
im not living in the house any more
i moved out
and you didnt tell that boy friend of yours
im not seeing him any more
we had a fight
where are you living then
i got myself a little apartment in hollywood
four walls and you just sit and look at them huh
she turns from the window with a pathetic little nod
through her tears yes mr
in the foreground neff and lola are having dinner
in the background the usual activity of olvera street sidewalk peddlers guitar players etc
so i took her to dinner that evening at a mexican joint down on olvera street where nobody would see us
i wanted to cheer her up
neff and lola driving along the beach near santa monica
neff is wearing a light summer suit very much in contrast to lolas mourning
apparently she is telling him a story and now and then she laughs but there is no sound
camera moves past her to a close shot of neff behind the steering wheel
he is only half listening to lola
his mind is full of other thoughts
next day was sunday and we went for a ride down to the beach
she had loosened up a bit and she was even laughing
i had to make sure she wouldnt tell that stuff about phyllis to anybody else
it was dynamite whether it was true or not
and i had no chance to talk to phyllis
you were watching her like a hawk keyes
i couldnt even phone her for fear you had the wires tapped
neff with his hat on and no briefcase is walking toward keyes office
as he comes up close to the door he stops with a startled expression on his face
on a chair beside the door sits a familiar figure
he is jackson the man from the observation platform of the train
he is wearing his stetson hat and smoking a cigar
he is studying something in the file folder
neff recognizes him immediately but jackson does not look up
neff controls his expression and goes on to open the door to keyes office
monday morning there was a note on my desk that you wanted to see me keyes
for a minute i wondered if it could be about lola
it was worse
outside your door was the last guy in the world i wanted to see
neff is just closing the door from the inside
keyes his coat off is lying on his office couch chewing on a cigar as usual
come in walter
i want to ask you something
after all the years weve known each other do you mind if i make a rather blunt statement
walter im a very great man
this dietrichson business
its murder and murders dont come any neater
as fancy a piece of homicide as anybody ever ran into
smart and tricky and almost perfect but keyes bounces off the couch like a rubber ball
but i think papa has it all figured out figured out and wrapped up in tissue paper with pink ribbons on it
keyes levels a finger at him
you know what
that guy dietrichson was never on the train
no he wasnt walter
look you cant be sure of killing a man by throwing him off a train thats going fifteen miles an hour
the only way you can be sure is to kill him first and then throw his body on the tracks
that would mean either killing him on the train or and this is where it really gets fancy you kill him somewhere else and put him on the tracks
two possibilities and i personally buy the second
youre way ahead of me keyes
look it was like this
they killed the guy the wife and somebody else and then the somebody else took the crutches and went on the train as dietrichson and then the somebody else jumped
off and then they put the body on the tracks where the train had passed
an impersonation see
and a cinch to work
because it was night very few people were about they had the crutches to stare at and they never really looked at the man at all
its fancy all right keyes
maybe its a little too fancy
i tell you it fits together like a watch
and now lets see what we have in the way of proof
the only guy that really got a good look at this supposed dietrichson is sitting right outside my office
i took the trouble to bring him down here from oregon
lets see what he has to say
keyes goes to the door and opens it
come in mr
jackson enters with the file folder
yes sir mr
these are fine cigars you smoke
he indicates the cigar he himself is smoking
two for a quarter
thats what i said
never mind the cigar jackson
did you study those photographs
what do you say
yes indeed i studied them thoroughly
very thoroughly well
did you make up your mind
keyes im a medford man
up in medford we take our time making up our minds well youre not in medford now
im in a hurry
lets have it
jackson indicates the file folder he is holding
are these photographs of the late mr
then my answer is no
what do you mean no
i mean this is not the man that was on the train
will you swear to that
im a medford man
and if i say it i mean it and if i mean it of course ill swear it
keyes turns to neff
there you are walter
theres your proof
keyes remembers he forgot to introduce jackson
jackson this is mr
neff one of our salesmen
please to meet you mr
how do you do
very fine thank you
never was better
jackson how would you describe the man you saw on that observation platform
well im pretty sure he was a younger man about ten or fifteen years younger than the man in these photographs
dietrichson was about fifty wasnt he walter
fifty one according to the policy
the man i saw was nothing like fifty one years old
of course it was pretty dark on that platform and come to think of it he tried to keep his back towards me
but im positive just the same
thats fine jackson
now you understand this matter is strictly confidential
we may need you again down here in los angeles if the case comes to court
any time you need me im at your entire disposal gentlemen
expenses paid of course
keyes picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks into it
get me lubin in the cashiers office
meanwhile jackson crosses over to neff and during the ensuing dialogue between him and neff we hear keyes low voice on the phone in background
we do not hear what he says
to neff ever been in medford mr
wait a minute
do you go trout fishing
maybe i saw you up klamath falls way
ive got it
its the name
theres a family of neffs in corvallis
let me see
this mans an automobile dealer in corvallis
very reputable man too im told
keyes rejoins them at this point
all right mr
suppose you go down to the cashiers office room twenty seven on the eleventh floor
theyll take care of your expense account and your ticket for the train tonight
tomorrow morning would suit me better
theres a very good osteopath down here i want to see before i leave
keyes has opened the door for jackson
just dont put her on the expense account
jackson doesnt get it
he goes out
there it is walter
its beginning to come apart at the seams already
a murders never perfect
it always comes apart sooner or later
and when two people are involved its usually sooner
we know the dietrichson dame is in it and somebody else
pretty soon were going to know who that somebody else is
hes got to show
sometime somewhere theyve got to meet
their emotions are all kicked up
whether its love or hate doesnt matter
they cant keep away from each other
they think its twice as safe because there are two of them
but its not twice as safe
its ten times twice as dangerous
theyve committed a murder and thats not like taking a trolley ride together where each one can get off at a different stop
theyre stuck with each other
theyve got to ride all the way to the end of the line
and its a one way trip and the last stop is the cemetery
he puts a cigar in his mouth and starts tapping his pockets for matches
continued she put in her claim and im going to throw it right back at her
pats his pockets again have you got one of those
neff strikes a match for him
keyes takes the match out of his hand and lights his cigar
let her sue us if she dares
ill be ready for her and that somebody else
theyll be digging their own graves
neff is in the booth dialing a number and as she waits he looks around to make sure he is not watched
into phone mrs
this is jerrys market
we just got in a shipment of that english soap you were asking about
will you be coming by this morning
thank you mrs
neff hangs up
the lasalle stops in front of the market
phyllis steps out and goes into the market looking around
neff is moving slowly along the shelves outwardly calm but with his nerves on edge
from beyond him phyllis approaches
she stops beside him facing the same way with a couple of feet separating them
in a harsh whisper come closer
phyllis moves close to him
whats the matter
everythings the matter
keyes is rejecting your claim
hes sitting back with his mouth watering waiting for you to sue
he wants you to sue
but youre not going to
whats he got to stop me
hes got the goods
hes figured out how it was worked
he knows it was somebody else on the train
hes dug up a witness he thinks will prove it
prove it how
listen if he rejects that claim i have to sue
and then youre in court and a lot of other things are going to come up
like for instance about you and the first mrs
phyllis looks at him sharply sideways
what about me and the first mrs
the way she died
and about that black hat you were trying on before you needed a black hat
a customer comes along the aisle toward them
they move apart
the customer passes
phyllis draws close again
walter lolas been telling you some of her cockeyed stories
shes been seeing you
ive been seeing her if you want to know
so she wont yell her head off about what she knows
yes shes been putting on an act for you crying all over your shoulder that lying little keep her out of it
all im telling you is were not going to sue
because you dont want the money any more even if you could get it
because shes made you feel like a heel all of sudden
it isnt the money any more
its our necks now
were pulling out understand
because of what keyes can do
youre not fooling me walter
its because of lola
what you did to her father
you cant take it that she might find out some day
i said leave her out of it
walter its me im talking about
i dont want to be left out of it
stop saying that
its just that it hasnt worked out the way we wanted
we cant have the money
we cant go through with it thats all
we have gone through with it walter
the tough part is all behind us
we just have to hold on now and not go soft inside and stick together close the way we started out
phyllis takes his arm forgetting where she is
he pulls away
watch it will you
one of the market help pushing a small hand truck loaded with packaged goods comes along the aisle
he stops and begins to restock a shelf very close to neff and phyllis
they go off slowly in opposite directions
camera pans with neff as he walks toward another shelf one that stands away from the wall
phyllis appears on the opposite side of the shelf and stops facing toward him
they now continue their low voiced dialogue through the piled up merchandise
i loved you walter
and i hated him
but i wasnt going to do anything about it not until i met you
it was you had the plan
i only wanted him dead
yeah and i was the one that fixed him so he was dead
is that what youre telling me
phyllis takes off her dark glasses for the first time and looks at him with cold hard eyes
and nobodys pulling out
we went into it together and were coming out at the end together
its straight down the line for both of us remember
phyllis puts the glasses on again and goes
over neffs face as he looks after her comes the commentary
i remembered all right
just as i remembered what you had told me keyes about that trolley car ride and how there was no way to get off until the end of the line
neff is dictating into the dictaphone
yeah i remembered it all right
just as i remembered what you had told me keyes about that trolley car ride and how there was no way to get off until the end of the line
where the cemetery was
and i got to thinking what cemeteries are for
theyre to put dead people in i guess that was the first time i ever thought about phyllis that way
dead i mean and how things would be if she was dead
because the way it was now she had me by the throat
she could hang me higher than a kite any day she felt like it
and there was nothing i could do except hold my breath and watch that day come closer and closer and maybe pray a little if i still knew how to
i saw lola three or four times that week
i guess it sounds crazy keyes after what i had done but it was only with her that i could relax and let go a little
then one night we drove up into the hills above hollywood bowl
neff and lola are climbing over a low hill in the foreground
the sky is starlit and music from the bowl comes over the scene from below cesar franck d minor symphony
as he helps her climb up camera pans with them and shows the expanse of the bowl below a packed audience and the orchestra on the lighted shell
they sit down on the grass
neff sits near her not too close
it is very dark and they are silhouetted against the shell lights
neff puts a cigarette in his mouth and strikes a match
the flame lights up lolas face
neff glances at her
she is crying
he lights his cigarette and blows out the match
a pause follows
why are you crying
lola doesnt answer
you wont tell me
in a choked voice of course i will walter
i wouldnt tell anybody else but you
its about nino
what about him
they killed my father together
he and phyllis
he helped her do it
i know he did
what makes you say that
ive been following him
hes at her house night after night
it was phyllis and him all the time
maybe he was going with me just for a blind
and the night of the murder you promised not to talk that way any more
he was supposed to pick me up after a lecture at u
but he never showed up
he said he was sick
he couldnt show up because the train was leaving with my father on it
she begins to cry again
maybe im just crazy
maybe its all just in my mind
sure its all in your mind
i only wish it was walter because i still love him
over neffs face as he listens to the music comes the commentary
phyllis and zachetti
what was he doing up at her house
i couldnt figure that one out i tried to make sense out of it and got nowhere
but the real brain twister came the next day
you sprang it on me keyes after office hours when you caught me down in the lobby of the building
or a little later
a stream of office employees is coming out of an elevator a second elevator reaches the lobby and some more office employees come out among them neff wearing his hat
and carrying his briefcase
camera precedes him as he walks toward the entrance doors
he is stopped by keyes voice off to one side
oh walter just a minute
neff stops and looks towards the cigar counter as he moves towards him
keyes is standing there buying cigars
he is stuffing them into his pockets
hang onto your hat walter
the dietrichson case just busted wide open
how do you mean
the guy showed
the somebody else
the guy that did it with her
shes filed suit against us and its okay by me
when we get into that courtroom ill tear them apart both of them
come on ill buy you a martini
no thanks keyes
with two olives
ive got to get a shave and a shoeshine
ive got a date
i still bet she drinks from the bottle
he bites off the end of the cigar and puts the cigar into his mouth
he starts tapping his pockets for a match as usual
neff strikes a match for him
they give you matches when they sell you cigars keyes
all you have to do is ask for them
i dont like them
they always explode in my pockets
so long walter
keyes goes toward the street and out of scene
neff moves back into the lobby camera following him
as he reaches the elevator he looks back over his shoulder to make sure keyes is gone then steps into the empty elevator
you sure had me worried keyes
i didnt know if you were playing cat and mouse with me whether you knew all along i was the somebody else
thats what i had to find out and i thought i knew where to look
to elevator operator twelve
neff comes out of the elevator
the receptionist is just tidying up her desk
she has her hat on and is preparing to leave
neff passes on through the swinging doors to the twelfth floor balcony
upstairs the last of the people were just leaving
neff enters from the reception room
a couple of belated employees are leaving for the day
neff goes toward keyes office looks around to make sure he is unobserved enters
i made sure nobody saw me go into your office
neff has just come in
he goes over to keyes desk and searches the papers on it
he tries the desk drawers and finds them locked
his eye falls on the dictaphone on the stand beside the desk
a record is on it the needle is about two thirds of the way towards the end
he lifts the needle and sets it back to the beginning of the record sets the switch to playback position
he lifts the arm off the bracket and starts the machine
keyes voice is heard coming from the horn from dictaphone memo to mr
with regard to your proposal to put walter neff under surveillance i disagree absolutely
i have investigated his movements on the night of the crime and he is definitely placed in his apartment from p
in addition to this i have known neff intimately for eleven years and i personally vouch for him without reservation
neff stops the machine
he sits down slowly still holding the horn
he is deeply moved
after a moment he presses the switch again
from dictaphone furthermore no connection whatsoever has been established between walter neff and mrs
phyllis dietrichson whereas i am now able to report that such a connection has been established between her and another man
this man has been observed to visit the dietrichson home on the night of july th th th th and th
we have succeeded in identifying him as one nino zachetti former medical student aged twenty eight residing at lilac court apartments n
la brea avenue
we have checked zachettis movements on the night of the crime and have found that they cannot be accounted for
i am preparing a more detailed report for your consideration and it is my belief that we already have sufficient evidence against zachetti and mrs
dietrichson to justify police action
i strongly urge that this whole matter be turned over to the office of the district attorney
respectfully barton keyes
neff sits staring blankly at the wall
the cylinder goes on revolving but no more voice comes only the whir of the needle on the empty record
at last he remembers to replace the horn
he hangs it back on its hook
the machine stops
neff gets up from the chair walks slowly to the door and goes out
neff has just come out of keyes office
he walks slowly back towards the reception room entrance then stands there looking out through the glass doors
all the employees have now left
neff is entirely alone
he moves as if to go out then stops rigidly as his face lights up with excitement of a sudden idea
he turns quickly and walks on to his own office and enters
neff walks across to his desk lifts the telephone and dials a number
during the ensuing telephone conversation only what he says is heard
the pauses indicate speeches at the other end of the line
ive got to see you
yes it has to be tonight
hows eleven oclock
dont worry about keyes
leave the door on the latch and put the lights out
no nobodys watching the house
i told you keyes is satisfied
its just for the neighbors
thats what i said
neff hangs up and stands beside the desk with a grim expression on his face takes a handkerchief out and wipes perspiration from his forehead and the palms of his
the gesture has a symbolic quality as if he were trying to wipe away the murder
over his face comes the commentary
i guess i dont have to tell you what i was going to do at eleven oclock keyes
for the first time i saw a way to get clear of the whole mess i was in and of phyllis too all at the same time
yeah thats what i thought
but what i didnt know was that she was all set for me
that she had outsmarted me again just like she always had
the lights are turned on
phyllis is coming down the stairs
she wears white lounging pajamas and she is carrying something small and heavy concealed in a scarf in her right hand
she reaches the front door opens it slightly fixes the catch so that the door can be opened from outside
she switches off the porch light and the hall light
she moves towards the living room where there is still light on
she was all set and waiting for me
it could have been something in my voice when i called her up that tipped her off
and it could have been that she had the idea already
and an idea wasnt the only thing she had waiting for me
on the long table behind the davenport one of the lamps is lit
the only other light in the room is a standing lamp beside the desk
a window toward the back is open and through it comes the sounds of music probably a neighboring radio
phyllis enters and crosses to the table
she puts out the lamp then moves over to the desk and puts out the lamp there
the room is filled with bright moonlight coming in at the windows
phyllis crosses to the chair by the fireplace the one she sat in the first time neff came to the house
she lifts the loose cushion and puts what was in the scarf behind it
as she withdraws the scarf there is a brief glint of something metallic before she covers the hidden object with the cushion again
she turns to the low table in front of the davenport and takes a cigarette from the box
she takes a match and is about to strike it when just then she hears a car coming up the hill
she listens motionless
the car stops
a car door is slammed
calmly phyllis strikes the match and lights her cigarette
she drops the match casually into a tray goes back to the chair sits down and waits quietly smoking
there are footsteps outside the house
over the chair in which phyllis is sitting the hallway is visible through the arch
the front door opens
neff comes in he is silhouetted against the moonlight as he stands there
he closes the door again
in foreground in here walter
neff comes through the arch and walks slowly towards her
anybody else in the house
whats that music
a radio up the street
neff sits down on the arm of the davenport close to her
just like the first time i was here
we were talking about automobile insurance
only you were thinking about murder
and i was thinking about that anklet
and what are you thinking about now
im all through thinking
this is goodbye
where are you going
its you thats going baby
im getting off the trolley car right at this corner
suppose you stop being fancy
lets have it whatever it is
i have a friend whos got a funny theory
he says when two people commit a murder theyre kind of on a trolley car and one cant get off without the other
theyre stuck with each other
they have to go on riding clear to the end of the line
and the last stop is the cemetery
maybe hes got something there
you bet he has two people are going to ride to the end of the line all right
only im not going to be one of them
ive got another guy to finish my ride for me
so youve got it all arranged walter
you arranged it for me
i didnt have to do a thing
just who are you talking about
an acquaintance of yours
come on baby i just got into this because i knew a little something about insurance didnt i
i was just a sucker
id have been brushed off as soon as you got your hands on the money
what are you talking about
im telling this
its been you and that zachetti guy all along hasnt it
thats not true
it doesnt make any difference whether its true or not
the point is keyes believes zachetti is the guy hes been looking for
hell have him in that gas chamber before he knows what happened to him
and whats happening to me all this time
dont be silly
what do you expect to happen to you
you helped him do the murder didnt you
thats what keyes thinks
and whats good enough for keyes is good enough for me
maybe its not good enough for me
maybe i dont go for the idea
maybe id rather talk
sometimes people are where they cant talk
under six feet of dirt for instance
and if it was you theyd just charge it up to zachetti wouldnt they
one more item on his account
sure they would
thats just what theyre going to do
especially since hes coming here tonight
oh in about fifteen minutes from now baby
with the cops right behind him
its all taken care of
and thatd make everything lovely for you wouldnt it
and its got to be done before that suit of yours comes to trial and lola gets a chance to sound off and they trip you up on the stand
and you start to fold up and drag me down with you
maybe i had zachetti here so they wont get a chance to trip me up
so we can get that money and be together
say it again
he came here the first time just to ask where lola was
i made him come back
i was working on him
hes crazy sort of guy quick tempered
i kept hammering into him that she was with another man so hed get into one of his jealous rages and then id tell him where she was
and you know what hed have done to her dont you walter
yeah and for once i believe you
because its just rotten enough
were both rotten walter
only youre just a little more rotten
youre rotten clear through
you got me to take care of your husband and then you got zachetti to take care of lola and maybe take care of me too and then somebody else
would have come along to take care of zachetti for you
thats the way you operate isnt it baby
suppose it is walter
is what youve cooked up for tonight any better
neff gets up from the davenport
he listens to the music for a moment
i dont like this music anymore
its too close
do you mind if i shut the window
phyllis just stares at him
he goes quietly over to the window and shuts it and draws the curtain
phyllis speaks to his back her voice low and urgent walter
neff turns something changes in his face
there is the report of a gun
he stands motionless for a moment then very slowly starts towards her
camera is shooting over his shoulder at phyllis as she stands with the gun in her hand
neff stops after he has taken a few steps
whats the matter
why dont you shoot again
maybe if i came a little closer
neff takes a few more steps towards her and stops again
do you think you can do it now
phyllis is silent
she doesnt shoot
her expression is tortured
neff goes on until he is close to her
quietly he takes the gun out of her unresisting hand
why didnt you shoot baby
phyllis puts her arms around him in complete surrender
dont tell me its because youve been in love with me all this time
i never loved you walter
not you or anybody else
im rotten to the heart
i used you just as you said
thats all you ever meant to me until a minute ago
i didnt think anything like that could ever happen to me
im sorry baby
im not buying
im not asking you to buy
just hold me close
neff draws her close to him
she reaches up to his face and kisses him on the lips
as she comes out of the kiss there is realization in her eyes that this is the final moment
out of the shot the gun explodes once twice
phyllis quivers in his arms
her eyes fill with tears
her head falls limp against his shoulder
slowly he lifts her and carries her to the davenport
he lays her down on it carefully almost tenderly
the moonlight coming in at the french doors shines on the anklet
he looks at it for the last time and slowly turns away
as he does so he puts his hand inside his coat and it comes out with blood on it
only then is it apparent that phyllis shot actually did hit him
he looks at the blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly goes out of the room the way he came
neff comes out of the house
he closes the front door with his right hand
his left arm hangs limp
he takes a few steps down the walk then suddenly hears somebody approaching
he moves behind the palm tree near the walk
a man comes up the steps towards the front door zachetti
just as he reaches the door neff calls to him
come here a minute
i said come here zachetti
zachetti turns and approaches him slowly
the name is neff
and i still dont like it
what do you want
look kid i want to give you a present
he takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a coin
heres a nice new nickel
whats the gag
suppose you go back down the hill to a drug store and make a phone call
neff starts to drop the nickel into zachettis handkerchief pocket
zachetti knocks his hand away
keep your nickel and buy yourself an ice cream cone
the number is granite
ask for miss dietrichson
the first name is lola
she isnt worth a nickel
and if i ever talk to her its not going to be over any telephone
tough arent you
take the nickel
take it and call her
she wants you to
she doesnt want any part of me
i know who told you that and its not true
shes in love with you
always has been
dont ask me why
i couldnt even guess
zachetti just stares at him
neff moves again to put the nickel into zachettis pocket
this time zachetti allows him to do it
now beat it
granite i told you
he motions toward the street below
zachetti goes slowly past him
neff grabs him and pushes him almost violently down the walk
zachetti goes out of shot
the sound of his steps dies away as neff looks after him
then far off in the distance the siren of a police car is heard
neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the house where he parked his car
the desk lamp is still lighted
outside the windows the dawn is slowly breaking
neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone
there are eight or nine used cylinders on the desk beside him
a widening stain of blood shows on the left shoulder of his gray jacket
he is very weak by now and his voice holds a note of utter exhaustion
its almost four thirty now keyes
i wonder if shes still lying there alone in that house or whether theyve found her by now
i wonder a lot of things but they dont matter any more except i want to ask you to do me a favor
i want you to be the one to tell lola kind of gently before it breaks wide open
yes and id like you to look after her and that guy zachetti so he doesnt get pushed around too much
suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling that he is not alone in the room
as he turns in his chair the camera pulls back slowly
the office door is wide open
keyes is standing a few steps inside it
behind him on the balcony outside stands the night watchman and the colored janitor peering curiously into the room over keyes shoulder
slowly and without taking his eyes off neffs face keyes reaches back and pushes the door shut
neff hangs up the dictaphone horn
he looks at keyes with a faint tired grin and speaks very slowly
keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without answering
up pretty early arent you
i always wondered what time you got down to work
keyes staring at him still does not answer
or did your little man pull you out of bed
the janitor did
seems you leaked a little blood on the way in here
wouldnt be surprised
neff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders standing on the desk
i wanted to straighten out that dietrichson story for you
so i gather
how long have you been standing there
kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it
one you didnt quite figure out
you cant figure them all walter
you cant can you
and now i suppose i get the big speech the one with all the two dollar words in it
lets have it keyes
youre all washed up walter
that was short anyway
they stare at each other for a long moment then with intense effort neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a little
his face is covered with sweat
his shoulder is bleeding
he is on the verge of collapse
walter im going to call a doctor
bitterly what for
so they can patch me up
so they can nurse me along till im back on my feet
so i can walk under my own power into that gas chamber up in san quentin
is that it keyes
something like that walter
well ive got a different idea
suppose you went back to bed and didnt find these cylinders till tomorrow morning when the office opens
from then on you can play it any way you like
would you do that much for me keyes
give me one good reason
i need four hours to get where im going
youre not going anywhere walter
you bet i am
im going across the border
you havent got a chance
good enough to try for
youll never make the border
thats what you think
neff starts to move towards the door staggering a little holding himself upright with great effort
in a voice of stony calm youll never even make the elevator
neff has reached the door
he twists the knob and drags the door open
he turns in it to look back at keyes implacable face
so long keyes
neff goes out leaving the door wide open
the camera follows his staggering walk along the balcony towards the elevator lobby
the sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that for a moment it dominates the scene
finally he reaches the swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push them open
at this moment he collapses
he clutches the edge of the door and as it swings around with him he falls to the floor
he tries to struggle up but cannot rise
in background comes the sound of a telephone being dialed
send an ambulance to the pacific building on olive street
its a police job
there is the sound of the phone being replaced in its cradle
then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony and keyes walks slowly into the shot
he kneels down beside neff
how you doing walter
neff manages a faint smile
only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away
theyre on the way
slowly and with great difficulty you know why you didnt figure this one keyes
let me tell you
the guy you were looking for was too close
he was right across the desk from you
closer than that walter
the eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence
i love you too
neff fumbles for the handkerchief in keyes pocket pulls it out and clumsily wipes his face with it
the handkerchief drops from his hand
he gets a loose cigarette out of his pocket and puts it between his lips
then with great difficulty he gets out a match tries to strike it but is too weak
keyes takes the match out of his hand strikes it for him and lights his cigarette
the following pages are for an alternate ending that director billy wilder actually shot but later decided against
theyre on the way
slowly and with great difficulty you know why you didnt figure this one keyes
let me tell you
the guy you were looking for was too close
he was right across the desk from you
closer than that walter
the eyes of the two men meet in a moment of silence
i love you too
neff fumbles for the handkerchief in keyes pocket pulls it out and clumsily wipes his face with it
then clutching the handkerchief against his shoulder he speaks to keyes for the last time
at the end of that
just as i get off
you be there
to say goodbye
will you keyes
showing the witness room and approximately one half of the gas chamber
boom shot towards guard standing back to camera at entrance door
except for this guard the room is empty
guard opens the door
two other guards enter followed by a group of witnesses and newspaper men each of whom removes his hat as he enters the room
they form a group around the outside of the gas chamber some looking in through the glass windows some standing in the background on low platforms against the wall
keyes as he enters the room and stands behind the door
his face is seen through the bars of the door which is then closed and camera moves to a closeup
his eyes follow the action of the closing door then slowly look towards the gas chamber
on its windows show reflections of the spectators including the face of keyes
the door to the gas chamber opens in the background and beyond that another door opens
neff comes in between two guards
he is wearing a white open necked shirt blue denim pants and walks barefooted on a cocoanut matting
he moves into the gas chamber looks through the windows in the direction of keyes and nods quickly recognizing him
the guards turn him around and seat him in one of the two metal chairs with his back to the witnesses
they strap his arms legs and body to the chair
the guards go out
it is open
the three guards come out of the gas chamber into the ante chamber where stand the warden executioner two doctors the minister and the acid man and possibly several guards
the executioner and one guard close the door
the guard spins the big wheel which tightens it
the wheel at first turns very quickly then as it tightens the guard uses considerable force to seal the chamber tight
the guard steps out of the shot
the gas chamber is now sealed
they are intently watching neff in the gas chamber
the warden looks slowly around the room sees that everyone is in his proper place and that the stethoscope which one doctor holds is connected with the outlet in the
wall of the gas chamber
also that the man in charge of the acid is ready
the warden makes a motion to the acid man
the acid man releases the mixed acid into a pipe connecting with a countersunk receptacle under neffs chair
this action is only suggested
the warden looks at the clock then turns to the executioner and nods
he pushes a metal lever
this immerses the pellets of cyanide in the acid under the chair
camera is shooting above neffs head just out of shot towards spectators standing outside the gas chamber keyes in the center
gas floats up into scene between camera and spectators
keyes unable to watch looks away
as he listens on stethoscope connected with the gas chamber
he glances at the clock above his head
he stands to right of the gas chamber door taking notes on a pad
he glances towards first doctor out of scene and looks through venetian blinds into the gas chamber
the acid man stands near him
camera shooting from high angle towards him as he listens on stethoscope
the doctor glances at the clock again
he takes his stethoscope from his ears
he nods to the warden this indicates that the man is dead
camera pans with warden as he turns to open the door connecting the ante chamber with the witness room
the door connecting with the ante chamber opens
a guard comes through
thats all gentlemen vacate the chamber please
the guard withdraws and closes the door by which he entered
the witnesses slowly start to file out
a guard has opened the outer door
the witnesses put their hats on as they pass through
a few go close to the windows of the gas chamber to look in at the dead man before they leave
all the witnesses have now left except keyes who stands shocked and tragic beyond the door
the guard goes to him and touches his arm indicating to him that he must leave
keyes glances for the last time towards the gas chamber and slowly moves to go out
camera shooting in through the open door at keyes who is just turning to leave
keyes comes slowly out into the dark narrow corridor
his hat is on his head now his overcoat is pulled around him loosely
he walks like an old man
he takes eight or ten steps then mechanically reaches a cigar out of his vest pocket and puts it in his mouth
his hands in the now familiar gesture begin to pat his pockets for matches
suddenly he stops with a look of horror on his face
he stands rigid pressing a hand against his heart
he takes the cigar out of his mouth and goes slowly on towards the door camera panning with him
when he has almost reached the door the guard stationed there throws it wide and a blaze of sunlight comes in from the prison yard outside
keyes slowly walks out into the sunshine
stiffly his head bent a forlorn and lonely man
