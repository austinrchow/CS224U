written by pamela pettler short story by shane acker the focus features logo appears on screen and we slide into the o in focus
stock dissolves from mm to mm
grainy like old documentary footage
we see an early incarnation of a machine this will be the inner brain of the fabrication machine
we see the scientist in a white coat
we pull back to see the scientist is playing a complicated multi level d chess game on a multi level game board with the machine
the scientist makes an elaborate multi level move
the machine reaches an arm out into the chess game but then malfunctions and strews the game everywhere
we pull back further to see the back and legs of the dictator with black uniformed soldiers flanking him
the regimes emblem can be seen on the uniforms
give it a chance
were on the machine which is clicking and jerking as it malfunctions
we turns to leave
we hear the clicking of boots as the soldiers accompany him out
we see the scientists dejected face as he comes towards the camera to turn it off
the grainy footage rolls again we see the scientist moving away from the camera having just turned it on
the lab is shadowy late at night
we see his worktable for the first time covered with discarded sketches a furiously filled in journal and pieces of failed machinery the floor is also similarly littered
the talisman sits on the worktable
nearby is a small old fashioned tiny little box
tired but dictating to keep the documentary record complete my last possible solution
muttering to himself it must work
he gently brushes his fingers over the little box as though for good luck
he picks the talisman up off the table
he moves over to insert the talisman into the port of the machine
his back to us he faces the machine
we see him putting something over his face but only from behind
there is a sudden flash of green light and the machine jolts and then suddenly starts up
lighting up electricity crackling parts moving in smooth coordination etc
the scientist waits watching
the machine continues to run
its arms move smoothly almost curiously
the scientist puts the device covering his face down and gets up and comes towards camera
we see the cameras pov as the scientist comes towards us close on the scientists face which is exhausted cheeks sunken eyes wide pupils dilated
pull back to show the machine purring suddenly full of a new sort of energy
something new has happened
the scientist switches off the camera and
the machine zips through the complex d chess game at lightning speed checkmating the scientist in seconds as the dictator watches
the scientist laughs fondly and pats the machine
you see it evolves
the scientist proudly gives the machine to the dictator
a flash goes off someone is taking a picture o
the dictator exits we hear the click of boots and see as much as possible of the soldiers flanking him
close on the machine the dictator is gripping it with a nasty firmness
the machine seems to try to squirm away
the directors black gloved hand grasps it harder
he machine responding to the brutality lashes an arm out and grabs the nearest soldier seen from the back we see only the uniform and helmeted head by the back
of his arm breaking his arm
the soldier falls if possible
he dictator continues on without breaking stride
and we seq
robotic sounding alert
we are in a state of emergency
sounds of war explosions machine guns screams
a tiny cluttered attic filled with bits and pieces of found material burlap door hinges an old shoe old eyeglasses rusty scissors pen nibs gas masks etc
we see the tiny little box sitting on the cluttered makeshift worktable
the machines have become uncontrollable
they are shooting at will
alert stay in your homes
grainy footage as we see the scientist looking around desperately hes obviously in hiding
beauty was taken
he is feverishly cobbling together a small burlap doll
he labels the burlap doll on its back
he makes frantic notes in a journal
he brushes his fingers over the little box for good luck then moves towards a strange contraption on the table
lashes and explosions shake the workshop horribly
reports are coming in
theyve breached the northern walls of the city
the radio voice is drowned out by explosions
an announcement from our chancellor
on the radio comrades i have lost control
the machine is now our enemy
we need to join forces to fight against it
we hear explosions and screams outside
we see the scientist cobbling together another small burlap doll a little more evolved
he labels it then makes notes in a journal
his voice a mere whisper five so far
i cant get them right
through static gas masks are being distributed
we see the scientist desperately grabbing bits and scraps for one last doll
he is like a skeleton almost no energy left
contd deadly gas
he radio voice dies out
we hear nothing but static
the scientist totters over makes a note in his journal
he clutches the little box and suspends this last doll with a rope in a strange contraption
a feeble whisper my last one
this one finally must work
the sound of the scientist collapsing to the floor
attic the thin strand of rope stretches
and the rope snaps and a small burlap figure falls onto the table
as he falls he is yanked free from a large circular machine
e had been attached with the fraying rope and a long cable attached to him by the talisman
the cable still dangles from the machine but the force of his fall pulls the talisman off
the little burlap figure pulls himself to his feet shaking his head
falling free from the connecting cable has finally awakened him
e is made up of odd patchwork items burlap a thick zipper big round gas mask eyes which we recognize as what we saw before in the title sequence
we pull around to see the number painted on his back
we pull back further to see
he is on the tabletop in the ruins of a small room
splintered bits of wall jut up to the open sky
rotted floorboards are bent and warped
the room is full of years of dust and rot
dust hangs in the feeble rays of dirty sunlight
the table and floor are covered with the same kinds of scraps and raw materials from which is made burlap hinges bits of machinery
blinks and turns around his head darting this way and that trying to make sense of his surroundings
he walks over to the edge of the tabletop
he peers over and sees
the scientist lying dead on the floor
lumped on the floor we clearly see the scientists skeletal hand is clutching a tiny box
he hears a clattering sound and turns to see loose window shutter
he goes over to the window
e pushes opens the window to see usting machine carcasses bombed out ruins and emptiness stretch as far as he can see
terrible life ending destruction
here is no other living being anywhere
stares in disbelief and horror and fear
he cant make any sense of it
or the room
or the endless miles of lifeless wasteland stretching out in front of him
e seems to be completely alone
sees a glint of something a possible sign of life
he moves to go outside
he stops and is strangely drawn to the talisman
he turns and takes it stowing it inside his zippered chest before he heads out
meets moves warily in the dusty grim light along the deserted ruins of the outside streets
it is the remains of war
pulverized hulks of buildings torn open suitcases scattered clothes rusting cars and the grim debris of human civilization surround him
he sees a dead body slouched next to a suitcase in the front seat of a car
banners hang on the buildings with a three prong symbol on them
achines lie deserted on the sides of roads
distracted by the spectacle stumbles and lands on a ragged old flyer revolt
he looks back at the war machines and dictator flags
he sees a vandalized poster of what appears to be a dictator leader
looks around him trying to piece together what happened
suddenly there is a clanking sound in front of him
sees a light flicker on in the shattered hulk of a war machine
lose on as the light crosses his face
scared he ducks behind a huge piece of debris
grabs a piece of metal lying in front of him
the shadow moves closer shakes nervously
the figure emerges with spear in hand and swings the weapon at him with all his might
hits him square in the chest
it is another ragdoll
is propelled backwards and falls to the ground on the debris behind him
quickly tries to hide
but is looking at with surprise
he struggles to get up speaking with urgency to
firmly kindly almost eagerly like trying to soothe a wild animal wait
i am a friend
i am a friend
now sees he has hit a ragdoll similar to himself
he hesitates not sure what to make of this
extends his hand calmly eagerly
hesitates again then still timid but showing a little bravery drops his weapon and goes to help up
we see that is much older much more decrepit much more primitively constructed he is made from patchwork bits of old leather shoes
a shoelace stitches up his front and is tied in a bow at his neck
bits of leather fray off him
his feet are primitive small hinges
half of a pair of eyeglasses like an enormous monocle is attached to s hat
helps straighten s monocle
smiles at him
we see that is like a wise mentor a kindly professor with a contagious eagerness and imaginativeness
peers eagerly at
he circles and spots the number on his back
eagerly excited like an intrigued scholar yes
i always thought thered be one more
he nods and smiles
he extends his hand to shake s hand
while doing this he takes s hand and studies it nodding with eager excitement
we see that s hand is more sophisticated than s
turns slightly and sees his number and tries to say it
but no sound comes out of his mouth
looks at him nodding again the kind mentor
hes interested observing without judging curious kindly and ready to help
you cant speak
with a friendly disarming smile he taps s zipper
unzips himself and peers in
looks up happy that he can help
looks around nervously and hurries over to his roller skate cart covered with detritus odds and ends a broken china doll
come with me
follows looking around curiously
finds the china doll
as rummages through the chest of the china doll picks up a bullet casing from s cart and starts tapping it
turns with the dolls voice box in his hand
sees with the bullet whispers sharply no
eases the bullet away from then smiles gently at some things in this world are better left where they lie
e puts the bullet to one side and kneels prying into s chest
begins to connect the dolls voice box
but if you know where to look these ruins are full of riches
concentrates a look of pleasure on his face as he twists a few more wires
static and unclear sound come out at first but as tunes the voice further
as his voice is tuned in
starting with pure static then slowly moving into a voice chhhhhhh
tunes him in almost there
gets a little panicky look on his face at the strange sounds coming out of him
puts a calm hand on his shoulder
calms down and tries again
more and more normal are we alone
there are others
and stare at each other
looks at in wonderment then reaches out and touches s chest where he hit it
beams at happy can speak happy he was able to help and happy that with his first words is concerned about others
glow beams from within s chest
removes the talisman from his chest
has a big reaction he draws his breath in and looks at it in astonishment
he takes it and looks at it
he gives a look of surprise
but how strange
muttering to himself as he turns the talisman in his hands yes he was always drawing this
exactly like this
hey both stare at the talisman
suddenly a is heard offscreen
looks up in horror
he grabs his spear
he pushes away almost fiercely
firmly to seq
cat beast attacks points forcefully to an old rusted can
runs into the can
stands ready to attack
watches wondering what is coming
then from behind him a large claw of a mechanical figure settles softly next to s can
he tries to call out to
and from behind enters t is a nail and razor studded predatory machine with a cat skull shaped head its body laced with bones nails and razors
now understands was trying to protect him
gasps as he turns and sees it
the cat beast lets out a roar and claws at knocking him over and losing his spear
looks on with horror
attempts to reach for his spear but the beast holds him down with its razor sharp feet
the beast is attracted to the talisman
it picks it up with one of its jagged claws and looks at it quizzically
his movement makes his hiding place teeter creaking
he cat beast whirls at the sound
picking up s struggling body the cat beast stalks towards the noise right up to s hiding place sniffing through its hollow nostrils
cringes in terror
the cat beast probes with one of his claws into the tin can
the claws do not find him and retreat
a beat then feels himself violently lifted up and smashed
we see the cat beast has picked up the entire tin can and is smashing it to get at whats inside it
failing it hurls the tin can aside
is almost knocked out
trying to stay conscious he struggles towards the entrance of the can
is pov through his haze and through the broken edges of the opening to the can he sees the cat beast grab the talisman and the struggling in his sharp
toothed mouth and disappearing into the smoky mist
can just make out in the distance the silhouettes of the others
pov spyglass the spyglass searches through the city and comes across a lone staggering figure
pull back to show the back of s head as he peers through the spyglass then pulls away so we can see into the spyglass again
we zoom in through the spyglass to a close shot on staggers weary and collapses
in the foreground the feet of another ragdoll step into the shot
meeting is finishing sewing up
its all right
youre safe now
where am i
he told me there were others
suddenly urgently who
still dazed trying to he was older
out in the emptiness
was he all right
hen is he coming back
looks at him the whole memory suddenly coming back to him as though fresh
cant think of the right hing
it took him
reacts with horror
it cant be
he turns away grief stricken
keeping secrets from me i see
another ragdoll pushes into the workroom
this is a bigger ragdoll the most primitive one we have seen
he has primitive wooden hinges for feet
he is very frayed and patched together
the number is painted on his back
and whirl around
i was coming to tell you
carries himself with authority
he wears a red cloak and a strange mother of pearl and wire hat bound together as an almost papal like headpiece and carries a staff made from an old
gear with a bell attached
pulls at with his staff displaying the number on his back
turns and glares at like a general glaring at a new private expecting an explanation for a misdeed
cringes back obviously intimidated by
i found him
in the emptiness
he saw hooks by the neck with his staff cutting off his speech
what were you doing out there
i saw him from the watchtower and i thought
oull lead the beast straight back to us
how many times have i told you
the beast thats what took
if we hurry we could save him if the beast took him thats the end of it
but he was still alive turns with sudden hope to
might still be alive
no we have rules
smashes his staff against the ground
immediately a knife comes through the curtain revealing another ragdoll a large ragdoll with the number on his arm
our new guest seems confused
condescendingly to perhaps i can help you achieve some clarity
is very large and designed for great strength
he is almost as evolved in his design as but his design favors primarily brute force
he has armored himself with curved pieces of tin and metal
he carries the blade of a large kitchen knife with a nail he has attached for a handle
on his back he has slung another knife half of a scissors the scissors handle loops up above his head
taps his knife in his hand and motions for and to follow
clock tower they walk through the nave and plane up overhead
whispering hopefully he was still alive
i think so looms forward threateningly
quickly stops talking
following his lead stops talking also
the group gets into a bucket like device
pushes hard into the bucket
nods commandingly to
begins to crank a rope that lifts them up
gestures to to hold on
braces himself as pulls them up into a tall tower
he steals a glance at
tries to smile
hey pass an old plane outside that has crash landed in to the cathedral
on the side wall is a round multi colored stained glass window
shafts of different colored sunlight flicker through
he bucket moves past two large church bells into the inside of a clock tower of a once magnificent cathedral
we see the back of the clock the light casting shadows of the backward numbers onto the floor
gestures out towards the outside and addresses when we woke in this world
camera drifts up to the clock
wipe to white
war flashback enter flashback as we see the chaotic inferno of war
contd it was chaos
man and machine attacked each other with fire and metal
the earth split and the skies burned
ragdolls and hide under an old helmet frantically trying to escape the explosions bursting around them
appears with and
we get the sense that is the reckless one the only one determined to scout around and see whats out there
i found others
they are welcomed in by the other dolls
they turn to who is clearly the leader to see what to do next
decides he points forward and they all run a few feet while underneath the helmet
a plane crashes in the background causing to fall behind he has both eyes
hrough a dirty mist we see war machines enter with their weapons
a resistance fighter throws a molotov cocktail at one of the machines
it turns and shoots a round of gunfire
a mustard gas bomb is launched from the top of the machine
it heads straight at but he runs and gets knocked to the ground barely missing it
he bomb lets out a yellow cloud that envelops the area and turns and sees lying face down on the ground
urges her to stay with the others
but again brave and slightly reckless she runs through the yellow cloud to help him
she brings him back to the group
his left eye is damaged
the others cower
the gentle mentor of the group puts a comforting hand on s damaged eye
always the scout brave and fearless points off to the right and addresses
she knows whats out there shes seen it
theres a path ahead looks around calculatingly like patton the general taking charge
he thinks judiciously then go ahead
nods and darts off
turns to the others who wait for their instructions
to the others follow me
they hurry off increasingly enveloped by the yellow cloud
the yellow cloud transitions into steam
contd the gas killed everything
meets the steam is rising from the small thurible in the clock i led us here
is now standing at the thurible with a torch in his hand
contd to sanctuary
and here we waited for the war to end
he puts his hand around s shoulders and walks him over to the other side of the room
slowly the world became silent
and walk over to a picture of the cat beast hanging on the wall
the only thing that remains now is the beast
faces as the torch slowly fades
so we stay hidden and we wait for it too to sleep
he torch burns out
but where did it come from
why is it hunting us
questions like that are pointless
we need to protect ourselves
keep ourselves out of danger
but one of us is in trouble
he could still be rescued
turns and walks to a tattered calendar page on the wall with the days and crossed off
oo many of us have already been lost
crosses s number off the calendar with the burnt end of his torch
youre not listening
he may still be alive
why wont you try to save him
why wont you angrily smacks his staff on the floor
enough of this madness
to annoyed go to the watch tower and take our guest with you
meekly immediately obeys gesturing to to follow him
we hear a strange whispering sound and camera instead of following and stays behind and moves in on a shadowy little area
there we see
is ink stained and has a strange quality as though he sees and hears things inside his head that only he experiences
he has a small skeleton key around his neck and his fingers are made of pen nibs
he is drawing on a piece of paper and whispering to himself
muttering whispering the source
we see he is drawing the talisman
in fact his whole area is covered with drawings of the talisman
telescope rom a high angle we see the nave of the cathedral
it has been bombed and attacked and there is a plane intersecting through the side
the camera moves to the left and what seems like a prow of a boat comes into frame
we find ourselves in
had created a sort of lookout
a rickety jury rigged spyglass points out of a hole in the wall
a half drawn map is pinned up next to the spyglass
everything is pieced together from the sorts of bits and pieces we saw scavenging
around the space we also see more bits and pieces that has found out in the wilderness
he touches the spyglass sadly
this was the first thing we built together
looking around at the map bits and pieces etc
all his work
trying to make sense of everything
he looks out into the wilderness
is he out there
is he still alive
he could be
looks out in fear
we see the conflict on his face fear of going out there but a desperate longing to see his old friend again
conspiratorially looking around to make sure theyre not being spied we could go after him
shocked and amazed this is impossible us
no one else will
imploring him we must go
is silent afraid
looks through the spyglass
pov spyglass the three tall shapes in the distance
thats where the creature took him
out towards those three tall shapes
we need to stay here
as though repeating something hes heard from we have rules
looks at him
he recognizes s words
why do you listen to
repeating what hes been indoctrinated with a group must have a leader
looks at him for a beat
but what if the leader is wrong
looks a little shocked
he never thought of this
we see in s face that he is considering s question but he still cant bring himself to disobey
sees he is having an effect on
suddenly firmly im going
im going to look for him
he turns to
come with me
i cant do it alone
is terribly torn
he wants to but hes never done anything like this before
hes always done as hes told
he cant odo d he cant c nt it i cant
looks directly into his eyes
he knows how loved and admired his mentor and everything he did
he understands that would like to be like to do what would have done
but wouldnt he have come for you
but looks away
he wants to do it but he doesnt have the nerve
he turns away
hesitates looking down then more determined wait
grabs the map off the wall and rolls it up
he walks towards
youre going to need a map
and smile at each other
wasteland and look behind them at the cathedral as they start to make their journey to find
and pick their way through the rubble
they have traveled miles from the cathedral
mist swirls in front of them obscuring their path
and look around constantly on the alert for the cat beast
piles of rusted broken metal machines broken skeletal bones exploded vehicles tipped into craters and crumbling disintegrating buildings surround them
looks up and follows his gaze to s staff stuck in a pile of rubble atop a hill
hurries up the hill
turns to find s hat lying in the dirt
he bends down to pick it up brushing the dust off the top
looks sadly at s broken hat
you looked out for him
he looked out for me
he taught me
he spoon light falls off
s face is filled with grief
why was he out here alone
puts his hand on s shoulder reassuring him
we can still find him
e stands up determinedly
hesitates but then his face filling with hope gets up too
puts s hat on his quiver
offers s staff to but gestures to for him to hold it
they continue on through the debris and devastation
a storm is starting to come up
the wind howls loudly
why was he out here alone
a good question
the ones were not supposed to ask
they exchange a look
this is the first time has said something to actually challenge s rules
notices this and nods
the wind howls louder
looks at his map uncertainly and tries to keep leading them forward
they come to a field full of trip mines and dangerous tank trap pits
a parachute blows in the wind on a tree branch
turns the map one way and the other with growing panic
here are we
i dont know
as he turns the map to look at it the wind picks up and blows the map out of s hands
it blows away into the distance and gets stuck on a pole
reaches after it desperately but cant retrieve it
he looks in despair at
its no use
we should go back
looks around bravely then points over towards a trench
they head over to the trench
they now see a huge footprint they inspect the footprints
moves bravely towards the trench entrance
its too dark
we can use that
e points to a lightbulb in a broken headlight
is pointing to the lightbulb
cant help himself
he pulls the lightbulb out pulls out a battery and electrical wire from his chest winds the wire around the battery and places it inside the hat
they screw the lightbulb and it lights up
cant help smiling at
unwinds the wire holding the blade on s staff
he places s hat on the end of s staff and secures it with the blade
he sees that now has made a lightstaff
he blurts out will be so impressed
a terrible grief suddenly comes over him as he remembers what has happened to
puts his hand on s shoulder bracing him
is conveying with his simple words that he believes is still alive and he will be impressed when he sees the lightstaff
shines the light to gesture this way
smiles tremulously at almost more grateful for his sympathy and support than necessarily believing him
he follows to the mouth of the trench
the camera pans over to reveal catlike scratchmarks on a side wall indicating this is the same trench we saw the cat beast travel through earlier
recoils but puts a calming hand on him again then puts both hands on the lightstaff and enters the trench
takes a deep breath and follows
and continue down the trench both looking around with great caution and nervousness
s they come around a corner they see the cat beast
springs into action shooting his weapon at the beast
shines his light up to see
an old hanging gas mask
hey look at each other and laugh as they continue down the trench
and contd the mask drops behind them and they scream and run away
and contd someone is watching them
and climb up a hill of sand bags
they come around a corner
weve been here before
its no use
steps over and pushes some debris aside
suddenly they can see they are right next to
the factory the factory a enormous destroyed old stone building its caved in ceiling revealing huge boilers scarred old metal walkways and catwalks dangling dust covered rotting turbines exposed to
they creep into the enormous hulk of a building
in the center of the building are the splintered vestiges of an enormous enormous metal arms lie motionless
huge steel hooks tower over the belt with sharp edged pieces of machinery dangling from them
they look around in horror
arge pieces of machinery pipes and ducts dangle from the ceilings
layers of dust cover everything like eerie blankets
bundles of wires lie ripped from their moorings
ools and shards of glass and metal are strewn around the floor twisted into strange melted shapes
hey walk through lines of large missiles lined up in rows
why would it bring him here
they slide down a duct and land in a pile of debris
they now see imprisoned in an old birdcage
in the b
the cat beast lurks next to a pile of what seems like debris and broken machinery
the talisman is on the floor next to the cat beast
the cat beast seems to be looking for something in the debris
the cat beasts back is to us
factory chase and hurry forward towards
they find seemingly lifeless
deep regret i shouldnt have waited
stands compassionately respecting s grief
pats s shoulder
t the pat blinks awake
i knew you would come
i thought cutting him off shhh
he motions towards the beast
and try to pry the bars open
tries to help
they just manage to pry the bars open and get out when suddenly a light shines above them
they look up and see the cat beast beaming his light from his eye
the three dolls run away frantically
the cat beast chases after them
gets cornered but swipes the beast and manages to escape
jumps a heap of debris but stumbles
and pull him up to higher ground
shoots his crossbow at the cat beast shattering his eye
manages to hide in a tube
and run away but get stuck at the end of a table
the cat beast slashes his claw at them
they climb onto another piece of debris only to encounter the cat beast now in front of them
he cat beast slashes a claw out and knocks them over
the cat beast moves closer and closer
they are doomed
uddenly there is a strange rhythmic moaning sound
the cat beast turns distracted
we pan over and see a mysterious creature that seems to be half ragdoll half bird with a bird skull head swinging a weapon over its head
releases the weapon a strap of leather with weighted shot at either end
the weapon flies through the air with a low whooshing sound and strikes the cat beast entangling it
and now charge the cat beast
shoots his crossbow entangling the beasts paw and hobbling it
and both lure the cat beast in different directions deliberately goading and further causing it to become entangled in the machinery
now leaps up over the beast and brings the full weight of her spear down on the cat beasts neck
the head of the beast comes off and lands at their feet
now pulls off her bird skull helmet
you werent lost youve come back
i never left
you finally decided to join the fight
he hands s map back to him
comes over with her shield lost during the fight
i think i know why
they move towards her but she turns and looks at
and nod proudly towards
hey all look at the fallen cat beast
is poking at it
shoddy pile of scrap
they all turn to leave
and support on either side of him helping along
hangs back to look at the machine again and suddenly sees the talisman lying on the floor
and have continued on without him and do not see him as he picks it up
looks at the strange object with enormous curiosity
he turns it and see the runes on the side of it
he turns and inspects it closely
he turns and discovers on the machine a port with the same runes
blurting out look
the others now turn to see him
they see him holding the talisman close to the machines port
about to experimentally put the talisman into the port
tries to break free and stagger towards him but it is too late
puts the talisman into the port
othing happens for a moment
then suddenly horribly the ground begins to shake
fabrication machine suddenly the cat beasts dead body begins to shift and move
there is a rumbling from beneath it as
a large form rises up from under the debris
angle on the machine awakening movement under the cloth a claw like appendage rising from the rubble
they try to climb to safer ground from the tumbling debris
is thrown back and lands hard
a mechanical arm emerges and pins and
as dust and debris rain down we see one hideous red eye begin to come up
s tries to scramble to safety the other three ragdolls pinned by the mechanical arm stare in horror
we see that the pile of machinery has risen to reassemble into an monstrous towering fabrication machine attached to the ceiling of the building
it is enormous a spherical shape with a dozen folded appendages each with different fabrication tools at the end of its long spindly robotic arms
tries to crawl away but the machine grabs him with his robotic arm
he machine points the talisman towards and it opens up to a sparking green glow
struggles in the machines claw but the strange green energy shoots directly into s mouth and eyes painfully his soul
ngle on as his soul is being taken
slumps over his lifeless carcass smoking in the grip of the machine
ngle on the green glow as it passes into the machine
the sound has drawn its attention
the machine turns towards them and grabs at them with its enormous claw
and turn and flee
the fabrication machines arms chase after them
shoots his grappling hook onto a switch
and grab onto him
frantically working together the three of them manage to escape the machines horrifying arms
important to make sure the machine is understood to be tethered to the factory
they see in the distance a pipe that leads out
in the machines red pov they run into it just as the machines arm is behind them but cant fit into the hole
going to the library and escape out a long tube that leads out from the factory and jump behind a small trench
my poor old friend
puts a consoling hand on his shoulder
shaking her head i know
turning on what
what on earth were you thinking
just as devastated i didnt know
he stares in horror at the factory
what was that
what is it doing
hey are interrupted by a loud whirring sound from the machinery inside the factory
they whirl around then stare at each other horrified
what will it do now
shakes his head miserably
looks at them
she strides off
turns grieving towards the factory head bowed
he hesitates then goes after and
the twins and enter into a building through a hole that has been put in a side wall
they enter the ruins of an old library
giant stacks of random tattered stained books globes and celestial devices tower over them
dusty rays of light beam down through broken glass skylights casting filtered light on shelves and shelves of old tomes papers and crumbling artifacts
stops to look at a beautiful painting showing life and the world before the apocalypse
whispering to himself so beautiful
grabs the lightstaff from and shines it towards a pile of books
a glimmer of two sets of eyes appear and disappear
holds her hand up gesturing to to hold still
emerge from their globe
delighted relieved theyve been here
the whole time
the twins venture out
to and explaining theyve been hiding here
lost in the past
and approach with curiosity
they communicate by beaming ideas to each other
they look at sizing him up
they beam their ideas to each other excitedly
puts a reassuring hand on
and take s lightstaff
their chattering and beaming gets more intense as they take it and catalogue it their eyes clicking as if theyre recording on film what they are seeing
she has an urgent look on her face
we need you we awakened something interrupts her to take full responsibility for the mistake
i awakened something
in the factory
and look at each other with horror
they begin to chatter feverishly and with great distress
hey beam an image of the fabrication machine on the wall
and lean forward startled
recognizing it thats it
what is it
and now show newspaper photograph of the scientist and the machine which we recognize from before in the prologue when the scientist gave the machine to the dictator and we
saw the flash of the flashbulb
we now push into the photo to a close up on the machine
then dissolve into a newsreel of the machine and see the original machine being wired into the fabrication dutch angle shots of the dictator and we hear his speech yes
we have entered a new future the age of the intelligent machine
this remarkable invention can adapt and evolve creating new machines machines of a slight chilling pause shots of the killing machines marching out as theyre dictator v
contd that will usher in a new era of shots of the machines attacking a newspaper headline hundreds killed at peace rally dictator v
contd and brotherhood for our nation
now terrible sounds of war a newspaper headline war declared after unprovoked attack still photos showing the war the machines getting more and more devious chasing a mother and child
down an alley more and more machines appearing
shaky hand held amateur footage showing the gas killing everything
the footage ends with the camera sinking to the ground as whoever is operating it is overcome by gas
ending on a still photo that we pan across showing total the ragdolls stare at it
turns to them
what have i done
shakes her head sadly and impatiently
suddenly turns to
quickly sketches out a drawing of the talisman and shows it to the twins
and chatter trying to analyze and catalogue the drawing of the talisman
they shake their heads they dont recognize it
eeing it as a drawing is startled
he always draws that
used to keep the drawings
with his notes
would they still be there
in s old workshop
slightly embarrassed i saved everything
hen well go back
perhaps the answer is there
looks alarmed and looks over at
shakes her head
i think the answer is there
she points out towards the factory and strides off dauntless fine and proud
the twins chatter unhappily beaming flickering lights to each other
nods and they set off in the other direction
winged beast creation
inside the factory a very quick shot of the fabrication machine reaching its arms out and gathering things
it welds metal pieces
it grabs an enormous black and red dictators flag and rips it in half
we do not see yet what it is creating
confrontation and sneak into s workshop
a dirty moonlight filters through the air
s light is off
familiar with the layout locates s stash of s drawings
the pages are dotted with s annotations and drawings he was obviously trying to figure out why kept imagining this object and what it meant
and bend over the drawings
they are unable to see clearly in the murky darkness
looks around warily then switches on his light
the light now reveals looming in the shadows
seizes them and escorts them out
sitting on his throne glares in righteous anger as and stand in front of him
you awakened what
he gets onto his feet angrily
hunches over one of his sketches muttering to himself
i warned you
is sharpening his knife on the side
he warned you
now youve put us all in unimaginable peril
and may i ask did you manage to save
of course not
by following this witless folly youve endangered everything we work for
why was sent out to begin with
i sent him to scout
that doesnt make any sense
you dont send the oldest out to trying to control look we need to figure out whats going on emerges from his shadowy corner and comes over to
he has a drawing of the talisman and seems to want to show it urgently
softly trying to tell him of something but unable to fully articulate it the source
you must go back to the source
turning to what
what is it
bangs his staff against the floor
stands at attention
i wont allow you to endanger us further
take their belongings
grabs s drawing and lifts from his crossbow and shakes him up
tries to stop him
punches out of the way knocking him to the edge of the floor
a knocked chess piece falls down the dark abyss below them
slowly gets up and addresses
oure nothing but a coward
lets out a gasp
heads towards as he laughs and cracks his knuckles menacingly
suspicious angry how dare you challenge me
i who kept everyone safe all these years
ever since you got here everything has been unraveling
youre a curse
a fool guided by pointless queries
gritting teeth angry determined effort at end as pulls the staff out of s hand nd you are a blind man guided by fear
holds onto the key around his neck looking afraid
the sky is breaking
a shadow comes over them with a faint sound of something outside
starts to back away
ometimes fear is the appropriate response
the winged beast tail crashes through the stained glass window and breaks into the floor right next to
looks bewildered and doesnt move
pulls him out of danger
whispering reflexively the source
and huddle together
suddenly the winged beast comes crashing in the window behind them knocking over the thurible and splashing hot coals all over the floor
winged beast attacks and see the winged beast emerge from the smoke pouring out of the upset thurible
the winged beast shrieks at them
it catches its foot on the runner leading up to s empty throne
the hymnboard calendar topples away to reveal hiding behind it
instinctively clutches his staff causing the bell at the top of the staff to ring and attracting the winged beasts attention
charges the beast but it scythes its wing towards him and knocks across the floor
slides across the floor to who stands next to s picture of the cat beast
pushed the picture of the cat beast away to reveal a hidden passageway
runs away as looks at the others for a brief moment before also running away
the winged beast turns its attention to and
the ragdolls run for the bucket and bell ropes but trips
the winged beast advances towards him
reaches out to
gestures to him to continue without him
as recovers himself and makes a break for the bucket starts to lower the bucket down
just as the winged beast is about to catch up with him leaps down the shaft and lands in the bucket with and
angrily the beast lashes its harpoon tail down at them piercing the bottom of the bucket
the bucket rocks and is sent flying out but catches him in the nick of time
the winged beast starts reeling its harpoon tail in
jerking back and forth the bucket ascends drawing the ragdolls closer and closer to the beast
spots a small ledge next to a stained glass window
he opens the side of the bucket and gestures that they should jump
the others hesitate but then and jump out of the bucket onto a swinging rope and onto the ledge
the winged beast plummets down the shaft after them
the ragdolls squeeze through a small crack in the stained glass emerging onto a ledge overlooking the cathedrals roof
sees and running across the roof and points to and to look down there
down on the roof and see and
pushes past and runs farther out towards the front of the cathedral
uddenly the winged beast smashes through the glass behind them
it struggles to get through the window but cant quite fit
is very vulnerable out there
take him inside
now climbs out on the gargoyle purposefully
the winged beast flies up into the air circling lazily
and running on the top of the roof are very exposed
hawklike the winged beast sails towards them
steps up to defend
he flips his salt shaker helmet down over his face as armor pulls out his scissor knife and stands his ground
waiting for the winged beast to soar in closer
and then at the last possible moment he hurls his scissor knife at the winged beast
it flies through the air and catches in the beasts propeller
knocked off balance the beast swoops down
ducks out of the way but it knocks off his feet
slides down the sloped edge of the roof towards gaping hole
just as is about to fall into the hole he catches on to the edge
his other blade plummets through the hole as he hangs desperately
his grip slipping
catches up to where is
and run down the banisters towards the crashed plane
seems to pull in a particular direction
the winged beast circles around and sets its harpoon tail to shoot
squints into the sun as the winged beast backlit swoops down towards them
he sees a glare come from the tin roof
gets an idea
he gestures to to help him
scowls but has no alternative but to help him
peels back a piece of the roof with helping him
the beams right into the eyes of the winged beast momentarily blinding it
he beast flinches just as it fires its harpoon tail at them
blinded by the glare it misses and almost hits
the harpoon imbeds itself into a rafter inside the cathedral
wing falls onto and then slides down the harpoons line swinging into the cathedral and landing on the wing of the airplane embedded in the side of the cathedral right
next to and
s weight on the harpoons line has pulled it more and more taut
the winged beast is pulled hard into the roof and slides down knocking into and
and plunge into the cathedral and onto the plane wing where catches them in midair before they hit the wing
the winged beast plummets after them onto the wing
it picks itself up spots the cowering ragdolls and opens up his bladed beak screaming
the winged beast starts to charge them when suddenly drops down from a high parapet and leaps onto the winged beasts neck
and stare in surprise
stares in delight and relief
stunned and surprised
mmediately the beast throws her off towards the others
shed dropped her spear she goes to pick it up and pfffffft immediately her leg is impaled by the winged beast which has fired its harpoon
she is impaled next to the guys
i thought you might need some help
but as she speaks the beast begins to reel her in
she fights viciously
jumps and grabs on to as shes being pulled away
grabs her forked spear and hands it to her
she grabs her forked spear and stabs it into the plane
the harpoons cable is pulled taut between her leg and the winged beast
yelling to the others the cable
runs to recover the blade that slipped from his grasp as he slid down the roof then runs over and slices with all his brute force through the cable
the cable flies up in the air and wraps itself around the propeller on the end of the wing
the winged beast jerks back towards the propeller causing the whole wing of the plane to tilt and the ragdolls to slide
and tumble into the planes engine room
clutches her staff
slides by her and grabs on to the harpoon still lodged in her leg
s staff slides by and catches it just before it falls off the wing
as climbs up onto the same buttress fragment that s spear is lodged in slides down the wing past
to holding out his grab on
grabs s staff
dangling he sees that the winged beast is close behind snapping at him with its beak
sees and in the engine room
shouting to the propeller
start the propeller
points to the wires
and gather wires and set to work
they zap the propeller to life and it groans
then whines into motion as it starts taking up the power it had generated
it goes faster
even as the beast is slowly drawn towards the propeller it struggles forward and grabs s cape in its beak
as the winged beast pulls closer strains to hang on to and strains with the added weight on the harpoon sticking out of her wounded leg
let it go
glares furiously hesitates then undoes the clasp
the winged beast falls backwards down the wing directly into the it is instantly shredded
claws feathers and strange mechanical debris shower down
and look in relief as the beast is finally destroyed
fter the clasp is released has meanwhile recoiled into s arms
there is a brief moment of awkwardness as and realize how close they are physically to each other
begins to climb up the side of the wing using dangling and as a ladder
perched on top of s staff reaches up for who is crouched on the edge of the buttress
he grabs s hand gesturing imperiously to to pull him up
looks at urgently nodding to her
she gets it immediately and grabs s leg stopping him
we can still save ourselves
the plane teeters down to a degree angle
and look up at the rest of the ragdolls from farther down the wing
is concerned and almost panicked
is almost zen peaceful as though he can foresee it will be all right
looks around and sees the rope tied around s waist
throws it down to who ties it to his own waist
the plane tilts
its hanging even more precariously now
about to fall out of the side of the cathedral entirely
suddenly jumps down into the flames just as the plane starts to fall
shouts with stress
the plane explodes as it hits the ground smoke rising from the crash
the rope pulls taut and after the smoke settles we can see dangling with and
pulls the hanging chain of ragdolls up and onto the buttress fragment
s recovers himself and straightens his hat he glances up
towards the smouldering clock tower
sanctuary lost we can see in the distance the cathedral on fire
the ragdolls have come to the library
embers from the burning cathedral drift down like burning snowflakes
the others try to avoid the embers
moves purposefully towards the library
stands mourning his sanctuary
his staff is charred and ruined
he lets it drop
takes s arm and urges him to follow the others
seamstress being constructed inside the factory a shot of the fabrication machine reaching its arms out and gathering remnants and detritus that we will see later as part of the
the machine is clearly tethered to the factory
ne of the machines arms discovers s body
the arm seems horribly interested
library and have come to a clearing in the debris outside the globe
has dropped to the floor and is drawing his pattern
looks angrily up at the glass ceilings
ts not safe here
shakes his head agreeing with his boss
to keeping his sense of responsibility stand lookout
points out into the gardens
ill search out a safer retreat
moves away looking for what he might find in the way of a safer retreat
proud to receive orders strides off towards the garden taking care to step onto s drawing and smear it
he laughs meanly
shakes his head sadly and takes another piece of parchment to start over
he is drawing the talisman
looking up at the sky to there will be more wont there
looks worriedly after s retreating form
looking after s retreating form forget him
the twins appear in the crack of the globe
they flash their eyes and gesture for to come in
moves away into the globe
sees the twins and happily skitters towards them
and are left alone
works deftly on s leg
you wanted us to forget you too
why did you leave us
looks around trying to find the right words
finally i couldnt sit and hide just waiting
i just couldnt
contrite trying to explain herself to her its not in my nature
nods smiling ruefully
and perhaps no longer in yours either
smiles and nods almost shyly
hes finished fixing her leg
she flexes it and smiles at him
now she looks around worriedly sensing something
the seamstress plays with his magnet foolishly
flash of something slithering
looks around but continues to play
a flash again of something slithering closer
looks up in horror
lights flash on his face
confrontation lose on a drawing of the talismans runes in ancient illuminated manuscript
pull back to see the twins have found this and are showing it to
and crowd around
is clutching his drawing of the talisman
looks out of the globe intuitively startled her scouts sense unhappy
she senses something
looks at her but also now studies the drawings and the writings around them that explain them
he studies the drawings of the runes
studying the drawings an alchemists ability to draw animus into the unanimated
he turns the page and sees a drawing of the talisman
he gazes at the picture as though drawn to it
what is it
what can it be
comes over and recognizes his drawing
trying to help the source
turns urgently to him what
what are you trying to say
helplessly trying to articulate something the first room now appears out of the darkness
he sees the manuscript and the drawings of the runes
we whip pan over and see standing in the entrance to the globe
what good does this useless rubbish do us
he seems unusually agitated
moves towards him curiously
hat do you know
e comes closer to
turns and meets s gaze unflinchingly
we have a moment of admiration for the old soldiers toughness
but he speaks now with a strange bitterness
he gestures around at the library at the ruins of humanitys civilization
i know enough to leave their ancient evils to moulder
look what they have left us with
leave it be i say
always asking questions so many pointless questions probing pushing spitting out the words beginning to rant and rave a little like he always had to know too i was right
you did send him out to die
he was old
he was weak
suddenly realizes what hes said
he collects himself and stands tall defending himself
sometimes one must be sacrificed for the good of many
leaps angrily at pulling her blade to s neck
her blade flashes at s neck
leaps forward and blocks her
stands proudly staring down s blade
again we almost admire the old soldiers fortitude
s reckless anger blazes from her face
looks at the two of them
we must work together
we must use our thoughts not our weapons
moves back towards the drawing of the talisman and looks down at it
the answer to all our questions is here in some way
i can feel it
we must follow this path
glares furiously at all of them then turns to address
your path takes us to catastrophe
e strides away
seamstress picks his way through the stacks ranting to himself
ant he see his way only brings trouble
what good comes from his path
i know what we need
i know what is right
suddenly he hears a sound
the twisted corpse of comes floating out from the stacks like banquos ghost
stops rigid with terror
s eyes click on with their hypnotic gaze
s scream echoes through the library
the others rush out of the globe
they race towards into an area of the library with a large broken fountain
the fountain is sunken into the library floor with statuary reaching up into the library
hey now see to their horror a hideous serpent like creature with needle like claws and a the seamstress has sewed the carcass of into her tail in order to
lure and mesmerize the ragdolls
she emits a glowing light through s vacant eye sockets
she rises up and points her sewing needles at
we see s limp body trapped in her belly
the other ragdolls leap into action
chops off the tail and with it s carcass but then is thrown to the side and trapped as a cascade of books fall on her
manages to grab who is partially sewn on to the seamstress but cant free him
the seamstress lashes out towards them
fires an arrow and hits the seamstresss eye blinding her
she turns to flee dragging with her
struggles in mortal terror
pulls the blade from s staff from his quiver and throws it to
catches the blade and cuts the threads away from s body trying to free him unsuccessfully as struggles
t the very last moment they manage to cut loose
but the seamstress suddenly darts one of her claws out grabs and slithers off out through the library alt through part of a drainpipe in the bottom of the fountain
with still attached to her belly and disappears
he other ragdolls run after her but it is futile she is gone
burial and regrouping the ragdolls stand in the bottom of the fountain where remnants of water still linger and water dribbles into the drainpipe at the bottom of the fountain
alt next to the fountain
the coin in s crown falls to the ground
he sits down heavily
the twins emerge eyes wide
theyve seen the whole thing
they look with alarm at everyone and sadly at s carcass
looks in the direction of where the seamstress disappeared
i have to get her back
i have to go after her
its too late
e has a strange sad look on his face
he looks in the same direction
itll kill her too
it didnt kill him
its taking contd to the them back machine
the twins look up and nod their agreement
while the others have been talking they have found a book cover and have lain s body on it
they now put the sword on top of like a fallen soldier and put his hands on his chest holding the sword
we have to go all of us
we have to rescue them nodding soberly and destroy the machine for once and for all
just bows his head
hes still mourning
gives him a compassionate look
they turn towards the twins and see them pick up s coin and place it on top of s face
they see that the twins have prepared s body for burial
hey all bow their heads
the twins now slowly send floating down the remnants of water in the drainpipe at the bottom of the fountain
pulls out the piece of burlap from s back with his number on it
he hands it to
looks at and the twins soberly
they look at him
slowly they nod as though accepting their mission
suddenly he looks so very old so very tired
he stares down at floating away
slowly he nods as well
destroying the factory a shot of the tallest smokestack
it belches smoke darkening the dusk sky
we pan down and see seeker drones that the newly vitalized fabrication machine has constructed floating in the air around the factory tirelessly looking for enemies
one of them floats near to camera and its searchlight fixes on something
we follow the light down
the light reveals a pumping oil derrick also newly awakened
its pump moves up and down in sinister rhythm
the light moves away from the derrick
camera stops following the light and keeps moving down arriving at the ground where we now see in the darkness the ragdolls
they huddle behind an oil pipe waiting for the seeker drone to pass
is weak but is supported by who has been patching him and is just finishing up pulling the last thread out of the patch hes sewn onto
is regaining his strength
the twins huddle behind
looks out past the pumping derricks and sees an entrance to all right
ill go inside
you do as we planned
exactly as we planned
he others nod
nods proudly taking the responsibility
darts purposefully towards the factory
looks around keenly looking up for seeker drones then runs out from cover over to a huge barrel that lies half buried in the scorched earth
a painting of the dictators symbol is stenciled on the side
he taps on the front
it is full
he looks up in the air at the seeker drones
they havent seen him
we gestures to the others
e see the barrel is on top of a small hill that leads down to coal car tracks
the tracks lead to the open mouth of a coal chute that feeds into the factory
sees a bent spoon on the ground
he smiles remembering and his ingenuity and picks it up
he hands it to
with confidence now he looks around
he sees a splintered pile of wood planks the remains of a wooden derrick platform
he looks at the others and gestures to the wood
darts from hiding place to hiding place inside the darkened factory moving towards the fabrication machine
he spots the half blinded seamstress and watches in horror as he sees that the seamstress is giving up to the fabrication machine
is too late to do anything to stop the machine from sucking s soul
here is a bright green glow as s soul is sucked and in the sudden illumination sees
she is sewn into the seamstress but is still alive
ngle on as he realizes she is still alive and he can still rescue her
from his hiding place he looks around for a way to rescue her
he inspects the machinery near him
he sees a lever and gears
he looks at his lightstaff
he then spots a remnant of the fabric used to create the winged beast
we see he is formulating a plan
he darts his hand out to drag the fabric towards him
ngle on the fabrication machine as it begins to power back up after taking s soul
ngle on the seamstress
she turns to get and give her to the fabrication machine
we see the terror and defiant fury in s eyes but she is immobilized and can do nothing
suddenly the seamstress hears a sound
she whips around
ov through the seamstresss damaged eye a movement in the shadows
he seamstress distracted from her morbid mission with slithers towards the movement
in the shadow we see a ragdoll with glowing eyes
sees this and registers recognition relief and also terror at what will be s fate
but she is unable to move or speak and now just as could only watch s soul being sucked out can only helplessly watch as the seamstress slithers closer and
closer to its prey
we see the misery on s face
the seamstress raises her needles and strikes the ragdoll sewing wildly
the ragdoll swings out from a string attached to a lever
the lever now moves down because of the weight of the ragdoll and switches on machinery
gears start to turn and we see the ragdoll is attached and begins to drag the trapped seamstress in arms first
he gears crunch the ragdoll
but then her expression turns to amazement as she suddenly sees it is not a ragdoll at all but is s light staff dressed in fabric
instinctively she looks up a sudden hopeful look on her face
just as swings in and lands on the seamstress tearing a hole in her back
he slides down the length of her body freeing
and fall to the ground as the gears now crush the and the twins crouch behind the barrel
we see they have built two paths of wooden boards leading down to the entrance of the coal chute have dug a trench under the barrel and have placed a
long bar of metal beneath the barrel
hoarse whisper they all pull down with all their weight
the barrel lifts and teeters then tips and races down the hill
at the bottom it launches off the boards spinning into the air and landing on the rails to the coal chute with a sparking crash
he ragdolls race down after it
the barrel rolls and comes to a stop right at the mouth of the coal chute
always looking around warily for the seeker drones directs and the twins to conceal themselves behind the barrel
he anxiously stares down the tunnel
here are they
the twins eyes flicker anxiously
looks down the tunnel as well
its been too long
we should take action
are you forgetting what he said
if he doesnt return continue as planned
he peers down into the darkened tunnel
exactly as planned
he grabs a sharp piece of metal and stabs the side of the barrel
he stuffs an old rag into the hole and grabs a match out of s quiver
immediately a beam of bright light focuses down on them
they look up and see one of the horrible seeker drones floating directly above them
its two slug like eyes reel in recognition
the wail of an air raid siren pierces the still night
and sneak towards the coal chute escape
they hear the siren go off
he siren alerts the fabrication machine to their presence
they turn and see the fabrication machines arms bearing down on them the fabrication machine is still clearly tethered to the factory
scores of small spider beasts emerge from the shadows towards them
and race desperately towards the coal chute escape with the spider beasts crawling and spinning after them
instinctively fires his grappling hook at the drone
and the twins try to drag the drone down
brandishes the match
we suddenly hear the sound of the spiders
looks down the tunnel
we have to act
strikes the match on the side of the oil barrel and is about to light the rag
grabs his arm
not yet they tussle over the lighted match when suddenly what did i tell you
and run towards them
the eyes of the spiders can be seen right behind them
looks at the burning match in his hands thinking about what he almost did
sets the rag on fire
the ragdolls jump behind the barrel and push it into the tunnel
and just make it leaping out of the tunnel as the flaming barrel hurtles down the tunnel dragging the seeker drone with it crunching over the unseen beasts and landing
in the factory and he dolls run from the blast
and look on in triumph
the dolls celebrate the ragdolls walk up to the hill away from the explosions
and the twins pick up old debris along the way and study it
he group turns and watches the factory as it burns to the ground
the past is dead
turns to her face full of gratitude
and some of us very much alive
warmly clasps her arm
she pats his hand
they look with great affection and appreciation at each other
the twins chatter theyve found an old victrola lying in the debris with an old warped record still on it
they climb onto the record tripping the needle arm onto the disc and begin walking on the record
a scratchy old melody comes from the large victrola amplifying horn
smiles at the sound of the music
she leaps on the record joining them
as they walk faster the music speeds up
comes up behind them
he looks deep in thought
he catches his hat as it begins to slip off his head
goes to sit down and rest sitting on a brick
heads over towards the others
but seeing s contemplative mood stops next to
looks up at him
ive been a bitter old pill havent i
looks at not sure how to respond
now also sees s old staff that is still holding onto
he looks over at
i lost sight
of many things
e looks at as though to beg his forgiveness
sits down next to him
weve both made mistakes
e looks over at the smoldering remains of the factory
whats past is past
they look at each other for a beat then look over to the others relaxing together on the victrola
holds out his hand to
gives his hand and helps him up
as stands his heavy headpiece falls off and shatters
looks in horror
but just looks at it shrugging and slightly smiling
it was always so heavy
e now runs his hand over his head which we now see has a funny looking pony tail like protuberance
hesitates then cant help chuckling
sees him then starts to laugh as well
and go over together to the victrola
notices as helps climb up on the victrola and starts to celebrate
joins near the needle and sits on the crank as it spins around
everyone is enjoying the music
discovers a trove of records enormous in scale compared to the little ragdoll
he curiously begins to go through them
he picks one out
but it rolls away from him
it rolls towards the hill and then down the hill
runs after it
behind him unseen by anyone the talisman crackles and glows slightly
sees s beginning panic and whirls to see seq
the fabrication machine breaks free running down the hillside
and suddenly the enormous fabrication machine rises up free of the factory towering over him like a giant monster
the talisman is glowing ferociously in the machines front
he tries to run towards
shrieks running back towards the others
the other ragdolls whirl and stare frozen at the hideous apparition
they leap off the spinning victrola hitting the needle and the music scratches to a halt
before anyone can get to him is snatched by the towering no
tries to run towards the machine
pulls him away frantically fiercely forcing to allow himself to be saved
theres nothing you can do
faces the machine as the green of the talisman shoots out at him sucking his soul into its portal
the machines eye turns green showing it has absorbed the soul then back to glowing red
the machine again shakes and then seems momentarily paralyzed as it ingests the soul giving the ragdolls a moment to flee scrambling desperately trying to get up the hill and
looks over to the bridge
his generals instincts kick back in
the fabrication machine powers back up and lumbers after them
the dolls head over to the bridge
the bridge o
sends and the twins across the bridge
he turns to but they dont need to speak they both understand the plan
they linger behind luring the machine
tries to drag across the bridge
the twins chatter
is moving slower than the others
grabs his arm and pulls him off the bridge
come on we cant stay here
protesting incoherenly to no
the fabrication machine lumbers up the hill
and clamber onto the bridge
get out to the center and stop
they wave their hands and weapons trying to get the machine to come to the bridge
the machine crashes onto the bridge
it lumbers ferociously after and
and struggle to get to the end of the bridge
the machine is closing in on them
they frantically struggle across the machine gets closer
and suddenly the floorboards give way under the machines enormous weight
he machine scrambles and claws at the splintering boards but falls through
t hangs on with two of its mechanical legs one on each side in the broken bridge
inexorably it begins working its way back up
and start sliding down the bridge as the beasts weight is making the bridge fall
efforts prying off the fabrication machine pry it loose
they continue prying hammering pounding at the machines legs with the steel scraps
and the twins watch with horror
and have almost managed to pry the machine loose and are about to send it plummeting to its destruction
breaks free from s hold
grasps after him trying to stop him
only grabs onto s key
runs out onto the bridge
o no you must not destroy it
he points to the talisman on the machine
we need it
they are inside
looks in puzzlement at the talisman
theres an astonished questioning look on his face
screaming at re he has to go she grabs and pushes him to the side
ou must go back
to the first room
looks at trying to understand him
the machine twists and turns
ehind him the machine begins to regain its footing
he is there
he will show you
suddenly gets a look of doomed horror on his face
come for us
his last words urgent the source
and one of the fabrication machines robotic arms grabs
goes for but cant get to him
the bridge starts to give way and run to the other side
s light staff slides and falls down into the dark crevice
the fabrication machine is now hanging off of one side of the bridge still holding on to
and flee wildly across the disintegrating bridge
they make it across to the other ragdolls at the other end of the bridge just in time
the fabrication machine tries to back up on the bridge but ends up getting caught in the beams which form a cage around him
the other ragdolls yell to from the other side of the bridge
the fabrication machine brings up to its eye
disagreement watches in horror as the machine sucks s soul
as before the machine shakes and then seems momentarily paralyzed as it ingests the soul
it then re animates
strides over to
we must destroy it
stares at him
we can see a sudden new thought is forming on his face
looks at the machine
anything can be overcome
one just needs the right weapon
we cant destroy it
you heard him come for us
theyre still inside theyre gone
i dont think so
we can get them back
i just have to figure this out
trying to parse s the first room
tries to persuade
e need to get a weapon
trying to parse s words completely focused in thought the source
he will show you
the machine screams starting to break free
turns abruptly making a decision
this raving will get us nowhere
m going to find a real weapon
turns and stalks off
the twins hesitate uncertainly
goes over to and implores him
come with us
determined certain of his path shakes his head gently
looks sad but she feels she has no choice
she ushers the twins away and they follow
the twins are carrying s key
the first room
suddenly he looks up
he gets it
the first room
return to the workshop
lose on the shutter banging in the attic workshop
is staring at it then looks around the workshop
e sees the scientist on the floor
he recognizes him
he looks up and climbs up onto the table
e sees the machine that he fell out of
he sees diagrams
he sees a journal with drawings and thoughts
the drawings include the original machine
sketches of the dolls
the diagram that we saw in the library manuscript
e looks further and sees a strip of film
curiously he picks it up and now sees its feeding into a rickety old movie projector which now turns on and we see the documentary footage that we saw being
made in the title sequence it can be the exact same footage or can be slightly altered if necessary for our uses here if we still want to hear the radio it should be mixed in very low so we are aware of it but it doesnt interfere with the scientists dialogue
this is constructed so the scientist can be in v
only until the end but if possible we can also see the back of the scientist in the first few pieces of footage
we hear the scientists voice and we realize the scientist e see first the footage of the scientist making and hear the scientist it had such promise
my first creation
we see on the table a drawing of the original machine as the scientist assembles the raw materials of
sounds of war in the b
scientists voice contd but it was taken
and bent to such evil
we see him making
scientists voice contd so little hope remains
that is why i create you
the footage crackles out then resumes
now we see the footage of the scientist making
scientists voice contd much more weakly i am unable to reverse the transfer process
my life force diminishes with each one of you
it is all right
you will thrive
tenderly he puts together
the footage crackles out then resumes
now we see the footage of the scientist making
with louder more explosive sounds of war in the b
g scientists voice contd so little hope remains
that is why i create you
n the footage we now see him putting into the strange machine putting the finishing touches on
brushing his hand across the little box
we pull out of the footage to see looking in astonishment at the flickering footage
looks over at the little box in the scientists hand in the footage and suddenly goes into a startling flashback his pov as he is suspended in the strange machine
he sees the scientist clutching the little box from the front as the scientist approaches him a look of endless love on his weakened haggard face
tenderly to directly its up to you now
with his last breath of you
you are all the pieces of my soul
the scientist puts the strange face mask on and s pov is suffused with a green glow
the talisman clicks shut the soul transfer completed
we hear the scientist fall to the ground his soul depleted
comes out of his vision
he looks over the side of the table at the dead scientist
walks to the scientist and stares at the dead man
finally realizing it you
youre the source
he reaches out to the skeletal hand clutching the box then simply touches the scientists hand tenderly
he looks up a new resolute look in his eyes
reunion runs through the wasteland looking for the others
sees the others through barbed wire
theyre carrying a large missile towards an old cannon
ducks under and hurries towards them
he hes the source
they stare at him uncomprehendingly
the one who made the machine
he gave us life too
hey stare at him
pauses at the enormity of it
he used his own soul
and the twins look at him in awe and surprise
seems strangely unmoved
thats why the machine is hunting us
it was warped reprogrammed to hunt humanity
it and the machines it made killed everything
they stare at him
were all that remains
suddenly the ground starts to shake
we hear the machine approaching
and the twins run to the missile
dont destroy it
its hunting us
itll never stop
you said it yourself
first we have to get them back
she continues loading the missile with
i have an idea
enough of your ideas
we need to load the weapon
the machine attacks
the fabrication machine appears from behind the cannon
the ragdolls are caught off guard and scramble to get away just as its claw smashes down demolishing the cannon
the dolls fly back from the blast
is the only one standing
deliberately walks towards the machine
rushes over trying to pull him away
trying to get back up stop
youre a fool
the machine swipes at with its claw
tries to stop it from getting
the machine sends her flying
she lands badly and cant get up immediately
the machine regroups then begins to re approach
it powers down right after it takes a soul
just for a few seconds
he twins chatter frantically
struggles to get up
no it doesnt
yes it does
ill let it take my soul
take the device
e points to the talisman on the machine
he stands as the machine approaches
but what if youre wrong
begging him dont do this must
the machine raises its claw to grab when suddenly is knocked aside and no
what are you doing
he tussles with but pushes him aside with surprising strength
they left us nothing
what right did they have to burden us
why did we have to right their wrongs
so i refused
i refused our path
we cannot refuse it
we are all thats left
we must complete our journey
he machine raises its claw again and grabs
looks over to
sometimes one must be sacrificed for the good of many
ith a horrible green glow the machine takes his soul
the twins look away distressed
but the machine rises up terrifyingly
it looks for a moment as though was wrong and theyre all going to be killed
they all cringe with horror
but then as had remembered the machine powers down to digest s soul
darts in and grabs the talisman
he machine with a terrible shrieking sound falters then crumples dead
sparks and smoke spew from it
oil bubbles down its sides
it is lifeless just a pile of jumbled machinery
and the twins approach and all of them look down at the talisman in s hands and we
souls released life renewed smoke rises from the center of a funeral pyre the dolls have made
t is a circular pyre with spokes reaching out from the center
at the end of each spoke is the burlap skin of one of the fallen ragdolls with its number stretched across a pole
in the center a small fire flickers
stands in front of the last pole holding s skin in his hands
he looks down at it in his hands and sadly places it upon the pole looking up towards it
he twins come in with artifacts from the scientists studio
the tiny box
they put them down to the side
and take the talisman and place it in the center in front of the fire
he talisman pulsates vibrates and shakes and finally bursts
a huge green glow reaches up to the sky and the ragdolls souls emerge
emerges and walks to his number
he nods to and the twins
they nod back acknowledging the fierce warrior
comes out with close behind
places an arm around
emerges from the talisman energy
he sees his key and caresses it
emerges and comes over to stand next to
he nods acknowledging that has finally completed the mission
he looks up to the sky
the others follow his gaze
together spirits and living they all watch together and watch as the beam shoots up to the sky
we see the sky a healing rain begins to fall
the souls of the slain ragdolls now rise and dissipate into the healing energy
puts her arm around
the twins chatter theyve taken s key and tried it in the little boxs keyhole
it opens the box
and go over as the box is opened it is a music box
as they see themselves reflected in it they see the word camera pulls back slowly
revealing a tiny tendril of green grass growing
