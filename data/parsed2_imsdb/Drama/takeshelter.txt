written by jeff nichols grove hill productions release edit draft sun spikes through the jostling leaves of a maple tree
a strong wind bends them back showing their light green bellies
this is a modest house in a row of modest houses
propane tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to be more rural than suburb
curtis laforche stands in his driveway
his eyes locked on the sky narrow as he stares at
a storm cell stretching out on the horizon in front of him
its a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and gray clouds
they swirl in and out of one another sending wispy tentacles toward the ground
curtis stands awestruck
the clouds move fast overhead
he looks up as they overtake his position
a light rain begins
the rain pats the ground
it makes soft indentions on his cotton shirt
he watches it hit the concrete falling harder now
he notices something strange
the rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk
he pulls his shirt out and sees dark spots forming there
he holds his palm out flat in front of him
the rain pools
he rubs the water through his thumb and fingers
its an amber color viscous like fresh motor oil
curtis looks to the sky the rain pelting his face now
jagged angry clouds blanketing overhead
the wind bends back the trunk of the maple tree
curtis stands alone at the base of the surging storm cell
curtis holds his head under the running shower nozzle
cool clean water rushes over his face
samantha stands at the stovetop stirring eggs in a pan
shes still dressed in her sleeping attire an oversized t shirt and pajama bottoms with cartoon frogs on them
hannah sits at the kitchen table tearing up a piece of toast and feeding it to the dog
hannah is a blonde little girl with a large hearing aid wrapped over her right ear
it clips into her hair near the back of her head
the dogs name is red a rhodesian ridgeback that appreciates the attention
curtis enters the kitchen and kisses hannah on the head
in the same motion he takes the piece of toast from her hand and sets it on her plate
takes a seat no no no
dont feed the dog darlin
hannah immediately picks the piece of toast back up and feeds it to the dog
samantha brings the pan over and spoons eggs out on everyones plates
you slept late
i need to go
what you got going today
ive got to finish up some curtains for saturday and nat and cam are coming over
with the kids
cammie said she just needed to get out of the house
samantha takes her seat at the table
tell nat to take it easy on her
curtis gets up and goes to hannah
cam can hold her own
we need to send in the deposit for the beach condo
he kneels beside his daughters chair and waits for her to make eye contact
she looks over at him
he speaks using sign language
three broad slow gestures
i love you
hannah puts her arms around his neck and he squeezes her
he stands and grabs a sack lunch off the counter
on his way out he kisses samantha on top of the head
just write the check babe
samantha sips her coffee as hannah feeds more toast to the dog
as she signs no more food
curtis shoulders his way out the front screen door
keys in his mouth and sack lunch in his hand he makes his way down the porch steps and onto the front walk
he pops open the chain link gate and heads for the pick up parked on the street
clear blue sky overhead
small soybean plants slouch in the noonday sun
a slight breeze picks up jostling the leaves but the sound is drowned out by a loud mechanical rumbling
a spiral drill churns up dark soil as it digs deeper into the ground
curtis wearing work goggles grabs hold of the drills cabling system and yanks down
yeah lets keep going with that bit
itll go another feet
he yells to dewart a big guy sitting at the controls of a diesel powered well drilling rig
the truck has a long rusted bed with metal scaffolding raised high on its back
we wont get the gravel pack down today
were gonna have to call it
curtis looks back to a potential storm
gray clouds forming across the horizon
happy hour starts at five dewart
not if its rainin
samantha sits at a table running a long piece of sheer fabric through her sewing machine
shes making curtains
nat sips a screwdriver from a clear plastic cup designed not to sweat
shes a woman with rough edges
cammie cradles a brown haired baby on top of her pregnant eight month belly
as nat speaks she looks out a sliding glass door at her two kids dj and sue playing with hannah
they were just drinkin and laughin and oh my god
it was like i was bein in a museum and i saw the progress from apes to men
i saw it
i saw the future
dewart that was him
that was going to be him in years
oh my god
let me tell you you laugh
but this little one in your arms is gonna be shufflin in a bar just like em
samantha jumps up from her sewing to see outside
hannah with her back to the house bangs a x with a rusted nail in the end into the ground
samantha is out the door
samantha walks briskly talking to the other children
you guys okay
samantha takes a wide line around hannah who continues banging the two by four into the ground
as soon as the child sees her mother she stops
samantha crouches in front of hannah gently taking the board away from her
samantha signs with her hand and speaks at the same time
hannah tilts her head looking off to the side
samantha touches her chin bringing her eyes back around
signing and speaking you understand
hannah nods once yes
samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the back corner of the yard
a storm shelter is buried in the ground just behind the pile
its a grass covered mound with two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky
she throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on her pants
staring at the pile she lets out an irritated sigh
thunder rumbles low in the distance
she looks up at the approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks back inside
bring the girls inside
the drill bit spins as rain pelts the ground turning the dark soil into black mud
curtis holds a rain slicker over his head
he watches as the hole they are drilling fills up with brown water
he lifts his boot which makes a sucking sound as it dislodges from the mud
looking at the horizon he sees no sign of the storm letting up
he looks to dewart who smiles at him from behind the controls of the rig
its not my fault
i told you
im callin it
shut it down
dewart gladly eases back on the lever at his knee
samantha holds the front door open as nat and cammie leave with their children packed up and in tow
its raining pretty hard outside
thanks for coming over
ill call next week about the lions club supper
running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat
samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house
the rain outside is the only noise
she heads to the kitchen
hannah is sitting indian style at the glass doors watching the rain
samantha walks over and kneels down behind her
she wraps her arms around hannah who lifts a hand to the glass
can you sign s t o r m
samantha puts her hand onto the glass next to hannahs and signs s t o r m
hannah turns to see her mothers face and samantha uses both hands to make the signed symbol
fingers spread and bent moved downward
hannah looks back out the window
they watch the storm together
the blue top of a small cooler is knocked to the floorboard as dewart fishes the last busch tallboy out of icy water
he cracks it open and takes an extended sip
curtis sitting behind the wheel of his truck looks at his drunk friend
i gotta get home
nat and me been lookin into a threesome
weve been chattin with a girl online from canton
big ol girl
shes about two fifty two seventy five
she cant be no taller than foot
dewart starts laughing which makes curtis laugh
the laughing subsides
i dont see me and sam gettin into somethin like that
i dont guess you would
dewart is staring at curtis
you got a good life curtis
i think thats the best compliment you can give a man take a look at his life and say thats good
that guys doin somethin right
it aint always so easy
hell i know that
dewart sees something out his window
i gotta go
nat in a house robe and slippers weaves her way through the maze of junk on their front lawn
dewart passes her without saying a word
curtis watches as she follows him inside the house still talking
he shifts into drive and pulls away
the lights are out and the house is quiet
curtis eases open the front door and steps inside
standing on the door mat he slips off his mud caked boots and gently sets them aside
curtis places his palm flat on the door and lets it open
hannah is curled up with the covers
he watches her sleep
samantha barefoot and wearing a sleep shirt walks up behind curtis
he turns his head when she approaches
she wraps her arms around his waist and he lifts his elbow to make room for her
she do all right today
she was fine
shes still not playin with the others though
she cant connect
honey you gotta clean up that trash pile in the back
she fished out a board that had nails on it
ill get to it this weekend
its quiet for a moment
i still take off my boots so i wont wake her up
she smiles up at her husband
i still whisper
he pulls her tight
they stand together in the doorway
the house is silent
curtis loads pieces from the trash pile into a wheelbarrow
he keeps an eye on hannah as she jumps on a small plastic playscape in the middle of the backyard
the dog red paces by the back door
hes agitated but his movement is limited by the length of rope tied from his collar to a nearby post
curtis flinches at the loud boom
he looks to the sky and sees dark clouds twisting overhead
hannah plays unaffected by the noise
to get a better view curtis moves from beneath a tree in the corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmland that runs up to his property
chain link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concrete culvert that leads out to the open field
a giant storm cell gathers force on the horizon there
red barks incessantly
he winces and strains against the rope tied to his collar
curtis flinches again as a bolt of lightning streaks to the ground in the distance
sparks shoot into the air leaving a circle of scorched crops
another crack of thunder
a light rain begins
red snaps his head around and bucks into the air
he gnashes at the rope
curtis collects hannah off the playscape and turns back to the approaching storm cell
he holds up his hand and studies the falling rain
its the thick amber colored liquid
with hannah in his arms curtis watches awestruck as wispy tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of three tornados out in the field
behind them reds teeth fray the rope at his collar
he thrashes his head the rope snaps and the dog flies toward curtis and hannah
curtis turns to see red charging them
he barely has time to set hannah down before red catches him by the forearm
they crash to the ground tangled together
rain coming down hard now
curtis yells and waves hannah back
red snapping buries his teeth into the muscles in curtis arm
blood streams from the wound
curtis screams in pain
curtis bolts up in bed grabbing his forearm
he grinds his teeth and doubles over in pain
it takes a moment for him to find his bearings
his breathing slows
he gently rubs his hand over the skin on his arm
sweat has collected around his collar and temples
from the bed sheets in a twisted mess he looks around the room unsure of what just happened to him
eggs cool on a plate
curtis sits at the kitchen table dressed for work
he stares vacantly at his breakfast
he looks up at hannah
she sits on the floor surrounded by toy building blocks and plays with the dog
she rubs under reds chest and in turn he licks her face
she smiles and gently pushes him away
samantha sits with her knees up drinking coffee
did you hear me
you got to be home showered ready to walk out the door by six tonight
curtis stands up and goes over to hannah
he grabs her off the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying
i just want her to eat her breakfast and stop playin with the damn dog
shes fine down there
she had toast already
curtis against flailing manages to get hannah in her chair
curtis backs off frustrated
hannah climbs down from her chair and goes back to the floor and the dog
he stops and checks his watch
you didnt eat anything
curtis is gone
samantha looks at hannah on the floor with the dog
the main headquarters of delta agri pro is housed in a giant metal building
a row of cheaply built s style offices with drop tile ceilings line the left of a large warehouse that contains all manner of agricultural and construction equipment
tractors backhoes welding rigs etc
a group of men many of which were represented at gators bar yesterday sit in folding chairs or stand in a semi circle around jim thompson
he speaks clipboard in hand
i didnt say you had control over the weather russell what i did say was that the top shelf has to be cleared by the th
thats non negotiable
dewart eats from a bag of sunflower seeds
curtis stares down at his forearm
he rubs the skin there
jim runs a finger down his clipboard
where we at on that east nd site
curtis snaps his head up takes a second
yesterday slowed us down
we couldnt get the second pilot hole drilled
jim drops his head and the clipboard falls to his side
a melodramatic move
it rained for two hours yesterday
two hours and our entire schedule went in the toilet
we lose the permit if youre not out of there by end of day
end of day curtis
valerie tells me that the father son pancake cook off
curtis and dewart walk to curtis truck
hey i gotta make a stop before we head out there
think we got time
dewart stands by a flatbed cart with a prefab doghouse sitting on it
curtis loads chain link fencing materials onto the cart
the wheels of the well drilling rig are half sunk into the muddy soil
curtis stands over the hole being drilled
the turning metal pole suddenly seizes up and stops
smoke begins to seep up from the hole
dewart jumps down from the control panel to take a look
we stripped that bit
well bring it up
we gotta re set it
dewart walks back to his controls
curtis heads to the cab of the drilling rig and checks his watch
something catches his eye in the distance
clearing past the rig he walks out into the adjacent field
he removes his goggles eyes fixed on the acres of farmland that stretch for miles in front of him
in the sky overhead
hundreds of them make up a black swarm that twists and shifts in the air
they dive bomb then ascend in intricate geometric patterns
curtis watches mesmerized
dewart strains a wrench against a bolt as the drill screeches in reverse
curtis acknowledges dewart but cant take his eyes off the pattern of birds
they shrink and stretch from thick clumps to long cylindrical tubes
curtis reluctantly heads back to the rig which is shrieking with the sound of metal on metal
you ever see birds fly like that
holding his hand to his what
curtis looks back giving the birds a final review
the sun has just set adding a purple hue to the sky
curtis steers his truck up to the front curb of his house
he sees samantha standing by her car the back door open
she watches him pull up
hannah is already packed into her car seat
curtis climbs out and walks to the driveway
come on we gotta go
i could really use a shower
samantha isnt having it
she climbs in the passenger seat
curtis makes his way to her car
curtis work boots are encased in dry mud
chunks have broken off and pepper the thin blue industrial carpet
his mud stained fingers tap on the top of a desk
dirt caked under his nails
so if you continue with the basic vocabulary this will allow you to communicate with your children better
curtis sits filthy at a school desk he doesnt quite fit into
a teacher speaks to a room full of parents
between the ages of four and seven the focus is more on the sign and then later well begin adding the alphabet as more of a support syster
now in asl
curtis looks over at samantha who is sitting in the desk next to him
she wont look at him
he cranes his neck around to see toward the back of the room
an assistant teacher sits on a large colorful rug with a group of children all different ages playing games that teach hand signs
hannah actively participates in the group
the male sign is signed at the forehead area
for example father is signed up here like this
father very good
curtis turns back in his chair and makes the sign for dad along with the other parents
curtis samantha and hannah sit on the floor in a circle atop the colored rug
samantha turns over large flashcards with illustrated scenes on them
they take turns making the corresponding sign
curtis stares at samantha but shes still giving him the cold shoulder
finally while holding up a card she looks at him
he signs im sorry
a fist moving in a circular motion at his chest
youre not sorry
i am sorry
she looks to hannah and signs swim
well you stink
you smell really bad
i think i smell good
she smiles begrudgingly and then signs to hannah dad and stink
curtis turns to some ladies behind him
do i smell good
samantha laughs and tries to cover his mouth with her hand
maybe i should marry her instead
they continue to laugh
curtis slams the door to his truck sealing him off from the torrential rainfall outside
he shakes water off wipes his face
the windows are smeared by thick dark rain
its hard to see out
he looks over to hannah sitting in her car seat
it looks odd on the front bench of the truck
he signs to her
signing and speaking you okay
he cranks the truck and turns on the wipers
the liquid on the windshield streaks into long smudges
curtis leans forward to get a better view of the street
he checks his blind spot and pulls away
stop lights blur into hazy red and green spheres
curtis checks the rearview but the back window is covered by the rain
he tries rolling down his window but water blows in
he rolls it back up and the smudging gets worse
the truck shimmies from left to right pushed by the wind
a thunder strike rattles
suddenly curtis stomps on the brakes and turns the wheel
the truck hydroplanes
curtis head busts against the steering column
the front windshield cracks as the truck jerks to a stop
the hiss of a broken radiator
curtis winces from the blow to his head
hannah is crying
he reaches over to her
are you okay
hannah physically looks all right but she continues crying
curtis reaches out and places a hand on her head
hes dazed mumbling
the truck is angled up slightly like the front end has inched up a pole
a cut on his forehead has begun to bleed
he sees movement
a person passes by the hazy side window
a shape moves past the drivers window
the truck shifts as weight is added to the bed
the sound of someone pulling things from the back of the truck
curtis flinches as a x pounds the windshield
the truck jostles from the weight of someone jumping on the hood
the roof caves in with two footsteps
curtis looks around frantically
he reaches over to hannah and begins to unstrap her from the car seat
a board breaks through the passenger window
a woman pale and aggressive stands in the rain storm staring through the broken glass
she reaches for the lock
curtis pulls hannah from the child seat and recoils against his door but is jolted as another board crashes through the drivers window
a hand yanks curtis by his collar
hes pulled against the door
a pasty forearm wraps around his neck choking him
he strains against the arm
needing to breath
the woman at the passenger door grabs for hannah
curtis kicks at her
a mans boot kicks out the back window
the man in the bed of the truck reaches for curtis face
he flails and kicks unable to break free from the forearm at his door
the woman gets hold of hannah
the child is yanked from curtis arms
hands claw at curtis face
the woman has disappeared into the storm with hannah
fingers swoop into his open mouth grabbing hold of his cheek
they pull the cheek back
he yells in pain
samantha walks down the hallway holding hannahs shoes
hannah trails behind her
put on your shoes samantha walks in
curtis is standing at the counter in his undershirt and boxers pouring a cup of coffee
good youre up
curtis doesnt turn to greet her
he just stirs a spoon in the black coffee
samantha walks up to him and puts a hand on his back
she notices that his shirt is soaked with sweat
honey youre soaked
he turns taking a sip from the mug
she feels his forehead
are you sick
ive felt better
i guess we could stay home if we need to
where you goin
its saturday i was going to take hannah to my booth
curtis walks to the table and takes a seat
you look really sick honey
im all right
its just a cold or somethin
let me get you some advil
she heads for the hallway
dont worry about it
yall just go
ill be fine
holds up the mug better already
samantha walks to her purse on the counter and roots through to find a set of keys
i got my phone if you need anything
dont forget sunday lunch is here tomorrow
this reminder makes curtis rub his face with a grunt
if youre sick we should cancel
ill be all right
okay well talk later
she heads for the door with hannah
samantha scoops up her bag and takes hannah by the hand
they leave the room
curtis notices the dog red sitting on his haunches looking at him
curtis stares back sipping his coffee
the reverse lights shine as curtis pick up rumbles backward
curtis eyes the side mirror as he maneuvers the truck into his backyard
in the mirror the trash pile comes into view
just behind it the storm shelter doors appear
the truck shutters to a stop
curtis studies the shelter in the side mirror for a moment
a grassy bulge with angled metal doors peeking over the trash heap
he climbs out
a blue tarp is pulled from the bed of the truck floating down to the yard
curtis slips on a pair of work gloves and continues to eye the storm shelter
he yanks a bale of chain link from the bed of the truck and carries it to the back corner of the yard
he steals another glance back toward the shelter
dropping the bale he sizes up the space
he looks to the sky
its a beautiful day
he begins counting off steps from the back fence line
a linen sheet floats down over a folding table
the hanging bag is placed on a portable clothes rod
hands place an assortment of home sewn crafts like napkins and embroidered pillows out onto the table
a tackle box is opened revealing a tray of small bills and change
a calculator is removed
hannah kneels in front of a folding chair behind their booth at an open air flea market
she uses the seat of the chair as a table for a tiny porcelain tea set
samantha stands over her display table smiling and nodding at perusing customers
a mallet drives tall metal stakes into the ground
the cord holding together the bale of chain link is snipped and a boot rolls the fencing out flat
chain link is attached to the stakes with a number of metal braids
the prefab doghouse is set down in the back corner
curtis stands in front of his newly created dog pen
its waist high and about x tucked in the back left corner of the yard so that half of the pen is made up by the existing fencing
samantha turns to see a large woman holding up an intricately embroidered pillow
you can tell by the look of her that shes a flea market pro a bargain hunter
how much you asking for this pillow
this pillows fifteen dollars
thats more than i want to spend
this is all hand stitched
it takes a really long time
thats why i charge that
ill give you seven for it
samantha looks at the woman who is almost daring her
i cant go that low
well thats my offer
the woman sets down the pillow and begins looking over other items on the table
samantha bites the inside of her cheek
she doesnt like to haggle
the woman doesnt look up
ill give you eight but its in change
samantha forces a smile and motions to hannah
the woman smiles and removes a ziplock bag of assorted coins from her purse
hannah takes the bag
lucky for you she likes to count change
hannah opens the bag and begins to turn it over
curtis unlatches a piece of the braided wire holding a separated section of fencing that acts like a gate
he opens it and looks down at red who sits at his feet
he speaks gently to the dog
red walks into the pen
curtis closes the gate kneels and places his hands on the fence
red approaches so that his nose is touching curtis fingers
curtis scratches him
im sorry about this buddy
we just gotta work it like this for awhile okay
curtis stands wiping his hands off on his jeans
he sees the storm shelter poking up from behind the trash pile
he looks down at red
curtis walks to the shelter
clearing past the trash pile the shelter appears the mound fully visible
curtis stops at the angled doors
he studies them
a rusted padlock is snapped shut across the handles
he reaches out and lifts up the padlock
he yanks on it then lets it fall
coins splash across the kitchen counter
curtis sets an empty coffee can back on the shelf in front of him and begins sifting through the change
odd screws buttons then he gets to what hes looking for
a small set of brass keys on a matching ring
he grabs the keys from the pile and exits
curtis walks back out to the storm shelter keys in hand long flashlight in his back pocket
he pulls up the padlock that holds the two rusted doors together
popping off the rubber cover he tries a key
the lock pops up
he unhooks it from the doors and lets it fall to the ground
curtis strains to pull the first door open
its heavy and sticks from lack of use
finally with a creak the door swings back
curtis holds his head to the side a musty odor coming from inside
he forces the second door open
curtis stands in front of the shelter a gaping black hole angled up from the earth
he takes the flashlight from his pocket and turns it on
it illuminates concrete steps leading down
the dog nose at the fence watches from his pen on the other side of the yard
curtis enters the shelter
its pitch black inside
curtis makes his way down the steps and holds out the flashlight
an assortment of trash on the ground empty cans and water bottles some candy wrappers
the whole shelter is only about x
his head fits fine but he still ducks like he might bump it
he shines the light on the back wall
a rotted wooden bench is bolted into the concrete there
curtis walks to it and takes a seat
hes looking back toward the steps now
a shaft of light cuts a strict beam through the open doors lighting only the concrete entry
curtis takes in the quiet of the concrete box
he leans his head back on the wall and closes his eyes
he shuts off his flashlight
left in the dark he takes a deep breath
while rescue workers made several attempts to reach the family walter jacobs wife
curtis sits in his lazyboy bent over a frozen dinner
he watches the local news on tv
samantha walks in with a glass of milk and some oreos a magazine tucked under her arm
samantha takes a tin down from the top of the fridge
it has designs of starfish and other ocean creatures on it
she sets the tin on the counter next to the tackle box she uses as a cash register and yells to curtis in the den
but thats what i dont understand
if he didnt do anything why did you put him out back
samantha counts out the money earned at the flea market
she sets a portion aside and closes the tackle box
curtis says something but its inaudible
she opens the tin and removes an envelope with the word beach written on it in black sharpie
samantha adds the money to the envelope and puts up the jar
she opens the fridge and takes out the milk
you hear me
i said if he didnt do anything why did you have to put him outside
curtis attention is on the tv
samantha sits on the couch
i just wanted him to be outside for awhile
hes your dog
hes always been an inside dog
hes my dog and thats why hes outside
right now with hannah and everything i just think itd be better
hannah loves red
curtis stares at the television program
samanthas eyes narrow
frustrated she flips open her magazine
the gas cloud spread across their six acre property
the only way off their land was across the train tracks which were blocked by wreckage
from a hospital bed i tried using some wet rags and towels to breathe through but that just seemed to make it worse
while rescue workers made several attempts to reach the family walter jacobs wife and brother in law died in the home
jacobs survived despite enduring eleven hours of exposure to the gas cloud before finally being flown out by helicopter
you hearin this
her nose still in the magazine
no way out
samantha shakes her head
curtis watches the footage of walter jacobs
he watches his red rimmed eyes
the deep lines in his face
its daytime but the house feels dark from the storm blowing outside
the sound of rain pelts the windows and roof
curtis dressed for work walks from his bedroom down the hallway
he passes the den and stops at its entryway
hannah sits on the couch with her back to him
shes on her knees looking out one of the front windows
a dull orange glow halos from the bank of windows
what sunlight there is appears diffused by the dark thick rain smearing down the outside of the glass
he shows concern as heavier rain begins battering the house
the wind picks up making wood beams creak on their foundation
hannah doesnt move
she continues staring out the window
the sound of the storm outside intensifies
windows begin to rattle in their frames
curtis walks over and reaches for hannah but is startled by the sight of a mans face just outside the window
hannah and the man have been staring at one another
the man hollow eyed and pale moves out of the window and out of sight
thunder cracks overhead
curtis scoops hannah into his arms and heads out of the room
the front door rattles
curtis stops and turns back
the sound of someone kicking at the front door
the storm outside has grown to a deafening pitch
the power goes out
the entire house vibrates like a freight train running across the roof
the banging at the front door continues frame giving way as the storm reaches its apex
curtis holding hannah kneels and braces himself in the entryway to the den
he covers the back of hannahs head with his hands and squeezes her tight into his shoulder
the rain stops
no more banging at the front door
the sun moves brightly though the front windows
the furniture in the den lifts off the ground
a couch lazyboy coffee table and lamp
it all hangs in the air floating for a moment
curtis watches eyes wide
the sunlight vanishes
the sound of the storm is sucked back into the room as the furniture crashes to the floor breaking apart on impact
the windows blow out
curtis squeezes his eyes shut and pivots his body trying to protect hannah
shards of glass splinter across his face
curtis gasps for air
it doesnt come
hes sucking for a breath
he rises up in bed gasping
his face flushed and head soaked in sweat
his eyes dart around the room frantically searching his surroundings
one more gasp and air enters his lungs
long deep breaths
hes calming down
his breathing comes under control
his attention turns to something else
something under the sheets
curtis pulls back the bed sheets
the mattress is soaked in yellow urine
this scares him
his hand trembles as he reaches out to touch his wet boxers
the toilet flushes
footsteps in heels
curtis quickly pulls the covers back up
samantha enters the bedroom
she pulls her hair into a tight ponytail and picks earrings off a nearby dresser her back to curtis
you got the number for dr
youre still not feeling good
yeah but you got the number
uh yeah baby but hell be closed today
she approaches the bed and he holds his hand out
ill call tomorrow
honey if youre not feeling good we take you in somewhere
she walks closer to the bed
shes taken aback
do you want me to cancel lunch today
what is that
its just i got a sore throat
im sorry im taking it out on you
i was gonna leave hannah with you so i could go to church but im not going to with you like this
ill be fine
she needs breakfast
ive got it
im sorry that you feel bad but you need to drop the attitude
whats wrong with you
im sorry im sorry
hannahs in the den
we have cereal for her
samantha stomps out of the room
he halfway lifts the sheet then lets it fall again
curtis strips the sheets off the bed
the laundry room is a stackable set squeezed into a closet off the hallway
curtis loads the sheets into the washer and presses start
watching the clothes spin a thought
curtis pushes hannahs shoe onto her foot
he stops with the shoes to concentrate
he moves his index finger from one shoulder to the other and speaks
were going out
confused she slices her finger down an open palm
with open palms were going out
curtis leads hannah up the front walk of the grafton public library
its a one story brick building with s architecture
the parking lot is nearly empty behind them
curtis holds the glass front door open for hannah
they stop in the entryway and survey the library
there are only a few people one of which is the librarian sitting behind a central desk
it is an open room with cinder block walls painted in brightly colored shapes
curtis finds the childrens section to the left and leads hannah over
she takes a seat at a kids size table as curtis grabs a dinosaur book from a nearby display
kneeling in front of her curtis shows her the book and motions with open hands to the ground
you stay put okay
hannah begins looking through the book
curtis stands he sees a set of computers under a sign reading catalogue
curtis takes a seat in front of one of the two computers set up on a folding table
he eyes the search screen
title author subject
he clicks on subject and types the word dreams
he scrolls through a list of titles and writes down a number
he looks back for hannah
shes still flipping through her book
no one else is around
he begins another search
he types mental illness
curtis scans the spines looking for his title
he already holds two books against his chest
he pulls out a thick hard cover book
the title reads understanding mental illness
hannah is once again strapped into her car seat
she holds a big childrens book in her hands
they pass a grocery store
curtis turns as it goes by
the truck pulls a u turn in the street and heads for the store parking lot
curtis pushes a cart down the aisle
hannah rides in the fold down metal seat
they stop at the bottled water section
curtis loads several plastic gallon jugs of water into his cart
the cart is filled with an assortment of supplies batteries canned food first aid supplies matches
samantha sits in the dining room at a fully dressed table
steam rises off bowls of mashed potatoes and green beans
fried chicken piled on a platter
melvin taps his finger on the empty plate in front of him and subtly checks his watch
janine smooths out the embroidered table cloth
kathryn and charlie tend to their child rex
rex repeatedly jams a finger into the potatoes
lets just start
lets all join hands for the blessing
the sound of the front door opening
samantha gets up and leaves the room
curtis has hannah in his arms
he closes the door
samantha appears behind them
she speaks in a hushed angry voice
where the hell have you been
i had to run an errand
youre really late
you didnt even bring your cell phone
samantha heads back to the dining room
curtis sucks his teeth
potatoes dalloped chicken passed the table is active with the family serving and eating
curtis watches it all somehow separated from it
missed you at church this mornin curtis
he knows what to do if he wants me to stop askin
curtis looks at him
was it a good service
it was good work
the family in front of him eats the meal
im thinking about cleaning up that storm shelter out back
they look at him
light from the open closet door cuts a shape in the relatively dark hallway
curtis roots through the back of the closet
curtis sweeps the concrete floor of the storm shelter
a coleman camping lantern sits on the wooden bench attached to the back wall
it casts an odd light up into the room
curtis places cans of food onto metal shelves
curtis flips through keys on his key ring
he adds the two small padlock keys to the ring
samantha sits on the bed in her pajamas applying lotion to her legs
she wipes the remainder on her knuckles and looks at the empty spot on curtis side of the bed
samantha walks into the kitchen and turns off the overhead light
she pauses seeing something in the backyard
she stops at the back door and stares out at the storm shelter
the camp lanterns orange light glows through the open metal doors
she watches for a moment
the shelter has been cleaned up
the metal shelves hold canned food water jugs and first aid supplies
blankets and pillows are stacked on the other side of the room
curtis sits in the back corner of the shelter on the wooden bench
he flips through one of the books from the library
the cover reads dream analysis and interpretation
the book on mental illness sits by his feet
the doctors office is a converted one story residential house
curtis slouches in a faux leather chair grouped in the small reception area
he has nodded off
his head snaps up
he sucks air through his nose and sits up in his chair
he sees a woman reading a childrens book aloud to her daughter on a colorful rug in the corner
a door opens and a nurse with a clipboard steps out
curtis stands and follows the nurse out of the room
curtis sits fully clothed on the edge of a paper covered bench in the exam room
doctor shannan an older man with a smokers voice enters smiling and gives a firm handshake
curtis how you doin bud
hows my girl
the doctor turns to a small table in the corner and grabs a wooden tongue depressor and an otoscope from a drawer
thats good to hear
tilt your head back for me
the doctor shines the otoscope into his nostrils
i dont have a cold
the doctor pauses and turns to check a chart on the table
did she get that down wrong
no i just told her that
so whats the problem
ive been havin
ive been having some trouble sleepin
i was hopin you could give me somethin for it
doctor shannan takes a seat on a rolling stool and processes the request
how longs this been goin on
bout four nights now
youre not sleepin at all
well some but real restless
well i think four nights is a little too soon to tell
my advice would be to not eat or drink anything after oclock at night
cut back on any alcoholic drinks tobacco caffeine
get some daily exercise
well i think
curtis isnt sure how much he wants to say
i think i may need to try some medication
why do you say that
the reason ive been having trouble sleeping is because of some dreams ive been havin
i didnt think it was anything at first but then the other day i woke up and the bed was wet
you urinated in your bed
couple days before that i had a dream that my dog attacked me and it took all day for the pain in my arm to go away
doctor shannan leans his back against the table and thinks about this
you been to see your mother lately
he swivels the stool around and writes on a prescription pad
its been about a month
he tears two sheets off and holds the first out to curtis
this is a prescription for a pretty mild sedative
its non habit forming but im only giving you enough for a few days anyway
take it and see if it helps
in the meantime holds up the other slip this is the number of a good friend of mine in columbus
hes a psychiatrist
its a drive but hes the best i know
ill give him a call and let him know youll be down to see him
the construction site sits in the middle of open farmland but is considerably more involved than curtis last job site
dump trucks backhoes and cement mixers roll and beep across muddy ground
a man crew operates throughout
dewart pushes down a lever that activates the hydraulic lift for the drill
curtis appears behind him
what you say curtis
curtis kneels at the ground beside the rig
sifts dirt through his fingers
they want us to get a pilot hole drilled by lunch
i figure worse comes to worse we can eat on the rig
yeah well get it done
weekend all right
same old shit
the men sit around in different groups eating out of bagged lunches
curtis eats a sandwich and watches the men
wind blows through a wooded area nearby
he watches the leaves move
he looks to the sky
its a beautiful day
the insurance office sits in a row of small downtown buildings
i need the name of the specialist whose diagnosis youll accept
an insurance agent sits behind her desk with the phone to her ear
shes an older woman wearing a pant suit
samantha sits by a fake plant and sips a coke
she watches hannah play with building blocks from a plastic tub provided by the office
into the phone no
ive told you this twice
just get me the name and or the approval code
the agent writes something down
into the phone all right
and the phone
thank you very much
the agent hangs up the phone and rips a piece of paper from the pad in front of her
she hands it to samantha
this is the name and number of the specialist who the insurance company approves of
just call and make an appointment
now if this doctor signs off you should have the implant procedure fully covered
im sorry it took so long
samantha looks at the paper impressed
can i give you a hug
you know your husbands company actually has very good insurance when it kicks in
not a lot of jobs offer policies half as good
youre very lucky
curtis stands in line at the pharmacy located in the back corner of the grocery store
he approaches the counter and hands over his prescription to a female pharmacist
she disappears behind a divider as curtis removes his wallet
he takes out an insurance card and runs his thumb over the bills
the pharmacist returns with a stapled white bag
curtis holds out the insurance card
we have your insurance on file
whats the co pay
that is your co pay
curtis studies the small paper sack and removes three dollar bills from his wallet
curtis enters the front door closing it behind him
he turns and is met by samantha who wraps her arms around him
she squeezes him
then kisses him
i love you
i love you too
i have good news
curtis finishes off a dinner of roast and potatoes
samantha sets the piece of paper the insurance agent gave her in front of him and begins clearing the table
hannah draws on a piece of construction paper at the other end of the table
samantha picks up a crayon and shows it to hannah
how bout a red
she pretends to use the crayon as lipstick
it was like talking to a sane person for once
she made one phone call
ive been trying that number for weeks
hannah doesnt look up
he stands and goes over to her
touches her shoulder and kneels beside her
were gonna get you some help
curtis touches his finger to her chest then stops
he cant think of the sign
he turns to samantha
how do you say
samantha shows him the sign
he kisses her on the forehead
he picks up a crayon and holds it up to her lips like lipstick
now i got to do you
samantha lies under the covers looking at a real estate magazine
curtis takes off his clothes by the dresser
he subtly removes a prescription bottle from his pants pocket and cups it in his palm
look at this one
its a and it sits directly on the beach
wouldnt that be great
we wouldnt have to worry about hannah crossing traffic
curtis walks over and leans in to see the page
they are rental photos of beach condos
whats the rent
eight ninety nine a week
that sounds real nice
samantha keeps flipping through the magazine as curtis heads to the bathroom
curtis turns the water on in the sink and shakes two pills from the orange bottle
he stuffs them in his mouth and chases it with water from the faucet
curtis looks at himself in the mirror for a moment before cutting out the light
a crack in the ceiling slowly comes into focus
curtis sits up in bed rubbing his eyes
he looks around the room
he hears samantha in the kitchen
he takes a deep breath smelling the breakfast cooking
curtis sits at the kitchen table as samantha dishes up some eggs
you sleep well
you look like youre feeling better
curtis nods and eats his breakfast
curtis and dewart attach a drill bit to the rig
you want me to come there and do it for you
curtis steadies the large metal piece as dewart ratchets it down
hey how much food do you think youd need to live on for a week
what do you mean
i mean to stay alive
what do you think youd need
not a lot
i dont know
you hear about people livin for days all the time offa bark and melted snow
ive never heard of that
shit i dont know
you asked the question
its on there
curtis steps back from the arm of the drill
dewart taps the wrench on two bolts to make sure they are secure
curtis flinches at the sound
curtis turns around and checks the sky
its clear blue
not a cloud in sight
it sounds like thunder
what sounds like thunder
curtis doesnt move
he watches dewart walk to the controls of the drilling rig
curtis steps back from the rig and checks the horizons
its a beautiful day
dewart looks down at him
curtis face is pale scared
curtis looks at him
not sure what to say
curtis turns and walks to his truck
where you goin
where you goin
curtis stops and rests his hands on the bed of the truck
another thunder strike makes him flinch
curtis vomits next to the back tire
he quickly stands wiping his mouth
he checks over his shoulders to see if anyone has seen him
curtis studies his face in the rearview mirror as he sails down the rural highway
he rubs his eyes with the back of his hand and looks in the side mirror
the horizon is still clear
curtis begins to hyperventilate
short breaths accompanied by cold sweat
he cant breath
the truck tires slide on the gravel shoulder as he abruptly slams on the brakes and steers off the highway
dust settles outside as curtis begins to get his breathing under control
he rests his head on the steering wheel and shuts his eyes tight
everything quiets down
no more thunder
curtis looks out his passenger window
his truck has stopped in front of a tractor trailer depot
a rusted shipping container with giant white letters painted on it reads containers for sale
curtis stares at this
he climbs out of the truck
curtis walks around his truck to get a better look at the depot
the dirt lot is piled high with containers
he studies the for sale sign then a smaller sign next to it that lists available sizes
curtis turns back to his truck and rubs his face still shaking things off
he looks up at the sky
clear and blue
a thought comes to him
he checks his watch
curtis drives down a divided four lane interstate
curtis truck pulls into the parking lot of the pleasant grove apartments
its a well manicured new construction facility
the words an assisted living community are written under the apartment name on the sign out front
curtis stands by the door for apartment in an interior carpeted hallway
a passing attendant guides an elderly woman down the hallway
curtis nods to them
the door opens
sarah a plainly dressed woman much too young to live in a nursing home looks surprised
her eyes light up and she wraps her arms around curtis
she leads him inside
the apartment is small but nicely kept
not much furniture or personal trappings
framed family photos mostly
im going to get some water
he fills his glass at the sink
takes a sip
you want some
curtis enters the living area as sarah stops in the kitchenette
sarah runs her fingers around the bent edges of a small photo of hannah
isnt she lovely
curtis drops his head
he looks uncomfortable
i need to ask you somethin
she looks at him
do you remember what year we brought you up here
to the first place
she has to think about it
because kyle was going to be a senior
can you remember what happened before you got diagnosed
what do you mean
i just want to know how it all started
before you had to leave
sarah settles in her chair understanding the question
oh i dont know
i remember it was a real stressful time
your father was gone a lot and i couldnt handle things on my own
did you ever have any dreams
like bad dreams
nothing like that
there was always
searches for the words there was always a panic that took hold of me
i thought people were watching me or listening to me
sarah is remembering
her face draws tight frustrated
its all right
its all right
sarah looks up and smiles
her focus shifts back to her son
are you okay
sarah looks back down to hannahs photo
the relatively new gas station sits just off the interstate
curtis stands at the pump filling up his truck
he watches the numbers next to the dollar sign roll higher
he looks back at the busy freeway
the pump stops
the final amount reads
he hangs the hose back onto the pump and pulls a cell phone from his pocket
he dials and waits
into the phone may i have the number for doctor george shannan
curtis phone still at his ear turns and watches the horizon
the sun hangs low in the sky
a reddish haze
into the phone hi is doctor shannan there
may i speak with him
this is curtis laforche
sorry to call you at home i just dont think i can make it to columbus to see that psychiatrist
yeah its just too far
is there somewhere local you can send me
curtis steps quietly into the bedroom
the lights are on but samantha has fallen asleep on top of the made bed
he empties his pockets on the dresser and samantha wakes up
sorry i woke you up
where you been
i went to see mom
samantha sits up in the bed
is she okay
i just wanted to check up on her
you shoulda told me we would have gone with you
samantha lays back down tucking herself under the covers
come to bed
i will in a bit
curtis finishes emptying his pockets
hannah sleeps soundly in her bed
curtis stands at the door watching her
he walks over and takes a seat on the edge of the bed
he listens to her breath
the backyard is almost pitch black
curtis stands in front of the storm shelter doors holding out the coleman lantern
he surveys the backyard with it
the trash pile has been removed leaving the yard more open
curtis begins to count steps out from the left edge of the shelter doors
he counts to himself three feet per stride
he begins to outline a rectangle
the house is quiet and the den is lit by a single lamp
curtis sits alone on the couch hunched over the coffee table
he writes on a yellow legal pad
its a list with the heading remodel
it reads shipping container plumbing and waste bobcat jackhammer with pneumatics sealant dirt at the bottom of the list curtis writes the figure and circles it
he studies the number then begins drawing a rectangular diagram below it
curtis blows into a styrofoam cup and stares through the blinds of an office window
outside a flag snaps at the top of a pole next to the first national bank sign
he looks down at a newspaper laid out on an end table next to him
he flips it over and studies the ads on the back
a big one in the corner catches his eye
it reads cuyahoga gun and knife show
the ad lists items for sell trade
tactical gear gas masks batons
curtis focuses in on the words gas masks and tears the ad out
john myers enters with a set of papers in his hand
curtis quickly tucks the ad into his back pocket
myers takes a seat in one of two chairs in front of his desk and looks over the papers
he takes a pen out of his pocket as curtis sits down next to him
well youve kept up with the payments on the house
weve been good about that
myers nods but he carries a look of concern
i gotta tell you curtis banks arent loaning money the way they used to
weve got you a loan today but the interest rates are variable and we have to tie it to your house
myers sits back drawing the pen to his lips and tapping it
curtis ive known you a long time
we financed your house for you two vehicles
im telling you this is a risky loan youre taking
i need the money john
myers nods then leans forward and clicks the pen
curtis opens the door to his truck which is parked in the banks lot
he unbuttons his starched white shirt and places it on the truck seat
he pulls out a dirty blue work shirt and begins buttoning it
dewart sits at the controls of the drilling rig
he sees curtis approaching through the construction site
curtis waves two fingers at him
dewart shuts down the drill
sorry i left you yesterday
dewart hops down and the two approach the drill site
dewart seems sullen
jim came by
i covered for you
i need your help with the depth charts
curtis and dewart sit on the drilling rig eating lunch
fuckin nat put me in charge of frying oysters for that lions club supper
you need another burner
yeah if you still got yours i could use it
you think you could help me with somethin
whatta you need
im gonna build out the tornado shelter in my backyard

dewart eyes him unsure
what do you need
i figure ill do it on saturday borrow some equipment from work

i just need a backhoe a hauler
ill rent the rest
dewart stares off into the distance
he notices curtis looking at him waiting for an answer
you all right man
what do you mean
i just dont wanna see you fuck up
curtis stands and talks with a man in the middle of the tractor trailer depot just off the highway
the man points to a row of shipping containers and uses his hands to mimic how one would be lowered
they shake hands and curtis walks away
the community health center is a one level aged brick building
curtis sits in the lobby filling out a clipboard full of forms and questionnaires
light traffic flows in and out
he flips a page over
the section heading reads family medical history
curtis begins to write
curtis references a slip of paper as he looks for a room number in a long linoleum tiled hallway a book and note pad tucked under his arm
he finds the correct door ajar and knocks
kendra a black woman with short hair sits behind a public issue desk in a public issue office
a poster about flu shots hangs on the wall
there is no personal decor
she half stands and offers a hand
have a seat
curtis shakes and they sit
kendra opens a manila folder
im gonna start by askin you some questions
i already answered all the questions on the forms
yeah i know
i looked at em but i need to get a profile started on you
curtis slides the yellow legal pad out of the book he brought
its the library book on mental illness
out of the five possible symptoms needed to be diagnosed with
reads off the pad delusions hallucinations disorganized speech disorganized behavior and the negative symptoms ive had two
delusions and hallucinations
but they say it has to continue for six months to be diagnosed schizophrenia and mine hasnt been goin on anywhere near that long
so i took this quiz in the back of the book and i scored a five out of a possible twenty
schizophrenia starts at twelve
so they say it might be a
reads off the pad brief psychotic disorder
whatever it is i need to know what to do or what to get on to get this thing under control
kendra stares at him
im a counselor
certified but im not a psychiatrist
i cant prescribe anything to you
i can talk to you i can recommend where to send you but thats it
curtis begins to gather his things
now that said if you want to talk ill listen
for a lot of people thats a good start
now you said here that your mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in her thirties
and youre at
you wanna talk about that
curtis settles in his seat
sets his book on the floor
yeah i dont know my mothers symptoms
i was just
my brother was
i dont know
she just left me in the car in the parking lot at the grocery store one day
and she didnt come back
and then they found her a week later eatin trash out of a dumpster in northern kentucky
my dad had to put her in the state hospital in columbus
and shes been in assisted living ever since
my dad raised me
he died last april
kendra nods a pleasant look on her face
so tell me bout these dreams
curtis studies her face bites at the inside of his cheek
the class has finished
parents and kids trickle out
samantha stands off to the side speaking with the teacher
i dont know what our schedule will be but
thats all right
but i really do think you should continue with the sign language
and any additional therapies that kids need for the cochlear implant
as samantha talks to the teacher curtis looks over flashcards with hannah
he signs sunshine a circle in the sky with the hand then coming down fingers spread
curtis drives while samantha and hannah sleep in the back
surrounding farmland drops quickly into darkness joining a purple sky in the distance
through the passenger window a streak of lightning breaks across the horizon
curtis seeing this repositions to get a better look through the window
its horizontal lightning that appears to leap from cloud to cloud
well defined bolts that strobe the night sky silhouetting towering thunderheads
curtis looks back to samantha and hannah still asleep
he pulls the car over to the shoulder of the interstate and continues watching
he climbs out
cars rush by as curtis gently closes the car door
keeping his eyes on the lightning storm he walks to the shoulder
its a fantastic display of light
hurried and intense
a bolt of lightning reaches down to the ground
sparks pop off the earth in the distance
another bolt streaks down getting closer
curtis sees the traffic continuing to pass by at full speed
is anyone seeing this
curtis walks to the back window of the car and sees samantha sleeping inside
he reaches out to knock but stops himself
he turns back to the lightning and watches
the giant rolling door curls up in the delta agri pro warehouse
sunlight bounces off the finished concrete
curtis pulls the chain for the door as dewart slams the tow latch down on the back of a dump truck
the dump truck and tow trailer sit parked on the street in front of curtis house
dewart stands at the back of the trailer with his hand on the ramp lever as curtis reverses a backhoe onto the street
samantha works her booth at the flea market
hannah neatly organizes a collection of colored beads on the floor
a foot rectangle has been outlined in bright orange paint next to the storm shelter in curtis backyard
other colored markings denote gas and water lines
the bucket on the backhoe digs into the center of the dotted rectangle
dewart maneuvers the backhoes bucket and drops a load of earth into the bed of the dump truck
red the dog barks at the loud machinery from his pen
curtis uses a smaller trench digging machine on the backside of the yard radiating out from the main dig site
he notices a neighbor watching him from they yard next door
samantha tallies cash from the tackle box she uses as a register
hannah counts out the change
dewart assembles a series of pvc pipe next to the trenches curtis dug
curtis work goggles on stands in a head deep hole holding a pneumatic jack hammer up to the exposed exterior wall of the storm shelter
he begins hammering
samanthas car pulls up and parks on the opposite side of the street from their house
she gets out puzzled by the backhoe and trailer parked in front of her house
huge light brown tracks of dirt stripe the concrete driveway
leading hannah by the hand samantha follows the tracks to the backyard
samantha stops mouth agape stunned by what she sees
a foot by foot wide hole that is feet deep sits in the middle of her yard
smaller trenches lead out from it
dewart leans against the propane tank in the back corner of the yard
he digs dirt from underneath his fingernails with a pocket knife
seeing samantha he waves a hand
curtis head appears from the hole
he stops when he sees samantha
they stare at one another
he can see her surprise
he continues up the ladder and walks over to her
dewart watches from the back of the yard
its all right
samantha takes hannah into the house without saying a word
are you out of your mind
she continues into the house
curtis turns frustrated
dewart takes this in then goes back to his nails
hannah watches television in the den by herself
samantha sits on the edge of the bed
curtis stands a few paces back
his hands dug into the back of his dusty jeans
not a word
you didnt say one word about this to me
dont you think you owe me that
dont you think that you might respect me enough to at least consider what i had to say
i didnt want you worryin about it
well im worried curtis
how are you paying for all that
i got a home improvement loan from the bank
samantha is stunned
she stands and gets in his face
how could you do that without talking to me
you know the expenses we have comin up
you want to waste money on a stupid tornado shelter
im doin it
im doin it for us
i know you dont understand
i dont understand
i dont understand half the stuff youve been doin lately
i dont understand you puttin red out back
i dont understand you stayin up all night in that stupid tornado shelter
you dont come to bed half the time
you leave and dont tell me where youre goin
explain that to me
tell me something that helps me understand why youre bein like this
curtis cant look at her
he tries to find words but fails
theres nothin to explain
samantha stares at his face searching for an answer
shes on the verge of tears
im gonna go put hannah to bed
curtis walks out of the room
samantha cant hold back tears run down her face
curtis stares at himself in the mirror
he opens the bottle of prescription pills and shakes out two
looks at them
shakes out another three
he pops the pills in his mouth and drinks from the faucet
its dark and quiet in the house
samantha sleeps on her side her back to curtis
her head is jostled
the bed begins to vibrate
her eyes open
she turns over to see curtis
hes having a seizure
samantha reaches for him
eyes closed his body convulses violently
samantha quickly turns on a bedside lamp
she touches his arms
a small amount of blood begins to trickle from both sides of his mouth
oh my god
oh my god
samantha jumps off the bed and grabs a cordless phone on the dresser
she dials watching her husband continue to shake
i need an ambulance
my husbands having a seizure
samantha goes over to him
holding her hands out cautious to touch him
into the phone okay
samantha puts the phone receiver down on the nightstand
the operators voice still coming through
she touches his arm
suddenly the seizures stop
curtis body is still
his eyes open and he thrashes up in bed
samantha jumps tripping and stumbling backward
curtis sucks short breaths into his lungs
his head darts back and forth eyes wild
he sees samantha staring up at him from the floor
he begins to calm down
curtis touches his mouth
sees the blood there
samantha stands up and goes over to him
she sits on the edge of the bed and touches his arm
are you okay
curtis slowly nods
you were having a seizure
i called an ambulance
curtis sees the phone on the nightstand and grabs it
into the phone no
dont send an ambulance
curtis clicks off the phone
what are you doing
curtis wraps his arms around her
he holds her tight
the sound of ambulance sirens approach from the distance
samantha speaks her voice trembling
baby whats goin on
the ambulance lights splash across the house
curtis escorts two emts down the front walk
he favors his left leg walking with a slight limp
im sorry you fellows had to come all the way out
its what we do
now we can still take you in if you want a doctor to look at those cuts in your mouth
thats all right
ill see somebody on monday
curtis shakes their hands
he turns to walk back in the house and notices neighbors watching from their porches
curtis turns up a bottle of peroxide and swishes it in his mouth
he spits into the kitchen sink
samantha sits at the table watching him
she holds a balled up tissue in her hand
curtis takes a seat across the table
she waits for him to say something
i havent been honest with you
whats goin on
ive been havin these dreams
i guess theyre more like nightmares
its why ive been actin like this
samantha listens with a furrowed brow
they always start with a kind of storm
like a real powerful storm
and theres always this dark thick rain
like fresh motor oil
and then the things people it just makes em crazy
they attack me
sometimes they go after hannah
first one i had red nearly chewed through my arm
thats why you put him out back
what was the dream
it was dewart
we were at the job site
the storm started and somethin happened
his eyes were different
he came after me with a pick ax
and we fought
and he ran it through my leg
curtis zones out for a moment
samantha says nothing
its hard to explain because its not just a dream
its a feeling
im afraid something might be comin
i can not describe it
i just need you to believe me
samanthas eyes are red
she nods slightly and dabs the tissue at the corner of her eye
ive been to a counselor
ive seen her a few times
this makes samantha look up
you know what i come from
and i promised myself
i promised myself i would never leave
and i am doin everything that i can to make that true
the room is quiet
samantha watches her husband
hannah lies flat as the sled moves her through the oval ct scanner
a red lighted crosshair passes over her face
samantha has hannah on her lap
she and curtis listen intently to an attendant who sits next to them with a file
since the doctors approved her for surgery we just need to get her scheduled
the next possible opening is
reviews a calendar the st of next month
thats six weeks
is that okay
curtis stands with russell over the hood of a pick up truck
they look over a roll of ground water charts
russell talks and points to the map but curtis attention is focused elsewhere
he watches dewart in the distance
this point just to the west
i dont think well have any problem
we should be able to get twenty maybe thirty in this next week
but were looking to see how thats gonna shape up so
dewart smiles and makes broad gestures with his arms
hes telling a story to dave who laughs hard
his attention snaps back
what do you think
that sounds good
well get it done
russell rolls up the charts
they walk toward the work site toward dewart
jim fills out paperwork at his desk
there is a knock
curtis walks inside
he stands in front of the desk

jim sets his pen down and leans back

youre gonna have to learn that
i appreciate that but
well it would just be very helpful in this case
well i can put him with russell
anybody else you prefer
whoever you thinks right
curtis turns to leave the office
you been missin a lotta work curtis
my daughters had a lot of doctors visits
i havent let anything get behind
curtis shows himself out
the sun has just set and a purple hue hangs over everything
curtis stands in the very back of the yard and watches a man guide a long flatbed trailer up the driveway
an foot metal shipping container rides on the back
nat and samantha sit at the kitchen table going over a list of food in a note pad
i know they just usually do oysters and fries but what if we did something healthier on the side
what like slaw
nat gets up to refill her drink
she looks out the back door and surveys the construction zone
a forklift lowers the shipping container into the giant hole in the backyard
nat shakes her head
i dont know
maybe a vegetable or salad
dewarts been tellin me how strange curtis has been actin lately
i am so sorry
nat brings her drink back to the table and sits
samantha doesnt look up from her pad
its not like you dont have enough on your plate with hannah
nat puts her hand on samanthas
samantha moves it
things are fine
nat smiles sympathetically
curtis meanders inside
he sees police tactical and survival gear behind the counter
chief among them is a collection of gas masks hanging on the rear partition
can i help you
can i look at one of these gas masks
which one you want to look at
the newest one
the owner of the store removes a mask and hands it to him
curtis fiddles with the mask
one seventy eight
curtis frowns at the price
thats the cheapest one i got in the store
they go all the way up to two ninety
i dont know what you want to spend but a gas mask aint something you want to go cheap on
you got any kids sizes
kids cant wear those
they got a have a special thing its like a hood
i dont fool with those
the perusing shopper listens in
ring me up a couple of em
curtis stands at the drivers door of his pick up
the box sits on the seat in front of him
he opens it and removes one of the gas masks
he stares into its vacant plastic eyes
he drops the mask back into the box and shakes his head
sighs frustrated with it all
he checks over his shoulder scans the parking lot
curtis stands on top of the shipping container that rests in the hole roughly a foot below the yard
wearing tinted goggles he cuts a circular hole in the top of the container with a small blowtorch
the sparks stop and curtis raises the goggles to inspect his work
he kicks at the weld with the heel of his boot and the metal falls into the container
he sets down the torch and removes a roof turbine vent from a cardboard box and holds it up next to the newly cut hole
what the hell are you doin
curtis smiles to himself
he turns to find kyle standing at the edge of the hole
his hands are tucked into the back of his jeans and hes sizing up the work
curtis steps off the roof of the shipping container onto ground level
he holds out a hand and kyle shakes it never taking his eyes off the unfinished shelter
what you got goin on here
just addin on to the storm shelter
kyle notices the pvc piping running in the trenches
you runnin water to it
from our well
runnin sewer out to the city line
how much you spendin on this thing
its not bad
doesnt look it
kyle sees his reluctance
you take your eye off the ball one minute in this economy and youre screwed
you got the cash for this
dont put nothin on credit cards
that shitll eat you up
kyle is staring him down
curtis just looks at the shelter
theres a long silence shared between them
samantha called me
curtis climbs back onto the shipping container and continues installing the roof vent
called you to come tell me to quit
she called cause shes worried
says youve been stressed out
curtis doesnt answer
you stressed out
no more than anybody else

you wanna come by and have dinner sometime kyle
well have a beer and talk about the old days but you got somethin to say just say it

curtis keeps his head down scolded
im just coming here to check on you
well i appreciate it kyle

ill get around to it
theres an awkward moment as curtis works with his back to kyle
you need a hand
curtis turns and looks up at him
shakes his head
ive got it
call me if you need me okay
kyle looks at him for a moment
he turns and walks toward the driveway
kyle turns back
curtis climbs onto the yard and walks over to him
actually you could do me a favor
you still looking for a dog
kyle looks at him
curtis slaps down the tailgate to kyles truck which is parked in the driveway
red tail wagging hops up into the bed
curtis closes the tailgate and sets a leash and two bowls into the back of the truck
curtis rubs red behind the ears
they got a good spot for you okay bud
kyle stands at the passenger door to the truck
i know itll make my girls happy
kyle walks around the truck to the drivers side
curtis walks up and hugs him
kyle slaps him on the back
take care of yourself
i will little brother
you take care of your family
handle your business
kyle smiles shaking his head
kyle climbs into the truck and cranks it
curtis steps back as he pulls away
red looks back from the bed of the truck
hannah fresh from the tub stands to let curtis rub her wet head with a towel
he finishes and stands
hannah looks up at him
curtis signs his hand like a pillow then touches his watch
they move out of the bathroom
curtis sits on the edge of his bed staring at the window in their room
hes already dressed for work
he watches as the thick dark rain hits the window and streaks
he has a curious look on his face
moving down the hall
moving past the den
moving into the kitchen
curtis stops at the entry to the kitchen
samantha wearing a robe stands with her back to him
shes cooking something at the stove
curtis notices the back door standing open
hard rain slants down outside
he looks down at the tile floor
wet footprints track inside
they lead to where samantha is standing
she turns to him
shes pale with a vacant look on her face
her hair is soaking wet
curtis looks at her concerned
she stares back emotionless
she slowly looks down at the counter next to her
a kitchen knife rests there
curtis looks at the knife
they look at one another again
curtis sits at the breakfast table across from hannah
he looks over at samantha
she cooks her back to him
hannah climbs out of her chair and goes to look out the back door
samantha turns and dishes eggs onto curtis plate
she touches his hand
their eyes meet
he wants to take it back and she can see that
it begins to sink in for her
hannah vocalizes something behind them
samantha looks at her husband shakes her head in disbelief
hannah makes another sound pounds on the back door
samantha turns and sees a man standing in their backyard
curtis stands to see out the back door
jim curtis boss stands with his hands on his hips looking down at the planted shipping container
dewart told me you took equipment from work for a project at your house
said thats why you wanted him off your crew
i came out here to see it myself
it was just a hauler and a backhoe
it was saturday
i had em back in less than hours
you know that doesnt matter
i cant even tell you how many rules you broke
what if you had an accident
what if you ran somebody over on your way out here
lawsuit like that could bankrupt me
well im sorry jim

thank god nothin like that happened
ill do whatever i can to make it right
you can pick up your last check on friday
youve got two weeks benefits

jim turns and walks out of the backyard
samantha clears the table
hannah sits watching her father walk in
curtis stops just inside the door closes it
ive been fired
samantha continues clearing the dishes to the sink
she doesnt look up
what about the health insurance
we get two more weeks
samantha slams the plates into the sink
she holds her head back and stares at the ceiling
she walks over to curtis
and slaps him across the face
hannah begins to cry
samantha turns and collects hannah from the table
she grabs her things and walks out of the house
curtis stands alone in the kitchen
curtis walks down the hallway to kendras office
the door ajar he knocks and enters
curtis finds andy a man in khakis and a button up sitting behind the desk
oh scuse me
andy rises from his chair
are you curtis
kendra transferred out
ill be meeting with you today
curtis looks at the man
hes kind of mincing
please sit down
curtis takes a seat
what happened to kendra
she got into a program at osu so shell be transferring near there
ive split her case load with another counselor
its been kind of crazy around here lately
so ive looked over your file
it says your mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in her early thirties
lets start there
curtis looks at the man for a moment then stands and walks out of the room
curtis truck is parked in the driveway with the hood up and the engine running
curtis stands over the vibrating engine studying it
he looks at the belts
he watches them move
curtis hefts a porcelain toilet down the steps of the shelter
a dull light glows through the new entryway thats been knocked out through the back left wall
curtis goes through it
curtis sets the toilet on the floor
he picks up the camping lantern and holds it up to the space
the lack of light makes it feel more cavernous than it is
two cots have been brought down as well as an assortment of supplies
canned food a small gas burner
curtis hangs the lantern onto a hook on the wall and goes about connecting the toilet to a pipe sticking out of the back corner
samantha walks inside followed by hannah and a woman from the flea market
im so sorry
i completely forgot
dont worry about it
i hope you like them
samantha hands over the plastic bag
i brought cash
samantha takes three twenties from her
call me if they dont work and im sorry again
oh its okay
samantha closes the door
samantha takes the tin decorated with ocean creatures down from the fridge
she removes the envelope with the word beach written on it and takes out a stack of bills
she folds the bills over and stuffs them into her purse before placing the empty envelope back in the tin
she looks out back and sees curtis sitting with hannah
the shipping container has been covered over with dirt
two rotating vents spin at either end of the brown mound
curtis sits on the freshly packed dirt signing with hannah
he signs something that makes her laugh
hannah smacks a muddy clump between her hands
curtis touches her nose leaving a dirt smudge
she touches his face smudging it
samantha watches through the back door
samantha tucks hannah into bed
she kisses her on the head and turns out the bedside lamp
samantha leaves the room
samantha steps out of the house
she walks over to curtis who is standing on a grassy section of the yard over an assortment of auto parts
they dont speak for a moment
thats the alternator from the truck
i was just trying to figure out a way to charge enough batteries to run lights down there
ah what the hell
maybe ill hook it up to your old exercycle
samantha almost smiles
curtis keeps his eyes on the parts
you gonna leave me
samantha looks at his hands
they hang by his sides
you flinched when i touched your hand this morning
i was in one of your dreams
can you deal with that
he holds open his hand to her
she takes it
then i made a decision
we cancel the beach trip
we have enough to cover bills for the next two months with your last check
im going to get a job
youre gonna find another job
im going to call to see if we can move hannahs surgery up
well need to see what it costs to extend your policy to the end of the year
i want you to see a psychiatrist
not a counselor from the free clinic
doctor shannan gave me the number of somebody
but uh i just dont think we can afford it
well find the money
also the lions club suppers this weekend
i want you to come with me
i dont want to see any of those people
i want you to go
i need to do something normal
samantha lets go of his hand and walks back to the house
curtis goes back to studying the auto parts
the inside of the club is a musty banquet hall with wood panelled walls and a drop tile ceiling
the place is packed
rows of folding tables fill the center of the room
a long line has formed along the side wall that wraps to a serving station at the back
heated metal bins filled with fried oysters and french fries
curtis gets in line with his family
curtis holds two paper plates
how many pieces does hannah get
curtis uses tongs to grab pieces of fried oyster
looking up he can see back through the kitchen to an open door outside
dewart stands there over a butane fired frying pot
he wears an apron and stares at curtis
curtis moves down the line
lewis sits with cammie and their baby
he laughs and talks with another man
from a different table russell leans over to eye curtis
curtis sits at a table with his family
he loads hannahs plate up with ketchup
a tap on his shoulder
curtis turns to find dewart standing over him
whatre you doin here
not here man
dewart taps him on the shoulder again
i said what are you doin here
curtis stands and dewart takes a step back
the general noise of the place starts to quiet down as people take notice
a few stand
i told people what you been doin
you cut me loose
everything we been through
dewart shoves him in the chest
you aint fucking sorry
you sorry you wouldnt cut me loose
we fuckin friends
this how you treat friends
curtis places a hand on dewarts chest
dewart punches curtis in the face
samantha gathers hannah and moves back
dewart shoves curtis across the table
oysters and bottles go everywhere
the entire room is on its feet watching
curtis slips getting up
dewart walks around the table heading for him
curtis stands and kicks dewart in the knee
it buckles back and hes on the floor
he cries out and grabs the twisted joint
curtis paces over him covered in ketchup and soda
he shouts down at him
he wipes at his face
sees all of the people staring at him
you think im crazy
is that what he told you
curtis turns over a table
he points to the gawking crowd
well listen up
there is a storm comin like nothing you have ever seen
and not a one of you is prepared for it
you think im crazy
im talkin lewis
you think im a thief
the sound muted
she looks on as curtis paces pointing and yelling red faced at the crowd
curtis backs off
sleep well in your beds
cause if this thing comes true there aint gonna be any more
curtis looks down at dewart
he turns to see hannah
shes tucked under her mothers leg crying
this hits him hard
looking at samantha his eyes fill with tears
samantha leading hannah by the hand walks to curtis
he stares at her on the verge of breaking down
she takes her hand and gently pulls his head down to her shoulder
without another look toward the crowd samantha leads her family out of the dining hall
hannah stands on a toolbox and rests her elbows on the side of curtis truck
the hood is open
she watches her father fiddle with re installing the alternator
his fingers covered in grease
hannah steps down from the toolbox and walks into the front yard
curtis pauses hearing a high pitched warbling sound in the distance
he notices hannah is gone
he pulls his head out from the hood and sees hannah standing on the curb
she looks down the street
he runs down his driveway wiping his hands on a rag and watching the horizon
a flock of birds flying in intricate geometric patterns swarm above the house at the end of the street
they twist and bend into speckled black shapes
hannah watching walks into the street
curtis catches her by the hand
he turns away from the birds to see a storm cell building on the opposite horizon
he scoops hannah into his arms stepping back from it
the sound of the birds grows louder
curtis pivots to find the mass of birds barreling down the street toward him
he turns away as the wall of birds crash past him
the force so powerful it knocks him backward
he covers hannahs head dodging the onslaught of wind and wings
the flock passes
curtis stands his face cut and scraped
hannah cries clinging to his chest
the windshield of a car parked next to him shatters
curtis looks at the broken glass
a dead bird its neck broken rests crumpled on the hood
another bird crashes into the asphalt just in front of him
curtis looks up
the flock of birds are circling overhead and diving down at him
more birds crashing to the ground
curtis covers his head
the neighborhoods tornado sirens begin to sound
curtis rushes hannah toward his front door as dozens of birds plummet from the sky
the sirens blaring
curtis wakes to samantha shaking him by the shoulders
shes nearly on top of him in the bed
tornado sirens continue to scream throughout the neighborhood
curtis looks to the window
rain and hail are battering the house
he jumps to his feet and grabs samantha by the arm
they rush out of the room
curtis bursts into the room
hannah is standing at the window looking out
curtis scoops her up scaring her
she begins to cry as they run from the room
wind blows fiercely as pellets of hail bounce off the ground
rain cuts at a sharp angle
the tornado sirens continue
curtis hannah in his arms and samantha close behind exits the back of the house and heads to the storm shelter
he passes hannah to samantha and fumbles with the padlock keys
at the doors to the shelter samantha holds her robe up to shield hannah from the hail
curtis gets the lock and opens the door
they go inside
curtis slams the doors behind them
its pitch black until he gets to the switch on the lantern
the room fills with the orange glow as curtis snaps the padlock through the door handles
curtis leads them through the entry to the larger section of the shelter
samantha takes hannah and sits with her on one of the cots
shes signing to her trying to calm her down
curtis goes to a trunk in the corner and begins rooting through it
he removes two gas masks and an oxygen mask connected to a small tank
he goes over and kneels in front of hannah
he tries slipping the oxygen mask over her face
samantha grabs his wrist
dont do that
put this on
curtis hands samantha a gas mask
are you kidding
please just do it
he looks to hannah and places an oxygen mask over her face
there we go
keep it out of your eyes
he signs to her
i love you
curtis eases on the knob at the top of the tank
he climbs onto the cot and puts his arm around them
he slips on his gas mask
samantha is hesitant
she looks at her husband in the mask and leans back against the side of the container
hannah looks up at her
she touches her mothers mask
samantha slips on the gas mask
the camping lantern on the floor casts long shadows up
the faint boom of thunder rolls softly outside
the family sits huddled together on the cot wearing their masks
a crack of thunder rattles the shelter
curtis snaps awake still wearing his gas mask
samantha has climbed on the other cot and is asleep
hannah sleeps under curtis arm
he gently lays her down on the cot and stands to stretch
he walks into the original section of the shelter and grabs a small flashlight off the metal shelving
he clicks it on and moves over to the concrete steps
he takes a seat and listens
he places his hand onto the metal door
a boom of thunder
he can hear the rain and wind blowing outside
samantha rubs curtis shoulder gently waking him
wake up babe
curtis head moves
he sees that samantha and hannah have removed their masks
wheres your mask
we took them off
take it off
take it off
curtis slips the mask off his face
worried he takes a breath
you need to open the door now
curtis doesnt move
he looks at them
what if its
what if its not over
what if its not over
get the keys
open the door
curtis slowly gets to his feet
he sees the dark entryway to the original section of the shelter
taking the lantern he walks to it
samantha and hannah follow
curtis stops just inside
he holds the lantern up illuminating the padlocked metal doors
he looks back at his family then climbs the steps
he places his hand on the door
its still storming
i can hear it
samantha stares at him
the room is silent
i dont hear anything
put your hand on the door
you can feel it
he takes samanthas wrist and guides her to the doors
he watches her face as she places a hand against the metal
she looks at him her eyes getting red and shakes her head no
curtis kneels in front of hannah and mimics the signs from earlier
signing and speaking thunder
do you feel it
he flinches again
looks to the ceiling signing and speaking you feel it
you feel it
hannah walks to her mother
samantha holds onto her
curtis steps back from them
they watch him their backs to the doors
he flinches and covers his mouth
baby theres no storm outside
samantha walks over to him
i wouldnt lie to you
we love you very much
please open the door
curtis is on the verge of tears
he slowly reaches into his jeans pocket
he removes the keys
he holds them out to samantha
samantha looks at the keys then at curtis
tears shake from his trembling face
i love you but if i open the door then nothins gonna change
youll see that everythings fine but nothing will change
this is what it means to stay with us
this is something you have to do
he looks at hannah then samantha
curtis steadies himself trying to control his flinching
he wipes his face with the back of his hands and takes a deep breath
curtis walks toward the doors
on the steps he reaches up to the padlock
the keys shake in his fingers
he turns to samantha
could you move hannah back
samantha picks hannah up in her arms and curtis watches them retreat to the rear wall
he goes back to the lock
he inserts the key
the padlock pops open
curtis removes it
he looks back at samantha then flings open the doors
curtis holds his hand up to cover his eyes
he stares up at a crystal blue sky
samantha watches as curtis steps out of the shelter
curtis rises through the storm shelters entryway
out of the corner of his eye he catches curtis is startled
he turns to see a crew of men from the power company hoisting a ladder onto the pole at the corner of the house
a power line dangles overhead
he turns to see neighbors in their yards clearing debris
leaves and branches clutter the ground
the aftermath of a storm
samantha steps out of the shelter holding hannah
she surveys the damage
she walks over to curtis and hugs him
he kisses samantha on the head
curtis looks up at the sky
curtis sits with samantha in the plush office of a psychiatrist
curtis rubs his hand over the soft leather upholstery on the couch
do you have any vacation time that you could use
i dont have a job right now
well i know that times are hard but i think its really important for you to separate yourself from that storm shelter
i think you need to break away from it for awhile
we can start you on some medication that i think will help but that action alone would mean a lot
we usually go on a trip to myrtle beach every summer
we were gonns go this month
i think that would be okay if we start the medication now
it would give you all some time to prepare as a family but i want to be clear when curtis gets back hell need to take more time than that
what does that mean
i mean that hell need hands on therapy at a real facility
curtis looks up for the first time
you mean i have to leave my family
i think you need to seriously commit to some treatment
curtis processes this
samantha takes his hand
curtis scoops handfuls of sand out of a foot deep hole on the beach
he slops the wet mixture into a castle shaped bucket his back to the shoreline of gentle breaking waves
signing and speaking hey
hannah sits on her knees in front of curtis sprinkling dry sand over castle shaped mounds already formed
samantha drops four hotdogs into a boiling pot of water and stirs a bubbling pot of canned chili
the beach condo is small but brightly furnished
the wooden deck hangs off the back of the beach condo
a picnic table is set with plastic place mats and forks
wind lifts the corner of a stack of napkins
the wind blows harder fanning the napkins off the table
curtis still working in the sand puts a top on the sand castle
we put a top on it
curtis smooths out the sand in the castle shaped bucket and turns it over to top off their sand mound
he hands the bucket over for hannah to refill
the sound of the waves behind them has stopped
they dont notice
curtis takes two fingers and digs a small trench around the sand castle
curtis looks up ready to sign the letters but sees hannah staring at the water
she looks at him and signs something with her hands
what is it honey
curtis misses it
he shakes his head no and hannah signs again slowly s t o r m
curtis turns to the shoreline getting to his feet
he looks down at hannah who watches mesmerized
scared she looks to her father
he grabs her under the arms and rests her on his hip
she buries her head into his chest
a gust of wind greets samantha as she walks out onto the deck holding a plate of hotdogs and a bowl of chili
she stops seeing the horizon
her mouth falls open
she slowly sets the plate and bowl down on the table her mind racing
she looks down at curtis in disbelief
curtis looks up to the condo and makes eye contact
he studies her face
samantha looks at her husband trying to process it all
she looks out at the horizon then back down to curtis
concern on her face she nods to him
curtis sees her nod
samanthas eyes still locked on curtis soften as if to apologize
after a moment she mouths to him i love you
curtis nods back to her
she looks back up to the shoreline
curtis feet kick up sand as he rushes back toward the condo
samantha hasnt moved from the porch
a light rain begins to fall
her hands grip the railing
she turns her left palm up
dark rain collects there
behind samantha curtis appears in the open sliding door clutching hannah
the storm cell is reflected in the glass next to him
samantha looks down at her palm
she rubs the thick viscous rain in her fingers
she looks back up at the storm
on samanthas face okay
