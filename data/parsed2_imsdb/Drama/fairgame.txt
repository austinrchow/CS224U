written by jez butterworth john henry butterworth based on the memoir fair game my life as a spy my betrayal by the white house by valerie plame extreme close angles
on a figure kneels in a cell in tight stress position
convulsed with intense pain
we move closer its a woman
everything you face in life
everything you come up against
she is hauled to her feet by unseen hands
shes carried head first fast down a corridor by four men like a battering ram
everything that stands in your way
into another cell
a fifth masked man
on the table a car battery
screams ring out down the empty corridor
blows rain down on her
the blindfold is torn off
your foes your fears your terrors
your darkest nights
she is thrust into a bath and held under water
close on her face as the bubbles of her desperate breath subside her eyes glaze and a single smoke swirl of crimson blood rises up from her parted lips
are all sent to ask you the same question
the only question
suddenly she looks directly at us
who are you
eighty storey star scrapers reflect half built death stars
shimmering buildings and cranes for miles
acres of climate controlled exhibition space swarming with global civil engineers
tented meeting rooms stands
the bone dry wheels of global commerce turning
a striking blonde s crosses a concourse towards a malaysian woman in chanel
valerie plame extends a hand
i hope im not late
valerie and the malaysians rise swiftly above the hordes
when do you leave kuala lumpur ms
i fly to taiwan tuesday then back to dusseldorf
i really only need five minutes of his time
i hope we are lucky
he is very busy man
valerie sits at an enormous marble conference table before a wrap around view of the petronas towers
opposite her two neat maylasian secretaries with pads in front of them
she smiles back
mr tabir very busy this morning
oh i can imagine
seeings were waiting
at the head of the table a puffy year old sri lankan hafiz is shelling peanuts on the marble regarding her
why dont you practice your little pitch on me
his tones contains an edge of menace
she smiles politely
if its all the same i know all my uncles business
he trusts me
im sure youre aware mr
no answer youre aware that recently your subsidiary kopa oleochemicals developed an organic ester based lubricant derived from kernel oil that makes offshore drilling significantly more environmental
my company cognis cmbh wants interrupting flatly you american
you a maple leafs fan
you must be the only person from torontos not a hockey fan
valerie holds his dead eyes
oh im a fan
dads from vancouver so im a canuck
between us the maple leaves suck
they should never have signed mark bell
guys a liability on an off the ice
so whos your team
i dont like hockey
he holds her eye impassively
chanel suit enters
unfortunately mr tabir has no window this morning
but tonight he extends invitation to private reception at his residence
is that ok
i really dont wish to intrude
she meets hafizs level gaze
he doesnt blink
come to the party
mercedes pull up outside a mansion above the sprawling city
not a party
asian men with name badges swap cards
valerie makes small talk with some germans
she spots her quarry at the end of the corridor
she excuses herself
jessica mcdowall cognis gmbh
thank you for allowing me to come to your beautiful home
how can i help you
mr tabir i wonder if you had time to glance at our proposal which would allow kopa to access to cognis current petrochemical service partners
essentially its a man comes up and whispers to mr
he stops her
please excuse me i have to attend to something
my assistant here will make you comfortable
lit by a stock market ticker valerie sits in front of a large desk
glances at papers on the desk
the door opens
its not tabir
i was waiting for mr
my uncle had to leave
he asked me to drive you to his tennis club
you can have your meeting there
as they pull away valerie looks back
she spots tabir through a window still at the party she freezes
hafiz turns off onto a deserted road in the lake gardens
why are we stopping
he looks at her
undoes his seatbelt
macdowall my uncle believes that trust is something you earn
and he doesnt trust anyone until he knows them very very well
he strokes her hair
she holds his eye
but he trusts you hafiz
the temperature in the car drops a hundred degrees
how do you know my name
hafizs brain does in
he flips open the glove box
your car was swept an hour ago
he goes for the door
do not get out
if you get out of this car i cant protect you
hafiz stops dead
looks in the rearview a black car yards behind
he grabs her arm
who are you
let go of my arm hafiz
who the fuck are you
he releases her arm
she holds his gaze
your uncle is in business with abu domar khan shaking his head his company provides khan smiling with shipping money thats bullshit
laundering and contraband components
khan has made contact with a terror organisation via an aid agency in pakistan
they are seeking materials to build a weapon
she fixes him your brother is in kalutara jail in colombo facing execution for trafficking
we can help him
you cant help him
we can help him
listen to me
you have to think straight here hafiz
because i promise you one thing
right now you have no idea what we can and cannot do
hafiz looks in the rear view
at the floor
deep inside something stirred
she saw it
we need information about your uncle
if you help us we help you
if you dont your brother dies and tomorrow youre sitting next to your uncle in a cell in thailand and it wont be me asking the questions
hafiz closes his eyes head back
she watches him closely
you will get a call at am
youll be asked if you need a cleaner
you want her to come three mornings per week
do you understand
i said do packed
behind the bar fox news bombing of afghanistan
at the bar a birthday celebration
in back around a table piled high with empty mexican plates a group of girls catch up
valerie and some friends
so after like six hours he finally manages to stand up on the snowboard and the instructor lets go of him and he just plummets
laughter i swear to god he cant turn slow down for like four hundred yards
and yet im incredible in bed
at the bar joe wilson handsome s watches the explosions on the screen
he picks up a tray
keep the change
valerie is being quizzed by her buddys boyfriend steve
so what do you do valerie
i work in venture capital
brewster jennings here in georgetown
so like net startups
retail and consumer
basically we create pooled investment vehicles
sounds high risk
but you know
high risk high return
pretty boring actually
so what do you do
joe arrives back to the table with a tray of drinks
theyre out of corona
i got me and steve wont fly on the a rolling rock
we wont even get the same train together
we got the same train to your moms
it only takes one to fly a disneyland
a sarin attack on plane into a nuclear power disneyland
station whatever theyre telling us were totally vulnerable
i mean whos protecting us
its real scary
would you risk taking your kids to disneyland right now
far from being a playground of the imagination disneyland is actually a giant clearing house for crappy merchandise
and space mountain is a major disappointment
valerie tries not to laugh
gives him a stern look
joe thinks disneyland is vegas for kids
a dirty bomb in vegas
you get on a plane theres two guys with turbans seats a and
joe closes his eyes
valerie kicks him under the table
they look nervous
theyre sweating saying prayers
to himself ye gods
steve you have a two year old
youre off that plane
youre calling the cops
i think if were honest we all are
to joe joe
on a plane
whats the call
joe opens his eyes
he takes off his glasses
and looks at jeff
valerie is driving home
joe in the passenger seat
every time we go out
he started it hes drunk joe
everybodys had a hard day
theyre just trying to let off steam
by invoking quasi racist connundra
the guys a parent
is he telling his four year its dianas birthday
jeffs old to fear all men in her best friend
so you cant call him a racist pussy
if not sitting there while someone spouts obnoxious crap makes you an asshole
then im an asshole
and you knew that when you married me
by the way
how was your trip
two hundred people in the main banquet hall
joe walks through the crowd
working the room
valerie accepts an hors doeuvre
catches sight of joe through the crowd
they catch eyes
she leans to her friend
joe excuses himself and turns
valerie stands there
i was staring
its just im sure weve met before
so who am i
he flounders a little
she offers her hand
former ambassador to gabon
ambassador in iraq during the gulf war
has a reputation for trouble
youve been misinformed
i was only acting ambassador in iraq
he does too
so what do you do ms
present day valerie asleep in bed
she suddenly shakes
joe wakes to see his wife lost in a nightmare
im an energy consultant for a firm in brussels
and do you enjoy your work
present day the bedroom she doesnt wake
he strokes her arm
on her wrist a dark bruise
flashback the reception
valerie looks into joes eyes
i love it
joe carries the year old twins samantha and trevor in pyjamas downstairs
wheres the babysitter
into the kitchen
valerie coat on bolting coffee
didnt i say
she cant get here til after lunch
ill work from home this morning
are you sure relax
me n spongebob are on it
the kids start fighting
she picks up her bag
break it up
trevor dont hit were having supper with the your sister
but if you want to skip it they know youre busy i promise to behave
i promise to behave
were all gonna be on our best behavior
she closes the front door
joe looks momentarily marooned
he begins picking up soft toys off the floor
counter proliferation tracks and thwarts nuclear and wmd acquisition by rogue nations and non state actors
an agent walks six analysts through a crowded open plan office
people squeezed in cubbyholes
were the fastest growing division in the agency which sounds cool but means you may have to share a desk
work like hell for years you may get your own cubbyhole
and if youre a workaholic they make you boss and you get he knocks on a door
valerie comes bursting out
we follow valerie into the next office where her colleague ali s indian is on the phone
hafiz hired a cleaner
into phone gotta go
kuala lumpur just went live
ali hangs up and follows her out into the corridor
she scans the page shes holding
what time did he call this in
hundred hours pst
hafiz in a corridor in his uncles offices late at night
light from a photocopier flashes across his sweating face
the asset passed the intel to the cleaner at approximately eight fifteen local time this morning
hafiz hands a folded piece of paper to his elderly cleaning woman
she puts it in her apron pocket
she made the drop fifty minutes later
just outside ko yonh subway station
the cleaner alights leaving her new straits times on the seat
a bald asian commuter next to her along picks it up
the paper is opened to a centre page feature of george bush
there is hafizs photocopy
a field team picked it up and d and dd it at the safe house
in a cheap hotel room under a broken ceiling fan another asian man scans the image into a laptop behind him the bald commuter strikes a match and burns the
valerie in her cramped office with half a dozen field agents briefs from a diagram on a white board
we have a shipment
a holding company in pakistan asks tabir to purchase un identified units trackable by part numbers from
teludyne electronics of lowell massachusetts
two men from the briefing in a whipped chevy watch a red truck leave an industrial unit in the suburbs of lowell
the shipment is delivered to goza tech in secaucus new jersey
the red truck turns into a low grey set of prefab buildings in a business park
the chevy watches a forklift truck lift a single pallet out and deliver it into the warehouse
there its bundled in with a second shipment of legitimate electronic parts and documentation attached that masks its point of origin
valerie ali and the rest of the team walk through the neon lit maze of packing cases and pallets towards a concerned looking superintendent
its then dispatched as medical electronics en route to a company in johannesburg south africa
first it spends the night at a bonded customs warehouse in the port of jersey
thats the intercept
can i help you
valerie shows id to the owner
sir were from u
can i take a moment of your time
he takes off his cap and looks sick
an agent cracks the packing case with a crowbar white cardboard boxes
valerie draws a buck knife and slices it open rumaging in polystyrene chips and comes out with a coke sized white plastic cylinder with two contacts at one end
what the hell is that
valerie looks at the object
a blinding flash of pure white light becomes a giant bulbous cloud of rolling hellfire
it mushrooms twenty thousand feet over the new mexico desert
an awesome sight
a spark gap is a high energy voltage controlled switching device
as a gaggle of schoolkids watch the sixty year old footage of the manhattan project on a plasma screen valerie passes through the compound with dr forster a geeky scientist
in his s
he holds the intercepted component
to detonate a nuclear bomb you need to be able to switch high voltage high current electrical circuits at very high speeds to the nearest hundredth of a nanosecond
they pass through a security door to the labs
the extremely short rise times are achieved by discharging a low induct high voltage capacitor through the spark gap into the bridge wire inside the warhead
the ballpark is kilovolt and mf for the capacitor with a peak current between and amperes
does it have other uses
high speed photography industrial photo chemistry
zapping kidney stones
is someone out there building the fire train for a nuclear device component by component
shakes his head youre talking one helluva complicated process
this guy is just one tiny piece in the jigsaw
she hands him a piece of paper
this is a list of other components exported through the same network over the last years
high speed monitioring devices
reading quartz rate sensors
takes off his glasses
its not kidney stones
thank god you stopped this
im not stopping it
confused i dont understand
valeries team are in a briefing room
we keep the transaction live
trace it all the way to the end user
she takes them through a full whiteboard
the shipment arrives in joburg on the st
its put in an unmarked container and shipped to the free trade zone in dubai
our asset meets there with the buyer on the rd
she tosses a spark gap to one of her team
dr forster and his team at los alamos have altered the impedence timings of the spark gaps by a fraction of a nanosecond
basically they wont know it doesnt work til it doesnt work
can we put a wire on the asset
the door at the back opens
the deputy of cpd enters with the chief
everybody sits up
this network has avoided detection for years
expect meticulous operational security and counter surveillance
the deputy director of cdp buttonholes her
the chief wants to see you
valerie walks with mike and bill their chief
val seventh floor have issued a directive for a joint task force on iraq
we want you to head it up
valerie doesnt blink
you can pick your team
this is top priority
down the line d
what about the dubai op
mike says you got a hunch on the buyer
based out of karachi
on a wire picked up in cairo he talks about componentry from a known source in pakistan hes moving to an unnamed gulf state
vaziris devoutly shia
iraqs controlled by the sunni
theres no way this is iraq
theyre all good muslims right
and martin luther king and the kkk are both christian
from monday i need you both eyes on iraq
at the door they shake hands
mike and valerie walk off
dont fuck up
a framed photograph of joe walking in the rose garden with the forty first president george hw bush
to joe wilson with respect and best wishes george bush
states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil arming to threaten the peace of the world
cnn is on in the background low
state of the union address
joe working on something recording voice notes half watching the president over his papers
they could provide these arms to terrorists giving them the means to match their hatred
across the room beneath a wall of well thumbed tomes two year old twins trevor and samantha are lost in play
trevor hauls in the flex of a globe lamp on a top shelf
they could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the united states
in any of these cases the price of indifference would be catastrophic
joe turns as the shelf gives way and an avalanche of books and keepsakes buries his kids
rushes over hey hey hey
lets take a look at you
no broken bones
he lugs them out
the front door opens
its heather the babysitter
joe im sorry im late
on tv live
the president crossing the white house lawn towards marine one
as the kids play with heather in the lounge joe makes a coffee in the kitchen watching the president on tv as he mounts the ramp
the cabin door shuts tight
a wash of rotor blades
the chopper lifts off
joe takes the coffee and walks out onto the deck
he looks up into the sky
a thrumming builds
the deck shakes the sky turns black as marine one thunders over low
val takes her eye from a magnifying stand
no one around
alone valerie surrounded by piles of files and folders scans pictures of military hardware checks it against its corresponding aerial signature
how do you think she got the job
she cocks an ear
putting on their coats two male analysts memo comes out saying we got two percent women in executive roles
its quotas by another name
theres ten guys i could name could do the job better
i wonder whos shes fucking
suddenly dont you have a home to go to
mike her director is there
in mikes office
she reading the document
dia released the report tuesday
winpac arent buying and state kicked it back but its making waves in the vice presidents office
he looks at her what do you think
hes been there hundreds of times
knows the arena inside out
you dont look overjoyed
hes been working hard to build his business
then theres the twins
moneys kinda tight right now
he looks at her were at full stretch here
you know that better than anyone
hes helped us before
could you ask him to come in
the vast lobby at langley
operatives analysts come and go in the hushed marble atrium
joe in a dark suit attache case stares at the wall
reads the inscription
in honor of those members of the central intelligence agency who gave their lives in the service of their country joe and valerie lie in bed
face to face
you want to go out for breakfast
or stay here
i want to live with you
she looks into his eyes
a tear rolls out of her eye
theres something i have to tell you
present day the memorial on the north wall
just rows and rows of anonymous black stars
dead covert officers
what are you thinking
is your name really valerie
his wife is standing there
he moves away from the memorial
in this unfamiliar context this is slightly awkward
nice place you got here
smiles i need to get you cleared
a big visitors badge on joe
side by side
they go down
you work in the basement
i work in georgetown for brewster jennings
were a small firm of venture capitalists
that must be interesting work
it pays the rent
valerie leads joe into a windowless room
five or six analysts
agents from cia and state department
this is joe wilson
joe this is mike the deputy chief of cpd
they shake ill leave you guys to it
businesslike valerie leaves
mr wilson what can you tell us about yellowcake
joe looks around the room
clears his throat
i believe its a concentrate obtained from uranium ore used to create fissile material for weapons programs
but im not a scientist
what about niger
the un human development index ranks niger the number one least liveable country in the world
i started my foreign service there
as ambassador to gabon i travelled back many times
then as director of africa policy for the nsc under president clinton i frequently visited often met with prime minister mayaki
i know the former foreign minister
i know the minister of mines
the office of the vice president has received a report concerning a memorandum of sale between the governments of niger and iraq for the purchase of five hundred tons of
yellowcake uranium ore
he fixes joe
mike contd i dont have to tell you how serious this allegation is
no sir you dont
he leans forward
this is a request from the vice president
can you help us
a dc judders in low over hills surrounding niamey airport
inside joe two days growth blinks out the window
below a rusty burned out dc which didnt make it
joe in the back of a hot rickety renault rattling along the highway into town
low earthen dwellings
a tiny hot cell
a sign on the bathroom door
red hot shover
turns the ceiling fan on
joe lathers up his face to shave
he turns on the tap
he looks at himself in the mirror
bien revenue a niger m
joe unshaven shakes hands with a year old nigerien
par la grace dallah
comment allez vous m
inside we subtitle the mixture of french dialect and hausa
last time we met i was minister you ambassador
now thanks to allah we are free men
youre growing a beard no
so it would seem
so tell me
how can niger help its old friend america
several analysts sit around a table including the lead analyst paul
two of them are the guys who were bad mouthing valerie
another is joe turner a dough faced offical from winpac weapons intelligence non proliferaton and control
reads in summer iraq sought to purchase high alloy t aluminum tubes manufactured in china
the high spec of these tubes led us to conclude they were intended for the enrichment of uranium
in august j
flew to vienna to meet with iaea scientists
turner produced this report aspects of which represents the cias present position
im happy to take questions
the inr concluded late last year that these tubes were probably for artillery use and the doe agreed they exactly matched those used by iraq for artillery rockets
where are the tubes
winpac has them
weve examined them
this is my point
none of you guys has even seen the tubes
ive seen them
everyone looks at her
and when was that
valerie looks up
slightly surprised by his tone
when i seized them last year in jordan
when i headed the covert team that intercepted them bought back samples and delivered them to you guys at winpac
a couple of the analysts try not to smile
so i take it youre not a nuclear expert
these tubes are an exact match for those developed by german scientist gernot zippe in the s
valerie turns to her notes from her reading
im no nuclear expert
houston wood at virginia u atomic facility is
he also knows dr zippe whos and lives in austria and he told him that the wall thickness of the iraqi tubes was three or four times the thickness of
and the tubes are twice as long as zippes design
in fact the only similarity between his tubes and the alumumium tubes is that theyre made of aluminium
a metal that hasnt been used in gas centrifuges since
the chauvanist analysts share a look of respect for valerie
still turner doesnt give up
i went to vienna
ive worked on this for months
so basically theyre your tubes and if we dont let you win youre going home
no one is saying youre wrong here
but if youre right its huge
so we ask the question
we have to ask the question
joe rides shotgun in a x driven deep into the sahara
niger has two uranium mines in the sahara desert
the others run by cogema a french subsidiary jointly controlled by the japanese and germans
a collossal earthworks defacing the flat hot moonscape
joe is escorted around the mines by a small team
tons of yellowcake is not an off the books size transaction it represents a production increase in the nations annual output of uranium
a sale that size would leave a huge paper trail
joe sits on his bed under the noisy fan making notes
any documentation would by law have to be signed by the prime minister foreign minister and the minister of the mines
but say it was an off the books deal
the long road back from the mines the previous day joes land rover pulls over
everyone comes out to see them
how do you hide the transportation of tons of anything let alone lightly refined uranium
contd youre talking fifty semi tractor trucks on one road through villages where nothing passed for months except maybe one bush taxi
it would be the biggest event for months
to say they forgot its like kids forgetting christmas
inside joe sits at the dining room table debriefed by two cia agents over chinese take out
the droughts of the s and s were met by millions of dollars of u
s aid which continues to this day
it just doesnt make sense niger would compromise this lifeline
for that reason and the others ive given its my opinion that the sale couldnt happen
joe shows them out
shuts the door
what happens next
they write a report
give it to the analysts
itll be re written then kicked upstairs where itll be thrown in with whoever elses report they got joe snorts derisively
you guys are hysterical
i cant believe youre actually gonna send someone else all the way out there to ask exactly the same questions
you cant compile intelligence from a single source
thats not intelligence
thats an opinion
i can save the cia some air fare here
there isnt a snowflakes chance in hell this thing happened
what if youre wrong
one guy says its true
its not true
lots of guys say its true its still not true
but it works
checks and balances
what am i a check or a balance
youre a teeny tiny weeny cog in a giant machine
but you did your job
you should feel good
they count on that
thats why they dont pay you
im not feeling that right now
she puts her arms around his neck
kisses him sexily
i can get the kids to make you a medal if itll help
us double ohs are more about the gratuitous sex
ill see what i can do
they start making out
president in your speeches now you rarely talk or mention osama bin laden
why is that
valerie leans over an analysts desk as together they study photographs of a syrian man in his sixties on the analysts screen
the tv is on in the corner of the computer screen
the idea of focusing on one person indicates people dont understand the scope of the mission
terror is bigger than one person
so i just dont spend that much time on him kelly to be honest with you
valerie looks up and stops
across the floor scooter libby his assistant and two aides walk past
why is the ovp here
the deputy director hears a knock
the vice presidents men are here
what the fuck
a lone analyst sits sweating bullets
libby spectacles on thick folder open on his knee
my name is i
im the chief of staff to the vice president
im an analyst
in non proliferation
what can you tell the vice president about aluminium tubes
valerie and mike queue up in the mess with jim pavitt the deputy director of the cia
the veeps just dotting the is
the only time a vice president comes to langley is to cut a fucking ribbon
cheney doesnt trust us
this shit with dick goes back thirty years
itll blow over
he turns to valerie where are we on iraq
behind the curve sir
most of the intel is outdated
we dont have a single operative or asset in the country
what about geo satellite imaging
with respect sir you cant look at this problem from space and make a call
so talk to the defectors
the defectors are unreliable
most are supplied through a former asset the agencys had on a burn notice since
its a racket
they walk in and get paid to say whatever the pentagon wants to hear
so were blind
we need sources we can rely on
we need to get in close
val thinks she can get us inside the weapons program
pavitt looks at her
rows and rows of stationary
shelves filled pads pens
shelves twenty feet high
valerie selects a pad and a pencil and approaches the counter where a lugubrious woman in a pink sari is doing su doku
valerie pays for her notebook and steps out into the streets throng with traffic
somalian taxi drivers
central africans ferrying exotic produce
egyptians smoking apple tobacco
a different world
valerie head shrouded in a scarf puts the notebook in her bag and pushes her way along the crowded street buzzing with scooters and pedestrians
she steps through an archway into an ancient cloister filled with an excited clamor
fresh faced students pile into a lecture theater
the warping of the extra dimension is analogous to the warping of spacetime in the vicinity of a massive object eg a black hole
valerie sits at the back
she opens her new notebook and listens
on stage an old middle eastern professor is giving a lecture with the help of an over head projector
giant shadow hands deftly trace algebraic formulae onto projector
red shifting generates a large ratio of energy scales so that the natural scale at one end of the extra dimension is much larger
its an honor to meet you at last dr
the prof walks with valerie talking excitedly
i was unable to attend your string gravity seminar at mit but i read a transcript
truly groundbreaking work
the faculty have just moved me so you must excuse the mess
he shows valerie up a stone staircase and through a door
lots still in boxes
my old rooms were on the other side of the courtyard
they were smaller but i got the morning sunlight
will you settle for peppermint tea
the professor hands valerie a cup of mint tea and sits
tell me dr
harper did you read my latest paper on quarks
i cite your essay more than once
i would be very intrigued to know what you made of my findings
she sits forward
sir dr harper is in cambridge massachusetts
she received a call yesterday requesting she stay home for hours
the professor blinks
i dont understand
who are you
im sorry for misleading you
but im here to ask you the same question
he stops because you are not professor aziz
he stands there
im sorry to surprise you like this sir
your name is doctor harif al fallari
you were born in basra
the old man looks perplexed
even a little amused
this is indeed a strange morning
madam there seems to have been a mistake
my name is said uhmah aziz
i am a theoretical physicist
i model space
ive never been to basra
im a teacher
id like to be of assistance
but im afraid i cant help you
so youre not doctor fallari
ive never even heard of this man
you were not lead engineer at the osirak nuclear installation outside tikrit
you were never captured by the mukhbarat escaping to syria
you didnt spend three years in the abu dhan jail
this is absurd
you werent tortured
you didnt finally escape and arrive here in cairo with nothing
al fallari had two daughters
they were taken by uday husseins private guard
he never saw them again
he stares at the floor
that didnt happen
they never existed
he remains motionless
valerie watches him closely
i need names
of your colleagues in the weapons programmes
the lives of hundreds of thousands of your people may depend upon it
he looks up at valerie tears in his eyes i know tarif
i know what happened
he walks over to the window
slowly he takes off his jacket
his shirt pulls it off over his head and turns his back to her
hes been mutilated and burned all up his back
slowly he turns
you know nothing
traders are packing up
valerie hurries into up some rickety stairs and unlocks a graffiti covered door
inside she takes out the notepad her heart beating fast
on the page a list of names
she pulls a ruggedized laptop from under the bed and pushes the plug into a bare wires socket
she starts to type the names into the computer
mike at his desk
his secretary pops her head round the door
an analyst sits opposite scooter libby
hes so nervous he can barely open his eyes
the iraqis were trying to buy the tubes off the internet
they spent three million dollars weather proofing the tubes
plus the tubes are roughly twice too long
now you could argue that thats to disguise them you could saw them in half
thats sixty thousand tubes
mimes sawing i mean whew
saddams gonna get the mother of all blisters
libby stares unsmiling
wishing to god hed never started
the door opens and the analyst white as a sheet comes out
a couple of colleagues are waiting outside
how was it
dont make jokes
analyst drifts his way back to his desk
analyst swallows and disappears into the interrogation room
paul the chief analyst comes out of the stall
analyst is there throwing up in the sink
he thinks i dont know how serious it is
weeks and weeks of fifteen hour days weve gone back over and over it
ill handle this
scooter listens patiently to paul the chief analyst
and so apart from all the scepticism surrounding the specification the analysis from the iaea which i believe is numbered in the report
changes tack mr libby
energy department nuclear scientists are among the most boring people on the planet
they can talk about gas centrifuges until you want to jump out of a window
and maybe once every ten years someone comes along and says so tell me about gas centrifuges
thats literally the only time you should listen to these guys
if they say an aluminium tube is not for a gas centrifuge its like a fish talking about water
weve been over this data with you now five six times
we dont really know how you want us to play this
let me level with you here paul
i dont know what these tubes are for
from everything youre saying there could be something to this but very likely not right
may i ask a question
when you say we dont really know how to play this what do you mean
turns white im just saying i dont know how to say it any other way than that except you didnt say i you said we
so you and the others have discussed how to play these briefings
why does the cia feel the need to play these briefings
i mean that
i didnt mean what i just said
the last part
or other things too
im a getting a little confused you want me to come back
the temperature drops five degrees
you dont know why im here do you
in the united states invaded iraq and afterwards weapons inspectors discovered saddam was six months off enriching uranium to sufficiently high specification to make a nuclear bomb
he had fissile material
and not a single person at the cia from the dci down to the janitor had the slightest clue that such a program even existed
so now one decade on are you telling me that youre sure these tubes are not intended to create nuclear weapons
with intelligence nothings percent
ninety nine percent sure
you cant put an exact figure
you cant be that precise
but if you had to say could you say youre ninety seven percent sure
is there a three percent chance youve got this wrong
still pretty good odds
you like those odds paul
you willing to put your name to that
are you ready to make that call
i dont make the call sir
fixing him yes you do paul
each time you interpret a piece of data
each time you choose a maybe over a perhaps you make a call
and right now youre making lots of little decisions adding up to a big decision and out theres a real world where millions of people depend upon you being right
but what if theres a one percent chance youre wrong
can you say for sure youll take that chance and state as a fact that this equipment is not intended for a nuclear weapons programme
the analyst sits frozen
do you know what one percent of the population of this country is
its three million two hundred and forty thousand souls
were not machines
we look at the evidence we game it out
not everyone agrees all the time
its a process
its a process
and not everyone agrees
who doesnt agree
full military funeral in the rain
a hundred mourners from langley
a coffin draped in the flag a hymn is sung
in the bleechers the analyst from the meeting earlier pauses in the break between verses and squints through the rain at the bank of seats across the grave
over there is the langley top brass
next to him george tenet dci
next to him
of all people
joe turner the analyst from winpac
what the fuck is joe turner doing next to the dci
didnt you hear
friday the dci took him to the white house
he briefed the president on aluminum tubes
youre fucking kidding me
turner is over there singing the hymn rubbing shoulders with the good and the great
at the back valerie stands with a number of other agents mike and bill her chief
a lone bugler and marine drummer beat out a last post
a widow weeps
its a dead end
valerie walks with the chief and other senior agents away from the graveside
so weve got a list of names
the mukhbarat watch the scientists night and day
their houses are bugged
their friends are followed

a busy er
a female doctor shakes hands with grateful parents
she bends down to talk to a boy cast on his arm
valerie watches from a distance
a car park
the female doctor gets out of her car with grocery bags and goes toward her house
across the street valerie watches from a parked rental
as the doctor finds the right key she suddenly turns to see dr
is there somewhere we can speak
in the foreground some goth kids play with their ipods
in the window valerie and dr
sawsan al haddad sip coffee
how long is it since you saw your brother
i attended a medical convention over there
before that in he came here for an engineering conference
twice in twenty five years
we try to stay in contact
would you like to go back and see him
sawsan holds her gaze
you want me to become a spy
we need to ask saad some questions
do you think he would answer them
im a doctor
i work hard
im also a mother
i have a small girl and im all she has
we can help your brother
right now he is extremely valuable to us
and to saddam
the mukbarat watch him night and day
he could come here sawsan
hes an expert physicist
hed have a job his children his family would be safe
you your daughter could see him whever you want
can you help us
i wont do anything to help you
i dont know you
i would only do this for saad
then do it for saad
valerie watches her
what would i have to do
westerners mix with mid easterners
a tea trolley crosses the floor and disappears into a service elevator
the elevator opens and a tea trolley stops outside room
the door is opened by valeries colleague
it is wheeled inside
as ali signs cups of tea are poured
he carries one into the bedroom and hands it to sawsan who sits on the edge of a bed wearing a long black traditional abaya
there are two other agents there with valerie
one of them is holding a notebook
the pages of this notebook are fast burning
you write on them like normal but if you need to destroy them in an emergency
he whips out a zippo
sets fire to one
its gone in a flash
you have two of these in your luggage
now this is the only pen we want you to use
the other agent shows her a pen
the ink in this pen is visible for seconds
only when given the the correct chemical fixative can it be read
i am not taking any of this
if the mukhbarat find any of this they will do things to me you cannot imagine
tell me what you need to know
i will memorise it
maam we have very specific questions some extremely technical
you have different bones in your body
do you want their names in english latin or arabic
they look to val for a decision
she cant help but smile
the agents have gone
just sawsan and valerie
how do you feel
shes trying to drink her tea but shes shaking
val takes her hand and silently grips it
just remember if anyone asks you anything if anyone stops you stay calm and tell the truth
youre just visiting your brother
keep it simple and keep to the truth
except its not the truth
how do you do it
she searches valeries face
how do you be someone youre not
how do you lie to someone
to their face
how do you do it
valerie looks at her
before she can answer we outside ali checks his watch
knocks on the door
valerie and sawsan look up from the edge of bed
a taxi cab stops and sawsan is helped out by the driver
from a car across the street valerie watches sawsan rolls her suitcase into the terminal
at the door she glances behind her
and disappears inside
ali and valerie get out the car looking every bit like tourists suitcases sunglasses guidebook etc
valerie and ali enter the revolving doors and follow her at a distance across the shiny beige and gold marble floors
by the the check in desk for the gulf air flight to baghdad stand two moustachioed men in dark suits
valerie and ali have stopped in a electronic goods store
watching the flight desk on this side
valerie aims her zoom lens camera and as if appraising it as a purchase firing off some shots of the iraqi agents
sawsan reaches the desk and is stopped by the two men
they watch her talking to the men handing over her passport
the iraqi agent stares at her
he asks a question in arabic no subtitles
she remains cool almost disinterested
the men exchange sentences of arabic
valerie watches from a distance
at last they allow sawsan through she checks onto the flight
sawsan walks through to board the plane
valerie watches her finally disappear beneath a huge advertising image
ali kneels on the floor and begins his prayer to allah
she looks at her reflection in the window and the lights beyond
the hotel room earlier valerie sitting on the edge of the bed with sawsan
the answer to her question you have to know
know why youre lying
and never forget the truth
she pushes hard on the treadmill
pouring the stress out of her
cnn is on the tv above her
condoleezza rice on wolf blitzer
we read in the new york times today a story that says that saddam hussein is closer to acquiring nuclear weapons
slowly she stops running
turns the volume up
we do know that he is actively pursuing a nuclear weapon
that there have been shipments into iraq of high quality aluminum tubes that are only really suited for nuclear weapons programs centrifuge programs
and as we saw in reporting just this morning he is still trying to acquire some of the specialized aluminum tubing one needs to develop centrifuges that would give you
an enrichment capability
specifically aluminum tubes
theres a story in the new york times this morning
i want to attribute the times
i dont want to talk about specific intelligence sources but its now public that he has been seeking to acquire the kinds of tubes that are necessary to build a
its a coordinated leak
valerie on the phone soaked in sweat watches meet the press on cable
shes on the phone to mike in his office in langley on the phone to valerie someone in the ovp leaked to the new york times and now theyre across
the networks quoting the leak
theyre using the same words
its co ordinated
im coming home
is iraqs regime of saddam hussein right now a clear and present danger to the united states
there is no doubt that saddam husseins regime is a danger to the united states and to its allies to our interests
the problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons
but we dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud
from the wilsons a homely glow emanates
a dinner party
dirty plates red wine late night
joe val and their friends
joe is preparing to light a cigar
number one i always open the window and close the door
you can still smell it
you want me to roll up a wet towel
like a teenager smoking in his bedroom
maybe sandbag my study
whats wrong with the deck
you used to smoke like crazy when i met you
middle of winter
its minus ten degrees
the whole point put on a coat
help me out
the whole point of a cigar you gotta get a little winston churchill vibe goin
a crackling fire
musty books slippers
maybe a faithful hound
you cant be freezing your balls off in a goosedown alone in the dark
dont think churchill
think scott of the antarctic
he tosses the cigar down
she kisses his nose
honey joe thats terrific its about personal choice
im so proud of you
its joes personal choice to gas his kids
my father smoked cigars at the dinner table for forty years
and look at me
joe feigns a cough
joe slaps his sides manfully
later the conversation has turned to politics
it was on blitzer and meet it came from the times
judy the press
all over the news
the new york times
can i ask a dumb question
what is an aluminum tube
they have the tubes saddam theyre for centifuges
for was using to make a bomb
who knows what they are
everybody knows they are
the question is what else does he have
did you read about this valerie
i was in europe on business last week
i missed it
basically saddam bought all these tubes
and weve nailed him
we got them
theyre packed with uranium
theyre not packed with uranium
theyre for purifying it
the bomb comes later
its how you boil it up it to make the big one
look out israel
its a bunch of tubes
joe you know about this stuff what do you think theyre for
whats your hunch
all eyes on joe
he tales off his glasses
makes them wait
i dont know anything about these tubes
im not qualified
but i suppose the real question here is bill interrupts stealing joes limelight
its a pretext
of americans think saddam blew up the towers the table erupts in discussion leaving joe marooned
valerie spots it instantly as he broods
hes a threat
you cant tell me hes not a threat
if wed stopped hitler in the thirties joe sits there
hes not hitler
we put him there
it suited us
hes our fault
right on cue joe rounds on the hapless fred
have you met him
have you met saddam
have you looked him in the eye
did he threaten you
did he threaten to kill you
you dont know saddam
you dont know what youre talking about
joe gets up
joe walks out
whats for dessert
to himself i may be some time
im sorry fred
i thought we were just talking
what is this
meet the press
vals made a lemon meringue
try and stop me
valerie comes into the kitchen
sue follows her
that smells good
shall i get some bowls
we have a rule at home
no politics at the table
it always ends in a squabble
i mean nobody knows whats going on over there
at the end of the day who really knows
youre right sue
alone sawsan rolls her small suitcase across the polished floor past a group of iraqi soldiers
a saddam a like in a dark suit takes her passport
his eyes bore into her
in arabic its her
he takes her suitcase from her
he leads her out of the queue down a strip lit corridor and into a windowless room in bowels of the airport
he shuts the door
sawsan tries to control her breathing
hands search through her luggage
they unwrap a framed photograph of sawsan and her daughter smiling
the officer turns it over in his hands
the officer returns with her bags
drops them on the floor
a door opens
on the other side there stands a tall iraqi man
her relief is enormous
how is my little sister
i am so happy to see you
saad drives a battered dusty mercedes through the streets
ive a friend in security services
ive been a government employee for years there has to be some advantage
you can wait all day
sawsan smiles at her brother
an extended family of great uncles and aunts grand children and cousins greet sawsans arrival
getting out of the car she is surrounded by hugs and tears and laughter
sawsan removes the framed photograph of her and her daughter
it is cooed over then given pride of place on the mantel
sawsan and her brother are alone in the kitchen washing up after the big welcome home meal
his five year old daughter watches from the stairs fascinated by her american aunt
the house looks very different
its falling down
in they bombed government buildings here
the foundations are shattered
saad i need to speak he holds up his hand and shakes his head
speaking normally i have been meaning to repaint the exterior
saad keeps a finger to his lips
fear in his eyes
but it is difficult to find the time when i am so busy at work
but the gardens are still the same as when we were children
the gardens yes of course i would like to see them
sawsan and her brother speak low
he seems very nervous
they can help you if you get out to the kurdish zone
exasperated i am watched sawsan
if i drive even twenty minutes north of baghdad they will stop me
theyve given me questions for you
closes eyes how close is your program to a warhead
when and where is the first test scheduled
how much grade uranium do you have
identify other scientists in the program
sawsan contd who in the military controls the program
which of the opens her eyes what is it
saad stares at her in disbelief
they do not know
the program was destroyed in
the americans destroyed it they know that
how advanced is the centrifuge facility
which method are you using to separate fissile isotopes
this is insane
we dont have spare parts to keep a tank on the road
i have to work at a plant which develops fertilizer
the inspectors are back
they know this
they must know
coming and going
joe queues at security holding his shoes in one hand and a briefcase in the other
a tv screen nearby burbles over knowing these realities america must not ignore the threat gathering against us
facing clear evidence of peril we cannot wait for the final proof the smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud
ali comes in to valerie
puts a file on her desk
you need to see this
its snowing heavily
joe is met by a man in his s
how was your flight
ali follows valerie down the corridor
she has the file
we need mike to see this
joe sits on stage with three academic types
in the hundred seater auditorium just a couple dozen or so students
ambassador wilson is the last american diplomat to meet with saddam hussein
in when saddam threatened to execute anyone sheltering foreigners wilson appeared at a press conference wearing a noose around his neck declaring if the choice is to allow americans to
be taken hostage or be executed i will bring my own fucking rope
saddam backed down and wilson evacuated several thousand
he came home and was taken to the oval office where the president introduced him to the war cabinet as an american hero
thats not quite true
it wasnt the oval office it was the roosevelt room
valerie walks with mike and ali briefing him
sawsans brother worked with five hundred scientists at the safa factory
in it was blanket bombed by b s
hussein kamel saddams son in law kept the scientists together threatening to kill them if they tried to leave
but sanctions destroyed the economy and when kamel was executed in the team just drifted apart
theyre all say the same thing mike
a nervous history major stands
does saddam pose an imminent threat to national security
i havent seen the intelligence
im not qualified to comment
we have intelligence services working hard to assess just this
but i have met saddam
ive looked him in the eye so i can tell you what i saw
during a particularly vicious period of bloodletting in the late eighties saddam was asked by his foreign minister why he had executed a certain official who had been a loyal
he said he would rather kill a friend in error than allow an enemy to live
for me that is the mark of a monster
mr speaker the president of the united states
through a scrum of pumped up representatives an exalted george walker bush makes his way to the podium
speaker vice president cheney members of congress distinguished guests fellow citizens every year by law and by custom we meet here to consider the state of the union
this year we gather in this chamber deeply aware of decisive days that lie ahead
wed like you to have this coffee mug
and some pennants
for your kids
thank you so much for coming and speaking to us
joe shakes the kids hand and walks towards departures
joe walks underneath a tv screen playing we know that iraq and the al qaeda terrorist network share a common enemy the united states of america
joe looks up at departures aa dulles
resigned he looks at his watch
valerie mike ali bill all sit in jim pavitts office
so you got thirty nuclear scientists interrogated by iraqis inside iraq who are all saying the same thing
jim these people took a great risk to bring us what
i could have saved us the air fare the white house is getting
bill contd someone is cherry picking raw data and serving it up to the press as fact
and then they look to us to confirm it
with intent you know we can bark about this all night
but thats all were doing
you me all of us
were guard dogs
we can bark and bark but at the end of the day someones gotta listen
because its not our house
even if it is on fire
a tv in the corner of the starbucks concession plays today the gravest danger facing america and the world is outlaw regimes that seek and possess nuclear chemical and biological
can i get an american please
just a regular american
intelligence indicates that saddam hussein had upwards of munitions capable of delivering chemical agents
joe glances at the tv as he pays
from three iraqi defectors we know that iraq in the late s had several mobile biological weapons labs
joe sits amongst stranded passengers most asleep
on tv the president
joe sips his coffee
he looks tired
the international atomic energy agency confirmed in the s that saddam hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program and was working on five different methods of enriching uranium for
the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa
joe stares motionless at the screen
the only one awake
our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production
joe doesnt blink
this nation fights reluctantly because we know the cost and we dread the days of mourning that always come
we seek peace
we strive for peace
and sometimes peace must be defended
ladies and gentlemen flight to dulles is boarding immediately at gate
we apologize for the delay due to adverse weather conditions everybody wakes up
starts to move
joe stays seated
we americans have faith in ourselves but not in ourselves alone
we do not claim to know all the ways of providence yet we can trust in them placing our confidence in the loving god behind all of life and all
may he guide us now and may god continue to bless the united states of america
joe is motionless
staring at the screen
with some colleagues valerie in the mess watching colin powells performance in new york at the u
the nuclear program
she watches motionless
she looks at mike
saad sits in his kitchen while his wife plays with the children next door
he is watching the same thing colin powell in the u
he catches his wifes eye through the open door
slowly he shakes his head
our eye moves off across the tv past the photo of sawsan and daughter out of the window to the street outside
the end of a long day
slowly the shot decays in a time dissolve to in the full force of an air raid
many of the same buildings are gone
the whole world shakes and trembles as a paveway ge laser guided bomb streaks in and impacts
cars on fire
a vision of utter hell
a figure darts between burning cars clutching a bag of food amid the firestorm
he disappears into our building
our eye leaves the street back inside saad bursts in as another missile lands nearby
the building shakes
the picture of sawsan shifts
dust falls like fine rain over the small kitchen
saad unpacks food on the rickety table
under it his wife children cower
he passes down bread
the baby is crying
there is a knock at the door
on the other side are two men
what you doing
theyre watching no ones watching
i think the secret police have their hands full
free to be blown to smithereens
least no mukbarat gets to watch it
they all laugh at the gallows humor
and hug its good to see you my dear fellow doctors
saad children sleeping in bunks
the three nuclear scientists are drinking tea at the same table
my sister said the americans could get us over the border
and you trust them
open your eyes
and your ears
your american friends are calling you right now
the rumble of the now distant bombs
small arms fire
its our only hope
bill valeries chief walks to his car
valerie shouts after bill
they talk by his car
valerie is agitated
val every mobile exploration team is combing the desert looking for wmd
i cant all i needs a couple units were at full stretch val
to bring these men and their listen to me
families into camp lima and on an air transport into annandale
say we extract these guys
bring em home
put em on cnn

thank you oh and by the way there was no nuclear programme
theres no wmd
ps you all knew that
you want me to go to the dci ask him to sign off on his own funeral
i gave my word bill
thats not my problem
i got bigger problems
they stare at each other
valerie shakes her head
why do you do this job
the holiday package
to make a difference
to protect people
then one day you realize youre not superman
sometimes you fail
he gets in the car reverses and drives away
valerie hurries through the building
hold the elevator please
valerie is pacing
mike is sitting
what the fuck is going on mike
its like if there was a baby on the ledge up on seventh no one would get up and save it in case the white house wanted it there
this is just one snafu in a thousand we got right now
the scientists are these scientists are the wmd
if we cant protect them theyll run to the first country who can
and theyll put them to work
mike looks at her
i never said this
if anyone asks i deny any knowledge
then how quietly can you do this
a something heavy set woman walks past her down the corridor
valerie jogs after her
who do you have in baghdad
i need to get an rg to an asset in mansour
why dont your guys to do it
im asking you
saad runs pressing himself against a shrapnel pocked wall as a us army humvee blasting hiphop music passes
he runs low across the street and over a wall into a garden
i need to know my family will be safe
saad sits at a table speaking into an rg secure satphone with two liaison officers
my wife my children
they are all i care about
valerie sits in the communications room with beth
saad i know that
we will take care of your family
but we have to move fast
how do i know i can trust you

well if you see her say hi
he stops listen pete
i have a question
and its real important
is the president be referring to another african country
ive seen the inr
hes referring specifically to yellowcake from niger
it sinks in
pete listens nodding
his expression grows darker and darker
he listens what exactly are you proposing to do joe
i dont know
i dont know what to do
he takes off his glasses you want my advice
you already did your job
you did your best
you came home
end of story
yellowcake from niger
pete looks around
i dont have to go all the way to africa to know somethings fucked up here
three months and what have we found
you think somethings up here
join the queue
join the line stretches all the way from state to the pentagon and back
so why has no ones come forward
why you think joe

he pulls back listen
youre a smart guy

yes it is joe
now go take a long look in the mirror and say that again
joe puts the phone down
upstairs he can hear a child crying
rain streaming down a bedroom window
one of the twins is asleep
the other standing in her cot
joe scoops her up
jiggles her and comforts her
lays her back down
joe comes down the stairs
in the hall coat on soaking valerie
she looks beat
are you ok
valerie doesnt move
she stands there
then whats wrong val
im just tired
whats the matter
valerie shakes her head slowly

im going to bed
joe watches her slowly walk up the stairs
then stares at the space where she was just standing
let me finish
let me finish
joe looks at the tv
he sets his jaw
there are some who feel like that the conditions are such that they can attack us there
my answer is bring em on
computerized letter appearing on a screen
pixellated extreme close up joe writes what i didnt find in africa
did the bush administration manipulate intelligence to justify an invasion of iraq
the act of war is the last option of a democracy more than american soldiers have lost their lives in iraq already
we have a duty to ensure that their sacrifice came for the right reasons
a long line of satellite broadcast vehicles
a reporter talks to camera
others in the background doing the same
libby reads joes article what i didnt find in africa
he looks out at a line of satellite broadcast vehicles
retired ambassador joe wilson yesterday claimed in a piece in the new york times that the president mispoke in his state of the union address in january concerning claims that
saddam sought tons of yellowcake from niger
wilson who was acting ambassador in iraq during the first gulf war said fleischer on defence before a packed house buzzing
everyone has joes article
theres zero nada nothing new here
the presidents statement in the state of the union was much broader than the niger question
is the presidents statement correct
yes i see nothing that goes broader that would indicate that there was no basis to the presidents broader statement
but specifically on the yellow cake the yellow cake for niger weve acknowledged that that information did turn out to be a forgery
the presidents statement was accurate
we see nothing that would dissuade us from the presidents broader statement
so you believe the british report is true
card is at his desk watching the briefing on tv
sorry i see what david is asking
let me back up on that and explain the presidents statement again
hadley comes out of his office putting on his jacket
clear my morning
so it was wrong
let me do this david
on your specific question im going to come back to you
the reporters leap to their feet in uproar
rove tv on holding the article screams into the telephone
what is that tit fuckin homo fleischer doing to us
we need to get a hold of this
scooter comes out of his office
cathie martin is waiting

he goes into the vice presidents office
the secretaries tense
karl rove stands opposite libby staring
libby finishes reading something
this has become a trust issue for the president
we cant get behind this
we need to change the story
they look at one another in silence
then who is joe wilson
libby comes out of his office
he walks round the corner to roves office
roves secretary is still there
you still here
a piece of paper is put on a desk
rove picks it up
libby wathes him read
rove puts the paper down
we cant do this

a year old cyclist hurls newspapers into front yards
valerie sits on the bed in a towel
joe drops the newspaper onto it

valerie gets up and walks out
valerie dressed leaves the house
where are you going
valerie walks outside
in the window across the street her neighbour stares straight at her
valerie looks ahead
her eyes flick to the paper on a neighbours lawn the wall street journal
another neighbour getting in his car waves
hes thrown when she doesnt reply
val starts her car and drives
valerie stares straight ahead hands gripping the wheel
we watch her
her driving intercuts with her thoughts
flash the associated press news bureau add her story to the bullet feed
flash an ap feed winds around a newspaper news room
flash the reuters office in geneva picks up the story
flash a bloomberg tickers her name
valerie death white drives along the georgetown reservoir

flash valerie next to her husband in black tie shakes hands with a visiting dignitary
a camera bulb goes off
she eyeballs the cameraman for a moment
valerie turns onto the freeway
the pad falls into the footwell
she reaches down and her
same hand reaches to shake hands with flash different people in different countries dinners with diplomats meetings with captains of industry conferences in far flung corners of the world
each becoming a photograph on a file

the door opens
the director of operations enters with a fifty something woman

the news has spread fast
valerie enters an empty office
the door is closed behind her
on the desk is a notepad and a telephone
she picks up the phone
the phone isnt connected
she sits staring at the blank page
suddenly she gets up and walks out
at the end of the corridor the internal security guy follows

he breaks into a run
the doors close on him
valerie comes out of the elevator and walks fast
people looking at her
bursting into her office she sits

the head of the jtfis identity is classified for reasons of operational security
the shutters come down
valerie opens her mouth
i have a critical operation in baghdad in a major ongoing val
the children are playing with power rangers in the lounge
in the kitchen joe at home speaking on the phone
tv is on
two senior administration officials told me that wilsons wife suggested sending him to niger that means a vice president a chief of staff or top advisor
hearing the front door i gotta go
he hangs up
the twins run out of the lounge towards her
she goes into mom mode
give mommy a kiss
trevor wont let me borrow his power ranger
well did you say please
i said please
its not fair
they go into the kitchen
the kids fight for her attention to show drawings theyve done
i drew a clown and a theres a act states scarecrow
its a crime for a government official to intentionally valerie disclose a covert agent
carries a fine of fifty thousand dollars and or up to ten years in jail
that is one cool scarecrow
to samantha dont eat that sam
its a crayon
give it to mommy
joe watches her
he can see the tension of her face
how did it go
the phone rings
its been ringing all day
dont pick it up
whove you spoken to
joe who have you spoken to
he holds the phone out its lisa
valerie looks blind sided
ok who wants to watch tv
scoops them up and leaves us with val
she composes herself
vals friend lisa is in her lounge
her kids are playing
are you ok
whats going on
i read it
listen she steels herself im sorry
i cant talk about this
i cant make a comment on this right now
two other friends
you cant make a comment
your name is in the paper
it says youre a cia agent
next door the kids watch tv
i have to go
ill call you tomorrow
valerie hangs up
joe is standing there
your mom called
and your uncle
and janey called from chicago
i wrote them down
then and andrea mitchell called
she says white house sources say that quote the real story here is not the sixteen words but wilson and his wife
would i care to comment
yeah i fuckin would care to comment
she wants me on the show day after tomorrow
i dont want you to go on tv
joe sits stiffly on the set
a make up artist applies powder to his nose
going in thirty seconds
this is clearly designed as a shot across the bow to those who might step forward those unnamed analysts who said they were pressured by the white house would think
twice about having their own families names being dragged through this particular mud
i was sent to niger at the request of the vice president
i was not sent by my wife
the issue here is not who sent me here is whether a crime has been committed
youre saying a crime was committed it is a crime to reveal the identity of a covert agent working in the employ of this nations intelligence agencies
this is now a matter for the justice department pete
the justice department need to establish whether those in the highest office sought to destroy the career of a public servant to punish me for speaking the truth
the new press secretary scott mcclennan fields questions
first of all that is not the way this white house operates
mclennan contd the president expects everyone in his administration to adhere to the highest standards of conduct
no one would be authorized to do such a thing
will the president move aggressively to see if such a transgression has occurred in the white house
this is a very serious matter our administration takes it seriously
ive got all the confidence the justice department will do a good thorough job
i want there to be full participation because april i am most interested in finding out the truth
the kids are eating breakfast acting up
valerie is making breakfast
the phone rings

valerie sits there very still
valerie drives home past the capitol still
valerie gets out and sleep walks into the building
she joins a small group of mothers watching through glass door their children playing
one of the mothers nudges another and whispers something
they both look at valerie who tenses
her kids put their coats on and come out
valerie puts on a bright smile
kneels to hug them
brightly hey guys
how was your day
she carries them out watched by the other mothers
valerie bussles the kids out of the car
a neighbor is mowing his lawn
she tenses as he slows his pace to study her
another neighbor searching for his keys stops and watches her too as she takes the kids into the house
valerie and the kids come inside
the phone is ringing
silence your husband is a fucking communist
i hope you die you fucking communist whore
she puts the phone down
trevor wont let me go on his tractor
all at once the facade crumbles
valerie closes her eyes and is wracked with sobs
when she opens them sam is terrified
its ok honey
mommys just tired
she hugs her
samantha strokes her moms hair
valerie reads a storybook to her twins
so the caterpillar built a cocoon and it stayed safe inside for weeks
and when it emerged it was a beautiful butterfly
she closes the door on her sleeping children
she goes next door into she goes into her closet
removes a box
then she taps a code into a small safe and removes another box
alone valerie opens the first box
photographs of herself with her friends
valerie and her girlfriends all smiling back at us
holidays with the same friends
on a hen night
she opens the second box different currencies
credit cards photos of her with different people
half a dozen passports
a couple canadian
she looks at the photos
she puts them back in the box
carefully and shuts the lid tight shut
she looks at herself in the mirror
the doorbell rings and valerie gets up
valerie opens the front door
standing there is sawsan

valerie tries to take this in
sawsan steps forward saad has disappeared

valerie speaks quietly
we dont have him
sawsan closes her eyes
you said he would be safe
you said we would help
you promised valerie approaches
i trusted you
she turns her back and walks away
leaving valerie alone
valeries boss mike is watching tv with his wife and kids and her mother when the doorbell rings
he gets up
the front door opens
valerie is standing there
what are you doing here
mike steps forward and closes his front door
mike glances up and down the street
a garage door opens
valerie and mike step into his garage and fluorescent light flickers on to reveal boxes of christmas decorations etc falli
valerie who else mike
i dont know what youre talking about
she fixes him
eventually he shrugs
he shrugs you were right
its all about the scientists
we made a call
we passed your case files to liason
you know yourself were not great at this stuff
off her shock val mossad were already on the same page
mike contd theyve been trying to hunt these guys down since the invasion

how can you sleep when you know with purpose i sleep just fine
now carols mother is here
im going to have to ask you to leave
its called counter proliferation mike
she turns and walks out
valerie gets in her car
shuts the door
she holds her head in her hands and starts to sob
we hear the sound of a crowd cheering
joe wilson is on a panel before a crowd of about a thousand
at the end of the day its of keen interest to me to see whether or not we can get karl rove frog marched out of white house in handcuffs
and trust me when i use that name i measure my words
joe looks defiant
we came all the way from portland for this
your support means everything to us
youre a true american hero
the real heroes are in iraq right now fighting a war which was prosecuted on lies and falsehoods
a quick montage of joe being feted
it ends with joe in a huddle with a dozen or so supporters
my wife and i have never sought publicity
but i know when i tell her about how much support there was here today i know how thrilled and humbled shell be
a bright dc day
lunchtime office workers
valerie walks alone through the park
she sits down on a bench next to jim pavitt
thank you for coming here today
i wanted to convey my outrage to you in person
in all my experience nothing has disgusted me like this business
pavitt contd i know its not easy for you but i want you to know how much the agency appreciates your silence in the light of this matter
we know how damaging this has been to you
we cant afford for this knife fight to go on any longer
i get death threats every day
people threatening to kill my husband
hurt my children
i went to the agency and i requested security to protect my family
it was declined
because quote my circumstances fall outside budget protocols
if this is a knife fight right now sir were fighting it alone
pavitt starts to chuckle
joe wilson versus the white house
well all i can say is good luck
but as a friend i feel i should tell you that those men
he points down the hill at the white house
those few men in that building over there that small white house are the most powerful men in the history of the world
how much of a stretch do you think it would be for them to take on joe wilson
he looks at her
joes out there on his own valerie
but i know we can trust you
speak to your husband
he turns and walks off leaving her alone looking at the white house
joe and valerie are having supper
the tv is on in the background
joe is energized
valerie is quiet
the nightmare scenario of an attack on a major city is as real if not more real than it was a year ago
tucker carlson said yesterday that wilsons wife sent him on a boondoggle
said i needed the work
who needs to work for free
niger does have restaurants
reminds me alot of paris

you start making your point with all your might and i start shouting back except im the white house and i can a shout a million times louder
does that make me right
they lied val
thats the truth
by the time theyre finished here you wont know what that is
today special prosecutor patrick fitzgerald in charge of the enquiry into the leaking of the identity of a covert agent announced that he is convening a grand jury to investigate
among the blizzard of subpoenas issued are ones for the vice presidents chief of staff scooter libby and special advisor to the president karl rove
both men are under suspicion of having leaked the agents name to reporters in order to damage former ambassador joseph wilson a vocal and combative critic of the administration
it is believed that the president himself has been questioned under oath by the fbi
karl rove walks down a corridor past libbys secretary
libby looks up from his desk
karl tosses a heavy document onto the desk
findings of the select committee on intelligence
all five hundred pages and eleven pages of it
am i going to enjoy it
i know someone who isnt
a military parade
three hundred eighteen year old recruits
shining in the morning sun
look at the soldiers mommy
valerie and the twins join the small crowd and watch
valerie watches the american flag lowered folded and stowed
the twins are playing on a slide
valerie sits on a bench
when she looks back she sees joe approaching across the playground
he greets the kids hugging them
go and play now
and he walks over to valerie on the bench
joe carries a heavy brown manilla envelope
from it he removes a thick wad of paper and drops it on the bench
that is the senate select committee on intelligence
on page thirty six it says the former ambassadors wife offered up his name and includes a memorandum written by valerie plame which says quote my husband has good relations
with both the prime minister and the former minister of mines both of whom could possibly shed light on this sort of activity
ive spent a whole year denying just this
joe wait telling everyone wholl listen on tv
in the press
my wife did not send me on a junket
i didn t send you
i didnt have that power
you sent an email
the ssci found the email
i write hundreds of emails
why didnt you tell me
at no time in the past twelve months you never thought i didnt make the decision
i was asked to write a recommendation
what am i supposed to do
not say my husband knows about this
they have this now
they will call me a liar
it will stick
they have all the power here what do i have
joe wilson contd my word
you have to speak up
you have to go on record
joe you have to defend us
shakes her head in frustration
so what do you want me to do joe
go to the papers like you did
write a piece in the new york times
you know id have to submit it to the agency and theyll interrupting the agency
is this the same agency which wont give you protection for your children
is this the same cia thats erased your pension
wheres your loyalty val
to your husband or the cia
shouts louder its to my family
i put my family first
were you putting them first when you wrote that fucking article
people are looking over
the children notice
joe is stung into silence
im taking different routes to and from school
im looking in empty rooms
under the beds every time i come home
a home were going to lose because your work has dried up and your clients are running for cover
what has all this achieved
what changed joe
nods maybe youre right
maybe i should have kept my mouth shut
is that what your dad taught you valerie
that what colonel sam plame said
joe wilson contd a good american doesnt rock the boat
a good american looks the other way
they are both terribly wounded
he looks at her levelly
did you send me to niger
silence his business is struggling
hes on the slide
ill throw him a bone
was that it val
you pull some strings for me
you help your old man out
how dare you
did you send me
you think im lying to you
could i tell if you were
you fucking bastard
samantha is watching them
she has tears in her eyes
valerie goes over and scoops her up
and carries them off
joe is alone
the senate intelligence committee published information that showed joe wilson had lied about how he came to be sent to niger
he denied that his wife had any role in it whatsoever but a memo plame wrote on february proves otherwise
the senate intelligence committee let some air a lot of air out of joe wilsons overly inflated ego when it issued its first report on prewar intelligence
while the committee heaped most of its criticism on the central intelligence agency for getting almost everything wrong about iraq and weapons of mass destruction it pointedly rebuked the former
ambassador and his infamous mission to niger
joe in a suit comes out of his house
a gaggle of reporter is waiting they follow joe as he crosses into the street towards his car
shutters and flashbulbs firing
mr wilson do you still maintain the vice presidents office sent you niger and not your wife
mr wilson was niger just a free holiday
my wife did not send me
i didnt receive payment
it was not a holiday
it was a fact finding mission in the run up to a war
but the fact is no one wanted facts
are you against our troops mr wilson
wilson is it true you donated money to the kerry campaign
people are saying your wife does not actually work for the cia
is it true she was just a secretary at langley
joe turns round furious as if hes going to punch the reporter
he tenses his jaw
joe gets into his car
the questions roaring around him
valerie is alone
the question still remains who is valerie plame
was she really simply a glorified typist
well i think its really all about the money
were talking about a third rate cia agent who had a government salary and she had sent her husband to niger and he had come back and didnt give the
report to the cia but he turned it over in an op ed to the new york times
so she was already in the hot seat with the cia and so now shes all about the money
plus its come out that she was considered kind of a mediocre agent at best
joe puts a sheet on the couch
he looks around for something to use as a pillow
joe comes into the bedroom to get his pillow
valerie is lying in the bed turned away
he pauses in the doorway
we see valerie up close
she begins to speak
when we were at the farm training to be field officers they picked four or five of us and told us wed stood out
flash valerie kneeling blindfold in stress position
we were bound hooded and thrown in separate cells
they beat us
deprived us of sleep
all you had to do was give up the name of one of the others
just one name
for a glass of water
to avoid another punch
another hour in a stress position
flash valerie bursts out from under the water
gasps in a draft of air
they push you until they find it
til they find the point at which you break
because they have to know
you have to know
and one by one everybody broke
i never broke
she looks at him ive been in situations places where i was afraid
where if you made a mistake one tiny mistake at any moment
pause but i never made a mistake
and that made me feel special
i thought im different
you cant break me
i dont have a breaking point
pause i was wrong
joe comes over
he reaches out and touches valerie
immediately she gets up and walks out
alone he hears the bathroom door close
valerie packs the kids stuff up into suitcases
joe sits at his desk a book open
valerie puts the kids coats on
the study door is open
she knows joe is there but she doesnt look at him nor he at her
say goodbye to your father
the kids go into the study joe looks up
were going on a mystery tour
why arent you coming daddy
it hits him in the gut
he scoops them up
ill see you both real soon ok
in the hallway valerie waits
on the driveway valerie puts the kids in the car
inside joe sits there not looking as the car pulls away
valerie gets out of the car
the kids run to hug grandma and grandpa
valeries mom coralls the kids
who wants to make toffee apples
val looks downstairs
in the shop her father in an apron
well dont just stand there
come take a look
a wide workbench
tools in neat rows
valeries father an old man in a plaid shirt holds a sander
points to the table hes working on
i thought itd work in your dining room
i can see the great and the good of washington eating off this thing for years to come
just sanding her down then she done
calling down sam
i keep telling you
they have a table
valerie smiles at her dad who looks at her properly
well come here
joe walks across the floor
he shakes hands with three or four businessmen
they all introduce themselves
joe orders breakfast
hows your wife joe
he uses the waitress to change the subject
ill just have a strong coffee
im not very hungry
joe wilson contd to the other men so
how long are you in town for
joe washing his hands in the bathroom
he looks tired
joe comes out of the bathroom and walks across the foyer and back to his table
a woman is talking to his business associates
he sees who it is instantly looks concerned
can i help you
can i help you
im just telling these people that you sir are a fraud
this is a private lunch
please leave us alone
this man is a liar and a traitor
he is in the pay of left wing hate groups he is a democrat stooge and he is an anti war zealot
he has stabbed our troops the back
joe is trying to laugh it off
but everyone is watching
may we get the check
you have blood on your hands
you are a fraud and your wife is a traitor and a fantasist
leave my fucking table
how dare you talk about my wife
you dont know her
you dont know me
now leave my table
the table nearby are watching
to the next table ladies and gentleman
right wing reporter contd he likes to lie in the press and he likes to swear and insult women
i think we should leave
no really we should
shame on you
you call yourself a reporter
shame on you
to himself as she leaves youre a self publicising hack
joe storms away
out of the four seasons into the street he doesnt know what just happened
he hails a taxi
it tears past
he hails another
the driver drives
joe tries to calm down but in the back of this cab it all hits him and he starts to lose it
he looks sick
his head is exploding
the tension like a vice
he opens the window
he gets himself under control but hes white and shaking
the cab driver looks in the rear view
i see you on the tv
youre joe wilson
no im not
i see you on the tv
thats somebody else
i know you
my name is joe too
i am from sierra leone
youve been there right
you like freetown
joe looks out of the window
joe we both know freetowns a shit hole
the taxi driver cracks up
thats the truth
thats the truth right there brother
sierra leone is dying
the people at the top have too much power
way too much power
over there we have no truth
people cant see that from here
over here its a different world
joe stares out the window
i wouldnt be so sure of that
how can you say that
land of the free brother
home of the brave
joe looks sick
can we pull over
im going to walk
look keep the change
do you pray joe wilson
i give you this
it is my church maybe you come
and if you open a bible look john chapter eight
taxi driver contd then jesus said if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed
and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free
he smiles take care brother joe
and drives off
joe looks up
he is standing right outside the capitol
valeries father is teaching the kids how to lassoo a pole
they both want to go first
he tries to keep the peace
from the kitchen valerie and her mother watch
hows is he
oh you know
out in the field vals dad lassoos the pole
midges swirl in dizzy soups
out in the field samantha is trying to lassoo the pole
valerie comes out and joins her father on the porch
he suddenly points

those yellow fellas
yeah i see em
they both listen you hear that

they suddenly showed up last year
stops what are they called
i know their name
theyre called something
he wracks his brain anyway

they watch the birds
dad i think my marriage is over
the sun setting
samantha playing below
he nods slowly
i know my little girl doesnt say anything til she absolutely has to
tears come to her eyes
im the same way
and ive said that too
those exact same words
your mother and i were fighting all the time
i guess she was just plain tired of moving home
wasnt til i retired after years in the air force i realised we never had a home
germany singapore australia england
heck i can remember the day you were born in a freezing cold airbase outside anchorage alaska
you must have been to twenty schools
twenty different chances to introduce yourself
be someone new
but you turned out ok
a little too serious
always looking down the road
worrying where life was going to drag you next
but it made you tough
maybe tougher than i or your mother or anyone knows
he wants me to go on the record
like that would suddenly make this all go away
we cant even speak to each other
she shakes her head i cant see how this comes round
i just cant see it pop
he looks at her
with a serious intent
he speak low
what they did was wrong valerie
never forget that
valerie look at the floor as her fathers words sink in
say through some miracle you even get through this
you and joe are always gonna fight
hes a stubborn son of a bitch too
he dont give up easy either
a dark cloud comes over him
he speaks levelly
one day this country is gonna look back on these years and its gonna hang its head
its gonna weep
then its gonna stand up straight and walk on
he watches samantha in the half light still trying to lassoo the pole
i swear to god shes gonna keep at that until she licks it
he points to samantha
theyre tougher than we are
theyll piss you off from time to time but theyre built to last
joe sits surrounded by the statues of presidents and law makers
a janitor approaches
no reaction were closing
you have to leave
joe walks out
the capitol behind him
he walks away
a line of satellite vans a hundred yards long
libby is escorted out of the white house by security

military death toll in iraq exceeded this week and the presidents approval ratings are at the lowest point since he took office in
at a news conference special counsel patrick fitzgerald declined to comment about roves involvement

fridays charges stemmed from a two year investigation by fitzgerald into whether rove libby or any other administration officials knowingly revealed the identity of cia officer valerie plame
joe stands in his living room watching the tv
in a statement released friday afternoon libby said i have conducted my responsibilities honorably and truthfully
i am confident that at the end of this process i will be completely and totally exonerated
valerie is standing there
tries to cover his shock

hes taking the fall
he fixes on the screen
i bet theyve already struck the deal
he takes the fall
he gets pardoned
the decks stacked
i bet this doesnt even get to a trial
he looks at her and sways slightly
i dont care how angry you get
i dont care what they say about us
i dont care if you hate me
if they take everything away from us but they are not going to take this
they do not get to take my marriage
joes eyes fill with tears
im so sorry
tears fill her eyes
you did good
he looks her in the eye
shakes his head
i did it for me
she shakes her head
i know why you did it
she looks at him thank you
theres a thousand things he could suddenly say
and suddenly nothing as he fights tears
if i could give it back to you
if i could give you back who you were this is who i am
they clasp each other and hug and all the pain drains away
as they break she looks into her husbands eyes
so are you ready to fight
joe looks at his wife
his eyes filled with tears
valerie getting ready
she puts on make up
a grey suit
how many of you know who put the words in the state of the union address
arguably the most important speech the president makes all year
never more important when the nation is on the brink of war
joe steps out onto a stage
packed to the rafters
kids stand on window ledges others hang over balconies
how many of you know who put it in
how many of you know my wifes name
everyone in the hall
how do you know one and not the other
joe wilson contd how did the question move from why are we going to war

valerie sits in the back of a cab looking out of the window
public officials swear an oath to uphold the constitution
that is their duty
they must be kept to their oath

this offense wasnt committed against me
nor against my wife
it was committed against you
and if you ever feel angry
do something about it

saad smiles and shakes hands
his wife nervously shepherds their children

he is introduced to several men the last of which is manucher vaziri the arms dealer valerie was tracking

saad looks up at the state of the art facility
valerie gets out of the cab
she walks down the street past the gleaming government buildings
whether its a pothole at the end of your street or a lie in the state of the union address
ask the question
demand the truth
we see the capitol dome behind her
she begins to climb steps
democracy is not a free ride
man im here to tell you that
but its where we live
and if we do our job its where our children will live

a roar erupts from the auditorium
valerie climbs the steps
suddenly she is engulfed in flashes
dozens of photographers
she climbs the steps

she sits before a microphone
