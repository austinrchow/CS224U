written by jody hill a pervert in a trench coat runs along the edge of the mall
a group of old women is coming toward the main entrance
the pervert opens his trench coat and flashes the old women
the pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the skill of a navy seal
a family is walking down the sidewalk
the pervert opens his trench coat and flashes them
the pervert ducks behind a dumpster
he keeps running and sees a car driving by
the pervert flashes the car
the pervert takes a two step run sees another lady flashes her
he dives behind a car
then pops up and flashes another girl
its an all out pervert assault
the pervert then runs across the parking lot jumps a fence and darts from the property vanishing as quickly as a ninja who just perfectly executed an assassination
mark the mall manager walks by a group of women who were exposed to the pervert
they crowd around and complain loudly
ladies please were doing everything we can to handle the situation
nothing is more important to us than the safety of our shoppers
now in the meantime feel free to check out some of our wonderful back to school sales
excuse me for a minute
mark walks down the hallway that houses all of the business affair offices
he stops at the receptionists desk
have you seen ronnie
i havent seen him all morning
the mall manager quickly walks off
on the way he passes a janitor
ramon have you seen ronnie
the mall manager keeps walking
the mall manager comes into the surveillance room
its a small office with monitors that show the different security cameras around the mall
dennis a mall security guard with sunglasses who will not utter a word ever turns around in the chair
where is ronnie
white shafts of light sporadically shoot through the dark and we see images
a giant flashlight is inserted into a utility belt
mace is inserted in the other side
a walkie talkie is turned on
a taser is sparked
mirrored sunglasses are pushed over the nose
a garage door raises and bright light spills in
a garage door opens slowly and reveals a souped up orange golf cart
theres a siren on top that spins around
the man driving is ronnie barnhardt a stocky mall security guard whose expression reads all business
ronnie pulls out of the garage
heavy metal music
a group of anarchist skaters rages through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they see
a couple of them smoke cigarettes
one skater grinds over a bench
one kid ollies onto the hood of a car
another slams into an old man and knocks him over
meanwhile ronnie sits in his golf cart waiting
he looks eerily like mel gibson at the beginning of mad max
the skaters ride past a set of construction cones
one skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking lot
the skaters soar past ronnie who flips on the silent orange siren and gives chase
as the skaters ride through the parking lot ronnie pulls up and drives alongside of them
cop authority voice pull over to the sidewalk now
stevie the leader of the skaters yells back
fuck off ronnie its just a parking lot
sir pull over to the sidewalk hector another skater joins in
leave us alone
yeah skatings not a crime dick
skateboarding is not allowed on mall premises
pull over now
were not leaving
yeah fuck you
the skateboarders flip ronnie off and push hard to get away from him
ronnie guns it and an all out chase ensues
ronnie pulls up alongside of a slow skater
ronnie side swipes the skater forcing the skater to run into a trash can and fall
ronnie catches up to another skater
this time ronnie tries to hit the skater on the side again but he is too fast
ronnie swerves trying to get him but he dodges and ducks
ronnie hits the brake
the skater thinks he has escaped but looks up and sees that a car is in his way
the skater nails the car and is thrown over the hood
ronnie is back in the chase and only hector and stevie are left
ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely behind the two kids
ronnie rams hector over and over from behind
ronnie rams him again
hector goes swerving off and falls down hard
ronnie doesnt break his pace and guns it toward stevie
stevie is good
he turns and rides through cars ollies over parking blocks and through pedestrians
ronnie burns down the lane beside him
stevie looks behind and ronnie is nowhere in sight
hes in the clear
stevie turns back around and sees ronnie driving in reverse straight towards him
ronnie rams into the skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass
what the fuck are you doing
i was driving in reverse and trying to get you to flip into the back seat
that way i could handcuff you smoothly and take you in
you know never mind just get in the goddamn golf cart
stevie picks himself up slowly and hobbles toward the golf cart
ronnie is in the room with the monitors
the skaters sit across from him
theres a poster on the wall with the security guard motto observe and report
ronnie fiddles with his walkie talkie
it seems like we go through this every day
whats it going to take for you all to realize that i wont tolerate this horseplay and just do whatever you want to and dont worry about the rules attitude
ronnie i hear what youre saying and i just want you to know that personally it pains me to see you all worked up and i just want you to
know that im really sorry because you cant do shit and you can take your little rules and stickem up your ass you fuckin rent a cop
the skaters all start cracking up
yeah suck my dick
the skaters start laughing louder
thats funny guys
i try to be a mentor to the youth but it seems like you boys have gone straight past boydom to the land of street hardened criminals
im left with no choice
you call me rent a cop but i call myself the laws right hand
i see the crime
and i phone it in
and thats what im getting ready to do right now
ronnie picks up the walkie talkie and turns it on
he speaks into it
into walkie this is ronnie barnhardt over at carolina mall
come in over
this is officer douglas what do you wish to report
into walkie ive got a couple of trespassers who have been found skateboarding on mall property
can you send a black and white over to take these boys into processing
ronnie winks at the skaters
yeah ronnie were kind of busy today
i mean we got like three car accidents
ronnie picks up the walkie and whispers into it
into walkie what do you mean
ive got these guys red handed
im gonna need a car over here pronto
i cant hold them all day by myself
yeah like i said were awfully busy right now
i think you should probably just makeem promise not to do it again and threaten to call their parents or something
thatll get them
the skaters start laughing
into walkie sir i dont think you understand their parents dont care about them
this is a from one of your soldiers
officer needs assistance
yeah its not gonna happen
the voice fades as ronnie turns off the walkie
so as you can see the law is just one little call away
but im gonna choose not to use that tactic today
im gonna do something that i like to do from time to time and thats called handle shit myself
ronnie takes his pad out of his pocket
he begins writing
while i wont have you arrested today i am going to suspend each of you for one week
for those of you who dont know how this works here it is
this is official documentation
if you step foot on mall property it is considered trespassing
at that point i call the police they come down you go directly to jail
ronnie fills out the paperwork sets the suspension notes on the table
stevie looks down at it
he picks it up reads it balls it up and throws it at ronnie
the skaters start cracking up
you accepted it originally so it still counts
ronnie sits there while the skaters laugh
ronnie sits at a table with a cinnabon in front of him
across the table sits nell a chubby but cute girl who wears a cinnabon uniform
the couple holds hands and they have their heads bowed
dear lord bless this food that we eat and purify it with your salvation
also please keep ronnie safe as he works in your name to protect the customers and employees and store owners of the mall
and please turn your wrath on any sinners that try to hurt him and make them pay by burning in the eternal flames of hell
in christs name we pray amen
ronnie begins devouring his cinnabon
so whats on the agenda for you today
you know the usual
spot crime before it happens perform random acts of bravery save people from certain death yada yada yada
whats wrong ronnie
ronnie i know that you really want to be a police officer but you have to realize that things work out the way theyre meant to
im okay nell
thanks but really i mean im on the front lines right now
im livin it
your job is definitely more exciting than mine
of course it is but at least you dont have to wrestle with the demons at night
i better get going
ill see you after work sweetie
nell leans in to kiss ronnie but he pulls away
not at work nell
we have to keep up appearances we talked about this
and dont call me sweetie
ill see you after work officer barnhardt
ronnie stands up and walks off
ronnie stands in the middle of the mall and supervises the early morning mall walkers as they stride around the outer marked lane
its all senior citizens
slow it down
watch your speed there
this aint a race
hey second time slow it down
mark the mall manager walks up to ronnie
ive been looking all over for you
i havent been hiding but some things that i have to do are better to keep hidden from you and official eyes
trust me its best all around if there are no bodies to clean up
so you may or may not have heard but this morning several women were assaulted just outside the front doors by a crazy pervert
for the love of god
i know its horrible
you want me to phone this one in to the police
not just yet
see if we call the police theyll be a big scandal and something like that could kill what little traffic we have at this mall
what i need you to do is watch out for this pervert and if you see him try to stop him or quietly phone it in so we can handle
hold on mark
let me make sure i understand you
youre telling me to deny my primary objective of observing and reporting crime and at the same time youre giving me authorization to handle this case on my own
im just saying keep an eye out and keep quiet
so basically im in charge of this whole investigation
theres no investigation
okay mark ill do it but im gonna need a few things first
you cant carry a gun
well im gonna need a new title
something to instill fear in the criminal mind
how about director of mall intelligence
head of mall security
and it doesnt come with a raise
and the new title stays between us
thank you for this opportunity mark
i wont let you down
ronnie stands in front of a cadillac with a boot on one of his tires
a local news camera crew comes up to ronnie and the female reporter starts asking questions
excuse me sir but we would like to ask you a few questions
im sorry but i cant answer anything
we heard a report that an unidentified man was spotted earlier today exposing himself to several women
do you care to comment
im not allowed to comment on that situation
so you admit there is a situation
im trained to resist torture for up to hours you really expect me to break now
get real lady
to her camera crew were wasting our time here
lets go find some police to interview
whats that supposed to mean
it just means you wont find any police
are you telling me the police havent even been called
ewww alert the media
jesus well whod they leave in charge you
ronnie smiles like he knows a secret
why would they leave you in charge
first of all if there was a situation to be handled i dont see why you find it so goddamn ridiculous that i would be in charge
the reporter waves for her crew to start filming
setting a trap look there is no way youre in charge of this investigation
well for your information im in charge of this whole fucking operation
i dont give a goddamn if you believe me or not ms
hot fuckin shit news lady
im the first line of defense against this pervert
as the laws right hand im here so that people like you can live in your own little happy world and think places like this mall are safe and fun
im the defender of this war zone
just me and my goddamn flashlight
just then saddamn an angry middle easterner with shitloads of cell phones and beepers strapped to him comes running up to ronnie
you motherfucker you put a boot on my car
cop voice i warned you about parking in the fire lane saddamn
fuck you ronnie
take that goddamn boot off of my car
going into cop step away now
i pay good money to this mall
dont tell me where to park
sir i will be forced to take action if you do not step back
im gonna kill you
ronnie pulls out his taser and shoots saddamn
saddamn goes down hard and begins twitching
he is fucking out of it
ronnie goes back to giving the interview as if nothing happened
as i was saying the pervert situation here is real bleak
for all you people out there thinking of coming to the mall please for your own safety stay away
still fucked up i cant believe you tased me
to the man thats right and ive got another one waiting right here for you
brandi the make up counter girl globs on tons of make up
shes a hot girl who looks like shes spent a few sticky nights in the bed of a truck
ronnie stands back and watches brandi
finally he walks up to her
brandi looks up from her mirror and then goes back to applying make up
that color looks great on your skin
not just that color but ive noticed that all make up looks really good on you
especially the blue around your eyes
i bet it drives the men crazy
brandi glares at ronnie
i can say that because im taken
what do you want ronnie
im here on official business
see i dont know if you know this but i have recently been made head of mall security
did you hear about that
well im sure you will
its actually pretty huge news
but the reason i stopped by is to tell you that it looks like weve got a pervert on the loose
a real live psychopath who gains sexual gratification by exposing himself to ladies such as yourself
i just want to warn you to be careful when coming and going to work
okay got it
and you may not want to wear any of those skirts that you like to wear
you know what skirts
something like that could set him off
and for that matter you better not wear any of those little low cut top things either okay
especially with those black bras because you can really see them in the light
perverts really tend to notice stuff like that
okay see you later
ronnie takes off and leaves brandi still applying make up
the lights are turned off and the mall is empty
ronnie walks out with dennis
dennis man im glad weve got a minute to talk
theres no easy way to say this so im just going to come right out with it
mark offered me the position of head of mall security
i know this isnt easy for you to hear seeing as youve been here longer than me
but i want you to know that youre my best friend and im only going to accept the job if youre okay with that
well you should know ive already accepted and its too late to turn it down now
every ship needs a captain
so you were passed over
who gives a shit
dennis in time youll come to accept answering to me
remember there arent any leaders in friendship
dennis and ronnie shake hands
they walk out and lock the doors behind them
hey you want to go and grab a beer or something
dennis doesnt say anything and just walks to his car
yeah youre right
youre probably in no mood to party after that news
well try not to take it too hard
see you later buddy
ronnie leaves dennis and walks to his car
ronnies home is a shitty double wide at the very end of the shittiest trailer park in town
ronnie lives in a boys room
theres all kind of posters up with instructions on how to execute choke holds wrist locks and other assorted death blows
however the biggest decoration is a large diagram of the mall
ronnie stands in the middle of his room with his mom across from him
shes an old thick boozer with the strength of a father and the love of a mother
she downs a full beer and throws it against the wall
you think youre ready for a shot at the title motherfucker
im ready mom
ronnie and his mom take to fighting
ronnies mom is surprisingly good and she lands the first blows to ronnies cranium
whats wrong baby
is your pussy hurting
ronnie attacks his mom
he manages to scoop her and body slam her to the ground
ronnies mom flips out of it on the ground
however ronnie holds onto her wrist and stands up thus locking in the submission hold
ronnie flips the wrist lock tighter
you move with me you go down
you move against me and your arm breaks
let me go goddamn it
ronnie lets his mom go
she shakes off the pain
i cant believe you got that lucky shit on me
luck has nothing to do with it
you almost broke my arm
im sorry mom
are you okay
ronnies mom rubs her arm
ronnie drops his guard and comes over to tend to his moms wounds
however shes only playing possum
ronnies mom sees an opening and attacks ronnie at his legs
ronnie goes down and the two start wrestling again
note this plays as realistic as possible no phony punches or smooth comedy fighting it looks like a school yard fight video
sloppy and real
ronnie is laying in bed while his mom chugs another beer beside him
shes one eye closed punch me in the face drunk
theyre watching ronnie on the news from earlier
ronnie talks into microphone
yeah well for your information im in charge of this whole beep operation
i dont give a beep if you believe me or not ms
hot beep beep news lady
do you see anybody else
beep no you dont
as the laws right hand im the first line of defense against this pervert
im here so that people like you can live in your own little happy world and think places like this mall are safe and fun
im the defender of this war zone
just me and my beep flashlight
the female reporter addresses the camera over footage of no comment as to why steps are not being taken but this security guard feels like he is the only one
doing anything to protect the people who visit carolina mall from the suspect
for all of us i hope this isnt the case
back to you lindsay
ronnie turns off the television
drunken slur im so proud of you ronnie
do you think i did good
you were great
ah youre just drunk
nah you did good
yeah i usually dont come out to the forefront like that
my official orders are observe and report but when mark put me in charge of mall security something inside of me changed
its what ive always wanted
things havent always worked out with the whole
well you know
but this gives me faith that i can do something great
this is my call to duty and im going to answer
im going to bust this fucking pervert
i swear it on everything i am
anyway i better get to sleep
i got a big day tomorrow
good night mom
off no answer mom
on cue ronnies mom falls over in a drunken sleep
she starts snoring loud as hell
ronnie gets out of the covers and helps his mom onto the bed
ronnie tucks her in like a loving son
he pries the bottle from her fingers
then he grabs a pillow and goes to sleep on the floor
ronnie walks up to ocharleys
its the one step up restaurant thats in the mall
theres a bouncer out front who watches over the store
you working the door here
thats what they tell me
they needed to hire a little security here in case the drunks get out of line or whatever
kind of funny they thought they needed more security here
you do realize that if anyone gets out of hand you need to call me to handle the situation
i work for ocharleys not for the mall
granted but you realize that my jurisdiction supersedes any and all other forms of security when under the roof of carolina mall
you know i thought about getting a job as a mall security
i mean im kind of on extended vacation from college and its just like i dont want to do shit you know what i mean
my parents said i have to work if i want to live at home but i just dont feel like doing anything
this was the easiest job i could find i mean what the hell could be hard about being a bouncer in a mall restaurant
but now that i think about it mall security could be easier than this
my young friend you are sorely mistaken
do you know how much stuff im in charge of
thats not even counting the parking lot
i thought you just kind of chilled out and called stuff into the police
no way thats about like maybe percent of it
theres so much other stuff
two words friday night
what about it
its crazy lets just leave it at that
i like you but i dont like the fact that youre masquerading as an official in the security world
if youre serious about a career in the security world then perhaps i could look into getting you a job on my staff
part of my job is reaching out to troubled youths such as yourself
its who i am
does it pay more than
he leans over to the bouncer and whispers in his ear
ronnie stands back and winks at the bouncer
id say thats more than im making now
hold on this job involves a probationary period
you have to prove yourself worthy
we cant just hire any old tom dick or harry just because they want to carry a flashlight
what do i have to do
you have to complete a term as deputy
you will answer directly to me
your job will be to come and find me if you see any trouble
if this works out then i will phone the crime into the police
now this will train your eyes to spot various criminal activity
once you have completed your training you will be awarded an official position on my security staff where you will have the duty of actually phoning in crimes to the
so basically i just do what im doing now and then youll get me a job
how long does this mentorship last
until mark lets me hire another guy
can i smoke while i work
yes you can
sign me up
you keep that attitude up and youll have no problem making the squad
ronnie reaches into his pocket and hands the bouncer a mini flashlight
its a flashlight
get to know it
its your new best friend
until you get your giant flashlight
then that will be your new best friend
the bouncer takes it and puts it into his shirt pocket
okay look alive soldier
deputy time starts now
no more slacker attitude for you
ronnie walks away but after he takes a few steps he stops and turns
you know i remember when i got my first flashlight
ronnie goes into an emotional memory in his mind
ronnie walks away leaving the bouncer there alone
loud rock score fades to loud rock source
a tricked out toyota pulls up to the parking lot
the car comes to a stop and out steps brandi the makeup counter girl
brandi walks toward the mall to start her new day
as she crosses the parking lot and heads toward the door the pervert pops out
this time hes upped his attack and beats off staring right at her
the horrendous sight stops brandi dead in her tracks
she screams bloody murder
it looks like a rape scene
brandi cries in the makeup chair and is surrounded by a large group of mall employees
her makeup runs down her face as her effeminate coworker bruce consoles her
mark is working crowd control
to the crowd alright people shes doing good
were just gonna get her down to my office and everythings going to be fine so the best thing for you employees to do is just get on back to
your stations and you customers can go ahead and enjoy the back to school savings here at carolina mall
it was horrible
oh my god the thought of that disgusting i think im going to be sick
just let it out baby
he should be ashamed
i just keep playing it over and over again in my head
brandi please dennis has called the police and lets just take this down to my office
the department store manager comes running over
whats going on
a pervert attacked brandi is whats going on
are you okay brandi
but psychologically no
brandi starts crying hard
the department store manager pulls mark aside
did you call the cops
theyre on the way
brandi starts crying even louder
yeah we got to get her the fuck out of here
everybodys standing around and nobodys shopping
this is bad for business
im trying but she just keeps crying
ronnie comes running up on the scene
he looks like a man who ran a mile to get here
i came as soon as i heard
jesus are you alright
im fine ronnie
shes fine ronnie
this is one of the most heinous things ive seen
jesus i tried to tell you about the skirts
its not your fault you little fighter you
ronnies not mad okay
ronnie can you get her down to my office so the police can talk to her in private when they arrive
i cant walk right now
i feel like im in shock
ill carry you
ronnie reaches down and picks up brandi
she totally lets him
ronnie struggles and cant lift her
it looks dumb
oh fucking jesus
ronnie finally manages to lift brandi
he carries her out of the department store and down through the middle of the mall
a black unmarked police car pulls up quickly and stops directly in front of the main entrance to the mall as if to say to the world im a cop
and i can do this
out steps detective harrison a young cop that has the arrogance and swagger of a man who is just beginning to feel his power
mark sits at his desk while ronnie comforts a crying brandi
dennis stands in the corner not saying a word
detective harrison knocks as he comes in the door
your secretary told me to come on in
im detective harrison cabarrus county police
detective harrison shows his badge to mark
the two men shake
mark talbert i manage the mall
this is brandi shes the one who saw the deviant
are you doing okay
im really shaken up
yes maam im sure you are after all youve been through but im here to tell you that were going to work together to make sure we catch the person
who did this
my name is ronnie barnhardt chief inspector on the case and head of mall security here at carolina mall and this is my lieutenant dennis
from one law enforcement officer to another i just want to welcome you and say that we will do whatever it takes to coordinate with your department in order to
bring this assailant to justice
the detective pauses as if hes unsure what just happened
back to brandi okay brandi
did you get a look at the suspect
yes i did
did you get a blood sample
thats a shame
would have been useful
go ahead detective
brandi can you remember anything specifically
what color was his hair
was he tall or short
he was tall and skinny and he had brown hair and it was real greasy
detective harrison begins writing in his note pad as brandi speaks
ronnie notices this and picks up some paper and begins to write as well
was his hair long or short
it was long about to his shoulders
did he say anything
no he just stood there and you know touched himself
what was he wearing
just a brown trench coat
this is what i got so far
ronnie holds up his paper
ronnie has drawn a crude sketch of the pervert that brandi described but its basically a long haired stick figure with a penis
whats yours look like
i just wrote a description
ronnie puts his sketch away
okay brandi i think thats good for now
i think the best thing at this point is to just follow up with the other ladies who saw the perpetrator yesterday and see if they remember anything
what if he comes back
thats highly unlikely
these incidents are usually random and unpredictable
im sure youll be safe
im afraid im going to have to disagree with you there detective
by my math it seems pretty clear that brandis been targeted
what gives you that impression
well how about the fact that she was the first employee to get assaulted
not to mention the fact that she is the prettiest girl who works at this mall
to me it seems obvious that this is some sort of methodical villain that plans on returning to finish what he started by murdering brandi
is that going to happen
thats not going to happen
ronnie looks at brandi and nods his head yes
well dont worry
im on the case and im going to do everything in my power to bring this guy down
thats right brandi youve got the best team in law enforcement working for you
look ive got to get going
heres my card
ill even write my home phone number on the back just in the event you need to get a hold of me
detective harrison writes his number on the back and then hands his card to brandi
give me a call when you arent working and ill have you come to the station to look through some mug shots
touches her leg dont worry okay
i feel a lot better now
ronnie holds out his hand
ill take one of those cards as well
detective harrison reluctantly hands ronnie a card
go ahead and write your home phone on there as well in case i need to get a hold of you
you can just leave a message at the station
i check my messages constantly
sorry but im gonna need those digits
if were gonna solve this crime we need to constantly be in communication with each other and have an open door policy with intelligence
brandi let me see that card
ronnie takes the car from brandi and copies the home phone number from the back
cool ill call you later with an update
dont do that
its no problem at all
were brothers of the badge
this is what we do for each other
detective harrison takes off
ronnie looks around happily
seems like a good guy
a little green but still solid
the mall is winding down for the day and most of the customers have gone home
ronnie walks through the mall taping up pictures of the sketch he made of the pervert
nell comes walking up with her apron over her shoulder
what are you doing
just putting these posters up
youve been so obsessed with catching this pervert ive barely seen you
thats what its like when you date the head of mall security
the downside is we dont get to see each other as much but the upside is you get to brag to all your friends
well are you ready to go
sure lets take off
the local news is on and they show an update on the mall flasher story
the sound is off
the living room is dark
ronnie and nell are on the couch making out
ronnie is starting to get frisky
his hands go to nells boobs but only outside of the shirt
she allows it
ronnie decides to push it
he takes his hand and tries to go up her shirt
nell immediately stops kissing and pushes ronnie away
what are you doing ronnie
come on let me get some of those big bazoombas
ronnie goes in hard for the tits but nell pushes him away
goddamn it are we ever gonna do it
you know we talked about this
we did its just well im tired of just doing what we do
im ready for something bigger
like sex or just maybe using a finger on you ronnie you know im saving myself for marriage
i thought you were okay with that
well i used to be its just
i dont know
whats so great about being a year old virgin
nell stands up and starts to put on her coat
ronnie stands up and tries to comfort her
nell im sorry
dont go away like this
i thought you loved my purity
i really do
im sorry nell
i should leave anyway its late
ill stop by for breakfast tomorrow
see ya tomorrow
nell leaves and ronnie closes the door behind her
mom wake up
lets go to bed
ronnies mom groans
she has been passed out on the floor with an empty bottle of jack d beside her the whole time
the lights are off and a gloved hand breaks into a case in the jewelry store
all of the diamonds and gold are picked up and pocketed
someone is robbing this bitch
ronnie strolls through the mall sipping on his morning coffee
he stops when he sees that the jewelry store has been broken into and robbed
ronnie goes running down through the mall
dennis and ronnie are sitting and mark stands over them
theyre looking at the security tapes
detective harrison knocks on the door and walks in
ronnie stands up to greet him
good to see you brother
looks like the old team is getting together to crack one more case
ronnie gives detective harrison a hug
im ready to go to war with you
thanks for waking me up this morning ronnie
ive already checked the security tapes
they didnt catch a thing
someone must have broken in here and turned them off
my team just checked all the doors and there are no signs of forced entry
ive also checked out the crime scene but we didnt see any fingerprints on the glass
the suspect was probably wearing gloves
that doesnt sound good
how did they do it
my guess it was an inside job
probably someone who has access to keys like a janitor or a security guard
detective harrison can i ask you how long youve been a detective for
im almost at the end of my first year
just as i thought a rookie
ive been a police officer for several years
yeah youre a rookie okay
its fine youll learn with experience
and when you do youll discover that rule of law enforcement is that you dont ever turn on a fellow officer
now i know you would never actually accuse somebody on my security force of committing this act of lawlessness
whoever did this would have to had keys to the security room so they could shut off the camera
look my record speaks for itself and as for dennis well i can certainly vouch for him
dennis is one of the finest men i know so just take my word youre barking up the wrong tree
now lets put this little squabble behind us and get back to busting the guys that robbed this mall
ronnie nobody is accusing anybody but i would like to stick around for a while and interview some of the employees
okay but all i ask is that you do it quietly so that the hoopla is kept to a minimum
i understand too sir
ronnie you are to leave detective harrison alone and let him handle the investigation
no can do mark
when you appointed me head of mall security i swore an oath to protect this mall and aid in bringing crime to its knees
you didnt swear an oath
to myself i did
ronnie on these types of investigations its usually not a good idea to have too many cooks in the kitchen
theres only one cook
im a chef
a cook and chef together serving up justice
im gonna do this alone
hot plates of justice
ronnie stands up
come on rookie
let me show you the lay of the land
ronnie talks to dennis in the middle of the mall
ive gotta hang with detective harrison
what i need for you to understand is that just because detective harrison is here doesnt mean that you and me are no longer best friends
sure harrison would be cool to hang out with
he carries a badge and a gun
he probably owns a boat
over time well probably become really close like brothers but for right now youre still number one
now i must leave you behind because duty calls so
radio if you need anything
ronnie takes off but we stay with dennis
he walks directly to the arcade
dennis puts a quarter in the machine and plays pinball
ronnie watches from afar as detective harrison interviews saddamn who stands in front of his cell phone kiosk
so have you seen any suspicious people hanging around the mall
anybody who might have been casing the stores
i aint seen nothing
okay well if you can think of anything heres my card
detective harrison hands saddamn his card and begins to leave
disgusted ronnie comes walking up
to harrison my turn rookie
what are you doing ronnie
solving the whole case right before your eyes
ronnie this is official police business
what the fuck you want ronnie
i want your ass to face the music is what i want
dont come any further bitch
the restraining order says feet so just back the fuck up
ronnie i appreciate your enthusiasm but just let me handle this
to saddamn have a good day sir
so youre just gonna let him slip right through your fingers
i have no reason to make him a suspect
look at him
theres every reason in the goddamn book
why are you saying that man
i think its obvious saddamn
thats fucked up
youre racist man
youre not even black
were finished here
now if youre going to tag along im gonna need you to just stay back are we clear
detective harrison walks away
ronnie follows but takes one more look at saddamn who flips ronnie off
saddamn goes back to hollering at girls
whats up girl you got a boyfriend
free cell phones with a month trial and i throw in my phone number for free
ronnie stands nearby as detective harrison questions an old mexican janitor who stands by his cart of cleaning products
did you let anybody borrow your keys
have you seen anything suspicious
thank you for your time
alright i believe i can be of some assistance here
ronnie we talked about this
this is a special circumstance
what special circumstance
communication skills watch and learn
ronnie steps into the forefront
long drawn out conversation in spanish
more spanish dialogue
to harrison yeah this guy definitely did it
what did he say
i dont know i dont speak spanish but judging from his tonal inflections its safe to say that hes hiding something
the only question is where
to janitor okay ramon im giving you one chance and one chance only to come clean
or else detective harrison is going to come over to your house and deport your whole family back to mexico
no im not
good cop bad cop just play along
to ramon where are you hiding the jewels
alright youre gonna make me be the bad guy here
well thats a role im comfortable playing
lets just see what youre hiding
ronnie digs through the trash bin that is on the cart
ronnie slings trash out all over the floor
he finds nothing
ronnie thats enough
think youre pretty slick dont you
im pretty slick too
ronnie takes the cleaning products and opens the bottles
he pours the contents out on the floor
whats he looking for
alright youre free wait a minute
ronnie takes the mop and breaks it in half with his foot
he takes the halves and shakes them thinking that something will come pouring out of the open cylinders
okay my mistake
sir youre free to go
uh you might want to have someone clean this up which in this case is you so uh chop chop
wouldnt want anyone to slip on this mess
ronnie leaves the janitor with a bewildered look
ronnie follows detective harrison into the lingerie store
they approach the counter where a hot clerk is working the register
hello can i help you
im detective harrison with the cabarrus county police
and im ronnie barnhardt head of mall security
okay seriously would you back the fuck off
im trying to do my job and youre fucking it up
come on were working here
detective harrison is seriously annoyed
back to the clerk sorry
im doing a check with all the mall employees to see if anybody has any information on the robbery that took place here last night
im sorry but i havent noticed anything out of ordinary
a sexy worker comes up to them holding a scandalous pair of undies
tracy do you think my boyfriend would like these
the sexy worker holds the undies up to her crotch
ronnie looks and his tongue almost drops out of his mouth
he straightens himself out
thats fine thanks for the help
youre gonna let them distract you with a little bit of panty showing
you have got a lot to learn my friend
to the hot clerk who are you protecting toots
what are you talking about
look im sure you and your little friend have made a real lifestyle for yourselves here
its probably easy for you to blind most men with your beauty but im not most men
i can see through the sexuality to the truth
jewelry gold diamonds you dont really expect me to think that a man wants that crap
im putting you on my list of top suspects
i dont think you did the crime but i do think you are an accomplice
im sorry maam
hes not with me
heres my card
if you think of anything just give me a call
detective harrison walks out and ronnie follows him
on the way out of the store ronnie passes a man who is looking at the underwear
you should be ashamed of yourself
ronnie gives him a warning look then walks out
ronnie and detective harrison stand across the counter from a tattooed salesman
is that pot i smell
shut up ronnie
if i find you doing drugs or killing cats or whatever you devil worshippers do ill come back here and bust you
i swear to god
get the hell out ronnie
im here to ask questions about the robbery
just forget that were on to something bigger here
back to the tell me more about this sage
ronnie and detective harrison are in the hardware department talking to the sears manager
detective harrison sits on the ground
he has completely given up on the investigation at this point as ronnie controls it all
ronnie picks up a hammer
now maybe im crazy or maybe im the smartest man alive but it seems kind of convenient to me that you sell hammers like this one that could easily be
used to smash a glass case in oh say a jewelry store
couldnt you smash the glass with anything
you really think youre gonna talk your way out of this one
ronnie is hanging out with dennis and the bouncer from ocharleys
behind him nell works the counter at cinnabon
you guys should have been there today
we were just solving shit left and right
i mean thats what this job is supposed to be like
busting loiterers and kids who steal pennies from the fountain has its rewards but really getting in there and closing cases is where its at
its rewarding too because at the end of the day you know youve done something good for the world
what are we doing here ronnie
i thought you said they were giving away free chick fil a sandwiches
well what is your name anyway
well my young apprentice
i called you here today because as head of mall security i have decided that its time to take protection to the next level
in other words i alone cannot combat this recent crime wave
in order to help me in my personal journey i have decided to divide up the tasks between my soldiers
so for now on dennis my right hand man you will be in charge of solving the case of who is robbing the mall
little chucky you will be on the case of the pervert
you are both to collect data and provide it to me
i will analyze the data draw conclusions and solve these crimes as well as coordinate and strategize with various law enforcement agencies
since were going to be doing a lot of the work and youre going to be solving the crimes do we at least get paid
you cant measure honor in dollars and cents
ronnie looks over at the cinnabon and nell waves to him
ronnie smiles back and waves at nell
is that your girlfriend or something ronnie
what do you think of her
shes not my type but thats just me
yeah but you dont think shes kind of hot
are you blind
give me a break
wait are you sure shes not your girlfriend
theres no way id date that
person whos obviously not hot
nell waves again but ronnie just kind of turns away ignoring her
anyway our new unit will operate under the name special elite task force
you will answer directly to me and no one else
now lets all put our hands in the middle and do a unifying cheer
ronnie puts his hand out
dennis puts his in as well
charles isnt sure
youre gonna hook me up with a job right
charles puts his hand in as well
one two three task force
ronnie is the only one who gets into it
its a weak ass cheer
okay so now i say we all take a celebratory trip to sears because as we all know today is half price day on all automotive parts for mall employees
the elite task force walks down the mall as if they were the baddest ass kicking team on the planet
they walk united and unopposed
ronnie tacks up pictures of all of the robbery suspects on a bulletin board
its pictures of saddamn and the devil worshipper guy
beside him is a sketch of the pervert
the images are on the bottom points of a pyramid
on top of the pyramid is a combination drawing picture of ronnie
the body is drawn with his arms folded across his chest and a photo of his face is tacked on top
the whole thing adds up to nonsense with the only clear idea is that he defeats them all
ronnie sits back in his chair and stares at the board
all of a sudden there is a knock at the door
the door opens and brandi peeps her head in
sorry to interrupt
its no interruption
what are you still doing here
i had to do inventory tonight
bruce took off early so im the last one
hey i was wondering if you would mind walking me to my car
you know just in case that freak with the dick is out there someplace
it would be my honor
ronnie stands up and walks out with brandi shutting off the light as he leaves
ronnie and brandi pull up to brandis car in the golf cart
alright thanks for the ride
just doing my job with a little something extra especially for you
see ya tomorrow
i was just thinking would you like to go to dinner this weekend
how come every time somebody does something nice for me they act like i owe them a blow job
look its not like that
ive got a girlfriend
who doesnt work in this mall
ronnie i got to be honest with you youre not really my type
just out of curiosity what is your type
or guys who are really hot
yeah i guess thats not me
ill go out to dinner with you on one condition
this is not a date
do you understand
were going to dinner but we are not going on a date
and you can never tell anybody we went out
my lips are sealed
you pay for dinner right
and as many drinks as i want
you may drink your fill
and you have to drive me to my car every night after work for the next six months
you got it
and my car is low on gas so i need some money to fill it up
ronnie takes out his wallet
ronnie takes out more money and hands it to brandi
she takes it counts it and puts it into her bra
okay you can pick me up after work on saturday
dinner and thats it
dont try to kiss me because ill smack the shit out of you
its not a date
not a date
thanks for the ride
brandi climbs out of the golf cart and walks to her car
she opens the door and starts to get in hey brandi
it is a date
before she can argue ronnie guns the golf cart and drives away
ronnie sees stevie and the skaters doing hand rails down a ramp while mall patrons try to get by without getting nailed by flying skateboards
ronnie drives up on his golf cart
our suspension is over
im not here for that
i need to talk to you
a giant bodyguard with a shaved head stands up
anything you want to say to stevie you can say to me motherfucker
who the fuck are you
this is my cousin roy
hes a boxer
you got a fuckin problem bitch
ronnie reaches into his belt and produces a can of mace
he sprays it into the eyes of the bodyguard
the guy goes down and starts screaming in pain
jesus ronnie what the fuck are you doing
i need a favor
as you know weve had a lot of crime around here lately
between the flasher and all the break ins ive decided to go to the streets
frankly im looking for a stool pigeon and youre just the right person
why would i want to help you
i could make it worth your while
you like skating at the mall
i could allow you to skate here whenever you wanted
in exchange you keep your eyes peeled and provide me with any information you come across as to the identity of the perpetrators
sorry dude but im no snitch
go find somebody else to do your dirty work
well let me put it another way
if you dont help me im gonna spread your little butt cheeks and stick this flashlight up your ass
but like for real
like i really will do that
this is the new me talking and i get what i need you understand me stevie
alright dude i understand you sick fuck
in that case have fun shreadin
ronnie gets into his golf cart and drives off
stevie looks down at the boxer who is still on the ground
stop crying roy
stevie starts skating
ronnie walks into the food court and sees nell waiting at their table with ronnies morning cinnabon
he takes a deep breath and heads over
hey sweetie oh im sorry good morning officer barnhardt
good morning nell
where were you last night
i tried to call but your mom said you werent home from work yet
look i got to talk to you about something
im not really sure how to put this
if you drove a toyota
i drive a ford
i know but lets just pretend you drove a toyota
now this toyota runs really good
it always starts when you need it to and it gets good gas mileage and you dont have to do much to maintain it
then you get a really important job like astronaut no that wont work you get a job as the head of wall street
well you may really like that toyota but youre going to feel weird about driving it to work every day right
now lets say that somebody offers you a chance to get rid of that toyota and instead you get a ferrari
it may be more expensive and harder to drive but i mean it just looks good as hell
what would you do
i dont get it
you would trade up nell
well thats exactly what im doing
are you thinking about getting a new car
no nell im getting a new girlfriend
this girl brandi
the slutty girl who works at the make up counter
yeah i mean no shes not a slut
but youre thinking of the right person
how could you do this to me
i dont mean to hurt you
its just well i believe in this world you play the hand youre dealt and at this point in my life ive been dealt five aces
id be a fool not to bet
why are you doing this ronnie
i have to nell
dont you love me
of course i love you
then tell me why
because ive never dated the prom queen before
remember when you started this job
you werent such a hotshot then
ive stood by you when you were at your worst
every time you fell i held your hand and told you everything would be okay
time and time again
why do you have to bring that up
i never cared about who you wanted to be i fell in love with who you really are
if you leave me ronnie i wont be there to pick you up when you fall
even if i do fall it wont matter because im learning to fly
ronnie stands up and walks away
nell sits there sad
she looks down at her cinnabon and devours the whole thing
ronnie looks through a clothing rack
its full of cheap fabrics lots of imitation silks and shit
a slick salesman approaches ronnie
can i help you sir
yeah um ive got a really special date tonight with a hot young lady do you know brandi
anyway i need something thats really cool
something that will impress her and i guess you could say im not exactly in the know with what the hipsters are up to these days
are you looking to fall in love or are you looking to get laid
um i guess love but uh
you want to get laid too
watch it man
shes a lady
alright i got just the thing
something classy is what you want
show her youre a man with taste
ronnies mom sits on his bed with a bottle of wild turkey
she waits for ronnie to come out of the closet
come on ronnie just get out here
its too tight in the butt
let me see
ronnie comes out of the closet and hes wearing a ridiculous fucking outfit
its an imitation silk button up with a pair of black parachute pants
theres two belts for some double belt action
hes got no socks on and a pair of white shoes
he looks like a goddamn fool
ronnie you look so handsome
really you dont think i look like a phony
you look like a stud muffin
yeah i guess these clothes are kind of cool
nell is a lucky girl
its not nell mom
really i thought you and nell were going to get married some day
i did too
but then i met this girl brandi and she swept me off my feet
well i always liked nell but as long as youre happy ronnie thats all i care about
i actually feel kind of bad about nell but i figure that i can pour all the sadness into brandi and just really rely on her for my happiness instead
that sounds wonderful
is she pretty
she is mom
shes the most perfect girl in the whole world
i remember when your father picked me up for our first date
i swear he was the most handsome man that i had ever laid eyes on
i knew right then and there that this would be the man that i married
i hope that happens tonight
it will ronnie
then youll have to give her a ring like the one your father gave me
ronnies mom holds up her finger for ronnie
its a giant yellow cottony looking diamond ring
is that a yellow diamond
its a glass diamond
this is how it looks now
mom why did dad leave
well he kind of freaked out when you were born
you had so many special needs that he just couldnt handle the pressure
one day he just couldnt take it anymore
do you think it was my fault that dad left
you dont think it was mine do you
well i didnt know with the drinking and all
nope it was all you
i love you ronnie
i love you too mom
the restaurant is the cheesiest of all sea food restaurants
think one step down from red lobster
ronnie sits across the table from brandi
she chugs one of those giant frozen drinks killing it in one gulp
damn that was pretty impressive
yeah works been pissing me off so i just need to blow off some steam
well brandi can i just say that you look absolutely beautiful tonight
yeah i know
calling to waiter nurse
get me another to ronnie you got this right
bring me another and keep em coming
to ronnie i think its funny to call the waitress nurse
ronnie takes a pill bottle out of his pocket
he opens it up and pops a pill
hey whats that
oh its nothing
dont be stingy what the fuck is that
its just a pill im supposed to take
let me see
ronnie hands the pills to brandi
where the fuck did you find these
damn ronnie klonopin
this is the good shit
i didnt know you partied like this
yeah i guess i party like this every four to six hours as needed
let me get one
brandi pops a bunch of pills
so how do you like working at the mall
i hate that shit
all i do is listen to bitching all day long
i got to put makeup on these fat ass women all day and its like i dont give a shit what you do you cant polish a turd
yeah i see how that could get to you
lets do some shots
waiter four shots of jager
thats a lot
so brandi i hope im not being too forward but do you have a boyfriend
ive got a few hook ups but nobody who is a boyfriend
you know its just like a time in my life where i want to be free right now and think about myself
not get tied down to one person
yeah i understand
i hate ties
i recently cut mine and now im free like a bird
the shots come
alright bottoms up
ronnie holds up a shot to toast
to new beginnings
right up your ass
brandi downs her shot
ronnie takes his shot
im sticking to beer
whats wrong is your pussy hurting
god you remind me so much of my mother
brandi knocks back the other two shots
feel the burn bitch
you are so beautiful
ronnies car is a piece of shit subaru
brandi is shit faced and yelling at people out of the window
who wants to see my titties
brandi lifts up her shirt and shows the passengers of other cars her boobs
brandi this is the most fun ive ever had on a date
for the last time this aint a date motherfucker
this is a party
um so brandi its no secret that im attracted to you
i think everybody in the mall is
as you know i recently split with my girlfriend and basically i was wondering if since you dont have a boyfriend that i could maybe be your boyfriend and you
could be my girlfriend
thats my house
ronnie hits the brakes
ronnie opens brandis door and helps brandi out
shes almost passed out drunk
both of her eyes are closed and she immediately tries to sleep on the ground
ronnie helps her up but when he does brandi gives him a kiss a sloppy one
brandi i had a wonderful time tonight
im so fucking shit faced
they kiss again but when they do brandi pukes all over the place
its a disgusting puke and theres vomit on her cheek and stuff
ronnie holds her head for her
are you okay
my breath smells like asshole
ronnie looks longingly into her eyes
i love you brandi
i think ive got puke in my teeth
i dont care
ronnie kisses brandi passionately on the mouth
he walks her inside the house
on the way in she falls over
ronnie helps her up
he carries her into the house where the make love spot is
ronnie is with dennis in the food court
ronnie is smiling but dennis isnt saying a word as usual
dont look at me like that dennis
i told you i wouldnt talk
ronnie sits back but he cant help a giant grin on his face
im serious dennis
a gentleman never kisses and tells
so just stop with all the pressure because its just not gonna happen
ronnie keeps on grinning at dennis
okay fine you son of a bitch you want details ill give you details
i had sex with brandi last night
dennis and ronnie high five
it was amazing
i mean ive never experienced anything like it
ive been with a girl or two
dennis stares at ronnie
okay fine ive been with a girl but let me tell you this was so much better
you know how many times we did it
nell who looks like shes been crying nonstop stuffs a whole cinnabon into her face
as it fills her cheeks she looks over to ronnies table and sees ronnie making thrusting motions at the table
nell swallows stuffs another cinnabon in then storms out of the food court
ronnie continues to talk to dennis
but i got to tell you dennis
it was steamy and sexy but more than anything i should tell you that its her soul that i fell for the most
she got pretty tanked but i could just really tell that shes a good person
the kind of person that i could see myself with
look im gonna get out of here
theres a lot of people i need to tell about this so ill catch up with you later
oh and i almost forgot keep your eyes peeled for crime and stuff
ronnie leaves the table
nell watches brandi as she pops a couple of aspirin behind the makeup counter
she takes a deep breath and walks up to the counter
how may i help you
i need to talk to you
what is it honey
let me guess
youre looking for something to take care of those blackheads and hide that puffiness under your eyes
ive got just the thing
no thats not it
well how much is it
fifty dollars for the bottle
okay ill take it
brandi begins to ring up the cream
listen i know youre ronnies new girlfriend
what the hell are you talking about
i know he left me to be with you and i accept that
i dont know who youve been talking to but its safe to say that youre fucking trippin
its fine really
its going to take a while for me to get over it but ill be okay
nell starts to get all teary eyed
she picks up a kleenex from a box on the counter and wipes her eyes
oh fuckin lord
this is disgusting
pull it together
this is how you run around all the time
have some self respect
no wonder your man left you
who the hell would want to be around this shit all day
nell pulls herself together
jesus teaches us to forgive
and i forgive you for what you did to me when you stole my boyfriend
plus i feel pretty confident that youll end up burning in hell because of the various evil ways you live your life and that brings me some satisfaction
but i just want to tell you that ronnie is a good person
he does a lot of stupid stuff but really he wants to do good for the world
i want you to know that if you hurt him and ruin his heart i will personally come down here and kick the ever living shit out of you
nell walks away
you better fuckin run bitch
nell turns around and starts storming toward brandi
brandi throws her hands up frightened
im just kidding
nell stops charging and walks away
nell walks past bruce who is helping a customer at the end of the counter
its not too late to change your ways
nell walks out of the department store
ronnie looks at the colorful flowers in the glass refrigerator
the flower salesman walks up to ronnie
ronnie ive been expecting you
oh yeah i heard about last night
brandi is quite the woman
congratulations my friend
or should i say welcome to the club
the flower salesman winks and starts laughing
it gets weird so the flower salesman stops
what color of roses do the women like anyway
well it depends on what you are trying to say
the white roses symbolize innocence and purity
yeah were way past the color white if you know what i mean
what about the yellow ones
joy happiness appreciation
i dont even know what to make of that
the pink rose means thank you
the red rose is the most powerful
it symbolizes love
why didnt you just say that
im a busy man here
give me a big bag of the red ones
um can i ask a question
do you really like brandi
ive only been on one date with her but i could see myself being with her for all of eternity
well in that case the greatest symbol of love is just a single red rose
seems like a big bag of roses would be more love than just one but i guess youre the expert
the flower salesman takes a single red rose from the case and hands it to ronnie
brandi is behind the counter gossiping with bruce
ronnie holds his rose and watches them from a distance
he takes a deep breath and then walks to the counter
what are you doing here
i came here to see you
and to present you with this single red rose
it symbolizes love
ronnie thats really
well after last night i just wanted you to know that it wasnt just some fling to me
it meant something special and i felt it deep in my soul
you fucked the security guard
you are such a little slut
oh like youve never been drunk bruce
brandi grabs ronnie and pulls him off to the side
i got to be honest with you
i barely remember last night
i remember it for the both of us
okay see heres the thing
i dont know how to say this so im just gonna come on out with it
ronnie i could never date you seriously
i mean youre a security guard
im the head of mall security
the point is i dont really see myself being with that
you know what i mean
brandi i know exactly what you mean
and i just want to thank you for being honest
youre telling me im not living up to my full potential in life
its funny because ive been feeling like this for quite some time
i guess i just needed that extra little push to get me over this hurdle ive been stuck on
how can you be with a man who isnt living the life he was meant to
yeah something like that
and just you know youre a security guard at the mall and its like come on you know
i dont like it brandi but i do understand
i promise you this
next time you see me i will be wearing a uniform that will make you proud
i will be the man that you will be honored to call your lifes love
dont bet on it
i will though
ill bet everything i have on you
now i ask you for one favor
although i am unworthy will you accept this rose from me anyway
i cant do that
and tell your girlfriend to stop coming by my work and threatening me and shit
brandi walks away leaving ronnie there holding his flower
ronnie sits at a small table and waits patiently
then a policeman walks into the room
ronnie stands to shake his hand
im here to become a police officer
were always on the hunt for new recruits
do you have at least a high school diploma
i have a ged
we usually prefer an actual diploma but ged is technically acceptable
are you a citizen of the united states
you bet your ass i am
barnhardt there are several steps you have to complete in order to be eligible for the police academy
physical evaluation psychological test background check
if you pass these tests you will be admitted to the police academy
now i like to tell all new recruits that they should complete a ride along before making this decision
its where you actually ride along with a real police officer during a routine patrol
it helps give you an idea of the kind of situations youll be dealing with
that sounds fun
sign me up
ronnie sits in the unmarked police car with detective harrison
its like it was meant to be
you behind the wheel
me riding shotgun
two brothers of the badge unite to form the ultimate crime stopping combo
im psyched to be here harrison
thank you for the opportunity
you requested to ride along with me
you want to know the truth
its because i respect you
see when were at the mall its obviously my turf
sure i break your balls about being a rookie but out here in the streets im the rookie
im here to learn
why do you want to become a cop
ive wanted to be a police officer all my life
dont get me wrong i love keeping the mall safe but you guys are the ones that really enforce justice and protect not just our mall but our whole community
i dont tell the guys on my squad this but the security guard job was just temporary
well just pay attention tonight and make sure you stay out of the way
right were not back at the station anymore so we can cut the charade
what are you talking about
well i know that policy demands i stay out of the way but between you and me i just want you to know that if anything pops off tonight im
going to jump right in there and take em down with you
ronnie policy says you have to stay in the car
i get you
you have to say this in order to keep you safe legally speaking
i should probably follow along too
i swear i wont get out of the car and fight justice tonight
ronnie you really cant
ronnie winks at detective harrison
a smile comes across harrisons face
im glad we understand each other
detective harrison puts the car in drive and the guys head off for the night
ronnie and detective harrison sit in the parked car
theyre at the shittiest crack corner in the whole town
lots of scary bums and hookers loiter around the car
yeah so then i basically saw his ass trying to circumvent around the ped exit and slip through the employ exit
the two ped exits are to be used only you see that corner there ronnie
yeah i see it
that corner used to be the worst corner in this whole town
it was riddled with drugs prostitution and gang violence
it was nicknamed the crossroads
shit ive heard of that
thats right but myself and the other officers worked on cleaning it up for years so that the good folks of this neighborhood wouldnt have to worry about being safe
yes sir that corner is a testament to the fine police work of our force
i dont know
it looks pretty shitty to me
well its a low income area ronnie
youre being kind of prejudiced
oh yeah i can see that its basically a fine neighborhood
thats right but it hasnt been easy
we still patrol this area every night just to keep our presence up
i use that same technique at the mall
i usually do the foot patrols myself but because i like you im going to let you do it tonight
but i told you about department policy so im going to need you to keep quiet about this one
you can count on me
thank you for the honor
of course ronnie
i just really believe in you
i wont let you down
ronnie opens the door and gets out of the car
as he exits a car drives by blaring rap music
the passenger throws a beer bottle at ronnie
he dodges it and the bottle shatters on the ground
ronnie is shaken but he waves to detective harrison like hes okay
detective harrison waves back then peels out of there
ronnie is confused
where are you going
detective harrison keeps on driving without looking back
ronnie looks petrified as he stands guard
a bum stands off to the side staring ronnie down
ronnie waves to the bum
the bum runs his finger under his throat
ronnie tries to ignore him
a group of kids walk by ronnie talking loudly
hey no horse play
you guys get on home
you want some crack
no i dont want any crack
in fact i didnt want to do this but you leave me no choice in the matter
im placing you under citizens arrest
ronnie grabs the little kid by the shoulders to restrain him
let me go motherfucker
i place you under citizens arrest for the crime of selling a schedule narcotic
you have the right to remain silent
unbeknownst to ronnie gang members start walking up behind him
its like that scene in training day where all the gangsters are hanging out right across the street with guns and shit
they come up behind him as he speaks to the kids
if you cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed to you
now i guess we just wait here for my ride to come back
ronnie turns around to look for harrisons return but instead he sees that he is surrounded by a large group of pissed off gang members
thats my little brother you got there
who this little guy right here
well i hate to be the one to tell you this but it appears that your little brother has tried to sell me illegal drugs
i know its hard for you to hear that
he works for me motherfucker
is that so
well then it looks like you got one less employee because im taking little brother down
ill die right here before i let crime prevail
the gang members all pull out their guns and point them at ronnie
to the little kid free to go little brother
my mistake completely
good luck with the crack
the little kid runs off
alright so i guess ill be seeing you folks
the gang members stand in ronnies way and cock their guns
yo waste this pig tone
thats really not necessary tone
do it man
gang member puts the gun right up to ronnies head
oh jesus i dont want to die
dont let me die dont do it
ronnie goes down on his knees
ronnie reaches into his boot and pulls out a small rod
he flips his wrist and it extends into a night stick
ronnies begging was a trap
ronnie pops up and begins dropping all those motherfuckers with lightning fast precision
ronnie breaks arms and busts heads like a fucking ninja
gang member comes in and hits ronnie with a sucker punch busting his nose wide open
ronnie stands up and goes mano y mano in a fist fight with gang member
he starts kicking ronnies ass
ronnie goes down again and gang member starts stomping ronnie
ronnie grabs gang member s leg and twists it
he takes him down
ronnie jumps on top of him and begins beating him senseless
slow motion ronnie stands up and looks around at the pool of beaten bodies
this is ronnie at his most primal and also at his best
detective harrison is eating doughnuts and laughing with a bunch of other cops
i cant believe you dropped him off at the crossroads
thats fucking hilarious
trust me you would have done the same thing
this guy is without a doubt the biggest fucking idiot i have ever met
hes probably going to get killed
fuck him i hope he does get killed
all of a sudden ronnie comes in all beaten and bruised
ronnie what are you doing here
i know what you did
ronnie look i didnt do anything youre not going to talk your way out of this one
you set me up
ronnie look dont try to deny it
you set me up and thats all there is to it
ronnie i and i just want to thank you for it
because im proud to report that i passed the test
i know you wanted to see if i had the chops to cut it on the police force and im glad to say that i passed
i knew i would get initiated some time but i didnt think it would be so soon
thank you detective harrison
thank you for believing in me
ronnie i dont know what to say
you dont have to say anything
your actions speak for themselves
thank you for giving this rookie a shot
get used to seeing ronnie barnhardt around here boys
sprint the testing officer blows a whistle and starts the meter dash
ronnie jumps off the starting line and hauls ass down the track
the other trainees fall behind ronnie as he smokes their asses
pull ups ronnie jumps on the bar and begins to do pull up after pull up
side slide the testing officer blows a whistle and ronnie begins to shuffle side to side like an ice skater that never moves forward
sit ups ronnie goes hard on the sit ups
obstacle course ronnie sprints up a wall and flips to the other side
he charges a body of water then jumps onto the rope and swings safely to the other side
all the lights are off and we see the dark shadow creep through the darkness
the shadow breaks into the shoe store and grabs as many pairs of sneakers that it can carry
the shadow opens the sliding cage and closes it from the other side
then bends down and locks it
mark sits behind his desk reading a paper
the headline reads chaos climbs at carolina mall
theres a knock at the door
ronnie sticks his head in the door
good morning mark
is it ronnie
i mean the mall is getting butchered in the press
somebody who works here is ripping the place off
the cops dont have any leads
im getting shit from the owner of the mall
sales are down
i mean whats so good about this morning
i feel your pain mark
quite frankly theres two things happening
one im lacking a sufficient firearm
and two were understaffed
thats why i come to you this morning with a plan
calling to the door come on in charles
charles opens the door and walks in
who is this
this is charles sir
hows it going
you work at ocharleys right
mark i would like to hire charles here as an additional security guard
he would operate under me
i figure with the additional criminal element we should hire more security in hopes that we would have a better chance of catching these guys
do you have any experience son
um sir i have personally been training young charles for weeks now in preparation for this day
the kid kind of looks up to me
im some what of a big brother to the little guy
charles kind of looks at ronnie like hes crazy
alright its actually not a bad idea
it might make our security more visible so we can give people the illusion that were on top of this
ronnie winks at charles
thank you mark
ronnie one more thing
look if this crime doesnt come to an end pretty soon were gonna have to let someone go
i mean youve always done a great job for me but the truth is someone is going to have to take the fall
youre the one who wanted to be head of mall security and quite frankly i just bought my wife a new cadillac so lets just say it wont be me
with charles on my team i can now devote more time to the robbery and pervert case
i plan on having these wrapped up by the end of the week
mark laughs to himself
whyd you just laugh
have fun ronnie
ronnie looks at charles
did i say something funny
lets go ronnie
ronnie and charles take off
ronnie and charles stand in the middle of the floor and supervise the mall walkers
be careful guys
nice and slow
thats not bad but you need to learn to speak in a more authoritative voice
slow it down
slow it down
youve already received one verbal dont make me issue a second
back to charles see you cant be intimidated
you have to make them respect you
ronnie you know i really want to thank you for the job
youre a man of your word
no problem my young student
so i got something to tell you
keep this between us until its official but i dont think im going to be here for much longer
but you love this job
i do love it but it looks like someone is going to be joining the police force
the real police
theyre calling me up
its basically a done deal
just a little red tape is the only thing keeping me from carrying a gun
i didnt even know you wanted to become a cop
its always been my job
the mall thing is great training but it has its limitations
some stars are just meant to shine brighter than others
to a mall walker a mall walker slows her pace
she turns around and ronnie sees that its nell
what are you doing
nothing just getting in shape
well thats okay i guess
just watch your speed okay
nell waves and walks on
isnt that your girlfriend
she looked good
you think so
she looks a lot better
ronnie shrugs it off
ronnie sits across from a female psychologist
okay ronnie today ill be giving you a psychiatric evaluation to determine if youre competent to enter into the police academy
its really just a formality
dont want any serial killers working for us now do we
no maam we dont
okay ronnie so lets start with your background
where are you from
born and raised right here
okay and ronnie have you ever been convicted of any crimes
my record is totally clean
do you now take any illegal drugs or have you taken any in the past
i believe drugs are the path to self destruction and should be purged from the face of the earth with ruthless vengeance
any prescription medications
yes for my nerves
a man in my line of work has a lot of stress to deal with
if youve seen the bloodshed ive seen youd be on the meds too
i where are you going with this
are you presently or have you ever been affiliated with the communist party
i cant believe youd even ask me that
have you ever been in the military
what branch of the military were you in
the kind of branch that doesnt exist on paper
okay heres a real world scenario
you have a gun finally
that wasnt really the question never mind i think i got that one
do you feel like you would work well on a team
would i be more useful working alone i would say definitely
i see myself more like a rambo kind of guy
a man who rolls solo
taking care of business on his own terms
kind of like a superhero or something
why do you want to become a cop
i want to become a cop to help people
the world is a scary place with lots of evil everywhere
see i have this vision of evil trying to get at the world from every angle and there i stand at the top of it all with my gun just
kind of blowing it away
just me and my weapons cleaning up this whole town
i know i could do some good if i was just given a chance and everybody would be a lot better off
so what do you feel is the greatest danger facing a police officer today
maybe russian gang activity but you know what
i think im gonna have to go with evil on that one too
okay i think were good here
its been a pleasure ronnie
thank you maam
ronnies mom takes a bath and swigs on a bottle
shes drunk and passing out in the tub
ronnie scrubs her back with a sponge
im telling you mom this police thing could be good for both of us
not just the fact that ill be making the streets safer for you but they have health insurance and a pension plan so i dont have to worry about your
medical bills as much
i dont care about that bullshit
all i need is a little nip of this good shit right here and im ready to walk through the pearly gates
mom i know but maybe you should stop drinking so much
youre getting up there and you know what the doctor said about your liver
i dont tell you how to party dont tell me how to live my life
ive taken care of you since you were born
i just worry about you is all
ronnie dont get your hopes up about this police thing
why would you say that
you know why
i just dont want to see you get hurt
its my job to protect you from the bullshit
mom i appreciate it but im going to make it as a police officer
im tired of coming in second all the time
everybody in life gets to go for their goals why should i be any different
just be careful is all
youve got a good heart and i dont want to see it broken
i hear you
and ronnie one more thing
whats that mom
in the tub a bunch of bubbles plop to the surface
drunk laughing thats right
now you got to smell it
the police academy is full of energy as new recruits pour up the steps and into the building eager to start their training
ronnie comes walking up and takes a long look at the building
ronnie smiles to himself and heads up the stairs
ronnie reaches the top where detective harrison is waiting
ronnie barnhardt reporting for duty
i can see that
listen i dont really know how to say this but were not going to be able to let you join the academy
it seems you had a little trouble passing the minimum requirements
did i fail one of the tests
well yes actually you failed the psychological exam
reads from the form that ronnie barnhardt shows warning signs of delusion and allowing him to join the force puts his life and the lives of others in jeopardy
detective harrison youve got to believe me
im completely sound
this has got to be a mistake
ronnie i personally did your background check and this is the fifth time youve been turned down for the police academy
you guys keep records on that
we sure do
look i tried to talk to them but theres no way theyre gonna let you in
im sorry but your dreams of becoming a police officer just arent going to happen
thanks for believing in me detective
and just for the record im not crazy
take care ronnie
detective harrison goes inside and closes the doors on ronnie
ronnie stands outside of the closed academy by himself
the camera pushes into ronnie and spins upside down
ronnie is behind the locked gate to the food court but it looks like he is behind bars in a prison
ronnie slides the bars up and walks out
ronnie walks through the mall and looks at the lights of the different shops
everything looks colorful and weird
ronnie is in his own head
this isnt the exciting world as before now its a disgusting fabricated make believe land
the mall is kind of winding down for the day
the stores are closing and people are going home
ronnie sees nell putting her apron away and preparing to leave
ronnie walks up to her
hows it going
can i talk to you for a second
what is it
i tried to get into the police academy again and the same thing happened
oh ronnie im sorry
ronnie starts to tear up
why does this keep happening to me nell
i dont know ronnie
maybe its just not meant to be
are you okay
are you going home
i mean do you want to go somewhere and talk or something
ronnie i cant
ive got plans
look at this sorry piece of shit
ronnie looks up to see saddamn walking toward him
what the fuck do you want
i dont want anything from you
to nell how you doing sweetness
saddamn hugs nell from behind and kisses her on the cheek
you look beautiful tonight
what the fuck is going on
you ready to go
we got reservations at
im ready saddamn
nell for the love of god dont go with him
im sorry ronnie
nell and saddamn turn and walk towards the door
on the way out saddamn turns back around to ronnie and smiles
then he begins to air hump nell from behind
dont go nell
remember your purity
remember your purity
nell and saddamn leave the mall
ronnie sits down on one of the benches in the mall
he watches a couple walk by their little kid swinging between their arms
then stevie comes in and takes a seat next to ronnie
what are you doing ronnie
im just taking a break
what do you want stevie
i dont have time to fuck around with you today
i got something
stevie reaches into his pocket
he pulls out a bunch of polaroids of penises
what the fuck is this
dude i found these all over the mall
im guessing that whoever this mall flasher is left these for girls to find
this thing gets grosser and grosser all the time
well thanks for the clue
maybe i can use this to identify the freak
you can skate all you want around here
whats wrong with you ronnie
what do you mean
i dont know
you just seem kind of sad
nah man im fine
i mean im catchin perverts and protecting this mall and just you know really livin the dream
look man you want to get high
no i dont want to get high
the conversation dies down and the two just kind of sit there
and by the way if i see you getting high i will call the police and have your criminal ass arrested
dont you fuckin ever mistake my kindness for weakness
i hate drugs and i hate you too
fine you fucking dick
steve stands up to leave
ronnie sits there looking sad
ronnie sits in his golf cart staring at the mall as the last of the customers leave
thats when ronnie sees brandi come out of the door
brandi looks around and darts across the parking lot
ronnie follows brandis path and tries to catch up with her
ronnie drives around but he cant find brandi anywhere
ronnie sees a lone black car at the outer edge of the parking lot
he pulls his golf cart over and climbs out
ronnie creeps up to the car and peers in the window
inside ronnie sees brandi and detective harrison banging like a couple of wild animals
ronnie jumps back in shock
brandi stops humping detective harrison
what is it
i thought i heard something
detective harrison looks out of the window
he doesnt see anything
he climbs back on top of brandi
ronnie runs around detective harrisons car wielding a flashlight like a mad man
ronnie beats the shit out of harrisons car
he smashes headlights mirrors and fenders
harrison and brandi duck down
that motherfucker is crazy
well youre the fucking cop
okay here it goes
harrison reaches over brandi and opens her door
what the fuck are you doing
harrison pushes brandi out of the car and shuts himself back in
ronnie sees brandi and stops pummeling the car
ronnie its me
dont do anything crazy
get back inside brandi
this isnt about you
fuck off ronnie
how can you just stand there after you ruined my life and act like nothing happened
its easy cause i dont give a ronnie snaps
he charges at brandi with the flashlight over his head
hes about to crack her when
ronnie stops to see harrison on the other side of him with his pistol drawn and pointed at ronnie
drop the flashlight ronnie
ronnie drops the flashlight from his hands
youre pretty tough with that gun
ronnie i know youve had a hard time you were supposed to be my friend
so youre gonna kill brandi
i was just trying to scare her
you dont scare me you piece of shit
ronnie lifts the flashlight up again like hes going to hit brandi
detective harrison cocks the gun
fine fuck you
fuck all of you
and harrison you better be glad you have a gun or id kick your ass too
and you know what
im taking my friendship back because you dont deserve it
and brandi im taking my love back too
im gonna leave now and you two can just have fun
have fun sleeping tonight because something tells me you wont be able to
ronnie climbs into the golf cart and drives off
that guy is a nut job
tell me about it
so you slept with him
i was drunk okay
you gonna make a big deal out of it
no i guess not
on the television theres an update on the carolina mall flasher
it says he has exposed himself to more girls
as the tv blares the headline ronnie lays in his bed and watches
the images shine color on him but ronnie is in his own world
ronnie has the special elite task force assembled
im disbanding the task force
hey ronnie thats crazy talk
are you cool
no im not cool charles
in fact shit is seriously fucked up
ive got to protect the whole mall by myself
now i got you this fucking job when are you going to stop being a little baby and do something for a change
i dont want to do anything hard
i just want to be a little bitch and brag about dropping out of college
grow a fucking pair will you chucky
im gonna go check the parking lot
charles walks away
calling out im sorry charles
i didnt mean it buddy
ronnie puts his head on the table
you know dennis for the longest time i made this job my whole life
i looked at this mall as a kingdom and i looked at mark as the king
i thought of myself as the first knight and the customers well they were the peasants
i lived by an old code where one was bound by duty and honor
but now i dont know if i believe in that code anymore
ive lost my way
now i just feel like its one big kingdom of shit
right now i got half a mind just to let this whole place burn
burn it to the fucking ground
dennis stares down at the desk
dennis takes off his hat and reveals that he has bleached white eminem hair underneath
next he reaches under his collar and flips out a thin gold necklace
he kicks up his shoes and reveals the newest and freshest basketball kicks
this is the real dennis and for the first time ever he speaks
high ghetto voice ive been waiting on you to get on my page this whole time
you look at this mall as a kingdom
i look at this place like a motherfucking jail sentence
you put on that uniform every morning but what are you really protecting
commerce and corporations and money
well i say fuck that
im a fucking outlaw and im going to live that until the day i die
now i can show you the way but youve got to be willing to accept it
so im gonna ask you now ronnie
are you ready for a trip to the other side
youre goddamn right im ready
dennis and ronnie hang in the back of the mall by the dumpsters
dennis sucks down a fat joint
he passes it to ronnie
so yeah usually i take a joint straight to the head before i start work in this motherfucker but on really stressful days i like to get drunk too
dennis pulls out a flask and gulps it down
ronnie is still staring at the joint
finally he takes a puff and begins violently coughing
he finally stops
fuck it give me the bottle
dennis hands ronnie the bottle and he takes a big swig
ronnie and dennis stand against a wall while they check out booties of various shapes and sizes on all of the girls that walk by
so then i usually come in here and perv out on girls for about an hour or two
i hooked up twice last week
one was this asian chick and the other was this mom
she wasnt that hot but what else do i got to do
two high school girls walk by
sweet jesus in the morning
ronnie and dennis are hanging in a dressing room
dressing rooms are a great place to hide out because nobody is really going to think of looking for me here
you can nap or just kind of hang out and just really have some personal time
hey hand me that camera
ronnie picks up a shitty camera and hands it to dennis
dennis stands up on the bench and looks into the other changing room
the two high school girls are changing into other clothes
dennis starts taking pictures of them without them knowing
ronnie is smoking a joint and so is dennis
right before lunch i usually blaze up again real good
dennis and ronnie walk by the skaters
hey whats up motherfuckers
what up big den
you know smokin that good good
dude why are you hanging out with ronnie
fuck you stevie
hey ronnies alright
let me see that stick
stevie slides the skateboard over to dennis
he jumps on it and does a perfectly executed kick flip
the skaters cheer
brandi is at the counter with bruce
she helps a male customer
my wifes gonna love this perfume
i hope so
its my favorite
brandi looks past the customer and sees ronnie just standing there staring daggers at her
ronnie shakes his head in disgust
the male customer turns around and sees ronnie
its a weird little moment
dennis grabs ronnie by the arm
come on brother
ronnie follows dennis off
ronnie stands in the store and looks down at his walkie
over the walkie ronnie we need you down at the candy store
some little brat has been shoveling peanuts in his mouth for the last hour
ronnie turns the walkie talkie off
dennis runs behind the counter
dennis drops the needle on a rockin song
dennis jumps on top of the counter and starts jumping up and down with the music
hes fucking drunk
dennis jumps off the counter and tackles ronnie knocking over a stand of dvds
ronnie and dennis ride on a mini railroad train for kids
they both drink from the flask as they spin around the track
its full of nothing but kids and security
the hot sales clerk stands outside of the dressing room wearing a sexy teddy with a g string and garters
dennis and ronnie are kicking back in the love seat and watching
dennis makes a motion for the sales clerk to spin around
she reluctantly does as she is instructed
ronnie and dennis play video games
a little kid tries to take the controller from dennis but dennis whips out the handcuffs
he locks the little kid onto the display case so the kid cant move
ronnie and dennis play skee ball except ronnie tosses the balls to dennis who is standing on top of the machine
dennis slam dunks the balls into the point hole
the tickets pour out
ronnie and dennis are driving in the golf cart and theyre both wearing those giant sunglasses that they won with arcade tickets
behind them stevie and the other skaters hold onto the golf cart and get pulled on their skateboards
they race towards a loading ramp
dennis floors it and they go up the ramp and jump the golf cart into the air
the golf cart and skaters soar into the air
it holds forever until suddenly the golf cart lands with a thud
the mall is basically empty as dennis and ronnie make the final rounds
they get to the doors and lock up for the night
dennis i got to thank you for today
man i was so down but you taught me that i dont need to take things so seriously here
we have a pointless existence
who gives a fuck
dont mention it homey
im just glad i got me a partner in crime
i like that
you know ive never really had a friend before but i think that this could be the beginning of a real good thing
dennis unlocks the doors to the gap
you aint even seen the best part
after everybody leaves i rob the shit out of this place
what do you mean
i steal shit
youre the one whos been robbing the mall
whod you think it was
dennis goes inside the gap and just starts grabbing shit
i cant believe this
right in front of my goddamn face this whole time
dennis holds up a sweat shirt
this probably will look good with my complexion
dennis i cant take part in this
ronnie i thought you were down
what the fuck
here i am opening up myself to you and youre just gonna stick it to me like this
what the fuck has this place ever done for you
dont you know that people see us as jokes
a useless tool thats left in the shed
well thats not me
not now not ever
i told you im an outlaw
i cant let you rob the mall
what the fuck you mean you cant let me
come on dennis
were best friends so just put that stuff back and lets go get a beer
alright ronnie youre right
dennis sets the shirts down
i dont really know what i was thinking
robbing the mall
lets just go get that beer
that makes me feel better
ronnie turns to walk but dennis grabs the hand of one of the mannequins and rips it off
he takes the hand and cracks ronnie over the head with it
ronnie goes down on his knees
see ya in mexico bitch
dennis cocks back and whacks ronnie again
ronnies lights go out
dennis pulls out of the mall driving a harley davidson
he flips a joint into the air and peels out
he cruises down the street
he passes a cop car and flips it off
the janitor walks up the floor with a mop
ronnie is battered and bloodied from his fight with dennis but he is wide awake and handcuffed to the gap
ramon get your ass over here
go get my spare keys out of the office
the janitor looks at ronnie smiles and calmly mops in the other direction
goddamn it get back here
go get my goddamn keys
mark sits across the desk from ronnie and charles
how fucking stupid do you have to be
i mean dennis
what the fuck ronnie
how could you not have known it was dennis
then how the fuck could you be so stupid as to let him get away
observe and report
those are the only two things you have to do and you cant do those worth a shit
can i speak now
are you sure
just start talking ronnie
it seems only natural that some people would want to blame me and truth be told i do put a lot of that blame on myself
but some people might say that the cops are to blame for not catching them
some people might say that the reason this happened was the undeniable fact that i was under equipped and quite frankly lacking a sufficient firearm
but not me
i carry this loss alone deep inside my heart
because youre fired
im serious ronnie
ive always liked you but theres just no excuse for this
somebody is going down and ill be damned if its going to be me
now dont make a big thing out of this
just pack your shit and get out by the end of the day
wait a minute
i thought i could trust you mark and now youre telling me that youre going to be the one to put the knife in my back
fair weather friend you are
im not your friend im your boss
you think youre so smart mark
you dont know everything
if youre firing me then you can say goodbye to your entire security staff
because there is no fucking way my team is going to work here if you fire me
isnt that right charles
ronnie i got to talk to you about this
mark asked me down here to escort you out
and you told him to fuck off right
what the fuck do you want from me ronnie
this isnt happening
everybody is fucking me over
i hate you all
charles stands up
im sorry ronnie but its time to go
wait a minute
ill work for free mark
ill pay you
i love you
ronnie jesus have a little self respect
you dont love me mark
ronnie its over
ronnie takes a deep breath
he stands up to leave
ronnie starts to walk out but stops
mark asked you down here in case i got out of hand
well get ready to earn your money
he grabs a calendar and throws it on the ground in a violent baby like outburst
charles tries to grab ronnie but ronnie pushes him off
ronnie knocks the framed pictures off of the wall
he then opens the door and slams it into the wall over and over again
that does nothing
ronnie tries to rip the cushion on the chair
he looks ridiculous
alright ronnie thats enough
ronnie stops and begins to cry
then he runs out of the office in tears
ronnie lies in his bed and we
time lapse the sun rises and sets three times through the window of his bedroom signifying that three days have passed
the whole time ronnie doesnt move from his bed
ronnie gets on his nice clothes but theyre a far cry from his security guard uniform
ronnies mom comes up to him
whats on the agenda for today
i guess maybe look for a job or something
well i know youre sad about it but try to look on the bright side
there is no bright side
my life is over
ronnie you may not be smart or handsome but youve got dreams inside of you and dreams make you special
no matter what this world tries to throw at you they can never take those dreams away
what the fuck are you talking about mom
i dont know
i just know that mothers are supposed to talk like that to their children when theyre sad so i tried
what do you want from me
thats exactly what youre supposed to do
i just blew my life
i tried to be a big shot a hero and a stupid cop
i wanted to be recognized for being great
i should have just been happy where i was at
i didnt do my duty
ronnie the other night when i soiled my pants right before i puked myself i was thinking about how you would come home and find me and clean me up
i knew you would be there to find me and take care of me so i was able to pass out on the floor and not worry
if theres one thing you know about its duty
i do it because i love you
i know and i love you too ronnie
i havent always been easy to deal with and most people would have thrown me away a long time ago
just like your father did
but not you ronnie
look whiskey was always the way i dealt with being a single mother but as i get older i know that i cant keep doing this
ive got everything i need with you
so i want you to know that im ready to make a change
your life needs to get easier and you dont need to take care of old mom anymore
are you going to quit drinking
im switching to beer
i can pound those all day and still keep my shit together
im doing it for you
im so proud of you mom
im proud of you
now today is a new day and were going to get through it
now get out there and find what the world has in store for you
ronnies mom leaves and ronnie looks at himself in the mirror
then something catches his eye
ronnie sees a newspaper laying on the ground
he picks it up and reads
ronnie walks up the steps that lead to the local jail
ronnie walks into one of those booths where you can talk to a prisoner on the opposite side of a plexiglas divider
ronnie sits down in wait
then two guards appear escorting a handcuffed dennis
dennis takes a seat and picks up the phone
whats up ronnie
how you doing
ive been better
im holding it down in here
yeah i heard they finally caught up with you
i should have hit mexico but you know i got stoned and just kind of kicked with this girl in kannapolis for a while
you know they fired me when they found out you were the one who robbed the mall
sorry about that
its cool but i need to know why you did it
i told you
im an outlaw
come on dennis
man you want to know the real reason
alright ill tell you
man that gig was one of the best jobs i ever had
i got to wear a uniform i could smoke weed whenever i wanted
for once in my life i felt like i was actually somebody
i know most people dont think its shit but i really loved it
then all of a sudden i find out that your ass got promoted over me
after all i put into it youre the one that makes it to head of mall security
you know what its like to get passed over ronnie
so i got pissed off
i started robbing the joint as a way to get at them for what they did to me
but you know what ronnie
you ever love a girl so much that you cant break up with her so the only thing you can do when she pisses you off is smack her in
the goddamn face
no dennis i havent
well i have
and thats pretty much how i felt about the job
thanks for talking to me dennis
well its the least i could do after knocking you out and all
ronnie starts to hang up the phone
bail me out of here old friend
i cant do it dennis
youre now a criminal who stopped caring but my crime is that i care too much
ronnie hangs up the phone and walks out
ronnie comes into the mall and makes his way down the center of it feeling naked without his uniform
charles now wearing a mall security uniform comes out and stops ronnie
ronnie what are you doing back here
i just came to talk to nell
dont get your panties in a wad im just here as any normal patron
ronnie dude ive been all fucked up in the head
i feel like shit about what happened
i mean here i am just looking to shuck responsibility and i ended up hurting you in the process
look i should have been honest with you
i dont give two shits about this stupid job
but you do
its okay charles
ive decided im going back to college
getting stoned and studying beats this any day
i realize that now
i realize that there arent any jobs where you can avoid hard choices
anyway take as long as you want at the mall
ill keep mark off your back
ronnie sees nell sitting down and eating a cinnabon
ronnie takes a seat at her table
ronnie what are you doing here
i got something i want to say
i dont think we should be talking
ill be quick
nell this is the only job i was ever any good at
im not a crime solver or right hand of the law
im just a dumb guy in a uniform who cant even become a real policeman
somewhere along the way i started to think i was something special someone whose shit didnt stink someone who deserved to date out of my league
you know ive learned
my shit does stink
it smells horrible
and youre also out of my league but for some reason you like the smell of my shit
i guess what im saying is
ronnie reaches into his pocket and pulls out his mothers disgusting yellow engagement ring but for some reason it looks beautiful
if you give me another chance ill spend the rest of my life making it up to you
and you can call me sweetie in front of people and ill like it
nell thinks about it
she leans over the table and kisses ronnie
ronnie is stunned
with one kiss nell seems to make everything okay
they stare at each other and the moment seems to hold for an eternity
love is in the air until
the pervert runs
ronnie gets pissed
son of a bitch
oh my god
are you alright
shit we should call somebody
go get him
ronnie realizes that this is his duty and his alone
ronnie rises from the table slowly
he looks at nell and nods acceptance
then ronnie runs after the pervert
the pervert is in a full blown run through the mall
his trench coat is wide open and his wienie is flapping for the world to see
in a way its his greatest accomplishment
mothers grab their daughters
no one is safe
ronnie comes ripping out of the food court
hes got a fierce look of determination in his eyes
he runs hard to catch up with the perv
theres a crowd surrounding the cell phone kiosk
the pervert bursts through the crowd and knocks people out of the way
what the fuck man
ronnie comes running up behind him
get out of the way
get out of the way
the crowd totally clears a path for ronnie but ronnie stops running and sucker punches saddamn
saddamn goes down hard and ronnie rejoins the chase
stay the fuck away from my wife
runs past the skaters who are hanging out on a bench
dude thats fucking disgusting
ronnie comes running way far behind
hey ronnie here
stevie slides his skateboard out for ronnie to jump on
ronnie jumps like he is going to land on the skateboard and sail to the finish line
however when ronnies feet touch the board it goes shooting out from under him
ronnie slams onto the ground
all of the skaters start laughing
what a fucking douche
ronnie picks himself up and starts to run again
he only makes it a little ways before he hits something slippery
ronnie falls onto the ground and cracks his head
ronnie lays on the ground and sees ramon laughing against a wall with a mop in his hands
okay ramon were fucking even
ronnie picks himself up and starts running again
runs past victorias secret
he stops at the doorway and as if he cant resist flashes the ladies in the store
he takes off running again
as he runs by the record store which of course is blasting music
ronnie stops at the doorway
turn it down
turn it down
the record store guy turns the music down
ronnie goes back to his chase
runs past mark
he looks around at all the people staring
okay shows over
enjoy your shopping experience at carolina mall
ronnie runs past mark
calling out charles
charles comes running up
what is it
call the police
and go get ronnie
hes trying to help
just do what i ask you
charles runs after them
ronnie sees charles coming and runs faster
charles is moving in on him
ronnie turns around to see charles as he flings him a giant flashlight
ronnie catches it
ronnie starts running again but this time hes a little more together
has made his way through the whole mall at this point but ronnie is right on his ass
the pervert is heading toward the department store
the pervert comes barreling in and the ladies at the perfume and make up counters scream
he looks like hes charging straight at brandi
hes getting closer
ronnie comes in from the side and nails the pervert with the flashlight
ronnie jumps on top of the perv and beats the ever living shit out of him
this is a vision of a man leaving all out on the field
ronnie stops pounding and looks up
he sees brandi staring at him
ronnie is overcome by anger and beats on the pervert harder than ever before
finally charles comes in and pulls ronnie off of him
a huge crowd has gathered around
ronnie has blood all over him
ronnie picks the pervert up and holds him tightly by the arms
mark comes running up
you want to report this to the police
im taking him down myself
ronnie starts to walk away with the pervert
ronnie stops and turns around
mark tosses ronnie a set of keys
good job ronnie
thank you sir
ronnie leads the pervert outside
on the way he passes brandi
good job ronnie
i dont love you
i dont love you either
the customers and employees of the mall clap for ronnie
this is his finest moment
ronnie is stuck in traffic
he looks ridiculous in the orange golf cart on a city street with a pervert chained up beside him but ronnie could care less
the golf cart pulls up to the police station and ronnie gets out with the perv
ronnie walks up the front steps and all of the officers part and let him through
detective harrison is at the top of the stairs
ronnie walks right up to him
i caught the pervert
i see that
well you better turn him over to me and ill take him inside and book him
since youre a real cop right
hey ronnie you may not be an officer of the law but youre the laws right hand
ronnie lets go of the pervert
he nods to harrison then turns his back and walks back down the steps
ronnie gets into his golf cart and drives away
ronnie stands in front of the mall with nell beside him
ronnie looks nervous but nell looks down at her yellow ring with pride
she looks at ronnie sees a loose eyelash and brushes it off of him
what are you doing
you had an eyelash
im trying to remember my speech
nell looks straight ahead but smiles as ronnie tries to take himself serious
okay ronnie were ready for you
ronnie takes a deep breath and walks over to where the local news has set up a camera and microphone
okay we rolling
were here today with ronnie barnhardt head of mall security here at carolina mall
last week ronnie was able to catch the carolina mall flasher single handed and bring him to justice
ronnie how did you manage to find the identity of the pervert and take him down
well being a mall security guard basically requires the same skill set that someone in say the fbi has
you have to use logic and evidence and old fashioned common sense as well as the latest technology to deduce the criminal mind
its what i do
all of a sudden stevie and the skaters come up behind ronnie
they look into the camera lens and start smiling
ronnie turns around and sees them but tries to focus on the reporter
any last words for the folks at home
yeah id just like to say that carolina mall is back on track and safer than ever
the skaters start flipping off the camera
ronnie keeps getting distracted
in fact there are some wonderful sales taking place right now
stevie walks up behind ronnie and pretends to hump him
so for all you families out there come on down and see us
its a wonderful place
ronnie turns around angrily
the skaters jump on their skateboards and skate off
ronnie runs after them
he jumps into his golf cart and gives chase
the news camera is still rolling
the female reporter looks into the lens
you heard it folks
everything is back to normal here at carolina mall
back to you lindsay
