sling blade by by billy bob thornton b
b if window
href b b a few patients sit around fumbling with themselves
one man sits at a table scratching back and forth on a piece of paper with a crayon
another stands in a corner smoking a cigarette and staring at the crayon guy
this is charles
another man karl sits in a chair staring at the floor and rubbing his hands together
we cut back and forth between charles staring and crayon man scratching
after a moment an attendant approaches charles
you cant smoke in here
charles stares at him blankly for a moment and continues smoking
he looks back to crayon man again for a moment then looks over at karl and then goes and sits down beside him
a mercury is a good car and thats what i was driving that day
ive owned a lot of cars
lots of different kinds of cars
she was standing this girl on the side of the street where there was a chicken stand not the colonel mind you but nevertheless a chicken stand and i pulled
the mercury over and rolled down the window by electric power
she was wearing a leather skirt and she had a lot of hair on her arms
i like that
i like it a lot
it means a big bush
i like a big bush
she said are you dating
i said yes and she got in the car
we pulled to a remote location one that she and i both felt comfortable with and she said how much can you spend
i said what it takes to see your bush
i know its a big one
she said twenty five dollars which to a working man is not chicken feed
i produced the money and she put it in her shoe and pulled up her skirt
there before me lay a thin crooked uncircumcised penis
you can imagine how badly i wanted my twenty five dollars back
two young women marsha dwiggins carrying a briefcase and theresa evans carrying two camera bags are being led down the hallway by a guard
i dont know why youre so weirded out this is not san quentin its just a nuthouse
most of these people dont even know where they are theyre not gonna hurt you
in a few minutes were gonna be in a room with a killer
that doesnt bother you
hey youre the one that wanted to major in journalism
anyhow wasnt the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it it was twenty five years ago he probably doesnt even remember it
wrinkling her nose do you smell shit
they reach a door and the guard ushers them through
jerry woolridge stands up from behind the desk as they enter
hes in his fifiles and looks like a school teacher shop class or perhaps eighth grade science
these are the people from that newspaper deal
oh yeah from the college
woolridge shakes hands with them
my names jerry woolridge
nice to meet you
im marsha dwiggins and this is theresa evans
shes here to take the pictures
yall have a seat
is this all of you
i think there must have been a little mix up
i told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is there couldnt be any pictures
its sposed to be just a little story or article or something isnt that right
well yeah its for the school newspaper
but it has pictures
i mean its a regular paper you know
karls real sensitive about having his picture made
he wouldnt even be on the bulletin board for the easter collage
to guard melvin would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes
you girls want some coffee
no thank you
the other thing is i told your boss on the phone to send a man
karl wont talk to women
close up on karls face
charles has started another monologue
there was a young man named john liggit hunter who was in the filling station business and a good filling station business
he was one of those young men that we run across so often in life
im sure youve run across them that didnt deserve the things he had
one of those things was his beautiful bride sarah
she was a georgia peach
as a matter of fact she looked more like the picture ive had in my head than any woman ive ever seen
i took it upon myself to take her away from john liggit hunter who didnt deserve her
im not sure if i mentioned that he was a frenchman who claimed to be an englishman
it took some very strong nylon cord to take her away from him
she was a fighter as well as a georgia peach
the girls look confused
i dont know what to tell you
i made myself pretty clear i thought
he probably got busy and wasnt thinking
i know how that is
i used to teach shop and eighth grade science
well what do we do
we drove all the way out here
lets just go marsha
no we have to get this story
i thought youd be happy to leave
why wont he talk to women
he has problems
with all that
he wont hardly talk to anybody really
just certain people
hes very troubled
leaning in to karl a shovel just makes too goddamn much racket
takes a drink of coffee i dont think hes talked to a woman in twenty five or so years
that i know of anyway
thats why i said to send a man
at least maybe hed answer a question or two for a man
im all for helping the college out believe me
it might be a real good article or story
cant you talk to him
maybe talk him into it
im a real good interviewer
just get me in the room with him
to guard melvin go get karl and take him down to the old classroom
woolridge and the two women walk down the hallway
ill talk to him and see what we can do
woolridge is opening a door
he enters and the women follow him in
he flips on a light switch and very bright florescent lights illuminate the room
you see karl growing up only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it
he couldnt really read but well neither could his mother
but his father made sure that his mother knew what the bible said
and she made sure karl knew
you know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed right
i knew he slept in a toolshed
his mother told him that he was their punishment
hers and his fathers from god for having sex before they were married
i dont think so
just period i think
she told him
god gave them the ugliest creation he could think of
karl has an entire book a notebook
on every page it says franklin chapter verse number
he wrote that a few years ago after hed learned to write
his fathers name was franklin
thats really strange
what does it mean
one of his daddys bible lessons i imagine
yall pull up a chair
ill go out and talk to him
close up on charless face
you have to make something explode to truly understand it
you have to examine the tiny particles while theyre on fire
off screen we hear footsteps approaching
we pull back and see melvin the guard
karl i gotta take you down to the old classroom
woolridge has some people for you to see down there
melvin and karl walk down the hallway
woolridge stands outside the door of the classroom
they reach him and woolridge talks quietly to karl
karl you know do you remember when i told you about those people from that newspaper
pause they want to ask you some questions about your release
they think it would make an interesting story
will you talk to em
pause now theyre women
i think it might be good for you to
youre gonna be seein all kinds of people when you go on the outside
thisll help you i believe
its just woolridge and the two women in the room
well it surprised the dickens out of me
he said hell talk to you
marsha smiles and looks at theresa
but heres the thing
hell only talk to you
he doesnt want you to ask him anything
and you shouldnt stare at him
how am i going to conduct an interview if i cant ask him any questions
its the best youre gonna get
can i ask you a question
if hes so troubled why are you letting him out
what if he does it again
it happens all the time
his times up
thats the rules
hes been treated and reevaluated
he doesnt show any signs any more
oh were gonna change the light in here for karl
i hope you can see to write
woolridge turns on a lamp on a desk and turns off the overhead lights
he opens the door and melvin brings karl in
in the semidarkness woolridge pushes a chair up and motions for marsha to sit
karl stands beside melvin motionless
woolridge whispers to theresa
youll have to step outside
theresa starts to protest
karl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as melvin ushers theresa outside into the hallway
karl sits staring at the floor
rubbing his palms together and breathing strangely as usual
he sits silent for what seems like forever
theresa stands on one side of the door melvin on the other
can i just sneak in there
i wont take any pictures i promise
i just want to listen
im sorry you cant
theresa takes a cigarette from her purse and starts to light it
you cant smoke in here
marsha is staring at karl
karl still breathing and rubbing his palms starts to speak
his voice is low and raspy but not just low and raspy strange
well i reckon what youre a wanting to know is what im doing in here
i reckon the reason im in here is cause i killed somebody
but i reckon what you was a wanting to know is how come me to kill somebody
well i reckon ill start at the front and tell you
pause heavy breathing i lived most of my life out behind my mother and fathers house in a little old shed and my daddyd built for me
they didnt too much want me up there in the house with the rest of em
i mostly just set around out there in the shed all the time a lookin at the ground
it didnt have no floor but i had me a hole dug out to lay down in and a quilt or tow that i put down there
pause more breathing my daddy was a hard workin man most of his life not that i can say the same fer myself
i most just set around the shed and tinkered around with a lawn mower or two and went to school off and on from time to time but the children
there made quite a bit of sport of me made fun of me quite a bit
some of em roughed me up sometimes so mostly i stayed out back there in the shed
my daddy worked down at the sawmill there down there at the planer mill for an old man named dixon
old man dixon was a very cruel feller he didnt treat his employees very well didnt pay em much of a wage didnt pay my daddy much of a wage
just barely enough to get by on
but i reckon he got by all right they come out one or the other of em usually my mother and fed me pretty regular
at least i know he made enough for me to have mustard and biscuits three or four times a week
old man dixon had a boy named jesse dixon
jesse was really more cruel than his daddy
he made quite a bit of sport of me and takened advantage of the little girls around the neighborhood quite a bit
pause he used to say my mother was a very pretty woman
he said it quite a bit from time to time when i was at the school house
well i reckon you want me to get on and tell you what happened so i reckon ill tell you
i was settin out in the shed one evenin not doin too much just kindly starin at the wall and a waitin fer my mother to come out and give
me my bible lesson and i heared a commotion up in the house there so i got up and run up on the screened in porch there to see what was a goin on and i looked in the kitchen window and i seen my mother a layin there on the floor without any clothes on
pause breathing and seen jesse dixon a layin on top of her having his way with her
pause well i just seen red
i picked up a kaiser blade that was a layin there by the screen door some folks calls it a sling blade i call it a kaiser blade
its just a long handle like a axe handle with a long blade on it thats shaped kind of like a banana
sharp on one edge and dull on the other
its what the highway boys use to cut down weeds and whatnot
i went in the kitchen there and i hit jesse dixon up side the head with it and knocked him off my mother
i reckon that didnt quite satisfy me so i hit him again in the neck with the sharp edge and just plumb near cut his head off
well my mother she jumped up from there and started yellin what did you kill jesse fer
what did you kill jesse fer
pause intense breathing well come to find out my mother didnt really mind what jesse was a doin to her
i reckon that made me madder than what jesse had made me
i takened the kaiser blade some folks calls it a sling blade i call it a kaiser blade and hit my mother up side the head with it an killed
long pause breathing some folks has asked me if i had it to do over again would i do the same thing
i dont know i reckon i would
anyhow they seen fit to put me in here and here ive been for a great long while
ive learned to read some took me four years to read the bible
i reckon i understand a good deal of it
it wasnt what i expected in a lot of places
ive slept in a good bed for a great long while
theyve seen fit to put me out now
they tell me theyre a settin me free today
anyhow i reckon thats all you need to know
if you want any more details i reckon i can tell em to you
i dont know if thats enough for your newspaper or not
suddenly marsha speaks from the darkness
will you ever kill anybody again karl
this seems to startle the very room itself
woolridge motions for marsha to shut up and karl stops still
he breathes hard for a moment then starts to calm down
he seems almost at ease
he slowly looks up
from karls point of view we barely see marshas face in the dim light
karl is looking straight at marsha
slowly i dont reckon i got no reason to kill nobody
woolridge stands just outside the classroom door with marsha and theresa
karl stands down the way a few feet with melvin
is he leaving right this minute
weve got some paperwork to take care of
dont worry you wont run into him in the parking lot
i didnt mean that
i hope the best for you miss dwiggins with your school and your paper and all
where will he go
wherever he wants to
i think hes going back to millsburg where hes from
its just about twenty miles from here
will he be supervised
as much as anybody else is i guess
yall have a good rest of the day now
marsha and theresa walk toward the exit
as they pass karl he speaks to marsha
looking down thank you
immediately extends her hand thank you
karl doesnt take her hand
karl continues to stare at the floor until the women exit
i reckon im gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people
yes i guess you are
i reckon im gonna have to get used to them lookin at me too
you better go get your things
i aint got nothing but them books
you better go get em
all right then
karl walks slowly down the hallway
karl steps off the bus carrying a few books by a strap
he stands there for moment staring at the bus station as the few people around stare at him then he starts walking
karl standing in front of a barbershop looking through the window at a man having his hair cut
in front of the police station
staring at an empty school yard
karl stands and stares at the building for a moment
he sees a woman take a tray of food from the window
when shes gone he walks up to the window
a pimply faced teenage boy comes to wait on him
can i help you
i was kindly wantin somethin or nother deat
well what did you want
you have any biscuits for sale
naw we dont have biscuits
karl stands in silence for a moment
did you decide sir
what you got thats good to eat
well i guess its all good
what do you like to eat here
i like to eat them pretty good
french fried potaters
how much you want fer em
ill get some of them i reckon
sixty for small and seventy five for large
give me the biguns
karl digs in his pocket for money
karl sits on a bench eating french fries
after a moment a twelve or thirteen year old boy comes out of the laundromat wrestling three or four big bags of laundry
he cant seem to get a plan together for carrying them all
karl gets up and goes over to him
the boy looks up at karl a little startled by karls strange figure looming over him
these dang things are heavy
hard to carry too
what you got in there warshing
aint you got no mama and daddy to tend to it
i got a mama but shes at work over at bens dollar store
my daddys dead
pause he got hit by a train
how fer you going with them sacks full of warsh
about a half a mile i think it is
ill help you tote em if i dont give out first
you dont have to though
karl picks up two sacks and they walk away
they walk in silence for a while before the boy finally speaks
my name is frank wheatley
whats your name
karls my name
whats you last name
what are all them books
ones the bible
one of ems a book on christmas
one of ems how to be a carpenter
how come youre carryin them around with you

dont you live somewhere
i did live there in the state hospital
whyd you live there
i killed some folks quite awhile back
they said i wadnt right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin me in jail
they let you out
they told me i was well
they had to turn me loose
are you well
i reckon i feel all right
you dont seem like youd kill nobody
they reach a little white frame house and the boy turns up the sidewalk
this is my house
you can just set those bags on the porch
karl sets the bags down and he and the boy stare at each other in silence for a moment
do you like to play football
i never was much count at it
i never did get picked out fer it
me and the burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time
if you ever want to come by and play
we aint no good either
well ill see you later
he goes inside leaving karl staring at the front door
karl stands at the counter
a middle aged man is selling tickets
how does a feller go about gettin up to the state hospital
you buy a ticket for fourteen dollars and then set and wait for the four fifteen bus to kelton
all right then
karl walks down the hallway carrying his books
a couple staffers give him why are you still here looks
he reaches a door and goes in
there is no one at the desk in the outer office so karl goes into woolridges office
karl finds woolridge doing paper work
woolridge looks up startled
karl what in the world are you doing here
i want to come back and stay here
well you cant do that
youre a free man
youve been let out to do as you please
i reckon i dont care nothin about bein a free man
i dont know how to go about it
well you have to learn
itll take some time
dont you know anybody down there to help you out
your daddys still livin down there from what you told me
pause i guess he wouldnt help you any would he
i wasnt thinking
you dont know anybody
never did know too much of nobody
not to hep me out anyway
sighs listen karl the truth is i dont know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do
if it was up to me id let you stay here if thats what you wanted
im just doin my job
they sit in silence for a moment you follow me
no answer listen i know an old boy that runs a fix it shop deal down in millsburg
he used to go to church with me
youre good workin on small engines and things
if i put my neck out for you with him will you work at it if hell hire you

i just cant let you stay here
its the rules
if something happened well id be liable
i reckon i can just walk around till the mornin
or set and read me a book somewhere
they sit and stare at each other for a moment
woolridge his wife his teenage son bubba and teenage daughter sit in various comfortable chairs looking extremely uncomfortable and staring at karl who is sitting on the edge of a
chair looking at the floor
after a long creepy moment mom speaks
karl would you like a muffin

i understand jerry is going to take you somewhere else tomorrow
i dont reckon i know nobody name jerry
shes talkin about me karl

karl stands in the middle of the room holding his books
woolridge closes the door
woolridge walks into the kitchen where mom and son sit at the table

woolridge already dressed walks through the den and down the hallway
he knocks on the bedroom door

woolridge opens the bedroom door and sees karl sitting on the edge of the bed beside his books
the light is on the bed still as it was the night before
didnt you go to sleep at all karl

well i guess we better hit the road
woolridges car pulls into the parking lot
he and karl get out and walk toward the shop
two men bill cox a large man in his forties and scooter hodges a really country looking guy in his thirties look up from behind the counter as woolridge and
woolridge goes to the counter karl stands by the door looking at the floor

bill slaps woolridge on the shoulders and wheezes with laughter
he wont steal

they say youre a whiz on fixin lawn mowers and things
ive tinkered around on em a little bit
we order from dairy queen at noontime usually

the place is cluttered with mowers edgers weed eaters and other equipment most of it in pieces
a small cot is in a little clearing in the corner by the bathroom

they leave karl standing in the midst of the lawn mowers
he sets the broom down and goes and sits on the cot
after a moment he gets back up and starts sweeping again
its lunch time and bill scooter and karl are sitting in folding chairs behind the counter eating from their dairy queen to go bags
karl has french fries

karl is walking down a residential street
he stops in front of the house where the boy frank lives and stares at the house for a moment then he walks up to the door and stares at
a curtain moves and the boys face appears at the window
he comes and opens the door
i thought i heard somebody on the porch

frank and karl make their way through the fairly crowded store
its sort of a mini version of a walmart
they find franks mother in her red smock talking to a guy in a red bens knit shirt
they are laughing together and pricing some mouthwash
linda wheatley is a short plain woman in her thirties
the man vaughan cunningham is in his forties with a neat flattop hair cut glasses and a paunch hanging over his belt
they eye karl suspiciously as the boys approach
what you up to
let me guess
you want a bunch of candy and a pop
youre gonna rot your teeth that way
but i bet i know what you would like even better
i put potted meat on special four cans for a dollar and theyre not moving very well
id sure let a few cans go for free to the right boy
i dont like potted meat
daddy used to say it was made out of lips and peckers and intestints
frank dont talk that way
whos that strange lookin man behind you
did he follow you in here
can i help you sir
oh thats karl
i met him at the laundrymat
karl this is my mama
and vaughan vaughans the manager
he lets mama off any time she feels like it cause theyre best friends
nice to meet you karl
keeping his distance pleased to know yall
theres an uncomfortable silence
frank come back here with me for a minute
she shuffles him away and leaves vaughan staring at karl
i dont think ive ever seen you before
naw i dont believe you have
i dont reckon i never been in here
this store didnt used to be here
its been here seventeen years
did you live here before or something

pause are you going to be staying here long

not really to speak of
linda and frank return from the back
hey karl guess what
mama said you can stay with us
out in the garage
our car wont fit in there anyway
its real neat
frank told me about your situation
and frank loves company
you know especially after his daddy passed and all
there aint no sense in you stayin in that old greasy shop
to vaughan hushed hes mentally retarded poor thing
hushed he just got out of the state hospital
put out i know
can we get some candy and pops
sure go ahead
they walk off down the aisle leaving vaughan a little puzzled
are you sure its safe to let him around that guy
franks just crazy about him
he likes the way he talks
he helped him carry home the clean laundry
hes been in the state hospital a long time something must be wrong with him
hes retardeds all
you know hes always after a father figure and lord knows doyle aint a good one with his mean ass
what about me
i dont think he sees you as a guy guy
wrinkles his brow karl is a guy guy
karl and frank sit on stumps in a little clearing enjoying the spoils of their bens dollar store visit
this is what i call my secret place cause i come out here when i feel like bein by myself
i used to come here with karen cross
shes kind of like my girlfriend or used to be
she says she likes jerry maroney now
but im gonna get her back cause i love her
we used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight
she didnt want to have anything to do with me in front of other people cause i dont have any money
well mama and me i mean
she seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though
she said she loved me too
settin right on that stump youre on
see her daddys a dentist so theyre rich
sos jerry maroneys daddy
he owns the ice plant
was your folks well off
didnt have too much
enough to scrape by on i reckon
they still around your folks
my mothers dead
my daddys sposed to be around still
he dont want to have nothin to do with me though
how do you know
he never did want to
i figure he aint changed his mind much
how did your mama die
long pause you dont need to know all of that
youre just a boy
you need to think about good thoughts while youre still a boy
theyll be plenty of time for the other
ive had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died
sometimes i wish i was still real little and he was still here
my mamas real good but i wish i had both of em
pause when we went to memphis one time in the car it was rainin so hard we couldnt see the road
but i wadnt scared because i thought as long as daddy was drivin nothin could happen to us
i feel that way about mama now
he looks at the ground for a moment mama has a boyfriend now
his name is doyle hargraves
he works construction so he makes a pretty good livin
he still dont help mama out with any money though
he aint no good
hes mean to her
he dont like me at all
mama says its because hes jealous i belong to my daddy instead of him
he stays with us all night sometimes but hes got his own house
somebody told me its so he can still have other girlfriends
i like it on the nights when he aint at our house
im not so nervous then
how come her to keep bein girlfriends and all with him if hes mean to her
she says its for the times when hes good to her
shes lonely since daddy died
she said sometimes she dont know why
pause he threatened to kill her if she ever left him
my daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama
vaughan hes real good to mama
vaughan that you met
but hes not able to do anything to doyle hes funny you know
not funny ha ha funny queer
he likes to go with men instead of women
that makes him not to be able to fight too good
he sure is nice though
hes from st
people who are queer can get along better in a big town
he got transferred here to work
but mama said the real reason he left is cause his daddy hated him
for bein the way he is
i wish he liked to go with women
id rather him be mamas boyfriend than doyle
pause as frank looks at the ground again
he seems troubled
pause you know when i said daddy got hit by a train
yeah i remember you a tellin me that
it aint the truth
he shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose
why did he do that reckon
cause he didnt have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to
thats what the letter said
he got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs
i thought he took care of us fine
pause karl did you really kill somebody
yeah i did
who did you kill
were they bad people
i thought they was
maybe they needed it
i growed up and got taught it aint right to kill nobody
its okay if youre lookin out for yourself
if its self defense
was it self defense
karl shifts around and makes a noise in his throat and doesnt answer
my daddy was good
i think too many good people die
it aint right
thats what i think
karl is tying the strap around his books
his sack of toiletries is on the bed
bill cox comes in
now karl you sure you want to go stay with these folks
youre welcome to keep on stayin here
its workin out real good
that boy wants me to
all right then
ill see you bright and early
how you comin along on that garden tiller
i fixed it
hits a workin pretty good
you done fixed it
ill be damned
scooter told me it couldnt be fixed
course scooters about as shitless as one poor son of a bitch can be
you done fixed it
ill just be damned
see you tomorrow
doyle is in the comfortable easy chair with adjuster handle drinking beer
hes in his late thirties and dressed in his construction clothes
linda sits on the arm of the chair and frank stands before them
well honey i dont guess i give a shit
i aint here half the time anyway
if you want a retard livin in the garage i dont guess i care
ive got a good tool box and socket set out there i dont want stold
i guess i could take it home with me
hes real honest
he wouldnt steal nothin
now son i wadnt talkin to you was i
pause was i
no sirs right
im talkin to your mama
this is your mamas decision not yours
im lettin it go on because she asked me not you
to linda now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that cause i have trouble eatin around that kind of thing
just like i am about antique furniture and midgets
i cant so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture
same thing with a droolin retard
doyle youre awful
you shouldnt be that way
i aint sayin its right
im just tellin the truth
what was he in the nuthouse for
hes just mentally retarded i guess
he had of went nuts and did somethin
they dont put you in there for just bein a retard
theys retards all over the place that aint in the nuthouse
do you know frank
i aint sure
you might want to find out
he might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin
yeah thats right frank you better ask him
i mean dont hurt his feelins or anything but it would be good to know
im sure its nothin
he seems real sweet
you sure are hung up on people bein sweet
takes a long pull on his beer speakin of which wheres your girlfriend
i thought he was comin by here for something
hell be here in a little while hes takin me to get an ice cream
aint that the sweetest thing
what am i supposed to do about supper with you traipsin around with that fag
youre not crippled

it kinda makes me horny when you talk back
frank why dont you go off and play in your room if doyles gonna talk nasty
i want to watch t
yeah honey let the kid watch t
hell lets all watch t
like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here
karl is standing on the porch with his bag and his books staring at the door
after a moment we hear a car door slam and footsteps on the porch
then we hear vaughans voice
karl turns to face vaughan
so youre really going to stay here
that boy wants me to
did you knock on the door yet
naw i aint
how long have you been standing here
quite a spell i reckon
listen before you get very used to staying here i think you and i need to talk about a few things
can i take you to lunch
i done et just a little bit ago
i mean tomorrow or the next day
i reckon i can stand to eat a little somethin or nother at noontime tomorrow
bill cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters
but i reckon he can lay off doin it tomorrow
okay ill come by mr
coxs and get you at noon
they stand therefor a moment
vaughan doesnt really know exactly what else to do so he knocks on the door
after a moment frank answers the door
yall come on in
vaughan ushers karl in and they stand behind the sofa
doyle looks up and grins
how are you karl
tolerable i reckon
in a hurry to get out karl this is my boyfriend doyle
frank why dont you and karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin
vaughan you ready to go
sure i guess
dont rush everbody honey
she starts to get her things together
to frank maybe you and karl want to go with us
naw i dont want to
me and karl got things we need to do
hey vaughan you know what i heard
i heard you been puttin it to albert sellers that works over at the funeral home
i know albert
i heard you was more than friends
i heard dick rivers caught yall all bowed up and goin at it in the same room with poor little old mizz ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed
out on a gurney
thats just a total lie
lets go vaughan
they start for the door frank well be back in a little while
ill bring you back somethin
youre foods in the oven warmin over
see you made him somethin
hey vaughan i was just goin on with you jokin around buddy
smiles a little yeah i knew that
youre a card all right
linda kisses frank on the forehead and they leave
so karl come have a seat talk to me
karl sits on the couch
come on karl lets go out to the garage
goddamnit im talkin to the man
you set right there karl
frank leans on the sofa arm beside karl
whats in your bag
this and that
toothpaste and whatnot
whats all them books
the bibles one of em
you believe in the bible
a good deal of it i reckon
cant understand all of it
well i cant understand none of it
this one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another
just how retarded are you
stop it doyle
you be quiet frank were talkin
the adults are talkin
were you in the lockup for cuttin somebody up with a hatchet
i aint never used no hatchet that i remember
youre just crazy in a retarded kind of way then
pause it wouldnt matter to me if you did do violence on somebody cause i aint afraid of shit
you think im afraid for you to stay here
youre just a humped over retard it looks like to me
not really im just jokin with you
welcome to our humble home buddy
frank needs all the friends he can get
franks a real weak little kid
his daddy taught him how to be a pussy
stop it doyle
dont talk about daddy you hear me
mocking dont talk about daddy
yall go on to the garage and let me be
frank is crying now
come on karl
they get up and walk away
yelling to frank dont tell your mama we had a little spat
she dont need to be worried with your ass
karl sits on an old sofa and frank sits on an upside down paint bucket still upset
id like to kill that son of a bitch
i hate him
you ort not to talk that way
youre just a boy
well i hate him
he ort not to talk that away to you neither
he aint no count
hes mean to you and your mama
pause yore mama and that feller thats carryin me to get somethin deats gonna be back here directly
will you stay here with us for a long time
i reckon if you want me to
pause i got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some
i dont see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides its made out of
i reckon it tastes pretty good to me
i like the way you talk
i like the way you talk
karl starts to put together a cracker and potted meat delight as we vaughan is carrying a tray of food as karl follows him to a table and they sit
and immediately start to eat
after a few bites vaughan starts to speak in an official manner
okay karl the reason i brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind
pauses for a response instead karl eats french fries and stares at the table i guess ill put it right out on the table
where do i start
linda and frank are very important to me
theyre like family
my own family was never like family
theyre horrible people
as a matter of fact i prayed every night for years that my father would die
i finally realized through a lot of therapy that i was wasting my energy on hating him
now i just dont care
pause you see you and i are a lot alike strange as that may seem
i mean not physically or even mentally really just well maybe emotionally or actually the hand weve been dealt in life
people see us as being different anyway
youre well you have your affliction or whatever and i well mines not as easy to see
im just going to say it
watts does that surprise you
watts that im gay
you know what being gay is dont you
i reckon not
i like men
not funny ha ha funny queer
well thats a very offensive way to put it
you shouldnt say that
you were taught that werent you
ive heard it said that way
anyway its hard to live gay thats the right way to say it in a small town like this
ive wanted to leave many times but my love for linda and frank and another certain person that we wont go into have kept me from it
anyway im rambling
if youre going to live in the wheatly garage you need to know that it wont be easy
doyle is a monster
not just a closed minded redneck but a monster
a dangerous person
ive told linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy
maybe even kill one of them
i see it in his eyes
im very in tune maybe even psychic
doyle will make your life hell
youre a perfect target
when i first saw you i was afraid of you
not really afraid i guess just taken aback
but also i felt a real sensitive feeling from you
and for some reason frank has adopted you
much like a stray animal
im sorry i didnt mean it like that
in a good way
anyway i just want you to know what youre in for
i have a good feeling about you
youre good for frank
maybe its that he can have an adult friend on a childs level
im sorry i didnt mean it in a bad way
pause theres one more thing
its none of my business why you were in the state hospital
everyone has something in their past maybe you tried suicide maybe you did something terrible
but what i see before me is a gentle simple man
all i want you to promise me is that youre capable of being around linda and frank
you would never hurt them under any circumstances would you
i wouldnt never hurt them
thats what i thought
i hope i havent offended you in any way
you seem like a thinker
you seem to always be in deep thought
tell me something
what are you thinking right now
karl looks up and stares for a moment
i was thinkin i could use me another helpin of these potaters
how about before that
before that i was thinkin itd be good if i could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry
linda frank and doyle are eating
how come karl wont eat here with us
i dont know
he just said hed eat out there
well i wouldnt let it get to you
i just feel sorry for the poor thing
who could eat with him settin there makin that goddamn racket with his throat
he does make some funny noises
i sure like the way he talks
it sounds like a race car motor idlin
it makes me not be nervous
im glad of it honey
what have you got to be nervous about
youre a damn kid
you aint got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time
i get nervous thats all i know
they eat in silence for a while
linda and frank know where this conversation could lead and know when to leave well enough alone
you know what by god
you know what we ought to do tonight
please doyle dont
have a damn party
call morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off
id like to show that fuckin karl to the guys
theyd get a kick out of that
dont you know they would
im not up for it
they always stay till mornin
im just give out doyle
you dont have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low
last time you got mad and run morris and them off and said to stay away from here
that aint none of your damn bidness
besides thats the way friends do one another
fuck it im gonna go call em
honey find my guitar i think its out there in the garage with that loony tune
karl sits on his cot eating from the plate frank brought him
frank and linda come through the door
frank comes and sits beside karl
linda gets a guitar case down from a shelf and comes over and stands in front of karl
karl now listen theres gonna be a party tonight here at the house
doyles invited his music playin buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio
they aint even no good
the only one can play is randy horsefeathers
he claims hes an indian
his real names randy collins and he works at the feed mill
he can at least play guitar
hes no more an indian than i am though
anyhow doyles gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends
just like he does to frank and me sometimes
you just ignore it
or stay out here away from em if hell let you
hes an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight hell get drunk
i guarantee it
he aint ever okay to me
the garage door opens and doyle appears
he seems really happy
well its on
were gonna rock
linda call vaughan
tell him to get over here
id like him to be here
i owe him a good time
vaughan dont want to come to a party with you
too late honey
done called him
hell be here
grins or ill go get him
come on karl i need you to help me ice down a tub of beer you and frank
white christmas tree lights are strung above the patio
karl sits to the side in a kitchen chair staring at the ground alongside vaughan frank and linda
the band is set up on the patio
the band consists of morris a heavyset guy in a military uniform on tambourine terence a skinny guy in a wheelchair on bass randy a long haired younger guy whos
not an indian on guitar doyle on a guitar which he cant play and monty the johnson johnson a large guy with a zz top beard on drums
a tub of beer is in front of them
theyre all hooting and hollering and drinking
theyve obviously been at it for a while
doyle steps forward to address the crowd
okay ladies and gentlemen points to vaughan or both
its come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band
over here on lead guitar mr
come on hit a hot lick randy
randy plays a lick well come on yall are supposed to clap now
they clap a little except for karl karl you better clap your hands or hell just keep on
karl claps his hands a little
on the bass give it up for terence one ball atkins
more half assed clapping on the tambourine and lyrics morris hobbs the fuckin genius of the group
claps on drums the johnson
claps and last and most importantly doyle hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next
world fuckin tour
come on a big hand for these guys
theyre workin their asses off here
pauses for a slug of beer okay id like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight
to my lovely female companion linda her lovely son frank our new boarder karl whats your last name karl
karl childers just in from the state facility
make one of them gruntin sounds karl or whatever it is you do
nothing oh well karls a little retarded he dont know what the hell im talkin about
and to vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients
now that takes balls
our number one tune for the folks boys
kick it off johnson
they play walk dont run while the audience of four sits in motionless silence
they finish the song and hoot and holler and drink some more and say nasty things to each other
you like that vaughan
it sounded like a number one tune all right
you enjoying yourself karl
we hear the voice of an old man neighbor in the near distance
i wished you all would lay off for tonight
i cant hear myself think for that racket
its nighttime now let folks be
ill call the law
hollers back i told you already three times the laws on my side
i play cards with j
shelnutt chief of police
get fucked you old bastard
to the party okay now linda you and the kid clean up and get a tarpaulin over this instruments
me and the boys are goin to the county line
were out of liquor and beer
come on karl you and vaughan are goin with us
id better go on home now its late
i have to work tomorrow
come on dont be a pussy
everybody has to work
he dont want to doyle
dont go vaughan if you dont want to
youll wreck doyle youre drunk
very sincere but honey ill be good
i love you sweetie
im just tryin to help these two be part of things
doyle is driving vaughan in the middle and karl by the window
doyle cranks up the truck and pops in a cassette tape
the first few notes of ghost riders in the sky play
are you sure you can drive
youve really had a lot of alcohol
this is the national anthem
they take off tires screaming on the pavement as the song goes louder
the truck fishtails into the night and we see the rest of the band in the back of the truck trying to control terences wheelchair as it rolls back and
points to tape player not that you afflicted sons of bitches would know anything about it but this is art
they are stopped by a red traffic light
a police car pulls up beside them and doyle looks over at the red faced cop on the passenger side and turns down the music
hey freddy whats goin on boy
i seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin that big ass bass
yeah she was a big un
you aint drunk drivin are you doyle
i figured that
well you better be careful with that cripple in the back
youll throw him out
looks like you got a wagonful
we run outta somethin to drink
goin to the county line
you want to race
laughing you know better than that
were on duty
catch me in that camaro next week one night
catch you later freddy
doyle peels out and the music blares again
i bet you like sittin between two men in a dual wheel truck dont you
oh yeah im thrilled
pause you know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight
wed be glad to have you
doyle slouches in his chair drinking whiskey from the bottle
terence and morris are sitting facing karl and vaughan who are on the sofa
randy and the johnson are sitting across the room in straight backed chairs drinking beer
they really stocked up at the county line and beer and liquor bottles are strewn everywhere
morris is in the middle of a monologue which has obviously been going on for awhile
anyhow im not sure if you follow me on those particular points but its not really important in the smaller picture which is where most people dwell anyway
not that being manager of bens dollar store is insignificant
or that making it through years of incarceration in a state supported facility is any small feat
morris hes the only one in the band that went to college
im in junior college right now over in westfield
that aint no college thats trade school
auto repair aint ever made a genius out of nobody
holidays are for campers
what do you know about bein a genius johnson
you cant even hardly keep a steady beat on that high price drum set
i think yall play really tight together randy
yall shouldnt throw off on one another
anything that has to be discussed cant mean anything
you got that shit right
what exactly do you mean by that
i dont understand
exactly the point my young levelheaded friend
i dont get it
i rest my case
morris is real smart with philosophies and things
thats why him and me are the songwriting team of our group
i make up good tunes or melodies as we call them and morris is the lyrics
not unlike gary brooker of the protocol harum
we dont ever play any songs that yall wrote
i never even heard one of em
yall just talk
we dont even play any songs with words at all that i remember
we aint got no fuckin microphone
or speaker set up
we wrote one last night standin outside mini mart
morris called it stuart drives a comfortable car
then you know like on country songs in parenthesis it says there is usually someone in the trunk
i came up with a tune just humming
see vaughan you shouldnt question a genius
morris is a modern day poet like in the old days
our latest composition is as follows entitled the thrill i stand on the hill not for a thrill but for a breath of a fresh kill never mind the man
who contemplates doing away with license plates he stands alone anyway baking the cookies of discontent by the heat of a laundrymat vent leaving his soul then like in poetry i have dot dot dot then drop down to the next line kind of off center
leaving his soul parting waters under the medulla oblongata of then dot dot dot again mankind
silence for a moment as everyone in the room just stares at something other than morris
i dont think thats right
i believe dot dot dot come between medulla and oblongata or something like that
morris stares at him well it did
it wadnt before mankind i know that much
the dots are where i say they are
melody and tune
thats your trade
youre a tunesmith terence
i dont really understand the meaning of the words
if yall dont shut up im gonna go out of my mind
and plus youre liable to bust a spring in karls head
hes already off balance
that wadnt the way you made it up before morris
thats all i know
we dont need fancy words we need to practice
we dont ever rehearse
we need some payin gigs instead of just messin around on first one patio and then anothern
morris you should just be the manager you cant play nothin anyway
doyle jumps up and throws his whiskey bottle through the window
he has changed from groggy drunk to a wild eyed madman in a flash
we dont have a goddamn band
yall just shut the fuck up
we dont need no practicin or managers cause we aint no fuckin band
morris aint no genius and the rest of you are just losers
am i the only one sane human bein around here
just get the hell out of my house and dont come back
its not your house doyle its lindas
ill kill you you fuckin faggot
you mind your own business
now get out
now before i get too mad to turn back
what about our instruments
doyle grabs the handles of terences wheelchair and pushes him right out the screen door
we hear the chair clatter down the steps and a cry of pain from terence
they all file out the door except vaughan and karl who sit frozen on the sofa
turning back you aint right doyle
somethins wrong with you
nobody needs your shit
stops at the door the dots just look good on paper
you dont sing em anyway
youre showing your true aries colors now
get out of my goddamn face you fuckin buzzard
he slams the door and turns to see vaughan and karl on the sofa and linda and frank in their nightclothes standing in the doorway
i thought i told everybody to get out of my house
that includes cocksuckers and retards
get off your asses and go
this is not your house doyle
this is my house and ill say who stays and goes
youve got a house why dont you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it
you know better than to talk like that when im hurtin
dont make me knock the piss out of you
doyle dont you lay one hand on her
to linda you go to bed and take snot nose with you
linda walks up to him with frank close behind
vaughan gets up also
karl stares at the floor rubbing his hands together
youre not stayin here tonight
go get sober before you come back
im tired of my child seein this
now you get yourself straight or ill lock your ass out of my life for good
you know what i told you you even think of leavin me ill kill you dead as a doornail
that might be better than this
im a witness
i heard you threaten her life
i thought i told you to keep out
dont tell me what to do
dont tell me what to do
dont tell me what to do
an inch from her face dont tell me what to do
she shoves him in the chest and he slaps her hard in the face
vaughan starts looking for a weapon and frank goes wild
he starts throwing anything he can find at doyle
empty cans bottles a lampstand
he connects with an encyclopedia to the head
doyle goes to the door
his face has changed from angry to sad almost pitiful
okay ill leave and sober up
everythings botherin me thats all
im hurtin linda
i love you
i hate you
well i hate you too
no i dont
i love your mama
nobody understands what i go through
you bunch of freaks have fun
ill call you tomorrow honey
you can kiss my ass really
to frank you ever hit me again you little bastard and ill make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out
he leaves and slams the door
frank goes to lindas side as does vaughan
you all right mama
im fine honey
lets just try and forget about tonight
we dont need to think bad thoughts do we mama
no honey we dont
pause ill make some coffee and start cleanin up this mess
karl you want some coffee huh
coffee kindly makes me nervous when i drink it
linda cleaning up the last of the mess
frank comes in sleepy eyed in his pajamas
what are you doin up again frank
you need to get a little sleep
did vaughan go home
yeah he has to go to work in a little while
i do too
did karl go to bed
he went to the garage
poor thing hes probably never seen such a crazy mess
he probably wants to go back and live in mr
i bet he dont
karl likes me
i know he does
is everything gonna be all right someday
i just stay nervous all the time just about
yeah honey someday everythings gonna be all right
doyle wouldnt really kill you would he
i promise were gonna get away from him
the time has to be right thats all
id rather him get tired of me and leave me
then he wouldnt want to hurt me
he wouldnt care then
well be fine
you go to bed now
she hugs him i love you
i love you too mama
he goes to his room
linda goes into the kitchen and pours a cup of coffee and sits at the table
after a moment she looks up and is startled to see karl in the doorway
you scared me
i didnt aim to
want to sit down
did you need somethin
karl just keeps standing there and linda keeps staring
two fellers was on a bridge a takin a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water
one of em came from arkansas i believe
puzzled ill be dog
do you reckon you can make me some biscuits
just whenever you take a notion to
i dont aim to put you out
well it is nearly breakfast time anyway
i cant go to sleep
i have to be at work in three hours
you know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two you feel worse than if you hadnt slept at all
well set down and ill make some biscuits and gravy
mustards good on em to me
karl sets at the table and linda starts to make the biscuits
its all right
pause you know i was thinkin theres this girl that works with me
shes real heavy but shes cute in the face
well you know shes slow
shes a little bit i think
shes not retarded just it dont matter listen to me
i thought you might like to meet her
vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her
would you like that
i wouldnt mind a havin supper
vaughans friend will be there too
he works at the funeral home
you know frank likes you a lot
he says you make him feel calm
i like frank
hes a good boy
me and hims made friends
she keeps working
hit aint right for me to keep from tellin you how come me to be put in the state hospital
its not really my business
i have wondered though
why was it
was it like a nervous breakdown
i killed my mother and a old boy name jesse dixon
i thought they was a doin wrong
i was about your boys age
they say im well now from it
linda stops working and turns to karl a little shocked but not as much as you would think
was that you
i remember that
i was only three or four but i always heard about it growin up
pause they say youre well
pause i like your garage
pause i wouldnt never hurt you or your boy
id lay my hand on the bible and say the same thing
i believe you
i really do
bill cox is standing beside a garden tiller with an old man
bill is trying to crank it up but it wont start
a car pulls into the parking lot and gerry woolridge gets out of it and comes over to bill
how bout you jerry
how are you bill
doin pretty good

whats got you down this way
just thought id check on karl and see if everythings working out
well hes pretty quiet
except for them rackets and breathin things he does
aint threatened me with a killin or anything
laughs but boy you couldnt of been more right about him fixin things
that son of a bitch is a regular eli whitney on a lawnmower
loves french fries
eats four larges and dont even so much as belch
im proud to have him
is him stayin here workin out
hes gone to stayin over with that wheatley boy and his mama in their garage
i think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot
but hes got a key here to come and go as he pleases
everythings worked out good
can i see him
bill looks over at scooter who is putting up a sale sign on new mowers in the front window
run get karl for me
woolridge and karl lean on the hood of woolridges car
in the background bill and the old man tinker with the tiller
are you sure youre okay staying with that woman and boy
do they know about you
i told em about it
they know im well
that mizz wheatley made me some biscuits
that boy hes my friend
he likes the way i talk and i like the way he talks
i knew youd do all right
well i just wanted to check on you
ill say bye to bill and get on back
they walk over to bill
karl see if you can figure out whats wrong with this thing
it wont crank up and everthing seems to be put together right
karl squats beside the tiller
ill see you bill
okay stop back by
dont worry about your boy here hes doin good
karl looks up from the tiller holding the gas cap
hit aint got no gas in it
thinks of the simplest thing first
vaughan albert the friend linda frank karl and melinda the dollar store girl are seated at the table
karl and frank are going at the delicacies while melinda shyly picks at hers and the others are engaged in idle chit chat
this goes on for a few moments then alberts attention turns to karl
so karl do you intend to stay in the lawnmower business for a while or do you have other plans
i think karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually
you should see all the books he has
he must read constantly
i aint read em yet except two or three of em
i cant understand a lot of what i try to read
my mind hit wonders off to somethin else when i try to read
im the same way
of course in my line of work i stay too busy to read
but at least i have job security
people may stop doing a lot of things but one thing is for sure they wont stop dying
looks at frank why dont we talk about something a little more festive
does everyone like the food
nods and yeses
i havent decided yet if im a good cook
hey karl you know what
melinda was voted employee of the month at the dollar store last february
isnt that somethin
yes maam i reckon
well when you like pricing items as much as i do i guess its just bound to happen sooner or later
karl maybe you and melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner
its a nice night
vaughan dont get pushy
i like walkin quite a bit from time to time
i stay on my feet all the time at work
i just cant find shoes thats comfortable
hospital shoes might be the answer
or the kind old ladies who work in the school cafeteria wear
i get real mean when my feet hurt
its the only time i dont like checkin out the customers when my feet hurt
frank you and karl arent talkin much you boys must really like that food
i just dont have anything to say about shoes
silence for a moment
listen everybody i know this may sound corny ive had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional but im going to say it
it just came over me in a rush
i want you all to know that i care about each and every one of you at this table
thats very sweet of you vaughan
we care about you too
dont we yall
nods grunts sure dos
also melinda please dont tell anybody at the store that albert was here tonight okay
well a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors
unfortunately i have to keep certain parts of my life private
you mean about yall bein together in that way
i think everybody at the store knows that already
they always talk about it
maureen ledbetter told a awful story about why you aint allowed over at the first baptist church no more
karl why dont you and melinda go take a walk
its nice out
all right then
he gets up and walks toward the front door
melinda gets up and tries to catch up
karl and melinda are walking in the moonlight
it seems a little hard for melinda to keep up
you walk fast dont you
they walk a little farther in silence
these is the worst shoes i own for walkin
how far did you want to go
i aint really thought about it too much i dont reckon
they walk until they disappear into the darkness
karl is on the floor working on a mower with scooter they are ad libbing semi technical lawnmower things
bill cox appears in the door
hey karl theys somebody out here to see you
some gal holding a nice bouquet
karl doesnt move come on now she wants to talk to you
dont just set there
karl gets up and goes to the counter followed by scooter
melinda stands on the other side of the counter holding a cellophane wrapped store bought flower assortment
nobody says anything for a moment
hi karl im on lunch break
these was on sale cause theyre not fresh
two ninety nine a bunch plus my ten percent employee discount
since i didnt bring you anything to our date last night i thought youd like to have em
she hands them to him
scooter lets me and you go over to dairy queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime
i can go
you dont have to
you dont never go
goddamnit scooter come on
pardon my language maam
they start to leave
at the door bill cox turns and winks at karl
they exit leaving karl and melinda staring at the counter
they are silent for a while
well i just thought id give you them
i liked walkin with you
i got a blister the size of a quarter on one heel
well ill see you sometime i guess
she walks to the door and stops as if she expects karl to say something
a blister shore can hurt
flowers is pretty
ive always thought that
she leaves and karl goes to the window holding the flowers and watches her walk away
holding the flowers karl is walking down the sidewalk toward the wheatley house when he sees frank coming out the front door with a book and a flashlight
he sees karl
hey karl you off work
whered you get them flowers
that gal that made employee of the month give em to me for awalkin with her
i was goin to the secret place
i borried one of your books to take down there
you aint mad are you
you can look at all my books you want to
its names a christmas carol
thats than un on christmas i was tellin you about
you want to go with me
karl and frank sit in the clearing karl on the stump frank on the ground
frank is shining the flashlight on the book
he finishes reading a few lines and turns off the flashlight
im gettin tired of readin for a while
all right then
boy folks sure had it rough back a long time ago didnt they
yeah i reckon they did
hit like to tore me up when i read about that pore little cripple boy
yeah me too
pause that was nice of that woman to give you them flowers
hit was right thoughty of her
i was wantin to ask you somethin
all right then
you know that girl i told you about
the one i love
yeah i recollect it
would you go see her with me
i kind of thought i might take her some flowers like that woman done you
if you want me to
i aint got no money to get em with but i bet vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store
i bet he will
i got a little money if he dont
ill get em for ye
i usually get run off by her mama or daddy if theyre home
reckon why they dont like me
they ort to
youre a good boy
just cause im not rich dont mean i dont love her
and i dont try to touch her
you know in a bad way
foolin around sex and all
thats real good
you ort not to if ye aint married to somebody
bible tells you that much
hit tells some things that dont seem right too i reckon
i guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can though
pause you dont touch yourself do you
what do you mean
pull on your works
oh jackin off
you ort not know that language
i didnt know till here while back a year or two ago when i spent the night with ronnie smart one time
he said just tug on your peter and think about your mama
i tried it but i felt funny thinkin about my mama
so i switched over to thinkin about his mama and then what he told me would happen happened
it sure tingles dont it
you ort not to pull on yourself that away
i kind of like you tellin me what to do and not to do
just like my daddy
i didnt mind him tellin me
i hate doyle to tell me what to do
mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us
that we cant leave him or hell try and hurt her
he aint no count
you dont seem like a daddy
you seem like a brother
pause wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you dont even know em like what happened with me and you
i dont reckon i know
and then some people you dont like right off
pause you know why i want you to play ball with me
cause its fun
it dont matter if you aint no good
it takes your mind off of everything else while youre doin it
when you run real fast tryin to make a touchdown you dont think about anything else
i aint no good but my daddy always said he was proud of me when i threw a ball or ran with it
did you have any brothers and sisters growin up to play with
i had one there for little bit
hit didnt get old enough to play with
hit was borned a little too early on
my mother and father made hit come too early some way or other
i reckon they changed their mind about havin anothern
i was about six or eight year old then and they didnt care too much for me so i reckon they didnt need somethin else to worry em with
so it died when it come out
my daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin in it
i went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see cause they was a noise and somethin movin in it
hit was bloody like around that towel
hit was a little ol bitty baby no bigger than a squirrel
it was alive
right then it was
a boy or girl
a little ol boy
you threw it in a trash barrel
i didnt feel right about doin that
i takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried
him in the corner of the yard there
that seemed more proper to me i reckon
it was still alive when you buried it
i heared it cryin a little through that box
that dont seem right
it seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother
i wadnt but six or eight
i reckon i didnt know what to do
i didnt know how to care for no baby
mama and daddy didnt want him
they learned me to do what they told me to
these days i figure it might of been best to give him right back to the good lord right off the bat anyhow
that makes me feel real sad
couldnt you have done somethin karl
i would have
i wish i would of had him
hed be here right now
hits been hard thinkin about it
they aint a day goes by i dont think about it
i kindly have a picture of it up in my head that i see
hit makes me sad too
i have bad thoughts on it
i wished they was somethin i could of did too
shouldnt no bad things happen to childern
all the ol bad things ort to be saved up for folks thats growed up the way i see it
i shouldnt of told you about that
a boy ort not hear about such things
it just kindly come out
i didnt mean to say anything bad about you
i know youre good
you didnt mean no harm
pause did you ever think about killin yourself on purpose like my daddy did
ive studied about it
the bible says not to or you end up goin to hades
some folks calls it hell i call it hades
bible says the same thing about killin others too
yes sir i reckon it does
frank flowers in hand and karl approach a very nice two story house
they get to the door and frank rings the doorbell
i always get nervous when i hear that doorbell
im okay just walkin over but somethin about that dang doorbell
they have one room where you cant walk on the carpet or sit on the furniture
i dont see much sense in havin it
the door opens and we see an older black lady the eyes karl son i dont know why you keep comin over here
you know these folks dont want you here
they run you off ever time
dont keep doin this to yourself
you a sweet boy
now go give them flowers to somebody thatll enjoy em
maam i really want to give them to karen
to karl you his daddy
well whoever you are you ought to talk some sense into him
that little old girl is way too fast for him and dont wanna see him no way
will you get her for me
i really want to see her
shell want to see me too cause were not in public
just dont tell her folks im here
she disappears and a moment later karen appears
shes thirteen pretty and very neatly dressed
put out hey frank
you shouldnt be coming over here
my parents really dont want you to
i wanted to bring you some flowers
theyre pretty good ones
theyre from the dollar store
im not an idiot
besides we have a garden full of flowers
she eyes karl
i wanted for you to meet karl too
hes my new friend
but i feel like ive always known him
i thought you should meet him
hes gonna be around a lot and i hope you are too so
here give me the flowers ill do something with them
now you better go
maybe ill see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something
i have a boyfriend now you know
and were pretty serious
he gave me a ring
she proudly displays the ring
can you go there with us now
me and karl
we could just hang out
karl has some cool books
frank i just like you as a friend
only at the secret place
i cant go there now
ill see you later
but maybe just for awhile im closing the door now
i told you ill see you later
she closes the door
they stand therefor a moment then walk away down the sidewalk
she said shed see me later
thats kinda good right
frank and karl walk up the steps to the house
frank opens the door and they enter
as frank and karl enter they see doyle sitting on a footstool facing linda whos in a chair
doyle is holding both her hands and talking very softly to her
he sees the guys and looks up
well ill be damned theres the boys
im glad yall came in
i wanted to talk to yall too
i was just tellin linda here oh hell ill just start over set down you boys
they do on the couch
well what it is is i just well i took off work early today and your mama was good enough to do the same so we could talk
i guess youd say im really here to apologize which aint easy for me to do about the way i acted the other night
i was just drunk and kinda got a little too worked up and one thing led to another
i care about yall a lot i do
i dont mean to be so damned assholish i guess the word would be
now karl i dont believe i hit you did i
so no apology needed there i guess but frank im sorry
im sorry i hit your mama
im just jealous of her
i dont like her life or the way she runs it
i dont like homosexuals and she buddies with one
i dont like little wimpy ass kids or fuckin mental retards and shes got one of each livin with her
laughs i was just kiddin
but really i guess people need to get along even if they have differences
pause you see i work construction
i build things
do you realize how important that is to the world
i have a lot of pressure on me
the upshot is im gonna spend a lot more time over here and were gonna get along
like a family should
to linda i may even surprise you one day and pop the question
he gets up well im goin back to work
i just wanted to give yall some little piece of happiness today
kisses linda see you tonight honey
be a good boy frank
well at least hes tryin
but who knows for how long
hes lyin mama
he aint gonna do better
i know honey
just remember what i said well bide our time
you just steer clear of him as much as you can
doyles had a real hard life
its just about run him crazy i think
weve had a real hard life too mama
linda moves to the couch and puts her arms around frank
youre a hell of a boy frank
someday youre gonna get all the good things you deserve
and karl heres gonna get some more biscuits tonight
what do you think about that
i could shore use some
karl is cleaning some parts in a bucket of gasoline
bill comes to the door
hey there karl can you come unload a generator for me
karl wipes his hands on a shop towel and starts outside
a man and a teenage boy stand by a pickup truck
a small generator is on the tailgate
karl lift this thing down and carry it to the back
its on the blink
to man as karl unloads it well have it for you in a day or two walter
yont us to hep you there liftin that
oh no that dang karl can lift a bulldozier
fix anything too
confidentially hes mentally retarded but hes a whiz on small engines
lord works in mysterious ways
karl carries the generator toward the shop
he turns and watches the man and boy talking and laughing with bill
the man playfully puts an arm around his sons neck and tousles his hair
hell he didnt just make the team coach says hes probably gonna start at end on defense
hes a chip off the old block
aint you steve
i guess so
karl turns and goes in the shop
karl is on his cot reading a book
frank comes in
he looks very depressed
he sits beside karl
what you readin
readin on this book on how to work carpentry
i aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times
ive always been partial to wood buildins and cabinets and whatnot
these drawins they got here dont make no sense to me so far
he looks directly at frank which he seldom does you seem like yore tails adraggin a might
you got somethin wrong with ye
seems like doyles wormed his way back in
mama said hes stayin over tonight and hes talkin about movin in for good
we aint ever gonna be happy
well always be nervous wont we karl
i dont reckon i know
i aint found no way yet and im three or four times as old as you
might be thats just the way folks is
i feel sad about karen cross too
i just make like to myself she loves me
i know better though
it just feels good to me when i imagine it
make believin always made me feel good too from time to time
they sit in silence for a moment
bill cox is goin to a funeral for a mister turner tomorrow and a closin up shop early
is that right
ill play ball with ye
i reckon if neither one of us is no count it wont make no difference
well be on teams me and you
its the practice field so its not very well kept
karl frank and two other boys around franks age are huddled up
four boys are lined on defense
they break the huddle and come to the line
they are on about the fifty yard line
frank hikes the ball to one of the boys
he later als it to karl who stands there for a minute as the defenders run toward him
then he takes off like the wind
he runs funny kind of humped over and pigeon toed but fast
all the others are chasing him
two of the other teams boys catch him on about the fifteen yard line but he drags them along
karl sees frank out of the corner of his eye and tosses him the ball just as karl bites the dirt
frank goes into the end zone untouched
there are cheers from frank and the other boys
frank runs over to karl whos still on the ground
way to go karl
we got a touchdown
that was a good lateral man
that was just like the wishbone
i dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a hold of me there so i figured i better give it off to you
i seen you over there follerin me
were liable to win if we keep this up
for somebody like you you sure run fast
he grabs karl by the hands and helps pull him up
come on lets kick off to em
karl and frank dirt grass stains and all walk toward home
i know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing em over to me
them boys was tryin to pull me down pretty hard
youre strong though
you let me make them touchdowns so id feel good
my daddy used to do that kind of thing
they walk in silence for a moment
it dont matter to me about us losin does it to you
it was fun anyhow
i wadnt thinkin about nothin else just like you told me id do
can we play ever saturday
if i aint too stove up
i aint like you
im old and give out
pause im proud of ye
karl sits on his bed rubbing his hands together deep in thought
karl is walking down the street past rundown houses
he comes to an old gray woodframe house
it is in bad repair the paint is peeling the yard is grown up
there is an old wooden shed in the back yard
he stands looking at it for a moment then walks through the yard and opens the door to the shed
hes motionless for a moment then goes inside
sunlight comes through the cracks in the wood
the shed has nothing but dirt for a floor
a few tall patches of grass shoot up between boxes and rusty lawnmowers
a few old garden tools hang on the wall
in the center is a low circular spot in the ground and a few tattered shreds of an old quilt
karl stands looking at the hole for a moment then turns and walks out of the shed
karl walks across the yard to the house
karl goes onto the screened in porch looks through the kitchen window and goes inside
the place is a mess
dirty dishes are piled in the sink and on the table
its not just clutter but filth everywhere
karl walks into an equally filthy living room where an old man in overalls sits slumped in a chair looking at his lap
karl stands facing him for several moments
im ye boy
i aint got no boy
im ye oldest boy name karl
i aint got no boy
they turned me aloose from the nervous hospital
said i was well
i got hired to work for a mr
cox fixin lawnmowers and whatnot
that grass out in the yards all growed up
i figured i might cut it fer ye
i told you i aint got no boy now get on out from here and let me be
i learned to read some
ive read on the bible quite a bit
i dont understand all of it but i believe i understand a good deal of it
them stories mama and you told me aint in there
you ort not to of done that to ye boy
pause ive studied on killin you
but i dont reckon theys no reason fer it if all youre gonna do is set there in that chair
youll be dead soon enough i reckon and the worldll be shut of ye
karl walks toward the kitchen and turns back to the old man you ort not to of killed my brother
he ort to have had a chance to grow up
sometimes he would of had fun
karl walks out of the house and across the yard to a hedge in the corner and kneels down
he pushes some grass aside to reveal a rock about afoot tall and afoot across
in front of it the ground is raised a little
he stares at the rock for a moment and touches it
karl stands on the side of the bridge looking into the river below
all the lights are out
we see a shot of frank in his bed asleep but tossing and turning
then a shot of linda in bed staring at the ceiling and doyle beside her snoring
suddenly the lights come on and linda lets out a little yelp and sits up which wakes up doyle and he sits up with a start
from their p
we see karl standing in the door holding a hammer
what in the goddamn hell are you doin
its the middle of the night
what do you want hun
i want to be baptized
well get baptized then
i dont give a shit
call a fuckin preacher goddamnit
i cant baptize you
well go to church and get you baptized tomorrows sunday

what are you doin with that damn hammer
i dont rightly know
i just kindly woke up a holdin it
we see a shot of frank and linda and vaughan in a church pew
the church is pretty full
from their p
we seek karl in a robe standing in the baptismal tank
the preacher takes karl and dunks him under the water and brings him back up
doyle is in his favorite chair as linda frank and karl come through the front door
howd your baptizin go
it went real good
well thats good
its about time to eat and you know what im cravin

ill be back in a little bit then
she leaves and doyle walks up to karl and frank
i really just wanted to git your mama out of the house for a minute so we can have a talk
yall set down
they sit on the couch and doyle kneels in front of them
now heres the deal
now that im gonna throw my entire life away doin what i want to come live here with yall we have to get a few things straight
see frank me and you mama wouldnt have any problems if it wadnt for you
wed never have a bad word between us
but since you do exist if im gonna be here as the head of the household well have to live by my rules

and the other thing is your friend karl has to go
we cant have a normal family with him livin in the garage and comin in the bedroom at four in the mornin with hammers and shit
karl can stay if he wants to
mama said doyle slaps him across the face and karl grabs doyles arm
doyle shakes him off
dont hit that boy no more
you shut up you fuckin retard
get your shit and get out of here
to frank that was a wake up slap frank
reality like i said
dont forget any bit of what i said to you and well be fine
frank jumps up and runs from the house and doyle sits back in his chair and pops a beer
karl gets up and goes to the garage
karl ties his books up with his strap and gets a bag from his bed and leaves
karl is walking away as linda pulls up in her car and gets out with fast food bags
where are you goin karl
didnt you want some chicken and things
im agoin off sommers
i got you some
frank he went off too
he aint gonna be in there when you get indoors

i dont get to see him all day except sundays

i wouldnt know what to do without him either
youve been real good to me too
it aint everbody thatd make biscuits in the middle of the night
you and that boy has give me a good feelin
we sure like havin you
karl walks away then turns im just getting around to tellin you but i fixed your warshin machine
frank is on the ground digging a trench in the dirt with a stick
he hears footsteps in the leaves and looks up and sees karl coming toward him
howd you know to come out here
i knowed youd be here
karl sits on the stump what are you a doin digging with that stob
pause i aint ever gonna be happy now
not with that son of a bitch movin in for good
i wish me and you and mama could just run away
but she said he would find us wherever we went
sometimes i think it would of been better if i wadnt ever born
im glad of it you was borned
pause i reckon i aint gonna be there in the garage no more
you have to karl
you have to look out for me
you dont let that son of a bitch run you off
youre just a boy
you ort not to use that sort of language
karl i aint tryin to say nothin bad about you but why dont you stop doyle when he gets that away
youre older than him
youre strong too
my daddy wouldnt let him do that to me and mama
that fellers a whole sight meaner than me
hed just whup the tar out of me

i care for you more than anybody they is
we made friends right off the bat
i care for you too
but youll be around dont say that
hit dont make no difference where i was to be
well always be friends
there aint no way to stop that
pause i aim for you to have these books
he hands him the books
maybe you can make more sense out of them than i can
i made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on christmas
you dont want to give away all your books
i aim fer you to have em
pause you know when you get a feelin and you dont know why
ive got a feelin today

i dont know
pause youre leavin aint you karl

i want you to give me your word on it
i give you my word
is everthing gonna be okay
are you all right
everthings okay boy
i kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then im gonna go on and leave here
karl lays his arm on franks shoulder and frank puts his hand on karls arm
they sit like that for a few moments then karl gets up with his paper sack and walks away
frank takes the book marker out of the christmas book
it is just a folded piece of notebook paper
on it is written you will be happy
he looks up at karl who is now thirty yards away in the trees
karl turns around and he and frank stare at each other through the trees
karl knocks on the door
after a moment vaughan answers in a pair of big shorts and a sweatshirt
karl what are you doing here
i aint a stayin
i need to ast you fer a favor
this evenin i want you to go get mizz wheatley and that frank and have them stay with you tonight
is everything okay

hands the bag to vaughan i want ye to give this to mizz wheatley
hit aint much but maybe theres a little somethin to hep out
hits what ive earned fixin lawnmowers and whatnot fer bill cox
vaughan takes the bag
what about you karl
do you want to stay here
i dont reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy
pause youve been real square dealin with me
the bible says two men ort not lay together
but ill bet you the good lord wouldnt send nobody like you to hades
some folks calls it hell i call it hades
karl starts away that boy lives inside of his own heart
hits an awful big place
you take care of that boy
vaughan watches karl walk away
karl stares at the bus station door
karl stares at the house from the sidewalk
karl stares into the river
karl has a lawnmower blade sharpening it on a grinding wheel
karl carrying the blade walks onto the porch and enters the living room
doyle is in his chair drinking beer and watching tv
he looks up as karl comes around and sits on the sofa
wheres everbody else
you seen em
no response i thought i told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway
how does a feller go about gettin ahold of the police
pick up the fuckin phone and call em i guess
what numbers do you punch
i told you to get away from here didnt i
im tryin to relax and look at tv
notices blade what are you doin with that piece of iron
i swear to god youre the weirdest son of a bitch i ever heard of
i aim to kill you with it
doyle keeps drinking and watching tv
well to get the police you push
youll need to tell em to send an ambulance too
or a hearse
you fuckin idiot
youre gonna kill me
laughs karl gets up and walks slowly toward doyle out of frame
we see the flickering light of the tv on the wall
we hear one short dull thud
we hear one more thud then the sound of doyles body hitting the floor
karl appears in frame again and we follow him to the kitchen where he picks up the wall phone
he stares at it for a moment then pushes
he has a few specks of blood on his face hand and shirt
into phone yes maam
i need the police over here at the wheatley house
pause ive killed somebody with a mower blade
pause yes maam im right sure of it
i hit him two good whacks
that second time just plumb near cut his head in two
pause hits a little old yeller house right on the corner of marigold street and some other street
theys a red pickup truck out front says doyle hargraves construction on it

beside sendin the police doyle said you might want to send a ambulance or a hearse
he hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar of mustard
he gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the kitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering up some leftovers
he picks up a biscuit and opens the mustard jar and runs the knife around it
theres hardly any mustard in it
he dabs a little on the biscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law
hes in the middle of one of his sick monologues
we pull back and see were in the recreation room of the hospital again with karl in his usual chair listening to charles
karl is now wearing the hospital issue clothing
on the third day i washed her
she wasnt very clean
i got all the right spots
she was the first one i ever kept for any length of time you see i get bored easily i have a short attention span
i cant say she enjoyed her stay although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum
i dont really like people who talk a lot
i like to do the talking
i guess thats why im so fond of you
youre so easygoing although i do sense a little tension in you sometimes
by the way how was it out there
did you have any fun
make any new acquaintances
tell me what it was like
they was a boy
we made friends
i bet you did
i was never bent that way
im bent the other way
so you liked it out there in the world
its too big
well its not too big in here is it
pause i feel very generous today
i feel like listening
im sure you have plenty to tell me
and please bore me with the details
long pause come on karl who did you kill
was it the boy
dont say nothin about that boy
karl looks him right in the eye for the first time ever
fact the bidness dont you say another word to me
i aint listenin to you no more
karl gets up and goes to the window and looks out at the grass that separates him from the next building
