written by spencer susser david michod july th a small kid tj forney with a grubby worn cast on his arm rides his bmx really fast down a street
he chases a tow truck towing a badly wrecked red volvo
he struggles to keep up
the truck makes a turn
tj follows turning dangerously in front of oncoming traffic
the truck makes another turn
tj turns with it running straight into the side of a car pulling out of a driveway
he comes off his bike and is thrown across the hood
he picks himself up stunned
the driver of the car gets out to see if hes hurt
tj looks down the street to see the tow truck disappearing in the distance
he hurries back to his bike
he jumps on and continues after the truck
tj gives chase
he gains on the truck
he can see it pull into a used car lot ahead fair oaks car city
tj arrives at the car lot as the tow truck driver is lowering the car onto the drive
tj dumps his bike out of breath
this car has to go back
this car has to go back to where it came from
put it back on the truck
what are you talking about kid
the driver continues working unhooking the car from the truck
stop unhooking it
theres been a mistake
i was told to bring it here
thats what it says on my work order
talk to that guy if youve got a problem
the driver nods in the direction of larry towers who is approaching with year old dustin howard and another man tony in dirty overalls
to tow truck driver hey bill
larry shakes the tow truck drivers hand
this car has to go back where it came from
i beg your pardon
it was brought here by mistake
larry smiles at the little out of breath kid
and where was it supposed to go
it wasnt supposed to go anywhere
it needs to go back where it came from
the guy who sold it to you made a mistake
whats the deal with this car again tony
tony flips through a stack of papers hes holding
ah lets see we bought this car yesterday afternoon from a paul forney thats my dad
it wasnt his to sell
well its his name on the pink slip son
and that means its his to sell if he wants
yeah but im just telling you it was a mistake ok so it needs to go back where it came from
the car has now been lowered off the back of the tow truck
larry moves away from tj and approaches the driver
you got that work order there
tony looks through his papers for the work order
tj doesnt like being ignored
he moves around to the drivers side of the wrecked car and wrenches open the bashed in door
he climbs behind the wheel slams the door shut and locks the door
get out of the car son
tj ignores him
larry doesnt have time for this
dustin get him outta there will ya
dustin moves around to the open drivers side window
come on dude get out of the car
tj turns the key and begins winding the window up
dustin reaches in trying to unlock the door
the window is rising
dustin grabs at tj
tj keeps winding the window
it gets to the top trapping dustins arm
what the fuck you doing
dustin is stuck
larry bill and tony laugh
dustin yells at tj
tj ignores him staring straight ahead
the men laugh some more
dustins humiliation sets in
put down the fuckin window
larry goes around to the passengers side broken window and opens the door
he leans in and easily drags tj out of the car
id get out of here kid before he works himself loose
tjs not getting the car back
the men continue laughing at the trapped dustin
tj picks up his bike and rides away defeated
tj sits at the kitchen table with his tiny year old grandma and his depressed and dishevelled dad paul forney
dad has a full shaggy beard and a recently healed wound on his forehead
they eat in silence
theres tension in the air
theres still plenty of applesauce boys
i dont get why what i think doesnt matter
it couldnt stay in the front of the house anymore tj
im not having this conversation again
yeah why not
its there everyday and i have to look at it
when do you look at it
when was the last time you got off the couch
its not healthy
neither are all the pills youre taking but i dont tell you not to take them
i dont wanna talk about it anymore
and thats it
they eat in silence a bit more
tj drops his fork and leaves the table angry
its ok dear
he just needs time
its his first day back tomorrow
lets try and be patient
dad is a mess
one thing at a time dear
one thing at a time
yeah i know mom
grandma nods quietly
tj gives his mouth a once over with a toothbrush
he spits then sets his toothbrush down on the edge of the sink
tj stands holding a banana and wearing a backpack in front of the couch where his dad is sleeping
dad is lying face down half covered with a sheet his leg hanging off the side
theres dirty plates and pill bottles on the coffee table in what is otherwise an old ladys living room
dad stirs its a pathetic sight
tj taps dads leg with his foot
dad slowly comes to life and notices tj
can i have some money so i can buy lunch today
dad sits up on the couch he looks a total mess
dad pick up his wallet from the mess of a coffee table and hands tj a few dollars
hope you have a nice day teej
tj exits leaving dad sitting there
dad sets his wallet back down and stares blankly into the room
we hear the door slam in the background
tj on his bmx pedals down the drive and out onto the street
tj pedals in the middle of a suburban street
he steers his bike with his broken arm as he tries to peel and eat the banana with the other
he glides down a hill
its a long hill
he travels fast
despite the glide and the wind in his hair hes slouching and looks depressed
tj rides his bike through an eerily barren unfinished housing development half built houses and perfectly sealed wide streets
up ahead he can see a small section of unfinished road a big patch of dirt and rocks
he veers up a driveway to avoid it
he passes the dirt patch and then comes down off the curb back onto the road trying to keep control of his bike
he hits the road and loses his balance
the handlebars twist and he crashes onto the road
he jumps up and yelps in pain clutching his elbow
he looks at it
its badly grazed
he yelps again angry
he picks up a rock lying in the street and charges towards an unfinished house
he hurls the rock through its front window
glass crashes down
a silent beat passes and then the front door of the house opens and a late s long greasy haired wiry shirtless guy in filthy black jeans emerges
he has a baby moustache and a cracked front tooth
this is hesher
he makes a determined line toward tj
the fuck you think youre doing
before tj can back away hesher grabs him by the back of his t shirt and drags him kicking and squealing towards the house
hesher drags tj into the unfinished front room
he slams tj against an uncoated drywall
hesher pulls a pair of garden shears from his back pocket and squeezes tjs nose between the blades
tj is terrified
the fuck you think youre doing
you got five seconds or im gonna cut your fuckin nose off
i was just i was just going to school
i i didnt know anyone was here
hesher stares intimidatingly at tj
tj looks seriously scared
youre gonna fuckin hesher is suddenly startled
his ears prick up like a rabbit
he hits the deck dragging tj down with him
their faces are close together
hesher makes a very serious finger to mouth gesture to shhhh
the sound of a car idling outside
tj is on his stomach freaked
tj looks around the room a duffel bag some beer cans a few porn magazines a weathered bass guitar and a sleeping bag
a car door closes loudly
hesher peers through the window and sees a security guard inspecting tjs bike in the front yard and then making his way toward the house
hesher looks at tj with serious and considered venom
you just fucked me
hesher snaps into action
with speed and precision he gathers his stuff together
he shoves it all his duffel bag
whos in there
hesher lights the fuse on a stick of homemade dynamite wrapped in duct tape and throws it through the broken window
he then slips out the back door leaving tj face down on the floor freaked out and confused
what the hell boom
dirt sprays against the house and pours in through the window
tj cowers then hears the guttural roar of a van starting up
he hears the van screech away
get back here
tj jumps to his feet and looks out the window
a dirty black van screams out onto the road and tears away spraying dirt and rocks in its wake
the security guard stumbles around covered in dirt and disoriented
he rushes back to his car and gives chase
tj lets them get away up the street then bolts to the front door
tj darts for his bike
he picks it up and rides off quickly
outside a public high school kids mill around before class
lots of noise
tj rides down a path and clocks dustin howard the kid from the car lot who stands talking with friends by his car a shiny yellow convertible mustang
they spot each other
tj quickly looks away oh shit and b lines for the bike rack
tj opens his locker
he pulls out a clear zip lock bag with a rotten apple inside
he looks at it a moment then puts it back in the locker
a kid puts his hand on tjs shoulder
another kid comes over eating a bagel
welcome back man
tj nods despondent putting books into his backpack
how you feeling man
i came by your house a while ago see if you wanted to come skateboarding or something but it looked like the place was empty
have you moved or something
yeah i tried calling you a bunch of times but it kept saying there was a new number or something
yeah we moved in with my grandma for a little while
oh ok cool
i didnt want to call cause i didnt know
changing the subject you want some of my bagel
tj doesnt want to make chit chat
people are already making him feel weird
hey can i be the first one to sign your cast
ah if you want i guess but im getting it off tomorrow so theres no point really
well welcome back man
yeah welcome back dude
the kids steps away feeling awkward
tj sits in class at the back near the window
the teacher mrs elsberry a big african american lady is taking roll
kids answer as their names are called
tj forneys back
welcome back tj
tj gives a half hearted nod
the class turns to look at him
a couple whisper
tj looks away
the teacher continues taking roll
tj is in gym class another roll call
tj looks up
he notices a guy high up in the bleachers smoking a cigarette and staring at him through long hair
tj looks concerned
is this hesher the guy with the garden shears
tj is walking down the hall
he looks over and sees hesher whos wearing a misfits skull t shirt watching him through the crowd
suddenly tj is grabbed and slammed against a locker
its dustin howard and his posse
dustin towers over him
sup now punk
you dont look so tough now do you
tj attempts to walk away
dustin pushes him against the locker
tj tries to walk away again
leave me alone
how about you suck my cock
dustin slams him again
tj stays put
suck my cock
tj tries to walk
dustin slams him
suck my cock
tj tries to leave again dustin pushes him again
suck my cock
yeah yeah i heard you
suck your cock
then why dont you pull it out
whatd you say bitch
tj tries to walk away
dustin grabs him and throws him down
dont fuckin talk back to me
tj squirms trying to free himself kicking wildly
one of tjs kicks catches dustin
dustin punches him
a crowd quickly gathers
fight fight fight
the school counsellor flips through papers in a file
i know youve been through a lot and its gonna take time to readjust but as you know the school cant tolerate this kind of behavior
im willing to give you the benefit of the doubt this time but you cant be starting fights
i didnt start anything
he pushed me
what he did or didnt do isnt important
whats important is what you do and how you react
do you understand
which part dont you understand
i dont understand the part about how its not important that he pushed me and he punched me and he kicked me and he told me to suck his cock
and now im the bad guy sitting in the office
the counsellor cuts him off
hey hey hey
i do not wanna hear that kind of language in my office
yeah but i didnt listen im gonna cut you some slack but youre gonna have to meet me halfway here
tj shakes his head
he gives up on this conversation
he looks out the window
hesher is out there smoking and watching
tj is suddenly unnerved
i should really be suspending you but i wont if you can promise me youll put in a real effort
noticing tj looking are you listening
its after school
tj walks out to his bike
its the last one left on the rack
only a couple of other kids are still on campus
tj looks around
he jumps on his bike and quickly rides off
tj enters the house which is quiet except for the sounds of a tv
there are no lights on so it feels dark
he walks past the tv room the tv is on
dad is on his back fast asleep mouth wide open
he barely seems alive until he makes a small whimper
his mouth closes he swallows then his mouth drops open again
tj picks up the remote control from a mess of empty pill bottles on the coffee table and switches off the tv
tj walks past the kitchen and drops his backpack
tj walks past his grandmas bedroom
the door is open
he gently knocks
shes sitting up in bed reading
tj stands in the doorway
grandma takes off her glasses
how was your day
pretty much sucked
tj thinks for a moment
i dont know
it just sucked
grandma looks at tj with an empathetic nod
do you want me to turn on the light for you
do i look like im sitting in darkness here
i dont know maybe a little
maybe i need new glasses
she holds her glasses up for closer inspection
actually i dont even know if these are mine
whose are they
geez i dont know
well can you see better with them
jesus i dont know
grandma holds the glasses in different positions
you know my mother always told me that id damage my eyes if i read by poor light and i always think about that when im reading but ive gotten
this far so why am i still worrying about it
why am i even reading
theres something more i need to learn
she give this a moment of thought
i guess theres always something more to learn
she seems almost tickled by this
she slips her bookmark in her book and puts it on her bedside table
is is your dad up yet
why has he been sleeping all day
well you know sometimes people get knocked off course a little when bad things happen
but they come good in the end
tj sits at the kitchen table alone staring at a cute and happy bunny salt and pepper shakers
he can see in through to the tv room where grandma is shaking dad awake on the couch for dinner and holding a glass of milk for him
dad lifts himself off the couch
grandma hands him the glass of milk
heres some milk to wet your whistle
dad shuffles into the kitchen and takes his seat at the table
dad empties a couple of pills into his palm and downs them with milk
tj forks his food around his plate
take some applesauce sweetheart
whats the time
its six oclock
have you been sleeping all day
i just had to lay down for a bit
dad looks up but doesnt seem to notice tjs bruised face
how was school
when are you going back to work
thats a good question
dad scrapes a mouthful onto his fork avoiding the good question
a moment passes
tj stares at him
are you gonna answer it
i dont know
im not ready yet
dads eyes are lowered
he stares at his plate
tj watches him feeling powerless
im not ready yet either
they eat in silence
tj would you please pass me the salt
tj passes the bunny salt shaker
did you know that when albert einstein interviewed people for a job he would take them out for lunch and if they put salt on their food before tasting it
he would not give them the job
grandma looks up at tj with a small grin
she sets the salt shaker down
ive always liked that
tj sits on the bed in a doctors office
the doctor is cutting off his cast with a little buzz saw
the doctor pulls the cast free and inspects tjs arm
it is pale and skinny compared to the other
referring to the smell whoa thats like an eight week old dirty sock
ok so how does that feel
you wanna turn your wrist like this for me
the doctor demonstrates
and like this
the doctor twists his wrist in a different direction
tj does the same
the doctor looks for a pen
any pain or discomfort
i dont know
it feels kinda weird i cant tell
it will feel strange for a few days but should start to feel normal again soon
alright lookin good
i spose i should write you a note for school
the doctor writes the note
while he does so he makes chit chat
hows your dad doing
i dont know
you should probably just ask him yourself
elsberry drones on from the front of the class
if we consider that dreams serve a metaphoric function in narrative fiction as they do in life what metaphoric function would you suggest the dreams here are serving
tj sits in the back of the class by the window
a little pebble hits tjs desk
it bounces onto the floor
tj looks around to find where it came from and then another one hits him in the head
he looks out the window
hesher is right outside the window
he takes the cap off of a large black magic marker
he holds it up to his nose and takes a long slow inhale
he exhales slow and long staring hard at tj
tj looks around confused
hesher recaps the marker throws it hard at tj and wanders off
the marker hits tj then falls to floor near his feet
he reaches for it
elsberry sees this
what are you doing
please pass that forward
tj passes the marker forward
elsberry sets the marker on her desk
you can collect this after class
she continues back to the chalkboard
ok so for our protagonist are these dreams premonitions or desires or even nightmares perhaps
its after school
kids are leaving campus
tj wheels his bike across the school yard
tj rides his bike down the street
dustins yellow mustang appears beside him
dustin is boiling
youre fuckin dead
we see that someone has drawn in big black marker a crude picture of a body sitting on a toilet with a big erect penis
the picture is drawn on the side of dustins mustang door so his real head lines up with the drawing
its drawn in perspective so it looks like dustins head is attached to the naked defecating body to outsiders
the words suck my cock have been scrawled beside the picture
dustin swerves the car toward tj narrowly missing him
tj cuts into a large super market parking lot attempting to get away
dustin accelerates ahead of tj and screeches to a halt in front of him cutting him off almost hitting him
tj stumbles and falls off his bike
his bike lands on top of him
dustin jumps out of his car and starts beating tj in the middle of parking lot traffic
tj struggles just to protect himself cowering on the ground and covering his head
dustin tries to wrestle tj free of the bike so as to get a clearer shot at him
he drags tj by his t shirt ripping it off in the process
and then a womans voice hey
dustin ignores the voice
he continues beating tj
leave him alone
dustin ignores again
i said stop it
dustin ignores one last time a beat passes then the woman nicole mid s appears behind dustin and jumps onto his back bear hugging his face
leave him alone
dustin shakes erratically nicole has a tight grip on him but eventually dustin manages to throw her onto the ground
what the fuck are you doing lady
nicole picks herself up off the ground and holds up her fists like shes ready to fight
she doesnt look very tough
what are you doing
nicole stands defiantly between dustin and tj
dustin looks around at the scene hes created in the street
a man steps out of his car
dustin realizes its time to go
im not finished you fuck
he gets back into his car slams the door and speeds off
nicole watches him go then helps tj up
tj is shirtless scrawny dirty and traumatized
are you alright
i dont know
am i bleeding
i dont think so
i dont know
tj grabs his t shirt and pulls it back on
he picks his bike up off the ground and hops on
he goes to peddle but the chain is busted
his peddling goes nowhere
tj is in the passenger seat
tjs bike is crammed in the back
i cant believe he called me lady
do i look like a lady to you
i dont know i guess
i mean do i look old
well anyway at least i can say ive been in a fight
she thinks about this for a beat
tj is silent
i cant believe he called me lady
tj notices an ice cream cone sitting in a cup holder between the seats
i think your ice creams melting
she tries to pick it up suddenly flustered
it drips everywhere
she doesnt know what to do with it
its too melted to eat
ah fuck it
she throws it out the window
hey so im kinda like a hero now arent i
tj looks over confused
well actually i basically just didnt want to have to go home and then spend the rest of the day feeling bad about the fact that i didnt help you
and then hear about you on the news being beat to death in the parking lot
so you know really im just i did it for me
im just selfish
and im sorry im sorry im like that
tj is silent he has no idea how to respond to this girl
she spots a gas station
oh gas station
she quickly makes an illegal turn into oncoming traffic
cars honk at her
they pull up next to a gas pump
she gets out of the car
you like black or red
ah i dont know black
are you sure
nicole walks off
tj watches her for a beat then his eye wanders over the contents of her messy car
he picks up a white name tag from the coin tray between the seats
it reads ralphs hi my name is nicole how can i help you
tj looks up and sees nicole heading back to the car
he puts the name tag down as the car door opens and nicole gets in
she hands him a stick of red licorice covered in green sugar
red it is
nicole and tj are driving
they eat sour licorice
tjs not enjoying it but not wanting her to know this
its super sour isnt it
you dont have to eat it if you dont like it
its really sour
i know thats the point
i used to hate this crazy sour stuff i dont know what happened
i just recently acquired a taste for it
i dont even really know whats in it but i pretty much eat it all the time
and im sure its making me fat
i just dont want to end up like those fat old ladies you sometimes see you know the really fat ones
tj doesnt know what to make of her
i dont know why im telling you this
anyway i was secretly hoping that you loved these holding up the licorice then taking a bite
so you could eat em for me
but now i can see you dont like em and im kinda glad cuz it means more for me
i guess im sort of a hypocrite in a way
she smiles at that
tj attempts to smile back but hes so confused he ends up making a strange face
he awkwardly looks away
nicoles car pulls up
tj gets out and notices a dirty black van creeping slowly around the corner toward them
this makes him very nervous
ok thanks for the ride
i really appreciate it
he hurries to the door
you want your bike
tj notices his bike still in nicoles back seat
tj rushes back
he drags it out of her car
he wheels it back towards the house
tj goes around the side of the house to the back door
he knocks on the back door
grandma appears at the door
what you doing around the back
grandma lets tj in
tj is nervous
i just i dunno
i was just dumping my bike
tj heads for the living room
your dads gone to the supermarket honey
ah yeah ok
but tj isnt listening
he cant stop thinking about that black van
he exits the kitchen
tj walks the hall carefully to the front door
he squints through the peephole
the black van is parked directly in front of the house
tj cant see properly through the hole
he turns to get a better look through the tv room window
tj turns to the living room
there is hesher standing in the middle of the room with a dirty duffel bag over his shoulder
tj is petrified
they stand looking at each other for a long moment
wheres the laundry room
my dadll be home soon
wheres the laundry room
youve got two seconds to tell me where the laundry room is before i tear your fuckin head off and skull fuck you
tj points to a door off the lounge
its through there
you cant my dads gonna be home soon
hesher stares at him for a second then heads for the door
hesher empties his sack into the washing machine
tj steps into the room wary
hesher ignores him
hesher strips off his t shirt and jeans and add them to the load
hes now standing in the laundry room wearing underwear only
tj sees bad burn scars running down heshers thighs
hesher pours laundry detergent liberally into the machine
what are you doing
you cant hesher turns on a dime and grabs tj by his throat and pins him against the wall
i swear to god
ill cut your face off
he closes the lid
he wrenches the dial around and clicks start
the machine begins a loud cycle
tj follows awkwardly
hesher sits in the middle of the couch and lights a cigarette
you cant smoke in here
hesher drags deep and blows the smoke out in a long whistle straight into the air above him
you cant smoke
hesher flicks his cigarette ashing on the floor
what are you doing
you cant smoke in here
hesher looks at him and ashes on the couch
will you please put it out
can i put it out in your mouth
tj enters the kitchen
grandma is crumbing chicken fillets at the counter
shes listening to loud talk radio
tj goes straight for the cupboards and looks through them
grandma turns eyebrows raised
she turns the radio down
im gonna make a cake
do you remember my cherry cake story
tj gets down on his knees and digs his way through the cupboard while grandma rambles continuing her chicken crumbing
i used to make a cherry cake all the time and it always came out just wonderful
one time i invited my doctor and his wife and i wanted to make an impression
i asked him to come see your dad in a play and he came and i said would you like to come back to the house
tj emerges from the cupboard with a bowl
he turns toward the sink and begins to fill it with water
and he said or his wife said yes theyd like to come back
so earlier that day i made a cherry cake and i used a i didnt know it till afterwards i used a new product instead of crisco i used fluffo
they never made it again that fluffo
grandma can i hear the rest of your story later
im kinda busy
oh of course honey
tj enters carrying the bowl
hesher is on the couch smoking
the tv is now on
he flips channels
tj stands next to hesher
hesher looks at him
the front door opens and dad enters wearing old sweatpants a dirty t shirt and carrying a plastic grocery bag
he stops when he sees the practically naked greasy haired guy smoking on the couch his bed
its a strange moment
tj whos this
after a long uncomfortable silence hesher stands and extends his hand
my names hesher
call me hesher
paul has to rearrange the bags to shake his hand
hesher sits back down
whats he doing
hes doing laundry
they stand looking at each other
tj is just plain stressed out
why is he smoking in the house
i dont know
hesher continues flipping channels
hes not finding anything he wants
did you tell him he cant
how come you only have four channels
hesher gets up off the couch and exits the room
hesher enters the kitchen
grandma is still crumbing chicken
he starts going through drawers right next to her
he doesnt acknowledge her
grandma notices him but not seemingly his cigarette his state of undress or his complete stranger ness
hello old lady
his cigarette is done
he flicks it into the sink
it sizzles out
he opens another drawer
dad enters with his grocery bag
can i help you with something
hesher shuts the drawer
hes holding a fork
nope im good
he exits the kitchen
hesher strides across the back lawn in his underwear
tj and dad step out the door and watch him
hesher reaches a telephone pole and climbs it nimbly like a monkey
at the top he fiddles around with the fork banging and wrenching at the cable box
he drops the fork to the ground and begins his descent
only a couple of feet from the ground he loses his grip and falls crashing down into a thick bush at the base of the pole
tj and dad stand staring frozen
hesher lifts himself up out of the bushes brushes himself off and heads back to the house
he walks right past them and back inside
hesher sits back down on the couch and begins to flip through the newly acquired channels
he finds porn and drops the remote down beside him
he sits back and watches girl on girl action
tj and dad stand just inside the tv room stunned watching the newly acquired porn
then a loud buzz marking the end of the washs cycle sounds from the laundry room
hesher gets up off the couch and heads for it
a stunned and silent bar the porn noise moment later tj follows
dad picks up the remote and switches the tv off
hesher loads his wet laundry into the dryer
so ah what are you doing now
hesher slams the dryer door shut and wrenches the dial around
the dryer starts up loud
hesher pretends he cant hear tj
he turns and looks into the garage which is right off the laundry room
he points inside
this your room
thats the garage
hesher walks into the garage with his bag and slams the door leaving tj standing in the laundry room with the noisy dryer
tj sits at the dinner table with dad and grandma
from the garage we hear a muffled bass guitar playing loud and heavy
does your friend want to eat some dinner dear
hes not hungry
are you sure
yeah im sure
whats he doing in the garage
i dont know
i said he could practice his guitar in there
thats great honey its nice having a bit of music in the house again
is he a new friend
yeah sort of
you know your grandfather played the harmonica for many years
tj doesnt respond
dad looks on perplexed yet disconnected
tj is dressed for school wet hair
he brushes his teeth
we can hear the sound of cartoons in the background
tj stops brushing and listens a second
he hasnt heard cartoons at this hour in a long time
tj enters the tv room
dad is lying on the couch
hesher sits on an armchair eating a bowl of cereal and watching cartoons
tj stands for a beat and watches them
this is strange
tj enters the kitchen
grandma pulls a bottle of orange juice out of the fridge
hesher would you like a glass of orange juice
tj goes to the counter
he pours cereal into a bowl
he grabs the milk carton
he pours it into the bowl but the cartons empty
oh im sorry honey
were out of milk
i can cook you up some eggs if you like dear
i dont have time
tj leans back and looks into the tv room at hesher enjoying his milky cereal
would you like to come for a walk with me today
i cant grandma
i gotta go to school
no i mean later
tj grabs his backpack
i dont know
can you ask me when i get home
the lunch yard is busy
the crowd clears a moment and we find tj sitting on a bench in the shade alone and depressed hidden away from the other kids
he drinks from a can of soda
tj rides his bike into the car lot
tj stands staring at the crashed red volvo from the opening scene that is parked on the lot
he takes a few deep breaths
tj walks up to an open office door and knocks
inside is larry towers
he looks up
i need to talk to you
tj enters and sits opposite
i want to get the car back
yeah i figured that
you made it pretty clear the last time you were here and i thought i made it pretty clear that i couldnt give it to you
what do i need to do to get it back
the cars not for sale
i want to get it back though
how much do you want for it
larry takes a breath
he doesnt want to be having this conversation
he counts the obstacles out on his fingers
i dont know
were talking at least eighteen hundred dollars not including taxes registration adm or dealers fees
on top of that youd need a drivers license
im guessing you dont have one of those
youd need valid car insurance
im guessing you dont have that either
but even if you did have these things i still couldnt sell it to you because the cars not street legal
theres a million reasons why i cant sell it to you
for a second it seems larry feels sympathetic toward tj
look kid i appreciate your enthusiasm i really do but i dont know what to tell you
you cant have the car
end of story
tj churns all this over in his head
larry thinks hes made himself clear
he motions to the papers on his desk
do you mind if i get back to it here
tj walks out of larrys office forlorn
he walks across the showroom head down mumbling angrily to himself
he is stopped by a hand on his chest
youre lucky im at work right now
tj sits on his bike staring at a ralphs supermarket
nicole is at the checkout checking grocery items
she finishes with a customer and tj appears next in line with an ice cream cone
hi sir how are you today
hows it goin
i got you a replacement ice cream
nicole is a little taken aback
oh my god
thats so sweet thanks
tj smiles awkwardly
he hands her the cone
i paid for it over there
he points to the ice cream counter on the other side of the store
she holds the cone not quite sure what to do with it not quite sure how to take this kid
tj walks away
nicole watches him leave while a line of customers wait to be served
she smiles at the next customer sharing the moment
to next customer hi
she starts checking the customers items still holding her melting cone
she looks up out the door
she can see tj outside shaking his head and mumbling to himself
he feels like an idiot
tj enters the house
dad isnt on the couch
he heads for the kitchen
he stops abruptly in the doorway
hesher and grandma are at the counter
grandma is baking an apple pie
hesher is joyfully eating the apple slices she is preparing for the pie
they dont notice tj
and his wife said yes theyd like to come back to the house
so earlier that day i made a cherry cake and i used a new product i didnt know it till afterwards i used fluffo
they never made it again that fluffo
it was an imitation brand
i served the cake and there was silence
and then grandma makes a clicking sound with her tongue on the roof of her mouth
you put the cake in your mouth and it stuck to the roof of your mouth
they could hardly swallow it
hesher finds grandmas story amusing he laughs never losing a beat while eating the delicious apple slices
grandma notices that tj is standing in the doorway
hesher glances over he clearly doesnt give a shit about tj
tj is not impressed with hesher either
tj grandma dad and hesher all sit at the dinner table
they eat in an awkward silence
grandma breaks the ice
so whos coming for a walk with me tomorrow morning
clearly no one is jumping at this opportunity
i cant grandma
i have school tomorrow
ok well youre always invited
the sounds of chewing add to the awkwardness of this dinner
everyone turns toward hesher
this is the first thing to come out of his mouth all night
hes looking at tj
so what school
go on a walk with your grandma
grandma lights up
hes right tj itd be very good for you to get some fresh air
your grandma goes walking in the morning by herself
you cant get your ass outta bed like an hour earlier
she could get raped
dad stops chewing
tj looks at hesher like hes crazy
i read about this shit all the time
grandmas get raped
you ever hear about that guy who killed like old ladies
fuckin google it dude
the granny killer he killed like hella old ladies by strangling them with their dirty panties
taking a mouthful not all of them necessarily got fucked but they all got penetrated by like the dudes fingers and i dont know other shit too
i just think your grandma asks you to go on a walk you should go with her so she doesnt get raped
why would anyone rape me
i dont know they do it grandma
theres some sick fucks out there
everyone continues to eat in silence
tj stares at hesher who is shovelling food into his mouth
tj sits alone in the busy yard nibbling halfheartedly on crackers from his lunch bag
kid from the locker scene earlier appears beside him
what are you doing
come sit with us were in our spot
tj gets up reluctantly then notices hesher walking across the yard towards the bathroom followed by an emo kid with a skateboard
ill meet you there in a second
tj walks off following hesher
kid watches tj walk off toward the bathroom
tj enters the bathroom
he hears voices coming from a back stall
he walks towards them
in the end stall tj finds hesher finishing a drug deal with the emo kid
hesher hands him a bag of pot
the kid hands him money
tj stands and watches
the kid leaves
hesher shoves the money in his pocket ignoring tj
he unzips his fly and turns to urinate in the bowl
what are you doing here
what are you doing at my school
im putting out a fire
tj notices that he isnt actually urinating in the bowl
hes spraying his pee all over the seat and the lid and the wall and the floor
he finishes and zips up
he turns and shoves past tj
hesher looks at his hair in the mirror then exits
tj watches him leave frustrated
he follows him out
tj sees hesher disappear through the crowd
from behind tj is grabbed and dragged back into the bathroom
tj is swung by his backpack across the bathroom
his backpack gets ripped off him and he goes down sliding across the pissy floor
he looks up
its dustin seriously angry
tj leaps up and shoves dustin back
dustin stumbles backwards and trips over tjs bag in the middle of the bathroom floor
dustin falls and lands on his ass
he flounders embarrassingly
tj knows hes a dead man
dustin jumps up and grabs tj by the back of his head
he shoves tjs face down onto the filthy urinal tray
you fucked my car you little prick
dustin holds tjs head down in the tray
he shoves his face into the little yellow urinal deodorizer cake
eat the cake
tj goes to lift himself up
dustin punches him and then stands putting his foot on tjs neck jamming tjs head into the tray
he pushes the flusher
the urinal flushes all over tjs face
fuckin eat it
hesher comes back into the bathroom
dustin turns and looks at him sensing danger
tj looks up from the bathroom floor eyes pleading for help
hesher walks calmly towards tj and dustin
but instead of saving tj he walks straight past them and into the stall where he just completed his drug deal
he grabs his cigarette lighter from the top of toilet tank
he lights a cigarette takes a long drag blows the smoke in the air and walks back out again
dustin watches him go
he puts another boot into tj
its your birthday
eat your fuckin cake
tj waits with his bike in the street outside the school
hes beat up wet and dirty
most kids have already left
dad pulls up in grandmas maroon buick
he gets out and opens the back door for tjs bike
i dont wanna go
itll be good for us teej
well be late
dad takes tjs bike and starts trying to fit it in the backseat
i really dont want to go
i dont think anyone ever wants to go to these things
its supposed to be good for us
thats the whole point
tj stands watching his dad struggle with the bike
give me a hand here
tj and dad sit on beanbags set out in a circle of about
eight of these beanbags have people sitting on them adults and a few kids
some drink tea and coffee from little styrofoam cups
the tone is sombre
dad and tj look unsure of themselves
the chairperson of the meeting is meryl a year old grief counsellor
ok so welcome everyone to the transformational grief group
my name is meryl
we should start off by going around the circle and introducing ourselves and briefly explaining why we are here
hi miss would you please start us off
a heavy set woman coleen and her husband jack sit on beanbags looking pale and sad
we are the bolder family
i am coleen and this is my husband jack
our daughter cynthia was murdered last year
she chokes a bit she was the victim of a violent attack that was unfair and sick
she cant go on
her husband jack sets his hand on her shoulder
she is able to hold back the tears
we are here because we need help
we lost our baby and we are broken
hi my name is jack
as my wife said were here hoping for some answers and just some help with the pain

dad shuffles in his seat looks around the group

and ah i dont know were still trying to come to terms with things and you know just find some guidance of some kind i guess and ah yeah so
dad finishes mid sentence then brief silence
would you like to introduce yourself say a few words to the group
meryl waits to see if tj has anything more to add
to the person next to tj nicholas would you like to introduce yourself to the group
dad and tj pull into the driveway of the forney house
heshers van is parked haphazardly on the lawn
tj looks at it with venom a reminder of the afternoon
tj bursts through the front door
he walks through the tv room to the laundry room
he rips open the door to the garage and flicks on the light
its empty except for a little pile of heshers stuff
he walks back through the living room as dad walks in through the front door closing it behind him
tj heads to the kitchen
tj enters the kitchen
grandma is baking
how was your special group
tj exits the kitchen
he walks the hall to the bathroom
he turns the handle and enters
hesher is having a bubble bath smoking a cigarette totally calm
tj immediately lets rip
you let that fuck stick my head in a toilet and you dont do anything about it
you stand there and fucking watch him do it
hesher ignores tj
he watches him closely
he calmly takes a drag of his cigarette and ashes into the bath
you stay in my grandmas house
youre taking a bath in my fucking grandmas bath
hesher flicks his butt in the bath and pulls the plug
he stays reclined as the water starts gurgling down the drain
hes totally naked
he doesnt care
tj waits for him to say something
hesher steps out of the bath dripping wet naked
tj shoves him
hesher in a flash grabs tj by throat and slams him against the wall
he holds him there for a second staring at him intensely
listen to me
im gonna put some clothes on then youre gonna meet me in my van
hesher lets go of tj and walks out of the bathroom naked
tj and hesher drive through the dark streets of fair oaks
hesher finishes a cigarette
wind blows in his hair
the van rattles
the sex pistols anarchy in the uk is blasting
tj is still angry
where are we going
hesher ignores him
where are we going
after a beat tj turns the music down
touch my stereo again ill seriously fucking hurt you
hesher turns the music back up
tj is confused
hesher drives into a gas station and pulls on the handbrake
he lights another cigarette
what are we doing
hesher gets out of the van and slams the door shut
he goes around the back of the van and opens the back doors
he pulls something out and shuts the doors again
through the side view mirror tj can see hesher filling up a big beat up plastic gas container
he continues to smoke
hesher brings the van to a quiet halt across the street from a suburban house
he kills the engine and surveys the area
tj has no idea where they are
what are we
tj catches himself asking questions but stops himself mid sentence
he looks out the window and across the street and sees dustin howards yellow mustang parked in the drive
what are you doing
hesher smiles to himself hes looking forward to this
he opens the van door and climbs out
tj is in a quiet panic
hesher opens the vans back doors and grabs the container of gasoline
tj appears beside him still panicked
what are you doing
hesher makes his way across the street toward the house and the yellow mustang
he pours gasoline all over the car
he does this with confidence hes clearly had some practice
loud whisper too loud come on
this is insane
lets get out of here
hesher ignores him and continues dousing the car with gas
the porch light comes on
someone peels open the front window curtains and looks out
tj and hesher drop to the ground behind the mustang
tj is terrified
he looks over to hesher who is smiling in his element this is the happiest we have seen him
the curtains close but the porch light stays on
unfazed hesher hops back up and empties the gas can onto the mustang
hesher stands a moment admiring the car saying a silent goodbye to it perhaps as he pulls a single bent cigarette from his pocket
he straightens it then lights it with a match
lets just go
hesher takes one long drag on the cigarette then calmly flicks the still lit match onto the mustang
instantly it erupts in flames
hesher picks up the gas can and walks calmly back to the van
tj follows still franticly looking back at the car and the house
hesher gets in the van and throws the gas can into the back
tj goes to the passenger door
he wrestles the handle panicking
open the door
hesher starts the van and pulls away leaving tj stranded in the street
the front door of the house opens and a woman appears on the porch
discovering the car in flames she screams
tj takes off running across the street and through a neighbors yard down the side of the neighbors house with the woman on the porch screaming at him
hey get back here
he jumps fences and slips down the sides of houses
hes running fast and breathing hard
he finds his way out onto another dark and quiet street
he has no idea where he is or where to go
then headlights appear at the end of the street
they bear down on him slowly
tj stands immobile
he can now see it is heshers van approaching slow and menacing
the van stops about feet from tj
a moments stand off
then hesher sticks his head out the window
you fucking ditched me
get in the van dude
tj doesnt move
hesher revs the engine
hesher revs the engine some more
tj still doesnt move
hesher floors the van
on tj the headlights of the van bear down on him
hesher slams on the brakes and the van screeches to a halt inches from tjs nose
tj doesnt flinch
he and hesher stare at each other through the windshield
tj walks around to the passenger door
tj climbs in the passenger seat of the van
what the fucks wrong with you
whats wrong with you
whats the problem
thats the guy who put you in the toilet
yeah but hesher suddenly freezes looks round motions for tj to shhh
tj looks around everywhere
then hesher lets out a fart
he puts the van in gear and drives
he cranks up the music
tj stares at hesher for a moment then looks straight ahead shaking his head
tj wakes in bed still shell shocked from the previous night
he sits up and rubs his eyes
tj stands at the sink and begins to brush his teeth
he hears the doorbell ring
he hears muffled voices outside
tj exits the bathroom still brushing and walks the hall toward the voices
hesher is standing shirtless in the front doorway eating a banana blocking the view to outside
as tj nears the front door hesher turns and moves away to reveal grandma talking to two uniformed police officers
its for you
hesher disappears back into the house smiling at tj as he passes
are you thomas forney
toothbrush in mouth yeah
wed like to ask you some questions
wed like you to come down to the station with us
whats going on
his dad is now sitting up on the couch blinking in the light
hes in his boxers
his hairs a mess
hes just woken up
hesher emerges from the kitchen heading back to the garage carrying a glass of orange juice
tjs mug shot is taken
tjs fingerprints are taken
tj and his dad sit in an interview room
dad looks confused dopey and dishevelled
a uniformed police officer enters with a file
he shuts the door and sits
ok so were gonna have to let you go now
we may very well be calling on you again very soon but in the meantime let this be a warning to you
regardless of what evidence we do or dont find youve come to our attention today
our attention isnt good
but i didnt do anything
you hearing me here
these are very serious crimes weve been presented with
lets just say someone had been in that car and theyd burned to death
wed be talking about manslaughter possibly murder
have you thought about that
youd be sitting here with detectives from homicide right now
these are felony offences were talking about son
serious jail time offences
tj nods his dad looks on
tjs in the passenger seat
his dad drives
they sit in silence for a little while
then dad speaks did you do it
tj pauses before answering
i didnt do it
what does not really mean
tj ignores him stares out the car window
tell me what not really means
it means i didnt do it
no it doesnt
why would you say not really
i heard you
i said i didnt do it
yeah before that
i asked if you did it
you said not really
i cant remember what i said
why would you do something like that
dad pulls the car into the driveway and comes to an abrupt stop
hesher is sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the driveway sunbathing with his shirt off drinking beer
he has a farmers tan
tj jumps out
dad stares at hesher from inside the car
tj walks past hesher without looking at him
tj enters and slams his door shut
tj sits on his bed
hesher enters without warning
so whatd the pigs want
what the fuck do you think
did they give you a cavity search
did any of the cops put their fingers in your butthole
just fuck off ok
whatd they do
they took my fucking finger prints
i can get into serious trouble
oh is that right
yeah thats right
they dont take this shit lightly
oh they dont
people could have been hurt
if someone was killed it would have been considered murder
hesher feigns concern
thats badass shit
please just leave me alone
ok but first show me your best impression of a dumpling
you know a dumpling the chinese little thingies you eat hesher holds up his thumb and index finger to show the size of a dumpling
tj shakes his head hes not finding this funny
come on like this hesher constricts all the muscles on his face imitating a dumpling he looks ridiculous
tj tries to hold back a smile but hesher looks so absurd he cant
ok your turn
tj shakes his head fighting a smile
and hesher is gone in a flash
tj is hiding peering down an aisle watching nicole working at the check out scanning groceries
a can falls from one of the shelves just in front of him
it startles him
and then another one falls
he steps along the shelf to where the cans fell
he looks through to the next aisle
then a voice from behind him
do you think she is totally bald or do you think shes more of a landing strip kind of chick or more of a s jungle bitch
tj is startled
hesher stands behind him also watching nicole
what are doing here
youre stalking that chick dude
no im not
yeah you are
ive been stalking you for half an hour
you gonna try to fuck her
cant fuck her from here dude
gotta be way closer
shut up about it
you wanna poke her clam
tj is freaked and embarrassed
he walks away down the aisle
you wanna poke her clam or what
please stop saying that
tj walks ahead fast
he wants out of this conversation
nicole finishes up turns her light off and hangs a check stand closed sign
she walks off toward the back of the store
tj stops to be sure to avoid her
you want to poke her clam dude
nothing wrong with that
dont be ashamed about it
humans have been poking vagina for hundreds of years
hesher says this a little too loud
nearby shoppers look over
tj shakes his head then exits the store
bro theres nothing wrong with wanting a little pussy
tj unlocks his bike from a pole
where you going
ill give you a ride
ok but if you come with me itll take minutes and if you ride it will take you about
tj gets onto his bike
come on dude dont be silly lets just car pool
tj clearly doesnt want to ride his bike home but his is reluctant to go with hesher
fine just dont talk to me
i wont say shit
tj and hesher load tjs bike into the back of heshers van
hesher closes the back doors and they get in
look dude im really sorry about the fire the other night he waits a beat for tj to respond
tj is still mad he says nothing
that was totally out of control
foolish and irresponsible actually
tj looks at hesher doubting his sincerity
i want you to have this hesher reaches into the back of the van and picks up a dirty magazine
he flips through some pages and shows tj a photo
tj pushes the magazine away disgusted
get that away from me
dude are you gay
i cant work you out
hesher spots nicole getting into her car
he drops the magazine on tjs lap and fires up the engine
tj spots nicole
hey what are you doing
hesher puts the car in gear and begins to follow nicoles car out of the parking lot
stop the car i want to get out
tj opens the door
hesher grabs his arm
you get out of this van ill rip your dick off and fuck her for you
hesher means business
tj is silent and back on edge
nicole drives through the parking lot
hesher follows her out of the lot and into the street
hesher bobs his head in time with a heavy metal track that blasts from the stereo
tj is ignoring hesher looking straight ahead at nicoles car
nicole stops at a red light behind another car
hesher pulls up behind her and starts playing air drums to the track
the light turns green
nicole hits the gas running straight into the back of the car in front which hadnt started moving yet
tjs first impulse is to duck
hesher watches the road
we hear the sounds of an angry driver yelling at nicole
through the windscreen we see the guy get out of his car yelling at nicole
nicole is flustered and begins to cry
the driver is inspecting the smashed rear end of his car
you just messed up the back of my car you stupid idiot
you need to pay attention when youre driving a fucking car i think i can help here
hesher is out of the van approaching on foot smoking
i saw the whole thing
the chick here was stopped and you reversed right into her
i dont know what your fucking problem is dude
why would you just reverse into her
thats fuckin retarded
what are you talking about
tj lifts himself up again to see whats going on
he sits low concealing himself and watches the altercation in the street
hesher and the driver face off
the driver is simultaneously bewildered and angry
are you out of your mind
you better start making like youre gonna pay her for the damage
i didnt back into her
i dont know what youre talking about
hesher rips his shirt off aggressively
you calling me a fucking liar dude
the guy immediately begins backing down
no i i im just saying i dont know whats going on here
youre calling me a fucking liar is whats going on here
hesher pushes the guy hard
look i dont want any trouble sir
fight me cocksucker
hesher is seriously amping up the street agro
the guy doesnt know what to do
he starts heading back to his car
this is ridiculous come back here and find out how ridiculous it is
the guy gets in his car and speeds away leaving hesher shirtless and nicole in the street
hesher stubs his cigarette now totally relaxed again
see you later
hesher heads back to the van
nicole watches him not exactly sure what to say
hesher climbs back into his van
hesher slams the van door
tj is slouched way down in his chair out of sight
hesher gets in and looks ahead
nicoles car sputters and steam pours from under the hood
come on man lets just go
your sexy girlfriends in trouble
were not going anywhere
hesher gets out
he cant see whats going on
long seconds pass
and then his door opens
hesher is standing there next to nicole
you know tj
this is now beyond embarrassing for tj
he cant even think straight
tj and hesher push nicoles car off to the side of the road
nicoles in the passenger seat shaken by the turn her day has taken
tj is in the back
sometimes you know a day is bad and then when you think it couldnt get any worse you suddenly discover whole new ways it can get worse
hesher reaches over her and pulls a joint from the glove compartment
he lights the joint and takes a big toke
he offers it to nicole
hesher shrugs and takes another big toke then offers it to tj who also declines
this one time i had like four hella drunk chicks in the back of the van and we were going for it and i had one hand on this one
girls tit and my other hand on this other chicks twat but there was like still two other girls wanting to get off so like i had my foot rubbing on one girls asshole while im trying to eat the other girl out and i was going crazy man
it was too much
i couldnt work out which chick was which and im making one girl cum but then im forgetting about the others and my tongues hurting and my fingers are getting
tired and like eventually i was just like fuck this
this is too much and i just stepped back
i just stepped back
and before you know it these girls are all working on each other you know
theyre all fingering each other and eating each other out you know and i jerk myself off and everyones a winner you know
nicole looks at hesher like hes crazy
tj is in the back he cant believe whats coming out of heshers mouth
a moment passes
was that some kind of perverted metaphor for me
about how i should just step back and let things work themselves out
he reaches for the stereo and cranks the knob metallicas motorbreath blasts through the speakers
as if he were possessed by the music hesher veers dangerously off the road onto a dirt patch
he has a crazed look in his eyes
tj and nicole grab onto anything they can hold onto
hesher turns the wheel hard and floors the gas
the van spins in circles spraying dirt in every direction
tj gets thrown from the back seat onto the ground
dirt pours into the windows and covers them from head to toe
hesher corrects the wheel and veers back onto the road again
he turns the knob on the radio to an easy listening station
ub s red red wine plays
a car honks as an angry driver passes
what the hell was that
hesher looks over at nicole
i saw a mouse
tj picks himself up off the vans floor dusting himself off
are you ok
i have dirt in my mouth
tj scrapes his tongue with his fingers
nicole breaks a little smile
the black van pulls up curb side outside a neat suburban home
hesher gets out and walks covered in dirt to the front door of the house
he looks in through the window knocks waits
an old man opens the door
they exchange a few words
hesher heads back to the van and they drive off
nicole and tj seem confused
whos that guy
hesher says nothing
they drive three houses down the street and stop again
hesher gets out
again he peers in the window knocks on the door
this time no answer
he heads back to the van
nicole and tj watch him approach from inside
he sticks his head in
come on lets go
my uncles house
hesher walks off toward the side gate of the house
nicole and tj climb out of the van and follow hesher
nicole seems cautious
tj knows hes on an adventure
hesher jumps the side gate then opens it for the others
what was that back there
what was what
that other house
in the backyard is a swimming pool
nicole and tj stand looking in the pool
its a nice pool with a diving board
hesher walks up behind them and pushes them in
nicole comes up for air
what the fuck
yeah and now im wet
hesher smiles wide
youre dirty and wet
im coming in
he throws his t shirt off and does a huge bomb into the pool
now im dirty and wet too
he splashes water at her
he dives under the water
suddenly tj is pulled under
nicole cant see them under all the motion
then tj and hesher come bursting up for air
cut it out
shut down all the fucken trash compactors on the detention level
hesher dives under the water again
hesher has her leg
he doesnt drag her under
he just tugs her leg
she slaps at the water
he tugs her leg again
pretty soon shes laughing
heshers head appears above water momentarily
all the fucking trash compactors
underwater then up again on the detention level
he dives again
he pulls her leg
she laughs hard
tj watches feeling a little left out
hesher jumps up and climbs out of the pool
he goes to a garden table nearby
more trash coming in
he heaves the table over and into the pool
he grabs a banana lounge
he throws it in the pool
nicole and tj have to dive out of the way
they go to the sides of the pool and climb out laughing while hesher continues heaving garden furniture a barbecue and anything else in reach into the water
tj and nicole sit on the edge of the pool with their legs dangling in the water
theyre fully clothed and soaking wet
he walks off around the side of the house looking for more things to break
there is an awkward silent moment between tj and nicole
tj looks down and notices a small army of ants marching along the side of the pool
he manages to get one to crawl onto the his finger
so how do you know this guy
i dont know hes sort of moved into my grandmas house with us
what like hes renting a room or something
no not really i dont know its kinda a long story
tj flicks the ant off of his finger then another one thats climbing up his arm
do you realize that the equivalent to you flicking that ant would be like one of us getting hit in the face by a giant wrecking ball at miles an
hour and getting thrown into the next yard
tj stops mid ant flicking
do you think the other ants are gonna wonder where that ants gone
do you think their gonna miss her
tj doesnt know how to answer
hesher reappears with a container of lighter fluid and goes to the diving board
he climbs on and squirts the lighter fluid through his lighter sending streams of flames into the pool
hesher douses the diving board with lighter fluid and ignites it with his lighter
the diving board erupts into flames
jump in the fi re
hesher takes a few steps back then runs toward the board
he springs through the flames into the air
he does a messy sideways flip
he lands in the pool splashing tj and nicole
he pulls himself out and shakes his hair around like a wet dog
he looks over at the flaming diving board
shit look at that
hesher grabs his shirt on his way toward the fence
he doesnt look back
i got a doctors appointment
hesher hops over the fence
it burns when i urinate
hesher disappears over the fence
we hear his van start and peel away
the flaming diving board pours black toxic smoke into the sky as it crumbles into the pool
did he just leave us
i think we should get out of here
nicole stands and heads for the gate tj tags behind
they jump the side fence and head out into the street dripping wet
tj nicole walk over the crest of a small hill on a tree lined street eating ice cream cones
they walk in the middle of the road still damp
the sun is setting
the light is magical
my shoes are so squishy
tj steps hard squirting water out the sides of his wet shoes
so whats his name
is that a name
i dont know
does he have a last name
i dont know
how old is he
i dont know
do you know anything about him
that was so lucky you guys were behind me when that guy got all mad about his car
i was freaking out
i dont really have any insurance right now
i just cant afford it
theres no way i could afford to fix that guys car
how do people do this stuff
i mean i have a job
its kind of a joke though
ive been there for like a year and im still only doing like five hours a week
why arent they giving me any more hours
do you think its because they think i suck
did you think i sucked when i served you at the checkout
i dont even get paid enough to really cover my rent
im gonna have to start selling shit pretty soon
tj licks his ice cream then reaches into his pocket
here i got two bucks
the sad thing is i could actually use it
a parking ticket sits under the wiper on nicoles windshield
tj and nicole approach the car smiling and then nicole sees the ticket
her face sinks immediately
please tell me thats not a ticket
she runs the last few steps to the car and rips the ticket from under the wiper
she reads it quick
fuck fuck fuck it
she paces a couple of angry circles and then kicks the cars tire
it hurts her foot
in a small frenzy she pulls her keys from her pocket and opens the car door
she gets in and slams the door behind her
she sits behind the wheel and yells frustrated
tj stands in the street uncomfortable not knowing what to do
he goes to the car and gets in beside her
he sits still not knowing what to say
she tries to settle herself but shes still very emotional
what have i done to deserve this chain reaction of shit all the time
sometimes i wonder if i were to die right now if anyone would care or even notice
she lets out a small disbelieving laugh
thats nice of you to say but i doubt it
if you died right now
tj thinks a moment
its a sweet and sour moment
he wants to cheer nicole up but hes remembering his mom at the same time
mainly because id be sitting in a car with a dead lady
nicole sniffs smiling through her tears
please dont call me lady
she smiles warmly at tj
lets get out of here
she puts the key in the ignition and turns it
nicole takes a breath not wanting to get upset again
she turns to tj and smiles sadly
you wanna steer or push
tj enters the house he leaves his wet shoes and socks at the door
he enters the kitchen
hesher sits at the table waiting for his dinner
grandma is serving food onto plates
hesher is smiling
so did you fuck her
dad enters tying the drawstring on his track pants
he looks messy as ever
where were you today
counselling im there by myself
yeah thats real nice
this thing is for you just as much as it is for me
i waited outside school for minutes

maybe you should let me know before you dont show up next time
i told you i didnt want to go
i told you a hundred times
no you didnt
yes i did
youre just not listening
no you didnt
what you told me was that you didnt want to go
you didnt tell me that you were just not going to show up
what difference does it make
for me a big difference
it means im sitting on a fucking beanbag in a room full of losers by myself
grandma sets more food on the table
boys please im not feeling well
grandma heads back to the kitchen to grab more food
there is silence at the table
can you pass me my pills
hesher slides dads pill bottle over
hesher puts his finger into the mashed potatoes and wiggles it around
discreetly to tj did you finger her twat
shut the fuck up
hesher licks the potatoes off his finger
i dont wanna hear it
did you hear what he just said
i dont care
if i hear it again youre going to your room
you gonna start punishing me now
maybe i need to
if its not the language then its your lack of responsibility
or im having to escort you down to the police station
im really sorry you had your ass dragged off the couch
im sorry you had to put some fucking underpants on for the first time in months
tj sits and fumes nostrils flaring
oh what soon as im right thats enough
i dont want to hear one more word from you
tj sweeps his plate off the table
it goes crashing onto the kitchen floor food everywhere
grandma walks back into the room looking worried
hesher seems riveted like hes watching the tennis
and then dad sweeps his plate off the table
crash food mess
he glares back at tj
that make you feel better
tj wrenches his chair back and storms off
dad sits a moment
with tj gone his reproach turns to shame
grandma and hesher make eye contact with each other
dad gets up and leaves the kitchen
hesher shovels some more food into his mouth
grandma looks concerned
did i miss something
paul came in and said some dumb shit which tj got angry about and so tj smashed his plate and then paul smashed his plate too but i got a
feeling he smashed his one cuz he couldnt actually think of anything to say cuz he kinda knew tj had a point and so now he feels bad about it and so hes gone somewhere
takes another mouthful i dont know where
grandma contemplates this
those boys have been through a lot
this makes grandma very sad
sometimes i wonder if theyre ever gonna smile again tears well in grandmas eyes
grandma is quietly crying
i just wish there was something more i could do
a long beat passes
hesher doesnt know what to say
he pours applesauce on his food
grandma looks around the kitchen at the mess
she shakes her head takes a deep breath and starts cleaning up
she picks up bits of broken plate and takes them to the sink
hesher watches her
this is delicious
thank you dear
hesher holds up a piece of bacon covered in applesauce and licks off the sauce
whats green and slimy and smells like bacon
i dont know dear
whats green and slimy and smells like bacon
i dont know
im going to lie down
im not feeling well
im very nauseated
hesher finishes the last few bites of his dinner
he notices dads pill bottle
he reaches for them
he unscrews the lid and empties a few into his hand
he swallows the pills
grandma lies in bed on top of her covers
hesher enters the doorway and knocks lightly
did you figure it out yet
figure what out dear
whats green and slimy and smells like bacon
no not yet dear
can you do me a favor
will you please hand me that red tin on the cabinet dear
hesher enters the room grabs the tin from on top of the cabinet and hands it to grandma on the bed
kermit the frogs finger
think about it
grandma opens her red tin and takes out what looks like a rolled cigarette
woah whats that
oh im feeling very nauseated
theyre medical cigarettes that help me with the nausea
will you light a match for me dear
hang on a second
can i see that
hesher sniffs the cigarette
hesher sets the cigarette down
ill be right back
hesher dashes out of grandmas room
after a few moments he comes back and sits on the edge of the bed
he is holding a glass bong
the bong has so much resin caked onto the sides it looks as though a thousand pounds of marijuana have been smoked through it
hesher takes one of grandmas medical joints and breaks it in half and loads the bowl of the pipe
what is that
its a bong
the water filters the smoke
its probably the most healthy way to smoke weed
hesher lights up and takes a huge hit from the bong
he explains his technique to grandma while holding the smoke in
ok so basically cover the hole here with your thumb then suck on the top and once the chamber fills with smoke take your finger off the hole and suck
hesher takes a quick sip of air sucking the smoke deeper into his lungs
then try and hold the smoke in for as long as possible ok bro
grandma takes the bong and has a hit
its a bit clunky but she manages to make it work
ok lift your finger
hesher helps her
the smoke shoots into her lungs
grandma begins to cough
that was a big one
yeah that was good
hit it again
grandma has another hit
it goes well
she blows out the smoke
hesher takes the bong off her and has another huge one for himself
he passes the bong back
i think im ok dear
hesher takes the last hit
he dusts off the bowl and sets the water pipe down
they sit for a moment and let the drug sink in
honey how old are you
who wants to know
i dont know
you seem a little older than tj
oh stop it
arent you a little old to be hanging around tj all the time
no im his grandmother
yeah i guess you have a point
ok well i used to have a mouse
hang on a minute
i used to have a snake
and do you know what snakes eat
actually theres no limit to the food items that you can even think of that a snake might eat
whatever is available in abundance would become the prey for the snakes
depending on their growth their diet hesher cuts her off
yeah ok ok well actually they eat mice
they do eat mice
a lot of times snakes eat other snakes because theyre the right shape yeah ok well anyway
i used to have a snake and i fed it mice
but one time i fed this little fuckin mouse to my snake and that mouse was tough
i dropped that mouse in the snakes tank and the snake wouldnt go near him and any time he tried that mouse would just smack him with his little you
hesher looks at his hand not knowing what mouse hands are called
with his little mouse hand
so instead of eating the mouse the snake just curled up crying in the corner and the mouse ruled that fuckin cage
and this went on for weeks the snake wouldnt go near him
that tiny mouse used to sit in a little miniature lawn chair scratching his balls and shelling peanuts and this snake was just too scared to go near it
and cuz the snake was scared of that mouse i had to feed him other mice but every time i dropped another mouse in the tank itd hide behind the
and so eventually the snake starved to death
i had a cage full of mice
grandma is stoned and sleepy and fading out
so is tj the mouse
maybe he is
well then what am i
youre an old lady
no im a grandmother
yes you are
and you know what grandmother
im gonna go on a walk with you in the morning
oh thats nice
where are you going
im not going anywhere
im going with you
around the block i guess
oh ok well have a nice time
ill see you when you get back
no im going with you
ohh ok caauuse iii
grandma has fallen asleep but mumbles like she is continuing the conversation
hesher smiles to himself turns off her lamp and exits the room
he stands over whats left of the mess on the kitchen floor
he lights up a cigarette off the stoves flame and takes a long slow drag as he crouches down and starts picking up pieces of broken plate from the pile
dad is asleep on the couch
a single shaft of bright sunlight lands on his face causing him to stir
tj nimbly reaches down to the table covered with dirty dishes and pill bottles and quietly picks up his dads wallet
he removes an atm card and places the wallet back where it was
close on an atm card sliding into the slot
fingers type numbers
a small stack of twenty dollar bills pours out
tj puts the money in a dirty envelope pockets it and rides off on his bike
tj walks through the showroom to larrys office
larry is on the phone
tj stands and waits
larry watches him
the kid isnt going anywhere
yeah why dont you just have him send them over
scott can you hold on a minute
what do you want

tj takes a seat outside the office
larry closes the door
dustin howard appears
the fuck are you doing here
i came to talk to him
its none of your business
what do you wanna talk to him about
tj ignores him
dustin taps tjs leg with his foot
what do you want to talk about

larrys door opens
larry emerges from his office
i got the money
the money for the car
what money for the car

larry steps back into his office and shuts the door
wheres it gone
and what makes you think im gonna tell you
tj stares angry
an awkward moment passes
he storms away dragging a water cooler down as he leaves
it crashes onto the ground
water spills everywhere
tj angrily winds his way toward the back of the lot
he stops at the spot where his moms car once was now just an empty space
hesher is pouring himself a bowl of captain crunch berries
he pours milk onto the cereal
he does a half hearted side to side stretch getting ready for his walk
he looks out the window gray clouds suggest rain
he takes the bowl with him out of the kitchen
hesher walks the hall eating his bowl of crunch berries
he stops at grandmas door and looks in
he stops eating and stands strangely still for a moment
inside we see grandmas feet sticking out from behind the bed where she lies face down on the ground
hesher enters the room cautiously
he stands at the end of the bed
he sets his cereal bowl down bends and shakes her
he shakes her again this time a little harder
he stands up looking at her still body
as he realizes she is not waking up his breath becomes fast fighting hard not to get emotional
gray clouds fill the sky
we hear distant thunder
on his bike tj coasts down the hill of a tree lined street
hes upset and trying hard to hold it back
tj drops his bike and enters the house
dad sits on the couch his head in his hands
he looks up
hesher enters the room
he punches a hold in the wall
he paces angrily back forth
dad holding back tears gets up off the coach and hugs tj
whats going on
grandma shes not
shes not waking up
she wont wake up
short fast heavy breathing sets in
what do you mean
tj runs over to grandmas room and stops at the door
he disappears into the room for a second then emerges again in tears his hands on his face
he heads back to the living room
i dont know she just she just didnt wake up
tj is in shock
he sits on the couch next to dad
they are both lost for words
hesher stands in the corner with his head shoved between the walls
hesher joins tj and dad on the couch
they are all raging inside confused lost and upset
they sit together in silence for a long beat in the same boat for the first time
hesher breaks the silence
he kicks the table over as he stands
i gotta get the fuck out of here before i hurt someone
he leaves through the front door leaving it open behind him
tj gets up in a daze and stands at the doorway looking out
it has started to drizzle
tj stands in the doorway working up the nerve to enter
he enters and leans down to grandma and tries to lift her onto the bed
she is heavy for him he struggles
he gets her on top of the bed and looks at her for a moment
tj breaks into tears
he leans down onto the bed holding grandma crying into her chest
tj sits on his bed and looks inside the envelope of cash
he closes it and seals it shut
on the front he writes nicoles close on a small piece of paper with a hand written number
the numbers are dialed on a phone
tj waits while the phone rings
hi its nicole
im not in right now but leave a message and ill call you back
its tj here
i ah im sorry to bug you but um i dont know i guess i wanted to talk to you right now
i dont know
i have a present for you too so maybe ill just come drop it off or something or ah yeah
he hangs up the phone and exits
tj walks out the front door
dad is quietly sitting on the front steps wearing a t shirt in the light rain
tj goes to his bike
what are you doing
i dont know
getting some fresh air i guess
its starting to rain
dad reaches out his hand and catches a few drops
tj picks up his bike and rides
we stay with dad as tj disappears down the wet street
tj rides his bike
he rounds a corner onto nicoles street
he jumps off his bike outside her building and wheels it inside the front fence
tj climbs the stairs of nicoles building
as he approaches her apartment door he hears loud but muffled music
he knocks on the door
the music is really loud
he knocks again
he tries the door handle
he pushes the door open tentatively
tj enters the apartment
the music is blasting
he looks around the living area
clothes are strewn around
he sees heshers combat boots t shirt jeans
tj looks seriously troubled
we can faintly hear heavy breathing moaning coming from the bedroom
tj walks over to a door
its an inch ajar
he pushes it open gently
we dont see what he sees but tj stands deathly still eyes wide white as a ghost
we hear nicole giggle
then oh shit
tj storms away heading for the front door
he pulls a lamp smashing to the ground on his way out
tj charges down the stairs
he grabs his bike and heads out into the street
light rain falls
we see hesher appear behind him barefoot and topless buttoning his jeans
tj notices heshers van parked out the front he drops his bike and grabs a rusty pipe from a pile of garbage on the sidewalk and heads straight toward the
tj takes a hard swing into the van smashing the tail light
nicole runs out into the street concerned wearing an oversized sweatshirt and underpants
the fuck are you doing
tj ignores him and takes another swing at the van
hesher approaches tj
tj takes a swing at him with the pipe
hesher steps back
nicole gasps her hand to her mouth
she doesnt know what to say or do
fuck you fuck you fuck you
stop hitting my van
and youre a fucking whore
i hope you die
and when you do no ones gonna fuckin notice
cuz youre a fat fucking prostitute
hesher steps toward tj
dude chill out for a second
tj swings the pipe at hesher again
get the fuck away from me
ill smash you in the face i swear to god
back the fuck up
tj swings again
hes so angry hes practically foaming at the mouth
i never want to see you or your ugly fucking face again
that goes for both of you fucking assholes
tj throws the pipe at hesher
it hits the road with a loud clang
tj grabs his bike and rides away furiously
hesher and nicole watch tj ride away
it begins to rain hard
tj glides his bike down a long hill in the pouring rain in tears
tj rides up the front porch
a funeral home truck is parked out the front happy ever after is written on the side
tj drops his bike and enters the house
dad sits at the dining room table with a funeral director a tall lanky man
he talks in a drawn soft monotone
dad doesnt appear to be at all in the mood for this conversation
after the service we have complimentary lemonade in our wake room but should you wish to upgrade to soda and sandwiches we can arrange that
people typically like to have a light bite after the service
the front door slams
tj storms past the dining room table
the funeral director pauses and watches him pass
the sound of tjs bedroom door slamming shakes the house
tj is angrily pacing back and forth
a gentle knock reveals dad at his door
are you ok
tj refuses to look at his dad
will you just leave me alone
dad doesnt know what to say beyond this
he feels as lost as tj does
he leaves the room
he enters the garage violently
tj sweeps heshers belongings off the work bench in the garage
he kicks heshers sleeping bag and pillow
a weathered bass guitar leans against a little amplifier
tj kicks the guitar snapping it in two
out of breath he stands in the mess he has created
something catches his eye
he contemplates this for a beat
close on garden shears
tj pockets them and exits the garage
tj heads straight toward the front door of the house
its raining hard
tj storms out just as hesher is making his way up the path his van parked on the street behind him
hesher reaches out his arm to slow tj
i wanna talk to you
tj pushes heshers arm out of the way
get your fucking hands away from me
i told you i never want to see you again
hesher at a loss watches tj grab a brick from the muddy garden and throw it through the passenger side window of his van
hesher charges tj
he throws him into the muddy garden and kneels over him holding him by the collar of his hooded sweatshirt
i fuckin told you leave my van out of this
hesher lifts tj up and slams him back down on the ground knocking the wind out of him
tj struggles to get away
let go of me
fuckin let go of me
dad runs out the front door and pulls hesher off tj by the back of his shirt
what in gods name hesher shakes free from dads grip and punches him square in the nose
dad goes down hard
dont fuckin touch m
without hesitation tj jumps on heshers back bear hugging his face
they struggle for a beat until hesher manages to throw tj off
he lands on the wet grass like a ragdoll
fuck you both
hesher stands breathing hard dripping wet from the rain fists clenched
he turns back to his van gets in slams the door and peels away
tj picks himself up out of the mud grabs his bike and rides off in the opposite direction
dad stands holding his bloody nose
he watches hesher he watches tj
he is left confused and bleeding in the pouring rain
its raining cats and dogs
tj stands outside dustins house soaking wet with his hoodie pulled over his head the garden shears in his hand
he walks around the side of the house and looks in the window
from tjs pov outside we see dustin in the kitchen preparing a sandwich one eye on the tv
he takes the sandwich to the couch in front of the tv and lies down
tj walks around the back of the house
he tries the handle to the back door
tj sees the dog door
he climbs through the flap trying to be as quiet as possible
the tv is loud inside
tj treads softly through the kitchen soaking wet shears poised
he walks through to the living area
he steps behind the couch out of dustins line of sight
dustins bare feet hang off the end of the couch
tj ducks down
he opens the shears and carefully brings them down over dustins big toe
he squeezes them shut
wheres my car
what are you doing
wheres my fucking car
are you crazy
you make me ask one more time your toes coming off
i swear to god
its gone to the wreckers
the wrecking yard
tj squeezes a little harder
dustin squeals a little louder
why would i be lying
because youre a fucking asshole
tell me where it is
its gone to the wreckers
i swear to god
tj squeezes harder
im not lying
it went to the wrecking yard on sunrise near red bridge yesterday afternoon
its there now
tj thinks holding dustins toe in his grip
i swear to god man
its at the wrecking yard on sunrise
if youre lying im gonna cut off every one of your fingers
tj doesnt quite know what to do now
he stares at dustin who looks genuinely frightened
tj releases the shears and backs away
and the second he does so dustin leaps off the couch grabs tj by the throat and slams him down on the living room floor
tj drops the shears
want to tell me something else while youre visiting
dustin wails into tj
tj cowers on the ground
punches land a lawn chair comes crashing through the front window into the living room raining glass everywhere
dustin stops punching stunned and looks up to see hesher dripping wet step through the big nasty hole he has just made
what the fuck
dustin moves to stand
hesher pounces on him dragging him along the ground
he grabs the shears and brings them straight up to dustins nose
in the same movement he snaps the shears shut and takes the end of dustins nose off
dustin squeals in pain and scurries backwards clutching his face blood leaking between his fingers
tj stands stunned
what the fuck is wrong with you
oh my god my nose
what the fuck is wrong with you
i just saved you
you cut his nose off
only a bit its just a cut
dustin is crying now clutching his face
tj goes to the kitchen
you just cut his nose off
what are you talking about
tj runs a rag under the tap and takes it to dustin
hesher stands clutching the shears confused
hold this against your face
hesher is still confused
you gotta stop the bleeding
oh my god
whats your problem
dustin holds the rag
tj stands to face hesher
i want you outta my life
i never want to see you again
how many times do i have say it
they look at each other a moment
hesher looks taken aback
he honestly believed he was doing a good thing
tj leaves through the front door
hesher stands over a whimpering dustin wondering what went wrong
tj rides his bike over a rickety red bridge
he pulls his bike up outside the tall wire fence of a big dirty wrecking yard d s auto wreckers
its still raining very hard
tj is soaking wet
he sits on his bike looking at mountains of wrecked cars inside
tj hops off his bike and shoves it behind a dumpster
he gets up on the dumpster and climbs the wrecking yards fence
tj roams the stacks looking for his mothers car
he looks distraught
all around sit stacks of wrecked cars
a vicious dog on a chain barks and snarls nearby
he sees his moms car atop a tall stack of wrecks
he looks at it a moment contemplating what to do
he moves to the base of the stack and begins to climb
he clambers slowly up the pile in the rain
its awkward and difficult and more than a little dangerous
finally he reaches the top
he wrenches open the car door and squeezes behind the wheel
tj sits catching his breath
the rain clatters on the roof of the car
tj is up high enough to see the lights of the surrounding neighborhood
he sits and contemplates the last few days and months of his life
he closes his eyes
a doorbell rings
tj runs to the door wearing the bottom half a suit
its the pizza man
yells into house pizzas here i need money
dad clean shaven dressed in a suit comes to the door and pays
yells into the house ok pizzas here
alright lets do it
the woman comes down the stairs with her hair nicely done wearing a fancy pink dress its tjs mom
teej cmon sweetheart
we have to go
were going to be late
what about the pizza
well eat it in the car
she begins to do up tjs tie
honey will you grab the present
dad picks up a large box off the side table its clearly heavy
holy crap what is this thing
the three emerge from the house
tj is wearing a suit and carrying the pizza box dads carrying the heavy present and moms carrying a bouquet of flowers and her purse
dad stands at the door of a little white car
clearly the box is too big
ah slight problem
mom open the back of her red volvo which is parked right next to the white car
well take my car
dad does a heel spins around the white car and heads towards moms red volvo never losing a beat
dads driving eating a slice of pizza
tj is in the backseat looking out the window also eating pizza
mom does her make up in the visor mirror
i think we should keep the new one and give them our old one
thats a great idea
ill be sure to let them know that our dirty old microwave is a gift from you
im not even sure they know who i am
honey theyre my friends
ok i just dont understand why they get so many presents
a microwave and a bottle of scotch is hardly a lot of presents
mom half laughs and shakes her head
mouth full of pizza mom can you turn on the radio
how about some oldies
oldies but goodies
mom turns on the oldies station
dion and the belmonts a teenager in love plays
dad sings along
the car hits a bump
mom smudges her lipstick
she turns to dad and we can see her lipstick has gone up onto her cheek
she smiles at dad
they all smile at this then from out of nowhere the car is t boned on the passengers side
the impact is massive
the noise is deafening
the car spins into the oncoming traffic and is hit by a delivery truck
the car flips
more deafening noise
tj wakes in the wrecked car at the wrecking yard
the loud sound of crunching metal continues
tj is startled and disoriented
he realizes the car is moving
a crane is lifting the car with a huge wrecking yard magnet
as it rises off the stack it dangles at a precarious angle
tj is thrown through the car to be wedged up against the windshield
he squirms his way to the window and waves his arm wildly outside yelling trying to get the attention of the guys below
the car shifts violently and tj slides out through the window
tj is hanging dangerously out of the car swinging his legs and screaming at the top of his lungs
his voice can barely be heard over the sound of machinery
a guy on the ground mario looks up and spots tj
he frantically looks to get the crane operators attention
kill it man
ricky sticks his head out of the crane cab like he cant hear
theres someone in the car
ricky looks up
both men can see tj dangling
as the car is lowered tj jumps the last few feet to the ground
mario leads him away from the car and the crane
what the hell are you doing
i dont know
what were you doing in there
i dont know
this cars about to get crushed
if i didnt see you you would be dead
what were you thinking man
tj doesnt respond he backs away
mario watches him walk away still disbelieving
he turns back to ricky and gives him the all clear to start her up again
tj walks to the entrance gate while behind him his moms car is hoisted high in the air
tj stops at a dirty vending machine by the gate
he pulls coins from his pocket and slots them in
it spits out a chocolate bar
moments later tj stands with his half eaten chocolate bar while watching his moms car get fed into a giant crushing machine and compacted into scrap
tears well in his eyes
he feels helpless
tj walks in the front door
dad jumps up from the couch
he has a bandage on his nose and a black eye
he looks distraught like hes been up all night
where have you been
where have you been
i lost track of time
you lost track of time
its ten in the morning
ive been up all night
how is that fair to me
i dont know
dad looks at him breathing hard
tears well in his eyes
dad starts crying hes falling to bits
just go to your room
dad knows hes being pathetic
tj walks off down the hall
tj stands in front of a mirror trying to correctly tie his neck tie
he makes a sad attempt and leaves it it looks wrong
theres a knock at tjs bedroom door but the door doesnt open
theres someone at the front door for you
nicole stands at the door
tj is unimpressed with seeing her
he stands in the doorway looking silly with his tie
heshers not here
i came to see you
what do you want
i wanted to tell you something
tj stares at her
i didnt know if i should come here or not but i couldnt stop thinking about it
i thought maybe if i came youd still just be really angry at me and hate me but then i thought if i didnt youd think i didnt care and
youd hate me anyway so i figured i might as well come just in case so here i am
yeah well what do you want
i want to apologize
i feel bad about what happened
i didnt take your feelings into consideration yeah well whatever
it doesnt really matter
i have to go
yes it does
it does to me
i like you tj
tj looks at her he doesnt really want to be mad at her
i understand if you dont want to be my friend
i didnt mean to hurt your feelings
sometimes i just
i dont know
i just wanted to come around and say all that but maybe you still hate me and so it doesnt matter but i just came round to say that but
ive said it now so i should just go
so ok bye
nicole walks off
she gets half way across the lawn before im sorry i broke your lamp
and im sorry i called you a fat prostitute
youre not fat
nicole smiles at this
but im a prostitute
they smile at one another
she crosses the lawn back toward tj
she fixes his tie
she smiles again and then she leaves
dad and tj sit in the front seat
they are still angry and not speaking to each other
it is an unpleasant and uncomfortable ride
they both wear a suit and tie
dad and tj drive into the funeral home parking lot in grandmas car
a few people are milling around
dad and tj enter the funeral home foyer
they look like they dont know where theyre supposed to go
they are greeted by the funeral director from earlier
he talks in a soft monotone whisper
excuse me mr
forney may i have a word
he takes dad aside
i hate to have to do this here but theres a couple of things i need to discuss with you quickly if thats ah sure
i know that we discussed your preferences for some aspects of todays service including your choice of the cedar casket which the insurance company had covered
unfortunately we were out of those and instead weve chosen a mahogany casket
now there is an extra charge for the mahogany which i need to clear with you before we proceed
is that dad looks confused
he doesnt know how hes supposed to respond
ah i guess
ok great thank you
if you could just sign here
the director hands dad a fancy pen and holds out a dense order form for him to sign
just at the bottom there
dads pen hovers
he doesnt know where hes signing
just here mr
forney just under that
yes thats great
dad signs and hands the pen back
now just one other thing we have another service following yours today we hate to do this but were going to have to try to get through yours as quickly
the funeral directors cell phone vibrates loudly on his belt
he ignores it
i dont want you to feel rushed but we are really under the pump today and i just thought i should give you the heads up
now i notice just looking at your order of service
beat thinking ah look lets play it by ear
we should be fine
dad looks at the funeral director not quite sure hes hearing him right
the funeral directors phone continues to vibrate
the funeral director walks away and answers his phone
the funeral director stands at the front of the room
he hits play on the in house stereo generic classical musak
tj and dad take seats next to each other but they might as well be a hundred miles apart
about ten other people sit
the funeral director hits stop
he stands and approaches the microphone
we are gathered here today to mourn the loss and commemorate the life of madeleine frances forney
to arriving late comers ah if you could please take your seats as quickly as possible thatd be great
he waits a beat madeleine was a beloved wife mother grandmother and friend
and now mrs agnes rosowski a dear friend and neighbor will say a few quick words
mrs agnes rosowski hobbles her way to the microphone
i did not know madeleine long enough but from the moment i moved into the neighborhood so many years ago she treated me as though i was part of the
madeleine always had open arms and welcomed friends as kindly as her own
she had such a kind wonderful heart
while agnes speaks tj and dad notice the funeral director off to the side whispering business to two of his employees
he makes every attempt to be subtle and discreet about it but he is clearly struggling with todays workload
we shared so many wonderful walks and enjoyed each others company very much
i will miss our walks
i will miss our talks and most of all i will miss madeleine
i will always remember what she told me life is like walking in the rain you can either hide and take shelter or you can just get wet
she was dear to me and she will always have a place in my heart
agnes places her hand on grandmas coffin and stands for a long silent beat
i love you madeleine
another drawn out moment of silence
the funeral director takes this opportunity to step to the microphone
ok thank you agnes
agnes steps towards her seat
when she sees tj she stops
tj i think you should say something
the funeral director pauses awkward
everyone looks at tj
go on tj
tj gets up reluctantly
he doesnt know what to say
he stands at the microphone and struggles for a long beat but nothing comes out
tj makes his way off the stage
sound of slow clapping from the back
his hair looks extra greasy hes wearing a dirty white budweiser t shirt and hes holding a tall can of beer under his arm which spills as he claps
he is very drunk
the funeral director tries to wrap it up
ok so at this point we should conclude todays service with a moments silence after which lemonade will be served in the
actually id like to add to tjs speech
i think i know where he was going with that
hesher stands and makes his way to the front
the funeral director tries politely to protest
im sorry sir
dad stands up in the aisle and tries to stop hesher
what are you doing here
up on the stage funeral home employees begin wheeling grandmas coffin away
hey hey hey
hesher pushes past dad and stops the coffin
what are you doing
get your fuckin hands off that box
the funeral director walks up to hesher
im sorry sir we really need to hesher turns and stands at the microphone
the funeral director looks over to dad not sure what to do
he lightly puts his hand on heshers arm to guide him off stage
im sorry sir hesher pushes the funeral directors arm away hard
you touch me again ill rip your fucking head off and skull fuck you
the funeral director backs off scared and unsure of what to do
i know you guys dont want me here and i dont want to fucking be here but im not here for me im fuckin here for her hesher gestures to
and im not fuckin here to say goodbye or have my farewell or whatever the fuck you assholes call it this is not how i want to say goodbye to
someone i like in this shit hole with these hesher points to the funeral director
tjs dad stands and interrupts
ok this is enough yeah well why dont you shut up for a second and listen cause im going to say what i want to say and then youll never
see me again
there is a beat of silence
no one knows what to say or do
im here cause shes been trying to tell you guys something but you dont want to listen
so im gonna fuckin break it down
hesher takes a long pull from his beer can
i pulled the gas tank from an old chevy and i wanted to fuckin blow it up so i did
i didnt think about the millions of bits of metal that were gonna fly in every direction
i almost killed myself
i woke up in a hospital
i couldnt remember what happened and then this doctor at the end of my bed said son and i said dont call me son you fuckin cunt then he said
you blew off your nut
some shrapnel had penetrated my left scrotal sack and ripped the furry sucker right off
my left fucking nut was gone just like that
hesher makes a magic disappearing arm gesture spilling a bit of beer on the floor
i went crazy
i assaulted a nurse a doctor or two i cant remember
i got arrested
i got sent to juvie
but all i could think about day and night was my missing fuckin nut
i couldnt eat or sleep i just wanted my fucking nut back
i had to get out of there and find it so i busted out of juvie and went lookin for it
i looked for days but didnt find shit
the tiny crowd listens half offended half intrigued
and then one night i was taking a shit and i was just staring down at my balls looking at my flabby piece of sack where my left nut used
to be and then i noticed my right nut for like the first time
my right nut was just sitting there totally happy just hanging out
all this time id been driving myself crazy thinking about my missing nut and not thinking about the nut i still had all along
and i realized ive still got a nut
ive still got one good nut
god or the devil or whoever left me with one good nut
at least i didnt lose both my nuts
ive still got one good nut and it works and my dick works too
hesher looks up at tj and dad sad and imploring hes made his point
they look back at him stunned
you lost your mom
you lost your wife
i lost a nut
hesher takes the last swig of his budweiser
he sways drunk
this soaks in with the crowd
hesher throws the can down
he goes to stomp on it
he misses and stumbles crashing into the microphone podium knocking it over and falling in a heap with it
he starts puking on the stage
a couple of old ladies are horrified
the funeral director motions to his assistants that now is the time to move the coffin out
hesitantly they obey
hesher looks over from the floor
leave her alone
were not finished yet
unfortunately sir we need to be
they continue to push the coffin away
hesher lifts himself up and wipes the vomit from his face and steps toward the coffin
the funeral workers back away
i told grandma i was going on a walk with her and im gonna do it
determined hesher leans down and unlocks the wheels of the coffin stand
dad stands not exactly sure what to do
with purpose hesher pushes the coffin down the stage ramp and down the center aisle of the room toward the exit
he turns to you promised grandma youd go on a walk with her
this is your last chance
hesher seems overcome with emotion he continues pushing the coffin toward the exit and out through the doors
tj and dad watch him unsure
after a moment they follow him to the door
they stand at the doors watching hesher push the coffin out into the parking lot
tj is overcome with emotion his eyes well with tears
he heads across the lot and catches up with hesher joining him on the walk
dad watches for a beat his eyes well up too then he does the same
all three are now walking together through the funeral home parking lot with grandmas coffin
they dont speak
its a release
other mourners watch from the doorway
hesher wheels grandmas coffin across the parking lot with tj and dad beside him
they seem solemn and strangely dignified in a dishevelled way
hesher leads them out of the parking lot and into the street
traffic passes around them
some cars come to a complete stop
hesher gets the coffin up onto the sidewalk on the other side of the street and the three continue their silent walk with grandma
in slow motion the three walk
dad puts his arm around tjs shoulders tj puts his arm around dads
and then a cop car cruises beside them slow
the cops inside watch them
dad looks over
one of the cops smiles
the cop car pulls up outside the house
the back door opens and hesher falls out onto the sidewalk still very drunk
dad climbs out and steps over hesher helping him to his feet
a cop speaks to them from the open window
youll get him to bed now wont you
thats the plan
hesher squirms and slurs
get your hands off me pig
thats the plan
the cop gives them a casual wave as their car pulls away
tj and dad help hesher across the lawn to the front door
we hold on the house for a beat
close on scissors to beard
dad stands over the sink cutting away at his beard
golden sunlight pours in through the windows
a moment later he lathers his face up with shaving cream
theres a gentle knock at the door
tj wakes and makes a big stretch
his hairs a mess
dad enters hes clean shaven now
he looks like a new man
look at you
it feels weird
i can feel air on my face
i hardly recognize you
i think heshers gone
i dont know
but i think you should come take a look at this
the garage door is open
the garage is flooded with daylight and no sign of hesher
tj and dad walks across the garage to the open door
at the garages entrance they stop
their eyes register something seriously unusual outside
master of puppets by metallica punches in
a giant red cube of volvo scrap metal has been placed in the center of the driveway like a huge piece of abstract art
they stand and stare at it almost in awe
then from the across the street we see the object in the driveway and tj and dad on the porch looking at it
we also see the words hesher was here
spray painted on the front of the house in big letters as yet unseen by tj and dad
dad puts his arm around tjs shoulders
on the beat we cut to hesher ripping on the guitar hesher blowing something up hesher cupping a fart and putting it in tjs face hesher pantsing dad hesher metal
saluting grandma and grandma saluting him back
hesher behind the wheel of his van smoking a cigarette and making a direct line for the setting sun
a mouse sits an in a tiny armchair like a human shelling a peanut
he throws the shell over his shoulder watching the setting sun
