pip wants a goodnight kiss
where are you
on vaughns face as he struggles to find the right words vaughn sits in the conservatory and drinks his morning tea
his gaze out into the garden is broken by something in the cup in the tea that gets his attention
troubled and preoccupied he frowns as he looks at the tea in the tea cup
his daughter pip rushes into the conservatory in her pyjamas and throws herself on him her beloved wonderful daddy
vaughn catches her and tickles her and laughs with her
but his indecision darkens his tired eyes with stress
page vaughn saws wood fastened in a workbench vice
the usual garden shed clutter of garden furnature and bikes around him
there is a tense manic regularity to his saw strokes
a sound os makes him stop sawing were off
once upon a time
pip says something inaudible outside
vaughn goes to the shed door
he doesnt really look outside
see you later
he half waits for a response but when there isnt one he returns to the workbench
he re grips the saw and starts to saw again but the saw gets jammed in the wood
vaughn tries to saw free it with increasing desperation and anger until we vaughn pretends to read the paper in the kitchen
the front door opens
the voices of mia and pip approach os
mia s enters the kitchen with several shopping bags
she doesnt look at vaughn
vaughn watches in a distracted way
pip you helping me or what
pips footsteps climb the stairs
a girly grunt os
not looking at vaughn any more takers
as she speaks super subtitle the real meaning of her words what the fuck is wrong with you
page vaughn grunts something then goes to help her but its half hearted
he can barely remember where the cereal goes
wrong time of the month
vaughn laughs slightly too loudly
still no eye contact
his mind elsewhere he helps her put the shopping away
mia takes a deep breath to control herself
i love you with every fibre
to the end
vaughn holds a can of soup all thats left of his dignity
mia puts the shopping away in the cupboards and the fridge
the tension is palpable
silence strangles them both
mia finishes putting things away without looking at him
the last item goes in the last cupboard
bags are stored
vaughns body is wracked by guilty tension
still no eye contact you out later then darling
dont do this to me please
vaughn hides his torment and indecision as best he can
i dont know
i dont love you anymore
just follow your heart
mia takes the can of soup from him and puts it away
page eventually fine
do i disgust you that much
mia leaves the kitchen without looking at him
vaughn mia and pip sit at the table eating lunch
but why not
daddy said we could
vaughn reacts half heartedly but lovingly to pip
mia pretends everything is fine the stiffness of her body and the smile
im not sure sweetheart
seductive whisper you promised
vaughn looks at pips hands
the stony road ahead
daddys not feeling too well darling
im sure a swim will do us all good
the lack of eye contact with vaughn speaks volumes
mia said youd
mia chastises pip
vaughn manages to smile
he wants to throw up
page sure thing nitwit
lets give it half an hour to let our lunch go down
daddy you are a lying piece of shit
mia bustles pip out of the front door
pip is in tears
but why cant daddy come
vaughn stands in the kitchen doorway
theres a crack in mias voice that destroys vaughn
mia closes the door after them
he sees their shapes through the frosted glass of the front door
vaughn sits staring unseeing at the tv which babbles saturday afternoon crap
he picks up his mobile
he thumbs through his text messages
he opens one
it says do it
do it for me
xxx he stares at it
he suddenly stands takes a deep breath and gets control
a decision makes itself
pip lies in her bed
scared she hears her parents voices through the wall
anger and resentment sadness and shock
wracked with self loathing vaughn stands awkwardly beside the bed
mia stares at him incredulous
tears blur her eyes
ive given you every last atom
she expresses the giving of herself in an unconditional way
vaughn tries to express something anything
page outside the house vaughn throws an overnight bag onto the back seat of the car
he gets into the car
he slams the door shut grips the steering wheel
the enormity of it is impossible
he doesnt look up at pip looking down at him from her bedroom window
that would break him
worse it might change his mind
he starts the engine
vaughn sits on a bench and waits
he pulls his coat around him against the biting cold
he checks his mobile again
the unthinkable crosses his face
but then brooke walks across the playground toward him
she sees him hurries
it takes him a moment to recognise her
that troubles him
he smiles at her his first smile in a long time
her smile speaks of very real joy after very real pain
he stands in order to greet her
she tries not to cry but its impossible
she embraces and kisses him passionately
she looks at him like hes all she ever wanted
he sees disguised scars on her face
the scars of pain in her eyes
will you come out and play
she holds him lays her head against his chest
she has found her home in him
and he is unsettled
brooke opens the door of the fridge in the kitchen for vaughn
beer water or tea
the worlds your oyster
vaughn smiles at her looks around
its pretty crummy
how long have you been here
page three months four days seven and a quarter hours
white one sugar
this is going to work
all i want
she does a little dance for him bows low
she smiles her love
he accepts it
he wants it all of it
she puts the kettle on
a beat of silence
what you did
i mean i appreciate what youve done for me for us
all i can tell you is that it will be worth it
were meant to be together v
youve always said that
his mobile phone bleeps a text message
he ignores it
you dont owe me anything
i made a choice
he grabs her kisses her
he looks like a man trying to convince himself that if he ignores it reality will go away
emotion overwhelms her so she gets busy with the tea
vaughn looks around again and out of the window
a cheap view too
ive been waiting to show you
she smiles again
taking her cue he looks at the portrait photography on the walls in the living room
my god brooke
he is lost for words
page you want to grab a shower
we should go out and celebrate
she does another little dance of joy
youre telling me i stink
she screams a little laughs a lot
she buries her nose in his armpits or tries to
they play fight and kiss
the kiss develops into more
she wants him
they are lost in each other until vaughn slows them down pulls back slightly gently
ill take a shower
ill show you
might even watch you
a man in my shower
the little boy a little girl fell in love with
once upon a time
the boy inside hes still in there somewhere
the kettle boils
it doesnt turn itself off
they hold each others eyes
the kettle over boils
the thing between them builds and builds until she suddenly laughs and turns the kettle off
he indicates upstairs and then exits upstairs
she watches him go
her excitement is obvious
if she senses that something is wrong there is no outward sign of it
images brooke being attacked by a knife wielding lover brooke curled in a bloody ball weeping brooke the year old child playing with a year old boy in long lost
p a g e dusting snow off them vaughn and brooke come through the front door which brooke closes behind them
theyre drunk laughing and sexual
snow falling is visible outside
vaughn and brooke fall onto her bed
they undress each other
the momentum builds until knife scars on brookes body are revealed
he sees them
she turns the light off tries to hide them
she tries to make light of it but shes ashamed of them
the momentum of their desire founders and stops
eventually im so sorry
accept me i beg you
hushing her dont be daft
how can i want you
you dont need to be
take your time
whatever happens please
she smiles at him gets under the duvet
he stands awkwardly beside the bed a moment and then gets in beside her
they lie separately for a moment and then vaughn embraces her softly
she pulls the duvet up to her neck to hide her body totally
you didnt tell me
what the hell happened
p a g e its nothing
he embraces her reassures her
but he is troubled
all in good time ok
tell me now
we have forever
oh my love
she kisses him holds him as if she never wants to let go
we have forever
image brooke being shanked by her jealous ex lover
snow has turned the world into a postcard
with a kiss and a wave mia drops pip off at primary school
she looks like she hasnt slept but manages to be cheerful
mia drives then stops the car down an isolated country lane
her mask of courage shatters she begins to weep like a child
vaughn pulls up in his car after work
he gets out
he looks at the deep tracks his car has made in the white snow
he looks at the outside of the flat
he hesitates then goes in
p a g e vaughn enters
brooke rushes to him smothers him in kisses
they hold each other
for a moment he is free of care
good day bad day
if this doesnt work
vaughn struggles to find an answer to such an inane question
got something for you lover boy
i will do anything
she steps back does a ta dah
and gestures towards the brooke leads him in by the hand
a new suit some new shirts new business and casual shoes and some mens accessories lie on the kitchen table
dirty crockery lies in the kitchen sink
he goes to the new gear handles it and smiles at her
why didnt you tell me
so now youve got everything you need here
it will be your fault your responsibility
he takes her hand glances back at the unwashed dishes
p a g e forgive me
you never call me that
he pulls her too him
she smarts at his strength so he holds her gently nurtures her
their passion builds
vaughn and brooke shower together
he washes her body gently
vaughn and brooke get into bed together
candlelight illuminates their naked bodies and throws shadows around them
they start to make love but then vaughn stops
she is deeply hurt but puts a brave face on it
he doesnt know what to do
its awkward between them her pain and his change of heart
image brooke being shanked by her jealous ex lover
vaughn and brooke in bed it should be heaven but its hell
p a g e vaughn enters the house awkwardly
mia avoids his eyes
hes wearing the new clothes brooke bought him
eventually pips with mum
what have i done
an emotional wreck mia nods
how is she
my family is my world
dont start vaughn
what kind of a fucking stupid question is that
hows my daughter now that ive walked out on her and her mother and run into the arms of my childhood sweetheart
vaughn is clearly shocked that mia knows what she knows
jesus the false caller ids on your phone
i mean please
and remember eye contact
you should try private browsing or at least clear your history every now and again
for someone whos in fucking it
so what now
you want some clothes your tool box the toaster a divorce
vaughn doesnt know what to say how to react
have them all
on the house
she cant hold it back any longer
she weeps her agony
p a g e now fuck off please
you piece of shit
she stumbles at him pounds him with her fists but when she hits him she recoils from the contact with his body
she wipes her hands of the contact with him
what am i supposed to do now bastard tell me tell me tell
she collapses sobbing uncontrollably
vaughn glimpses something through the living room door he hasnt seen before a white feather lying on the dresser
it holds his attention until he exits the front door
vaughn sits in rush hour traffic
the cars ahead of him are moving but he sits static staring ahead
car horns blare
his satnav sounds bizarrely loud suddenly in point two of a mile keep right
the dashboard lights seem to swirl around him
he puts his brief case down
nothing so brooke
brooke suddenly jumps out from behind the kitchen door
she laughs and runs toward him but he isnt impressed
p a g e nothing
what dyou think
were you always this stupid
blimey someone lost their sense of humour
vaughn frowns deeply hides his irritation
the tv babbles os i thought youd be pleased for me
i got a job
hes rained on her parade and now he feels like crap
i dont care anymore
start on monday
itll be good for us we can be dinkys
i beg you with all my life
its great really
forgive me i want only that
let me get you a drink
drink for my king
she twirls a seductive finger around his tie
p a g e vaughn and brooke begin to make love in bed
its better this time their passion builds its going to be ok
but then he begins to falter and she begins to cry
her cry becomes a vaughn pulls back from her looks at her
for god sake
she suddenly seems alone naked on the bed
she tries one last time she goes to him touches him but he cant respond
and now her dream is over
who did this to you
does it matter
he was jealous
hes everything youre not
you love me
you dont need to fear him
theyre just scars
oh god no
theyre just scars for god sake
this is my body
vaughn searches for words but he finds only his reality
reaching critical emotional mass she gets up quickly puts the overhead light on
it seems stark and horribly bright
she weeps reveals her damaged knife scarred body to him
can you see properly
of her scars do you like them
image brooke being shanked by her jealous ex lover
vaughn suddenly feels as vulnerable as she looks
p a g e incredulous why didnt you tell me
smart question vaughn smart
he looks at her
he sees suicide in her eyes
she suddenly lunges for him starts to punch him
to vaughn this now has the quality of a nightmare
this is impossible
shes no match for him but he is half hearted
he takes it
she smashes at him
his nose and mouth bleed
love me bastard
she screams like a wild animal goes to punch him again but vaughn snaps he lashes out at her sends her flying backwards
she lands badly gasping with pain and shock
vaughns bloody mouth begins to form the word sorry again
it doesnt matter
long beat go back to her
go back to mama
its where you belong
vaughn stands there panting bleeding wishing he could cry
on vaughn naked bleeding and alone as he tries to react we p a g e story stanislavski the shoes squeak as the man wearing them walks down a lino
these are the kind of shoes worn by a man who works long hours on his feet
it becomes clear that the man has a very slight limp
he walks down a strip lit corridor in the man who wears the shoes is mo s a very well built dark haired guy with a sensitive yet watchful and
mo is a security guard he wears security guard paraphernalia on his uniform belt keys torch walkie talkie etc
he stops and listens so the slightly uneven squeaking stops
he hears distant voices in the this place is huge
its also soulless and grim
row upon row of gated storage areas are crammed with peoples belongings
between these rows walks cy s with female admin staffer dolores s
cy has a dishevelled look of a man who has stopped searching for his dreams
self dissatisfaction hatred even haunts his tired face
he doesnt want to be here
though normally theres a charge for that
of course there is
they approach a storage area numbered
dolores reaches for a skeleton key attached to her belt by a security chain
p a g e here we go
dolores unlocks the storage area
she pushes the door open
there you go
cy enters the storage area
he starts rummaging through boxes
a door opens and closes in the distance
dolores mobile rings
she answers it
into the phone well i cant be two places at once now can i
then mos around somewhere
then i will
she ends the phone call looks os
here he is now
calls out mo
a slightly uneven squeak approaches
mo rounds a corner at the end of a storage row
mo could you please just see mister caudwell out
he just needs to pick something up
there is an unusually long delay before mo responds
mo approaches and stops when he reaches dolores
no sweat doll
how many more times
but shes smiling
theres familiarity between them
when mo smiles however the smile seems out of place on his face
no worries doll
p a g e mo laughs
a strange laugh
she throws him an angry face
sorry mister caudwell
mo here will see you out
i have to
she heads off pulling one last face at mo as she goes
ok indifferent thanks
cys voice is barely audible as he rummages in boxes
mo looks in at him
he gets a text checks it and responds
with a ha
cy pulls something out of a box
as he does so he shifts his weight from his right foot to his left
cy emerges from the storage area looking flushed with effort
mo goes to lock storage area
cy looks at the object he has retrieved an old vhs video cassette
mo sees it
wow thats an old vhs isnt it
it is indeed
are we done
cy speaks to him grudgingly
he wants to get the hell out
the door locked mo starts to walk away from with cy
aint seen one of those for years
never used one
cy walks way ahead of mo
the hell out of here
wait i gotta sign you out man
you got the forms
p a g e man
what the hell happened to sir
his disgust is obvious in the way he avoids looking at mo
youre a knight
the queen dub you or something
if i dont call you sir that doesnt mean i dont respect
it just means i dont call you sir
it doesnt really matter
cy walks faster but mo knows he doesnt know where hes going
mo looks more closely at him
wait youre that director
can we please just finish up and go
seriously i know you
im an actor
we met once
cy keeps walking but doesnt know where hes going
youve got the wrong man
we met at an audition

you must remember
like i said
p a g e cy wont slow down so mo puts a hand on his shoulder
the fuck do you think youre doing
take it easy
im only asking
cy looks at him for the first time
mo sees his bitterness
cy turns away to carry on walking
how the hell do we
he looks around
left or right
mo gets his mobile out
he goes to photograph cy
what the hell are you doing
come on man just a j peg to let my buddies know i saw you
i photograph everything

but you youre the man who directed
cy turns away irritated
he looks around up at the roof
a sign or two might help

but slow down you must remember me
youre thats it name begins with c
what the fuck is the matter with all this
ive got my thing now i just want to get out of here
lets sign the papers and i cant quite believe there are papers and im done
p a g e they stand at a junction between rows
left or right
so whats on the the vhs video
mo laughs a little at the whole idea of a vhs
mind my business is on the video
is that all right
its fine bro but hostility aint working
not in here
cy looks around
it seems like a labyrinth
mo clicks his fingers remembering suddenly it was that show that play you were directing
four five years back

so can we go now
sure but look whats with all the storage
you moving house or something
something like that
look show me the way out of here now man or ill have to speak to your supervisor

mo looks up and waves to a cctv camera
dolls in the doll house doing doll things
p a g e out
mos attitude changes noticeably in response to this
relax mister c
out is way
mo leads cy off
cy is suddenly more wary of him
they walk in silence a moment
the uneven squeak
look i dont want you to mind me talking to you and all
im just being friendly one pro to another
beat come on man
dont go believing this is my shit because it aint
actings my shit just like directings yours
i was born to it know what i mean

cy thats it
he offers his hand to shake
cy takes it very grudgingly
they shake hands
cy fully takes in mos physical size and power
well thats better
no need for hostility between pros
mo lets go of cys hand
cy is relieved
they walk on
looking around for exit how hard can this be
as cy speaks above pros or hos know what im saying
its a strange sound
whats on the video
none of my biz i know but im curious
p a g e if you must know its a show reel
an old one
got the old bit
looks at the vhs
laughs aint you got one online
they round a corner
cy twigs theyre back where they started
get us the fuck out of here or im going to
cy reaches for his mobile phone
he goes to dial but mo it out of his hand
it hits the floor and breaks
people coming and going and cars and lorries and the city skyline
nothing out of the ordinary
the way things are
cy stares at his smashed phone at mo
mos face is a mask
the mask eventually moves
confusion hits mos face
its as if another part of him did that a part he cant control
look sorry about that dude but you need to let me know
thats my simple question what happened
panic starts to show itself in cys face
i didnt get the job
mo shifts his weight from his right foot to his left
cy glances around at his smashed phone on the floor
p a g e he looks up sees cctv cameras
he stoops down to pick up the parts of his broken phone
he finds the sim card pockets it
theres something pathetic about the way he stoops
the silver thing
cy stands meets mos gaze full on for the first time really
look i dont know
actors we would have seen dozens
i mean it was a long time ago
i dont know what you mean what happened
mo just looks at him
if you didnt get it you didnt get it
its the nervous laugh its the way of the world no
mo just looks at him
a door opens and closes somewhere
this is ridiculous
cy sets off on his own walking again
hes had enough
i know how good you are
cy stops turns
i know your true potential
i know your talent doesnt belong packed up in here
and youve failed
cy swallows air
what are you doing
you dont think i know how you more p a g e contd feel
i feel it
i feel failure in here every day and every fourth sunday
i feel like brilliance left to rot too
thats how you feel no
you feel it when it wakes you to tap on your shoulder and say this is what you could have been this is what you are storage boxes
shocked what the fuck business is it
if i held an audition you failed four or five years ago im sorry
if youre working in here not up in lights im sorry
youre sorry for yourself
thats in your face
cy pulls himself together
this is fucking absurd
of his broken phone criminal damage
cy starts off walking again
cy were done here seriously
then ill sign you out
you can ask about the mobile phone you dropped but i doubt you can claim it on us
just tell me why youre all stored up in here
he gestures then theyre out of here
mo isnt it
what does that mean mo
in any event i can promise you repercussions
i dont care what you think of me
i wont be treated like this
p a g e beat
brave mister caudwell
solid citizen i dont think
just need to know what youre doing
then thats the end of it all
my landlord asked me to move out
couldnt pay your rent
why dont you just say that
i couldnt pay my rent mo
its called la crunch du credit
and here we are
cy swallows waits looks for cctv cameras
mo shifts his weight from his right foot to his left
in that single moment cy knows hes in a situation he cant control
were almost nearly seriously out of here mister caudwell
some strip lights turn off way down the warehouse
on timers saves power
you must know
auto ma tic
cy glances at his watch
time to go home cy
my only ask is this
and you dont have to say yes say anything
all i ask is we do it again
cy looks at him
do what again
strange laugh i know
i know it sounds strange
bit silly even
but if you just let me run the thing again this time ill nail it swear
p a g e more strip lights turn themselves out
of the vhs in cys hand i mean
on a fucking vhs video cassette
wheres noah when you need him
it sounds bizarre in the infinity of the depot
mos suddenly killing himself laughing
crying with it
cy starts to run
lightning fast mo intercepts him grabs him pulls him down
lets run this again from the top cy
youll go down for this
i absolutely swear
ill report this to the police your superiors
this is fucking
mo hits him
not a killer blow but enough to shut him up
people coming and going and cars and lorries and the city skyline
nothing out of the ordinary
the way things are
mo leads drags cy towards a half empty storage area
holding cy mo unlocks and pushes cy inside
mo locks the door behind them
its dark and to cy feels like a cage
you think you can actually do this
what the fuck
cy screams help
mo looks around
he pulls up a box on one side and sets an old chair opposite it on the other side of the caged area
p a g e cy throws himself at the door heaves at it
what the fuck sunshine
equity subscriptions lapsing are they
cy seriously man who directed nothing lets just get this right
then we can get on with things
you can go back your self loathing and i can continue my rounds
loud to anyone again for help fuck you
mo smashes his fist into cys face
what the fuck is the matter with you
jesus not in here bro
christ a nipple sucked by mugs
one born every minute tick tock
mo flicks his keys around in circles
shock grips cys throat
so whats the brief
whats the scenario
set the scene for me
point me in the right direction
even brando needed goalposts
cy looks around for escape
a phone rings somewhere os
the phone stops ringing
a silent vastness of industrial dark
p a g e no sweat doll
this place is damn big
and youre talking to the big expert here
shows cy his shoes gotta do a circuit every hour
beat we gonna just do this thing then its home free
cy tries to slow his breathing down get a grip
thats it old fella
get sorted out
in and out
let it all be cool
cys breathing in the dark
no way out
youll be missed
he jerks his head
he means the office colleagues
well not really mister de mille
its just me and doll today
dont ya love them
cy tries the door again but its half hearted
set me straight mister director
mo stands suddenly and comes over to cy quickly
he grabs him by the hair and forces him to sit down on the old chair
the directors chair
what the fuck do you want
you know what i want
just like you another chance
audition me again you fucking vhs crumb
give me my brief
motivation reality the whole bit
mo sits down opposite cy on the box
p a g e cy stares at him
this is insane
but he has no choice
do what you want wanker
mo immediately gets up starts beating him to pulp
row after row of caged storage areas
no hint of violence
no sign of anything wrong
this is where mo should be his security vantage point
a crappy chair a crappy desk and cctv monitors staring
his hands shaking and panting from the exertion mo photographs cy with his phone
cy is beaten to a pulp
youll do time
youll go down
ill see to it
think you can fucking do this
mo applies lipstick mascara and powder to his face
then mo sits down
cy almost sobs
he spits blood
the scenario please cy
who am i
what do i want
youre a fucked up wannabe actor who never was and never will be who works as a security guard in a domestic storage depot
like most people you cant handle rejection but i mean you really cant handle it really i mean
lightning fast mo is on him beating him shitless
p a g e dolores hums gladys knight and the pips as she walks down a cheaply carpeted corridor in the admin area of the building
cy collapses under the onslaught of mos fists
mo grimaces at his damaged knuckles
he hauls cy back onto the box
he indicates his readiness again and waits
that wasnt the character i read for the last one i mean
my agent told me a soccer player who is afraid to tell his team mates of his homosexuality
he turns to his manager for help for answers to his dilemma but in the face of this of this outrage the manager who has been like a surrogate father
to him for years now turns against him disgusted that the boy he believed in turned out to be a lamentable sausage jockey
am i right
cy is too smashed and bloody and ruined to do more than grunt
but something catches his eye in the filthy gloom he sees a white feather lying on the ground in the corner of
im right man
that was the scenario wasnt it
the silver thing i auditioned for that you turned me down for
ignored me for
like the loser i was
the winner is here
in front of you
he smiles and waits for cy to look at him to audition him
make like a camera
p a g e at first cy doesnt understand but then he slowly agonisingly raises his hands up and mimes rolling a camera
its hard for cy to make the sound of a camera rolling
dolores sits down at her desk
gladys knight and the pips
cy mimes cranking a camera and makes camera noises
he glances over to where the white feather was but now he cant see it
without a script this time note
ad libbing free wheeling improvisazione herr director
mo looks into the camera and lives the role hes playing
in character all my life
imagine living a lie forever
not just the lies everybody lives day to day to get by play the game but one big lie that stretches from beginning to end a truth so hideous that
it could be called ordinary
a verity of the genes of psychology
and then imagine the one person the liar could turn to turning away so that the liar was left with nothing but the lie
imagine exploding with the desire to be what you are to be real and to be accepted for what you are perhaps even loved
not loved with money for playing games but loved with respect for having the strength to stand apart
but the works of the imagination must cede to that we call reality
more p a g e contd and here we are you choosing the side of the mob and me left outside in the cold
well ive got news for you turncoat i dont fucking care
ive got the future
mo ends the performance in tears
cy continues to crank the camera and make camera noises
eventually mo gets up and stops him with uncommon gentleness
he crouches down beside cy smooths his hair
so how was i
how was it
its agony but eventually cy manages to speak
you did it
you got the job
mo stands smiles basking in his moment of glory
this is his prize
this is his moment
but his face darkens
mo starts to beat cy gain but this time he kicks him too
he goes berserk throwing cy around like a rag doll pulping him
the room is empty
she approaches mos desk
she doesnt even glance at the bottle of prescription pills on which the word suppression is just visible
she glances at the cctv screens
she presses a button bringing up the display from another cctv
she sees the grainy monochrome image of cys pulped face being smashed against the bars of
as she gasps in horrified reaction and grabs the phone p a g e people coming and going and cars and lorries and the city skyline
nothing out of the ordinary
the way things are
very slowly gradually we p a g e story crackerjack footsteps and breathing the sounds of a young man running for his life
the staccato pounding of his feet becomes a mantra that builds until it develops a life of its own and a surreal edge
it becomes a ghostly dreamlike sound evil perhaps
the running footsteps suddenly stop
the breathing continues
between breaths aight am done runnin
do what ya gotta do
beat then austen plays skyrim on a brand new mac powerbook
the hi tech futuristic sheen of the apple is utterly at odds with the room austen is in money seems to be in short supply here
austen is a cut and paste hoodie a white boy going nowhere
jaden white enters
lean and strong jaden is savvy but drugs have left their mark on his face and in his eyes
what the fuck my fam
he grabs the mac from austen
they push and pull for it
fuck off now brah
jaden whacks austen around the head light but hard enough to break his grip
jaden puts the computer to one side the way he handles it suggests that replacing it would be a synch
austen attacks him but jaden restrains him
p a g e you got homework
do the work
austen makes for the mac again but jaden restrains him
they fight a moment but its futile austen pulls back humiliated and outraged
he kisses his teeth and birds
dont be doin that fam
its all wrong
you aint black yet
well aint you my brah
i am your brah
no force gonna make me otherwise
austen switches the tv on turns it up loud
fuck the homework
fuck ya future
jaden switches the tv off
austen squares up to him
a beat between him then austen backs down jaden is way too big
it all goes on the taps his head tab right
save it up for a rainy one
then i get mine right
well i got mine brah an you dont never want it swear
austen storms out of the room
gonna get my own white boy
home fuckin work
p a g e austen is now out of the room in the hallway beyond
you aint my dad fam
my dad aint my dad
the sound of the front door opening and slamming shut os
jaden curses thinks
jaden is always thinking
he exits suddenly
hood up jaden walks fast
its dark already and cold
jaden speeds up
he feels the reassuring bulge in his belt at the base of his spine
he does this often by habit
he gets a text
he checks the message
a police car cruises
jaden doesnt react to it but he does so in a way that suggests that this is a measured response
he grabs his phone hits some keys
someone picks up
into his phone where you at fam
my brah comin atcha somewhere near
owe ya back boy
he kills the call stows his mobile
a car slows near him and stops at traffic lights
jadens attention is drawn by a white feather on the back window shelf
a shadow crosses jadens face
the car pulls away
he approaches a group of young male hoodies smoking and texting outside a corner store
they greet with touched fists
jaden talks with a few of them and then walks on
its clear that he has their respect though they show it very subtly
cool and calm austen pockets a wad of cash
the youth hes with stuffs something in his jacket pocket
they touch fists
p a g e austen goes on his way
he feels like a proper man
he sees jaden way ahead
jaden sees him starts running
the streets blur around him into a narrative of his life the urban landscape dancing to the beat of his feet
runs runs runs jaden and austen they sprint the streets the alleys the music and then jaden catches him and on austens snarl freeze frame and in the kitchen diner
jaden austen and their dad paul s
paul says a prayer before they eat their corner shop meal
jadens hands are together in respect for paul
austen deliberately pays no attention to the ritual at all
for this gift of daily bread we thank thee oh lord
jaden throws austen a look
mean and fierce
and now suddenly we see what hes capable of
fear overcomes austens arrogance
he puts his hands together and closes his eyes
and for the gift of these fine sons i thank thee oh lord
the crucifix on the wall
christs tormented face in the cheap shadows of this dull crappy kitchen
its all paul has
beseech thee to look down on them and protect them with thy everlasting mercy
seeing jadens eyes now closed in prayer for pauls sake austen cant resist feeling the wad of new cash in his pocket
p a g e thanks be to god
the boys join him in amen jaden properly austen barely
they begin to eat their corner shop meal
austen sees a shadow cross jadens face as jaden remembers in washed out high grain jaden necks and smooches with a black girl called lycia
around them the party pops drugs and big bass and wannabe cool young kids getting into each other or off on each other
lycia smiles and laughs and love the attention but a young black guy j
looks death at her his girl then at jaden who meets the challenge of the alpha competition
jaden feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine
the meal over jaden does the dishes
paul sits at the table
austen playing skyrim in the next room is audible
paul breaks down in a fit of coughing
christ watches on
jaden suddenly leaves the sink and goes into the jaden grabs the mac off austen again
this time austen cowers
paul lights a cigarette
a moments pleasure
he slips into what might be a reverie or just exhaustion
on paul hearing this as paul might given his dislocated state of mind p a g e angry get with the fuckin homework swear
told ya before get on with it
calmer one life one chance my fam
i help ya no sweat
angry again just get with it ya little
the sound of a punch perhaps
he looks to christ
christ is tormented
jaden lifts up a floorboard in his bedroom
he looks at his stash of pills rocks and a pipe
half the rocks are missing
jaden bursts in but quietly
his silence doesnt diminish the power of his intent
scared austens looks up at him suddenly from his bed where he plays call of duty on a tv console
a whisper what the fuck brah
who been at my stash any thoughts
or thoughts nowhere near that tiny size brain raps on austens head with his knuckles
no one messes with my stash no matter who hear
aint no brah of mine gonna sink to stealing and dealin like some stinkin hood rat skunk jus to prove his manhood readin
is fuckin me and you got destiny swear
dont look to me
dont like me
dont follow me dont run from me dont watch me just get wiv the school shit and grow up like the old man wants hear
the potency of jadens emotion and words shocks austen but now austen shows nothing but the pride and power he admires
austen reaches into his jacket pocket on the chair by his bed
p a g e take the money brah just
jaden stops him
buy books study something
buy the old man a prezzie
if you ever do it again
austen nods reluctantly
he leaves the money where it is
jaden exits the room
later a knock on pauls door
jaden pushes the door open a crack revealing paul lost and alone on his bed in a tiny sliver of light among infinite council house darkness
seen like this the marks life has left on paul are obvious
a whisper goin out dad ok
paul just frowns
he seems too tired to speak
he expresses come back safely in a way that is very hard to bear
jaden enters the room
he tucks his old man up in bed safe
then he leaves the room quietly and pulls the door shut safe
he goes downstairs and exits the house quietly
the ceramic christ on the cross in the hallway is silent
he is assured and cool
this is his stage
he feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine
he gets a text
he checks the message likes it
he greets a group of other hoodies with small talk and fists
done he moves on down another street
he has goods to sell
he takes a call makes another texts and talks
p a g e swerves near him splashing him with headlights
jaden looks sees faces he doesnt want to see
he speeds up and then runs down a side street
the bmw follows
now jaden runs runs runs this is our first scene over again
the streets blur around him into a narrative of his life the urban landscape dancing to the beat of his feet
but jaden wasnt born to run
dodging up an alley he slows turns
the bmw doors open
three men get out follow him
the glint and sound of shanks being drawn ready
breathing hard but measured paul turns and faces them a big black guy an ugly white guy and a tall chinese guy
jaden feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine
between breaths aight am done runnin
do what ya gotta do
the big black guy comes at him with the shank
the hood from the party
the other guys back him up
an all dis for a three oh four
kisses his teeth you could had her anyways if youd asked me nice fam swear
lunges at jaden
his shank cuts jaden mid torso
the other guys follow up their blades flashing searching
jaden withdraws the bulge at the base of his spine
boom his gun speaks he shoots j
p a g e the gun speaks to the other two guys killing china outright and wounding the white guy badly
white guy falls screaming
shut the fuck
he kneels over white tries to stop him screaming
but he over and over blood pouring from his punctured chest
looks around desperate for him to stop it
already around him are changing as if they are turning to look but screams and grabs at his bleeding chest
his wild eyes beg
begins to fold to lose it as reality comes rushing in and he white guy dead
then after forever grow out of the darkness
jaden throws his gun away instinctively
he starts to run
changes his mind
turns and picks the gun up
sirens seem to haunt the city
and now jaden so that the city is just lights and people and cars and noise and people and darkness and people and there amongst them watching him his brother
and his idol
so now we p a g e jaden crouches down in the darkness blood on his hands blood on his shirt blood on his cut torso blood on his soul
jaden stashes his gun in a cloth under the floorboards
jaden is tormented by what hes done
and the other dead guys a bloodbath
jaden throws up on a street corner
jaden tucks his old man up in bed safe
all the time austen seems to be watching learning admiring
in the kitchen diner jaden austen and paul
paul says a prayer before they eat their corner shop meal
austen looks at the crappy bandages around jadens torso
jadens hands are together in respect for paul
austen prays but is now confused
hes scared but totally in awe of jaden
for this gift of daily bread we thank thee oh lord
jaden looks around his praying hands at austen
its a look that austen will never ever forget
the mac in the sitting room sits unused
the games console in austens bedroom sits unused
jadens room evening jaden winces with the agony in his cut bloody torso
p a g e christ stares unseeing in his ceramic torment in the kitchen
austen walks home from school
kids look at him
something has changed
blood runs down the plug hole in the dirty bath
austen hears the sound of the shower running
he enters he tiptoes to the floorboards near jadens bed
he very cautiously levers a floorboard up
crystals pills pipes weed but much more than before
but not what he wants to see
so austen puts the floorboard back
he goes to the door listens again
the shower still runs
he tiptoes back to jadens bed looks around
he lifts up jadens pillow
sits there sleek and cool and mighty and everything
slowly daring himself austen goes to touch it
his fingers linger on the smooth cool imperious steel
austen is a god
jaden and lycia make love
slow and perfectly tender and then hard and porn
on and on
bodies twisting in their search for each other
they come jadens body arching in torment
lycia cradles his head on her breasts
his breathing is uneven but then it evens out and slowly becomes calm
she looks at his bandaged torso
she is afraid
p a g e jaden walks the streets
hoods look at and greet him in a different way
respect but this is a dead man walking
jaden drives austen who is in his school uniform
his hands up on the wheel the dragon tat on jadens arm is visible
to austen jaden looks a little pale a little ill
they see a cop car
another passes them coming the other way
five oh everywhere
theyre called police
bacon fryin for breakfast
jaden throws him a look
their shared secret dominates their every breath
wots poppin with the pussy fam
jesus fucking christ
you mean hows the young lady in your life my blood
since when the fuck you become some kind of born again reggin
i wonder if you should mind you language in front of your baby brah blood
i say blood you say blood
i say brah you say brah
potato potarto tomato tomarto
they drive a while
then jaden sees that austens hair exactly matches his own in terms of its length and styling
p a g e you get your hair cut
they approach the school
austen glances at jadens torso and then gets out of the car
you turn into me and ill kill you hear
austen looks at him
tears well up in his eyes
emotionless jaden closes the car door and drives off
on the pavement austen watches him go
by torchlight under his duvet austen draws a tat on his forearm with a biro that matches jadens real tat perfectly
smoking a bong and drinking his headphones on and the music cranked high jaden fights an inner battle he can never win
he looks at his gun on his bedside table
a thing of new evil
septic the wound in his torso is draining him of life
jaden and austen kneel beside paul in prayer
except that jaden only kneels on one knee and austen on neither and neither of them are really praying
beside them paul prays with worshipers in the congregation of a dozen or so
jadens hoodie hood is down out of respect
austen has his hoodie hood up
jaden pulls it down
austen throws him a look kisses his tongue
jadens eyes darken
jaden looks over sees a man who seems wrong in here
he twigs plain clothes cop
cops dont pray and this one is
p a g e jaden sprints flat out through the people cars and lights
at this speed his footsteps are barely a fluttering staccato
he wont make it
lycia cowers in a corner
three masked guys stand over her
one has the shank pointing at her accusing hating her
this guy is familiar
broad black athletic he is similar to j
his name is linden
he is j
looks death at lycia his girl and then at jaden who meets the challenge of the alpha competition
with other hoods beside and behind j
brothers to the end
jaden feels the bulge in his belt at the base of his spine
linden pulls his mask off stares hatred at lycia
go fuckin my brahs enemy ho
my bloods white white enemy
for you hes dead
linden starts slicing her face up
on her screams jaden sprints flat out through the people cars and lights
he rounds a corner in time to see lindens car smoke away
p a g e lycia lies in a hospital bed
her whole head is bandaged
sounds of a busy hospital ward around them ebb and die
jaden holds her hand
paul brings tea into the living room for himself and the cop from the church
austen stands uneasily near the door
in his dress haircut and demeanour he is a perfect model of jaden
to paul thank you mister mountjoy
to austen i dont want you to feel pressured austen
you havent done anything so relax
paul goes to austen and puts an arm around his wonderful son
the cop sips the tea
cop contd oh thank you mister mountjoy
my brand costmarts own
smiles then to austen all i need to know is where your brother jaden is at the moment austen
when was the last time you saw him
you say he normally lives here where is he now today
confusion fills austens scared face
his dilemma is complete
silent in his agony christ watches on
austen lifts up the stash floorboard
there is nothing there
p a g e austen takes a breath then slices his torso in the same place jaden was cut
he hadnt expected it to hurt this much
blood flows down and out of the crappy bath plughole
austen dabs at his new manhood wound which wont stop bleeding
there are mountains of bloody toilet roll on the shelf and floor near him
on the toilet roll holder there is no paper left
austen looks at his new wound in the mirror
he makes a gun of his hand and shoots himself in the mirror
fugitive jaden stands looking into the flowing river
he is pale and gaunt and dirty
austen stands behind him
he looks exactly how jaden used to look
and his torso is bandaged
jaden squints at him
why you fuckin grass me up
though you was my brah
austen thinks about it for a while
i didnt tell the pigs
just falters then
just hugo up school
traffic sounds ebb and die
history flows down to the sea
told because i was proud of ya brah
jaden looks at him
proud of him
couldnt help it
jaden has to hold on to the railings now
what the pigs gonna do with ya
p a g e jaden looks around him
darkness is falling
austen produces a gun from the base of his spine
where the fuck
he stares at austens gun
tears blur the evening
he says it with his tears
this isnt going to happen to you
only way youre gonna stop me turning into you is by killing me brah
long one short
austen holds his arms out as if to say this is what i am
jaden reaches for the base of his spine
austen stands there waiting for jadens bullet
jaden takes his hand away from his gun
jaden mumbles something inaudible
say what brah
he indicates his ears that wanking makes you deaf laughs
a mumble said go home
fix dads tea
ill be there soon as
jaden stands there alone
its getting cold
jadens memory only way youre gonna stop me turning into you is by killing me brah
got a better idea baby blood
jaden pulls out his gun and shoots himself in the head
p a g e in the kitchen diner austen and paul at the table
paul says a prayer before they eat their corner shop meal
austens hands are together in respect for paul
but paul cant speak
austen sees his tears which escape from behind the barrier of his cracked hands like eager jewels
austen gets up and hugs his father with all his life
not remotely resembling jaden austen gets on with his p a g e story mea culpa then apparently mild mannered uri s writes on his desktop
he is dressed like an accountant conservative but efficient
his blue stocking home counties wife enters with a tray of tea
she puts the tray down and passes uri a cup of tea
wont be long
clicking off the word window on which hes working on his computer quickly he responds with a nondescript smile
she kisses his forehead and exits the room
uri re opens the window on his computer
he looks out of the window
uri is living with something that cant be lived with
he swigs from a bottle of jd that he retrieves from a drawer
he turns back to the computer reads what hes written
but now the buck must stop
exculpation is no longer an option
the state has lied to you mrs pentane and whatever the consequences i feel it my duty to put the record straight
why i feel thus obliged will become apparent should we meet
i leave that up to you
uri nods to moustachioed thug who is stretching as if he has pulled a muscle
shaved headed thug pulls a face
p a g e get some deep heat on it
frustrated if were kindly ready mister tyne
uri then goes back to reading his novel
thug almost smiles almost
not a face made for smiling
thug works out the tension in the pulled muscle
he then nicholas s a man tied naked to an old chair
nicholas is a mass of cuts sores burns and untreated wounds
he is filthy and unshaven
he is delirious with agony
nicholas barely reacts to the blow hes too far gone
without looking up from his book nicholas its really so very simple
nicholas tries to open a swollen bloodshot eye
uri nods to thug again but now thug pulls his blood soiled rubber gloves off
he goes to put a new pair on
uri puts his book down and pulls an exasperated face
thug steps in hungry for exercise
thug starts to beat nicholas up
he has the powerful fluid movements of a prize fighter
he treats this as a workout
thug looks outraged as if this is against union rules
thug works nicholas expertly and with professional care
alright alright thank you mister karaczun
this is getting them nowhere
uri looks at nicholas pulped face at the new damage that thug has done
thug stands back waits
p a g e uri stands goes to a cabinet and pulls out a set of surgical implements
he puts a pair of rubber sanitary gloves on
he lays out the implements on a metal table beside nicholas
he goes to work
elle s draws a female nude in white pastel on black paper
the drawing is as exquisite as she is if thats possible
elle is the kind of woman that men will do anything for the kind of unforgettable beauty you see very rarely
elle takes extreme care with the drawing
her attention to it and involvement with it is absolute
she is alone in the studio which contains other drawings and simple furnature
the sounds of uri torturing nicholas over are in extreme hideous contrast to the beauty of elle and her drawings
the contours of elles face and the fine lines and moments of shade in her drawing
the sounds of unimaginable suffering
five minutes of drawing
five minutes of nicholas screams
then the sound of uri dropping an implement and cursing
the thugs mumbling
a heart pulse falters and then stops
an electrocardiograph flat line sound
a beat then uri stands back
there is blood all over his rubber gloves and some on his apron
he looks at nicholas feels his pulse
nicholas is dead
uri sits at a huge polished oak business meeting table
he is now dressed in a business shirt tie and three piece suit
but a louche handkerchief in his breast pocket adds a touch of flare to his sombre ensemble
uri is somewhat frustrated
p a g e three other suits are at the table boothy s the boss silk s and parker s
all but parker are middle class and business like
in here pc efficiency is all
has the next of kin been informed
silk clears his throat
not yet sir
inform her theres never a good time
silk makes a note on his ipad
boothy looks at uri as if waiting for an explanation
the irony of that comment creates a response that emanates from boothy and travels round the table hierarchically
as the board understood it the prisoner was verified as the jihadi
there was dna
we now believe the evidenced might have been contaminated
not impressed was there any form of extraction
the suspect revealed nothing of the activities of which he was suspected by the board sir
fruit was not born
p a g e the oddness of that causes some rolled eyes around the table
it was a fruitless interrogation sir yes
boothy studies the information on his laptop
the others therefore do the same
uri smartens his suit and shirt cuffs
boothy eventually looks up from his laptop
so not only do we have no further intel about the event we have another next of kin a nuclear bloody winter of media fallout and the inevitable whitehall storm
we also have another body to
boothy ignores parker almost entirely
refers to laptop it says here the suspect did not respond to the usual stimuli
at uri stimuli
we explored the usual routes in accordance with our mandate
boothy and silk seem repulsed parker seems fascinated
to boothy if i may sir
to uri perhaps he told you nothing because he knew nothing
thats likely yes
this is the kind of thing the media gorges on for months
p a g e there is no need
boothy looks at uri
the others look at uri
nicholas pentane died while engaged in activities commensal with his profession as a freelance reporter from wounds sustained at the hands of insurgent personnel
he died behind enemy lines
he was transported home in a manner befitting a hero
he died while attempting to maintain the integrity and vibrancy of a free press a press we all
spare me the party line uri for god sake
thisll wiki itself sky high unless
its taken care of sir
they all look at him
the monster in their midst
eventually were getting off message here
it should be funny but somehow its sick
what were here to establish is how a freelance writer gets wrongly arrested subjected to makes quotation marks with his fingers rendition and is then tortured by experts in the
certainty that he is in fact a terrorist planning acts against the common good
on home soil against the great british public et cetera
beat he was as innocent as any of us
any answers uri
p a g e silence a beat then mistakes happen sir
the man wrote a column for the economist for god sake
silence a beat then the best moles have the best covers sir
they simply always do
boothy looks at uri in a particular way
what we also need to establish is whether he was killed deliberately or by
in his y fronts only uri stands in his bathroom and scrubs his hands manically in the sink
his hands are rubbed raw by the scrubbing
he whimpers as he does this
his body shakes
boothy glances at parker
he doesnt need any help thank you
the human body can only take so much sir
subjected to a certain level of pressure it buckles
nicholas pentanes body simply broke under duress
the mind body continuum
the mind body continuum
boothy reads something else on his laptop p a g e np was arrested on the night of the fourth reads more then transported under guard to the facility
work began on the seventh to determine
boothy removes his glasses looks at uri
so what was going on between the fourth and the seventh
uri clears his throat
i was on holiday sir
malaga again sir
my wife does like it there
well not a bad choice at that time of year
we recommended that to do didnt we
you did sir yes
your wife actually sent us the brochure if you recall
the phone rings
elle leaves her drawing reluctantly but then smiles when she answers the phone
she misses her man
then disappointed yes
then with dread yes
we actually tried corfu this year
not bad though it could have been warmer
elle listens to the caring sharing voice on the phone
p a g e she listens then puts her hand to her mouth
her beautiful eyes cloud with tears
she starts to buckle and sway
then she collapses
theres a certain grace to the way she does it
i can actually recommend crete at this time of year
a bit populous but there are places where one can escape the hordes
elle drops the phone
boothy and parker laugh at with silk
uris face is stone
oh lord michael if we left it to you well all be holidaying on the norfolk broads
silk pulls a well actually face
there is some laughter until boothy stops laughing and re focusses on their agenda
boothy reads from his laptop again then removes his glasses
what were left with is something of a mess
im sure you agree
he looks at uri and waits
the others do the same
sorry sir i dont suppose we could get some
uri makes a thirsty gesture
mildly irritated boothy presses a button on an intercom
it buzzes the other end then into the intercom sharon could we get some more coffee please
to the others biscuits
the others nod except uri and some biscuits
actually if there are any chocolate digestives
on the intercom certainly sir
p a g e into the intercom thanks sharon
boothy scratches his head refocuses
dressed like an accountant uri writes on his desktop
my desire to meet with you arises from a strong urge to inform you of the circumstances under which your husband actually passed away
the fact is mrs pentane that you have certainly been misinformed
uri looks up out of the window
he looks at his hands
they seem so ordinary so dull and so average
he drinks more jd
uri accepts the coffee sharon pours for them all
she puts a plate of digestives down on the table and leaves the room
sharon smiles a response
she closes the door behind her
parker reaches out and grabs a digestive which he eats
mouth full never can resist the bloody things
to parker make yourself at home minister
boothy and silk grab a biscuit
uri sips his coffee
the coffee is scalding
he has scalded his tongue
p a g e in the last moments of his life nicholas screams and writhes under the onslaught of agony delivered by uri with his surgical instruments
nicholas is a pulped mess of blood
elles face is contorted by grief
she is curled in the foetal position on the floor
she weeps desperately
she staggers to her feet
she goes to a built in wardrobe
she opens his side of it
his suits and shirts hang in quiet rows
she presses into them embraces them sobbing and screaming her agony
uri thinks a moment and then click send with his mouse
he takes a deep breath
uri gets out of the taxi and pays the driver
he then turns to face the address
he tries to move naturally but his body is stiff with misgiving
he takes a breath to try to calm himself
he manages to walk to the front of the apartment block
he starts to walk up the steps to the front door but then he retreats
he steps backwards then begins to walk away
he cant do it
his hands are shaking
he makes fists to stop them
he takes another breath looks up at the apartment block
he is sick with stress
he forces his limbs to obey him
he manages to walk back to the steps
he manages to walk up the steps
eventually he manages to press the elle hears the door buzzer
she is pale and underweight
she gets up walks to the apartment door
she presses the intercom button with trepidation
her mouth is dry
the crackle of electric silence
p a g e exasperated she takes her finger off the button turns away
the buzzer sounds again
elle curses and turns back to it
she hesitates and then presses the answer button
its uri tallow from the ministry
we spoke earlier
its hard to do this
it takes everything thats left of her
she presses the buzzer door release
the front door opening sound os
elle turns away from the door
she gathers herself
she looks at her apartment door
she steps backwards from it as if dreading what might be approaching it
eventually she is in the middle of the large open plan room staring at the door
a shadow is visible under the door
the on her door makes her jump
she gathers herself
she goes to the door
eventually she opens it
uri stands there
he smiles thinly extends a hand
as she takes it he looks at his hand
this hand killed her love
mrs pentane very good of you to see me like this
come in mister tallow
she wants anything but this dull little man in her apartment
he wipes his feet excessively over and over
she closes the door behind him
he looks around
p a g e lovely just lovely
this is yours
he goes to a piece of art hanging on the wall
he shrugs as if worthless
elle tries to hold it together
can i get you anything
no really im fine
he has trouble meeting her eyes
that unsettles her even more
here we are trapped inside a terrence rattigan three act
it sounds unnatural
wary of him in the extreme he gestures to a seat reluctantly
she sits down opposite him
her body language is pure defence
a delicate subject of course
he can see the unimaginable depth of her grief
uri gets some correspondence out of his briefcase
good old fashioned paper
nothing like it
he waves the sheets of paper around
she cant even react
firstly im so very sorry for your loss
i know the ministry has informed you that your husband mr nicholas
she puts her hand across her slightly swollen belly
p a g e shes pregnant
uri frowns slightly struggles
misses pentane the fact is that
she looks at him with exhausted beautiful eyes
the truth is misses pentane that
im here to tell you that
well this may not be what you want to hear but
he looks at her looks away
he cant meet her gaze
get the fuck out if youd kindly hurry
her phone bleeps a message alert
an isolated sound
misses pentane i
he cant speak
why did he come here
this is impossible
oh for god sake
she gets up stands walks away from him
the fact is that your husband did not die in the manner in which you have been told he died
as i alluded in my letter my email
she opens the door for him to leave
he wants to die
i cant do this now
he follows her to the door
his hands are shaking
misses pentane please hear me
more p a g e contd why did i come here today
well the truth is i believe you should have the facts
the facts are that
we believe your husband was wrongfully arrested and
she looks at him
a family walking in the hall outside the door draw her attention
a mother and her two sons
they smile at her
she tries to smile closes the door slightly
uri is almost hyperventilating by now
you need to get the hell away from me
misses pentane the fact is that your husband was subjected to rendition
not as you may have heard of it but in a form
she has to lean against the wall
whilst in this instance your husband wasnt transported abroad because of logistics
a whisper logistics
he was subjected here in the united kingdom to a process designed to get him to confess
uri feels his burnt tongue
boothy silk and parker observe
what we need to establish uri is whether having found out more p a g e contd that you had made a mistake you killed nicholas pentane deliberately or whether
his death was merely a product of of the processes to which he was being subjected
he was no longer any use
by that stage his body was his mind
he would never have been able to lead an ordinary life work have relationships
so you did the judicious thing and disposed of the suspect accordingly
elle stands by the door
he wants to help her
your husband was tortured misses pentane
his voice has an unnatural edge to it
it sounds weird
she starts to laugh hysterically
its all a joke
these are measures taken occasionally and in conditions of the utmost secrecy against certain suspects accused of terrorism im sure youre aware
she stops laughing
she stares at him tries to form words
her knees give out
he goes to her helps her
she pushes him away in panic
p a g e get out
another text message bleeps ludicrously from her phone
this isnt exactly what i came here to tell you misses
she leans again the wall
he shuts the door softly
he seems to reach a critical mass
emotion leaves him
what i came here to tell you today that it was me
i oversaw the torture and tortured your husband
it was under my ministrations
she is incredulous of the use of the word
it was me you see
i killed him
only so much
her world has become a nightmare
nothing is real
i know this is a lot to take in misses pentane
the words dont seem like hers what are you
uri almost smiles
little old me
as if in a dream she looks around searching for something
im calling the police
that wont help much today
but she dials
he grabs the phone from her with polite force
he puts then phone down like a star hotel receptionist
p a g e what the fuck do you think
get out now
she grabs the phone again and redials
he grabs the phone from her this time with slightly more force
she is pushed away
get the fuck out
but he just stands near her breathing
what do you want from me
he opens his arms slightly looks at her
the eyes of a child
he cant say it
cant say forgiveness cant say death
she suddenly grabs an ornament from the dresser near her
he drops to his knees
but she has swung and connected before he has spoken
he reels from the impact but she is weak with shock
piece of shit mould
she swings again stronger this time
the blow hurts him
this is what you fucking want
sobbing oh jesus
adrenaline kicks in
she starts to pound him with the ornament which breaks
then she grabs a stone stature and him with it
that sends him flying
he grovels on the carpet
p a g e motherfucker
she lays into him
he accepts it all
blow after bloody blow
yes blow yes blow yes blow
after a while she slows exhausted
piece of dogshit
she grabs her belly grimaces
uris face is now pulped
he means her belly her unborn child
she is sobbing broken exhausted
uri looks at booth silk and parker
coffee and digestives
i relieved him of his pain
elle gasps for breath stares at uri through tears
she drops the bloody stone statue
uri is badly injured now
am i expected to admire
leave me alone
she tries to open the door to haul him out
i dont want you to be
ill make up a story
beat actually i hate it all
beat i do as im told actually
p a g e she grabs the stone statue again and swings
primal she screams at him as she does it and now the statue uri is thrown sideways by the adrenal force of the blow
he falls on the expensive carpet barely conscious
he glimpses a white feather displayed as an ornament among other artefacts in a lit glass fronted display cabinet
elle drops the stone statue again stumbles away
uri begins to crawl towards the door
leaves a trail of blood
mums the word mrs pentane
ill take care of everything
he reaches the door grabs it with a bloody hand as we his face scarred uri sits among the instruments of torture
done thinking he suddenly snaps his rubber gloves on
better get to it
p a g e story jeremy bentham in urban winter darkness a hoodie walks down an alley
he uses the deep shadows to conceal himself
he scopes out the back of the houses he walks past as if looking for an opportunity
a radio advert ends over not that youll be needing one now that your house assurance is on the house
as the vo ends there is the sound of drinking glasses knocking together in a busy pub then an inane radio ad jingle then so welcome back and if youve
just joined us welcome im talking to chris marlow the barrister who represented decorated afghanistan para veteran shona barnes earlier this year
if you recall shona was sentenced to seven years in wormwood scrubs for the murder of caleb rounds the man who broke into her house shot and held her hostage
for several hours on the night of march the twelfth last year
in your opinion shonas post traumatic stress disorder a condition she suffered following action
an incident with an ied in helmand province in afghanistan in may two thousand and ten more p a g e contd an incident that killed a close colleague of
hers and resulted in shona being pensioned invalided out of the army
in your opinion chris this the ptsd should have been crucial to the decision not to prosecute shona for murder a charge you now feel should have been reduced to
she didnt seem like much of an invalid in the way she dealt with rounds did she
so for you was this a travesty of justice
my sense of it is christie as ive said and the reason i feel i failed really is that the state must find a way to take responsibility
the hoodie climbs over the back fence of a house
he then proceeds up the garden again hugging the shadows for cover
but now youre considering retiring
with a future as qc certain
a law lord perhaps
youre regarded by many as a laughs legal wunderkind
well i dont know about that
but yes im looking to move out of the legal profession now
because of this case specifically
as queens council you could help people like shona
lots of shonas
for me its this we send her out to afghanistan
we tell her to kill people who resisted our invasion
as the dj starts to speak but more p a g e contd anyway look we make her an expert
a killing machine
and then war breaks our machine
so then our machine needs post traumatic stress disorder drugs in order to function in normal life
to make a cup of tea for god sake
silence a beat then shes a broken child chrissie
we broke her
so then when she kills a known psychotic child molester and murderer in her home in the middle of the night in her home in self defence we the state
we call that murder and we throw her to the dogs
we screw her up in the name of a cause in some country some people and lets face it in a part of the world not many british people know
or give a damn about and then we finish the job
we prosecute her for murder and lock her up
the hoodie chooses a ground floor window
he jemmies it open
but ultimately the only alternative is that we dont have a professional a standing army
we rely on
i understand that when you sign up you take your chances
you become an organ of the state and if that state tells you to kill people in its name it chooses not to call that murder
it chooses then to call you a hero especially if you die
so these young people the soldiers who give their lives in the defence of our liberty more p a g e contd dont deserve the label hero
is that what youre saying
the hoodie climbs through the window he has jemmied open
nation states have always protected themselves from their own imperial absurdities
what would be left if there was no chance of glory
why would anyone sign up
look in war anywhere people do what they can to survive
all i can say is that personally i mean as shonas brief i failed to make the court see sense
for me you know its like you can murder in the so called defence of the state but if you kill in the defence of yourself
you know its like i mean as shakespeare said if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us
his voice dissolves and fades away as we shona s black is awoken by a sound the dull clunk of something giving under strain
she lifts her head up listens
another clunk but this followed by other sounds downstairs
shona is quickly out of bed standing
she moves in a way that suggests combat training with controlled power and assurance
she is not afraid
caleb s white breaks in through the kitchen window
hes young and hooded
his thin face is haunted by addiction
caleb climbs through the window he has just jemmied open
he stands in the kitchen a moment listening
he hears nothing
p a g e he starts to move quietly through the kitchen towards the caleb enters
he looks around sees the usual living room stuff a settee some ornaments a tv and ipod and ipod dock a shelf bearing a few ornaments ok but caleb wants
what caleb doesnt seem to see are the mantelpiece photos of corporal shona smiling with her para mates in afghanistan
caleb turns and heads towards the door
he goes out into the caleb emerges from the living room
a fist connects with his jaw sending him staggering
another two blows a fist and a kick
caleb sprawls and then manages to stand as shona attacks him
she moves fast and with focus a shape in the darkness moving very fast
caleb lashes out with his right fist
she lands another two punches to his neck and face
he yells and lashes out again
this time he connects with the side of her head
she goes sprawling
he dives towards her and pounds her with his fists
what the fuck easy peasy ho
she fights him the focussed power of a trained soldier but hes too strong and doesnt seem to feel blows that should be causing him a lot of pain
he punches her in the head twice
she goes still
caleb now pulls the silenced gun hes been trying to get his hands on throughout the fight from his jacket pocket
he stands gasping for breath
he aims the gun at her
i been had by a bitch
starts to laugh stand bitch
she just maintains her guard balled up on the floor
p a g e i said stand up
no way were gonna have chats with you sprawled
less you wanna fuck me now that is
she looks up at him
her evulsion is obvious
he gestures up with the gun
slowly carefully she stands
well shocky shocky shock
wasnt expecting quite such a welcome
shona could be a statue
what the fuck
caleb still points his gun at her
he looks at her
its christmas ho ho ho
keeping his gun on her caleb turns a lamp on
he sees her average height but athletic powerful attractive damaged
smile for the camera
you got names
he comes closer to her examines her but keeps his distance
she seems calm but he sees the storm beneath the surface
all fucked up now aint ya babe
who did this to ya
all that moves is her eyes she watches the gun nothing else
caleb moves the gun deliberately making her eyes move
notable lara fuckety croft
he moves the gun erratically
he cant outpace her eyes
game over well shit bitch aint you the self same night owl
i said whats your fuckin name
p a g e still her eyes on the gun
suddenly annoyed he he goes to hit her in the face with his gun but she ducks
he swings at her again and again she ducks
she assumes a combat position fists up body ready again
she looks at his eyes
well aint you the pocket battleship
we gonna have another swingers you an me
dont think so bitch
think you an me we gonna have chats get under each others skinny maybe get some cosy
fighting some inner battle she just waits for his next move
hes impressed but suddenly hes bored by this game
he aims the gun at her head
lets play the you kneeling on the floor now game
i liked you down there
she doesnt move yesterday bitch
he starts to squeeze the trigger
she doesnt move
he aims the gun at her left shoulder and the bullet nicks shoulder
its just a flesh wound but enough to shut her up and make her drop to her knees in agony
now we got some kind of understanding
some kind of parity goin down
he stands over her looks down at the booty
she grabs her left shoulder with her right hand and squeezes
the pain makes her cry out but she immediately bites her lip silent
now im more than more p a g e contd somewhat
dont know that i could take one like that
he looks away from her sees the photographs on the mantle shona the soldier with her squaddie buddies in afghanistan
well that explains

which makes me wonder actually wheres your stash
he looks at her waits
she grimaces in controlled agony
dont make me spell it out
you know why we in ere aving this

he throws her on it
the pain makes her wince
she muffles her scream with pride
she now knows he is psychotic

he points his gun at her head
she shakes her head no
what the fuck

he glances at the photographs again grins
you got that uniform still
i like a woman in uniform
she just looks at him through the fog of bloody agony
how come you so hot babes
you leave the central heating on all night to keep you snuggles
nothing like a man for that
p a g e he removes his jacket and then the hoodie he wears beneath it
she can see his prison tats and scars on his neck
she can see the injection marks on his dirty skinny forearms
hey what you lookin at

she wont meet his eyes
on her eyes in ecu the sounds of war until i said look at me you fuckin
he jabs the gun into her crotch leans close to her
she looks him in the eyes
she sees everything thats wrong

backing towards the door he looks and points his gun at her

p a g e he doesnt trust her but hes going to take a chance
he heads out of the room quickly and goes into the caleb goes through cupboards fast
not a move babes
searches cupboards where you keep the cake ho
me and victoria sponge were tight as a schoolgirls twat
going from cupboard to cupboard he sees the usual food and crockery etc
in one cupboard he sees bottle of prescription pills benzodiazepine diazepam and methylphenidate
a low whistle and i thought i was fucked up
what they do to you out there babes
turn you into a raghead
he grabs a bottle of benzodiazepine and goes back into the reading the bottle label he doesnt notice that she has gone for a brief moment
but when he does he throws the bottle aside and starts moving
he runs out of the room and heads caleb runs up the stairs onto the landing his gun up
hey fuck bitch
he hears a noise from the he runs in sees her trying to make a call on her mobile
with his peripheral vision and for the briefest moment he sees a white feather on the dresser beside her bed
without stopping he rushes her as she desperately thumbs the buttons
he smashes the phone from her hand and shoves her
but she manages to keep on her feet and run out of the room
he p a g e the bullet thuds into the wall by her as she sprints onto the shona emerges from the bedroom and rushes down the stairs her left
hand holding her wounded and bleeding right shoulder
come here you fuckin slag
caleb runs down the stairs after her
shona sprints full speed into the she goes to a drawer rips it open
she grabs a knife and turns to face him just as he reaches her
his face contorted he crams his gun into her face as she slashes at him caleb staggers backwards his face pouring blood
fucking slippery bitch
caleb points the gun at her
he indicates drop the knife with the gun while he holds his cut bleeding face
she puts the knife down
her eyes never leave his gun

shocked by the cut on his face he aims his gun at her head
she means shoot her

his finger squeezes the tighter and tighter
the trigger starts to move
but then she he stops thrown by her smile
what the fuck
no one smiles at caleb
she still smiles at him

he shoves the gun at her
but she keeps smiling

he lunges at her swipes with the gun
she lashes out at him with her fist hits his face
he staggers backwards
hes had enough
he aims the gun at her head again sure and steady

she stops smiling
she drops her guard stands very still waiting
the bleeding gunshot wound in her shoulder is draining the life from her
they look at each other a moment breathing hard
she looks away from him disgusted
p a g e thats what i thought
so now what we gonna do is you gonna make me a sarnie
she doesnt move go
she holds his eyes defiantly and then she moves
caleb eats a cheese sandwich
his gun is on the kitchen table near his right hand
shona sits opposite him shes in bad shape he shoulder wound is pulling her down fast
she holds a kitchen towel against it which is soaked in dark red blood
caleb watches her
solider girl needs a hospital

she closes her eyes
on shona sounds of an explosion shouting and shona screaming sandy
followed by automatic weapons firing
this builds until shonas eyes suddenly open
strangely calm i need a doctor
he breaks down in a fit of laughter
she needs a doctor

he laughs again and then suddenly goes very serious

she fights for control
shes losing the battle
caleb suddenly stands pushing the chair back
the sudden sound of the chair scraping on the floor makes her start
oh for fucks sake
he goes to the medicine cupboard gets her drugs out
p a g e what do ya need
he grabs various drugs and dumps them on the table in front of her
then fills a glass with tap water and gives her that
get fixed up babes i aint got all night
she doesnt move
irritated he pours dozens of pills from various bottles out savagely and crams them into her mouth
he then forces the glass of water to her lips and makes her take the pills
she gasps for air
he stands over her
he knew she would

laughs fuckin what
ill leave when its time to leave babes
first is you gonna show me some hospitable time just the two of us

he caresses her cheek with his gun

he grabs her right hand and puts it on his crotch
p a g e the drug od begins to win the war inside shona
slow and steady wins the race babes
we take it easy steps

she jerks her hand away

he grabs her by the hair starts forcing her head towards his crotch
with his gun hand he starts to unzip his fly
an me been so fuckin la de dah with ya and now this

as he goes to pull his pecker out she stands
as if shes had enough of the game she looks at him like a bug dead already
sit the fuck
lightning fast she pounds her index and first fingers into his eyes blinding him
at the same time she snap punches his throat collapsing his oesophagus completely
in less than a second caleb goes from being in charge to being a grovelling screaming piece of crap on the floor at her feet
but now he his gun wildly up at her anywhere
succumbing to the drugs she dodges as the bullets thud into the walls and furnature
she kicks at his gun hand
its inaccurate because now the drugs are overwhelming her
he keeps hold of the gun screaming and gasping for breath he will never draw again
a bullet slams into the wall beside her
reluctantly she forces herself to focus to hold the drugs back as she p a g e the back of his neck with the side of her fist
a loud caleb stops moving instantly dead
shona stands there breathing hard trying to focus
and then slowly surely the tears come
the drugs win
a radio ad over male i should cocoa betty
female me too bill
the sounds of polite kissing and an inane radio ad jingle as shona collapses
as she loses consciousness blackness and the sound of distant hallucinatory police sirens as we the radio ad jingle and bullshit fades to silence as a year later shona sits
looking at camera
she is handcuffed
her face bears the scars
her eyes in ecu they are dark damaged strong and sad
she is searching for our affirmation
