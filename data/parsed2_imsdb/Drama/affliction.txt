rolfe whitehouses voice thirtiesh articulate speaks over credit tableaus this is the story of my older brothers strange criminal behavior and disappearance
we who loved him no longer speak of wade
its as if he never existed
by telling his story like this as his brother i separate myself from his family and those who loved him
everything of importance that is everything that gives rise to the telling of this story occurred during a single deer hunting season in a small town in upstate new hampshire
where wade was raised and so was i
one night something changed and my relation to wades story was different from what it had been since childhood
i mark this change by wades tone of voice during a phone call two nights after halloween
something i had not heard before
let us imagine that around eight oclock on halloween eve speeding past tobys route comes a pale green eight year old ford fairlane with a police bubble on top
a square faced man wearing a troopers cap is driving the vehicle
beside him sits a child a little girl with a plastic tiger mask covering her face
the man is driving fast route tableau dissolves to night
a pale green police ford fairlane drives past
wade whitehouse driving sits beside jill his daughter ten years old wearing a black and yellow tiger plastic mask
im sorry for the screw up

i couldnt help it i had to stop at pennys for the costume
and you were hungry remember
whos fault is it then if its not yours

wade grimaces holds his jaw
the fairlane swerves around broken pumpkins under a caution light
why do they do that

where do you get this stuff
from your mother
she doesnt talk about you anymore
wade looks at her wanting to lift her mask see her face
the fairlane approaches town hall a square two story building on the north side of the common
exhaust billows from idling cars as parents and children come and go
clowns tramps angels and vampires fill the brightly lit room
parents watch from the walls as gordon lariviere a beefy fiftiesh man with a silver flat top announces the costume contest
wade nods to various townspeople
were looking for the funniest costume
and the scariest
and the most imaginative
and the best costume of all
nudges jill got here just in time

jill steps forward retreats
wade looks at her flaxen hair her blue sneakers protruding from her pathetic costume
his heart aches he loves her so

a fairy godmother with a wand beams while nearby a hobo writhes in his mothers grip a hard loser
wade looks for jill first among the winners then among the losers shes nowhere to be found
he heads toward a hall leading to the restrooms
jill stands alone in the corner next to the pay phone tiny forlorn
wade realizes at once he was wrong to leave her before she had found a friend

wade whitehouse stalks out
wade steps outside notices jack hewitt and his kewpie doll girlfriend hettie sitting in the cab of his double parked pickup sharing a joint talking to lacoy alongside

wade looks up to the window where jill waits walks around the front of the truck gets in
jacks high bodied pickup growls in low gear as it drives past merritts shell station toward saddleback ridge
jack lowers the radio as wade asks him about deer season hettie leans forward to hear the music

jack brakes wheels the x around heads back to town
most parents have left or are leaving with their costumed children
hewitts burgundy pickup breaks alongside the audi
wade swings open the passenger door jumps to the ground lillian
lillian attractive in an ankle length hooded coat
whatever pose wade strikes she strikes the opposite
her dress and demeanor set her apart
me and jill we just had a little spat
she felt kind of left out i guess from not knowing some of the new kids where is she now
is she in the truck with your friends
jack and hettie neck inside the cab
she told me she wanted to wait for you
jill at the window in her tiger mask
lillian waves jill motions shell be down

horner lillians new husband thin with thinning hair and a tyrolean hat sees jill at the entrance and heads toward her
leave her be
thiss got nothing to do with you so just act like the chauffeur
nobody wants any trouble
horner greets jill walks her to the silver audi
passing parents listening give wade a wide berth
i dont want her to go lillian
dont cause a scene
no ones trying to win any rounds
dont make it any worse
im not making it any worse
me and jill couldve worked this thing out
its normal its even normal for me to get a little touchy about it
believe it or not
how do you think this makes me look treating her like some tragic victim or something
horner opens the car door for jill shuts it
wade shoves him just wait till were through goddamnit
horners hat falls
lillian icy stares at wade
he backs off
wade sometimes wonders howd lillian pittman of lawford n
get so much class
dont you say a word
i didnt hit him
im not going to hit anybody
horner sits behind the wheel
lillian silently stares wade up and down gets in the car beside jill
the automatic locks latch as the audi drives away
its taillights merge with vanishing traffic
wade looks down picks up horners dark green tyrolean hat examines it as if unsure of its function
wade walks toward town hall
margie fogg exiting greets him new hat
no answer jills up i see
vague for a while
hows she doing

nick wickham margs boss passes by like hell you are

wade lost in thought continues toward town hall
at the door lariviere one of the last to leave eyes him
wade tosses horners hat inside
watch this snow
its coming down tonight
wade nods as he lights a cigarette
alone he watches the last cars pull out
he holds his jaw
pre dawn light silhouettes a dozen weather beaten mobile homes set off route
snow continues to fall
a sheet of white stretches down parker mountain
a clock radio pierces the silence with classic rock
wade whitehouse rolls over runs his tongue across mossy teeth shuts off the music
he looks out the window grunts shit
he steps over to the phone by the frayed plaid couch dials
wades trailer is surprisingly neat considering its owner smokes too much drinks too much eats take out and rarely cleans up
on phone lugene
fumbles for cigarette look i was wondering with the snow and all if you got school today
lights cigarette how the hell do i know
youre the principal
all im supposed to do is direct traffic from to

i was just hoping youd have called school off
beat you check the weather bureau
acquiesces okay i hear you
ill be over in a bit
hangs up jack hewitts x passes wades trailer continues up
tire chains splice the path
jack behind the wheel
beside him evan twombley fleshy irish wearing brand new scarlet wool pants jacket and cap
he feeds on the misfortunes of others
its not enough snow not for tracking the bastards
no advantage there kid
dont worry mr
twombley i know where those suckers are
rain or shine snow or no snow
i know deer
well kill us a buck today
right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles
the bucks are right behind them and were right behind the bucks
gestures to gun rack this gun gets fired before ten oclock
whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you
ill put you inside yards of a buck the first four hours of the season
thats what youre paying me for aint it
hewitt looks at twombleys rifle a winchester m pump action custom carved stock and not a scratch on it
never fired at least not by twombley
done much shooting with that rifle yet
eyes him tell you what
you get me close to a big buck by ten kid theres another hundred bucks in it
if you get it
you might not kill it
you think so
you might gut shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag
cant guarantee that wont happen especially with a new gun
i may have to shoot it
you take care of your end kid ill take care of mine
you understand what im saying
i want a deer a dead one not a cripple or whatthefuck
i get it
disdain no sweat
youll get yourself a deer and youll get him dead
and youll have him by coffee time
and youll get your extra hundred bucks
the pickup disappears behind a curve of pine and spruce trees
wade whitehouse wearing a reflective vest waves a district school bus into the parking lot
noisy jostling grade schoolers emerge from the bus
jills former classmates
straight as a statue wade holds back traffic
cars and trucks are backed up on the unplowed road
horns honk and bleat a womans voice yells whitehouse we aint got all day
wade daydreaming seems oblivious to the commotion
oblivious or just plum contrary
a shiny black bmw approaches speeding passing traffic on the shoulder
a man and a woman in a fur coat sit in front two children in back
whitehouse waves for it to stop
the bmw accelerates through the intersection ignoring wade and the traffic
it whizzes past spinning wade and is quickly up the road spewing ice and exhaust
wade slips to one knee
honking ensues every car goes where it wishes
wade brushing off snow follows the last bus as it pulls in
lugene brooks school principal rushes over are you okay wade
what was wrong
why were you holding everyone up
did you see that sonofabitch in the bmw
he couldve killed somebody
did you get his number
i know who it is
i still dont understand from boston
evan twombleys son in law he was driving
i know where theyre headed
up the lake agaway
the old mans out deer hunting with jack hewitt so they probably got some big weekend party planned
wade sets his face thinking
snowprints lead from jacks pickup to where he and twombley walk guns pointed skyward
they enter a line of trees
jack watches twombley walk ahead of him wrapped like a huge infant in red bunting crunching twigs underfoot
he looks from side to side checks his gun returns to watching twombley
twombley nods slips thumps to the ground
his rifle lands silently
jack sprints over helps him up safety latches the winchester
hands it back
well cross the next meadow
jack finds a path one eye on twombley i used to play ball
drafted by the red sox
you played for the sox
best ballplayer to come out of new hampshire since carlton fisk
the only difference between me and that clemens on tv is luck shit luck
ruined my arm
brought me along too fast
whyd it have to be my fucking arm i used to think
then i realized it had to be somebodys fucking arm
jack waits for twombley as they enter a meadow
jack aims his rifle at twombley as he approaches
slow the fuck down
jack aims away following an imaginary bird
twombley steps alongside
walking loudly suns gettin high
fingers to lips deers have ears too
milky sky flatters lariviere co
a sprawl of well digging septic and snow plow equipment
billboard declaimes lariviere co
our business is going in the hole
a motto repeated on every truck and piece of equipment
wades green fairlane is parked outside the office
wade puffing a cigarette passes elaines lariviere secretary desk her large red no smoking sign eases into an office modum chair
he unzips his jacket slaps his cap against his thigh spraying drops of melted snow
gordon lariviere speaking on the phone past a glass partition calls to wade told you the snow was coming down
take the grader
wheres the plow
jimmy took it
jacks out hunting with evan twombley
his son in law damn near killed me

dont let lillian get to you
she didnt belong here
thats why she left
thats what i love about a small town
you know everybody
wade exits toward the blue grader
jack and twombley walk through fresh snow
the hillsides thick with pine trees
twombley red faced puffing leans to speak to hewitt
jack lifts a finger to his lips stay here stand where i am
twombley peers over a slight cliff at a lumber trail twenty feet below
jack points fresh tracks
sniffs deer shit
heres your buck mr
ill circle around
you only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks
jack zig zags down the incline while twombley gun poised waddles along the edge
jack stops fifty feet away watches twombley a cartoon character
a stag pokes his nose through the pines steps into a clearing
jack aims his rifle looks at twombley
twombley turns to see the buck loses his footing tumbles down the twenty foot cliff
an open cab grader our business is going in the hole sits in the rutted lot outside tobys a beer joint with fake wood siding and hour neon sign
a four wheel drive plow with the lariviere motto pulls in parks beside the blue grader
jimmy dame gets out glances at the grader as he enters
jimmy joins wade at the bar calls for a beer
frankie lacoy bullshits with two long haired locals at a nearby table their conversation drifts in and out
country music plays through a broken juke box speaker
wade touches his tooth grimaces
hows it goin
how you think
sorry about that
whys it every year come first snow you get stuck with the grader
lights cigarette i gotta quit these things
what we doing after
wade nods dont work too fast
business the way it is gordons probably looking to lay me off earlier than usual this year
hes got too much money as it is
whys it always the little guy that gets kicked in the butt in hard times
lacoys conversation has caught his ear
he turns to watch
that was no pisser
ill tell you who was a pisser
there was a real pisser
he was mean normal but when he drank it was like he burst on fire
always drank cc
one christmas theres this cord of wood out back he forgot about and he decides to have his two boys stack it
except its been out back two months and its snowed and rained and froze so now the woods all iced in
he takes the boys
he was drunk of course
wades face as the story comes to life thirty years before
glen whitehouse pop pushes his boys wade and rolfe toward snow covered lumps of firewood behind the barn
the boys carry shovels and a pickaxe
daylight in the swamps
pop the kids are waiting for us
a lesson in work and its rewards
youll thank me for this one day
to house sally turn off that tv
his sons chip at the wood
to rolfe just do it
lets go back
wade notices his mother sally watching from the window
what are you a quitter
lacoy roars with laughter
puzzled so what happened
thats all i heard
wade would know more about it
we were just talking about your old man
what are you a quitter
wade grabs his keys walks over
jesus lacoy you got nothing better to do than sit around and tell stories
pity is some college student will come some day and believe this shit cause youre the only one dumb enough to talk to him
wade and jimmy head out
wade shivering in the open grader plows a narrow winding road
he lights a cigarette exhales steamy smoke
lacoys laugh triggers a memory the flashback continues glen whitehouse pushes his sons inside
sally steps from sight
out back the firewood lies frozen amid futile shovel marks
that was some job
well work at it everyday promise
i think we made the point
mumbles you just needed a drink
pop swigging canadian club turns what was that
no answer you got something to say say it
you no good pup
rolfe runs from the room screaming mom
the towns hour restaurant
a bright new sign reads home made cooking
wades grader out front
wade eating lunch at the counter talks with nick wickham it dont look right
it looks like its spelled wrong or something
its people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering
whatever somebody does to improve things around here you gotta find fault with it
im not finding fault
its a good idea good for you good for the town

this town sucks
aw cmon i was only saying theres something wrong with home made cooking thats all

lariviere grunts disapproval as wade slips the butt out his window
he more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something
thats what usually happens
i shoulda sent you instead of jack

you aint the hunter jack is
and he cant drive the grader worth shit

wade pulls behind three state trooper cars
jack stands joking with the troopers one of whom holds a german shepherd on a leash

youre not making any sense man
they walk over to jacks burgundy pickup
wade eyes the rifles in the gun rack
theres your old twenty gauge and that theres the new browning you was showing me last night
this must be twombleys gun
very fancy tooling
probably fired one time
its a beautiful piece of work
touches it but what the hell jack i guess you deserve it
starts engine yeah
twombley sure as hell wont be shooting it again
he sure as hell wont
wade whitehouse lying in bed with an icepack on his cheek talks on the phone rolfe
yeah brother look i was calling cause has there been anything on tv in boston about a hunting accident with a guy named twombley evan twombley
there was something
it happened up your way
yeah i know him the kid that was with him
maybe you do too
he works for lariviere with me

wade its late
i know youre probably at tobys but im in bed reading
we got different habits
no not tonight
im in bed too
im calling because i need you to listen
youre supposed to be a smart guy
youre a professor
i got this theory
jack says he didnt see twombley shot but he did
wades theory in black and white twombleys footing slips
jack turns to watch
twombleys gun hits frozen rocks fires blows a hole through his chest
itll come out jack lied and the kidll get hung for it
he was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in new england and the construction business
you think jack shot him
well it was an accident
they were out deer hunting right
jack probably heard the gun go off then came back and found the body
another theory black and white
jack sees a figure run from twombleys body
wade shifts the phone from ear to ear lillian was here
the night before the shooting
how was she
picked up jill
she was supposed to visit for the weekend for halloween
she wanted to go home
i was thinking of getting a lawyer

i get to feeling like a whipped dog some days rolfe and some night im going to bite back

no no i havent
ive growled a little but i havent bit
sound of gunshot
wades bubble top fairlane drives through snow covered hills
the fairlane is parked outside a substantial summer house with a wide porch and frozen pond
the speeding bmw in the drive
wade knocks on the front door
an year old boy answers the door
wade speaks the boy goes back inside
gordon delicate beautiful wearing a dark green robe comes to the door
her eyes are red rimmed
wade has seen her before but not this close
he feels awkward

i just had a little business to settle with mr
im the local police officer
something about my father
no its a
its a traffic thing
no big deal
cant it wait then
mel gordon dark eyed wearing a tartan robe steps behind his wife
next time phone ahead
mel folds his arms
his wife goes inside
i said next time phone ahead
gordon when i come all the way to serve somebody a summons i dont call ahead for an appointment
what the hell are you talking about
im issuing you a ticket
i just got out of bed and youre telling me youre giving me a goddamn speeding ticket
are you nuts
is that it whitehouse
writing yesterday morning you passed a stopped school bus which was flashing its lights then you stops wades arm hold on
wrenches hand free dont ever put your hands on me mr
youre talking about a goddamned ticket from when i passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or
dont give me a hard time mr
im just doing your fucking job
i watch television too
heres your ticket
refusing ticket you get the hell out of my house now asshole
and know this you are going to be a lucky asshole if i havent got you fired before the day is out
i can do it with one phone call and im pissed enough to do it now
mel gordon moves wade out of the door slams it
wade steps away looks back at the house
gordon watches him from the window
a wood frame house off the main drag
wade and margie post coital jacks sort of sensitive i guess
more than most
but hell be okay in a few weeks
theres something funny about that shooting
theres lots funny about it actually
i heard he was drunk at tobys last night and got in a fight with hettie
he drove off without her
im sure im positive it didnt happen the way jack says it did
jacks turned into one of those men who are permanently angry
he used to be a sweet kid but its like when he found out he couldnt play ball anymore he changed
now hes like everyone else
ive been wondering if maybe jack shot twombley instead of twombley shooting himself
ive been wondering maybe jack shot him on purpose
how can you even think such a thing
why would jack hewitt do that shoot twombley on purpose
black and white
a further theory jack bends over the fallen twombley holds a tarp to protect his chest from blood spray
he shoots twombley with his own gun
jack doesnt need money
everybody needs money
except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch son in law of his
people like that
jack wouldnt kill for it
besides who would pay him
lots of people
guy like evan twombley boston union official probably got lots of people want to see him dead
the governments been investigating his links with the mafia
laughs the mafia hire jack hewitt
no i just know jacks lying about what happened
he just seemed i know that kid what hes like inside
hes a lot like i was at his age
you wouldnt have done anything like that shot someone for money
not for money
but if somebodyd given me half a damned excuse i was pretty fucked up you know
smiles but not now
wade sits on the edge of the bed sighs
lapses into thought
margie caresses his back kisses it
when you gonna get that tooth fixed
wade looks at her brushes the hair off her face i can see what you looked like as a kid
you knew me as a kid
yeah but never what you looked like
never really studied your face like now
i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now this way
after making love
i like it
its nice to see that in a grown up person
wade walks naked to the kitchen returns with two beers one for marg
he gets in bed
she thinking sips dont you think do you still think its a good idea to press this custody thing just now
im her father supposed to be but im not able to
yes i am
it may be the only thing in my life ive been so clear about wanting
even if it takes a big fight
i guess you have to
silence theres another thing ive been thinking about
i dont know how you feel about the idea margie because weve never talked about it
but ive been thinking lately ive been thinking we should get married sometime
you and me
uncertain oh wade
ive been thinking about it thats all
youve been married twice it was to the same woman
i was just a kid
marg looks its not like a marriage proposal or anything just a thought
something for you and me to talk about and think about
ill think about it
he kisses her
his jaw winces in pain
glen whitehouse plastered yells at wade age ive got sons goddamnit oh my god have i got sons
you love me boys
do you love your pop
of course you do
wade frightened retreats as sally enters in her housecoat
glen stop oh jesus sally you are such a goddamned good person
you are so much better than i am i who am no good at all you who are a truly good person like a fucking saint
beyond fucking com pare
glen reaches for the canadian club sally tries to block his hand
glen pulls his arm from hers clipping her cheek with the bottle
sally gasps grabs her cheek
wade pushes between them protecting his mother
my big boy bursting out of the seams of his jeans
pop clenches his fist
wade vainly looks rolfes direction for help
you little prick
pops fist comes crashing down
wade raises his arms to protect himself
wades arm bone cracks with the blow
wade grimaces in pain
margie gets into wades idling ford
wade washed and changed drives marg sits beside him
they head north
deer rifles echo from the woods
did you tell them
no answer that we were coming
dont you think its proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents
i know your parents
i just want to pick up my divorce papers
for the lawyer
it wont take long
sun slants over parker mountain they pull up
the house once white is peeling
polyurethane flaps over dark windows
the red ford pickup sits long frozen in the open barn
getting out are you sure theyre home
did you call
the trucks here
looks like theyve stayed inside since the snow started
they stamp their feet on the porch wade turns the knob
it seems abandoned
think theyre alright
i wouldve heard
i dont know for christs sake
they round the house try the back door
wade knocks loudly
glen whitehouse opens the door stands inside
he wears long underwear stained woolen trousers slippers
pop pop you okay
glen shuffles toward the stove they follow
he starts a fire
jesus pop how can you stand the cold dressed like that
you remember margie fogg
been a while
like some coffee
how you and ma doing
havent seen you in town for a while
your mas sleeping
you want me to get her
pop goes to the bedroom
to marg jesus
nothings changed around here
have you been heating the house
not just with the stove
theres a furnace
youre not using it today
its broke i guess
theres an electric in the bedroom
maybe wade should take a look at it
your pipesll freeze
pop nods wade would you do that
wade concerned pushes open the bedroom door ma
can i come in
he steps inside
on the bed sally whitehouse wrapped in blankets lies dead
he walks over beside the small electric heater touches her forehead
her skin is chalk white
margie steps into the doorway
pop joins coffees perked
when did she die
shes dead then
i checked on her
she had the electric heater
cold dont bother her as much as me
which is why i give her the heater
kneels over mother is there something wrong with the phone
in the living room
why didnt you call and have the furnace fixed
i thought she was alright
till this morning she was
pop goes to the dresser pours himself canadian club
wade opens his mothers mouth attempts respiration
it makes me sad
sits makes me sad it was her
instead of me
i shoulda froze
rolfe whitehouse drives his four door toyota west through massachusetts toward new hampshire
his face bespeaks tolerance objectivity in short education
its also wades face
wade called me as usual late at night
i knew it was wade no one else calls me at that hour and i was ready to listen to another chapter in one of his ongoing sagas
there was the detective story concerning the shooting of evan twombley and the family melodrama about wades custody fight with lillian
but not this time
rolfes toyota sits with other cars
wade was telling a different story or so it seemed then one in which i myself was a character
he had called to tell me that sometime the previous night our mother had died and he had discovered the body when hed gone over to visit her and our
father with margie fogg
pop was okay but kind of out of it
worse than usual maybe though no drunker than usual
friends and relatives gather in the living room wade rolfe glen lariviere margie an aging couple reverend doughty thin wearing glasses and an avocado green suit
finishing a beer shouldnt we get this show on the road now that rolfes here
no one moves
lariviere checks his watch
wade shrugs pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do i guess
what about jill
is lillian bringing her
margies face tells rolfe hes touched on a sensitive subject
theyll be at the church and the cemetery
wade opens the frig takes out another beer anyone else want one
i dont drink
how you holding up wade
im fine fine
rolfe nods i remember you from high school
youre a teacher now
i havent seen you around
i dont suppose theres much reason for you to come this way
doughty calls for glen whitehouse who has been sitting silent drinking to join the others come glen join us
lets kneel for a moment of prayer before the service
wade expressionless looks at rolfe
rolfe embarrassed trying to do the right thing helps his father kneel beside rev
the others join the circle
this is nuts
dear heavenly father lord of hosts we come to thee to beseech thy blessings and commend to you the soul of our beloved wife and mother sally whitehouse to be
one with you and walk with you pop mutters something
wade rolfe and marg exchange glances
he mutters louder goddamned hair on her head
he rises over lariviere turns exclaims not a one of you is worth a goddamned hair on that good womans head
dont do this now pop
pop knocks back a drink as the others stand
maybe ill head on over to the church
this is a difficult time
gordon and the couple file out
doughty glen rolfe wade and margie remain
listen its no big deal pop
raising fists come on smart guy
tell how its no big deal
tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that womans head
give up this demon
go fuck yourself
wade eyes blazing squares off
son to father
wade just leave it
mocking listen to your little brother
wade just leave it
all of you
thats what ive got for children
wade just leave it
praise the lord
just leave it
pop cocks his fist
marg screaming jumps between them as pop swings
the old man bounces blows off margies arms and shoulders
wade pushes marg aside grabs his father in a bear hug and walks him backwards flat against the wall
wade releases him
pop frail collapses to the floor
wade kneels over him if you ever touch her again ill kill you
i swear it
townspeople and friends cluster around the gravesite pop lariviere jack and hettie lacoy chub merritt nick jimmy lillian jill and horner rolfe wade and margie
the day of the funeral was almost springlike
the snowline crossed new hampshire west to east retreating northward to concord where it melted by midmorning
the mourners exchange farewells
wade looks at lillian
margie and rolfe escorting wades father let him be
he walks over hugs jill
to lillian im glad youre here
can you stay for a while
lillian hesitates shakes her head no
you ever come to your fathers grave anymore
no not anymore
its too far
we should talk
weve done all our talking wade
let the past be
beat im sorry about your mother
i liked her
you never know how much women like that suffer
its like they live their lives with the sound turned off and then theyre gone
tugging at lillian mom
she has an ice skating lesson at four
im taking ice skating daddy
he kisses jill says goodbyes walks back to rolfe and margie
ahead lariviere walks with jack
wade and rolfe leave margie and pop in the kitchen as they step out back
lets dig out pops truck before the skin of the snow freezes up
they grab snow shovels propped against the porch walk to the barn
firewoods stacked alongside
shafts of light filter through the ramshackle structure
a snow drift nearly buries glens red truck
wade and rolfe break away the packed snow
what about margie
what about her
well do you still plan to get married
shell probably quit her job and stay out here with pop
we cant leave him alone here hell set the damn place on fire
with jill here a lot itll be good to have margie around
things are going to change in that department by the way
i got a custody lawyer in concord
im gonna see him tomorrow
all hells gonna break loose but its worth it
they finish clearing the snow
wade gets in the truck starts the engine
rolfe waits for wade
i want to let the gas run out
i dont want the bastard driving drunk and hes always drunk now
after well hide the keys
anything new about the shooting
reluctant i guess it was an accident like everybody thinks
want to know what i think happened
wade opens the glove compartment finds a bottle of canadian club
he unscrews the cap
find them everywhere
swigs i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one
that it wasnt an accident
then who shot him
well your friend i think
you gotta have a motive
whod pay him that kind of money
not the mob
they got their own guys
agreeing they wouldnt deal with a guy like jack
who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead
swigs i dont know
you tell me
its likely there are people in the union who dont want twombley to testify
they probably include his son in law whos vice president and will probably be the next president
i read that in the papers
whats his name mel gordon
yeah the guy with the bmw i told you about
i did didnt i
heres my theory
twombley unaware of illegal union loans or whatever starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out
finds out his son in law is involved
so mel gordon wouldnt want a professional hit
thatd make the feds dig deeper
he wants an accident
a hunting accident is perfect
shit around here you shoot somebody in the woods you say it was an accident you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted
jacks probably saying the guy shot himself cause he aint got his deer yet and dont want his license pulled
the truck sputters stops
wade pulls the keys
its too neat
things aint that neat
it makes me mad
that somebody can pay to kill somebody his own father in law and not be punished for it
dont that piss you off
rights right goddamnit
dont you care whats right
i care about what happened
im a student of history remember
the sun is down
wade tucks the keys in a knotted board
i was thinking about that story you told me about pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after
i hate to disappoint you but i dont think it happened
of course it happened
why would i lie about it
it may have happened but not the way you said
you think i wouldnt remember a thing like that
it wasnt me
i wasnt there but i heard about it
when i heard about it it was about elbourne
wed have to go digging in vietnam to ask him
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft
laughs well i never heard that one
i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop
i was a careful child and i became a careful adult but at least i wasnt afflicted by that mans violence
laughs again thats what you think
rolfe looks out the cobalt sky has turned black
i gotta head back
its a long drive
they walk toward the house
wade walks in as jack and jimmy prepare to head out their drilling rig loaded with pipe
gordon yells at jack put out that fucking cigarette
jack opens the truck ashtray
not there asshole
hewitt trudges to the john
lariviere smiles goes to his office as wade hangs his coat in his locker
jack cruises over
im fucking out of here
out of this fucking job
this job sucks
working outside in the winter sucks
jack gets in the cab of the drilling truck
open the door will ya
why dont you quit now you want out so bad
open the door
i mean it you got enough money now
head out for california
surfs up jack and youre digging wells in the snow
what do you mean i got money
im as broke as you
wade grins goes to activate the door
looney tunes jack
fucking looney tunes
the drilling truck pulls out the garage onto the road
from the opposite direction a black bmw slows enters
wade all eyes and ears watches
mel gordon parks in front of the office gets out
elaine calls mr
the boss in
wade flips the door switch
mel gordon and lariviere talk
the south main street office of j
battle hand lawyer
concord is a real town with traffic stores people with places to go
battle hand sits in a wheel chair behind his desk
wade uncomfortable in work clothes tries not to show it
i screwed up the divorce
i agreed with everything she said
i wanted her to like me
i just want to be a good father
it would help if you were married if there was someone at home while you work
i plan to
it would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex wife
sexual problems upsetting to the child
it looks pretty hopeless dont it
no not exactly
ill look at the divorce decree see if we can get it redrawn
interview your daughter
ill need a retainer
you can mail it
how much will the whole thing cost
hard to say
if we go for custody depositions psychiatric evaluations it could drag on
ten or twelve thousand dollars
she could win on appeal
if we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn assuming theyre unduly restrictive it wouldnt be more than twenty five hundred
sensing situation you might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the yeah
the custody suit thing was just my getting back at her
im not as dumb as i look
whatever you say
i love my daughter
hand nods ill send you the five hundred
wade stands hand motors to the door
wade puts his fingers in his mouth
his tooth throbs
fairlane squad car in its customary spot
wade and gordon speak
lariviere is relaxed open a new gordon
sorry about the long lunch
my clutch is going out again
you ever think of getting a new car wade
on what you pay me
call chub meritt and have him pick up wades car fix the clutch
to wade use the pickup
ill bill it to the town
youre the town police officer and the town police officer should have a decent car
you want a new car or not
what do i have to do for it
nothing wade ive been thinking
you dont get enough appreciation around here and its time we changed things a little
i saw mel gordon in here this morning
he say anything about the summons i tried to give him
sonofabitch wouldnt accept it
wade that wasnt smart
going out right after the mans father in law shot himself
let it go
call it a favor to me
mels doing some business with me
its nice to do favors for people you do business with
he was in a hurry
no big deal
that was before twombley was shot
before he knew
whats the difference
take my truck take a rest stop worrying about mel gordon
have you decided what to do with your old mans place he going to stay there
takes out cigarette want to buy
dont light that in here
you and mel gordon
voice rising always count on old wade for a good screwing
why should i always pay more sell cheap
why should you guys make all the money
you and mel and jack
wade pulls out bic lights cigarette
waving arms out
wade smiles exits
wade driving gordons x with running lights and roll bar takes toward pops farm
a pickup passes him jack hewitts burgundy ford
jack turns up parker mountain the road to the accident scene
wade turns and follows
jacks fresh tracks lead the way
hewitt is driving fast
wade keeps up
jack far ahead approaches the accident scene
night has fallen
wade comes over a low rise spots jacks pickup
he kills the lights parks to block jacks exit
footsteps in the snow
wade watches listens
whats he doing
looking for evidence
the burgundy pickup engine suddenly roars jacks back and at the wheel the tires squeal spit snow as he spins past wade
wade starts his engine gives pursuit
the pickups gun their engines bumper to bumper down mountain roads lumber roads rocky trails
wild headlamps their only guide
a trail turns sharply past a shallow beaver pond too sharply for jack
he crashes through a stand of skinny birches straight out onto the pond
the pickups momentum carries it across the pond
wade drops into first gear follows his headlights reflecting ice
he drives directly to jack bumper to bumper headlight to headlight
jack sticks his head out you crazy sonofabitch
youll sink us both
get off the fucking ice
wade doesnt budge
jack backs away wade inches forward
trees behind him
neither truck has traction on ice
jack steps out swinging his fists wildly
wade gets out
jacks grabs his rifle points it ill shoot you wade i swear it
ill fucking shoot you dead if you dont move away from that truck
wade backs off
ill shoot you dead if you move
jack gets back in his pickup maneuvers it slowly around the dodge crosses the ice and is gone
wade stands in darkness
the only sound his idling truck the wind
then a third sound the snap of ice
ice cracks ripple from the middle of the pond
ice planes tip around the truck
larivieres snazzy dodge slips descends disappears
headlights glow under water then go out
our business is going in the hole
wade alone in darkness plops into the water paddles to shore
freezing he finds jacks tire tracks in the snow
he bangs his jaw
a car drops wade off
home made cooking
wade enters the empty diner
his clothes frozen
your fathers in back wade
marg had to babysit him
she moved in with you huh
looking closer what happened
wade goes to the kitchen
glen whitehouse washing dishes with margie looks up ah the prodigal son
about fucking time
look got me a new job second cook and bottle washer
jesus christ pop lets go home
i got waylaid
the fuck you got waylaid
you follow your prick around like it was your nose
enters can it whitehouse
to wade get him out of here
it was funny at first but im tired
theres clothes in the back
wades old man talks as he dresses lets go home
what home is that
lets have a talk about that
youre fucking sly wade
your mothers dead so she cant make any excuses for you anymore
you gotta deal with me
no more sugar tit asshole
wade redressed enters pop for christs sake
you think you can take me now
come on try
margie and nick guide pere et fils to margs car
nick speaks to her marg get out of this
marg drives off
wade leans close to his father his breath on his i wish you would die
pop spits directly into wades face raises his arm
wade catches it twists it
margie shrieks stop it
just stop it
they do glaring as they approach the farmhouse
wade looks in the bedroom sees margie sleeping goes to the bathroom
he peers stands before the sink washes his hands slowly
drying his hands he looks into the mirror startled by the image of his own face
a phone conversation plays over no shit rolfe i glanced up and there he was only it was me
but it was like i had never seen myself before
it was a strangers face
hard to explain
you fly on automatic pilot like i was doing all night and you disappear
wade sits alone in the darkened room speaking on the phone
his cigarette glows
then you accidentally see your body or your face or whatever and you dont know who the hell it belongs to
its the business with the old man i know and how incredibly pissed i was at him and also chasing jack hewitt like that and the goddamned truck going through
the ice not to mention margies being so upset one thing on top of another
wade are you alright
but you gotta hear this
you wont believe it
mel gordon had come by to visit lariviere and so now im in his office
wades theory expanded jack and gordon argue in the office
an extension of scene
like wades other theories in black and white hes on to us
what are we gonna do
maybe i can buy him off
i gotta talk to mel
you cant buy wade off
we bought you
that was me
wade drives margies car toward larivieres
in his rear view window he spots chick ward driving chub merritts tow truck lights blinking pulling larivieres pickup like a dead fish
he pulls over lets it pass
hes parked in front of alma pittmans house
a sign on the lawn reads alma pittman town clerk
he looks at the house decides to go in
wade walks up the shoveled steps knocks on the door
alma wearing plaid shirt and slacks greets him with a smile wade
have a cup of coffee
they step into almas living room office
shes been keeping the town secrets for as long as anyone can remember
you got yourself a computer alma
been putting my files into it
you take sugar and milk
they sit by her desk at the bay window
she studies him
are you alright wade
i got this damned tooth i got a few things bugging me like everybody else
but im okay
well you look
i dont mean to pry
im sorry about your mother
it was a nice funeral
alma i think theres some dirty business going on in this town
always has been
this is maybe worse than you and i are used to
beat what im talking about im talking about murder
among other things
evan twombley the union boss who got shot
somebody murdered him
you know jack hewitt the kid i work with
gordon lariviere examines his damaged pickup outside the shell station
wade finishes if jack told the truth he could be free by the time hes my age
sometimes things are simpler than you think
let me ask you a question
you dont believe me
crosses to her desk about jack
have you checked out the tax bill on your fathers farm lately
i know hes due for the last two years
i was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in
has anybody offered to buy it
as a mater of fact yes
alma punches her computer
dozens of items flash up
this is all the real estate transactions in this town the last year
most of it unused land
most of it for little more than the back taxes owed
she punches again only three items
this is from three years ago
some difference huh
looking what is the northcountry development association
i went down to concord to check it out
the president is mel gordon
the vice president and treasurer is gordon lariviere
those boys are buying up the mountain wade
i believe thats out of larivieres league
he musta found out
they had to get rid of him
and jackll get blamed
all the figures show is that gordon lariviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as selectman
in a year or two you wont recognize this town
wade storms in shouting
jack and jimmy choose donuts by the file cabinet
larivieres behind his desk
wades tooth makes it hard for him to talk without pain you sneaky sonofabitch
ive got your number now gordon
all these years i actually thought you were a decent man
pounds fists on desk can you believe that
jack combative looks at wade
gordon stands before jack can speak wade youre done
extends hand let me have the shop keys
to jack and jimmy you two dont you get it
hes using you
youre his slaves
soft jesus christ jack dont you see that
the key wade
yeah you can have the key
its the key thats kept me locked to you all these years
i give it to you with pleasure
passes key now im free
see how easy it is jack
all you got to do is give back what the man gave you and youre free of him
turns to leave ive got to call my brother
wades phone conversation plays over as he goes to margies car
i know what it means
im just running out of ways to use it
phone conversation continues as wade drives to merritts shell station
to help jack of course and to nail those sonsofbitches the two gordons
thats what alma calls them
jesus rolfe whose side are you on
take care of the little things first the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things
call chub merritt get your car back call a dentist for gods sake and get your tooth pulled dont trust the locals get your facts straight and go straight to
the state police
let them work on this
chick ward chub merritts mechanic greets wade outside the station
we join their conversation the good news is we havent got to your car yet
the bad news just tell me when youll have it fixed
the bad news is theres a problem with gordons truck what somebody drove through the ice last night
figured youd know something about that wade
i know about that
lariviere says he aint gonna pay for the fixin of your car
a couple hundred for the clutch
i got some more bad news
wanna hear it
chub says youre fired
he cant fire me
lariviere already did that this morning
hes a selectman
he said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office
im supposed to pull the cb and police light out of your car
theyre town property
wade open phone book in hand walks back and forth speaking into the receiver
margie looks up from the kitchen table an old newspaper in front of her
what do you mean you cant take me today
i told you the other party has hung up
margie stands upset
wade slams the phone down
what on earth is happening to you
why are you acting this way
its my tooth
my fucking tooth
i cant even think anymore because of it
i heard you talking
you got fired this morning didnt you
look thats temporary believe me
theres so much shit gonna hit the fan the next few days my getting fired by lariviere and merritt wont matter a bit
pop enters from outside with firewood passes
ill get another job
people are going to need me
after this is over theyll make me into a goddamned hero
you wait youll see ill deliver
ill be the best father who ever lived
you need me even pop for christs sake he needs me
this town needs me
maybe now they think they can send me howling into a corner like a kicked dog but my god itll be different soon
margies face falls
she retreats from the room as he speaks taking her coat and pocketbook
wade and his old man she thinks just the same
wade looks out the window and she gets in her car drives off
wade holds his inflamed jaw he can hardly see straight
pop turns on the tv in the living room boosts the volume
pop comes back in the room gets the canadian club pours himself a drink
leave the bottle out
pop growls goes back to wrestling on the tv
wade walks to the cabinet removes a pair of pliers from the tool drawer goes toward the bathroom
in the bathroom wade opens his mouth it hurts takes a bite of whisky sets the bottle on the toilet tank
he looks at the stranger in the mirror reaches inside his mouth with the pliers
prying his mouth open wade whitehouse locks the pliers onto a large molar in the back squeezes and pulls
he steadies himself pulls again yanking the pliers from his mouth
the bloody rotted tooth clatters in the sink
he takes another bite of whisky
rolfes voice plays over you will say i should have known terrible things were about to happen and perhaps i should have
but even so what could i have done by then
wade never went inside
he lived almost wholly out there on his skin with no interior space to retreat to even in a crisis
wade takes another swig sets the whisky bottle in the living room beside the tv set
wade and pop exchange looks
wade exits through the kitchen snatching his coat
wade spits blood into the snow as he grabs a gallon can of gasoline from under the porch
he crosses to the barn prepares to pour the gas into the beat up red truck
wades ford pickup passes j
battle hands office keeps going
grass peeks through the snow at this lower altitude
wade parks the truck walks past leafless bushes to a charcoal gray split level with pink shutters
he pushes the door bell the first notes of frere jacques play
lillian opens the door jills footsteps approach
shell be right out
looks back is there snow on the ground up in lawford
to jill see
get your boots
going back inside hi
have her back tomorrow night by six
you make me sick
i cant believe youve sunk so low
low as what
what have i done
its bad to want to see your own daughter
you know what im talking about
for what youre doing to me and to the child you say you love so much
you wont get away with it
jill returns wearing parka and boots heads out with her father
call me tonight if you want
wade and jill approach the truck
are we going in this
my cars in the shop
thisll be fine
its pretty old
it belongs to pop
wade opens the truck door
jill climbs in with her overnight bag looks back to the door where lillian watches
the ford heads north

wade looks over at jill and realizes she is crying

she shoves her clenched fists hard against her legs
please dont cry
regains composure what are you sorry for

i just thought you know wed sneak a big mac on mommy like we used to
i want to go home

jill looks away
wade pulls a six pack from under the seat pulls off a beer takes a swig
quiet thats illegal you know
youre a policeman
im nothing anymore
wade and jill enter wickhams crowded with out of state hunters at the end of the deer season
jillie you want a cheese grilled sandwich
its called a grilled cheese sandwich you dub
wade flaring reaches across the counter and grabs nick by the shirtfront
nicks arm knocks over a cup of coffee
the diner goes silent
hunters look up
jills face is white she starts to cry
wade looks over it takes him a moment to react bends down comforting her
he wipes her nose with a napkin
jill please its alright
i want to go home
rigid okay lets go home then
they head for the door
nick eases over delicate wade i got a message for you
wade turns jack hewitt hes looking for you
wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in town hall
you mean my old office
well i guess thats what he said
he got his deer yet
no hes out now
somewhere on the mountain
id stay away from him if i were you
hes real pissed
wade takes jills hand exits
jill waits in the old red truck parked outside
wade emerges with cardboard boxes of office miscellany rifles laid across top
he shoves the boxes and guns into the back of the pickup gets in and drives off
wade and jill pull up the drive past margies car into the barn
her trunk and two side doors are open
margie comes out back with a battered suitcase goes to her car
a plastic bag of clothes sits in the trunk
wade and jill get out approach going somewhere margie
im just cleaning out some of this stuff thats built up
for the rummage sale
and some things for the cleaners
and the laundromat
dont lie to me
youre leaving me i can see that
dont be silly
jill suitcase in hand looking pathetic tries to smile
a sadness passes over wades face
margie watching him quivers starts to cry
she drops her suitcase out of nowhere bawling like a baby
wade goes over puts his arms around her pats her back
his face is racked
he too seems about to cry if he could
in his arms margie feels trapped overwhelmed by wades circumstances and terrible sadness
she pushes crying leave me alone
leave me alone
she struggles in wades grasp
jill frightened wildly hits him from behind leave her alone
leave her alone
wade moves back like a bear covering his face and arms
jill near hysterical keeps after him arms and fists flying
wade stumbles backwards into the snow
jill still swings
margie dashes to intervene as wade swings his arms wide
jill flies into marg
her nose is bleeding
wades caught her across the mouth and nose
she takes cover behind margie crying
margie and jill stand side by side saying nothing
wade looks up stunned as if hit by a rock
marg slowly backs away her arms behind her holding jill
to jill get in
marg eases jill into the front seat closes the door edges around the car slamming the trunk and gets into the drivers seat
i want to go home
will you take me home
she closes the front door starts the car
she backs out the drive
in her rear view mirror she sees the image of wade receding standing frozen staring down at the snow
pop emerges from the house looks at his son grinning
wade looks at his old man that dumb devilish grin plastered on his fathers face
glen whitehouse holds an empty whiskey bottle like a pistol
hunters gunshots echo in the distance
satanic delight you
by christ you i know you
points bottle yeah you goddamn sonofabitch i know you
youre a goddamn fucking piece of my heart
dead you dont know me
you dont know me
beat so fuck you
nah nah naw
you done done finally done it
like a man done it
done it right
i love you you mean sonofabitch
pop holds up the bottle pretends to fire it at wade
what the fuck do you know about love
im made of love
call it what you want
everything you know is from me
you and me
wade waves his old man off trudges toward the barn
where the christ you going
you sonofabitch you leave my fucking truck where it is
give me the goddamn keys
i need to get me to town
nothing in the fucking house to drink
not a fucking thing
my house my money my truck stolen
i dont know you
my goddamn father and i dont know you
wade walks from the glistening snow into the dark barn
wade unloads the cardboard boxes filled with his office belongings from the back of the truck and sets them on the ground
he gathers up his rifles
a whiskey bottle slams against the back of his head
he drops to his knees the guns scatter
he looks up with childs fear and guilt at his father
glen whitehouse hovers over him huge and ferocious a colossus lifting the bottle like a jawbone
wade cringes scrambles for the dropped rifle
he grabs it by the barrel and twisting around swings it in a slow motion arc smashing the edge of the wood stock against his fathers head
a cold hard crack of bone
glen whitehouse shriveled again no longer mythic flies back like a stuffed dummy
he collapses beside the empty c
wade bleeding from the head stands staggers off pops inert body aims his rifle at the old mans face
i know you now
i love you too
wade bolts the rifle flicks off the safety fires a loud click
the guns empty
you scared me
he kneels down lovingly touches the old mans face caresses his lips cheeks nose brows smoothes back his stiff gray hair
pops eyes are clouded
blood suddenly drips from his ear to the ground
wade rests the rifle against the truck
he bends over slips his hands under his fathers body lifts him up
he carries pop over to the workbench lays him out
groping beneath the bench wade finds the kerosene lamp
he unscrews it pours kerosene the length of pops body
wade takes out his cigarette lighter ignites it holds it for a moment places it to glen whitehouse
fire spreads the length of pops body bursting like a shroud of yellow flame
the oil stained bench crackles flames shoot up the old weathered wall
burning flesh and heat drive wade backwards
wade stands in snow and sunlight
the entire barn is engulfed in flames
black smoke billows through the clear winter sky
inside glen whitehouse a pyre burns
the historical facts are known by everyone all of lawford all of new hampshire some of massachusetts
facts do not make history
our stories wades and mine describe the lives of boys and men for thousands of years boys who were beaten by their fathers whose capacity for love and trust was
crippled almost at birth and whose best hope if any for connection with other human beings lay in an elegiac detachment as if life were over
pops red truck is parked behind jack hewitts x on a snow banked road
wade hunting rifle pointed up traces jacks footsteps down the slope of the mountain
its how we keep from destroying in turn our own children and terrorizing the women who have the misfortune to love us how we absent ourselves from the tradition of
male violence how we decline the seduction of revenge
wade spots jack poised in a spruce grove watching for deer
wade bolts his rifle releases the safety aims and fires
jack hit in the chest falls bleeding between trees
blood stains the snow
jacks truck turned up three days later in a shopping mall in toronto
even without the footprints the bullet wades utter disappearance seemed evidence enough of his guilt
camera glides from room to room glimpsing details fragments of former times as if this were an historical site or memorial
the walls resonate lives were molded here
lariviere and mel gordon were indeed in business
the parker mountain ski resort is now advertised all across the country
jimmy dame tends bar at the lodge
chub merritt opened a snowmobile dealership nick wickham runs the new burger king
margie fogg moved to littleton nearer her mother lillian and jill went with bob horner to a new job in seattle
out a window workers gather charred timbers from the barn throw them on a truck
we want to believe wade died died that same november froze to death on a bench or a sidewalk
you cannot understand how a man a normal man a man like you and me could do such a terrible thing
unless the police happen to arrest a vagrant who turns out to be wade whitehouse or maybe he wont be a vagrant maybe he will have turned himself into one
of those faceless fellows working at the video store and lives in a town house apartment at the edge of town until his mailman recognizes him from the picture at the post office unless that happens there will be no more mention of him and his friend jack hewitt and our father
the story will be over
except that i continue
