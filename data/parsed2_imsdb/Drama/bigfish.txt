written by john august based on the novel by daniel wallace final production draft this is a southern story full of lies and fabrications but truer for their inclusion
were underwater watching a fat catfish swim along
this is the beast
there are some fish that cannot be caught
its not that theyre faster or stronger than other fish
theyre just touched by something extra
call it luck
call it grace
one such fish was the beast
the beasts journey takes it past a dangling fish hook baited with worms
past a tempting lure sparkling in the sun
past a swiping bear claw
the beast isnt worried
by the time i was born he was already a legend
hed taken more hundred dollar lures than any fish in alabama
some said that fish was the ghost of henry walls a thief whod drowned in that river years before
others claimed he was a lesser dinosaur left over from the cretaceous period
will bloom age listens wide eyed as his father edward bloom s and handsome tells the story
in every gesture edward is bigger than life describing each detail with absolute conviction
i didnt put any stock into such speculation or superstition
all i knew was id been trying to catch that fish since i was a boy no bigger than you
closer and on the day you were born that was the day i finally caught him
a few years later and will sits with the other indian guides as edward continues telling the story to the tribe
now id tried everything on it worms lures peanut butter peanut butter and cheese
but on that day i had a revelation if that fish was the ghost of a thief the usual bait wasnt going to work
i would have to use something he truly desired
edward points to his wedding band glinting in the firelight
confused your finger
edward slips his ring off
while the other boys are rapt with attention will looks bored
hes heard this story before
i tied my ring to the strongest line they made strong enough to hold up a bridge they said if just for a few minutes and i cast upriver
edward is chatting up wills pretty date to the homecoming dance
she is enjoying the story but also the force of edwards charisma
the beast jumped up and grabbed it before the ring even hit the water
and just as fast he snapped clean through that line
will now with braces is fuming and ready to leave
his mother sandra from whom he gets his good looks and practicality stands with him at the door
you can see my predicament
my wedding ring the symbol of fidelity to my wife soon to be the mother of my child was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish
low but insistent make him stop
his mother pats him sympathetically then adjusts his tie
what did you do
i followed that fish up river and down river for three days and three nights until i finally had him boxed in
will regards his father with exasperated contempt
with these two hands i reached in and snatched that fish out of the river
i looked him straight in the eye
and i made a remarkable discovery
will now sits with his gorgeous bride josephine
this is their wedding reception crowded with their friends and family
they should be joyful but will is furious
edward has the floor ostensibly for a toast
the room is cozy and drunk
this fish the beast
the whole time we were calling it a him when in fact it was a her
it was fat with eggs and was going to lay them any day
over near the doorway we spot sandra just returned from the restrooms
she looks gorgeous
she couldnt be any happier if this were her own wedding
now i was in a situation
i could gut that fish and get my ring back but doing so i would be killing the smartest catfish in the ashton river soon to be mother of a
will cant take any more
josephine tries to hold him back but he gets up and leaves
edward doesnt even notice
did i want to deprive my soon to be born son the chance to catch a fish like this of his own
this lady fish and i well we had the same destiny
as he leaves will mutters in perfect unison with his father we were part of the same equation
will reaches the door where his mother intercepts him
honey its still your night
will cant articulate his anger
he just leaves
now you may well ask since this lady fish wasnt the ghost of a thief why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it
closer he holds up his ring that was the lesson i learned that day the day my son was born
he focuses his words on sandra
this story is and has always been about her more than anyone
sometimes the only way to catch an uncatchable woman is to offer her a wedding ring
a laugh from the crowd
edward motions for sandra to get up here with him
as she crosses we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other
as they kiss edward tweaks her chin a special little way
the crowd applauds
edward toasts the happy couple
josephine covers well for her absent husband a smile as warm as summer
edward downs his champagne in a gulp
we come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk
occasional passersby take notice especially as it gets more heated
both men are a little drunk
what a fathers not allowed to talk about his son
disbelieving i am a footnote in that story
i am the context for your great adventure
which never happened
you were selling novelty products in wichita the day i was born
shaking his head jesus christ
friend of yours
did you help him out of a bind
come on will
everyone likes that story
no dad they dont
i do not like the story
not anymore not after a thousand times
i know all the punchlines dad
i can tell them as well as you can
closer for one night one night in your entire life the universe does not revolve around edward bloom
it revolves around me and my wife
how can you not understand that
a long beat then
low sorry to embarrass you
will wont let him get the last word
youre embarrassing yourself dad
you just dont see it
angle on edward
a hand to wave enough of you
he walks away
angle on will still fuming with righteous anger
its then we freeze frame
after that night i didnt speak to my father again for three years
a typically busy day
on hold with the phone cradled under an ear will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his desk
without pauses william bloom with the associated press if i could just
hes put back on hold
returning to the mail he finds a hand addressed envelope
rips it open
we communicated indirectly i guess
in her letters and christmas cards my mother would write for both of them
at the table sandra talks on the phone while edward fixes a sandwich
when id call mom would say that dad was out driving
or swimming in the pool
edward takes a seat starting to eat his sandwich
true to form we never talked about our not talking
sandra stands by the window watching as
edward swims laps in the family pool
hes born to the water
the truth is i didnt see anything of myself in my father and i dont think he saw anything of himself in me
we were like strangers who knew each other very well
edward stares intently into the water a lion in wait
in telling the story of my fathers life its impossible to separate the fact from the fiction the man from the myth
the best i can do is to tell it the way he told me
we look down at the river where edwards reflection is caught in the dark water
as the water ripples past something changes
sure enough as we look up again its a younger edward bloom s staring into the water
hes not just handsome not just charming
its as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him
it doesnt always make sense and most of it never happened
suddenly this edward thrusts both hands into the water grabbing hold of he brings the catfish up to his face
looks it right in the eye
a beat then the beast spits out edwards gold ring
but thats what kind of story this is
smiling edward takes the ring then throws the beast back into the water with a splash
bennett stands between the wifes legs
shes flustered and sweating but the doctor has a comforting bedside manner
bloom ill need you to give me one good push
suddenly we hear a pop as a slimy mass of human being rockets into the doctors unprepared hands
bennett tries to hold tight but the infant is slippery like a fish
it shoots up into air
the nurses and the husband try to grab the baby but no one can hold it
as the newborn sails upward towards camera we can see a giggling smile on its face
as it falls the newborn knocks over a tray which provides it a ramp to slide right out of the room
everyone races after it
bursting through the doors grab that baby
a nurse finally scoops up the slippery baby
everyone lets out a collective sigh of relief
my fathers birth would set the pace for his unlikely life
no longer than most mens but larger
and as strange as his stories got the endings were always the most surprising of all
over the sound of rain a phone rings on a chair
by the tone of the ring we know were not in the u
it has that insistent european sound
as it keeps ringing we look to see the apartment is mostly empty just a few half unpacked boxes
a cradle is still in its carton
keys in the lock
laughter in the hallway
the door swings open to reveal a drenched will carrying four sacks of groceries the bottoms collapsing from the rain
his wife josephine pushes past him to get the phone
will begins stripping out of his wet clothes each layer unleashing a new drizzle
he plays it up trying to get a reaction out of josephine
on phone yes hes here
she hands the phone to will concerned
its your mother
half stripped will takes the phone
this wont be good news
on phone hi
as josephine takes off her rain coat we see she is very very pregnant
she listens carefully to wills side of the conversation trying to gauge how bad the news is
what does dr
no sure let me talk to him
he covers the mouthpiece
looks over to josephine
its more than they thought
theyre going to stop chemo
you need to go
im going with you
you dont have to
a simple fact im going with you
as the plane continues boarding a stewardess recites the welcome spiel in french
will has a window seat in coach
josephine sits beside him putting on hand lotion
taking his hands she rubs the excess into him
theres an effortless intimacy between them
she can pinpoint what hes feeling before he can
hours later and the lights are dimmed
most of the passengers are asleep including josephine
her head is propped against wills shoulder her hands tucked under her belly
will watches her sleep brushing back her hair
a beat then he notices a bored boy in the next row over
off the glow of the reading light the boy is using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back
the kid is pretty good making a convincing bird a passable monkey and finally a dog
we push in on the silhouettes
so which ones it gonna be
the monkey in the barn the dog in the road
focusing on the final shadow we
come to find edward making the shapes
will sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him
the endtable lamp lies between them its shade off to cast big shadows on the wall
the one about the witch
your mom says i cant tell you that one anymore
you get nightmares
im not scared
edward looks around for a beat seeing if his wife is in earshot
he then leans in complicitous
neither was i
will smiles excited to hear the forbidden story
this all happened in the swamp outside of ashton
kids werent supposed to go out in the swamp on account of the snakes and spiders and quicksand that would swallow you up before you could even scream
but there were five of us out there that night me ruthie wilbur freely and the price brothers don and zacky
edward holds up his hand counting the names on his fingers
not a one of us knew what was in store
as his hand moves past the light we a flashlight sweeps past
the night is whirring and breathing alive
the moon hangs low casting long shadows
five kids walk past in silhouette
four have flashlights on
the fifth keeps tripping crashing into young edward
zacky turn your flashlight on
i dont got any batteries
red headed zacky price is
his brother don price is and a lot bigger than the others
then whyd you bring it
i dont want to be in the swamp with a witch and no flashlight
wilbur freely also is the black asthmatic son of a sharecropper
redheaded ruthie macklin is happy just to be there
is it true she got a glass eye
i heard she got it from gypsies
whats a gypsy
your mommas a gypsy
your mommas a bitch
you shouldnt swear
theres ladies present
whispering turn off your flashlights
shell see em
moving up behind the kids we find ourselves at the gates of
now its common knowledge that most towns of a certain size have a witch if only to eat misbehaving children and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard
witches use those bones to cast spells and curses that make the land infertile
we pull back and back revealing more of the gothically creepy house its broken windows strangling vines and eerie gargoyles half buried in the dirt
even bats are afraid to fly over it
in the moonlight the house is especially sinister
who knows what is lurking in the shadows
yet of the all the witches in alabama there was one who was the most feared
for she had one glass eye which was said to contain mystical powers
we finally come to the kids staring in through the gate
i hear if you look right at it you can see how youre gonna die
thats bull s h i t that is
shes not even a real witch
youre so sure why dont you go in and get that eye
i heard she keeps it in a box on her nighttable
edward looks back at the spooky house
or are you too scared
ill go in right now and get that eye
then do it
fine i will
fine you do it
fine im doing it
he hands zacky his flashlight then starts climbing the gate
shell make soap out of you
to ruthie thats what she does she makes soap out of people
edward drops down on the far side of the gate
truth be told edward is scared but he forges ahead anyway
wilbur looks to ruthie and theyre in complete agreement
they get the hell out of there
zacky would run too but don holds him by the collar
edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door
anything could jump out of them
he steps on the porch
the boards squeal and creak but he continues on
a cat screams out from a broken wicker rocker
catching his breath edward reaches the front door
the doorknob is ancient brass two projections that look like horns
yet edward extends his hand reaching closer and closer before he finally impossibly fast the door opens revealing an old woman with a patch over her left eye
she looks like shes been dead for years but too stubborn to lie down
calm and straightforward maam my name is edward bloom and theres some folksd like to see your eye
zacky and don price wait for edward each moment more convinced hes already dead
but suddenly hes back at the gate
you get the eye
i brought it
dubious lets see it
the old woman steps out of the shadows behind edward flipping up her eye patch
when their flashlight beam hits her left eye it shines with a hellish glow
we rush in on zacky who is paralyzed by what he sees
an old man zacky stands on a wobbly stepladder changing a lightbulb
suddenly the ladder gives way and he falls
we rush in on don price
twenty year old don price falls face forward on the tile face mushed in the grout
very much dead
don and zacky both tremble with fear
the latter has tears in his eyes
i saw how i was gonna die
i was old and i fell
i wasnt old at all
the brothers suddenly bolt
still standing next to the old woman edward smiles
edward helps her back inside
he could leave now but curiosity gets the better of him
i was thinking about death and all
about seeing how youre gonna die
the old woman turns to him slightly still not facing him
i mean on one hand if dying was all you thought about it could kind of screw you up
but it could kind of help you couldnt it
because youd know that everything else you can survive
the old woman smiles a little a crooked grin of broken teeth
i guess im saying id like to know
the old woman turns leaning her face right in front of his
and on a silent count of one two three edward looks into the eye
this time we dont cut
instead we hold on edward as he witnesses his death
he stares transfixed perplexed and amused
whatever he sees its not as dire as the other boys
his future has something strange in store
thats how i go
the old woman nods
still a little overwhelmed edward turns and leaves
from that moment on i no longer feared death
and for that i was as good as immortal
as edward leaves the door swings shut on its own
the front door opens to reveal will and josephine on the porch with their bags
reverse to wills mother sandra surprised and a little annoyed
how did you get here
the atlantic its not that big really
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport
we rented a car
simply you didnt need to do that
you just didnt
he leans in and hugs her
she surrenders squeezing her son tight
will and his mother are cut from the same cloth strong willed but practical
theyve always been close
im so glad youre here
that hug finished sandra pushes past her son to her daughter in law
seeing the size of her belly you shouldnt have flown
its good to see you
you look beautiful
its not flattery
its the truth
ill bet you need to yes
down the hall on the right
the door sticks
you have to really pull it
josephine squeezes past a smile to her husband be nice
will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage
sandra follows him
coming down the driveway we get to see the house for the first time an older suburban home three bedrooms big for the neighborhood and nicely grown into the lot
kids are playing on the street
is that dr
hes up with your father
heading back to the house
how is he
he wont eat
and because he wont eat he gets weaker
and because hes weaker he doesnt want to eat
how much time does he have left
you dont talk about those things
sandra is pouring iced tea for will and josephine
julius bennett enters from the foyer still winded from coming down the stairs
he was the towns first black physician
hes still the towns best physician
its good to see you
they shake my wife josephine
he judges her belly
youre seven months
impressed to the day
he leans close to her whispering in her ear
its a boy
she smiles surprised but not doubting
will looks over what did he say
josephine shakes her head
back to the main subject
you dont think he looks any worse
i would say hes the same
and in the silence that follows a lot is said
it wasnt the upbeat reply sandra was hoping for
can i see him
be good for you to talk to him
a moment of awkwardness everyone here knows they havent spoken in years
sandra hands will a squat can of ensure from the case on the counter
get him to drink one of these
he wont but tell him he has to
coming out from the kitchen will slowly climbs the stairs
they creak with every step
the wall is filled with family photos happier times
most of the pictures are of will starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding
as he climbs the stairs we can see him growing up with every step
a crack of sunlight spills around the half open door at the end of the hallway
will walks towards it running a hand along the wallpaper
almost at the door he stops for a beat
gets his breath
then goes inside
edward bloom lies asleep on the bed
although hes not the vibrant man weve seen before its not as bad we feared
the illness has been quick and left him largely intact
there are no i
s no monitors nothing
coming up to the bed dad
edward cracks open an eye a beat before he focuses
he tries to say something but no words come out
he looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand
will pours him a glass of water helping him hold it to his parched lips
finished edward sets down the glass by himself
a very long tense beat
will almost speaks again to fill the silence
you he points are in for a surprise
having a kid changes everything
i mean theres the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings
did you do any of that
no but i hear its terrible
then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine
you think im up for it
you learned from the best
will doesnt rise to the challenge
a beat then he remembers the can of ensure
holds it up
just drink half the can
ill tell her you drank the whole thing
a beat then edward rolls his eyes
will cracks open the can finding a straw on the nightstand
people neednt worry so much
its not my time yet
this isnt how i go
i saw it in the eye
the old lady by the swamp
she was a witch
no she was old and probably senile
i saw my death in that eye
and this is not how it happens
so how does it happen
wouldnt want to ruin it for you
edward slurps down as much of the ensure as he can stand then pushes the can away
he swallows with difficulty
there was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when i came out of this coffee shop near the office
and every day i gave him a quarter
then i got sick and was out for a couple of weeks
and when i went back there you know what he said
what did he say
you owe me three fifty
when did you ever work in an office
theres a lot you dont know about me
edward gives a wry smile
he walked into that
your mother was worried we wouldnt talk again
and look at us
were talking fine
were storytellers both of us
i speak mine out you write yours down
will wont commit to edwards assessment
dad im hoping we can talk about some things while im here
you mean while im here
id just like to know the true versions of things
edward laughs a little which becomes a cough
the hacking escalates until another drink of water gets it under control
its not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from talking
your mother hasnt been keeping up the pool
if you wanted to you could
you know where the chemicals are
i used to do it when you were gone remember
i used to do it a lot
he didnt mean for that to sound so pointed
taking the half empty ensure will gets up to go
hes at the door when
i was never much for being at home will
its too confining
and this here
being stuck in bed
dying is the worst thing that ever happened to me
he smiles at his joke
i thought you werent dying
i said this isnt how i go
the last part is much more unusual
trust me on that
shutting the door behind himself will drinks the rest of the ensure himself
edward was right
it tastes horrible
heading for the stairs will walks past an open door
as he leaves frame we stay behind to look inside
where an eight year old will is propped up in bed his face covered with chicken pox and pink calamine lotion
hes showing edward how many bumps there are on his arm
bennett says im going to have to be home for a week
i once had to stay in bed for three years
did you have chicken pox
wearing a white shirt and tie young edward still about sings down to the river my lord along with the congregation
his voice is high and thin but he gives it his all
suddenly his voice cracks and drops a half octave
and then another
his friends wilbur freeley and ruthie look over wondering whats wrong
embarrassed edward just keeps singing trying to follow along with the baritone part
he pulls at his collar
then pulls again his face getting red
starting to panic he loosens his tie
hes starting to undo the collar button when it pops off by itself
two more buttons fly off
one hits a chubby woman in the neck
as we watch edwards pant cuffs rise inch by inch thats how fast hes growing
truth is no one quite knew what was wrong
most times a person grows up gradually
i found myself in a hurry
young edward lies in bed his limbs connected to various pulleys and levers to support his weight
he has a dozen encyclopedias around him and another dozen on the floor
my muscles couldnt keep up with my bones and my bones couldnt keep up with my bodys ambition
so i spent the better part of three years confined to my bed with the world book encyclopedia being my only means of exploration
i had made it all the way to the gs hoping to find an answer to my gigantificationism when i uncovered an article about the common goldfish
insert the encyclopedia article complete with drawings
reading kept in a small bowl the goldfish will remain small
with more space the fish can grow double triple or quadruple its size
young edward thinks this through
it occurred to me then that perhaps the reason for my growth was that i was intended for larger things
after all a giant man cant have an ordinary sized life
the crack of a bat announces the game winning home run
the crowd cheers the swing and especially the batter as he rounds the bases
although weve seen him briefly before this is our first real exposure to grown up edward who well follow from roughly the ages of to
as soon as my bones had settled in their adult configuration i set upon my plan to make a bigger place for myself in ashton
single shots football hero edward leads his team to victory
on the sidelines a pretty girl admits the name of her secret love edward bloom
the other girls squeal in agreement
don price looks over glowers
single shot a lawnmower roars along the grass
we look up to see whos pushing it but its not edward
its one of his teenage employees
edward is back at the truck which is painted to read bloom landscaping
he has workers on every lawn
he signs an autograph for an admiring cub scout
edward takes an impossible shot at the buzzer from the other end of the court
naturally he makes it winning the game
as the crowd goes wild for edward don price is the only teammate who doesnt mob him
edward carries a dog out of a burning house
edward wins a blue ribbon for his invention a machine labelled perpetual motion
he and the judge pose for a photograph
pissed don price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the trash
a dashingly handsome edward leads the cast out for a curtain call
hes the star of the show
off to the side we see don price is the ass end of a horse costume
edward soaks in his applause smiling and gracious
edward accepts his diploma
the principal hugs him tight
i was the biggest thing ashton had ever seen
until one day a stranger arrived
as two farmers shake their heads we reverse to a show a massive hole punched through the side of a barn
its roughly the shape of man but no human could be that large
two fat ewes look up a shadow falling across them
they bleat in panic as reach in and scoop them up
their protests continue as theyre carried away one under each arm
we still havent seen the full stranger
a mob of about have gathered many of them with shotguns
amid the crowd we see don price
he ate an entire cornfield
he ate my dog
if you aint gonna stop him mayor we will
i wont have mob violence in this town
now has someone tried talking to him
you cant reason with im
hes a monster
agreement from the crowd
ill do it
everyone turns to see who said that
the crowd parts to reveal none other than edward bloom
don price glowers
ill talk to him
see if i can get him to move on
son that creature could crush you without trying
trust me hell have to try
edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside reaching the mouth of a cave
outside buzzards squabble over the remains of the giants feast broken barrels bones picked clean
in his most serious voice edward calls out hello
theres no answer
my name is edward bloom
i want to talk to you
from deep in a cave a thunderous voice the giants voice has such force it blows edwards hair back
im not going anywhere until you show yourself
a beat then we hear a rumble like a train coming
edward braces himself fists ready for a fight if thats what its going to take
as the rumble gets louder the ground starts to shake
even edward starts to worry
just how big is this guy
armed with the foreknowledge of my own death i knew the giant couldnt kill me
all the same i preferred to keep my bones unbroken
edward picks up a stone ready to play david to goliath
then suddenly the giant bursts forth
hunched over he slams into a stunned edward knocking him halfway down the hill
karl the giant is bigger than any man youve ever seen
not just tall but massive
hes completely feral with a beard to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered
what remains of his clothes are ragged and muddy
god knows whats living in his matted hair
karl leans over edward blocking the sun
edward throws his rock but it just bounces off
the giant didnt even notice it
why are you here
edward ponders the best response settling on
so you can eat me
the town decided to send a human sacrifice and i volunteered
karls eyes narrow confused
edward stands up
my arms are a little stringy but theres some good eating on my legs
i mean id be tempted to eat them myself
beat so i guess just if you could get it over with quick
because im not much for pain really
edward closes his eyes hands at his side ready to be eaten
karl just stares at him not sure what to do
after a beat edward opens his eyes a tiny bit just to see what the giant is doing
relieved to see hes not licking his chops look i cant go back
im a human sacrifice
if i go back everyone will think im a coward
and id rather be dinner than a coward
karl sits down with a boom dejected
here start with my hand
itll be an appetizer
reaching up edward shoves his hand into karls mouth
but the giant spits it back out
i dont want to eat you
i dont want to eat anybody
its just i get so hungry
im too big
and thats the sad truth
karl is less a monster than a freak a giant man but in the end just a man
edward takes a seat beside him
did you ever think maybe youre not too big
maybe this towns just too small
i mean look at it
circling behind them we look down at ashton a tiny town in a tiny valley
hardly two stories in the whole place
now ive heard in real cities theyve got buildings so tall you cant even see the tops of em
wouldnt lie to you
and theyve got all you can eat buffets
you can eat a lot cant you
so why are you wasting your time in a small town
youre a big man
you should be in the big city
karl smiles but then it fades
a certain sad suspicion youre just trying to get me to leave arent you
thats why they sent you here
whats your name giant
and truthfully i do want you to leave karl
but i want to leave with you
closer you think this town is too small for you well its too small for a man of my ambition
i cant see staying here a day longer
you dont like it
i love every square inch of it
but i can feel the edges closing in on me
a mans life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this
beat so what do you say
karl thinks a moment
they shake on it
now first we gotta get you ready for the city
in a single shot karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers while edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt
spirits buoyed by the high school marching band all the good citizens of ashton are gathered to see off edward and karl
theres a few tears amid the familiar faces
loudly for the crowd edward bloom first son of ashton its with a heavy heart we see you go
but take with you this key to the city and know that any time you want to come back all our doors are open to you
edward ducks a bit so the mayor can put the key around his neck
the crowd cheers
and with that edward and karl start walking waving as they go
only don price smoking on the corner isnt sad to see edward go
he crushes his cigarette under his heel
he wishes he could crush edward
many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug edward or shake his hand
that afternoon as i left ashton everyone seemed to have advice
find yourself a nice girl
dont trust anyone in kentucky
watch your pride edward bloom
but there was one person whose counsel i held above all others
as the crowd parts he finds himself face to face with the ruckus slows and quiets as if a strange spell has been cast
she motions for edward to lean down so she can whisper something to him
although were very close we cant hear her voice
she said that the biggest fish in the river gets that way by never being caught
the advice only succeeds in confusing edward
to the old woman okay
edward and karl keep walking
the old woman shuffles off somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded
what did she say
we tilt up from the road to reveal edward and karl walking out of ashton
each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions
there were two roads out of ashton a new one which was paved and an older one that wasnt
people didnt use the old road anymore and it had developed the reputation of being haunted
edward and karl come to a bend where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight
the old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger
since i had no intention of ever returning to ashton this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old road
karl looks at the dirt road wary
you know anyones whos taken it
that poet norther winslow did
he was going to paris france
he must have liked it because no one ever heard from him again
beat tell you what
you take the other way and ill cut through here
meet you on the far side
a little paranoid
youre not trying to run away
just to be sure you can take my pack
karl perks up even though it means more for him to carry
the road is overgrown but not altogether creepy
the sun is still shining and the birds still chirping
spinning the key to the city edward whistles because its a day meant for whistling
the road has narrowed to a rough path
spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy catching particles in the air
still edward whistles
coming around a bend his pitch drops as he sees thick thorny vines growing across the path
for the first time he realizes the birds have stopped singing
the forest is dead quiet
he looks back the way he came
its tempting to go back
it would be easier to go back
but edward presses on
he carefully steps through the thorns
his trouser legs catch on the barbs
we can hear the fabric tear
a scratched and sweaty edward waves off various stinging bugs flying at him finally whipping off his hat to swat at them
just then a cawing crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands
you stupid sonofa
he stops his swearing but grabs a rock and throws it
the stone ricochets off a tree and into a bees nest
the swarm roars out
edward high tails it each step still precarious
edward is bruised battered and bee stung
a half broken sign lies in the road
edward picks it up
reads it sure enough up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with thick cobwebs heavy from the rain
there comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit hes made a terrible mistake
the truth is i was never a reasonable man
edward tosses the sign and forges ahead into the spiderwebs
and what i recalled of sunday school was that the more difficult something became the more rewarding it was in the end
edward emerges from the forest brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt
one is stuck in his sleeve and he has to dance to get it out
even then he still keeps twitching convinced another one is left behind
at his feet the gravel road has returned smooth and dusty and comforting
ahead lies a tiny one street town smaller even than ashton with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it
dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes their laces tied together
he passes a sign that reads welcome to spectre
its a main street with stores on each side coles pharmacy talbots five and dime als country store
everything is old but this isnt a ghost town
in fact theres a group of about citizens spilling out to see edward approach
most are smiling
there are even a few tears of joy
whats more all of these people are barefoot
a forty year old man named beamen comes out of the seed store to greet edward
friendly but a little drunk hes the closest thing the town has to a mayor
hes carrying a clipboard
welcome to ya
whats your name
beamen checks the clipboard
not finding the name he flips forward a few pages
bloom like a flower
we werent expecting you yet
you were expecting me
a helpful woman named mildred chimes in you must have taken a shortcut
it nearly killed me
lifell do that to you
and truthfully the long way is easier but its longer
and youre here now and thats what matters
beamens daughter jenny hides behind her father peering around to look at the handsome stranger
what is this place
the town of spectre
best kept secret in alabama
says here youre from ashton right
last person we had from ashton was norther winslow
what ever happened to him
hes still here
let me buy you a drink
ill tell you all about it
hell ill have him tell you
ive gotta meet somebody
im already running late
he didnt mean it as a joke but for some reason everyones laughing
son i already told you
sitting at the kitchen table edward takes a second slice of apple pie
he and beamen are joined by norther winslow who fancies himself a cultured artist though hes never left the state
now tell me if that isnt the best pie you ever ate
it truly is
young jenny is stealthily untying the laces on edwards shoes
everything here tastes better
even the water is sweet
never gets too hot too cold too humid
at night the wind goes through the trees and youd swear there was a whole symphony out there playing just for you
suddenly jenny yanks off edwards shoes
she races for the door
he chases after her
as she runs jenny ties edwards laces together
reaching the edge of town she tosses the shoes up and around the power line a perfect throw
theres no way hes ever getting them down
the gathered citizens of spectre cheer for edward who is confused and overwhelmed
the women hug him
men shake his hand
still focused on his shoes
i need those
there is no softer ground than town
he is our poet laureate
the townsfolk continue to congratulate edward
sometimes in a dream youll visit places that seem instantly familiar filled with friends youve never met
edward sits with norther winslow
the fireflies are out
thousands of them
a man might travel his entire life and never find a place so inviting
my journey had scarcely begun and i had arrived
norther hands him his noteboook
ive been working on this poem for years
theres a lot of expectation
i dont want to disappoint my fans
its only three lines long
norther grabs his notebook back
this is why you dont show work in progress
norther do you ever regret not making it to paris
i cant imagine any place better than here
youre a poet
you oughta be able to
and maybe if youd seen more you could
norther doesnt answer
just goes back to his notebook
by the light of the full moon edward soaks his feet in the water trying to make sense of it all
the key to the city dangles around his neck
he stares at himself in the reflection
its then that a woman emerges at the far side of the river
no telling where she came from she must have been swimming underwater
we never see her face
she stands in the river with her bare back to edward squeezing the water out of her golden hair oblivious to his presence
edward is breathless
its the first woman hes seen in her natural state and he doesnt dare move lest he frighten her away
then he sees the snake
its a cottonmouth has to be
it leaves a break in the water its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh
theres no decision to be made
on pure instinct edward dives in
he swims as hard as can just as its about to strike
the woman dives back underwater understandably terrified that a man is coming at her
no its okay
i got it
i got the snake
as the splashing subsides edward looks at what he holds in his hands
which isnt a snake at all but rather a common stick
and a non threatening one at that
while edward ponders his mistake he looks around to discover that the girl in the river is gone
he never even saw her face
edward keeps expecting her to surface somewhere but she never does
he stands alone in the river wondering what tricks his eyes are playing on him
theres leeches in there
edward looks to the bank where young jenny hill is watching him
did you see that woman
what did she look like
was she nekkid
embarrassed to admit it
matter of fact its not a woman its a fish
no one ever catches her
given the day hes had so far edward isnt inclined to follow up on the issue
he starts to wade back to the bank
fish looks diffrent to diffrent people
my daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was kid back from the dead
edward climbs up onto the shore completely drenched
he pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging to his skin
he starts to work pulling them off
edward and jenny walk back
how old are you
that means when im eighteen youll be
and when im youll only be
a little wary youre pretty good at arithmetic
and when im youll be
and thats not much difference at all
eager to get off this subject
sure is a lot now though huh
as edward and jenny approach main street they find downtown has been transformed
lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street and a small stage has been built at one end to hold fiddlers
the whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen edward bloom
before he can protest two women have grabbed him by the arms pulling him in to dance with them
the resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos
from farmer to bakers wife everyone wants to dance with edward who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool
still hes having a blast
jenny grabs both his hands and they spin wildly
beamen plucks his laughing daughter away to dance with her
then mildred cuts in to dance with edward
its hard to hear over the music
jenny thinks youre quite a catch
we all do
not hearing what
i said youre quite a catch
edward stops dancing
a beat then he heads for the edge of the crowd
beamen is there with jenny on his shoulders
i have to leave
this town is everything a man could ask for
and if i were to end up here id consider myself lucky
but the fact is im not ready to end up anywhere
no ones ever left
how are you gonna make it without your shoes
i suspect it will hurt a lot
and with that edward walks down main street
the townspeople stop dancing disbelieving some shaking their heads
poor edward blooms gone crazy
calling after him you wont find a better place
i dont expect to
jenny runs to him
shed tackle him if she could
promise me youll come back
when im really supposed to
its not good enough but it will have to do
edward keeps walking
various shots edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet
and then it gets worse
the trees ahead are moving
at first it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches but as we hear the wood cracking and groaning theres no mistaking it theyre trying to block him
snake like white roots shoot out of the ground grabbing for his ankles
he leaps up kicking off one tree trunk to grab another ones branches
he swings off lands and rolls
now all the trees are moving to block him their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of lightning
as difficult as it was to reach spectre i was fated to get there eventually
after all no man can avoid reaching the end of his life
as he ducks under branches the chain holding the key to the city gets caught
hes almost strangled but the chain finally breaks
the silver key disappears into the mud
scrambling forward he looks for a way out
but the trees have encircled him their spiky crowns bending down to crush him
he screams up at the night until his breath is gone
and then i realized this wasnt the end of my life
with a sudden calm
aloud this isnt how i die
another lightning flash and suddenly the trees are back where theyve always been
edward is lying shoeless and torn in a muddy puddle staring up at the rain
his bare foot steps onto asphalt
edward turns to see to his right coming down the larger paved road
what happened to your shoes
edward looks down at his muddy bloody feet
they got ahead of me
with that the men start walking down the larger road
edward and will sit at opposite ends of the table with sandra and josephine in the middle
although edward has a small plate of food in front of him he hasnt touched it
hes exhausted from the trip downstairs but determined to maintain the family dinner ritual
the other three eat awkwardly each clink and scrape of a knife or fork resonating
will finally breaks the silence
i dont know if youve seen it but josephine has some photos in the most recent newsweek
i spent a week in morocco for the story
it was incredible
well have to pick up a copy
as will scoops out another serving of potatoes edward suddenly speaks i dont know if youre aware of this josephine but african parrots in their native home of the congo
they speak only french
all three stop to listen
youre lucky to get four words out of them in english
but if you were to walk through the jungle youd hear them speaking the most elaborate french
those parrots talk about everything politics movies fashion everything but religion
taking the bait
why not religion dad
its rude to talk about religion
you never know who youre going to offend
josephine actually went to the congo last year
oh so you know
will shakes a shopping cart free from the pile up while his mother checks her list
sandra starts to bag string beans
mom would you say you understand dad
what i mean is do you really know whats going on in his head
how is that possible
i mean you try to ask him a question and suddenly its another one of his stories
decidedly you cant honestly say you know him
yes will i do
and dont presume things you dont know
shes more amused than annoyed but will is entering dangerous territory
would you say you understand josephine
but thats a different
no its not
its exactly the same
your father and i met we dated and we married we chose each other because we understood each other on some fundamental level
just the same as you two
she moves on to the carrots
josephine and i have a lot in common
yes you both think william bloom is a very smart man
beat the problem is you only see me as your mother and not as someones wife
and ive been his wife longer than ive been your mother
you cant discount that
but ive known him my whole life and i dont feel like i know him at all
or ever will
with a look sandra acknowledges the stakes
i know its not easy
just remember he didnt choose to be your father and you didnt choose to be his son
you just ended up together
you could pick numbers out of a dark bag and itd be just the same
if you ask me its a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all
but i understand you mom
i always have
well clearly you dont
but im not the mystery youre trying to solve right now
reaching the cashier sandra hands over her coupons
will is approaching with a newsweek magazine
two checkstands over an attractive blonde woman in her s is getting her change
though shes sandras generation she carries herself like a much younger woman with blue jeans and sneakers
she accidentally makes eye contact with will as he passes
we hold on the woman who tracks will as he reaches sandra
its hard to read her reaction does she recognize him or just find him attractive
will notices the gaze
the woman turns away
will racks his brain does he know this woman
before i forget your father has papers in the basement id like you to go through
i wouldnt know whats important
distracted mom do you know who that is
after a beat the blonde woman turns again semi casually
noticing that both will and sandra are looking she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave
no idea was she one of your teachers
but its weird
she seemed to recognize me
to the cashier do you know who that is
the cashier turns to look
he can only get a profile as the woman leaves
never seen her before
a portable fan quietly whirrs in the corner
turned low the radio on the nightstand is playing a call in am sports show just a wash of background chatter
edward lies asleep on his back
at the window josephine quietly lowers the shade
she reaches over edward to switch off the radio
he stirs from the silence he wasnt fully asleep and sees josephine stretched over him
playfully lecherous hello
how are you feeling
i was dreaming
what were you dreaming about
he tries to recollect but its already gone
josephine motions is it okay for her to sit on the bed
i dont usually remember unless theyre especially portentous
you know what that word means portentous
she shakes her head
means when you dream about something thats going to happen
beat gathering like one night i had a dream where this crow came and told me your aunt is going to die
i was so scared i woke up my parents
they told me it was just a dream to go back to bed
but the next morning my aunt stacy was dead
terrible for her but think about me young boy with that kind of power
wasnt three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said your grampa is going to die
well i ran right back to my parents
my father said no gramps is fine but i could see there was trepidation
and true enough that next morning my grampa was dead
he sits up a bit in bed his strength returning
for the next couple weeks i didnt have another dream
until one night the crow came back and said your daddy is going to die
beat well i didnt know what to do
but finally i told my father
and he said not to worry but i could tell he was rattled
that next day he wasnt himself always looking around waiting for something to drop on his head
because the crow didnt tell how it was going to happen just those words your daddy is going to die
well he went into town early and was gone for a long time
and when he finally came back he looked terrible like he was waiting for the axe to fall all day
he said to my mother good god
i just had the worst day of my life
beat you think youve had a bad day she said
this morning the milkman dropped dead on the porch
josephine smiles a half laugh which gets him smiling too
a long beat
because see my mother was banging the milkman
no i understand
he was slipping her a little extra cream
she nods a bit more of a laugh
he was filling her basket
he was making deliveries around back
as edward continues she cant help but laugh harder especially as the metaphors get more vulgar
he was buttering her rolls
pumping her churn
splashing milk in her box
they were squeezing the cheese
clanking the bottles
licking the popsicle
shes starting to cry from laughing
cracking the eggs and making an omelet
with that he stops
she regains her composure
spooning the sherbet
interrupting can i take your picture
you dont need a picture
just look up handsome in the dictionary
he rolls his eyes why not
josephine leaves heading down the hall to get her camera
we stay with edward in bed
i have photos from the wedding to show you
theres a great one of you and my father
i had an extra print made
edward grimaces a flash of pain
around others hes hiding how much it hurts but alone we can see how bad it is
he controls his breathing trying to push through it
i want to see pictures of your wedding
ive never seen any
she returns with her camera
edward smiles doing a good job masking the pain
thats because we didnt have a wedding
your mother in law was never supposed to marry me
she was engaged to somebody else
loading film i never knew
will never told you that
she shakes her head probably just as well
he would have told it all wrong anyway
all the facts and none of the flavor
oh so this is a tall tale
well its not a short one
a devilish smile
pushing past edward we settle on the whirling fan
held by a little boy
hes slumped over his fathers shoulder being carried towards a big top tent
where the second rate carnival is parked for the moment in an alabama field
to the left we spot edward ish halfway through a bag of peanuts
hes still carrying the backpack we saw earlier and scratched up from his trip through spectre
i had just left ashton and was on my way to discover my destiny
not knowing what that would be exactly i explored every opportunity that presented itself
joining the crowd he heads into the big top
a troupe of stilt walking firebreathers finishes their act to tremendous applause
as the performers clear away the circus owner and ringmaster amos calloway approaches the stands
he may only be four feet tall but amos has a titanic presence
ladies and gentlemen you may think youve seen the unusual
you may think youve seen the bizarre
but ive travelled to the five corners of the world and let me tell you ive never seen anything like this
from behind amos carnies start rolling a massive ball towards the crowd
when i found this man he was picking oranges in florida
his fellow workers called him el penumbra the shadow because when you were working beside him he blocked out the daylight
he could take a whole tree in his hands and shake off the fruit
i had to pay his crew boss just so i could take him with me
amos comes up to a middle aged woman in the first row a quieter moment
not to alarm you maam
but if this man wanted to he could crush your head between his toes
she trembles but he wont
a long beat hes not going to hurt her folks because hes our own gentle giant
ladies and gentlemen i give you colossus
the carnies back away from the ball as a deep drum roll begins
a moment then the ball starts to bulge from inside
a foot suddenly bursts out from within
gasps from the crowd
that foot is massive
in the stands edward looks closer
as the drum beat intensifies a second foot breaks out
followed by hands
finally the head
this is from a very low angle we look up to see just how massive he is
he seems to fill the heavens
with his shaved head and giant club he seems more ogre than man
in the bandstands a young boys jaw drops in awe
colossus walks down the row letting the crowd get a better look at him
some reach out to touch him disbelieving
a tight spotlight follows him revealing faces in the crowd
colossus passes edward who seems unimpressed
he leans with the spotlight whistling to get the big mans attention
he points to the edge of the stands where his friend is sitting on the dirt stands up so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold him
hes a good foot taller than colossus
theres a gasp from the crowd along with nervous anticipation what will happen next
angle on amos stunned megaphone dangling
angle on colossus realizing the gig is up
with a resigned shrug he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into the shadows
as the stands empty edward and karl talk to amos
whats his name
does he talk
its not important
tell me karl have you ever heard of the term involuntary servitude
karl shakes his head
it was on that night karl met his destiny
and i met mine
as amos pulls karl aside to give him the hard sell edward notices a beautiful young woman leaving with her family
shes wearing a blue dress and hat
for no good reason she looks back at edward
the two make eye contact
and as they do all motion freezes
a fiery baton remains mid twirl flames locked in place
a spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid air each kernel like a snowflake
even the elephant is mid poop
only edward is free to move winding his way between the frozen bodies ducking underneath arms to get closer and closer to this woman
they say when you meet the love of your life time stops
and thats true
what they dont tell you is that once time starts again it moves extra fast to catch up
suddenly everything rushes
the crowd becomes a blur and the young woman is lost in its wake
now its edward whos frozen helpless in time
edward checks in windows as cars pull out searching for his fated love
not finding her he becomes more frantic running down the rows
colossus is thumbing for a ride
the last pickup truck stops and lets him climb in back
as the truck pulls out it passes a dejected edward
hell never find that girl the love of his life
amos leans over so karl can sign a contract on his back
he spots edward walking back into the tent
your friend just made himself a star
amos hands off the contract to a clown
my attorney mr
good to meet you
soggybottom honks his horn then waddles off
whats the matter with you kid
i havent seen a customer so depressed since the elephant sat on that farmers wife
beat get it
the big guy likes it
i just saw the woman im going to marry i know it
but then i lost her
most men have to get married before they lose their wives
with absolute conviction im going to spend the rest of my life looking for her
that or die alone
realizing let me guess
real pretty blonde hair blue hat
i know her uncle
friends of the family
who is she
where does she live
dont waste your time
shes out of your league
as amos starts to walk away edward hurries to catch up with him
karl follows as well
what do you mean
you dont even know me
sure i do
you were hot shit back in hickville but here in the real world you got squat
you dont have a plan
you dont have a job
you dont have anything but the clothes on your back
ive got a whole backpack full of clothes
he points to the bleachers where no backpack is to be found
realizing someone stole my backpack
kid you were a big fish in a small pond
this here is the ocean and youre drowning
take my advice and go back to puddleville
youll be happy there
getting in front of amos edward stops him
you said i dont have a plan
im going to find that girl and marry her and spend the rest of my life with her
amos smiles amused
i dont have a job but i would have a job if you gave me one
and i may not have much but i have more determination than any man youre ever going to meet
i dont do charity
ill work night and day and you wont have to pay me
you just have to tell me who she is
amos takes a long look at him
ultimately theres no way he can say no
what the hell
every month you work for me ill tell you one thing about her
thats my final offer
edward shakes amoss hand before he can retract the offer
we move into a montage close on edward smiling nervously
his head is tilted to the side and as we pull back we see why hes holding it in a massive lions open mouth
the beasts sharp teeth are just poking his skin
if the lion so much as flinches edward is dead
the crowd applauds which makes the lion antsy
which makes edward antsier
from that moment on i did everything mr
calloway asked and a lot of things he didnt
id go three days without stopping to eat and four days without sleeping
his eyes droopy from lack of sleep edward mans the whirling amusement park ride
the only thing that kept me going was the promise of meeting the girl who would be my wife
nodding off edward falls backward into the path of the spinning arms
one of the hydra cars hits him square in the gut throwing him up and away sailing feet through the air
edward chases a costumed pig tripping over tent cords falling in the mud
his hunt leads him through the back of a tent where hes unwittingly stepped in front of a line of motorized birds
to the left customers are shooting with rifles
he dodges four shots that knock down the birds around him
he catches his breath lucky
then a half blind old woman pulls her trigger hitting him in the shoulder
karl the giant bandages edwards arm as well as he can
amos is walking past
its been a month today
amos stops looks at the young man
this girl the love of your life
her favorite flower is daffodils
he walks away
we push in on edward enraptured by the concept
to karl daffodils
edward shovels shit in the nastiest stables youve ever seen
but all he can think about is
to himself daffodils
the wonder of it
he goes back to shoveling a smile on his face
true to his word every month amos would tell me something new about the woman of my dreams
close on edward lost in quiet reverie pondering his latest bit of information
shes going to college
a sudden explosion as edward is shot
out of a giant cannon
under a full moon edward feeds the animals
to himself music
she likes music
i like music too
over the months i learned a lot about the woman i was going to marry but not her name and not where to find her
that time had come
i couldnt wait any longer
under a full moon edward walks up to the battered camper and is about to knock when he notices its rocking
not just that theres moaning coming from inside
but edward knocks anyway
its edward bloom
i need to talk to you
suddenly the rocking and moaning stop
a beat then the door handle begins to rattle
it seems to be stuck
edward turns the knob
suddenly the door bursts open
edward is knocked down by a massive black dog biggest youve ever seen
it has green glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue
edward wrestles with the beast its mouth snapping at his throat
blocking with an arm edward tries to push himself free but the creatures hands it has hands instead of paws hold on tight
entwined they roll across the dirt
the other nearby carnies scatter for cover
soggybottom pulls a revolver out of his clown suit
loads a silver bullet
edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off
he rolls to his feet
the hell hound squares back on its haunches growling ready for another leap
soggybottom sheds a clown tear aiming the revolver at the dog
at the last moment
edward moves just as mr
the bullet catches edward in the shoulder knocking him down
the carnies gasp
licking its chops the dog approaches the helpless edward who feels the ground around him looking for some kind of weapon
he finds only a small stick
he waves it at the dog ready to strike it
like magic the dogs whole demeanor changes
it bounces excitedly ready to play fetch
seeing an opportunity edward throws the stick as far as he can
the dog bounds after it it returns a beat later with the flaming stick which it drops at edwards feet
its tail whips back and forth
it was that night i discovered that most things you consider evil or wicked are simply lonely and lacking in the social niceties
edward throws the stick again
the dog takes off in a new direction
exhausted from playing fetch all night edward throws the stick into the woods
the still spry dog goes after it
its gone for a long time long enough that edward becomes concerned
he follows it into the woods
amos calloway stands up behind a bush buck naked and hairy
he still has the stick in his mouth which he takes out as edward approaches
didnt kill anything did i
a few rabbits but i think one of them was already dead
that would explain the indigestion
edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates
i was wrong about you kid
you may not have much but what you got you got a lot of
you could get any girl
theres only one i want
her name is sandra templeton
shes going to auburn
the semesters almost over so you better hurry
good luck kid
edward walks away
then starts running
he has to get there as soon as possible
amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot
edward shakes karls giant hand
after saying my goodbyes i hopped three trains to get to auburn that afternoon
we descend on the main quad to find edward bloom dunking his head in the fountain
he changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one just out of the package
its the mid s but by the conservative dress of the passing students it could be any era
edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half open door
through the crack we can see the edge of a young woman talking in hushed tones with another girl we cant see
finally a decision is reached
the door opens to reveal the woman of edwards dreams sandra kay templeton
shes effortlessly beautiful pure and simple as sunlight
he cant believe hes finally reached her
he half laughs nervous
that makes her laugh not sure whats going on
you dont know me but my name is edward bloom and i am in love with you
ive spent the last three years working to find out who you are
ive been shot and stabbed and trampled a few times had my ribs broken twice but its all worth it to see you here now and to finally get to
talk to you
because i am destined to marry you
i knew that from the first moment i saw you at the circus
and i know it now more than ever
on sandra overwhelmed
all she can finally think of to say is
dont need to apologize to me
i mean im the luckiest person youre going to find today
she puts her hand on the door frame
on her left ring finger we see a diamond
no im sorry i
im engaged to be married
on edward as his heart falls floors
he tries to suppress the reaction put on a brave front
but youre wrong
i do know you at least by reputation
edward bloom from ashton
see im actually engaged to a boy from ashton
he was a few years older than you
young don price shines his flashlight on edward
recapping earlier football baseball and basketball highlights we find edward beats don every time
a smoking don price crushes his cigarette as edward leaves town
edward is dumbstruck
with all the strength he can muster
im sorry to have bothered you
he turns and walks down the front steps
she stays in the doorway for a few beats feeling genuinely horrible for whats happened
but eventually she goes back inside
we hear giggles from inside as her sorority sisters get to the bottom of this
its not funny
that poor boy
we lead edward as he walks away tears just starting to form
fate has a cruel way of circling around on you
after all this work to leave ashton the girl i loved was now engaged to one of its biggest jerks
he exits frame leaving only the sorority house in the background
theres a time when a man needs to fight and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny is lost that the ship has sailed and that only
a fool would continue
edward steps back into frame looking at the sorority house
the truth is ive always been a fool
we circle as he shouts sandra templeton
i love you
and i am going to marry you
sandra and her sisters peer out through the curtains
is this guy crazy
the tweedy economics professor continues his explanation
sandra isnt paying a lot of attention
he switches on the overhead projector without looking at it
theres a titter from the students but he doesnt notice
a classmate nudges sandra who looks up
written on the projector is i love sandra templeton
shes horrified and excited at the same time
the professor finally notices whats written there
walking with her books sandra shakes her head disbelieving
we look up to the blue sky where a giant sky written heart floats in the wind
at her sisters prompting a just woken sandra looks out the second story window to find the lawn filled with edward stands amid the sea of flowers
hes waited there six hours
sandra walks out to him
shes smiling confused joyful and scared
all down greek street students are coming out to see the display
theyre your favorite flower
how did you get so many
i called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way i could get my wife to marry me
out of nowhere a tear drops down sandras cheek
she wipes it off
you dont even know me
i have the rest of my life to find out
from down the street
promise me you wont hurt him
if thats what you want i swear to it
the adult don price arrives
hes pounds of football playing skynyrd loving fraternity proud muscle
and hes pissed
a gang of his brothers walk behind him
what the hell are you doing
this is my girl
i didnt know she belonged to anybody
don price decks him knocking him down
edward gets right back up but makes no move to defend himself
unfazed don slugs him again
ignoring what the matter bloom
too scared to fight back
i promised i wouldnt
don shrugs fine
then proceeds to kick edwards ass nine ways to sunday
while i took the beating of a lifetime it was don price who was ultimately defeated
as the ass whupping continues we sitting on the can don price pinches a loaf while reading the new playboy
all the physical activity had worsened a congenital valve defect
put simply his heart wasnt strong enough
don price squeezes down hard trying to shit the unshittable
suddenly he grasps his chest and collapses face first on the tile
the same image of dons dead face on the tile is reflected in the eye
the thrashing continues
edward somehow fights his way back to his feet ready to be knocked down again
don is about to slug edward again when he turns
sandra pulls off her engagement ring
theres an audible ahh
from her sisters and an ohh
from dons brothers
i will never marry you
don stands stunned his mind reeling
edward whose eyes are swollen almost shut keeps waiting for the next punch
where is it
whats going on
you love this guy
hes almost a stranger and i prefer him to you
she hands him the ring
another beat then don storms off
but not before decking edward one last time
sandra leans over edwards broken body
his head lies on the daffodils
how can i convince you to stop
go out with me
he smiles his teeth bloody
as the crowd of students applauds and cheers we crane up above the flowered battlefield
as it turned out sandra was able to keep her same date at the chapel
only the groom had changed
as the music reaches a crescendo we suddenly
i thought you said you didnt have a church wedding
well we were all set to but there was a complication
he reaches for his glass of water but josephine already has it for him
she watches him while he slowly drinks the entire glass thirstier than he imagined
while hes drinking we
will back from the grocery store reaches the top of the stairs
he hears voices coming from the bedroom
is it the medicine thats making you thirsty
truth is ive been thirsty my whole life
never really known why
will quietly approaches the door not exactly sneaking but not exactly announcing his presence
the door is open a few inches letting him look in on his father and his wife
there was one time when i was eleven
gently you were talking about your wedding
i didnt forget
i was just working on a tangent
see most men theyll tell a story straight through and it wont be complicated but it wont be interesting either
i like your stories
and i like you
he doesnt let the moment linger with undue sentimentality
theres a story to be told
the thing about working for a circus is you dont have a regular address and after three years i had a lot of undelivered mail
in the hallway will shifts to a new position letting himself listen to the story one more time
during the four weeks i was in the hospital the postmaster finally caught up with me
bruised and bandaged edward sorts through a big bag of mail with help from sandra
he rips open an official looking letter
reading it his face drops
flute and drum music rising to a military cadence
it turned out that while my heart belonged to sandra the rest of my body belonged to the u
with a buzz cut and paratrooper gear edward squats with a dozen other soldiers
the noise of the engines is deafening but edward is engrossed in an asian phrasebook
a hitch in the army was up to three years at that point and having waited three years just to meet sandra i knew i couldnt survive being away from
her that long
so i took every hazardous assignment i could find with the hope of getting my time down to less than a year
the jump leader yells
one by one the men jump out their chutes clipped to a main line
when his time comes edward leaps
but hes stuck
his cord is caught up in the assembly
he twists and struggles trying to free himself
looking down he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the darkness
theyre already long gone
digging a knife out of his pocket edward gets to work cutting through the cable
it finally pops
edward jumps from the plane
a thousand chinese soldiers sit bored watching the equivalent of a u
a chinese ventriloquist is on stage with his communist puppet
we have no idea what theyre saying to each other but every act is fundamentally the same
the emcee comes on to usher him off the stage before hes finished
the ventriloquist protests but finally gives in
the emcee makes a shoot him in the neck motion to one of the armed guards off stage
we look down with edward who is drifting right for the stage
he cant steer
but then a blast of fireworks from the sides of the stage
the lights go out as a drum roll begins
its just enough cover for edward to remain unseen
he lands with a clang on the lighting catwalk above the stage
he barely grabs on disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up
edward looks out at the sea of excited soldiers
every one of them would kill him
hes the legless cricket left on the anthill
the curtain rises to reveal ping at a microphone
shes as gorgeous a woman as youll ever see
she stands with her hips turned in profile
her body is a knockout dress cut to reveal skin
the soldiers are on their feet whistling and hollering
up on the catwalk edward is surprised by an enemy soldier
the two men begin to scuffle
music starts a vampy torch song
ping sings melody while an off stage voice carries perfect harmony
sometimes a girl can feel so alone without a lover to call her own
sometimes its so bad she wants to explode
wants to grab the first man she sees and tear off his clothes
a roar from the soldiers
she knows what they want
still fighting edward jumps for a pole on the far side of the catwalk sliding down it to end up his determined opponent follows him down
but she wont
no she cant
she needs a special special different unusual man
because that girl who looks like me she has wants but she has needs
speaking any of you got needs
the soldiers roar louder stomping on the bleachers
backstage the two men are still fighting
chorus ive had twice the adventure cried double the tears
two times the bad times in half the years
i need a strong man because ive got twice the love to give
for the first time ping turns and now we see why she was standing in profile
ping is one half of her identical twin is jing whos been singing harmony all this time
they are two separate women who join at the waist one set of perfect legs beneath them
edward sees the twins from behind does a double take
it costs him a punch to the jaw
say hello jing
to the crowd im ping
shes the good one
closer im the bad one
as the music builds towards the climax edward finishes the fight knocking the guard out with a right hook
as ping and jing reach the last chorus they strike a final pose in the shape of a heart their arms forming the arches their backs forming the curves
edward slips behind curtains trying to get away
the soldiers are shouting for an encore lighters waving
the curtain slowly lowers revealing the applause dies replaced by a concerned rumble
the emcee yells for the guards to search
ping has no idea whats happening
jing reaches into her cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses
as armed guards search the halls below the stage ping and jing shut the door to their dressing room
at the closet they start to change outfits
off stage their personalities become quite apparent ping is brash bitchy and ambitious while jing is quiet sweet and bookish
in chinese subtitled
how could you miss your cue
you make me look like a fool out there alone
you werent alone
ping huffs turning her back on her sister
jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress exposing edwards hiding place
ping turns to look
who the hell are you
in chinese im not going to hurt you
damn right youre not
yelling jing grabs her a hand over her mouth but its too late
a rifle toting guard looks in
pretending to be her bitchy sister tell your men not to bother us
and lock that door
the guard obeys
ping shakes her sister off
desperately flipping through his asian phrasebook he finds
please i need your help
what makes you think well help you
edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket
over the next hour i described my love for sandra kay templeton and the ordeal that brought me before them
as it had always been this love was my salvation
it was destined to be
hearing the story jing wipes away a tear
even ping is a little affected
we put together an elaborate plan for escape involving a whaling ship to russia a barge to cuba and a small dirty canoe to miami
we all knew it would be dangerous
still subtitled and what are we supposed to do when we get to america
i can get you bookings
i know the biggest man in show business
sandra checks the mail hoping for a letter from edward
and so the twins and i began our arduous journey halfway around the world
unfortunately there was no way to send a message back to america
a black car pulls up
two army officers get out
and so it was no surprise that the army believed i was dead
hearing the news sandra cries out
the pain of her shout makes church bells ring
sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines forming a tunnel of fabric
after four months sandra had gotten over the worst of the nightmares
when the phone rang she didnt think it was somehow me calling her
when a car drove past she didnt get up to check out the window
pulling a dress out of the basket sandra looks up to see on the sheet in front of her
she freezes watching the shadow ripple across the white fabric blowing so softly in the breeze
she knows it cant be him
she turns away
with all the strength she can gather she hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket
looking up she sees not a shadow but edward himself standing before her
she gasps disbelieving but his hand is real
it is destiny
without another moments hesitation she kisses him
filters through soft sheets
were under the covers where a mans hand traces the curves of a womans bare back
a beat then she turns over in bed revealing her to be she blinks slowly just waking up
will is watching her
hes been up for a while
we are actually
where the couple stays cocooned under the sheets a kind of limbo
a kiss good morning
neither wants to get up
i talked with your father last night
a look to say should i be worried
you never told me how your parents met
they met at auburn
what about the details
how they fell in love
you never told me any of that
thats because most of it never happened
but its romantic
non committal mmm
i know better than to argue romance with a french woman
he moves his head out from under the sheet
she follows him to the outside
do you love your father
everyone loves my father
hes a very likeable guy
repeating do you love him
will doesnt want to answer yes or no
you have to understand
when i was growing up he was gone more than he was here
and i started thinking maybe he has a second life somewhere else
with another house another family
he leaves us he goes to them
or maybe there is no family
maybe he never wanted a family
but whatever it is maybe he likes that second life better
and the reason he tells all those stories is because he cant stand this boring place
but its not true
what is true
ive never heard my father say a single true thing
off her silence
look i know why you like him
i know why everyone likes him
but i need you to tell me im not crazy
i need you on my side
i am always on your side
and i think you should talk to him
the family finishes eating breakfast off tv trays set up around the bed
for his part edward is looking better
certainly not recovered but theres an optimism to his expression
and for the first time hes actually hungry
he watches as sandra puts the cap back on the syrup
did i ever tell you about how
edward is startled
the maple tree and the buick
we heard it
re josephine i think someone hasnt
the tree fell on the car spilling the syrup which attracted the flies which got stuck to it and flew off with the whole car
undeterred but the real story is how i got the car
can we talk
sandra snaps the cap back on the syrup
im going to get started on dishes
ill help you
both women quickly gather plates
will and edward both smile
the women clearly want this to happen
it settles for a beat after they leave
do you know much about icebergs dad
i saw an iceberg once
they were hauling it down to texas for drinking water only they didnt count on an elephant being frozen inside
the woolly kind
im trying to make a metaphor here
then you shouldnt have started with a question
because people want to answer questions
you should have started with the thing about icebergs is
frustrated the thing about icebergs is you only see percent of them
the other percent is below the water where you cant see it
and thats what it is with you dad
im only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water
joking what youre seeing down to my nose
i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact
ive told you a thousand facts
thats all i do will
i tell stories
you tell lies dad
you tell amusing lies
stories are what you tell a five year old at bedtime
theyre not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty
and the thing is i believed you
i believed your stories so much longer than i should have
and then when i realized that everything you said was impossible everything
i felt like such a fool to have trusted you
you were like santa claus and the easter bunny combined
just as charming and just as fake
you think im fake
only on the surface
but thats all ive ever seen
edward looks away angry and disbelieving
dad im about to have a kid of my own here
it would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me
it would kill you huh
finally what do you want will
who do you want me to be
good bad everything
just show me who you are for once
i have been nothing but myself since the day i was born
and if you cant see that its your failing not mine
with a skimmer pole will cleans the leaves and debris out of the pool but its a fools errand
the pool has long since gone native a shiny slick of algae on the surface slime covering the cemented rocks
suddenly an underwater shape ripples against the waters surface
will is so startled that he drops the pole which disappears into the murky water
he looks around relieved that no one saw that
he casually walks away
the doors open to reveal sandra will and josephine staring into the mouth of oblivion
the storeroom is a museum of hasty decisions and half finished projects partially built outboard motors dead bonsai trees frankensteinian lawnmowers
we also find boxes of products edward used to sell
clearing a path sandra leads will to a roll top desk its ribs covered in dust
two beaten metal file cabinets sit beside it
your father decided he needed to have an office and it wouldnt do to have it in the house
youll know better than me whats important
with some effort will forces up the desktop
with a hiss a neighbors cat makes a run for it
wills getting used to being startled
will sandra and josephine have worked through two trash bags of papers to throw out
looking through a new file sandra makes a small sound
what is it
sandra hands will a yellowed telegram
he shares it with josephine
it was during the war
your father went missing
they thought he was dead
will cant believe what hes reading
that really happened
not everything your father says is a complete fabrication
a beat then sandra stands
im going to check on him
i need to lie down for a bit
josephine kisses him then follows sandra
will re reads the telegram still bewildered
looking for a place to put it he tucks it into a strange mechanical hand on the desk
it clamps down automatically
will smiles a memory
he hasnt thought about this device in years
we slowly push in on the telegram held in the hand
edwards voice begins as a memory
after the war the sons of alabama returned home looking for work
each had an advantage over me
they were alive while i was officially deceased
edward shakes hands with his new boss a toupeed man
the company is called confederated products
the office ladies all love edward
with my prospects few i took a job as a travelling salesman
it suited me
if theres one thing you can say about edward bloom its that i am a social person
on a low platform edward pitches a brilliant new product to the crowd
ive travelled from tennessee to timbuktu and if theres one thing people have in common is we could all use a hand around the house
edward sets down a contraption which looks something like a metal lava lamp
like a flower it unfolds to reveal five fingers and a thumb
this is the hand around the house
tm why with this product you can
quick montage as he demonstrates open a jar
open a letter
scratch yourself while wearing mittens
hold a book
hold a baby
hold the dog away from kittens
its strong enough you can do a handstand with no hands at all
indeed a remarkably agile edward is able to support his entire weight on it
the crowd applauds
you can use it to point out important information
or beautiful women
the hand points a finger at an heavyset man in overalls
were still working on that one
the crowd laughs
edward drives his hand out in the wind
soon i added other products and other cities until my territory stretched from the coast to western texas
edward kisses his pregnant wife goodbye as much in love as ever
i could be gone for weeks at a time
but every other friday id put all the money id made into an account set aside for a proper house with a white picket fence
establishing this texas institution we come
the bank is busy with the lunch hour crowd
taking his place in line edward fills out a deposit slip
as the line snakes around through the ropes the man in front of him gets a look at edward
the man is none other than
i was astonished to see the greatest poet of both ashton and spectre all the way out in texas
the men shake disbelieving this lucky coincidence
i dont believe it
i want you to know when you left spectre it opened my eyes
there was a whole life out there that i was not living
so i travelled
i saw france and africa half of south america
every day a new adventure thats my motto
thats great norther
im happy for you
i cant believe i helped
hes genuinely proud
so what are you up to now
im robbing this place
reaching the front of the line norther pulls two pistols out of his coat firing both into the ceiling
screams all around
the skinny security guard makes a halfhearted reach for his gun but norther waves him off
the guard takes out his gun and slides it over
to edward would you mind grabbing that
theres nothing threatening about his delivery he might as well be asking for a budweiser
still edward senses it would be best to do as he says
he takes the guards gun
to the crowd now i want all of you to lie down
im gonna be cleaning out the cash drawers and my associate here is going to handle the vault
pointing to a teller woman you help my friend okay
the teller woman nods
angle on edward not sure what to do
he has a gun but he truly doesnt want to shoot norther
the teller woman is already waving him to the back
he decides he better go
the teller woman is crying as she works the combination
edward feels horrible
look im really sorry
i just dont want anybody to get hurt
its not that its just
she pulls open the vault door
the inner sanctum of the horizon savings and loan holds exactly one folding chair
theres no money
were completely bankrupt
it turned out the savings and loan had already been robbed not by armed bandits but by speculators in texas real estate
dead serious you gotta promise you wont tell anybody
edward drives the getaway car though truthfully theyre going just a little over the speed limit
no ones following them
its an empty country road for miles
norther hollers with body tingling joy as he counts the money
four hundred dollars
not bad for just the drawers
lets see what you got from the vault
edward winces but doesnt say anything yet
digging through the vault bag norther is surprised to find only a single deposit envelope
he rips it open revealing just a little cash inside
even some dimes and pennies
this is it
the whole vault
edward its got your deposit slip on it
caught edward has to confess
look i just didnt want you to go empty handed
theres something you should know norther
you see the reason why
edward continues his narration
i told norther about the vagaries of texas oil money and its effect on real estate prices and how lax enforcement of fiduciary process had made savings and loans particularly
hearing this news norther was left with one conclusion norther leans in the drivers side window
i should go to wall street
thats where all the money is
edward looks over at norther the reality sinking in
i knew then that while my days as a criminal were over northers were just beginning
the two men wave at each other as edward drives off
at the last moment norther calls out edward thank you for the hand
hes talking about his hand around the house
we hold on norther for a beat dreaming of his future
when norther made his first million dollars he sent me a check for ten thousand
i protested but he said it was my fee as his career advisor
sandra is watering the garden
will runs past her to greet edward just returned from another trip
ten thousand dollars is no fortune to most men
but it was enough to buy my wife a proper house with a white picket fence
we reveal the bloom house the nicest one in the neighborhood
edward kisses his wife
and for that it was all the riches a man could ever want
sandra drops the hose letting it run on the lawn
close on edwards hand as he turns knobs
close on water splashing into the claw foot bathtub which begins to fill
still wearing his pajamas edward climbs into the tub
carefully lowers himself
as the water reaches the third button up on his pajama shirt edward suddenly slides bubbles rise from his nose for a few beats then stop
its quiet except for the distant splashing of water from the spigot
edwards eyes are closed
a long beat
then the splashing water goes silent
edward opens one eye
the other eye
he sits up to find sitting on the edge of the tub
she doesnt seem particularly worried her husband has always done this
i was drying out
we need to get you one of those plant misters
we can spray you like a fern
he smiles then pulls his knees up making room for her in the tub
a beat while she considers
sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub facing him
her dress is soaked but she doesnt mind
he leans forward and kisses her
when they separate she has tears hanging in her eyes
he wipes them away
i dont think ill ever dry out
perched awkwardly on a canoe wills made it through another file cabinet
he goes through the folders page by page but usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash
hes about to toss a file when he stops
takes another look
something doesnt make sense
will is headed upstairs when his mother comes around the corner with an armful of laundry including her wet dress
is he awake
he just fell asleep
josephines with him
she passes him
will quickly debates whether or not to ask her
did you and dad have any other property
thinking i suppose your grandmothers house when she passed on
but we sold that right away
your cousin shirley bought it
so you never bought any land
we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place
will nods just curious
he continues heading up
will changes his shirt
takes his keys off the nightstand
wills rental car drives past a sign reading ashton miles
will checks the address on one of his fathers files
will talks to the attendant who points him in a direction then gestures a series of left right left rights
will drives down a road that seems somewhat familiar
and then we realize why a roadsign reads welcome to spectre
sitting at the edge of a swamp the little two story feels lonely set deep in its lot
dapples of light break through the trees a light breeze swaying the branches
as will walks from the car the whirr of cicadas grows
he checks the number
this is the house
it is surrounded by a white square picket fence identical to his mothers
will notices this
reaching the porch we hear a piano playing inside
re checking the number on a form hes carrying will knocks
the piano stops
go back to the start
right hand only
the piano starts again
the door opens to reveal a blonde woman in her s the woman from the grocery store
her name is jenny hill
she and will are startled to see each other
i wasnt expecting you
confused will checks the name on the form
are you jenny hill
and youre will
ive seen your picture thats how i recognize you
i almost said something at the store but it would have been awkward
a beat like this
the piano student a black boy of eight has stopped
hes watching the conversation at the door
speaking of awkward
to the student listen kenny
why dont we skip the lesson today
we can go again next week
she hands him five dollars out of her pocket
do i have to give it back to my mom
i wont tell her if you wont
you dont have to tell him twice
hes out the door in a flash
while will sips his iced tea jenny flips through a form she never expected to see again
she hands it back to will
how did you know my father
this was on his sales route so he was through here all the time
everyone in town knew him
were you and my father having an affair
taken aback wow
wow you just said it
i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour
ive seen him with women
he always has
on some level i presumed he was cheating on my mother
i just never had proof
she moves trying to get out of the corner hes boxed her into
once shes finally free
can i ask you a question
why did you come here today
if you found this deed why didnt you just ask eddie
because hes dying
a long beat
jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it
shes a tangle of conflicting emotions
look i dont know how much you want to know about any of this
you have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it
especially this late in the game
my father talked about a lot of things he never did and im sure he did a lot of things he never talked about
im just trying to reconcile the two
jenny takes a seat across from him at the table
the first thing you have to understand is that your father never meant to end up here
and yet he did twice
the first time he was early
the second time he was late
its late and edward is pensive
those days your father was working for himself
if there was one thing you could say about edward bloom its that he was a social person and people took a liking to him
one night he was returning from three weeks on the road when he hit a thunderstorm unlike any in his life
the first raindrops hit the windshield
edward turns on the wipers
suddenly a deluge descends
its not even rain anymore theres no space between the drops
its like being caught in a waterfall
its that loud
no choice edward stops the car
puts on the handbrake
just as suddenly the sound changes no longer pounding but softly splashing
the world is close and echoing because the car is underwater
the tires are still on the road but where there used to be air is water
three catfish swim in front of his headlights
realizing his plight edward tries to remain calm
water is trickling in through the crack between the window and the door but very slowly
for now hes fine
thats when he sees her the girl in the river
shes swimming outside the car
while we never see her face exactly she remains just as beautiful just as mysterious as the first time we saw her
she puts her hand to the windshield
he puts his up to meet hers
its morning and the sun shines brightly
trees drip and the grass shines still wet from last nights rain
edward gathers the clothes that have spilled out of his suitcase which broke open when he dropped it from which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree
as edward gathers his last pair of socks he notices a shiny piece of metal sticking out of the dirt
he pulls it out rubs it off
its a key
its the key to the city he lost years ago
fate has a way of circling back on a man and taking him by surprise
carrying his busted suitcase a tired edward walks toward a one street town in the distance
we pass a rusty sign
welcome to spectre
amazed and disbelieving edward walks down the center of the road no cars coming from either direction
he looks up to find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line along with the rest of the towns
a man sees things differently at different times in his life
this town didnt seem the same now that he was older
we look around the town on and off main street
there are for sale signs in many of the windows a new road had brought the outside world to spectre and with it banks liens and debt
almost everywhere you looked people were bankrupt
we slowly move through a foreclosure auction to find edward watching
two very corporate men in suits stick out among the bidders
two different corporations were looking at buying the town if they could get the price low enough
one wanted to open a chicken processing plant
the other a municipal dump
either way spectre would be destroyed
edward raises his hand
everyone turns to look at this new bidder
and so edward bloom decided to buy the town in order to save it
edward pitches his plan to norther
he was never a wealthy man but he had made other men rich and now he asked for their favors
various shots expressive and passionate as always edward talks to ping jing and amos calloway
most of them had never seen spectre they only had edwards words to describe it
thats all they needed
he sold them on the dream
you can structure it as a historical trust
but youll need every contiguous piece of property
its all or nothing
as edward takes notes
so first he bought the farms
then he bought the houses
then he bought the stores
finishing up with al edward shakes hands
whatever he bought the people were not asked to leave or pay rent or anything
they were just asked to keep doing as they were doing
in that way he could make sure the town would never die
edward climbs out of his car the road having literally stopped
the sun is shining but it can barely penetrate the trees thick canopy
within six months his trust had purchased the entire town
with one exception
in the distance he sees a shack so old its nearly fallen
he walks toward it the marshy ground squishing up around his feet soaking the hems of his trousers
we hear a piano playing from inside the shack
edward knocks on the half hung door which swings open by itself
the inside is nicer than youd think a real home
a fire burns in the stove and curtains hang in the windows
with her back turned to him jenny hill plays the piano
edward doesnt recognize her as the little girl who used to have a crush on him
without turning she says
you must be edward bloom
how did you know
she keeps playing
no one would come out here unless they had business
and no one would have business with me except for you
youre buying the town
apparently ive overlooked this one piece of it and id like to remedy that
you see in order for the town to be preserved the trust must own it in its entirety
so ive heard
ill offer you more than its worth
and you know you wont have to move
nothing will change except the name on the deed you have my word
jenny stops playing her piece not quite finished
she turns to face him
edward still doesnt recognize her
now let me get this straight
youll buy the swamp from me but ill stay in it
youll own the house but itll still be mine
ill be here and youll come and go as you please to one place or another
do i have that right
strange to hear it put that way but in so many words yes
then i dont think so mr
if nothing is going to change id just as soon it not change in the way it hasnt been changing all this time
its not like youre going to lose anything
you can ask anyone in town
ive been nothing if not generous
i want the best for everyone
a long beat
bloom why are you buying this land
some sort of midlife crisis
instead of buying a convertible you buy a town
he looks at her puzzled and surprised
no one has really asked before
helping people makes me happy
im not convinced you should be happy
have i offended you
she finally turns to face him
no you did exactly what you promised
you came back
i was just expecting you sooner
young jenny hill watches barefoot edward leave spectre for the first time
finally realizing who this woman is
youre beamens daughter
your last name is different
realizing you married
turns out that was a big difference
before he can say anything more
i wont be selling you this house mr
i thank you for your time
a bit bewildered edward tips his hat to her as he leaves
edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves but it breaks off in his hands
its not the clean exit he was hoping for
inside jenny looks out surprised and annoyed
edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges but they snap off
the door frame buckles and the whole shack creaks
he tries to lean the door against the frame but it keeps slipping
its okay just leave it
i can get it
i can just
he leans the door a different way
it holds for a beat then falls in smashing a small table
lord im sorry i
shes dead serious
weighing the scales of chivalry he finally backs away
turns and heads back towards his car
we stay on jenny watching him go
shes furious but theres something more in her feelings for him
most men in that situation would accept their failure and move on
but edward was not like most men
with karl the giants help edward unloads a brand new door from a pickup truck
while jenny watches half annoyed half amused edward tries to set the door square
karl pushes against the side of the house until it fits
holding nails between his lips edward puts in new windows himself
jenny is making soup laughing at the story hes telling
as the months passed he found more and more things to fix until the shack no longer resembled itself
edward and karl cut down a tree letting in a flood of light
through the golden pollen hanging in the air we rise up to see the shack is now we saw before
its tiny and white with black shutters and a steep roof
a white picket fence
in every detail it is impossibly charming
edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer
jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story
and watching him with deepest affection
of course the best part was creating new material
by the time the twins and i got to havana we had a whole new routine worked out for them with just a ukulele and a harmonica
finished with his work he takes his hat off the chair and hangs it on the rack
a look between them
with that last job done theres no reason for him to be staying any longer
i suppose i should
he takes his hat off the rack
you can leave it there
does she really mean it
she comes closer
edward holds his ground
she takes his hand lifting his hat up to the peg
shes very close just a half inch from kissing him when edward gently holds her back
she freezes stunned and humiliated
she pulls away
dont be embarrassed
i should never have let you think that
beat i am in love with my wife
and from the moment i saw her until the moment i die shes the only one
im sorry jenny
with that he begins to leaves
she finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house
hands it to him
with a look he thanks her
edward takes a final look at this perfect little town
one day edward bloom left and never returned to the town hed saved
he climbs in his car and starts the engine
as we watch the swamp begins to overtake the house swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches
shoots burst up through the planks in the porch
snakes slither through the marsh
day becomes night
as for the girl the common belief was that shed become a witch and crazy at that
she became something of a legend herself
we reverse to find four kids looking in through the rusty iron gate with flashlights
a beat then they run away
and the story ended where it began
will and jenny are still sitting at her table a pitcher of iced tea between them
logically you couldnt be the witch because she was old back when he was young
no its logical if you think like your father
see to him theres only two women your mother and everyone else
you didnt become crazy
and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back
i was living in a fairy tale
will smiles to hear it called that
people arent like they are in stories
they hurt each other without meaning to
they are kind and unbelievably cruel at the same moment
like me now
im not sure i should have told you any of this
her composure is starting to break
no i wanted to know
im glad i know
a long beat both staring at their iced tea
jenny is working herself into more of a state by not talking
i wanted to meet you for the longest time
a smile i envied you so much
the way eddie would talk about you when you were at missouri that award you won
and when you got the job at the a
everything he was so proud of you
i mean thats the thing
every moment he loved you
shes fighting tears not the first ones shes shed over this
and as brightly as the sun would shine when he was with me every time he left it disappeared
i wanted to be as important to him as you were and i was never going to be
i was make believe and his other life you were real
angle on will sorting through his swirling thoughts
you knew that didnt you
will skips through the stations on the radio but ultimately turns it off
hes trying to think
will walks up the front steps
theres a subtle change to his expression a dark cloud lifted
he unlocks the door
its half dark and quiet in the house no talking no tv
will sets his keys on the table
will looks in
calling out hello
we follow will looking into his and josephines room
he aims for the guest room at the end of the hall
looking over his shoulder we see his fathers bed is empty
the sheets are in a tangle on the floor
a beat then will half runs back down the hall
back down the stairs
headed out will grabs his keys off the table
we look right where the message light blinks on the answering machine
the hospital is so new its not even finished thick plastic hangs from exposed framing
theres no one at the information desk so will forges ahead
will reads a directory board trying to decide the best place to start
then behind him will
he turns to see his wife at a payphone
she hangs up
she was calling him
your father had a stroke
hes upstairs with your mom and dr
is he going to be okay
how can she answer
he half smiles realizing the idiocy of his question
of course his fathers not going to be okay
what i mean is will he get back to the way he was when
she cuts him off no
and like that its done
we hold on will reeling from the news
edward sleeps peacefully just an oxygen tube under his nose
there are no beeping monitors no blinking lights
its mercifully quiet
sandra squeezes wills hand tightly
shes holding herself together but its been a tough day
bennett has just gone through the details for the third time
i dont suppose one of us could stay with him
in case he
beat in case he wakes up one of us should be there
why dont you go home with josephine and ill stay tonight
bennett thats okay
to will youll call if
mom do you want some time with dad
a nod then will holds the door for dr
bennett and josephine as they leave
sandra is alone in the room with her husband
she neatens his hair
holds his hand
as she kisses his fingers she tweaks her chin with them his signature move
sandra waits outside the womens restroom
her face is a study in strained composure acknowledging the inevitable but refusing to surrender to it
it seems every hour i have to
it was the same when i was carrying will
the two women start to walk no hurry
do you like it being pregnant
i loved it
it sounds peculiar but i loved every minute of it
eddie was travelling a lot so he was gone but i felt like i always had a piece of him with me
a little part of his soul inside me
i could feel it
it was alive and kicking
sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion
she struggles to keep it in check
almost a whisper
i really miss that
with a few breaths sandra tries to hold on
a beat then sandra finally melts
josephine holds her
the two women stand together in the hallway letting the moment be
will sits in a chair beside the bed working through the crossword puzzle
a knock as dr
bennett enters with his overcoat and bag ready to leave for the night
glad to see youre not trying to have a heartfelt talk
its one of my greatest annoyances when people talk to those who cant hear them
my father and i have an advantage
we never talk
bennett smiles as he checks edwards chart
how long have you known my father
how would you describe him
re chart five eleven
beat how would his son describe him
tables turned will searches for an answer
he doesnt have one
bennett hangs the chart back on the bed
did your father ever tell you about the day you were born
a thousand times
he caught an uncatchable fish
not that one
the real story
did he ever tell you that
suddenly interested no
your mother came in about three in the afternoon
her neighbor drove her on account of your father was on business in wichita
you were born a week early but there were no complications
it was a perfect delivery
now your father was sorry to miss it but it wasnt the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then so i cant see as it
would have been much different had he been there
and thats the real story of how you were born
a long silence just the sounds of the hospital doctors being paged
not very exciting is it
and i suppose if i had to choose between the true version and an elaborate one involving a fish and a wedding ring i might choose the fancy version
but thats just me
will half smiles
patting wills shoulder dr
we stay on will and his father for a long time then will takes his pen and starts making a list
will flips to a new page
the list keeps getting longer
he smiles remembering something
on his fourth page he looks up at his motionless father
a beat then we slowly its very early morning and the first blue light of day is glowing through the vertical blinds
still in his chair will wakes up a bit at a time
the notepad is on his lap the pen in his hand
he cracks his neck crooked from sleeping on it wrong
what woke him up
he looks to his right
holds his gaze for a breath
his father is awake silently gasping for breath
his eyes are open scared and confused
do you want me to get a nurse
edward shakes his head unambiguously
will already has his finger on the orange nurse call button but doesnt push it
what can i do
can i help
can i get you something
will pours a glass from the pitcher on the nightstand
he holds it to his fathers lips but edward wont drink
he pushes it away
he wanted something else
whispering the river
it takes edward all his strength to put together each thought
its like hes only half there fighting to hang on to this world
tell me how it happens
how what happens
how i go
on will realizing
you mean what you saw in the eye
yes thats what he was trying to say
a long beat
i dont know that story dad
you never told me that one
will pushes his fingers under his fathers heavy hand and holds it
theres nothing else to do
edward looks around confused and increasingly scared
he sees the end approaching but doesnt know exactly whats coming
without the story hes lost
fighting the urge to panic i can try dad
if you help
just tell me how it starts
will looks around the room increasingly desperate
he looks to the nurse call button
he really wants to press it
on edward waiting for will to begin
its morning and you and i are in the hospital
id fallen asleep in the chair
i wake up and i see you and
its dawn and the first golden glow is shining through the vertical blinds
louder and concerned dad
we look over to find a nimble edward sitting up in bed combing his hair
lets get out of here
somehow youre better
youre getting ready to go
and i say
dad youre in no condition to
but edward throws back the covers
theres a fold up wheelchair in the bathroom
wrap a blanket around me
as soon as we get off this floor well be in the clear
will heads for the bathroom
sure enough the wheelchair is there
we dont have much time
with the blanket draped over his head like a ghost edward points for his son to steer the wheelchair thataway
they pass a heavyset nurse who turns to look
rounding a corner they nearly crash into dr
what are you doing
before he can answer will spots edward rolling the chair himself pumping both arms
will dashes to catch up with him
the heavyset nurse leans out of edwards hospital room
at the elevators sandra and josephine step out to find will and edward barreling straight at them
no time to explain
seeing security guards heading their way a quick thinking sandra shoves a nearby cart into them bowling them down
will brakes hard sliding with both feet
the chair nearly crashes into the back wall as the doors close
will races edward down the row finally reaching the chevrolet
will lifts his father out of the chair
i pick you up and you hardly weigh anything
i cant explain it
will sets him in the passenger seat
i need water
scrambling in back will finds a liter of arrowhead
hands it off
edward unscrews the cap but instead of drinking it he douses himself
soaks the blanket
will pops the trunk
starts to fold up the wheelchair
we wont need it
tires smoke as the car peals out
tight on will trying to hold back tears as he talks
and we have to take glenville to avoid all the church traffic because those damn church people drive too slow
tight on edward enjoying that detail
hes focused completely on wills story
the chevy slaloms through the sunday morning traffic
where are we headed
will stops short the traffic backed up
he honks trying to get around the jam
but its no use
then up ahead the cars start moving shoved aside by massive hands
its karl the giant clearing a path by brute force
edward leans out the window and waves
karl waves back
the same stretch of the river where it all began
a crowd of more than waiting
as we get closer to the river we see everybodys already there
and i mean everybody
amos calloway is here with the circus folk including mr
we also find edwards mother and father the mayor and many others from along the way
no one has aged a day since we saw them last
while ping scans the horizon jing nuzzles with her boyfriend norther winslow
its ping who first spots the chevrolet
the crowd cheers
the ashton marching band plays
jenny hill smiles
so does the old woman
we push in on the old womans glass eye where we see
this is what he saw
amazed will turns to his father
story of my life
will gets out of the chevrolet overwhelmed by the crowd
behind him sandra josephine and dr
bennett pull up
karl comes just after that
crossing to the passenger side will lifts his father out
strangely hes gotten even lighter
will carries him easily
edward pulls off his shoes tying the laces together
he hands them to josephine
she throws them up at the powerline
they loop over
applause and cheers
the crowd parts to let will and edward get to the river
as he passes edward shakes some hands pats some people on the cheek and gives others a good poke in the ribs
and the strange thing is theres not a sad face to be found
everyones just so glad to see you and send you off right
will walks into the river up to his knees
he turns back so his father can face the crowd
well miss you
but one face is missing from the crowd sandra
will turns to see shes already standing in the river beside them
the reflection of the light off the water gives sandra an unearthly glow
shes more tranquil and more beautiful than weve ever seen her
my girl in the river
she kisses him
he tweaks her chin
the crowd hollers in approval but their moment remains strangely private
only will is there to witness
as the kiss ends edward tries to pull off his wedding ring
but its stuck
finally he sucks on it pulling it free with his teeth
a look to will a smile with a glint of gold
will takes the ring out of his mouth
edward suddenly drops out of wills arms with a splash
for hes no longer a man but rather swimming at his feet
we watch as the catfish circles then heads for deeper water disappearing
will and his mother stand knee deep in the water watching edward bloom swim away into the sunlight
josephine is back on the shore along with the entire crowd
music builds to a climax then
down the river a giant fish suddenly jumps out of the water cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset
it then dives back under with a splash
will has tears hanging in the corners of his eyes
you become what you always were
a very big fish
he smiles and thats the way it happens
a whisper yes
edward smiles proud of both of them
his eyes are so pale and so open we can almost see his soul
in every atom of his body in every thought edward bloom is entirely happy
and this is how he goes
will shuts the door to his fathers room behind him
the walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime
he finds a quarter starts to dial
he has to squint to see through the water in his eyes
the other end answers
voice cracking hi
thats all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him
he presses closer to the phone trying to shield himself
music begins that will carry us through the next passage
will waits at reception as sandra and josephine come off the elevator
josephine opens the curtains letting white sunlight in
she strips the bed
will and his mother pick out one of edwards ties for will to wear at the funeral
will tries to button the cuffs on the shirt he borrowed but theyre the kind that need links
he goes through the top drawer of the dresser trying to find a matching pair
further down he finds a ribbon tied to he smiles disbelieving
its a real thing
will helps his mother out of a black sedan
shes well composed not nearly the wreck we might have expected
josephine hugs dr
bennett and shakes hands with his wife
the service is crowded more than people many more than expected
as his mother talks to a well wisher will looks left to see an oldsmobile parking
close on the license plates
the passenger side opens but the man who steps out is barely visible over the door
he shuts it to reveal himself to be
its amos calloway
will doesnt recognize him
the driver climbs out a size foot on the gravel
we tilt up to see this man is huge
this man is karl now
hes not feet tall but at least six eight
close on will bewildered to see that this man really exists
as the service gets ready to begin will guides his mother to a seat near the grave
sitting beside will josephine spots a stunning asian woman behind them
a beat later an identical face with glasses peers out the womans twin sister
its ping and jing
josephine almost gasps
she elbows will who turns to look
from this angle the sisters seem conjoined but then jing steps forward
theyre really two separate people
a sea of familiar faces all of them aged through the years beamen norther winslow the mayor and zacky price
after the service we see the crowd gathered in small groups
by the laughter and hand gestures we can see theyre telling stories
theyre telling edwards stories
we find will watching them
have you ever heard a joke so many times youve forgotten why its funny
but then you hear it again and suddenly its new
you remember why you loved it in the first place
will joins in laughing
we slowly circle behind a monument letting it black out the screen
will sits on the porch with sandra and josephine watching his son play in the pool with two neighbor kids
to the other boys so he said hed fight the giant who was fifteen feet tall
calling over dad thats right isnt it
something like that
so he was a giant but my grampa was going to fight him because he wasnt afraid of anything because hed seen how he was going to die in this
old ladys glass eye
will smiles as his son continues the tale which fades
sandra takes wills hand in hers just listening
that was my fathers final joke i guess
a man tells his stories so many times he becomes the stories
they live on after him
a fat and happy catfish swims towards us
and in that way he becomes immortal
the fish passes us with a splash
