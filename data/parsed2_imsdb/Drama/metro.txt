roper walks over to the counter where baffert is standing

roper opens it
this guy is no genius
roper scans the profile
theyre not usually graduate students
swat wants to go in

beat give me a dozen donuts
roper pulls out his gun and places it on the counter
roper eats the donut as he crosses toward the bank
a team of two swat team members forbes is a spotter and mccall is a sharpshooter
kevin mccall is the one were interested in
hes years old handsome all american
hes the best the swat team has
he crouches motionless staring through the scope of his rifle watching as roper calmly walks toward the bank
what do you think hes got in the bag
you cant take a guy down with a donut
a tense situation
a wild eyed white punk fuck up of a bank robber earl is holding a pretty young teller around the neck with a cocked gun held to her temple
the other bank employees are cowering on the floor
a few are giving aid to the wounded bank guard who is half conscious and oozing blood from his side
roper strolls right through the front door and walks toward earl very sociable
hi earl im scott roper
i ate the glazed but theres a bunch of chocolate and a earl swipes the donuts out of ropers hand and starts frisking roper for weapons with his free hand
the other hand still has the gun poised at the young tellers head
im a negotiator earl
i dont carry a weapon
roper smiles reassuringly at the pretty teller
it seems to help
earl finishes patting roper down straightens back up and puts his hand around the tellers neck
wheres the car
i need to get something straight first
roper looks over at the other bank employees huddled on the floor
whos the manager
a balding middle aged man sheepishly raises his hand
roper takes a step toward him
when did you start keeping longer hours
because ive been thinking of moving to this branch
it would be really convenient for me earl wags his gun against the tellers ear
do you want me to start killing people
roper holds his hand up defensively
its my job to see that no one gets killed earl
then wheres my fucking car
earl is pouring sweat
his gun hand is shaking uncontrollably
im getting it earl but we have to do this the right way
roper keeps his eyes locked on earl
his voice is calm
first i need you to point that gun away from to the teller whats your name
voice trembling debbie
point the gun away from debbie
debbies brains are going to be splattered all over the floor if i dont see a car in five minutes
roper takes a long look at earl
the guy is a hair trigger
but lets be clear about one thing
if you kill someone i cant help you
the swat guys will take you out
earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside
reflects for a moment on the reality of the situation
what are my chances of getting out of here
roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying
last month a guy robbed a bank in daly city
roper crouches down smiles at the blurry eyed guard
how ya doin
the guard groans
hes not doing very well
roper peels back the bloody handkerchief takes a look
to earl cops gave him a car and he lost them on the freeway
earl is encouraged by that
bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals
roper looks directly into earls eyes
he didnt kill anybody though
roper bends over the guard
this is gonna hurt
he grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him across the floor
the guard moans piteously
hey leave him alone
what are you doing
roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door
its part of my negotiators oath
if theres an injured party and i can help them im duty bound by my oath to do that
you can shoot me if you want but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing
earl is unsure what to do but he guesses an oath is an oath
he lets roper drag the guard to the door
ill be right back earl
point that gun away from debbie
earl compliantly moves the gun away from the tellers head then re thinks and jerks it back against her temple
roper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on the sidewalk
two swat officers rush up to give aid
one of them is jennings
whispering to jennings give me your gun
note the method of disarming earl is still to be determined jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to him
roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband under his shirt and vest
i havent had to shoot anyone in three years
why not keep the streak alive
because this strung out junkie is too stupid to get out of this without killing somebody
earl watches roper through the window
he can only see ropers back
hes getting very agitated
yelling the two cops hustle off with the wounded guard and roper calmly walks back into the bank
stops about five paces from earl
as a rule i need one hostage released as show of good faith
roper glances at debbie
gun pressed against her head
tears start rolling down her cheeks
shes being tremendously brave
give me debbie
earl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her head
take the old guy
the other hostages watch this exchange tensely
the old guy
what kind of show of faith is that
i want debbie
am i gettin the car
youre gettin the car
earl thinks about it his gun hand twitching
he points at two of the female employees cowering against the counter
roper decides that this is the best hes going to get
you two leave
the two women dont need any extra encouragement
they jump up and rush out the front door
mccall and forbes watch through their rifle scopes as the two released hostages are whisked away by uniformed cops
this guy is good
thats what they say
that was fine earl
now im going to get your car
roper turns around and walks toward the front door
he stops and looks over his shoulder
oh theres one last thing
earl looks like hes right on the edge
you want a convertible or hardtop
earl thinks about that for a beat
roper turns around starts walking again
he keeps his eyes focused on the reflection of earl in the front window of the bank
without turning around manual or automatic
you got it
in one swift motion roper turns aims and fires
it tears into earls shoulder
one inch from debbies neck
earl is blown back against the counter
debbie shrieks at the top of her lungs
swat guys pour in from every entrance
yelling for everybody to get down
they pounce on earl
i give up
i give up
roper goes to debbie puts his arm around her and gently leads her out of the bank
mccall and forbes still have their rifles trained on the bank door
their police radio squawks
the situation is secured
suspect in custody
mccall lowers his rifle as roper guides debbie through the wave of cops rushing into the bank
roper is exiting the bank and putting back on his gun when he hears the sound of a camera shutter
he turns to see veronica ronnie tate holding the camera
she snaps one of roper with earl in the b
being placed in a squad car
theres one for the front page
roper puts his hand over his heart as if stricken with love
which he in fact is
ronnie why are you torturing me
i cant live without you
ronnie rolls her eyes
she doesnt take roper all that seriously
she slings the camera over her shoulder and starts to walk off
roper dogs her
this baseball player youre going out with
shaking his head hes no good for you
hes a wonderful guy
he makes two million a year and he worships me
i worship you
you worship yourself
ronnie forget this whats his name
did you know hes already got a bad knee
in another years youre going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair
looks him in the eye
you know what i think
i think you only want me now because im with somebody else
who cares what you think
i want you back and thats all that matters
ronnie smiles but offers no response
let me take you out tomorrow night
im going out with greg tomorrow
frowning this greg is really getting in my way
roper gets down on his knees
im begging you
oh ive got to get a shot of this
she takes the lense cap off her camera
roper primps his hair to make sure he looks good for the picture
suddenly roper notices that his trans am is being towed
he rushes over to his car
hey thats my car
a repo man stands off to the side watching dispassionately
now it belongs to silver hills financial
roper sadly watches the tow truck drive off with his beloved trans am
lots of activity
officers in cubicles talking on phones typing reports on computers
most are plain clothed
roper weaves through the room
passes by bafferts desk
hey baffert whats the story for tonight
baffert pulls two tickets for the warriors game out of his pocket
youre my hero
dinners on you
a quiet contrast to the squadroom
this is the executive branch of metro
all the big wigs are officed here
roper walks down the carpeted hall
no one here except kevin mccall quietly sitting outside captain solis office
roper and mccall make brief eye contact
roper thinks nothing of it
he goes into the captains office
captain frank solis is on the phone
theres a file on the desk in front of him
he motions roper to sit down
he just walked into my office
looks over at roper the chief says good work this morning
roper smiles as he sits down
tell him to give me a raise
into the phone he says thank you very much
a beat ill discuss it with him right now
good bye chief
solis hangs up
looks across the desk at roper
a long pause
he knows hes got leverage
are you going to make this hard for me
theres been some concern about you continuing to work without back up
solis dumps his cards on the table
what if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it
your concern is heartwarming
its been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you
is that what the guy in the sunday school suit is doing outside
his names kevin mccall
every metro captain agrees that hes their top sharp shooter and most likely to succeed
roper grabs mccalls folder off the desk
let me see that
roper scans it
tested high on his intellectual aptitude
not as high as me but
national marksman finalist
went to college
mccall turns around in his chair
he can see roper and solis through the glass walls of the office but he cant hear their voices
additional skills biathelete marathoner lip reading speaks spanish
roper throws the folder back on the desk
great send him to the marines
this guys not a negotiator
hell quit in two weeks
you let us worry about that
is there going to be an expression of your appreciation
gloomily what kind of appreciation are we talking about
the financial kind
i figure im going to be working extra hours
all sorts of overtime
not to mention the extra stress
what do you think would be in order
i dont know
boldly five thousand dollars
calmly okay i think i could swing that
uh oh roper thinks maybe he sold short
quickly and a car
hey you just got a five thousand dollar raise
get a car of your own
you know youve got nothing but cars down there in impound
impound isnt a rent a car company
firmly the car is part of the deal
what happened to your trans am
solis gets up and taps the glass motions for mccall to come in
repoed this morning
relenting ill provide you with transportation
and even if this doesnt work i want all the money
these swat guys dont have the temperament
they dont have the background
mccall enters the office
instant character change hey glad to meet you
ive heard nothing but good things about you
roper reaches out
they shake hands
ive watched you in action
youve got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator
im ready to do it
a beat and im going to be here more than two weeks
ropers face darkens
dont go reading my lips man
thats an intrusion
save that shit for the sniper school
intervening lets move past this gentlemen
were already past it arent we kevin
if you say so
then youll have to excuse me
i have other work to do
roper and mccall head out the door
roper turns back around
about the transportation issue
you check with the impound sergeant
moving with roper and mccall
you ever been in a hostage situation
only at the very end
how do you feel after a shooting
self assured like it had to be done
they enter the squadroom wind through the cubicles
it rarely has to be done
ive rarely shot anyone
swat is a lifesaving unit you know
flatly i know
try to remember that
they arrive at ropers desk
okay dead eye lesson one
roper grabs an empty soda bottle from a neighboring desk
he takes the cap off a ball point pen and drops it into the empty bottle
he places the bottle on his desk
extract that pen cap without touching or moving the bottle
mccall looks at the bottle quizzically
whats the point of this
a little exercise in lateral thinking
the obvious solution isnt always the only solution
see you tomorrow
roper grabs his jacket and walks off leaving mccall to ponder the problem
mccall looks over at another cop who has been observing
the cop shrugs his shoulders
he hasnt got a clue
mccall sits down and thoughtfully peers into the bottle
sequence omitted from original script
roper and baffert walking past the row of cars including solis cadillac searching for ropers new transportation
roper is holding the keys in his hand
mind if we make a stop on the way
we busted frank antonucci on possession
he gave us a lead on that polk street jewelry heist
dont waste your time
hed tell you his granny was in on the kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar
i still gotta do it
wasting time is half my job
roper is looking at the numbered parking spaces
this swat guy might be a good idea
he may be able to take a little pressure off you
i worry about you
you worried about me too
the chiefs worried about me
solis is worried about me
maybe you guys should start some kind of organization
speaking of which
i saw you talking to ronnie this morning
why cant you get it back together with her
youve gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one
its not me
shes going out with this baseball player greg barnett
impressed no shit
he swings at anything in the dirt
i could strike him out
dont give up on her
youre getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things
roper bends over like an old man
yep my rheumatisms been acting up
they arrive at their destination
a parking space with a this is it
roper looks at the pickup truck in disbelief
then he didnt say
he must have said or something because this cant be right
baffert unlocks the pickup and offers the keys to roper who is crossing to the truck
what am i red foxx
im not riding in this shit
i cant roll in no shit like this
he takes the keys from baffert who moves around to the passengers side
he opens the door
wheres the stereo
fuck the stereo
whats that smell
just get in
we gotta go
the pickup in traffic
sequence omitted from original script
its a four story twenties style walk up
its evening now
the pickup pulls to a stop out front
baffert pulls out a slip of paper
you want me to go up with you
nah it probably wont turn up anything
im just gonna talk to him
i dont want to be late
baffert gets out
roper grabs his cell phone
you want anything on the game
baffert turns back around
whats the line
it was warriors plus this morning
ill take half of your action
baffert goes into the building
roper dials his cellular phone
a message on the display reads recharge battery
roper looks around
theres a payphone across the street
he gets out of the truck and crosses to it
third floor hallway
nice middle class place
well kept up
baffert walks over to room
jazz is playing
michael korda sits motionless in a chair listening to the music
theres a knock
korda responds as if pulled from a trance
he rises and moves to the door
who is it
its lieutenant sam baffert from the san francisco police department
a slight hesitation from korda
he glances around the apartment
for what reason we dont know
maybe to make sure theres nothing incriminating around
he opens the door
is there a problem
may i come in
i would just like to ask you a couple of questions
korda steps aside and lets baffert enter
korda closes the door
baffert scans the place
he listens to the music
a smile grows on his face
korda smiles back
another jazz aficionada
things aint what they used to be recorded july
now i can hear it
korda goes to the stereo turns it down
duke ellington plays low
where did you find an old recording like that
used record shop down on turk street
i was in there looking for some robert johnson
searching for the name memories
memory lane or something
ive got to stop in there
korda do you know frank antonucci
you mean frank who owns the bakery down the street
no this is a different frank
this is a man who deals in jewelry
stolen jewelry usually
you wouldnt know anybody like that
korda drifts to the other side of the room
takes a look out his front window
just the truck
i certainly wouldnt
he says it as if the very idea disturbs him
he turns away from the window
baffert feigns a coughing spell
could i please have a little water
the perfect host of course
korda heads toward the kitchen area
baffert uses this as an opportunity to drift around the room
do a little snooping
the reason im asking you is because we arrested him with some stolen jewelry
it was traced to the robbery of a store down on polk street
he said he was fencing it for you
baffert notices something in the trash can
several glassine envelopes used for raw jewels
they have jewelers markings on them indicating gem weight and grade
korda pouring the water notices bafferts discovery but his face betrays nothing
calmly theres obviously some mistake
i have a cousin who has had run ins with the law
korda re enters the room with the glass of water
perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this
this cousin of yours
whats his name
forthrightly clarence teal
they look at each other a beat
korda is still holding the water
your cough seems to be better
a real repressed tension here
someones about to get hurt
baffert takes the glass of water
he takes a sip
korda watches him like a cobra
baffert puts the glass down on the table
well im on my way to the game
i appreciate your cooperation mr
baffert walks to the door
opens it to leave
baffert turns back around
do you believe that story about robert johnson
that he made a deal with the devil at the crossroads
baffert muses along with korda
baffert moves off down the hall and korda closes his door
baffert gets into the elevator
baffert takes out his cell phone
as the elevator descends hello judge stone
this is lieutenant samuel baffert
im at a suspects residence
im requesting a telephonic search warrant in connection with an armed robbery at a jewelry store
theres visible evidence on the premises
glassine envelopes with jewelers markings were seen in the trash can
the elevator hits the first floor
i believe a full search of the premises will turn up some stolen property
the elevator opens
korda is standing there with a knife
baffert has no time to react
the knife hand slashes forward
stabbing the chest and slashing across the throat
korda calmly exits the building as roper crosses the street returning from the payphone
neither of the men take any particular notices of each other
a woman carrying her groceries enters the building
roper gets to the truck
a scream from inside the building
baffert is laying in the open elevator knife wounds to his neck and chest
roper rushes over to him
it doesnt look good
the woman with the groceries is standing halfway up the first flight of stairs
roper pulls out his gun and rushes by her up the stairs
to the woman get an ambulance
roper arrives at the top of the stairs
kordas door is ajar
duke ellington can be heard faintly
roper nudges the door open takes a step inside gun ready
no one there
suddenly from the hallway the click of a door
roper races out
roper sprints to the door at the end of the hall kicks it open
a five year old stares up at him
roper holds up a reassuring hand and as quickly as he arrived he leaves
roper burst out the front
down the stairs to the sidewalk
looks both ways down the street
realizes in dismay that korda is long gone
a siren approaches
angle outside window to roper sitting in a chair by the window looking out to the rain
solis is in the b
on the phone
on the phone yes sir
every resource will be brought to bear
we will find this guy
yeah hes here now
ill tell him
solis hangs up the phone
the chief says to tell you how sorry he is
he knew sam baffert was a good man
still looking out window he said he was just going up to talk to him
beat turning to solis i want to be put on this case
i cant do that
emphatic i want to be put on this case
you know i cant assign you to this
youre much too close to it
you were much too close to sam
the department will take care of it
whos running it
whos running it
kimura and glass will head the investigation
roper turns to leave
get some sleep
roper pauses at the door
then pulls out two basketball tickets and lays them on the table in solis office
a female named kimura and a tall guy named glass try to make a getaway as they see roper coming
hey hey hey
roper intercepts them
anything on korda so far
solis said to keep you clear of this
roper responds louder than necessary with a half turn toward solis hallway
i dont give a damn what solis said
to the detectives if you get a lead i want to know
sequence omitted from original script
ropers pickup drives by
thru the windshield
we see roper as the windshield wipers flap back and forth
his face seems dazed and lost
ronnies cheerful voice can be heard
just a minute
roper makes no effort to pull himself together
the door opens and ronnies face registers surprise
shes dressed casually in jeans a nice shirt but wears make up and earrings
came by to see troy
like hell a little late for that scottie
smells his breath jack daniels
im not drunk
maybe you should be
she nods sympathetic but doesnt leave the doorway
can i come in
ronnie opens the door reluctantly
instantly we see hes at home here
he hangs his coat in the closet puts his keys on the table notices a photograph on the wall
very unique style
that a new picture
about months old
im working in a new style
roper gazes at it indifferently
he falls silent
thoughts turned inward
suddenly troy the dog bounds in
hes ecstatic to see roper
he puts his front paws on the couch and his head in ropers lap
how ya doin boy
to ronnie he heard my voice
roper smiles briefly pats the dog taking comfort from his presence
his words are light
his tone isnt
hows the good dog
i miss you buddy
you miss me
ronnie watches them suddenly showing the sadness shes carefully buried
he misses me
a moments silence
i wont stay long
i had to talk to someone
a bit surprised at his openness you dont usually talk to anyone when youre hurting
it was my fault
i was right downstairs
i should have gone up with him
scott you cant save everyone
ive proved that didnt i
shes not coming closer
she wants to but she wont do it
she seems uneasy glances towards the door
oh hell forget it
this wont work
gentle what do you want from me
something i guess i cant have anymore
dont try to make me feel guilty
the whole time we were together you went out of your way to prove you didnt need me
now suddenly for one night you need me again
i cant do it
i cant be more than your friend
because i know what will happen
in a few weeks youll be back on top and youll shut me out just as soon as you dont need me again
surprised hurt you think i didnt need you
if you did you never showed it
he reaches for her and she looks like she might give in to him but at that moment theres a knock on the door
ronnie pulls back confused and guilty
you expecting someone
her silence is the answer
a flash of pain from roper
this day just keeps getting better
ronnie watches as he searches for his keys in his pockets
soft theyre on the table where you always leave them
he grabs the keys as she opens the door
greg stands outside waiting
hes a big good looking guy with a smile on his face
hey baby i thought maybe you were
gregs smile fades as he sees roper
i was just leaving
roper strides past greg who remains in the doorway
ronnie makes brief eye contact with greg but then moves past him to follow roper
she calls after him
take care of yourself
roper doesnt look back
he just goes
a huge warehouse
sun coming up over the east bay clarence teal rides up on a harley motorcyle carrying a large cup of coffee to go
he enters the warehouse
car and boat parts stacked in aisles ten feet high
clarence shuffles through to his watchmans quarters which are connected to the end of the warehouse
built on pilings with a panoramic view of the bay
korda is waiting behind the door as clarence enters
he seizes clarence from behind and slams him against the wall and spins him around
hot coffee soaks the front of clarences shirt
if you werent family id kill you
clarence is scared
he offers no defense
you told antonucci that shit came from me
so that we could get the best price
hes got respect for you
hes gonna try to lowball me mike
korda tosses clarence down onto the cot
you fucking idiot
why do you think i use you
to be a walking advertisement
im sorry mike
i never heard of lamarra flipping on anyone before
he said he had the cops paid off
antonucci never flipped on anyone before
he had the cops paid off
not the fucking cop that showed up at my door
what happened mike
you dont want to know
tears start to come to clarences eyes
im sorry mike
clarence sincerely feels bad
its kind of touching in a twisted way
korda moves over to the window to keep from striking clarence again
he looks off across the bay
god damn it
i still needed to case that fucking store
its too risky to show my face now
i got a couple thousand bucks
you could leave town
theyre going to know me in fucking des moines now
a beat they got over ten million in jewels in that place
thats freedom man
i could go anywhere i want
clarence watches korda warily
things are beginning to add up in his head
did you kill him mike
korda turns to clarence with a penetrated stare that answers the question
clarence is shaken by that
he starts to whimper again
im sorry mike
im really sorry
were talking major fear here
korda moves to him and we think hes going to bash him around again but surprisingly he hugs clarences head against his chest
its not your fault youre stupid
tears of relief from clarence
roper enters the squadroom
his mood is contained
he walks to a desk where kimura and glass are huddling
a couple desks over mccall is reclining in ropers chair reading a book entitled strategies and counter measures in hostage situations
on the desk in front of him is the bottle with the pen cap still in it
to kimura and glass what do you got on korda
we ran a search on relatives
he has a cousin in town clarence teal
last known address was on pine street
he moved out a month ago
weve got a couple leads on him to check out
rapid fire did you check out dmv for any vehicles registration
being faxed over now
how about the record room for any incident reports
he might be a victim
we can get medical records
check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him knows his habits
and what about bars
we can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents
roper were into it
suddenly solis appears at their side
weve had this conversation once roper
youre not active on this case
roper looks at him icily
its in everyones best interest
mccall kimura glass all watch this confrontation tensely
after a beat roper gives in
indicates his compliance
solis heads back to this office
softened you guys are doing good work
he moves toward the desk
mccall gets up when he sees him coming
im sorry about your friend
i had a friend in swat killed
i know how it can be
i appreciate your concern
lets leave it at that
mccall respectfully drops it
roper looks down at the soda bottle
i dont see much progress here
mccall holds up a finger
not so fast
he picks up a pot from a nearby mr
its filled with water
he takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle
the pen cap floats to the top and mccall plucks it out without touching or moving the bottle
you get an a
no force required
just then a sergeant calls to roper across the squadroom
roper domestic disturbance at th street
possible hostage situation
mccall grabs his duffel bag
roper starts away from the desk then notices the book on hostage strategies
he looks at the title then makes a demonstration of dropping it in the trash can
he and mccall head out
the pickup is weaving through traffic
start on one of those air freshener evergreen trees hanging from the rear view mirror
pull back to show a police bubble flashing on the dashboard
roper weaving through traffic
mccall is sitting calmly as ever
so mccall how come you ended up in san francisco
they recruited me
promised me fast advancement
recruited you from where
national marksman competition
with your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers
furthest point i could find from new york
you dont like new york
spent my whole life there
i just wanted to get out for a while
youd never been out of new york
been to toronto
my mother was born there
how did you like toronto
it was okay
youre a real excitable sort arent you
you caught me on an up day
a beat how about you
how did you end up in san francisco
i grew up in oakland
crossed the bay bridge and here i was
a beat so youre looking for fast advancement
is there something wrong with that
im not sure
several patrol cars are parked in front of an unappealing apartment building
a crowd has begun to gather
uniformed policemen hold them back
two cops are questioning a man wearing only green slacks
just the slacks
he is very agitated
the pickup screeches up
roper and mccall hop out
roper flashes his badge to the officer in charge
give me the short version
husband came home
found that guy and his wife in flagrante
now hes holding her at knife point
the officer points up to the third floor
that one with the bars on the windows
walks back over to the pickup
eyeballs the building
how are we gonna get him out of there
we could fill it with water
roper throws him a look
mccall walks to the back of the pickup reaches into the cab and digs around in his duffel bag
to officer have you evacuated anyone
only that floor
is the hostage injured
she keeps screaming to stay out
he keeps screaming to stay out
we decided to stay out
well theres a good amount of agreement on that
mccall slams the truck door sniper rifle in hand
ill take highground until swat gets here
surveying the area i can get a good sight line from that roof across the street
mccall marches off across the street
remember quick draw were trying to limit the force here
mccall calls back over his shoulder
i know my job
at that moment a scream echoes down from the third floor window
roper heads for the front door of the building
mccall bounds up the stairs of the building to the rooftop
the screams are getting more panicky
roper comes down the hall quickly
the door to the apartment is open
its been that way since the guy in the green slacks fled
roper hurries toward the door
the wife is in bra and panties and the husband is
hes giving her a good beating
its a studio apartment
belongings strewn all over
window open with sun streaming in and a good view of the building across the street
we hear ropers voice from out in the hall
im coming in
im not armed
the husband snatches his wife by the hair and holds a knife to her throat
shrieking no raymond
to roper stay the fuck out of here
but roper steps into the apartment
sees the wife
knife to her neck
the enraged husband contemplating murder
one inch from committing the act
roper doesnt bat an eye
i know how you feel ray
you dont know shit and i suggest you leave
he presses the knife against the wifes throat
her chest heaves
i cant leave ray
its part of my negotiators oath
once im in the room with the hostage i have to stay
you dont want to see what im going to do to her
let me show you something ray
roper reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wallet
he extracts a photo
a little dog eared
holds it up so raymond can see it
same thing happened to me man
she cheated on me but i forgave her
you know why
i aint interested in your life story
because i was partially to blame
i wasnt around as much as i should have been
i forgot how to love her
shes the one to blame
in prone position
rifle in hand
eye to scope
of raymonds open window
everyone where we left them
roper looks at ray with utter sincerity
ray think about how she looked when you married her
think about how happy you were
dont lose that man
dont give up everything
what am i giving up
im laid off last year
im down to my last unemployment check
im out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed
and now ray is crying
and hes not that coherent

west centrals running things now
its out of our hands fuck them
deep sigh im gonna kill her and then im gonna kill myself cause i dont wanna live anymore
roper reaches out to him
ray if you walk out of here with me ill get you a job
i cant guarantee you what it will be
but i swear on my life ill find you work
and why the fuck would you do that for me
not for you ray
a close friend of mine was killed this week
the way i figure it i stop you from doin what you said im one up on body count
who the fuck are you mother teresa
my names scott roper
ray stares blankly at ropers outstretched hand the knife clutched tightly in his fist
the wife squeezes her eyes closed
everything waits for an excruciatingly long beat
i need my coat
its on a coat rack in the corner
but to get there he has to pass by the window
ray drops his wife on the bed turns and goes to get his coat
he crosses in front of the window
reaches for the coat
a bullet slams into his skull
ray falls to the floor
the wife runs out of the room screaming
he rushes over to ray
circle of blood soaking into the carpet
rays empty eyes
his hand still wrapped in his coat
he was dead instantly
roper slams his fist into the wall
a couple of cops guns drawn arrive at the doorway
roper bolts out of the room
pounds down the hallway
pounds down the stairs
down another flight
mccall comes across the street
roper sees mccall cool as ever
rifle slung over his shoulder
roper steps into his path
mccall gives no answer
he pushes past roper and continues into the building
roper follows screaming his head off
do you think because the police department issued you a sniper rifle it makes you god
what the fuck goes on in your head
mccall still stone faced reaches the apartment
yellow crime scene tape is being placed across the doorway
cops are tiptoeing around surveying evidence
mccall ducks under the tape
mccall goes over to rays body
roper comes up behind him
mccall picks up the coat covering rays arms
clutched in rays hand is a gun saturday night special variety
mccall looks up at roper
swat is a lifesaving unit remember
i just saved a life
roper doesnt miss a beat
still angry you think ive never had a gun pulled on me
you think every fucking time someone pulls a gun they use it
mccall gets to his feet
eighty five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder suicide
fiercely not the ones im at
mccall and roper glare at each other
toe to toe
mccalls face softens just perceptibly
he walks out of the room
roper whips the sheet off the bed contemplates the gun gripped in rays hand
then tosses the sheet over rays dead body
roper seated in the hallway waiting outside a door marked internal affairs
things are quiet
roper stares at the floor
the door opens
mccall comes out escorted by two internal affairs investigators
one of the investigators pats him on the back
looks like a clean shoot
go home and get some rest
mccall shakes hands with the investigators and they disappear back into the office
roper approaches mccall
hes cooled off considerably
even a tad friendly
lets go for a drink
i dont really like to drink
you have to
its a tradition
well if i have to i have to
a neighborhood bar
roper and mccall are playing pool
half finished beers are on a nearby table
mccall is bent over the table trying to make a particularly tricky shot
roper studies him
you got a girlfriend
you like my ass
mccall misses the shot
better than your pool game
roper lines up his shot
you wouldnt want to put a small wager on this would you
i dont gamble
sinks his shot
moves around the table
yeah ive got a girlfriend
you living together
shes back in jersey
going to graduate school
explain how that works
shes going to come here when she graduates and then were gonna get married
she grow up in livingtston too
as if that were unthinkable no no no
a beat shes from hoboken
oh city girl
dont you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in new jersey
we see each other every couple of months
every couple of months huh
a couple of months sounds like an awful long time to roper
thats a lot of commitment
i admire that
do you really
actually i think its fucking crazy i dont know if i could do it
thanks for clearing that up
a beat i hear your former girlfriend is going out with greg barnett
where did you hear that
barnetts tough competition
yeah well thats a sore subject and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage
a beat and then mccall realizes that this comment is a major acknowledgement of acceptance from roper
roper misses his shot
picks up his beer glass
lesson two dead eye
should have been lesson one
never exchange yourself for a hostage
i think i can handle that one
yeah you think so but it comes up
roper takes a drink of beer
nears the bottom of his glass
calls to the bartender
zack another round
roper turns back to mccall
my partner gave himself in exchange for a ten year old girl
he got caught in the crossfire
my partner and the bad guy
takes the last sip weird thing is if he was alive hed probably do it again
a beat some people never learn
roper puts down his glass
you think you can learn mccall
i think so
maybe he can
were looking at a door
its not clear where we are
we only see his face
im officer mccall whats going on
its a training room
its built to approximate a convenience store
several mannequins are placed around the room to represent a hostage situation
the bad guy has a walkie talkie strapped around his neck
ropers voice crackles out of it
what the fuck do you think is going on turdhead
im about to waste everyone in this place
mccall hesitates trying to figure out a response
he seems stiff and awkward
how can i help you
tell me what
looks off to his right i feel stupid talking to a dummy
roper enters the training room from a side door
hes holding the other walkie talkie
what did you think
im going to let you practice on real people
roper comes up beside him
first things is dont say whats going on
everybody knows whats going on
i come into this situation i say addressing the mannequin im glad to see nobodys hurt
im here to help you
turns back to mccall second you hesitated
if youre thinking talk while youre thinking or else hes going to think youre plotting
which you are
if he thinks youre plotting youre going to make him nervous
you dont want him nervous
angle on the door
mccall comes in
the room has the same set up
mccall takes a look around
launches immediately into
my names mccall
im a hostage negotiator
im here to help you
ropers voice crackles back at him hostilely
how are you going to help me
mccalls confidence is growing
tell me what you need
i need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so i can cut off his nuts
now hes stumped
hesitantly i cant do that
then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit
mccall looks up to his right
is all the name calling necessary
roper re enters the training area
nah i just throw that in because i enjoy it
exasperated so what do i say to this guy
you could say something like addressing the dummy tell me what the scumbags name is
maybe we can work something out
bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off
roper turns to mccall
if you want to be a successful negotiator youve got to learn to lie
im not good at lying
get good at it
its against my nature
roper gives him an amused smile
you know the ten commandments
whats the first commandment
thou shall have no other god before me
thats not the answer roper wanted
okay forget that
whats the main one
mccall is tired of guessing
you tell me
thou shall not kill
youve killed right
to save lives
so why would you hesitate to lie to save lives
mccall cant argue with that one
roper turns and heads back to the side door
lets try it again
mccall comes through the door
hands in the air
the setup in the room has been changed a bit
the bad guy is behind the counter
several hostages in various positions on the floor
my names mccall
roper comes through the side door
close your eyes
mccall is surprised by the command but closes them
roper turns him away from the hostage scene
what did you see
rapid fire a dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed off
a berretta nine millimeter in his belt
a female hostage red dress on the floor in front of the cereal display
male hostage jeans and blue checked shirt three feet to her right
another male hostage white pants green shirt nikes laying in front of the magazine rack
a female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt sitting against the beer cooler trying to pass herself off as a hostage and theres a special on toilet paper four
for a buck twenty nine
mccall opens his eyes
youve got good eyes
roper and mccall are sitting in the dark watching a video tape
its grainy footage of a hostage situation in a sporting goods store
a negotiator confronted with a gunman holding a ten year old girl hostage
the negotiator holds his hands out imploringly
carefully moves toward the gunman
the negotiator exchanges himself for the little girl
the gunman grabs the negotiator around the neck holds the gun to his head
the little girl runs out of the picture to safety
roper remains dead silent during all this
mccall looks over at him
the blue light flickers over ropers motionless face
was that your partner
why did he do it
quietly because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better
we had a plan but swat opened up too early
he got caught in the crossfire
a sad beat lets move on
always use the eyes to keep the connection
it almost like hypnosis
thats the most important thing
create a connection
youre always on their side
mccall watches him for a beat then turns his attention back on the screen
roper and mccall leaning against the rail at the walking ring
the horses are being paraded and saddled
roper scrutinizes them with an expert eye
mccall seems totally disinterested
you know why i like the track
youre a compulsive gambler
roper ignores that
because there are a multitude of possibilitys
everything is there to see if you know what to look for
you have to read the conditions just like in a hostage situation
roper points across the ring to a particular horse
see the four horse
dropping in class
looks like hes broken down
but notice the woman in the sun hat
shes the owner
she wouldnt have come if her horse was broken down
we use him
mccall listens indifferently
see the favorite
he doesnt want to run today
cross him off
now the six looks good
on his toes
this trainer jockey combo does well
we cant leave him out
turns to mccall what do you think
i have two words for you
i have three words for you
ex ac ta
roper is buying tickets
mccall is with him watching the other bettors the odds board all the monitors
roper finishes and turns away from the window
hands mccall a ticket
i bought you a four six exacta box
you owe me twenty bucks
puzzled i do
roper and mccall pass by a gambler
how you doin marv
they sit down in a box right up front
we need the and to finish to first and second
no enthusiasm fine
roper uses his binoculars to watch the horses warm up on the backstretch
im told that newspaper photographer is your former girlfriend
roper looks over at him
whats this about
now shes going out with greg barnett
so what do you want
i dont know why shed pick him over you
roper throws mccall a skeptical look
straight faced im just practicing my lying
still needs work
downcast youre right
ill never be as good a liar as you
and theyre racing
the horses spring from the gate
the track announcers call plays through race roper watches intently through the binoculars
mccall sits impassively
okay were in good shape
were in good shape
mccall looks across the track
the horse is last
thats his style
to run last
to run late
roper follows the horses into the turn
the favorites fading
i told you he wasnt going to run today
the four horse has got the lead
mccall sits like a wax figure
cynically the horse is still last
hell be running at the quarter pole
the horses head into the stretch
the four is on the lead and the six is starting to unleash a big run
passing horses with every stride
there he goes
mccall sits forward slightly
they need to run first and second
yeah first and second
roper gets to his feet
the horses thunder down the stretch
the four horse is in front and the six is coming on from behind
roper is on his feet screaming
come on russell
come on russell
mccall jumps to this feet and joins him
to roper who the fucks russell
roper and mccall cheer together
the four horse crosses the finish line in front
the six horse is flying
needs to beat one horse to be second
hes running out of room
with one last surge he hits the wire and
its too close to call
mccall really excited turns to roper
disheartened we lost
confidently we won
how much you wanna bet
you want to bet on whether you won your bet
this is getting sick
as the photo finish light goes out and the numbers come on
thats eight hundred bucks
roper and mccall collect their money
four hundred a piece not bad
mccall pockets his money
how long you been coming here
about six years
my partner took me
is it always like this
occasionally you lose
suddenly ropers beeper goes off
he checks it takes out a cellular phone and dials
into the phone roper here
he listens im on my way
he hangs up and turns to mccall
we gotta go
tastefully reinforced windows and door
choppers circle overhead
both ends of the street are sealed off
barricades are up
spectators and news crews crowd behind those
numerous police circulate
this is a major operation in full swing
its across the street from the jewelry store
the walls are plastered with travel posters
a poster of tahiti is the most prominent
members of police and swat are standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on a table
right behind them is a tv monitoring the front of the store
solis is at another desk on the phone
hes talking to the suspect
were working on that joe
these things arent quite that simple
roper and mccall push through the barricades and come walking down the cordoned off street
mccall takes a look at the jewelry store
well fortified foreboding
this does not look good
roper looks over there gives no reaction
they reach solis convertible cadillac
its parked out front of the travel agency building
solis has me driving the shit mobile and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand
probably worth thirty
roper and mccall enter
mccall joins the men who are studying the blueprint
roper stands by solis and listens takes note of the poster of tahiti
this will take time to setup
ill have to get authorizations
he listens okay you relax and ill solis pulls the phone away from his ear
joe has obviously hung up
what do we got
minutes ago the silent alarm went off then the fire alarm
a unit was a block away and the suspect got trapped inside
any verification on numbers
weve only seen and talked to one suspect
he calls himself joe
theres two jewelers two salespeople the manager a security guard and an elderly woman
this particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair
they have anywhere from to million in raw stones on any given day so they sure as shit didnt just wander in
they knew what they were coming for
what have you promised them
just that id talk to my superiors
mccall returns from checking out the blueprints
any good points of entry
mccall shakes his head
the place is designed to be a vault
roper picks up the cellular phone
it dials automatically
into the phone my names roper
how are you people doing in there
he listens solis is off the job now joe
im the guy authorized to give you whatever you want
listens thats right but first i need to come down there to talk to you
we dont see anything but the suspect on the other end of the phone
hes wearing a ski mask and gloves
totally unrecognizable to the audience
we will find out soon that he is in fact korda
he appears very cool and collected
you dont have to come here
yes i do
that way theres no misunderstandings
i need to make sure no ones hurt then we can take care of business
a long pause
then a bit sinister
you want to come
i wont be armed
we gotta operate on trust here
were going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible
roper clicks off the phone
he already doesnt like the sound of this guy
roper bulletproof vest hands in the air walks across the eerily deserted street straight toward the jewelry store
its quiet now
the choppers have been pulled back
roper reaches the sidewalk right in front of the store
korda cracks the door open
warningly stay there
roper stops in his tracks
im going to put my hands down okay
roper slowly lowers his hands
everybody watching through the window
korda takes a half step out the doorway
the gloved hand that is visible is not holding a weapon
the other half of his body is hidden inside the doorway
he wears jeans a black shirt and black nike tennis shoes
he stares fiercely from behind the ski mask
theres no sign of fear in him
are you in charge roper
i want a car
like a four wheel drive
i want it in perfect condition
i want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here
i want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street
then well come out
i dont want any remote control devices in it
i know all the tricks
if its not in perfect condition and i mean if its even low on wiper fluid im going to kill somebody and were gonna start again
korda lets that sink in
i want a plane waiting at the airport
ill tell them where i want to go when i get there
is that all
for now thats all
youll get it
but joe i want you to do something for me
let me take a look around inside
make sure everybodys okay
you just do shit for me right now
kordas eyes glare from behind the ski mask
hes an ominous figure
joe im doing a lot for you
i think you could give me something to cement the deal
ill give you something
korda pulls a wadded up handkerchief out of his pocket and tosses it to roper
roper unwraps the handkerchief
its a human ear
in fifteen minutes itll be a bigger piece
i assume there are no misunderstanding
roper is as serious as weve ever seen him
i understand you completely
korda disappears back behind the door
roper trudges back in
things are more active now
logistical officers are making flow charts
photos of the hostages are being posted on a bulletin board
roper approaches solis mccall and the swat captain who are anxiously waiting for his report
flatly were going to have to take this guy out
that draws a long silence
thats something roper rarely says
cant we wear him down
roper hands solis the handkerchief with the ear in it
solis eyes it with dismay
i believe theres at least one fatality in there already
the fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire
i believe hes working alone both from his conversation and the fact that he wouldnt come out beyond the doorway
he was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me
his demeanor is calm and controlled thats what really scares me
the other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with our techniques
a beat so do you want to go in or wait for him to come out
mccall calmly offers his opinion
let him come out
too many unknowns in there
thatll be the plan
when we drive up the car make sure its at an angle about three feet from the curb
to swat captain put our best man highground twenty degree down angle
the swat captain motions and turns to one of his underlings
have anderson prep it and notify us when hes on line
the underling hurries off to take care of it
solis looks at roper dejectedly
i feel this thing going sideways on us
roper tries to buck him up
there is some good news
hes wearing a ski mask so hes protecting his identity and hasnt determined to kill all the hostages
big pause yet
the jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is korda
his face is sweaty
angle widens to show five very scared hostages a jeweler middle aged balding
the male manager good looking thirties three piece suit
two salesgirls nicely dressed late twenties
a female customer gray haired hillsborough matron
they are all seated against the wall
there are two fatalities lying on the floor
the guard and one of the jewelers
korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler and motions to the dead bodies
drag them behind the counter
the two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the grim task
the two salesgirls watch korda fearfully
the older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of reality
her eyes are a bit far away
korda moves over to the remaining display cases that havent been looted
with the barrel of his gun he smashes the glass reaches in and picks out the jewelry
he dumps it in an open satchel already half filled with packets of raw gemstones and gold chains
suddenly the older woman customer gets to her feet
she seems fairly out of it
maybe in shock
she starts walking toward the front door frowning with dissatisfaction
im not staying here another minute
panicky no mrs
korda rushes around the display case
come here hag
he grabs a handful of the womans coiffed gray hair and drags her away from the door
the manager takes a step toward korda
leave her alone
korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager
youre a brave one arent you
the manager glares at him
hes about kordas size
he thinks about making a run at him
pleading sit down doug
a long beat
the manager sits back down on the floor with the other hostages
salesgirl is giving aid to the old woman
korda looks down at her
if shes not conscious when its time to leave ill have to kill her
korda goes back to the display cases to collect the rest of the gems
cops clear spectators out of the way as a green ford explorer rumbles through the barricade and heads down the deserted street
roper and mccall at the window attention fixed on the store
the explorer crawls to a stop in front of the jewelry store
parks at a slight angle
the uniformed police officer gets out leaving the engine running and walks off back to the barricade
time to give this fucker a call
roper picks up the phone waits
everybody tensely watching the store
sequence omitted from original script
a sniper team watching the store from a third floor window
roper holding the phone
its still ringing
another sharpshooting team
and still another sharpshooter team
the phone is still ringing
this fuckers not answering
just then the front door of the jewelry store swings open
a spray of white vapor shoots out the doorway
korda is discharging a fire extinguisher
theres your answer
hes cutting down the visibility
and doing a very good job of it
a thick cloud of white hangs over the sidewalk obscuring the front of the jewelry store
roper puts down the phone
give us one clean shot
into his radio all positions you have the green light
roper grabs a pair of binoculars
through the haze we catch glimpses of the hostages circled around the figure in the ski mask
they slowly shuffle toward the explorer
mccall watches intently
a sniper watches through his scope
finger poised on the trigger
low visibility through the haze
the figure in the ski mask wavers in and out of the crosshairs shielded momentarily by the jeweler then he flashes back into the crosshairs
the sniper tries to lock him in
the figure in the ski mask leans slightly and roper catches a glimpse of the hostage right behind him
roper recognizes him instantly
mccall sees him now too
they switched clothes
roper drops the binoculars and grabs his police radio
urgently hold your fire
hold your fire
a shot rings out
the figure in the ski mask goes down hit by the bullet
whered that shot come from
hold your fire
more shots ring out
the white vapor cloud swirls
the hostages spattered with blood scream and scatter
the figure in the ski mask lies dead on the sidewalk
korda dressed in the managers three piece suit holding the satchel of jewels in one hand and his gun in the other fires back at the snipers
he grabs salesgirl and drags her into the explorer
roper sees korda move toward the car with one of the hostages
hes got the girl
as roper turns into the room he notices a set of keys on solis desk
grabbing the keys to solis are these yours
yeah they are but
to mccall come on
as roper and mccall move toward the door
roper what are you going to do
dont take my
and roper and mccall are gone
police come rushing onto the street
the explorer roars off down the block
roper and mccall burst out of the command center building leap into solis cadillac and tear off after the van
mccall is behind the wheel
sequence omitted from original script
the explorer comes barreling toward it
two squad cars screech up behind the barricades trying to block kordas escape
the explorer plows through the metal barricades
bashes the squad cars out of the way
and screams off around the corner
sequence omitted from original script
the explorer careens up an alley and bursts into the congested traffic of a side street
a toyota swerves to miss it and broadsides a parked car
the explorer fishtails off down the street
the salesgirl is terrified
korda checks the rear view mirror
no one on his tail
then the cadillac comes speeding up behind
roper and mccall have the van in sight about a block ahead
roper picks up the radio
suspect heading west on sutter now passing jones
can we get an intercept
a voice comes back
we are proceeding south on hyde
korda has one eye on the road and the other on the rear view mirror
the cadillac is making up ground
a squad car screeches into the intersection and smokes to a stop
korda jerks the wheel pulls a screaming right turn and heads up the hill
the cadillac is only about a hundred feet behind the van
brakes squealing it swerves around the corner in pursuit
hits the top of the hill and goes airborne
slams back down to the pavement
korda floors it and we get a frightening view out the windshield as they head straight downhill
the salesgirl is beyond petrified
reaches the top of the hill
as it rocks forward violently
front bumper slamming against the pavement
mccall sees the van ahead
hammers the accelerator
korda sees traffic ahead
he pulls a hard left
cuts straight across the corner
up on the sidewalk
shears a mailbox
a row of newspaper machines fly through the air
the van speeds off down a one way street
arrives at the intersection a few seconds later
intersection still jammed
people now standing on the corner gawking at the damage
the caddy screeches to a stop
the people scatter
the cadillac drives through the corner
wrong way down a one way street
cars coming right at us in every angle
no way to avoid collision
except korda pulls a left an instant before impact
the van speeds back up the hill
down the same one way street
comes up on the head on traffic now stopped paralyzed with fear from the near collision with korda
the cadillac roars around the corner and heads up the hill
korda checking the rear view mirror
the caddy is a short distance behind
attention still focused behind korda enters an intersection running a red light
pulls on the wheel the van swerves
but not quick enough
the van rolls over another car
korda and the salesgirl tossed about as the van does a dizzying roll
and crashes back down to the street upside down
after a beat korda crawls from the wreckage carrying the satchel of jewels
the salesgirl does not emerge
he spots a cable car reaching the top of the hill and starting its long descend
he heads toward it
as korda comes toward them from the wreckage some of the passengers view him uneasily
hits the top of the hill just in time for rope and mccall to see korda leap onto the moving cable car
other passengers give korda room
they can sense that he is not here merely for the ride
korda looks out the back
roper and mccall havent lost track of him
the cadillac is making up ground on the cable car
korda moves to the back exit pulls his gun and fires off a couple of shots at the caddy
a bullet fractures the windshield
that makes up the minds of many of the passenger
they leap off the cable car
korda takes aim on the caddy again and fires
the brakeman charges down the aisle while korda has his attention focused out the back and tries to shove him off the cable car
but korda is able to hang on by one hand
he swings around toward the brakeman who turns involuntarily as he sees the barrel of the gun pointed at him
korda shoots him in the back
the brakeman staggers down the aisle and slumps across the brake lever releasing it more
the brakes are stressed
now driverless the cable car picks up speed
broadsides a car
pushing it into parked cars
korda and the remaining passengers are rocked around
thunders towards us
filling the frame
shows the cable car leaving the wreckage in its wake
it passes the smashed car
mccall looks at the speedometer as he paces the cable car
its going at mph
what the fuck is going on
i dont know but ive got to get on there
pull up alongside
the cable car barrels through
plows into two cross traffic cars
knocks them aside
keeps picking up speed
weaves through the wreckage
makes up ground on the cable car trying to pull alongside
for the moment korda is not shooting at the caddy
his attention is now focused downhill as
the cable car nails another vehicle sending it spinning off to the side
dodges the spinning car
jumps up onto the sidewalk
mows down parking meters
jumps back onto the street
korda leans out the door takes aim at the caddy
another jammed intersection up ahead
he sees the cable car coming in his rear view mirror
he bails out
slams into the back of the car
korda and the passengers are thrown to the floor
tumbles down the hill
hits a car coming uphill and rolls into a parked car
speeds up alongside the cable car
roper climbs over the windshield onto the hood and leaps onto the cable car
korda sees him coming
roper dives out the other side of the cable car
roper hanging off the side
he gets his gun out of his holster
up ahead a car pulls away from the curb
roper swings around to get back into the relative safety of the cable car
as he does his gun is raked out of his hand by the car which avoids a collision by a millimeter
korda aims as roper re enters
as it crashes into the back of a car turning left
everyone is thrown toward the front of the car
kordas gun goes flying
roper dives on top of him
they trade punches
mccall is in b
with the caddy pacing the cable car
pedestrains bolt out of the way as the cable car streaks through
roper hammers korda into unconsciousness
outside mccall is honking and yelling like crazy
roper looks over
mccall points ahead
the cable car
leaps to the brake lever
pulls on it
the clamp tries to slow the descent
it whine and smokes
then disintegrates before our eyes
roper feels the lever go slack in his hands
the cable car is speeding toward the end of the line
no way to stop it
roper turns and takes a running leap into the caddy
he lands in the passenger seat
roper pounds his foot down on the accelerator
the caddy lunges ahead of the cable car
mccall cant figure out what hes doing
roper yanks the steering wheel hard right
the caddy collides with the front of the cable car
the steel wheels clatter
a cloud of burning rubber forms
the cable car grinds forward pushing the cadillac
but its working
the cable car is slowing
the crowd now sees the caddy and cable car bearing down on them
general hysteria as they flee
korda regains consciousness
sees whats going on
he grabs the satchel and bails out of the cable car
onto the hood of a passing taxi
the taxi slams on its brakes
korda rolls off the hood picks himself up and runs into an underground garage
grinding to a halt just short of the end of the line
roper grabs mccalls gun off the seat and leaps out of the caddy to pursue korda
people approach to ogle the two vehicles in astonishment
roper moves up an interior stairway gun in ready position
he knows korda is somewhere in the parking structure
he glides up the stairway to the third level
checks back over the rail
no one around
then a sound from inside the garage
roper carefully opens the door
swings in with his gun
lots of cars but no one in sight
roper moves quickly to the protection of a row of cars
he crouches down
scans beneath the cars
no sign of korda
roper searches between two rows
comes up beside a van
thinks he hears something stirring inside
whirls a gun toward the window
a dog lunges at the camera
roper moves on
as a bmw crawls through the parking structure
roper steps into the foreground right into its path gun visible
the bmw rolls to a stop
roper approaches with caution
roper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened year old blonde
roper takes a check out of the backseat
the woman rolls up the window and hits the gas
she drives off
roper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final scan
he has the discouraging feeling that korda might have escaped
he heads toward the exit
suddenly a screech of tires
roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him
he drives and fires
bullets shatter the windshield
the car continues toward roper
he has to roll out of the path of the car
the car swerves past roper
tries to make it down the ramp
roper fires again taking out the rear window and a rear tire
the car slides along the guard rail and continues down to the next level
roper runs after it
as the car reaches the next level korda loses control and piles into a parked car
korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel of jewels
dazed he staggers away from the wreck
roper moves to him with a face grim as death
he strips the satchel from kordas hand and slams him against the open car door
korda goes to his knees
roper holds the barrel of his gun right up between kordas eyes
give me one reason why i shouldnt kill you right here
korda stares back at roper defiantly
he knows a cop wont kill him in cold blood
what he doesnt know is that roper doesnt give a shit about those rules at this moment
you know sam baffert was a friend of mine
he had a wife
and he had a daughter
korda stares past the barrel of the gun
i dont give a shit about you or your fucking friends
and that makes roper even angrier
but he keeps it all inside
his expression is as cold as a san francisco night
he yanks back hard on kordas hair
pushes the gun tighter against kordas forehead
hes on the verge of executing this guy
you cant kill me like this
what if you and me got into a struggle
and my gun went off
in a flash roper points the gun upward and fires off a shot
could i kill you then
beat beat could i kill you then
roper jams the gun back under kordas chin
a pull of the trigger would send a bullet straight up through kordas skull
and now korda is fully convinced
he squeezes his eyes closed
face straining so hard he looks like hes going to burst out of his skin
moving across garage into position
put it down
put it down man we got him
beat come on
put it down
long long beat
roper eases up and korda smiles
just when we feel the scene is over roper turns back quickly and kicks korda in the stomach then grabs korda by the hair pulls his head back and shoves
the gun in his face
we do this shit by the book but you aint gonna be smiling
korda is doubled up coughing spitting up blood
roper walks away as mccall moves in to put the cuffs on korda
sequence omitted from original script
roper is sitting in a cubicle doing paperwork
a group of reporters and photographers move down the hallway adjoining the squadroom
one of them is ronnie
through the glass walls she notices roper sitting alone at the computer
she bids good night to the reporters and comes into the squadroom
you werent at the press conference
roper keeps tapping away at the computer
i wanted to get this out of the way
you got a bet on the game tonight
as a matter of fact i do
she nods knowingly
its already started
i was going to catch the last half on tv
ronnie watches him for a moment
he stops typing looks at her and smiles
she suddenly becomes self conscious
guess it was something she was thinking
she turns abruptly to leave
roper finds himself rising from his chair
you having dinner with mr
she turns back around
greg is on a road trip
i was just going to make some pasta
he takes a few steps toward
that kind with the garlic and the oil that i like so much
the kind from kraft with the macaroni and the cheese
ive been craving that stuff all week
and its hard to get
he looks at her innocently
sequence omitted from original script
ronnie is making macaroni
roper helps to prepare a dressing to go with the salad
he is mixing oil vinegar sugar and spices
he lets her have a taste
what do you think
mmm needs a little something
what are you talking about
this is it
this is the stuff right here
beat he tastes well maybe just a pinch more sugar
yeah thats it
why dont you just stick your finger in and stir it up
there is a long pause as he looks at her
what would you say if i quit gambling
ronnie stirs the macaroni
id say youd be miserable
its not the gambling
its what the gambling got in the way of
the track is where youd take your troubles instead of sharing them with me
ronnie puts the lid on the macaroni
there is a beat before she continues
scottie remember the day you lost that hostage in union square
you came over that night and we made mad crazy love
but i didnt even know what happened
til i heard it on the news the next morning
its because i wanted to keep you away from that world
its not that world
its your world
its part of who you are
beat veronica its not easy for me
i dont know if i can change overnight
but what im telling you is that i want to share everything with you because i dont ever want to be without you again
the dog yawns
roper moves closer to her
he kisses her and she responds
the lovemaking is over
roper is gazing at the ceiling thinking
ronnie is cuddled around him
a comfortable moment
what about greg
what are you gonna tell him
we broke up
clarence teal kordas cousin sits in front of the plexiglass wall
hes edgy fidgety
clarence doesnt like to make visits to jail
korda wearing prison clothes is led in by a guard
korda takes a seat at the other side of the plexiglass wall and picks up the receiver
clarence picks up his receiver
how ya doin man
korda grips the phone leans forward and stares through the wall
you gotta do something for me
this fucker roper hes gotta girlfriend
she works at the newspaper
i want you to take care of her
clarence is totally unnerved by this request
hey michael thats not my thing
korda glares at him murderously
you gotta do this for me
im in here because of you
man whats this about
ya know you were robbing a store
it wasnt personal
it was his job
exploding fuck you
you know what he did to me
korda starts to draw the attention of the guard
he controls himself lowers his voice
but the viciousness is still there
he held a gun to my head and said he should kill me right then
he made me
he doesnt finish that thought
you do this for me clarence
clarence is getting very upset
dont make do it mike
are you going to turn on me too
who helped you when you were strung out
who gave you money
who bailed you out of jail
i wont get away with it
nobody knows who you are
make it look like a robbery
clarence holds back tears because he knows hes going to have to do this
a gray san francisco evening
it starts to rain
shes cooking some kind of sauce
she has a taste
a subjective pov watching through the window as she moves around the kitchen
ronnie pours some oil in a pan
the phone rings
she crosses the kitchen to answer it
roper on his cell phone
paco is on the seat beside him
hi im going to stop at the corner for some wine
roper notices the rain searches for the windshield wiper switch
hows paco doing
he was going nuts at the park
he met this very attractive poodle
they made plans to meet again next weekend
paco sits there panting
roper pulls the pickup over in front of the store
okay dinner will be ready when you get here
she hangs up
through the window we watch her cross back to the stove
ronnie lifts the lid on the sauce
it spatters on her blouse
she regards the stain with dismay
puts the lid back on and leaves the kitchen
ronnie unbuttons her blouse as she moves to the
she takes off the blouse goes to the closet door
throws it open
she looks around
somethings not right
she takes a step into the closet and finds what shes looking for a laundry basket tucked away in the corner
she puts the soiled blouse in the hamper and takes a fresh one off a hanger
she buttons the clean blouse as she walks to
she turns on the light
she goes to the mirrored medicine cabinet
behind her the shower curtain is drawn fluttering ever so slightly
she opens the medicine cabinet
takes out some perfume
dabs some on her neck
she puts back the bottle and closes the cabinet
we fully expect someone to be standing right behind her in the reflection
theres no one there
she turns off the light as she walks out of the bathroom
ronnie walks back to the kitchen
notices something on the floor further down the hallway
what is it
she moves closer
and now we get to the pov that tells us someone is in the house
watching her through a cracked doorway
a hand opening a buck knife
water drips from the fingers
ronnie bends down
its a wet spot
like half a shoeprint
she reaches down to touch it
the oven timer
she hurries back to the kitchen
she turns off the timer and pulls some chicken out of the oven
she puts it down on the counter and cross to the refrigerator
she opens the door and looks inside
the refrigerator door obscures half the frame
she digs around for something
were sure that when she closes the door hes going to be behind it
she takes out a head of lettuce and
closes the door
still no one there
clarence is standing there
the knife flashes forward
she grabs the lid from the sauce pan and clang
fends off the blade
she bolts for the hallway
clarence grabs her by the blouse
she pulls away
she races down the hall
clarence lunges into frame
she goes down
he goes down
the knife goes skidding down the hallway
ronnie scrambles to get it
clarence has her by the ankle
she claws for the knife
just out of reach
ropers pickup pulls up in front
he gets out
paco jumps out behind him
its raining harder
they hurry up the walkway toward the house
suddenly roper realizes he forgot the wine
he goes back to the truck
paco pads after him
roper opens the drivers side door reaches in and grabs the wine
he closes the door starts away but pauses to check himself in the window
suddenly a floodlight comes crashing through ronnies front bay windows
it sparks and flashes
still plugged in it bungees to a stop hallway down the front of the house
flickering and flashing
roper rushes toward the house
crashes through the front door
up the stairway
paco bounds after him
roper hits her front door running
he bounces off
he shoulders it again
the door doesnt give
he pulls out his gun
shoots off the lock
a quick shot of clarences hand grabbing the knife
roper kicks open the door
ronnie is laying on the floor gasping for air
choke marks around her throat
roper rushes to her side
paco is on his heels
points out the back way
to paco stay
the dog obediently stays with ronnie
roper dashes out the back
raining more heavily now
roper bursts out onto the back porch
sees clarence leaping off the last rung of the fire escape to the alley
roper flies down the fire escape
vaults the last flight and races after clarence
clarence sprints down the block
through the intersection
a car barely misses him
it does a one eighty on the rain slick pavement
clarence disappears into the shadows
roper arrives a beat later
streaks through the intersection
into the shadows
this one is steep
clarence huffs and puffs as he labors
he shoots into a doorway
tries the door
he looks back
roper is coming
he rushes across the steep street
almost slips on the reflective asphalt
roper spots him crossing and picks up the pace
he can see that clarence is faltering
clarence staggers into an alleyway
narrow dark and dripping with rain
roper arrives at the mouth of the alley
gun ready he moves cautiously eyes adjusting to the darkness
the patter of rain off the rooftops
no other sound
he reaches the end of the alley
a brick wall
no way out
or so it would seem
however clarence is nowhere in sight
roper turns back
brick walls tower on both sides rising into darkness
roper checks a steel door
he checks another one on the opposite side of the alley
where did clarence go
he moves back toward the misting light of the street
the faint rattle of a fire escape
and clarence leaps down out of the shadow
slashing with the knife
he catches roper across the arm
rips through his clothes right down to the skin
ropers gun clatters under a parked car and into the street
clarence has first jump
he scrambles into the street around the car and grabs the gun
roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks clarence down before he can aim
they roll into the middle of the street
both have a death grip on the weapon
clarence fights like a trapped animal
roper pins him on his back but cant pry the gun out of his fingers
headlights radiate over the crest of the hill
roper sees this
he rolls out of the way abandoning the battle for the gun
clarence struggles to his knees
turns the weapon on roper
a speeding cab lunges over the top of the hill
clarence turns trapped in the searing headlights
clarence is transfixed
hes launched through the air like a ragdoll
his body lands limply feet down the street
the cabby gets out of his vehicle
what was he doing
roper walks down the hill to the body
the cabby follows
there was no way i could miss him
roper ignores the cabby
he looks down at clarences body contemplating something
this isnt my fault
shut the fuck up
the cabby immediately clams up
get on your radio and get the police here
roper stares at clarences body steel eyed
korda is led in again
an expression of surprise registers on his face when he sees whos waiting for him
roper is sitting stoically behind the plexiglass wall
dons a smug expression and takes a seat
he picks up his receiver as roper picks up his
if you try again to hurt me or anyone i know im going to have you killed
korda feigns total innocence
what in the world are you talking about mr
roper takes out a photograph and holds it up against the glass
heres a picture of your cousin clarence
that gentleman standing over him is the coroner
kordas face tightens
he drops the innocent act
his countenance is now a study in hate
i used to have an apartment a car jewelry
i had a fucking eight thousand dollar watch
now look what i have
he motions around
youre threatening me
you think i give a fuck
you think you can scare me off
a laugh why dont you come in here and kick my ass
get some of your guard friends in here to help
id like that
roper glares at him mounting rage
smirking he really shook you up didnt he
ive got ten years worth of appeals to figure out how to fuck with you
maybe some scumbag lawyer will get me out on a technicality
roper sits there suddenly feeling powerless
you came here to threaten me
thats a laugh
maybe you should beg me
get down on your knees
roper leaps from his chair and smashes the receiver against the plexiglass wall
you motherfucker i swear ill kill you
the guard rushes over and restrains roper
wrestles him away from the glass wall
roper pushes him off and gathers himself
he gives korda one last stare
korda sits there smirking back at him
roper turns his back and walks out
mccall is practicing his negotiating techniques in a mirror
im here to help you
not quite right
he adjusts his stance
this time puts a little hand movement into it
im here to help you
talk to me
hes still not satisfied
sequence omitted from original script
captain solis pokes his head in the door hes been looking for mccall
we got a situation at the v
the responding officer has requested a negotiator
hes on his way
get over there
a veteran wearing green fatigue is dangling another wheelchair bound vet over the edge
fourteen floors up
the two front wheels are literally hanging out there in space
rambling incoherently i cant fight this technology
they have microprocessors made in totally sterile environments
ive seen those places
everyone is dressed in white
its like paper clothing man
theyre not even human
vet is struggling to stay in the chair and not be tipped into the street feet below
he is needless to say very panicky
dave dont do this bro
pull me in
well do a few laps in the park and figure out some other way
but hes not getting through to his friend
i cant help this man
do you have any idea what those microchips look like
how small they are when they put them in your brain
leading to the roof
a couple of cops and members of the hospital staff peek out at the vet as he continues to rant and rave
mccall arrives at the top of the stairs
officer sure looks happy to see him
mccall takes a peek out onto the roof
he isnt happy about what he sees
when we got here he was already doing his balancing act
i was talking to him but it made him more agitated so i backed off
why is he up there
something about a microchip in his brain
who is he
a nurse answers him
he likes to be called dave
the other guy is walter sinclair
we hear the urgent cry of the vet in the wheelchair
somebody help me out here
somebody stop him
the nurse turns to mccall
what are you waiting for
another negotiator is on his way
we cant wait for another negotiator
you have to do something
what about the doctors
he hates all the doctors
he says theyre in on the conspiracy
where is everybody
hes going to kill me
mccall takes a deep breath and steps out onto the roof
mccall moves slowly across the tar paper roof
clouds overhead threaten rain
vet turns to him suddenly wobbling the wheelchair
vet shrieks and nearly goes over
mccalls heart jumps into his mouth
get the fuck out of here
mccall is tense and stiff
i m here to help you d
you cant help me man
so much for mccalls opener
hes high on something man
give him some thorazine or something
dave ignores walter
no one can help me
theyre controlling my mind
mccall moves a couple steps closer
whos controlling your mind
they control everybodys mind
youre too fucking stupid to know that
mccall fumbles for the right response
this has nothing to do with walter
they want walter dead
cops keep spectators back from the building
fire trucks and rescue vehicles are on the scene
everybody looking straight up watching the wheelchair with its occupant dangling over the side of the building
walter sits stock still in the wheelchair drenched with sweat eyes closed praying
dave look at me
he looks at mccall with eyes that have lost the battle for sanity
mccall is momentarily frozen by those eyes
beads of sweat have formed on his forehead
tell me whats wrong
i feel them all the time
i feel them in my arms and legs man thats how they punish me
how can i help you with the particles
its not just the particles man its the whole fucking machine this is how they get assassins to operate
its been this way since the cuban missile crisis
dave starts to look over into the street he tips walter forward walter shrieks in mortal fear
white knuckles the armrests of his wheelchair and then blurting out they have less power over you if you look into my eyes
mccall even surprises himself with that one
it was a sheer act of desperation
he holds his breath and waits to see what the effect is
dave turns back around
ropers truck comes speeding down the street lurches to a halt
he leaps out and speaks to a fireman
whata ya got
some nuts dangling a guy over the edge in a wheelchair
can you get a net out here
its floors up
no nets gonna hold a fall from that high up
mccall nods slowly
sweat pouring off him
weve been onto them for a long time
a glimmer from dave
maybe mccall is a kindred spirit
let me show you something
now hes got daves interest
mccall slowly takes out his beeper
im jamming them dave
im jamming their frequency so they cant control your mind anymore
dont you feel that
you dont have to do what they say
dave listens to his head
hes jamming them dave
pull me back in
you see the particles are gone they cant punish you anymore
dave tries to feel for particles
tears form in daves eyes
tell my dad
tell him what what do you want me to tell him
tell my dad im sorry about the watch
ill tell him
where does he live
well get him on the phone right now
dave is suddenly lost in thought again
his expression turns to a frown i hate fucking springfield
is that where youre family lives
then with sudden swiftness
i still hear them man
you cant jam them
theyve got the technology man
theyve got the satellites jack
they keep shooting beams off those satellites
what power do i have
dave pushes the wheelchair forward
mccall lunges for the wheelchair but doesnt make it
walter screams as he falls
freefall down toward earth in slow motion
the wheelchair turns end over end
people scream as walter impacts with the pavement
the wheelchair crashes down nearby
sequence omitted from original script
mccall looks over the edge at walters twisted body below
then he grabs dave and wrestles him down cuffing his hands behind his back
the cops and medical staff members rush out to restrain
the crowd is dispersing
roper is talking with some of the other cops
mccall storms out of the vet hospital and down the stairs
roper moves toward him
mccall gets into his nd sedan car and fires it up
roper races over and manages to jump in just as the car screeches away from the curb
mccall doesnt even seem to have registered that roper is in the car with him
roper studies him for a beat
where are we going
moving pov thru windshield of car we see a freeway sign that says golden gate racetrack
establish grand stands
sequence omitted from original script
mccall pounds over to the betting window
roper leans up against the window beside him
give me a twenty dollar four six exacta
the six is scratched
this throws mccall for a beat
then give me a fucking four seven exacta
the teller punches out the ticket
mccall takes the ticket and pounds over to box seat area
roper follows a couple of steps behind giving him some space
mccall sits down in the same box as the last time
roper sits down next to him
the horses go into the gate
mccall watches intently as the horses spring from the gate
the track announcers call plays over the scene
come on four horse
come on seven horse
roper isnt watching the horse
hes watching mccall
watching him redirect all his pent up emotion
understanding exactly how he feels
mccall is screaming his head off
come on four seven
the horses cross the wire
the four and seven finish mid pack
mccall hangs his head in despair
he didnt give a shit about the race
he looks inconsolable
it might have happened no matter who was up there
would it have happened to you
theres one thing you have to remember
you dont create the situations
you can only try to save people from them
i thought i could do it
i was so damn sure of myself
but i didnt know what to say
the words wouldnt come
my mouth turned to mush
you make it look so easy roper
but it is not
its not easy
beat its a different job than looking through the rifle scope
that it is
a long silent beat
how many have you lost
i look at it as how many ive saved
thats the way youve got to look at it
and what about the ones you dont save
you live with it
and they haunt you
it doesnt leave
and what if you cant live with it
youve got to decide that for yourself
mccall squeezes his eyes closed
he can still see that vet falling to his death
roper can see mccalls pain
ive lost three
one of them was my partner
i think about them every time i go into a situation
a beat theres a million people in this city with all kinds of twisted shit going on in their heads and the bitch of this job is that we expect
to go out every day and do the impossible to somehow control all this craziness
and we cant
a beat nobodys faulting you for this mccall
my advice is you let yourself off the hook
mccall hears him but is still undecided
i dont know
i dont know
roper gets up stands over mccall puts a hand on his shoulder
lets get out of here
mccall slowly gets up and they walk out
its a small interview room
korda sits opposite bail bondsman john hawkins white grizzled forty
what the fuck
you bring me all the way over here to tell me youve got no collateral
what do i look like to you santa claus
im a bail bondsman
no no see what im sayin is ive got the pick up a fucking phone for chrissake

hey hey i got shit on the outside
i got somebody cashing it in for me and hawkins gets up and goes to the door
gimme a fuckin break
alright alright look man look just leave me your card
i can get it to you by tomorrow night
hawkins looks at him skeptically for a beat
then pulls out his business card and hands it to him
he walks out the door as we hold on korda pocketing the card
close up of a glass of wine being poured
pull back to reveal roper and ronnie all dressed up for a special evening
the waiter hovers as roper tastes the wine
snootily it has a nice nose
the special this evening is braised sweetbreads with a white truffle sauce on cracked bulgar
roper looks at him a long beat
thats my favorite
smiles why dont you give us a minute
the waiter retreats
roper looks across the table at ronnie as she sips her wine
you like this place
its very nice
i guess you realize that theres something special that i want to talk to you about
she didnt realize that
now shes getting nervous
for the last week things have been going pretty well between us
i think weve been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff
now shes really worried
let me just show you
roper reaches into his coat pocket
scottie we should think this over before we
he pulls out two airline tickets
ronnie is immensely relieved
yeah that sounds like a great idea
roper notices her relief and for the first time realizes what she was thinking
oh you thought i was going to ask you
ronnie averts her eyes a bit embarrassed
oh no no no no no
lets go to tahiti first and see if that works out
roper picks up his menu and peruses it
i assume youre having your usual the air dried venison
the wheels of a laundry cart moving slowly down the hall
a white metal door slides open and the cart passes through
as the cart rolls into the room tilt up to see pushing the cart
a guard guard stands with his back to korda
hes on the phone
got another load
rack em up
into the phone look man if it doesnt make it down here by five its not my problem
as the guard continues korda hangs several garment bags zipped and tagged onto an electric trolley similar to the kind used by dry cleaners to move clothing
korda pushes a button and the trolley starts to move
the guard still on the phone buzzes open the door
we hear korda wheeling the cart out the door
on the door sliding shut
hold a beat
panning slowly around the room to find suit bags moving on the trolley
boom down to find kordas feet just as they lift off the ground and disappear behind the bags
hanging onto the trolley as it moves along the wall and then down through an opening in the floor and into
as it loops around a large room carrying him toward the back wall
the metal ridges of the trolley cut into his fingers drawing blood
then he drops down and quietly rummages through other bags of clothing
he tries on a pair of pants but they come up to his ankles
he looks like hes about to go wading
as he rips them off and reaches for another pair
korda appears around a corner dressed in street clothes holding a clipboard moving steadily toward camera
a female civilian employee heading in his direction
as they pass he nods and she nods back
then korda passes through a door at the end of the hallway and into
sequence omitted from original script
the door closes behind him and locks with the loud snap of metal
slowly with deliberate steps he moves down the corridor toward the door at the other end past the first guard guard enclosed in bullet proof glass
step by step
the voices of prisoners muffled behind thick glass
trying to stay cool his heart pounding
korda freezes then slowly turns to find
a prison guard moving toward him
the guard then stops in front of him and holds up his hand
you dropped your card
korda takes the card given to him by the bail bondsman
you guys are the scum of the earth
just tryin to make a living
korda turns and walks out the door into
its the final step before getting out of the building
a small room with another guard latino guard behind glass and several tv monitors
a black woman forty five is arguing with a latino guard
i dont know what to tell you mam your brother aint here
try san bruno
i just came from san bruno they sent me here
then i dont know where he is
korda fidgeting behind the woman impatiently holds up his card
listen can i just sign outta here
what do you mean you dont know where he is
you cant just lose somebody
to korda who are you again
i gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes alright
to korda can you believe these people
its the criminal justice system
what can i tell ya
its a mess
the guard shoves the sheet under the glass
alright alright just sign
korda signs the sheet
the guard pushes a button
the metal lock snaps and the door pops open
korda takes his card and sticks it in the womans coat pocket
if you find him gimme a call
and korda walks out
its a small parking area with security gates on either end and a ceiling of heavy steel wire open to the sky
there are three or four cars parked against the wall
korda checks inside the first car looking for keys and finds none
then the second and the third until
korda turns sharply to find the latino guard guard holding a clipboard walking quickly toward him
hold on a second here
is there a problem
the guard walks up to him
theyre standing between the cars
you signed out twice
look why dont you just come on back inside for a second
wait a minute lemme see that
as the guard shows him the sign in sheet korda removes the pen from his own clipboard
well thats funny i wonder how that happened
in a flash korda plunges the pen deep into the guards throat
the blood jumps out of his throat onto the window of the car as the guard gagging in stunned silence slumps to ground
he then falls backward between the two cars drowning in his own blood

new front door
frame splintered from when roper shot it open
we hold a beat
hear roper ronnie coming up the stairs
the door opens
how come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat old guy
in europe women find older men very sexy
roper closes the door
when i get old and fat im moving to europe
ronnie suddenly remembers something
i forgot to leave food for paco
hes probably starving
she walks back toward the kitchen
roper takes a seat on the couch
flips on the tv
rubs the back of his neck
damn my eyes are tired from reading that movie
she moves down the hall to the kitchen
doggie voice im sorry paco
i forgot but paco isnt lying on his pillow like she expected
she turns around walks back down the hall
where could he be
she walks into the bedroom
hes not in here either
she walks back into the hallway
a figure leaps out of the bathroom doorway
he nearly knocked her over
he stands on his hind legs paws on her shoulders
breathing in her face
paco have you been eating my face soap again
roper standing at the other end of the hallway
tense as a wire
gun at his side
one look at his demeanor tells ronnie something is very wrong
very concerned what is it scottie
puts away his gun
and you think hell
her voice trails off
he can see shes worried now too
hey im on edge a little
im sure hes just going to try to get out of town
anyway we leave tomorrow
he puts his arms around her waist
why dont we do some of that european movie stuff
she puts her arms around his shoulders
i dont think youre old and fat enough for me
use your imagination
angle looking up at her window
the light goes out
a suitcase thumps to the ground
looks like somebody packed for a six month trip around the world
mccall grimaces as he lugs the bag toward the truck
you sure you packed everything
maybe you forgot your bowling ball
ronnie stands on the doorstep
i sent that ahead wise guy
paco is on the sidewalk exploring from tree to tree
roper calls to ronnie from the stairway
why dont you come back up with me ronnie
i think ill stand out here in the sun
roper is still very edgy
its better if you stay inside
she climbs up the stairs toward him
youve got to calm down sequence omitted from original script
roper reaches the top of the stairs
ronnie come on baby we gotta go
time to get movin
roper moves into the room listening
theres no response
she doesnt answer
he calls out again moving through the living room
continuing ronnie where are you
time to go
no answer the room is very quiet
roper eases his pistol out from under his shirt moving more urgently now checking out the bathroom bedroom
then he hears paco whining
he moves around the entrance to the kitchen
the back door is open paco standing in the doorway
roper rushes forward quickly looking outside the alley way empty
he senses a presence behind him spinning
mccall standing in the doorway to the kitchen
ropers lowers the weapon
continuing shes gone
mccall sees on the kitchen table a folded piece of glassine paper just like the one korda gave roper at the jewelry store
roper sees it approaching barely able to unfold the edges a momentary tremble in his hand
that son of a bitch
we push in as his fingers open the paper
revealing inside a micro cassette tape
continuing to himself hes fucking with you scott be cool
keep your head
close on a tape recorder kordas voice heard over the speaker
filtered i got your lady roper
laughs roper and mccall are listening closely to the tape
continuing you got something that belongs to me and i want it back
beat twelve fifteen mare island north entrance off dixon
building twenty eight by the dry docks

roper punches off the tape
hes gonna kill her no matter what
if i take him these jewels hes gonna kill me and her
so what do you want to do
thats a chance i gotta take
then we better get moving
but theres no way we can get the jewels out of evidence
roper stares at him the wheels beginning to turn
sequence omitted from original script
roper is standing at the counter to the steel caged property room
on the other side is frank the property sergeant on duty
the two men speak in hushed urgent tones
scott we go back a long way but you cant expect me to do this
frank this guy is a psychopath and hes got ronnie

i got one chance with this guy frank alone
beat he killed sam and hell kill her
frank just stares at him compassion and anger tearing at him
continuing what if it were mary

frank continues to stare at him a long beat
i hope to god i never have to make that decision
he pushes back from the counter
continuing and this conversation never happened
i never saw you today
now i gotta go take a leak
he turns and walks away
roper looks down seeing that the drawer beneath franks counter has been left slightly open
roper reaches over easing it further open inside a set of keys
he looks around then takes the keys
i owe you one frank
he walks down the hallway
close on the satchel korda used in the robbery
widen to reveal roper and mccall roper at the wheel mccall reading a folded map featuring mare island
mare island is an abandoned shipyard cranes high buildings
hell be in place where he can see everything
to roper how are we going to get me in there
roper thinks a moment then turns looking out the back of the pickup in the bed a loose canvas tarpaulin
he and mccall study the tarp a beat then turn looking at each other
wide view reveals the immensity of the abandoned facility
at one end near the chain link fence ropers pickup approaches the gate
roper cautiously drives toward the gate the chain securing the gate has been cut
roper swings open the gate
as he drives past we see that the bed of the truck has been loosely covered with a tarp
roper drives on winding through the maze of roadways huge buildings and equipment dwarfing the truc production note the idea is to take us into the facility to sell that
its abandoned immense eerie in its scale a ghost town
we end up wherever we want for the next scene
as he rounds a corner approaching the dry dock area huge cranes and mothballed ships in the b
he parks near a building a weathered sign reading bld
roper shuts off the engine leaving the keys in the ignition
taking the satchel he opens the door
roper steps out eyes scanning the buildings the cranes
korda could be anywhere up there watching
kordas pov through the filthy windows roper far below standing beside his pickup
as he moves away from the truck holding the satchel
in response he hears kordas voice eerie almost a whisper coming from everywhere and nowhere as if emanating from the ground and the buildings all at once
filtered nice of you to make it roper
take your jacket off put it on the hood
roper complies his eyes searching the buildings where is his voice coming from
continuing now over to the chains to your left
roper sees a chained off section nearby
roper takes a few steps when kordas voice stops him
continuing but first lets have a look under the tarp
pull it back
a momentary anxious look from roper then he walks to the bed of the truck pausing a moment gripping the cover before whipping it back revealing
mccall supported under the frame by a makeshift harness around his waist and legs
all right move it
mccall watches as roper heads away then releases the harness lowering himself to the ground
quickly he moves the smoking leather gloves he was wearing burned by contact with the hot exhaust pipe
reaches the the chained area revealing an empty dry dock easily one hundred feet deep and five hundred long
at the bottom of the dry dock is a portable radio the acoustics of natural amphitheater so intense you could hear a whisper the source of kordas voice
continuing throw in and your piece
roper tosses his pistol into the dry dock
and your back up
roper removes the pistol from his ankle holster tossing it
kordas voice cuts the eerie silence
continuing walk under the cranes and down the alleyway
at the end turn right
building thirty six
the radio clicks off
roper walks towards the megalith cranes passing under them then heads down the alleyway created by the tall buildings
mccall his rifle case on his chest watches as roper turns the corner and heads down the alley way
mccall rolls out scrambling for the cover of the building
slinging the case over his shoulder he finds a ladder leading up the side of the building beginning to climb
walking down the alley way nearing the end
mccall moving along the edge looking down
he spots roper moving fast to keep him in sight
he comes to the edge of the building having to walk across a narrow ramp to get to the next building
he looks down roper turning the corner mccall moves on removing the rifle from its case as he goes
leaves the alleyway a complex of hanger like buildings revealed
to his far right is a building a sign reading bld
he clutches the satchel heading towards it
mccall negotiating another precarious crossing between buildings
he spots roper eyes quickly searching the roof tops and buildings for the snipers position
he sees it across the way a location covering the buildings where roper is now walking
he heads out
walking towards building passing by a towering glass fronted building on his right his eyes are searching the roof tops of the buildings around him
to himself where the hell are you mccall
as roper passes a set of partially open rolling doors to the glass fronted building hes startled by kordas voice from within right there roper
ropers eyes go to building still fifty yards away
roper stops slowly turning towards the doors
come on in theres someone just dying to see you
he turns a bit in profile eyes searching
loudly where are you
pov telescopic sight focusing on roper his lips moving
mccall heaving for breath has just dropped down into position providing a view of roper and the inside of the glass fronted building
right here scott
he touches the laser sighting attachment to his scope a red beam activated
from inside the building kordas voice get your ass in here roper
just as roper starts to move he sees the red laser dot on the back of his hand mccall is up there right behind him
roper moves inside
lying prone inside the operators booth steadies his rifle looking through the scope
telescopic pov he can see roper enter his field of vision limited inside the building where the light penetrates the room cast in hard shadows
he moves to the windows all either painted white or so obscured with grime and dirt he can only see vague shapes and shadows inside
he moves back to the opening roper now just inside
stay cool real easy
cavernous and dark a jungle of huge machines lathes and equipment once used in the design of nuclear submarines
roper moves a few feet inside remaining in the light and keeping his face in three quarter profile to mccalls position
where is she korda
i want to see her
from the darkness beyond
walk to the table
roper walks to a steel shop table
continuing open your shirt
im not wearing a wire
this is just between you and me
shut the fuck up and do what i say
roper puts down the satchel unbuttoning his shirt holding it open
open the bag dump everything on the table
roper opens the bag the jewelry and the dozens of glassine envelopes spill out onto the table
he lays the satchel on its side the bottom facing roper
taped to the bottom is a short barreled
its all there
spread it out
roper spreads the pile out across the top of the table
only the jewels korda youve got my word
a long beat
show me something
without looking roper reaches to the pile of glassine palmed in his hand the envelope containing ronnies diamond
roper without looking digs into the pile holding up the glassine envelope between his fingers still holding the palmed envelope
he starts to toss the envelope in his fingers
continuing not that one
roper hesitates then drops the envelope his hand moving over the pile
continuing right there the one in front
yeah that one
roper reaches for the envelope
as he flips the palmed envelope into his fingers with the skill of a card shark exchanging it for the one korda indicated
he tosses it across the room
from the shadows kordas hand reaches out picking it up
a long beat
continuing im impressed
i didnt think you could do it
what did you have to do steal them
wry thats not going to look too good on your service record
ill worry about that
lets get on with it
korda laughs as he slowly emerges from the darkness
my sentiments exactly
on the floor he sees a shadow cast korda
he moves to the windows
inside the vague blurred outline of a man
his scope goes back to the satchel and the
taped to the bottom
wait for the right moment scott
korda moves closer to the light tossing an athletic bag to roper in his hand an automatic pistol
fill it up
just in case theres a homing device in the other one
roper slides the jewels into the second bag eyeing the
on the bottom of the satchel
continuing now bring it over here
roper hesitates but all he can do at this point is play for time he moves forward
watching roper as he moves away from the satchel and the gun
he moves the scope ahead of roper seeing kordas shadow cast on the floor still unable to see him
continuing all right scott bring him out
roper growing closer to kordas position
thats far enough
bag on the floor
roper hangs onto the bag theres four million in jewels in there all he has to bargain with
ive kept my end
korda reacts in mock surprise
oh shit in all the excitement i almost forgot
she right here
a light switch is thrown a bank of lights behind him coming on illuminating a massive flat bed circular lathe
ropers eyes in horror go to
tied to the lathe bed spread eagle
some distance from her body a cutting device is positioned over the lathe bed
roper looks into ronnies terrified eyes
be cool ronnie im gonna get you out of this
he turns back korda grinning at him
no shit this i gotta see
korda swings into position a control box the buttons held down with tape
korda pulls free the tape the huge lathe beginning to turn very slowly the cutting device activated
if the table keeps turning ronnies body will soon be under the blade
production note lathe will be cutting into a section of steel plate demonstrating what will happen to ronnie
korda presses the stop button the lathe stopping
he releases his finger again the lathe turning
he stops it
we can see that korda is immensely proud of his creation his focus more on sadistic payback than anything else at this point
continuing fuckin cool huh
i rewired the switch
you see you have to keep your finger on the button or the little lady gets cut
he releases the button the lathe turning towards the cutting device
he stops it again holding the button
continuing grins right in half
he eases towards roper extending his arm on the control box holding the button down
through the scope he can see korda as he steps into view
the crosshairs settle on kordas upper forehead
hold it right there
his finger tightens on the trigger
korda holds the control box towards roper
but then thats not my problem
he releases the button and the box the lathe turning korda grinning at roper
the red dot centered on kordas forehead
lights out fucker
and then ropers head fills the scope the red dot glowing on the back of his head
in shock mccall releases his finger
roper moving to the control box pressing the stop button stopping the lathe
you see its out of my hands
roper looks at the box ronnies life literally in his hands
sequence omitted from original script
through the scope ropers head blocking the shot to korda
but korda bends down picking up the bag stepping back away from roper clearly out of mccalls line of fire
well hate to run but ive got a plane to catch
you take good care of the little lady hear
as korda walks down the corridor of the huge machine shop we now see a car parked near the end facing us
korda suddenly stops turning gesturing to the car
continuing how careless of me
you see theres only one way out of here and youre standing right in the way
grins you could move but then
he shakes his head at roper
continuing sure hate to be in your shoes
he turns walking quickly towards his car talking laughing to himself
roper looks to the car then back at the satchel where the is still taped to the bottom
but roper cant move unable to change his position more than a foot or two
he looks around him no way to stop the lathe if he releases the button
he can see roper holding the box but nothing else
what the hells going on
now korda reaches his car hopping inside starting it up
in desperation roper looks back at the satchel then turns calling out
mccall stop him stop the car
korda revving the engine
mccall reading ropers lips
he swings the scope up but the back of the machine shop is blocked by his vantage point
then he hears the faint squealing of tires
he lowers his scope holding waiting
korda at the end of the long building beginning to accelerate
turns toward mccalls position
the car now screaming down the long corridor
mccall still cant see the car
the car now closing in on roper but roper holds his ground
mccall shoot the son of a bitch
korda bearing down on roper
bye bye cop
holding his position eyes widening in fear
the car comes into view the crosshairs on the windshield
but the glare off the window is obscuring any shot of korda
mccall takes aim and fires
the bullet punches through the window catching kordas left shoulder blood flying
korda whips the wheel in shock
spinning out of control hitting a table piled with machine parts sending them flying
but the car is now swapping ends still flying right towards roper who cant move
who wont move
the car flies past him the side mirror catching ropers shirt tearing it a flash of blood from his arm
the car then collides with a series of pipes crossing the floor steam erupting in every direction as the car then slams into several propane bottles stacked near the benches
a series of explosions ripping through the building
thrown to the floor by the explosions releasing the button as
hits the glassed in rolling doors
the car explodes from the building glass flying the car rolling flipping over coming to a rest on its wheels drivers side away from mccalls position
on the floor recovering
he catches a quick glimpse of the bottom section of the lathe a gearbox the gears turning
turning the cutting blade inching towards ronnie
staggers to his feet grabbing the control box pressing the button
nothing happens the lathe still turning sparks coming out of the box its shorting
only a few more seconds
desperately his eyes search the floor seeing a huge wrench
he grabs the wrench jamming it between the gears in the gearbox the gears shuddering violently threatening to crush the wrench
roper runs to ronnies side frantically pulling at her bonds the cutting blade now paused an inch away from her
hammering and clanking the wrench cant last a heartbeat longer
pulls the last of the restraints away
just as the massive gears crush the wrench the table turning
the blade passing directly over ronnies position as roper hauls her away holding her in his arms
korda is slumped over the wheel
he looks dead
mccall slings his rifle over his shoulder and moves towards a drain pipe attached to the side of the building
roper holding ronnie easing her away from the still turning lathe
its all over babe its all over
mccall slides to the ground via the drain pipe but
korda is not quite dead
the door eases open korda rolling to the ground bag in one hand automatic in the other
he looks up seeing mccall
he opens fire mccall hitting the deck and taking cover as bullets hit the wall around him
mccall whips out his revolver returning fire a gun battle ensuing
hearing the shots outside hauls ronnie out of the way keeping her low to the ground
stay here dont move
he pushes her towards the cover of some machines then crouching low to the floor recovers the
from the bottom of the satchel
he heads out towards the other side of the cavernous machine choked building
fires a round at korda then trying to close in on the car runs from his cover into the opening
leaps up and fires mccall taking a slug in his leg knocking him to the ground
the slide to kordas automatic has kicked open out of bullets
he drops the gun picks up the bag and runs alongside the machine shop
exits the machine shop seeing mccall on the ground korda nowhere in sight
combat style roper runs to mccall dropping to his side
mccall you all right
in pain im okay
went down the side of the building
roper sprints towards the building racing alongside it catching a glimpse of korda just as he disappears around the other end
roper charges on
korda runs past the building still clutching the bag
he runs past another building heading towards the dry dock area and ropers pickup
a moment later roper emerges from the machine shop just in time to see korda round the corner of the next building
clearing the building sees ropers pickup
he runs to it jumping inside finding the keys in the ignition
he starts the truck pulling out just as roper runs into view
with the truck accelerating towards him he raises and fires two bullet holes in the front windshield missing korda the truck still speeding towards him
ropers gun jams
roper leaps sliding forward on the hood almost falling as he grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper blades for support his weapon flying from his
speeds around the buildings and down the alleyways whipping from side to side trying to shake roper off roper hanging on for dear life
shouting give it up korda you got away with nothing
nothing but a bag of shit
its all fake
korda cant help but look at the open bag beside him
continuing go on you stupid fuck look at it
its all shit
a hundred dollars worth of glass
korda reaches in grabbing a handful of the costume jewelry
he cant believe it its all fake
korda goes crazy slamming the truck into the side of a building trying to throw roper but roper hangs on
korda then caroms off the sides of buildings left right sparks flying then smashes into boxes crates anything he can see stacked alongside the road way but roper stays put
clinging on with all hes got swinging from side to side to avoid the obstacles
then korda sees ahead a huge pile of boxes wood framing pallets trash stacked at the side of a building
he hammers the pedal driving the right side of the truck into the pile
boxes wood paper debris flying everywhere through the open fron window as well korda shielding his eyes with his arm as objects fly around in a mad flurry inside the
in the maelstrom lets go his grip grabbing the upper frame of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck rolls over the top of the cab landing
in the bed of the truck along with boxes lumber and trash
clears his eyes looking up roper is gone
he laughs hysterically
he knocked him off
leaning out the passengers side sees they are approaching the dry dock area
in the bed of the truck along with the boxes suitcases and other objects he sees several long x s
grabbing a board he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift movement stands swinging to the drivers side driving the x through the side window through the
steering wheel past the dash and catching the tip of the accelerator pedal pinning it to the floor
as roper releases the board it wedges inside the door frame locking the wheel and the accelerator the engine screaming wide open
korda reacts in panic
roper clings to the cab looking over the top the dry dock looming towards them
he prepares to jump
suddenly sees the approaching dry dock
he jams on the brakes but its not enough the truck racing towards the edge
vaults over the edge of the dry dock as roper runs down the bed leaping off the tail gate arms windmilling as he goes airborne
the truck plummets towards the bottom
lands in a huge pile of cargo nets and cardboard boxes piled near the edge of the dry dock
screams in wide eyed terror as
hits the bottom of the dock exploding into flames
roper and ronnie lay on a gorgeous white sand beach drinking from coconuts with umbrellas in them
ive never seen sea so blue
tahiti is magnificent scottie
yeah i could get used to this paradise shit
roper hails a waitress serving the hotel guests
to waitress ill have another pena colada
and this time could you shave the ice please
roper stretches back into his chaise lounge adjusting his ray bans
a purring cat without a care in the world
ive been thinking
