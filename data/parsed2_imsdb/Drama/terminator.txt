by james cameron registered wgaw fourth draft april silence
gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes audible
a low angle bounded on one side by a chain link fence and on the other by the one story public school build ings
spray can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha dows
this is a los angeles public school in a blue collar neighborhood
angle between school buildings where a trash dumpster looms in a low angle part of the clutter behind the gymnasium
a cat enters frame
camera dollies forward prowling with him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows
close on cat which freezes alert sensing something just beyond human perception
a sourceless wind rises and with it a keening whine
papers blow across the pavement
the cat yowls and hides under the dumpster
windows rattle in their frames
the whine intensifies accompanied now by a wash of frigid purple light
a concussion like a thunderclap right over head blows in all the windows facing the yard
cat its eyes are wide as the glare dies
electrical discharges arc from the dumpster to a water faucet and climb a drain pipe like a jacobs ladder
slow pan as the sound of stray electrical crackling subsides
frame comes to rest on the figure of a naked man kneeling faced away in the previously empty yard
he stands slowly
the man is in his late thirties tall and powerfully built moving with graceful precision
man his facial features reiterate the power of his body and are dominated by the eyes which are intense blue and depthless
his hair is military short
this man is the terminator
he glances down taking calm inventory of himself and notices that a fine white ash covers his skin
he brushes at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence scanning his surroundings
camera moves up as terminator approaches the schoolyard fence beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the cityscape below
the school is perched at the edge of a pro montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem ing and glistening under a sullen sky
the night clouds are shot through with occasional flashes of lightning presaging a thunderstorm
terminator stands hands on hips in prefect symmetry gazing down at the city as the camera reaches full height
a beer bottle smashes on the ground
pull back to include its ex owner and his two compatriots youth gang members lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground
they sport nondescript punk regalia
torn t shirts fatigue pants combat boots or high top sneakers leather jackets
the leader notices something and sits up
pointing hey hey
whats wrong with this picture
angle reverse seen past the lounging toughs terminator walks naked into a pool of streetlight striding purpose fully toward them
angle over terminators shoulder as he approaches them
they slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground liquid shadows
nice night for a walk eh
terminator stops right in front of them
without inflec tion nice night for a walk
they surround him all swagger and malign good humor
washday tomorrow huh
nothing clean right
terminator eyes them without expression unhurried
this guys a couple bricks short
terminator turn to the second punk ignoring the others
give them to me
the punks exchange glances dismayed
bracing fuck you asshole
without warning terminator hammer punches him in the temple with blinding speed
the blow flings him with a clang into the jungle gym
he drops to the ground in a still heap eyes open twitching
the leader whips out his switchblade and slashes in one motion
terminator ducks back and catches the knife wielders wrist in an inhuman grip
then he punches the leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone
angle pavement as the knife clatters down
the punks combat boots are on tiptoe barely touching the ground
angle two shot terminator and the leader are close together as if dancing but motionless
their bodies are in total shadow
the punks eyes are wide his veins distended with an agonizing pressure
terminator jerks his fist back with a wet sound and the other drops out of frame
the last tough is stumbling away gaping with terror
he backs into a chainlink fence turns to run along it finds he is in a corner
terminator takes a step toward him his gaze ominous
the punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes
thunder peals overhead
a light rain begins to fall
terminator emerges onto the street from the playground pausing in the pool of light under a streetlight to hike the collar of the punks jacket
the rain streams down over his face running into and over his eyes
they do not blink
another part of the city
seedy apartments and storefronts
the streets glisten hissing with sporadic late night traffic
slow pan and dolly into the mouth of a narrow alley lined with trash containers and fire escapes
from a recessed doorway two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement
an angry inarticulate drunkards monologue rises occasionally above the rain sounds
angle doorway the derelict rouses from his bitter stupor as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork around him
a shockwave hurls trash into the air
painted over windows shatter
rat scurry blinded
a figure drops into frame as if out of the sky and smacks the pavement with a muddy splash
derelict as he blinks at the fading glare amazed
a naked man compact and muscular rises in a defensive crouch
kyle reese is but his face has been aged by ordeal the mouth hard eyes grim
a crinkled burn scar traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead
other scars from burns and bullets mar his hard muscled body
the rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin as electrical arcs lace back and forth between the fire escapes behind him hissing and sputtering
the sound fades then stops altogether to be replaced by a rising scream of animal agony
reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley
camera moves with reese as he leaps to the fire escape and clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another naked man who appears to be entangled in
the man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering gasp
closer angle reveals that he has been skewered through the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the shoulder by a railing
he has materialized in the same space occupied by the fire escape structure
the figure slumps motionless
reese quickly checks for signs of life
the man is dead
reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk huddled in the doorway
a pair of flamboyantly dressed women obviously working girls passes by the alley mouth
they do a double take when they see reese but walk on without breaking stride completely jaded
hes certainly not a potential customer
reese crouches down as if to speak to the drunk
did you see a real bright light
a brilliant white glare stabs into the alley mouth as an lapd cruiser glides slowly by on the street
the search light illuminates the figure of reese crouching over the sprawled drunk just pulling on the others trousers
the cruiser chirps to a stop
the doors fly open and two cops leap out
hold it right there
reese hitches his pants and bolt like a shot
the cops draw their guns and race into the alley after him
handheld camera or panaglide rushing with reese along the narrow alley
he vaults a pile of tumbled trashcans
whips around a corner
leaps the hood of a parked car in the cross alley
panaglide preceding cops as they snake through the night maze
panaglide with reese as he hits a chain link gate at a dead run and scrambles over it
whip pan on cops skidding to a stop at the corner in time to see reese vault the fence
dolly with second cop as he runs to the gate
low panaglide with reese running full tilt displaying incredible agility
reeses pov the alley walls blur by
the view of a hot wired rat in an urban maze
reese camera hugging him as he sprints and turns alternately front lit side lit and silhouetted as the electric glare of the city wheels about him
angle alley mouth reese flashes though intermittent cross lighting in the b
another unit arrives out front and reese melts back into the alley only to see a cop round the corner behind him
reese crashes into a steel door rending the lock and vanishes into the darkness within
the newly arrived cops are a k unit
they open the back door of the squad car to release a large black doberman
reese finds himself among the display racks of a discount department store
a searchlight stabs in the front window as he dashes into the maze of aisles
three cops enter behind him through the shattered door
fast panaglide with reese as he crab runs low among the moving shadows where flashlights quarter the darkness
he bolts the open space behind a display window
sees the outside searchlight sweep toward him
angle reese his feral face frozen among the smooth featured smiling mannequins
as the light passes reese silently moves on
angle cop passing the end of a long aisle b
while in the f
a hand enters frame removing a knit shirt from a hanger
reese slips the shirt on quietly and does a fast crab walk across the aisles to melt into the other racks and shadows camera moving low with him
with a shocking growl the police dog hurtles out of the shadows leaping right at camera
angle reese and dog a dark blur with teeth extremely doberman flies toward reese
catches it by the throat in mid air
arcs it to the floor with unflinching precision
doberman suddenly on its back and held by the throat the dog yelps and stares at reese who leans very close
inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis ing dominance
some ancient communication seems to pass between the two
reese releases the animal and turns his back on it selecting a long overcoat from a rack
the dog backs away from him stiff legged and confused
tracking with reese as he rounds a corner on the run still shrugging into his long coat
running smack at him is another cop gun aimed
without slowing reese leaps toward him twisting in mid air like a cat
the cop fires
goes down under reeses tackle and they slide together on the polished floor
before they even come to rest reese snatches the cops gun aiming it at the others face two handed
what day is it
viciously what year
a shot whines off the metal side of an escalator behind reeses head
he vaults the escalator rail leaving the amazed cop lying on the floor
reese bounds up the frozen steps pocketing the
police special in his coat
cops dash through the maze of aisles converging at the escalators
whip panning with reese as he hurtles between displays
he stops for a moment beside a rack of shoes
slaps one of a pair of tennis shoes sole to sole against his bare foot
holding the shoes he runs on
a door opens quietly and reese slips out
camera tracks with him as he moves like a panther along the narrow catwalk
tilt down to include the first lapd cruiser parked at the mouth of the alley
reese drops cat like beside the unattended police car
cautiously he opens the door of the cruiser removes the riot gun an ithaca pump model from the dash rack and slips it under his coat
cradled in a vertical position the shortened weapon is virtually invisible
he walks out onto the street and away unhurriedly an innocuous pedestrian soon lost in the rain
reese enters a telephone booth
harsh light rakes across his face outlining the long scar
he opens the directory leafs through it
angle macro on page reeses finger slides down a column
stops beside the following listings in the big metropolitan white pages the nights rain has given way to a typical l
morning of diffuse sunlight
moving with a girl on a moped as she zips through traffic
sarah conner is small and delicate featured
pretty in a flawed accessible way
she doesnt stop the party when she walks in but youd like to get to know her
her vulner able quality masks a strength even she doesnt know exists
sarah maneuvers nimbly apparently in a hurry
sarah buzzes into the parking lot of big bobs family restaurant and chains the moped to the icon of big bob himself
the fiberglass cherub holds up his mammoth hamburger in perpetual homage to whatever deity watches out for fat kids
sarah removes a stack of college textbooks from the luggage carrier and tuns to go into the restaurant
to big bob watch this for me big buns
high wide shot prominently featuring a video surveillance camera f
as sarah enters below
she passes under another video eye as she crosses the main floor of the wholesomely appointed eatery
sarah goes through the swinging staff doors under a third camera
the office is closet like lit by the glow of several security monitors
chuck breen day manager pimply and officious watches sarah in an overhead view of the service corridor
he punches a switch and reaches for a microphone on a studio gooseneck
sarah glances up as breens voice rasps from a ceiling speaker
she answers the empty hallway
come to the office please
she turns back toward the office door at the end of the corridor
sarah opens the door to breens closet control center
mission control to chuck come in
without looking up youre late
sarah is undaunted
arent i worth waiting for
do you think you can get here on time if i put you on the floor as a waitress
grinning i dont know
i kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life
the pays the same but youll make more in tips
i need the money
can i still work the hours around my classes
breen turns to punch up a display on the restaurants small accounting computer
sarah looks over his shoulder as he modifies the weeks schedule
same schedules okay
gravely can you handle it
its not brain surgery chuck
breen hands her an apron ceremoniously
here you go
youre a bobs girl now
nancy will check you out
i wont let the fat kid down
angle tight on locker door as it slams shut revealing sarah transformed into a bobs girl
her hair is in a bun
short flared skirt and apron with a bow
she resembles a suburbanized peasant maid looking for a goat to milk
sarah confronts her reflection in the mirror pondering its absurdity
she pinches her sheeks
hi im sarah and ill be you waitress
pause im so wholesome i could puke
tight on car side window as a figure approaches reflected in the glass
a fist punches through the window shattering it
the thief unlocks the door and gets behind the wheel
with a blow from the heel of his hand terminator smashes loose the ignition assembly and strips the wires with a brutal twist of his fingers
touching the proper wires he starts the car
terminator walks past the long display window of an enormous pawnshop emporium
signs declare among other things guns and ammo is red block letters
terminator passes the appliance section and the pictures on a row of tv sets distort and break up sequentially as he walks by returning to normal behind him
he enters the store
tight on glass countertop as an ar assault rifle with scope is laid beside a number of other guns a colt k model
acp a smith and wesson
four inch a beretta the remington autoloader
wide as the clerk who looks like a sick lizard pallid and paunchy takes the rifle from a wall rack
he lays it beside the arsenal of perfectly legal anti human artillery already on the glass counter
terminator scans expressionlessly for additional selec tions
a phased plasma pulse laser in the forty watt range
annoyed just what you see pal
he indicates the display case and wall racks with a minimal gesture
the uzi millimeter
setting it out you know your weapons buddy
terminator examines each in turn working the actions with curt precise movements
continuing any one of thems ideal for home defense
whichll it be
the clerk digs deep and finds a scrap of a smile
maybe ill close early
cash or charge
instead of replying terminator takes a box of shotgun shells from a stack on the display case
sorry i cant sell the ammo with the guns
youll have to hey
terminator has calmly begun feeding the shells into the shotgun
continuing you cant to that
he raises the barrel and pulls the trigger
the gun thunders
the yellow maverick pulls to a stop beside a single phone booth
moving with terminator as he gets out walks to the booth and rapidly pulls its occupant out by his greasy t shirt flinging him backward into the parking lot
the guy is bear like slab handed but terminator doesnt even glance back as he steps in to take the mans place
outraged hey man
a womans voice a faint reedy monologue issues from the dangling receiver
terminator leafs rapidly through the directory
angle macro shot as terminators finger comes to rest beside a now familiar listing sarah is bustling about trying to service the start of the dinner rush
in waitress parlance shes in it
she runs the gauntlet between tables precariously balancing two full dinner plates on one arm and hand carrying a third
a customer tugs on her apron for attention and she barely averts contributing the chili size to his wardrobe
honey can i get that coffee now
yes sir just a second
she reaches her table after near collisions with a mexican busboy and two teenage girls doing cheerleading routines in lock step
who gets the burly burger
i ordered barbecue beef
does mine come with fires
hes got the barbecue beef ive got a chili beef deluxe
okay who gets the burly beef
miss were ready to order
in the process of setting down all the plates sarah knocks over someones water glass
mopping fran tically oh sorry
thats not real leather is it
as she cleans up the spill a kid at the next booth reaches over and dumps a scoop of ice cream into the top pouch of sarahs apron she stares
down at the mess melting over her hard earned and sags with defeat
nancy a plump gum chewing waitress stops beside her to whisper
look at it this way in a hundred years whos gonna care
angle on a standard issue l
suburban street with kids racing big wheels b
low angle with the frame comprising a single house toy littered lawn and mailbox
by the curb is a childs plastic truck
there is the sound of a car engine approaching and the front of the yellow maverick appears stopping at the curb
its front tire crushes the toy
panaglide on terminator preceding him as he steps out of the car pauses by the mailbox to check the name and strides toward the house
a young boy playing in the driveway watches him pass
the boys dog a small terrier growls low and mean crouching back from terminator
he rings the doorbell and waits motionless
the door opens a few inches held by a security chain revealing a frail middle aged woman in apron and rubber cleaning gloves
no shes upstairs
who shall i say is terminator breaks the chain and pushes past her as if she didnt exist
panaglide on terminator preceding his as he crosses the foyer and mounts the stairs
the woman starts after him
what do you think youre my god
she gasps and stops in her tracks as terminator smoothly pulls the
from under his jacket and snaps the cocking slide
screeching oh my god
installed on her bed for an afternoon of soaps is the wrong sarah connor
electrode pads exercise her doughy thighs as the year old divorcee watches general hospital
she calls out distractedly what is it mom
she jumps as the door bangs open
and stares in dumb amazement as the good looking intense eyed man in the strange clothes raises a pistol
and aims it at her face
it all seems less real than general hospital in that half second before he fires
the mother is fumbling with a telephone when she hears the shot
the silence stretches for several beats
then five more shots are heard
the woman screams and drops the phone as she stares upward
angle on ceiling above her
with each successive shot a chuck of plaster explodes off the ceiling
low angle on terminator standing with the
aimed down at the dead woman just out of frame on the floor
he unhurriedly removes the spent clip reloads the weapon and replaces it under his jacket
crouching down he turns the womans body over confirming that she is dead
the mother is frantically dialing the phone
she mis dials starts over
then stops as she hears the bedroom door open
terminator stands at the head of the stairs
his hand is bloody where he grasped the dead womans shoulder
he starts down the stairs
the mother stands paralyzed unable to breathe
he reaches the main floor and walks toward her
she edges into a corner eyes wide
he reaches out
and wipes his hands clean on her apron
terminator walks out without expression leaving the woman to sag to the floor in a faint
tight on kyle reeses hands as they make the last few strokes with a hacksaw to sever the wooden stock from the riot gun
it clatters to the ground leaving a short stump like a pistol grip
cut wider as reese hefts the weapon
he is crouched in an underground service tunnel below a busy street
shadows of people walking across a grating in the sidewalk above him flicker past
they cant see him in the darkness below their feet as he checks the guns action carefully
he slips it under his overcoat where it hangs from a jerry rigged sling
reese emerges from a stairwell behind a service station his overcoat done up to the top button
he walks through the sparse morning crowd on the cluttered overbuilt commercial street
he is out of sync
a stranger in a strange land
he holds himself tightly reined cautious and feral as he moves among the unconcerned pedestrians
his eyes flick rapidly about
he is seeing this babylon for the first time
reese stops at a hole in the wall take out stand
he watches people walk away with food
scrutinizes the next man as he orders
gimme a falafel with yogurt dressing and uh baco bits
the counterman hands him his food and change wordlessly as reese steps up
gimme a falafel with uh yogurt and baco bits
the counterman barely looks up as he passes the mess through the window
thatll be one sixty
he glances up and reese is gone
he leans half out the window
son of a bitch
reese crouches in an alley out of sight of passersby wolfing his food
the sauce runs down his sleeve but he doesnt notice
an old man with a shrunken ungenerous face scowls at the menu as sarah wipes the tabletop in front of him
i havent seen you in here lately mr
whats it to ya
you must have a girlfriend
thats none of your business
is she young
miller lowers his menu and glares at her
compared to me she is
how come youre not at the cash anymore
they catch ya steal ing
smiling whats it to ya
when she leaves the old man is grinning behind the menu where no one can see him
sarah rounds the corner walking fast as she undoes her apron
she calls out to the walls without looking up
im on break chuck
carlas got my station
as she approaches the locker room where the girls take their coffee breaks the door bursts open and nancy beckons to sarah
excitedly hurry up
its about you
i mean sort of
nancy guides sarah to the small black and white portable tv in the corner
two other girls smoking cigarettes with their shoes off and nyloned feet on the table are already watching
one glances at sarah
this is weird
they huddle around the set intent on a newscast in progress
and a police spokesman at the scene refused to speculate on a motive for the execution style slaying of the encino housewife
he did however say that an accurate description of the suspect has been compiled from several witnesses
once again sarah connor thirty five mother of two brutally shot to death in her home this afternoon
as the news grinds on sarah gazes unseeingly at the screen
nancy claps her on the shoulder laughing
youre dead honey
sunlight is dying when sarah swings her moped to the curb in front of the good life spa a large crowded health club
music booms and masses of leotarded cellulite sway in close f
as camera dollies along a row of panting stretching women
in deep b
sarah slips in through the door and waits against the wall while the human dynamo ginger ventura leads the class energetically
ginger sarahs roommate is a party stopper
red haired athletic sensuous
shes pretty enough when still but stunning in motion
and shes in motion
ginger yells commands and cheerfully dives into contortions to the beat of a motown favorite
marco a handsome well defined guy wearing a tight staff t shirt strolls up for a drink at the water fountain next to sarah
ive seen you around
cute i remember
the dance tape ends
and three aaand four
and thats it ladies
now didnt that feel good
the group collapses ensemble
a chorus of groans
lets think positive or next time ill play the fm version
ginger walks over to sarah as the class disperses
marco is leaning on the wall next to sarah who is enjoying the attention
say some thing in italian
before marco can reply ginger pulls the front of his gym shorts out and peers down
she shakes her head
youre wasting your time kiddo
she grabs sarah by the arm and pulls her out the door
sarah catches a glimpse of marcos expression over her shoulder as the door closes
panaglide with the two girls as they descend to the first floor and enter a hallway sarah is gasping with laughter
weakly i dont believe you did that
ginger is adjusting her ever present walkman type cassette player at her hip
she slips on the earphones as they walk along
sarah feigns outrage
continuing i had him hooked
he was just about to ask me out
i could tell
that guys a jerk
i did you a favor
ill do the same for you sometime
sarah laughs and claps her friend on the back
they turn in at a door marked weight room
several angles on glistening arms legs torsos merging into bio mechanical kinetic sculptures with the chrome steel levers and tubes
the crash and squeal of metal against metal
two conan esque arms thrust upward glistening
gingers boyfriend matt mccallister the assistant manager of the club strains out his last reps bench pressing enormous weight on the nautilus machine
despite his imposing appearance matt is one of the warmest people youd ever want to meet
his face is contorted muscles knotted for the last push
he heaves it up with a guttural cry
lowering his weights with a clang matt lies panting arms dangling at his side eyes closed
a pair of female legs appear
matt opens his eyes
continuing you think somebodys gonna do this for you
look at those shriveled bis
and you havent worked lats or abs since wednesday
smiling hello sweetheart
had a rough day
softening come here wimp
she leans down as he sits up and they meet in a kiss thats bad for the other guys discipline
sarah waits until they break the clinch to speak
matt look backwards over the bench and replies upside down
grinning broadly heeey
its my favorite sarah
ginger pulls the pin on mats weights and re inserts it beneath the entire stack the maximum weight
alright warm ups are over
back to work bunky
ginger readadjusts her headphones as the two girls walk away
you too ginger
two weightlifters nearby look at each other than at matt
sarah lurches away from the curb on her moped almost spilling ginger who is attempting to ride double
they swing out onto a main thoroughfare and careen through the bumper to bumper traffic
sarah maneuvers deftly though overloaded and unstable
ginger doesnt know whether to laugh of scream at the near misses
she does both
on a side street the girls pass an excavation site between high rises
they pass out of frame as camera holds on the construction area and gingers shrieks fade
in the f
under an overpass reese sits is a car watching the powerful machines moving earth
hes in a late model non descript grey sedan one of a row of cars gathering dirt beside the construction site
crab armed back hoes and massive caterpillars roar through a curtain of dust under intense floodlights
a power shovel moves its great arm lighting its own way with an arc light
reese sits motionless in the dark
the clock in the dash ticks quietly
he flips on the radio
a fatuous pop rock station
reese fishes a magazine off the dirty floor
his over coat is off draped over the shotgun on the seat beside him
his bare arms are sinewy and scarred
reese flips the page of cosmopolitan
he look at the glossy photos the glossy women
svelte and seamless
the ads fascinate him too caribbean vacations and blended whiskeys
his head sags against the door
he gazes dully at the tracks of a passing caterpillar as they chew through the dirt
the road and clatter of treads intensifies as his eyes close
tight on a gleaming steel tread as it grinds through debris
the debris is ferroconcrete girders and jackstraw heaps of human bones burned black
there is the sound of explosions distant and an intermittent electronic whine
incredibly bright searchlights play over the ground
panning with the moving treads through twisted wreckage f
the screen whites out with a blast very close
as the debris clatters down a helmetted head snaps up into frame the visor of the high tech helmet is shattered presumably by the explosion
the wearer rips it off revealing a younger reese minus his burn scar
his face is bathed in sweat lit by the glow from a crt scope sight on a strange looking rifle
the sound of screams and hoarse shouts not far off and a continuous low murmuring of radio chatter grid coordinates casualties unit placements medic requests
reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate a girl of about sixteen gaunt dirty heavily armed like himself
dollying as they start to belly crawl through the bones and wreckage
reese looks up
through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying sphinx like shape moves against the sky
obscured by dust and blinding sweeps of its searchlights
though we see little this is an h k hunter killer mobile ground unit
reese crawls pacing the h k under and through on elbows and knees past mounds of charred skulls
they pass the body of a child a boy of about center punched with a smoking hole
the boy clutches a rifle
some in rags some in uniforms like theirs
theyre all dirty and gaunt scabrous
and still bleeding
reese scrabbles past a dark rat hole and there are human rats in it
some of them are sobbing or screaming
the glare lights the huddled few
human vermin with mud caked weapons that havent been invented yet
soldiers in a nightmare war
reese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall having outflanked the massive h k
its flashing blue lights flick across the walls its searchlights sear through the debris
wider showing the h k more clearly
a blast scarred chrome leviathon with hydraulic arms folded mantis like against its torso and huge underslung gun turrets
reese leaps up and straight arms a satchel charge into its path
one tread rolls over the explosive
guns and searchlights swivel
the head turns ponderously
reeses partner rises poised to throw hers
a power bolt catches her at the top of her arc blowing reese is knocked down by the concussion
gets up running as the charges blow
the h ks tread carriers are ripped apart
it lurches to a stop burning
the following sequence is extremely foreshortened
explosions light the ruins like flashbulbs
energy weapons criss cross the night like tracers
low angle up past the burning h k as its flying counter part an aerial h k arcs into view with a turbojet whine
reese hauls two survivors of his unit into a personnel carrier a chevy camaro with steel plate welded over it and the roof cut away to access the caliber machine
its stripped and rusted and bullet riddled glassless
the tires are off road and very gnarly
theyre driving through the ruins up and over and through
reese drives like a demon
under other circumstances it would be considered insane
here it is merely very good
the machine gun chatters
a black shape descends a demon with searchlights
reeses car flips like a kicked beer can rolling and crumpling
hes pinned in the wreck bloody screaming despite his training
the only other survivor an emaciated boy of twelve is pulling for all hes worth to drag reese out before it burns
close on a boy about twelve clean and healthy wearing a blue plastic dodgers helmet
he reaches through the window of the sedan
reeses eyes open in a split second and suddenly there is a shotgun muzzle aimed right at us
reese quivers with a curious spasm similar to the tremors of his arrival and blinks at the boy
the boy is white faced staring down the bore
he backs away
we see that he is straddling a bicycle
the boys sister slightly younger and also on a bicycle cant see the shotgun from where shes waiting
taunting see i told you he wasnt dead
you owe me baskin robbins
the boy rides past her list a shot
urgently come on
just come on
reese relaxes slowly the voltage draining out of him
insert macro reeses finger on the trigger is white with pressure
he slips the safety to the off position
the gun can now be fired
he sets it on the seat and reaches for the dangling ignition wires starting the car
lit by streetlights the car moves away with it lights off and vanishes in the shadows
sarah and ginger are crammed into the tiny bathroom becoming inextricably tangled in each others cords as they blow dry curl hair and apply make up
ginger has her headphones inverted under her chin but in place and is bouncing to music as she dries her hair
she is wearing a short terry cloth bathrobe that reveals the greater part of her legs
sarah is in a skirt and bra
the phone rings and sarah goes out into the living room to get it
answering the phone hello
on phone deep and breathy first im going to rip the buttons off your blouse one by one
then run my tongue along your neck down to your bare gleaming breasts
sarah cups her hand over the mouthpiece and calls out matter of factly ginger
she resumes listening
and then slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch and lick your belly in circles further and further down
then ill pull off your panties with my teeth
sarah is repressing laughter
crossly who is this
then matt realizes to his horror who hes been talking to
oh my god
jesus im sorry
i thought you were
can i talk to ginger
as ginger approaches sarah hands her the receiver and goes into the bedroom
first im gonna rip the buttons off your blouse
sarah picks up four blouses on hanger lying on the bed and goes back into the hallway
ginger is still listening to matt nodding as sarah enters and starts holding the blouses against herself one by one for gingers inspection
what do you think
covering mouth piece great
sarah hold up another one
how about this
youre a big help
advisory tone alright the beige one
i hate the beige one
same advisory tone dont wear the beige one
sarah gathers up the blouses and walks out
this guys probably a schmuck and i dont care what i wear
a couple of beats and shes back in the doorway with a concerned expression
continuing you think the beige
an unmarked car with a clamp on light and siren blaring screeches to the curb behind two marked black and whites in front of a funky venice apartment building
a small crowd is gathered around the front steps
lieutenant ed vukovich homicide division gets out of the car and strides through the crowd
hes fiftyish short but square and solid a human bulldog gone a little to paunch
he chews juicy fruit gum like a maniac a chain chewer
hes homely as an old boot
and hes not a smart cop hes a wise one rarer still
the onlookers gathered patiently for their ten second glimpse of something under a sheet separate for him to pass
camera panaglides ahead of vukovich as he climbs the switch back staircase two steps at a time
he passes two uniformed cops at the doorway of a second floor apartment and enters to find a quiet flurry of activity
several detectives and a photographer prowl around taking evidence taking pictures
in the center of the living room floor is the body of a young woman crumpled face down in a small lake of blood
two bags of groceries lie split open on the floor in front of her
vukovich glances up as he is joined by detective sgt
traxler is black lean and very jaded
give me the short version
six shots at less than ten feet
weapon was a large caliber vukovich is looking at the body
traxler turns to a passing detective
dont track it all over
its un professional
he turn back to vukovich gesturing at the body
continuing okay lets see
got a pos itive on her
shes sarah connor works as a legal interrupting that cant be right
thats the name of the one valley division mopped up this after noon
traxler slips something off his clipboard and hands it to the lieutenant
heres her drivers license
pondering you gotta be kidding me
the new guysll be short stroking it over this one
a one day pattern killer
i hate the weird ones
sarah poses with ginger in front of the mirror
they are dressed made up hair styled and ready
studying their reflection better than mortal man deserves
sarah grins and goes into the other room
sarah walks around the room searching for something
calling ginger have you seen pugsley
ginger enters stopping beside their phone answering machine
did you check messages
still looking i thought you did
she checks under the couch then behind the drapes
she bends down
from beside cur tains come here young man
mind your mother
pugsley as the green iguana cocks its head blinking vapidly
resume wide sarah lifts the three foot long lizard from his perch on the windowsill
she gives the complacent reptile a kiss on its blunt snout
groaning totally nauseating
sarah drapes the lizard across her shoulders where it sits contentedly as she looks for her purse
ginger has been rewinding the message tape
she punches play and a male voice is heard
recorded hi sarah
uh somethings come up and it looks like i wont be able to make it tonight
im really sorry
call you in a day or so
sarah stands still crestfallen
so what if he has a porsche he cant treat you like that
its friday night for crissakes
slumping ill live
ill break his kneecaps
sarah resignedly slips pugsley off her shoulders
you still love me dont you pugsley
she places pugsley in a large terrarium with a beware of dog sign taped on the side
continuing im going to a movie kiddo
you and matt have a good time
as sarah exits we will kiddo
sarah is a small figure in the shadowed echoing garage of her building
converging dolly pacing her as she passes the stalls with their inky shadows
the light near her moped is out
she fumbles in the dark to unlock the chain
she looks up
did she hear something
masked by the rattle of the chain
pov sarah there is no movement for the length of the garage
on sarah c
she stows the chain and starts the bike
it whines reassuringly
sarah jumps on and whirs out of the garage
sarah is visible through the windshield as she pulls onto the street
pan with her to reveal kyle reese hunched down in shadow watching
he puts the car in gear and pulls out to follow her receding tail light
streetlights flash across his face in stark lines profile
mouth cruel where the scar tugs at it
dollying with vukovich and traxler as they pass through a group of reporters
mostly newspaper stringers but there is also one bored local tv minicam crew
lieutenant are you aware that these two killings occurred in the same order as their listings in the phone book
he and traxler enter their office and shut the door
vukovich drops his gun in the wastebasket picks up a cup of coffee from his desk and uses it to wash down a handful of aspirins
that stuffs two hours cold
nodding ab sently i know
eyeing him i put a cigarette out in it
vukovich lost in thought turns on him suddenly
did you reach the next girl yet
keep getting an answer ing machine
send a unit
i already did
no answer at the door and the apartment managers out
im keeping them there
i just called
call her again
traxler picks up the phone and begins to dial her number as vukovich sets down his coffee cup unwraps a stick of gum and pops it in his mouth
continuing got a cigarette
close on phone connected to the answering machine
the outgoing message trigger after the second ring
long pause ha ha ha fooled you
youre talking to a machine but dont by shy its okay
machines need love too so talk to it and ginger thats me or sarah will get back to you
wait for the beep
as the message plays camera dollies off the phone machine and down the corridor of the dark apartment
as the bedroom door draws near gingers recorded voice fades and is super ceded by cries and moans
full shot framed against the streetlit curtains ginger and matt from a beautiful tableau of lovemaking in silhouette
their perfect bodies glisten with backlight as they strain in passion
closer tight two revealing that ginger is wearing her earphones
matt without breaking rhythm reaches out to the night table and thumbs the volume higher
ginger cries out louder apparently enjoying his sure touch on her volume control
traxler hangs up the phone
i can hear it now its gonna be the goddamned phone book killer
i hate the press cases
especially the weird press cases
where you going
heading for the door to make a statement
im gonna give them the name
maybe the jackals can help us out for once
he looks at his watch then straightens his tie
continuing if they can get this on the tube by eleven she may just call us
pause how do i look
like shit boss
vukovich goes out and the minicam light hits him as the door closes
tight on a tv screen a news cast in progress
police had no further comment on the apparent similarity between the shooting death of an encino woman earlier today
cut wide to show sarah watching the tv which is suspended over the bar
the place is a crowded post movie hangout raucous with laughter and videogames
the newscast continues ignored by all except sarah
continuing and this almost identical killing two hours ago of a venice resident with virtually the same name
sarah ann connor a year old legal secretary was pronounced dead at the scene in her beachfront apartment
a customer gestures for the bartenders attention
hey can we change this and catch the ball scores
reaching for the knob sure
sarah leaps half over the bar startling everyone
shouting leave it where it is
no other connections between the two victims has been estab lished
pause on a lighter note these was cause for celebration at the l
zoo today as
sarah leaves her half finished pizza and beer getting up in a daze
followed by puzzles glances she makes her way through the crowd
in the crowded hallway by the restrooms sarah goes to the single payphone and seizes the directory
she flips rapidly through it then stops looking down
she sees that her name is next on the list
the book slips out of her fingers
sarah turns and scans the crowd
shes getting looks covert and otherwise like any unaccom panied girl on a friday night
but is that all they mean
sarah back into the womens restroom
sarah stumbles numbly to the sink
she splashes her face with cold water
in the mirror her terrified reflection looks back
she hears a loud clatter and spins around
its just a drunken woman fumbling with a toilet stall door
sarah edges back out into the corridor
sarah walks stiffly to the pay phone
its out of order
sarah exits the pizza place into the sparse crowd on the sidewalk
as she passes a figure leaning against the wall just outside the man turns his head to watch her
it is reese his gaze impassive
streetlight catches the burn scar on his cheek
he is motionless sinister in his long coat
she walks on
pov sarah on crowd moving toward and through approaching groups of pedestrians
they seem to be glancing at her
was it always like that and she just never noticed
sarah as she look over her shoulder
pov sarah on pizza parlor doorway
reese is gone
she resists the urge to run
on the opposite side of the street an lapd cruiser glides slowly by
sarah is about to call out but a bus blocks her view and when it had passed the car is turning away down a side street
she passes a large window with stokers written on it and ducks quickly through the door
angle through window sarah f
as reese approaches
her knuckles clench white as he reaches the entrance and walks by unhurriedly without a glance inside
she turns and scan the gloomy interior which reveals itself to be less than savory
pool tables and upper middle lowlife in submarine depths of smoky haze
sarah draws stares menacing in their own right as she weaves between the pool tables to the back of the bar
her hands are trembling as she drops a dime in the pay phone and dials
you have reached the los angeles police department emergency number
all lines are busy
if you need a police car sent out to you please stay on the line
sarah holds the receiver pressed to her ear glancing around fear feeding on frustration
an lapd black and white sits at the curb in front of sarahs building with two cops inside drinking coffee
through the open window we hear the dispatchers voice on the radio
two eleven in progress at seven eleven market third and tamarac
one suspect believed to be armed
the car pulls out with lights and siren on
a moment later terminator rounds the corner of the building and climbs the stairs to the entryway
he surveys the bank of call buttons then turns to consider the barred security gate
panaglide with ginger as she ties her terry cloth robe and leaving matt in a dead sleep pads through the dark apartment
down the hall past the phone with traxlers message
through the dark living room
she has her walkman in the pocket of her robe and bops to herself in the silent gloom as she enters the kitchen
when she opens the refrigerator to remove snack fixings the light briefly illuminates the kitchen and in that moment something moves in the f
tight on ginger moving with her as she backs toward the counter with her arms full of snack stuff
a sudden crash
a flurry of motion behind her
she spins dropping half her load
ginger fumbles for the lightswitch
revealing pugsley sitting there blinking innocently among overturned spice bottles on the counter top
ill make a belt out of you
pugsley disappears into a large fern by the window and ginger sets about her task slathering crunchy peanut butter on stalks of celery
medium on matt as rustling curtains play patterns of street light over his sleeping face
the sound of a faint breeze
in the b
is the balcony empty
the sliding door is open
tight on matt as his eyes open at the sound of a quiet repeated clicking
up angle past matt as the five inch blade of an industrial razor knife reaches full extension in terminators hand right above him
it slashes viciously downward
matt rolls and the pillow is slit open where his throat had been
terminator catches him by the hair and slashed down again
matt grabs the wrist in both hands
the enormous muscles of his arms which seem capable of bench pressing a chrysler strain and knot against the pressure of the killers single arm
and still the blade moves closer to his throat
with a final heave matt deflects the down pressure sideways and the blade snaps with a clink against the headboard
handheld with matt as he rolls off the bed spins and slams his fists together into terminators temple
he picks up a brass deco lamp and brings it down with piledriver force
unperturbed terminator knocks the lamp away and hurls matt over the bed
matt crashes through the glass doors and slams against the balcony railing
oblivious to the noise ginger croons in rock and roll ecstasy singing to a celery stalk as if it were a micro phone
matt heaves himself up powerful body gleaming with sweat and hurls himself upon the intruder
the titans crash into a dresser reducing it to kindling
then into the closet door exploding the full length mirror
terminator places one hand on either side of matts barrel chest
sinks his fingers into the flesh
an inhuman grip
matt is raised off the floor contorted with agony above the others head
dolly preceding ginger as she returns from the kitchen with a plate full of celery stalks and a glass of milk
camera passes the closed bedroom door and stops as ginger pauses to set the plate on top of the glass freeing one hand to open the door
an explosion of splinters in close f
as a shape smashes through the door right in front of her
matts body propelled halfway through the door by enormous force
ginger shrieks and leaps back flinging milk and all into the air
the door begins to open the pressure of matts body creates resistance
ginger screams and back away
the door is wrenched open and terminator steps through with the massive
handheld with ginger the walls blur by as she runs
tight on terminator as the pistol rises into frame aligning with his eyes
low fast dolly with ginger as the bullet punches into her shoulder pitching her on her face outside the bathroom door
low wide angle as she crawls forward gasping drowning
the implacable figure looms behind her
her expression is agony and reeling nauseating terror
and incomprehension why am i suddenly dying
her eyes roll showing the whites like a horse tethered in a burning stable
ginger scrabbles pathetically for a grip on the tile floor as she pulls herself into the bathroom
she clutches the rim of the toilet
low angle past her on terminator as he stands behind her
pan up off her
he takes aim
and empties the clip
he calmly reloads
close on phone machine as the telephone rings loudly in the ensuing silence
terminator spins drawing an instantaneous bead on the source of the sound but doesnt fire
recorded hi there
pause ha ha ha fooled you
youre talking to a machine
terminator motionless listening
recorded continuing but dont be shy its okay
machines need love too
terminator turns abruptly back to gingers body
he turns it over assuring himself that she is dead
continuing recorded so talk to it and ginger thats me or sarah will get back to you
wait for the beep
there is a loud tone and the incoming call is heard
on machine ginger this is sarah
terminators head snaps back and he freezes listening
he rises slowly as sarahs voice continues
on machine contin uing im in this sleazy bar called stokers on pico but im too scared to leave
im really scared kiddo
sarah cups the telephones mouthpiece with her hand and glances around frequently
continuing into phone i think somebodys after me and i sure hope you play this soon cause i need you and matt to come pick me up
the police keep transferring me around but im going to try them again
the number here is
call me kiddo
i need you
its stokers on pico
terminator is rapidly and methodically rifling the contents of sarahs small desk
sirens wail approaching
he picks up a small card
it is sarahs college i
card complete with color photo of her
terminators eyes as he tosses the card down after a fraction of a seconds scan
picks up something else
tight on sarahs address book terminator pockets this and slips out the balcony door
climbing over the railing he is gone
sarah is huddled back to the wall beside the phone
on phone upset look lieutenant
uh vukovich dont put me on hold and dont transfer me to another department
on phone i wont
now just relax
where are you
pause yeah i know it
are you alright
on phone yes but i dont want to leave
i think this guys following me
on phone alright ms
youre in a public place youll be safe til we get there
dont go outside or in the restroom
ill be there in a few minutes
he hangs up and grabs his coat motioning to traxler
sarah takes a seat at a booth near the bar and picks up a dog eared menu but cant concentrate on it
she looks at her watch and glances around
the yellow maverick hurtles along an empty street
closer angle as streetlight glare slashes across terminators face in flaring pulses
vukovich draws his colt python
magnum and check the load
traxler is driving
lets see how this guy likes playing hard ball
the waitress set a cup of coffee in front of sarah
sarah shakes her head no and contemplates her trembling hands
she half turns catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror behind the bar
tight on sarah reflected in the mirror
in the f
a man at the bar looks up from his beer straight into her eyes
it is reese
he gazes at her coolly for a moment then glances away
sarah feeling trapped frantic
angle on front door as it opens and a figure stands silhou etted briefly against a streetlight
reese turns his eyes flickering to the mirror the figure
reese as he mechanically raises his beer
his knuckles are white
he slowly undoes the top button of his overcoat
there is a glint of metal in the shadows within
reese turns slowly on his barstool as the figure brushes past him out of focus f
sarah looks up
reeses hand sliding slowly along polished steel a caress
his finger slips through the triggerguard of the riot gun
medium on sarah as the man stops in front of her in close f
he sits slowly in the booth opposite her
the angle is over uncertainly lieutenant vukovich
reverse angle it is not lt
terminator sits motionless for a beat
blue eyes so pure and deep
the eyes of a saint perhaps
is out and cocked and aimed directly at camera almost in one motion
the bore seems enormous
back on sarah over the gun barrel her eyes go wide
we hold a beat like a frozen slice of nightmare
medium on reese as he whips the riot gun to a hip firing posi tion his overcoat falling back with a snap
on terminator as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he fires simultaneously
sarah screams as the
round blows stuffing out of the booth seat inches from her face
her hair is singed by burning gunpowder
an involuntary cry is punched out of her by the double concussions
reese is stroking up another shell as terminator half rises from booth
over reeses shoulder as he fires cocks the slide fires again advancing on sarahs booth
terminator is blown backward over the center divider crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the table opposite and onto the floor
sarah is screaming scrunched down in the booth
terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table full of drunk patrons
he has two rifled gauge slugs in his chest and one in the arm
the bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau cowering gaping
sarah stops screaming
reese stand motionless gun aimed
in the sudden silence the sound of him cocking the shotgun is abnormally loud
on terminator very still
then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the uzi machine pistol from beneath his overcoat where it has been hang ing on a shoulder strap
he doesnt seem too impaired as he swings around to fire
reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing
a burst from the uzi rakes the bar where he stood
an orgy of shattering glass
several angles as patrons of the bar run scream or dive for cover depending upon their level of intelligence
reese slides through the glass to sarahs booth and seizes her wrists
on terminator kneeling amid the chaos raising the uzi one handed
reese tugs viciously on sarahs arm and she sprawls across the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion erupt with hits from the uzi
angle on a running patron as a burst of mm fire catches him in the chest
he pitches into sarahs booth pinning her
reese fires ducks fires again
tables crash over
a window is blown out
a table candle rolls into a pool of high proof alcohol behind the bar
it ignites with a whoosh
reese feed two shells into the riot gun
tight on terminator an island of slow precise movement amid the confusion
he drops a spent clip
reaches for another with his bloody hand
moving with reese as he vaults the row of booths and starts firing
at point blank range he unloads the shotgun into terminators belly
terminator crashes backwards through two tables and a plate glass window into the street
the roaring fire behind the bar is spreading very quickly
the air is thick with smoke
reese tosses the uzi for which he has no ammo into the fire
he hauls the dead man off sarah and reaches for her
tight on sarah shrinking away from reese hysterical
when he grabs her wrist she struggles eyes wide
reese very intense
come with me if you want to live
she looks where he is pointing
terminator is rising unsteadily to his feet
shattered glass rains from him except where it sticks to his blood drenched shirt and coat
terminator as he slowly look up his blue eyes riveting straight into the camera
sarah feeling a lightning blot of terror greater than she could ever imagine as the cold gaze fixes on her
awed whisper oh my god
panaglide preceding terminator as he clambers back through the window and starts through the burning bar
panaglide moving in on reese and sarah as he runs drag ging her with him toward the back
reverse on terminator dollying as he crashed through the wreckage in the swirling smoke hurling burning tables out of his way
panaglide following reese and sarah running headlong through the cluttered kitchen then down a narrow back hallway
sarah stumbles and reese brutally pulls her to her feet without slowing
he hits a closed door which crashes open
hauls sarah through into another corridor
slams and blot latches it
an instant later an impact from the far side tears the latch screws half out of the wall
they run on
terminator takes a step back from the closed door and slams into it again
it starts to give way
behind him the flames engulf a can of cleaning solvent
reese and sarah pelt down the narrow corridor fling open the outside door and spin out into the alley
tight on door at far end
it splinters open and terminator sprints down the corridor
the cleaning solvent explodes
dollying ahead of terminator very fast as he runs full throttle
behind him a fireball of superheated gas hurtles down the narrow hallway
he clears the outer door an instant before the tongue of flame roars out into the alley
vukovichs plain car arrives slewing to a stop in the glass littered street in front of the blazing building
he leaps out traxler right in behind him
shouting what the fuck is going on
two lapd units arrive behind them
he motions to the nearest one
continuing cover the alley in back
he heads for the inferno at a run
dollying with reese and sarah as they run through the dark alley
sarah stumbles over trashcans
reese pulls her along mercilessly
whip panning as they clear a corner
is a blur
the night maze is a blur in all of these shots
no static angles
relentless forward motion
behind them terminator is moving with inhuman speed bounding like a panther leaping trash cans and other obstacles
terminator catching the faintest glimpse of a red glow in the pupils of his eyes as he passes through total shadow
we know this is terminators pov because sarah and reese are just ahead of us
but the image is bizarre alien
bright and hyper real
there is a hint of digitization and the fleeing figures ahead are more luminous than the background suggesting infra red
the margins of the frame are crammed with columns of crt type characters columns of numbers and acronyms
the data changes more rapidly than any human eye could follow
there is no doubt that we are seeing as a machine would see
the sound effects are bright and clear as if they are digitized and enhanced as well
reese and sarah turn a corner by caroming off the wall without slowing and pelt down a narrower alley
this one is lined with a row of parked cars and connects to the street
there is little room to run
reese is reloading on the run dropping shells
behind them terminator enters the alley gaining
low angle fast panaglide ahead of the fleeing pair
as they breast the last car reese shoves sarah hard pitching her on her face to the pavement
he flings open the car door
drops to the ground
fires into the gas tank of a car further back in the row just before terminator reaches it
the car explodes filling the alley with fire
an inferno funneled between the enclosing walls
angle on reese and sarah behind the car door as flames roar over the hood
on terminator as he slides to a stop cut off by the wall of flame
reese doesnt waste any time stuffing sarah into the car
climbing in after and over her he twists two wires together and we recognize it as his stolen grey sedan
the engine catches
a silhouette rockets out of the flames
terminator leaping from the roof of the blazing car ahead impacts on the hood of reeses car
his hair and coat are burning
reese jams reverse and nail the throttle
the car backs down the alley
terminator draws back his fist
punches into the windshield
inside sarah is sprayed with glass as the killers fist shoots through
the lacerated fingers grope for her
wide as the car shoots backwards out of the alley onto the street narrowly missing an arriving lapd cruiser
sarah plasters herself tightly into the seat as the fingers grasp her blouse and pull
reese cranks the wheel hard
the sedan skids slewing sideways into a parked car
terminator rolls down off onto the pavement
reeses car shoots forward
panning with sedan as it roars past vukovich the gathering minions of the burning building an arriving fire truck
shoots through a red light and continues to accel erate
terminator gets to a kneeling position then slowly stands
he pats out his smoldering clothing as he watches his quarry escape
on vukovich as he runs to his car exhorting the nearby lapd guys to give pursuit while traxler grabs the radio
hes got her
overlapping suspect westbound on olympic
has hostage repeat
low wide angle on the empty street which is narrow and tightly lines with parked cars
the roar of an engine builds
the sedan like a night demon hurtles out of the shadows with its lights off doing ninety plus
sarah is in a daze
she is shivering silently uncontrollably
her eyes are wide and it seems likely that she doesnt quite comprehend the roaring blur outside her window
calmly hold on
wide angle close to sedan and following it as it hurtles around a corner in an expertly controlled slide
then a high speed sprint down the cross street
reese squirrels the vehicle between a slow moving car ahead and oncoming traffic
a dive into another dark side street
reese drives with total nerveless absorption
his eyes flick to the mirror to the road over his shoulder back and the world spins outside
with occasional glances to sarah he speaks to her in a clipped military voice
are you injured
are you shot
he reaches over and runs his hands over her arms legs chest
she feels the blind panic boiling up within her
she pushes his hand away and opens the door
reese slams her back in the seat and slaps her
continuing do exactly what i say
dont move un less i say
dont make a sound unless i say
do you understand
as he speaks he is locking the door and fastening sarahs seatbelt over her cinching it very tightly like you would for a child
she doesnt answer
continuing shouting do you understand
a whisper yes
dont hurt me
im here to help you
reese sergeant tech com dn
sarah stares numbly at his outstretched hand
with zero strength she automatically returns his handshake
continuing assigned to protect you
youve been targetted for termination
the walls of a narrow alley inky black frame a police cruiser parked on the street beyond
firelight from the back of stokers lights the street garishly
a young cop stands beside the car talking via radio with the mike cord pulled through the side window
he speaks with a distinctive twang a displaced southerner
i dont know it looks like it might spread to this furniture warehouse across the alley the paint on the walls starting to blister up
the sweeping headlights of a turning car momentarily illuminate the face of terminator motionless in the dark right in front of us
continuing better get another truck round to this side
terminators silhouette emerges from the blackness and strides purposefully toward the cop camera following
the officer whirls and reaches for his gun but terminator flings him brutally into the side of the car steps over him and opens the door
before getting in he notes the unit number on the roof
then he slides behind the wheel slips the squad car into gear and pulls out
camera preceding car hide wide angle as it accelerates rapidly until the lines across the street are flashing under it in a staccato rhythm
sarah is slumped way down in the seat turned away from the window trying not to see the landscape reeling outside
hoarse whisper this is a mistake
i havent done anything
but you will
its very important that you live
sarah closes her eyes as if to shut it all out
i cant believe this is happen ing
how could than man get up after you
reeses tone is equal parts hatred and respect as he replies
not a man
cyber dynamics model
terminator drives expressionlessly monitoring the babble from central dispatch
he hears his number
filtered suspect vehicle sighted on motor at pico southbound
units two zero six and five seven attempt intercept
unit one four three come in
terminator picks up the mike
he speaks in a simulation of the young cops southern twang
this is one four three
west bound on olympic approaching overland
the grey sedan moves through traffic like a hell bent wraith
reese has the hammer down
he handles the car with nerves of steel
below reeses sedan snakes along at plus
the chopper f
drops toward it
filtered air unit two
were on him
westbound santa monica at
you mean like a robot
not a robot
they have to yell over the roar of air through the broken windshield
he was bleeding
at that moment a blinding light sears down on them from above
reese looks over his left shoulder and sees a chp cruiser coming alongside
just a second
keep your head down
the helicopter is right above the its spotlight burning on reese
the cruiser flanks them closing
reese peels off to the right inches in front of a tractor trailer rig brakes hard and slides into a four wheel drift through a curving off ramp
the helicopter banks following
the cruiser swaps ends trying to maneuver and slams broad side into the guardrail
out of action
the sedan roars across the street without slowing and vanishes down a tree lined side street
down angle aerial past the chopper f
as its searchlight sweeps over the close knit treetops
the sedan skids around a corner f
as the searchlight filters in shafts through the trees further down the street sweeping futility back and forth
it hovers indecisively then banks off
filtered lost him
reese is ultra alert craning to look up back forward
the terminators an infil tration unit
part man part machine
underneath its a hyperalloy combat chassis mircoprocessor controlled fully armored
he pauses as they slide around another corner
reeses sedan glides out onto a main drag very subdued
he turns the lights on and blends with traffic
the helicopter crosses laterally in the distance
continuing but outside its living human tissue
flesh skin hair
grown for the cyborgs
look reese i know you want to help but
cutting her off pay attention
the series had rubber skin
we spotted them easy
but these are new
they look human
sweat bad breath everything
very hard to spot
i had to wait til he moved on you before i could zero him
hey im not stupid yknow
they cant build anything like that yet
not for about forty years
reese is driving sedately for a low profile but his eyes rove constantly searching for a place to ditch the car
sarahs eyes are alert as well and her tone becomes a bit too cool
so its from the future is that right
one possible future
four your point of view
i dont know the tech stuff
and youre from the future too
they come to a red light and reese stops
like a shot she unlatches the seatbelt pulls the door lock and has the door half open before reese can react
he catches her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car
sarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength
his grip doesnt slacken
slowly without releasing her he reaches across with his other hand and shuts the door
his face shows no reaction
sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his arm from the bite that at his grim scarred face
the light turns green and reese drives on
sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth
coldly cyborgs dont feel pain
he wipes his hand on his pants
weakly plead ing just let me go
slow but intense listen
that terminator is out there
it cant be reasoned with it cant be bargained with
it doesnt feel pity of remorse or fear
and it absolutely will not stop
until you are dead
sarah slump in utter resignation
quietly can you stop it
reese doesnt look at her
with these weapons
i dont know
reeses car turns into the parking lot of a large hospital acres of pavement dotted with sporadic parked cars
angle through windshield on terminator as he searches
streetlights flare across rhythmically
it moves between two buildings searchlight sweeping back and forth
down angle past the chopper as the circle of light moves across a row of parked cars
it passes a grey sedan with a shattered windshield
tighter on car ground level in the glare and propwash
it looks empty
low angle dolly moving with reese and sarah as they crawl behind a row of parked cars
he has firm hold of her arm but she seems to be cooperating
in the b
the chopper hovers on the far side of the lot
reese approaches the door of a late model brown buick which has been left with its window partway down
he unlocks it and they slip inside
tight on terminator through the windshield of the black and white
filtered suspect vehicle located at parking lot cedar and glen haven
full shot as terminators cruiser slews in a radical turn and roars off in the opposite direction
reese uses the butt of the shotgun to smash loose the ignition assembly
he begins working on the wires
a police cruiser appears moving slowly between the rows of cars
reese grabs sarah and pulls her down to huddle below dash level
a moment later a spotlight flashes across the seats above them
they hear the helicopter circling closer
why does it want me
they are lying very close a forced intimacy
reeses voice is an urgent whisper almost in her ear
a cruiser passes so close they can hear its radio clearly
theres so much
just start at the beginning
reese musters his thoughts
there was a war
a few years from now
the whole thing
all this his gesture includes the car the city the world
continuing everythingis gone
there were survivors
nobody knew who started it
pause it was the machines
i dont understand
defense network computer
hooked into everything
trusted to run it all
they say it got smart
a new order of intelli gence
then it saw all people as a threat not just the ones on the other side
decided out fate in a microsecond
reese pauses and when he continues its less like a military briefing quieter
continuing didnt see the war
i was born after in the ruins
grew up there
hiding from the h ks
build in automated factories
most of us were rounded up put in camps
for orderly disposal
he pushes up the sleeve of his jacket and shows her a ten digit number etches on the skin of his forearm
beneath the numbers is a pattern of lines like the auto matic pricing marks on product packages
continuing burned in by laser scan
pause some of us were kept alive
the disposal units ran night and day
we were that close to going out forever
the helicopter moves overhead
its searchlight illum inates the car interior moves on
before the rotor sound fads reese starts the car
several black and whites are moving among the parked cars slowly
angle on terminators cruiser rolling along just above idle
he peers into the row of cars listening and seeing on level we cant
reese is holding onto sarahs shoulder tightly
continuing but there was one man
who taught us to fight
to storm the wire of the camps
to smash those metal mother fuckers into junk
he turned it around
he brought us back from the brink
pause his name is connor
your son sarah
your unborn son
sarah stared at him
the brown buick is f
as the nose of terminators cruiser appears behind it moving slowly
low angle past the back of the buick as terminator cruises by
the tailpipe f
terminators head snaps around
his eyes lock on reeses car
he reaches for his shotgun
reeses head jerks up looking in the mirror
reeses car launches forward from its space tires spinning as terminator fires from the window of the cruiser
the rear window explodes and reese ducks then cranks the wheel
reese and terminator race along opposite sides of a row of cars approaching the exit
the cruiser pulls ahead and closes diagonally as they clear the last car
reese sees the others shotgun leveled
he ducks steering blind keeps it floored
the windshield and side window explodes inward
the buick slams into the black and white spinning it into a parked truck
tires scream as the two cars slew around heading for the exit
several angles as the police react
the chopper banks tight and dives across the tops of the parked cars
cruisers race to converge
low wide angle preceding reeses buick as it hits the street accelerating
terminators cruiser slides out behind it fishtails races forward
engines roar as the cars go flat out
buildings lining the street become a blur
the chopper arcs in behind them
legitimate police lights blazing enter the pursuit one by one
low angle moving with terminators car as reese dodges across all lanes ahead of it
they run an intersection at a hundred plus
reese is feeding his last two shells into the riot gun
holding the gun is both hands he leans out the window still keeping the throttle mashed down
sarah grabs the wheel fighting to control the car
moving with the buick looking back as reese aims the shotgun buffeted by the windstream
terminators car b
over sarahs shoulder as they approach an intersection
red light their way and an alpha beta truck entering cross wise
past terminator f
his shotgun aimed as he comes along side
they are staring down each others barrels
sarah grabs the shift lever
detail shifter as she slams it into reverse
moving with both cars as the buick skids with rear tires locked
reese and terminator fire simultaneously
tight on reese as the doorpost next to his shoulder is torn out by the others blast
on terminator leaning to see around his shattered wind shield
he hurtles into the intersection past the skidding buick
clips the back of the semi
vaults the curb in a screeching front end roll
whip panning with the cruiser as it crashes upside down through the counter area of an a w
low angle as reese and sarah slide to a stop in a cloud of tire smoke
transmission fluid pours out of the car like blood
an instant later they are surrounded by an assortment of lapd sheriffs dept
and chp cars
the helicopter hovers overhead
medium on sarah and reese he raises his hands through the side window in plain sight
a phalanx of cops guns drawn approaches the car warily
sarah looks at reese
then at the cops
she opens the door and runs staggering toward them
vukovich steps forward and pulls her away to safety
reese watching her go as a cop eases his door open
two cops approach the overturned squad car jammed into the wreckage of the small building
they shine their flashlights inside
it is empty
the cyborg has vanished
a sign which reads drive in detaches from an awning and crashed down across the crushed auto
sarah huddles in a blanket is siting on a bench opposite vukovichs desk
her eyes are fixed on the middle distance
shes been crying
now shes emptied out
the door opens
at the sound of the latch sarah jerks as if struck and cringes involuntarily
vukovich enters with traxler and dr
peter silberman a criminal psychologist
silberman is smooth of skin and manner young ambitious and
he is enthusiastic about the workings of the human psyche as emotionally involved as someone pulling the wings off a fly
vukovich sits beside sarah and hands her a cup of coffee
he puts a paternal arm around her shoulders
here drink some of this
voice flat desperate lieutenant are you sure its them
maybe i should see the bodies
theyve already been identi fied
theres no doubt
sarah begins to cry again slowly and very quickly
to herself of god
kiddo im so sorry
vukovich takes the coffee cup from her as her arms sag and it starts to spill
pause sarah this is dr
id like you to tell him everything reese said to you
do you feel up to it
almost in audible i guess so
to silberman youre a doctor
a criminal psychologist
is reese crazy
thats what were going to find out
the room costs five dollars a night and thats steep but the fire escape outside the window adds an element of strategic value
a silhouette slips in through the window and click on the single bare light bulb
its terminator and hes a mess
a bloody scarecrow with bullet wounds in stomach chest shoulder and right wrist
medium on terminator as he sits at a ratty folding table under the light
his eyebrows are singed off
hair a charred stubble
left eyes glistening with imbedded glass shards
before him on the table is an array of small tools
he removes the charred remains of his jacket and props
one elbow on the table
angle past his non functional right arm f
as he exam ines it
he picks up an x acto knife and cuts deeply into the skin of his forearm
his expression is one of mild concentration
forearm as he pulls back a large flap of skin to reveal a complex trunk of sheathed cables and hydraulics
they slide as he moves his fingers
resume medium as terminator uses a rag to wipe away the blood
with small screwdrivers he begins to patiently dis assemble the damaged mechanism around the guage hit
the room is small furnished with only a table and two chairs
reese his arms handcuffed behind him sits opposite dr
behind silberman is a large mirror
a detective leans against the wall
youre a soldier
fighting for whom
with the one thirty second under perry from to interrupting the year
vukovich and traxler are seated in the dark room watching reese b
through the two way mirror
just behind the glass is a video camera on a tripod aimed at reese and a cart holding a small monitor and videocassette recorder
through speaker thats right
quietly to vukovich this is fucking great
then i was assigned recon security last two years under john connor
and who was the enemy
a computer defense system built for sac norad by cyber dynamics
a modified series
gravely i see
computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy kill ing him in effect before he is even conceived
a sort of retroactive abortion
traxler snorts and grins
to vukovich that silberman just crack me up
pause he had this guy in here last week who set his afghan on fire
screwed it first then set it on leaning forward shut up
it had no choice
the defensive grid was smashed
wed taken the mainframes
taking out connor then would make no difference
skynet had to wipe out his entire exist ence
we captured the lab complex
what ever it was called
the time displacement equipment
the terminator had already gone through
they sent two of us to intercept then zeroed the whole place
sumner didnt make it
then how are you supposed to get back
nobody goes home
nobody else comes through
its just him and me
terminator in profile showing his lacerated eye
he is close to a mirror practically touching it staring intently
macro x acto knife lying on the dresser
terminators fingers lift it
camera tilts to follow as it rises to his face holds tight on left eye
with a smooth motion the knife point enters the eyeball and cuts away the ruins sclera and cornea as well as part of the damaged eyelids
he wipes with a rag to clear the electronic eyes vision
revealing the faintly glowing lens mechanism suspended in a chrome socket by tiny servos
the eye whirs quietly as it tracks
sequence of shots showing various repairs
terminators right hand its wrist sutured crudely holds a needle and sewing thread and starts to work on abdominal wound out of frame below
he slips a glove over the damaged hand
a motoring cap over the blistered scalp
a fresh shirt to hide his body wounds
this is followed by a new overcoat
terminator contemplating his reflection in the mirror
with the hat pulled down the collar pulled up and favoring his right profile he looks unhurt
though a bit gaunt and pale
a turn of his head brings the balefully glowing left eye in its metal socket into view
he slips on a pair of tight wrap around sunglasses
full shot as he goes to the bed and flips up the stained mattress
he picks up the remington gauge the ar and the
off the springs and leaves by the fire escape
tight on video monitor showing reese in the interrogation room
recorded its just him and me
cut wide revealing sarah silberman vukovich and traxler watching a monitor sitting amid incredible paperwork clutter on a desk top
recorded why didnt you bring any weapons
something more advanced
dont you have ray guns
traxler standing in the back grins and nudges silberman who nods appreciatively
tight on reeses recorded image he glares at silberman
on sarah as silbermans voice is heard
recorded show me a piece of future technology
recorded con trolling his hostility you go naked
something about the field generated by a living organism
nothing dead will go
recorded i didnt build the fucking thing
consults his notes cyborg
if its metal
recorded surrounded by living tissue
recorded of course
the real silberman put the tape on pause
excited this is great stuff
i could make a career out of this guy
you see how clever this part is
how it doesnt require a shred of proof
most paranoid delusions are intricate
but this is brilliant
he starts the tape again
recorded why were the other two women killed
recorded most official records were lost in the war
the computer knew almost nothing about connors mother
where she lived just the city
no scanner pictures
the terminator was just being systematic
reese on screen as he goes on
recorded con tinuing youve heard enough
are you going to release me
recorded im afraid thats not up to me
recorded voice rising then why am i talking to you
on sarah dollying slowly in to c
as we hear reese begin to shout
recorded i can help you
who is in authority here
reese on screen as he looks straight at the camera
recorded you still dont get it
hell find her
thats what he does
all he does
medium on vukovich gesturing to silberman who is near the machine to kill it
recorded con tinuing you cant stop him
hell wade through you
reese on screen rising partway out of his chair yelling
recorded continuing reach down her throat and pull her fucking heart out
the screen goes black
vukovich has cut off the tape
glancing around sorry
sarah staring at the empty screen
turning so reese is crazy
in technical terminology hes a loon
vukovich hands her something that looks like umpires padding
sarah this is body armor
out tac guys wear it
itll stop a gauge round
this other individual mustve had one under his coat
sarah want to believe him
god help her if hes wrong
but what about him punching through the windshield
shrugs probably on pcp broke every bone in his hand and wont feel it for hours
there was this guy once that
vukovich cuts him off with a gesture and sits beside sarah on the bench
why dont you just stretch out here and get some sleep
itll take your mom a good hour to get here from redlands
i cant sleep
therere thirty cops in this building
she lays her head on a wadded up blanket as everyone leaves the office
vukovich pauses outside the door lost in thought
traxler studies him for a second
pause ed come on
the guys a wacko
vukovich glances up
quietly hed better be
silberman can be seen through a glass partition next to the bullet proof glass booth enclosing the night desk sergeants counter
the sergeant hits a button and there is a loud bull clack
the electric bolt on the security door opens and silberman steps out
as he exits the station he passes terminator just coming in the front door
he glances at the pale apparition in cap and dark wrap arounds but goes on
terminator approaches the desk sergeant who barely glances up when he speaks
im a friend of sarah connor
i was told she is here
can i see her please
you cant see here
shes making a statement
where is she
its gonna be a while
you wanna wait
theres a bench
terminator steps back scanning the booth the electric door the rooms beyond
ill come back
he turns and walks out through the front doors
angle past desk sergeant f
on front doors the officer is absorbed in paperwork not watching as a pair of lights get brighter outside the doors
he glances up at the last second as the glare falls fully on him
several cops and late night loiterers scatter as a car smashes into the foyer
it blasts through the sergeants booth crushing him in the wreckage
sarah lying on the couch jerks awake as the crash reverberates through the building
she sits up bleary eyes
through the hole in the splintered wall we see terminator leap out of the car
he vaults the hood and smashes through the debris of the wall
leaps to the corridor floor in a shower of plaster fragments
he brandishes the ar like a pistol in one hand the in the other
the shotgun dangles at his side on a shoulder sling
low angle dolly preceding him as he starts down the corridor
angle on lounge doorway as two cops run into the hall one carrying a cup of coffee
terminator fires a burst from the assault rifle
angle on cops they are flung backward in a spray of coffee and plaster
sarah is alert now with growing alarm
the sound of gunfire is faint
her expression shows the dawning certainty of what is happening
terminator steps over the bodies of the two cops without breaking stride
over his shoulder moving with him as he walks down the hall
comes to a door
kicks it in
a desk cop drawing his gun sprints for cover
angle on terminator raising the ar
in computer enhanced vision we see the cop dash around a corner in slow motion
as he disappears behind the wall an animated outline of him is still visible
a probabilistic extrapolation of his motion
there is a target cross hair following the figure
the wall erupts with a volley of shots beside the running cop and he is flung out of frame
shots are echoing in the hallway as vukovich whips open the door startling the hell out of sarah
he turns the locking knob and slams the door
leaving her alone
she flinches as more shots sound
terminator rips the cover off the stations main electrical panel
he pulls loose the hose like volt incoming line and feeds it directly into the lighting circuit
all down the corridor the overhead fluorescent units explode showering sparks and glass
the building is plunged into darkness
arcs sputter and flare lighting the corridors strobo scopically
sarahs terror skyrockets when the ceiling lamp explodes and the office goes black
through the smoke and emergency spotlights terminator moves forward inexorably
a door behind him opens
a cop fires hitting him in the shoulder
terminator fires straight arm with the
without slowing killing the cop then fires down the corridor with the assault rifle
traxler leaves the other detective to guard reese who is still handcuffed to the chair
exciting watch him
the door closes
an instant later a chair smashes over the detectives back just as he is turning toward his prisoner
reese is on him scrabbling for the keys
traxler is running down the hall through smoke and the wild strobing of electrical fires as vukovich steps out of an armory room
he tosses traxler an m and they run on
terminator stops before another door
he blasts the lock with the riot gun
flings open the door scanning
he is hit twice chest and leg
firelight flickers from an office doorway as he passes
sarah scrabbles for a place to hide in the darkened room but its so tiny
behind the desk
she crouches unable to believe she has awakened into the same nightmare
angle on door as it splinters open and terminator stands guns raised
a cop fires from behind a desk
terminator sprays the room
starts to reload
vukovich edges open a door and fires half a clip into terminators back
his eyes bulge as the intruder turns slamming a clip into his rifle and calmly fires two rounds
traxler drags vukovichs body back inside the room
tight on terminator moving forward intent medium on sarah her teeth are chattering with fear as shots echo nearby
there is the rhythmic thunder of the shotgun rattling automatic fire screaming and the sound of running feet
slow dolly in on sarah begins ending in tight c
as the sounds get louder
smoke begins to seep under the door
detail doorknob rattling as it is tried from outside
sarah stifling a cry
she flinches as if slapped as shots sound
detail door knob a series of shots shatter the lock
full on doorway the door bangs open and a figure stands silhouetted in the smoky hallway holding a pistol
sarah as she closes her eyes
holds her breath
full shot she scrambles out from beneath the desk and runs to him in the thickening smoke
panaglide following reese and sarah as they cross the corridor and move through a series of offices doubling back toward the main entrance
sarah and reese move rapidly through the smoke
gunfire sounds nearby
they pass bodies
they find the lieutenant propped in a corner dying
reese bends toward him
vukovich holds out his custom colt python
continuing you just keep her alive
do what you have to
reese snatches the gun and the keys and runs on
vukovich watching them go
fast panaglide preceding terminator as he runs through the smoky rooms
a fire is burning lighting everything a flickering orange
he emerges onto a landing through a side entrance
pan to follow his line of sight as he snaps the ar to his shoulder
a blue volkswagen rabbit is roaring away across the parking lot
tight on terminator aiming carefully
he pulls the trigger
slowly he lowers the scope sight from his eye and watches them go
terminator limps down the steps from the landing and walks away as the fire spreads behind the windows of division headquarters
detail gas gauge it reads empty
the rabbit is stopped on the shoulder of a two lane secondary road winding through the hills north of l
reese is fishing objects out of the cars trunk and handing them to sarah who holds a flashlight
he hands her a blanket some road flares and a first aid kit
then he slams the trunk
reaching through the side window he turns the wheel and pushes the car off the shoulder over the embankment
down angle into ravine past sarah and reese as the car trundles down crashing through the underbrush to dis appear among the trees
reese looks out across the valley and the lights of l
a helicopter circles in the distance searchlight on
lets get off the road
angle looking out from the mouth of an enclosed concrete storm drain that passes under the road
reese followed by sarah trudges down the slope and ducks inside
the floor is wet but he doesnt seem to mind
they both hunker down with their backs to the concrete facing each other
they look beaten grimy exhausted
she huddles under the blanket waif like
she sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each other with the blanket covering both of them
you got a first name
kyle whats it like when you go through time
like being ripped inside out
like being born maybe
sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket
oh my god
in the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening with blood
i caught one back there
incredulous caught one
you mean you got shot
its not bad
sarah sits up and turns toward him
we gotta get you to a doctor
are you crazy
let me see it
sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder
take this off
she cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens the first aid kit as he removes his jacket
looking at the wound see
passed through the meat
sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound
this is gonna make me puke
talk about something
tell me about my son
is he tall
she places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it
about my height
he has your winces damn
he has your eyes
sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back to work
whats he like
thoughtful you trust him
hes got that strength
youd die in a second for john
well at least i know what to name him
i dont suppose youd know who the father is
so i dont tell him to get lost when i meet him
john never said much about him
even before the war
i dont want to know
it was john that ordered you here
it was an honor
a chance to meet the legend
who taught her son to fight
from when he was a kid
when you were in hiding before the war
she stops taping
she seems lost her bravado dissipated
you talk about things i havent done yet in the past tense
its making me crazy
i cant think
pause are you sure youve got the right person
reese appraises her coldly
come on me
the mother of the future
am i tough
i cant even balance my checkbook
i cry when i see a cat thats been run over
and i dont even like cats
she pulls the bandage tight with a knot
no its okay
its better tight
and anyway what do i know about guerrilla warfare
angry look reese i didnt ask for this honor and i dont want it
any of it
john gave me a message for you
made me memorize it
this is the message
sarah thank you
for your courage through the dark years
i cant help you with what you must soon face except to tell you that the future is not set
there is no such thing as fate but what we make for ourselves by our own will
you must be stronger than you imagine you can be
you must survive or i will never exist
sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real to her
reese moves his arm testing the bandage
continuing good field dressing
brightening you like it
its my first
he rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth conserving embrace
sarah gazes out the entrance into the night
itll be light soon
closing her eyes okay
talk some more
murmuring about where youre from
kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance
pause you stay down by day but at night you can move around
the h ks use infra red so you still have to watch out
but theyre not too bright
john taught us ways to dust them them
thats when the infiltra tors started to appear
the terminators were the newest the worst
during his monologue we have panned into the darkness outside and to the helicopter which flies out of frame leaving black
a rotor roar fades up
with a roar an aerial patrol craft enters close overhead
it has flashing red and blue lights and powerful search lights which stab down
to a vista of moonlit devastation
white ash blows in drifts among fire gutted ruins
blackened bones lie everywhere in heaps
searchlights sweep the night
another aerial unit hovers several blocks away firing tracers into the ruins
as a gleaming chrome h k grinds through the debris of the shattered street on its tank like tracks crushing burnt skulls
its head turns slowly playing high intensity lights over the buildings
its hydraulic arms are folded mantis like against its torso
after it passes a number of human figures dart from shadow to shadow b
reese is among a squad of men in black fatigues carrying equipment and energy rifles who enter a debris littered tunnel
panaglide with them as they trot through a labyrinth of tunnels pass several guard posts
reese has a german shepherd on a short leash
the platoon enters a cavernous chamber an old parking structure in which a large group is gathering
as the entrance armed sentries with dogs are passing in new arrivals men wearing mismatched uniforms or rags and carrying all types of weapons from lasers to shotguns
weapons are left at the sentry post
following reese as he patrols the perimeter
he walks along a row of cars models from the eighties and nineties now stripped rusty and modified to carry weapons
there are conventional military vehicles as well
he passes several family groups
gaunt kids are huddles around an old tv set
its glow bathes them
reverse angle reveals that the set has been gutted and a small cookfire crackles inside the shell
nearby a kid has a large rat cornered and is whacking it with a stick
reese pauses at the end of the row of vehicles and unsnaps a pocket in his tunic removing a small paper rectangle a worn photograph
reese gazing down
his head snaps around at the sudden sound of barking
angle on sentry post as the dogs go crazy
an innocuous rag dressed man flips back his poncho to reveal a powerful plasma rifle
he opens fire running forward
energy bolts rip into the crowd
moving with reese running toward the terminator
powerbolts explode among the fleeing people
beams sear the darkness
a running child is burst by a plasma hit
angle on reese running
he levels his energy rifle and starts firing
a powerbolt grazes his cheek exploding a support column behind him
part of the roof collapses as reese tumbles
everything is lit as if by lightning
reese semi conscious
impressions implode on him running feet flashes energy beams raking the ground leaving molten worm tracks scream ing a burning dog howling
detail the picture reese has been looking at has fallen forgotten
it catches fire and starts to curl
before the image vanishes we see that it is a picture of sarah
reese looks up
a figure looms above a silhouette in the smoky hellish glare
its eyes glow red
a brilliant explosion whites out the screen
sarah brightly lit by daylight
she grimaces and groans
in the distance a dog is barking
reese still holding her lightly lifts her hair from her face
an uncharacteristically tender gesture
he gently caresses her cheek with the backs of his fingers
when she awakens suddenly he snaps his hand away
sarah looks around momentarily disoriented
looks up at reese
i was dreaming about dogs
reese extricates himself from her and steps out of the culvert
we used them to spot terminators
sarah groans as she straightens her legs
its pretty terrifying
sarah catches up to him just as he is about to try and stop an approaching car
she pulls his gun hand down with both of hers
put that away
ill get one
she hold out her thumb to passing traffic
reese watches this incomprehensible ceremony skeptically
continuing this works
reese and sarah are crammed into the cab of a beat to hell pickup truck with the driver obviously a surfer
laid back long haired and well tanned
reese glowers and watches the scenery through slitted eyes
and when it breaks right off the point they get some pretty rad tubes up there
not awesome but i mean worth the drive if youre hardcore like me
to sarah rad tubes
to reese hes a surfer
you from back east of something
no hes from the future
i hear that
pause listen i had a rough night
i gotta stop and bag some zs
they pull off the highway toward a gas station rest area
the gas station is like an oasis of clutter in a rolling stretch of meadows and woods
it consists of a bunker like building with restrooms and a flanking picnic area beyond which are woods
people sit under the trees enjoying the beautiful day while children tear around after the forced inactivity of a long trip
the three of them get out on unsteady legs
you can still ride if you wanna hang out for a couple hours
bag some zs
lets get cleaned up kyle
she heads for the womens restroom and kyle follows her inside
pushing him out yours is over there
instead of following her directions to the mens room kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain
a bunch of kids are running around and throwing water at each other with paper cups
reese shambles through them like a zombie
he stands among the children an alien in this land without fear
he watches people at picnic tables laughing and listening to portable music
can you get my balloon
down angle on an achingly beautiful little girl of about four
she points above his head
reese looks up to see a helium filled mylar balloon stuck in the foliage of a tree just above him
he pulls it down by the string and holds it turning it over dully
he crouches down to her eye level
arent you afraid to be out in the open like this
reese whirls reflexively at a scream behind him
the mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands
a teenage girl is being doused with water by the boys with plastic jugs
the little girl looks at the broken balloon then glares at reese
she punches him soundly on the shoulder and storms off
at this moment she is bowled over by an irish setter that licks her face while she shrieks with laughter
reese seems about to smile but doesnt quite know how to go about it
sarah is talking on an open pay phone
i know mom
this is the soonest i could
mom i cant talk long
no im okay
pause i was on tv
pause oh no i hate that picture
why didnt you give them my graduation picture
pause im okay really
listen i want you to pack some stuff and go up to the cabin for a few days
no dont ask any questions
just do it
i gotta get going
sarah has been idly leafing through the directory
on a whim she looks up something
she freezes for a moment when she finds the listing
then with a triumphant expression she rips the page out of the book
sarah is sitting at a table under a tree lettering something with a lipstick on a cardboard box flap
sign as the last letters are finished
it reads full on sarah as she retracts the lipstick and leans across to hand it to a girl at the next table
thanks a lot
sarah looks up startled to see him standing beside her
thats where were going
sarah point to the directory page lying on the table
sarahs finger points to a listing which reads el camino real svale she looks smug
i found it
isnt that it
cyber dynamics corporation
what about it
didnt you say that theyre going to develop this revolutionary new thing
they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build el computer grande
for the government
uneasy thats the way it was told to me
sarahs fear has been replaced by excitement
well were gonna uninvent the bastard
eighty six it
well blow up the place
burn it down
very cold tactically dangerous
we lay low
think it through
we can prevent the war
nobody else is gonna do it
if we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again
we have to so it ourselves
thats not my mission
upset mocking his manner listen
im not a military objective reese
im a person
you dont own me
reese takes her arm and pulls her to her feet
time to move out
let go of me
she jerks her arm free
he reaches for her again but she outdistances him running
warning tone sarah
she dashes down a footpath among the trees clutching her sign
reese follows her into the woods
only a few yards from the picnic area the woods take over completely
as she runs down the path
reese tackles her from behind and they fall together in the long spring grass
she struggles violently to get away
she gets one arm free and whacks him hard in the face
reese reacts instinctively leaping back in a defensive crouch
sarah freezes when she sees the
in his hand
continuing scared but angry oh thats real smart
go on shoot me
reese is trembling as he lowers the gun
sarah too is shaking with emotion
tears roll down her cheeks and her voice cracks
continuing jesus christ reese
cant you see im scared
he straightens up and his arms go limp at his sides
he turns away
continuing i cant spend my life waiting for that thing to catch up with me
always looking over my shoulder wondering if i left some tiny clue behind
reese doesnt respond
the gun slips from his fingers
his will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees
the moment stretches
there is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the leaves the sound of a small stream nearby birds chirping
she crawls over to him
in profile with sarah in b
his eyes are closed
a tear meanders down his cheek
continuing quietly kyle
a whisper im wrong here
i wasnt meant to see this
he gestures at their surroundings
like some dream
he touches the grass the trunk of a tree
continuing and you
it hurts sarah
more than death
he looks are her beseechingly
continuing dont you understand
its all gone
sarah puts her arm around him
she sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand
we can change it kyle
we have to try
she takes his shoulder in her hands
continuing theres no fate but what we make for ourselves
lets go kiddo
he picks up her sign and they look at each other for a second then get up
terminator sits in his room with the blinds drawn tight
with knife slits of hot sunlight
sitting on the edge of the bed
his appearance isnt improving
a patch of scalp is blown away revealing chrome underneath
a flap of skin dangles from his cheek which exposes some of the drive cables which move the lips
he is scanning sarahs address book turning a page every two seconds
his eyes tracking rapidly
his skin is waxy white bruised gangrenous in places
he ignores the few flies crawling on his face
showing sarahs book
in microseconds the handwritten entries are translated into crt type characters and displayed to one side of the screen
this updates instantly as the page is turned
a middle aged man with a torn t shirt covering his paunch knocks on the door
he is wheeling a trash cart
hey buddy you got a dead cat in there of what
as he looks up
the digitized image pans to the door and a logic flow diagram appears overlaid in color coded words
it con cluded with a list of potential appropriate responses the last begins to flash and enlarges to fill the screen
fuck you asshole
he returns to his scan
the man shrugs and walks down the hall
the two fugitives walk toward an economy motel of the two story park by the door variety
sarah turns to wave as a tractor trailer pulls away noisily heading back to the interstate
the driver answers her wave out the side window
reese stops for a moment outside the motel office to pet a german shepherd sitting on the porch
the dog wags its tail and licks his hand
reese opens the door and they go in
reese pulls a crumpled wad of bills from his jeans and shows it to sarah
is this enough
and i dont want to know where you got it
she turns to the desk clerk a female version of the pawn shop lizard
to clerk we need a room
with a kitchen
kyle and sarah enter the spartan room
im dying for a shower
you could use one too
and wed better check that bandage
im going out for materiel
he hands her the
he took off the detective
she takes it without thinking as he leaves then realizes that she has a loaded gun in her hand without the slightest idea of how to use it
she lays it gently on the dresser
as an afterthought she turns it with one finger so that it is pointing the other way
sarah moves the curtain slightly and looks outside
reese walks away toward a commercial area visible down the road
sarah is on the phone her hair still wet from a shower
she sits on the bed with a towel wrapped around her
no mom i cant tell you where i am
i was told not to say
filtered but honey i need to know where i can reach you or ill be worried sick
it turns out i cant stay up here
the electricitys off
and i dont know just where ill be
sarah hesitates then okay heres the number
are you ready
filtered go ahead
slow pan around the room as the conversation between sarah and her mom continues completely voice over
filtered i got it
the pan continues revealing an overturned chair
filtered okay ive gotta go
im sorry i cant tell you very much now mom
i love you
the pan comes to a table
a spatter of blood
it follows the phone cord onto terminator in close up as he continues in a perfect simulation of her mothers voice
i love you too sweetheart
sarah hangs up the phone vaguely disturbed
terminator rapidly dials the number sarah gave
pause tell me your address there
covering the counter beside the hot plate in the tiny apartment
reeses hands split one open and its contents spill out
sarah looks through reeses haul
whats for dinner
there are also boxes of shotgun shells road flares tape scissors pans a strainer and many other odd utensils substances chemicals
bit more stable
i learned howto make it when i was a kid
sarah looks a bit stricken as she contemplates the evening ahead
the dashlight illuminated terminator from beneath as he drives through the night
he looks like death
his left eye glows a faint red in the darkness
a heartwarming domestic scene
sarah and kyle have pulled the dresser out to use as a worktable
pans packages and bottles clutter the kitchen b
on the table between them are eight ten inch lengths of plumbers pipe threaded each end
kyle is showing sarah how to tamp the high explosive putty into the pipe bombs and seal them shut
make sure theres none on the threads like this
now screw the end cap on
you must have had a fun child hood
now seven more like that while i make fuses
i was thinking theres so much ive got to show you when we get through this
its mind boggling the pos sibilities
disneyland the beach movies
matinees with popcorn and foot long hot dogs
i want to buy you a hot dog so bad kyle
all the things youve never seen and done
youre here but wherever you go and whatever you touch you bring the war with you
my whole life has been combat
i want it to be over for you
i want it to be over for me too
i feel like i slipped over some invisible line that im in your world now
everythings the same but i see it differently
its like theres you and me and him
but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us
reese looks up and finally catches her gaze
he reaches out for her hand and it seems he may be taking it to comfort her
but he turns her wrist to read her watch
well head out at
that gives you four hours to sleep if you want
angle on table the bombs are neatly ranked finished
a nylon satchel lies nearby
the mess is cleaned up
wide shot reveals reese sitting in silent vigil at the window
the room is dark lit only by a streetlight outside
sarah is asleep on the bed
reese sits cross legged shirtless his body held rigid
the image of discipline
is held loosely in one hand on his lap
there is a fresh bandage on his shoulder
sarah wakes up and goes to him in the darkness
he looks at her for a moment as she sits beside him then back outside
hell find us wont he
sarah if i get zeroed
dont say that
if i do you have to get away disappear without a trace
different country different name everything
in case they send another one
itll never be over will it
look at me im shaking
some legend huh
you must be pretty disappointed
several beats before sarah speaks again
her eyes seem luminous in the dark
softly kyle the women in your time
what were they like
thats not what i meant
was there someone special
he looks away outside the window softly im sorry
sarah studies him for a moment
shes sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands on his shoulders and back tracing the lines of his scars with her fingertips
so much pain
pain can be controlled
you disconnect it
and so you feel nothing
its better that way
with great sympathy oh kyle
reese takes a long slow breath before he answers and when he does his voice has a new quality an unfamiliar tenderness
john connor gave me a picture of you once
i never knew why
it was very old
you were young like you are now
you werent smiling
just a little sad
i always wondered what you were thinking at that second
he closes his eyes reaches toward her
his fingertips trace the contour of her nose chin cheeks
continuing i memorized every line every curve
he opens his eyes looking right at hers
continuing sarah i came across time for you
i love you
i always have
sarah is quietly overwhelmed
reese looks away
continuing im sorry
i shouldnt have said
she leans forward and kisses him
his face is frozen
she continues tenderly
he begins to respond
the dam breaks and he holds her in a tight trembling embrace clinging to her like life itself
kyle picks her up and carries her to the bed
she kisses his neck and chest tracing his scars with her lips
he unbuttons her blouse very slowly
sarah guides his powerful hands over her
sarah a very close angle as she grimaces in divine agony
reese his face rapt
his hand clutching the pillow as if to kill it
it is explosive torrential
a confluence of fate and will
tight on sarah and reese in each others arms
lying across his chest she surveys his face as his eyes close drowsily
i bet youre ticklish
uncompre hending ticklish
sarahs hand moves out of frame
after a moment reese looks down puzzled
what are you doing
continuing doggedly youll beg for mercy in a second
reese seems unperturbed
finally he begins to squirm
i dont think i like this
youre not supposed to
now reese is becoming desperate
a grimace spreads across his face
it becomes a grin
then hes laughing trying to escape but she wont let him and they collapse laughing together
sarah gazes at his grin a glimpse of the reese that might have been in another life
a moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking outside
reese is off the bed in an instant crouched tense eyes alert
feral as ever
whispering listen to the dogs
the german shepherd barking furiously lunges toward camera repeatedly at the end of a chain
a dark figure moves by in the f
out of the dogs reach
the digitized view is image intensified bright and stark as a lunar landscape
pan off the lunging dog to the row of rooms facing the parking lot
handheld as we approach the doors
it is wide angle and the barrel of the ar is visible at the bottom of frame
the nearest vehicle parked in front is a large pickup truck with two dirt bikes lashed in the bed seen prominently as we pass
the pov approaches a door
the door is kicked open
the assault rifle sprays the room exploding the indistinct forms on the bed
approaching the bed
nothing there put the shredded remain of sheets and pillows
the pov shifts to the back door which is ajar and moves toward it
through the door
revealing an empty yard
reese is under the dash playing with the wires
sarah lies on the seat clutching the nylon satchel which bulges with the explosive charges
she has dressed hastily and is barefoot
light it now
sarah has been holding a bic lighter near the tip of a fuse
she thumbs the flame on
the fuse catches as reese twists the wires and the engine starts to turn over
terminator spins at the sound of the truck engine catching
fast panaglide with him as he runs the length of the suite stops outside the front door
whips the ar to his shoulder
the truck is backing wildly across the lot b
terminator turns looking into camera as a sizzling sound becomes audible
detail pipe charge lying just inside the door in the shadows
the fuse is burning
wide shot on doorway from the parking lot as terminator takes two leaping strides forward and the charge explodes
the front of the building is blown to kindling
terminator is flung forward by the blast
panning rapidly as the truck shoots out of the parking lot and tears down the street
terminator lies face down motionless f
as the debris from the blast settles
a young guy on a honda crosses the parking lot and stops near him running forward
terminator starts to get up moving slowly
crouching be side him dont try to move buddy
moving with terminator as he shoves the cyclist aside and approaches the bike which is still running
digitized pov approaching the cycle
the image reduces to graphic outlines with separate systems color coded
it breaks down suddenly into individual side top and plan views
all in less than four seconds
reese slides the truck into an on ramp and guns in onto the freeway burying the throttle
traffic is light
a few wheelers
the truck tops out at and he holds it
they flicker rapidly through pools of light and shadow
angle over reeses shoulder as they hurtle forward
an interchange flashes by in an instant
pacing with the truck looking back as a single headlight arcs radically across all lanes behind them and grows low wide angle preceding terminator on the bike
he is tucked getting as much speed as possible out of the
as he gains on the camera filling frame he unslings the assault rifle
raises it against the windstream in a one handed pistol grip
reese motions sarah to keep her head down
he pulls the colt python from his coat pocket
steering with his elbows he checks the load
snaps the cylinder shut
glances in the rear mirror
turns the wheel
wide angle following close to terminator as he closes on the pickup b
the truck swerves suddenly diving around a tractor trailer
terminator leans hard to follow
low wide angle preceding the pickup and terminator as they swerve as high speed
reese uses the slow semis as static obstacles
he misses them by inches tires squealing
angle over sarahs shoulder through the front window as the back of a semi trailer hurtles toward them straight ahead
high angle following both vehicles as reese feints right and then skids left
he slides toward the trailer in a four wheel drift as terminator commits to the right
terminator over the barrel of the ar as he fires
side angle passing truck trailer bullets strafe across it as the pickup vanishes behind
terminator skids the bike barely missing an abutment and is forced onto an low side angle preceding terminator as he roars down the off ramp without slowing
runs the red light at the bottom as a hundred miles an hour
climbs the on ramp
sarah is buffeted as reese fights to control the skidding truck
the angle is past reese f
terminator appears b
converging rapidly as the on ramp joins the freeway
switch places with me
she slides over him while he keeps the hammer down
reese is out the window to the waist aiming double handed
they enter an interchange
ahead lies a long sweeping curve two lanes wide and elevated
terminator rocks back from a round between the eyes that bares metal the fires
bullets rake the pickup
the windows are blown out
the side mirror explodes
reese is hit
sarah screams and weaves barely in control
sarah reaches across and pulls reeses limp body back inside
he slumps on the seat moaning
he has a bullet in the chest
another has broken his arm
sarah feels all hope recede
terminator crosses behind the truck coming up on sarahs side
sarah shrieks as the doorpost next to her head clangs with the short burst empties the gun
it clatters to the pavement a moment later discarded
terminator draws the
hits the breaks hard
cranks the wheel
glass behind her explodes with gunfire
swerving viciously the truck slams the bike sending it flying into a guardrail
terminator goes over the handle bars at a hundred miles per hour
sarah fights the wheel losing control of the slewing pickup
terminator hits the pavement tumbling rolling sliding with a chattering screech and spraying sheets of sparks as flesh strips away and steel screams on concrete
the pickup swaps ends violently smashing into the guardrail
terminator hits the guardrail bounces up tumbles along the top and then pitches out into space
terminator smashes to the pavement in the middle lane and lies there face down
sarah is slammed hard as the truck grinds to a stop against the guardrail
she checks kyle
he is barely conscious
sarah heaves open the door
runs to the guardrail
after a long moment terminator slowly rolls over and sits up
low angle as he rises into frame a mass of blood
clothing and skin in tatters
headlights flare behind him and an airhorn blares
full shot as a double trailer kenworth gasoline tanker smashes him down and under with a metallic crash
angle under tanker as terminator rolls clattering and the mass blurs above him
he ricochets between the pavement and the speeding undercarriage until a stray bounce flings him up into the rear suspension
at the railing looking down
she raises one fist into the air triumphantly
the stunned driver hits the brakes
his partner grabs his arm
they lock eyes for a moment
i have to man
terminator clings with inhuman strength to the rear suspen sion
the pavement blurs by beneath him
the air brakes howl
sarah watches the truck roll on without leaving a body in its wake
she feels a premonitory dread
beneath the braking semi terminator crawls upside down hand over hand like a human fly toward camera
the left eye glows like a coal in the dark
as the pavement stops beneath him he drops off and rolls out from under the truck
the driver looks around in astonishment as his door is ripped open
a grisly apparition
flings the driver out and takes his place behind the wheel
ignoring the terrified partner he examines the controls
in digitized cyborg vision we see an abstract of the instruments
the shift lever is extended graphically down into a three dimensional schematic of the trans mission
analytical data prints out rapid fire
from the railing sarah sees the tanker below as a body falls beside it rolling
the truck swings in a slow arc
heads back toward her on the wrong side of the freeway
she stares in numb horror
the nightmare refuses to end
she runs to the crippled pickup and sees a front tire flat shredded by a crumpled fender
she searches the cab frantically for the keys to the motorcycles
finds them above the sun visor
sarah leaps into the bed of the pickup and attacks the motorcycle strap downs frantically
panting with terror she rolls the bike off the truck
it crashes on its side and she falls on it painfully
straining until she cries out involuntarily she lifts it upright
kicks the engine over
as the tanker crashes back through the divider and starts up the overpass
sarah is trapped in that concrete corridor
she kicks for her life
the bike catches for a moment
the truck bellows down shifting on the curving grade
sarah kicks again and again crying out with each stroke
again and again furiously
the engine catches
rapidly come on come on come on run you
the bike runs with a healthy roar
up the face of the tractor trailer the retaining wall blur ring by
terminators red eye can be seen through the wind shield
sarah drags reese stumbling to the bike props him on the seat behind her
he clutches the satchel weakly
hold on real tight okay
she guns the engine and roars off
as the tanker demolishes the pickup a moment later tossing sarah hits level freeway with a quarter mile lead on the tanker distant b
but the little bike is overloaded and she cant coax it above seventy five
angle on tanker roaring forward shifting up through the gears
close on sarah and kyle his head lolling on her shoulder
he starts to fall sideways
shouting hold on goddamnit
he rouses slightly gripping her tighter
high angle moving with both vehicles as sarah starts to zigzag desperately across all four lanes
the truck stays with her closing its trailer whiplashing violently
the truck is right behind them as then enter a tunnel
a half mile of exitless concrete and strobing fluorescent lights
sarah and kyle process shot he blinks and looks back at a solid wall of metal and lights looming behind them
sarah hunches down
they hit eighty
full shot the leviathan dwarfs them its big tires roaring like the hubs of hell
the tanker is twenty feet behind them as they clear the tunnel
sarah dodges to one side and locks the brakes
the bike slides fish tailing
the truck roars past hitting the air brakes
the trailers force her closer and closer to the guardrail as terminator tries to sandwich her
the bike slides to a stop
the rearmost set of trailer wheels slams into the guardrail right in front of sarah
sarah emerges from a cloud of tire smoke cutting across all four lances behind the stopped semi
sarah tries to ride down the steep embankment but loses control spilling the bike
she and kyle tumble down the slope
moving with her as she scrambles half dragging kyle through a row of trees at a chainlink retaining fence
she crawls under the fence tugs kyle and the satchel through after
sarah looks up at the source of a sudden thunderous roar
it appears above them grinding over the embankment
it rolls down the steep slope toward camera flattening trees
sarah and kyle scramble up and run across the storage lot of a modern factory complex of low buildings
kyle struggles to keep up holding the satchel
like a juggernaut the truck follows smashing through parked cars and flattening a pre fab storage building
they enter an alley like space between two buildings
kyle is fumbling to open the satchel
angle back as the tanker enters the alley
it tears the corner off one building as it turns in
terminator looks down from his mountain of steel
over terminators shoulder looking down at a tiny figure below running in the headlights glare
it is sarah alone
reese crouches in a trash dumpster which is sandwiched between the wall and the tanker
there are only inches of clearance as the trailers pass by
he lights a pipe charge jumps up and wedges it under the tank cylinder of the second trailer
he ducks as it rolls on
sarah is stumbling in the glare of the trucks lights
pipe bomb the fuse burning
terminator through the windshield his eye glowing
reese huddles in the dumpster
the rear trailer explodes
an unbelievable fireball erupts skyward silhouetting sarahs running figure f
the dumpster is enveloped by fire and hurled rolling down the alley
sarah makes it around a corner as the forward trailer explodes and an ocean of flame rolls forward blasting by her
the dumpster topples and kyle rolls out surrounded by fire
in the center of the inferno terminator struggles violently
his flesh fires and sizzles
he tears loose from the twisted wreckage and collapses to the ground
sinks into a charred mass
terminator mouth open skull like motionless in the flames
sarah crawls away from the intense heat and lies watching the motionless figure in the blaze
sarah rounds the corner staggering searching
she sees kyle crumpled face down near the dumpster sheltered from the heat by its mass
she drags his away
rolls him over
reese his head lolls
he opens his eyes weakly sarah
we did it kyle
we got it
she hugs him
they hold the embrace silhouetted by the diminishing flames
it would be a wonderful final image
terminator staggers out of the blaze behind them
terminator the last flakes of flesh are falling from him like burning leaves
his gleaming structure is revealed in all its intricacy
no longer a he but an it
it looks like death rendered in steel
a chrome skeleton with hydraulic muscles and tendons of flexible cable
in the sockets of the metal skull the eyeball swivels with a whir of tiny servos both glowing red now
it turns slowly and fixes its gaze directly into camera
sarah she chokes on a scream crams knuckles in her mouth
full shot fx as the machine takes a step toward them dragging one malfunctioning leg
panaglide with kyle and sarah as they stagger to their feet and run to the nearest building
they come to a glass door
kyle kicks it in
they enter dark offices to the sound of alarms and distant sirens
sarah and kyle run down a corridor
through a door which they close and lock
they move off down a cross corridor
the terminator blasts the door off its hinges f
and staggers through
it starts after their receding figures as they round the corner at the end of the hall
wracked exhausted they stumble through a maze of parti the terminator catches sight of them through a floor to ceiling window
it makes an unhesitating right turn through the glass
sarah and kyle look back at the sound of shattering glass
panaglide preceding the terminator as it crashes forward line of sight through the maze
it splinters partitions
flings desks out of the way
following sarah and kyle as they reach a heavy firedoor and go through
kyle slides the bolts on the metal firedoor
behind them are acres of machinery in darkness
the terminator hits the door from the far side
kyle goes to a large breaker panel and opens it
starts throwing switches
behind them machines start up one by one
panting what are you doing
he sags sliding down the wall
she pulls him up
half carries him into the maze of machines
the dark gallery is filled with whirring clanking shapes shattering conveyer belts and improbable mechanisms lashing mindlessly
reese slips to the floor and sarah is no longer able to support him
faintly leave me here
sarah crouches beside him
grabs his shirt front
yells over the machines
im not leaving you anywhere you jerk
havent you figured it out
kyle john is our son
reeses eyes refocus
continuing there isnt going to be anybody else
i dont want anybody else
listen to me
she pauses then resumes in a commanding military shout
move you ass
she drags him to his feet and he staggers on
hinges shatter and the firedoor is hurled inward
the terminator scans the darkness
angle panning with sarah and kyle as they move through the machines
the cyborg steps forward scanning methodically
sarah and kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous tangle of pipes and machinery
kyle picks up a length of pipe to use as a weapon
as they climb out onto a cat walk between the two huge mechanisms sarah clambers over an innocuous control panel
her knee inadvertently hits a red push button
with a roar the stamping plate of a hydraulic press slams down an inch from her hand
startled she tumbles to the catwalk
the terminators eyes swivel as he hears the single non rhythmic sound
kyle and sarah run to the end of the catwalk but find the door there locked
they double back to escape the cul de sac
the terminator steps in front of them cutting them off
he pushes sarah roughly and she stumbles away
kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the terminator advances
over his shoulder run damn it
she hesitates backing away
the cyborg swings at reese kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back
angle on catwalk as kyle lands in a heap smashed against a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to the factory floor twenty feet below
sarah turns and runs
low angle past reese f
as the cyborg approaches him
kyles face streaked with blood pressed to the floor as a metal foot clangs down f
his eyes snap open
sarah falls gets up runs on
the terminator draws back for a death blow
and kyle rolls with the last of his strength raising the pipe bomb he has been cradling
he jams it between two hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborgs armored rib cage
then rolls off the catwalk
terminator has an instant to react reaching for the bomb before it explodes
sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the floor
slams up against one wall
a withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her
pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory rain ing down
sarah very still
she winces and opens her eyes
slowly looks up
pov sarah as the smoke clears
the terminator is gone
unrecognizable clumps of burning debris lie scattered about
looking down through the grating floor she sees kyles body
low angle on kyle f
sarah on catwalk above
kyles eyes are half open
his face peaceful
angle on one of the fires climbing some plastic tubing and triggering a sprinkler head
it begins to rain
sarah sitting up as the water runs over her
she looks down
protruding from her right thigh is a twisted piece of metal
part of the cyborg
she pulls it out grimacing
her leg is broken
it is a long time before she can gather the will to move
sarahs pov she sees a wall phone several yards away beyond the debris from the explosion
she starts to crawl toward it
she passes a large clump of debris f
angle on debris fx as it rolls over suddenly
now recognizable as the terminators head and arms with half of the scattered torso trailing wires and twisted metal
sarah wants to scream this time from the depths of her soul but there is no scream only a dry shivering sob
the terminator drags itself scraping over the floor steel fingers clutching
sarah is shaking and whimpering as she scrabbles away crawling in agony
angle on conveyor belt as sarah flops from the catwalk onto the moving strip
she is carried into the intricate lattice of equipment
sarah rolls off weakly before going under a set of sorting rollers
angle through machinery on the terminator fx as it crawls after her dragging its body
it tracks her unerringly sarah moves deeper into the dark clashing jungle of machinery
around her is a rain drenched tangle of cables pipes and unforgiving mechanisms of steel
the terminator clambers through after her
sarah water pours into her eyes as she catches sight of something
a familiar control box
she drags herself toward it
the terminator fx it spots her wedged in a tiny crawl space
no way out
it crawls the last few feet eyes red in the dark
hypnotized sarah watches the terminator reaching toward her
she is jammed in a corner
sarahs hand claws around to the front of the control panel seeking the red button
angle on the terminator fx his steel hand reaching out
sarah her face inexplicably calm eyes steady in that infinite instant
she clenches her teeth to keep from screaming as she waits
the terminators hand reaches for her throat to crush the life out of her and end its long mission
voice icy youre
button as her bloody finger stabs it down
full shot showing how the cyborg has been led into the tons of mechanical pressure flatten the terminators head and body like tin foil
the press screams jamming solid
lightning snaps out in one brief blaze leaping to surround ing machinery arcing to sarahs wristwatch
all the terminators energy is released in one second
angle on the narrow gap between the upper and lower plates a pinpoint of red light dwindles and goes out
tight on sarah shivering uncontrollably
the steel fingers are frozen an inch from her throat
she can only stare as water runs over her
close on the side rail of an ambulance gurney snapping up into position
sarahs eyes are closed and she is moved wide shot showing the gurney being rolled by two attendants past the site of the last explosion
several police officers are picking through the debris
panning with the gurney as it is wheeled out holding on one the plant manager bends to examine a piece of the cyborg lying at the base of the hydraulic
a cop b
look i told you not to touch anything until were done
you got that
sure thing officer
he stands and palms a small object to his assistant
they step around the corner
what is it
but ive never seen stuff like this anywhere
jap stuff maybe
keep it out of sight and get it down to r and d monday first thing
sarah is being lifted into the ambulance
she looks up as the doors are latched shut
tilt up to follow her gaze
the sign above the entrance of the building reads macro on cassette recorder the center capstans of a tape turning
and the hardest thing is deciding what i should tell you and what not to
well anyway ive got a while yet before youre old enough to understand the tapes
theyre more for me at this point
to help get it all straight
cover shot reveals sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station
all of its signs are in hand lettered spanish
beyond lies an expanse of scrub desert
the sky scowls with an impending storm
sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark complected attendant laconically fills her tank
she cradles the cassette recorder in her lap in the lee of her swollen belly
she looks to be about six months along
under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster and the butt of a
revolver presses against her breast
she tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances her way
a german shepherd sits in the back among taped boxes and suitcases
continuing should i tell you about your father
thats a tough one
will it change your decision to send him here
but if you dont send kyle you could never be
god you can go crazy thinking about all this
i suppose ill tell you
i owe him that
and maybe itll be enough if you know that in the few hours we had together we loved a lifetimes worth
sarah jumps at a sound nearby breaking her reverie
a small mexican boy has snapped her picture with a beat up polaroid camera
he holds it out to her speaking rapid spanish
he says you are very beautiful senora and he is ashamed to ask five american dollars for this picture but if he does not his father will beat him
thats a pretty good hustle kid
the boy takes her four dollars and she watches the snapshot develop
it is a good photograph of her the wind lightly ruffling her hair expression thought ful slightly sad
we recognize it as the one reese carried in
she slips it into her short pocket
fifteen dollars american
as she pays him distant thunder rolls
the boy yells something in spanish as he runs off
what did he say
accented there is a storm coming in
sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the desert
heat lightning pulses in their depths
quietly i know
camera cranes up as she pulls away driving across the flat desert on a ribbon of highway
a brilliant flash crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the world
