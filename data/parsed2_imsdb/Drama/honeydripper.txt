written by john sayles we hear a strange single bent note
we follow a small boys fingers on a strange contraption scratch years old has a diddley bow a piece of baling wire nailed to the side of the unpainted shack
so it is stretched taut
he moves an old corn cob under it as a fret and makes twangy pitch shifting notes as he plucks the wire
his friend lonnie stands moving his fingers over a board he has laid on the side of the porch floor
a few scrawny chickens run around in the yard behind them leave off with that scratch
aint bothering you
yes it is
that aint no kind of music
we see that the board has piano keys drawn across it and that lonnie is pretending to play a song on it least i make a sound
yeah and its a nasty one
lonnie looks at the sky you want to try again tonight
lonnie sits on the edge of the porch gauging the time from the setting sun might as well
slide guitar plays
a tuft of raw cotton bobs on the stem and we begin to scroll opening credits
we tilt and rack to look over a field of cotton the bolls plumped out and ready for picking blowing in the breeze
a harvest hand steps into the shot looks toward the setting sun wipes his face with a bandanna then stoops to pick the row in front of him
we pull back to see other pickers men and women in denim coveralls old gingham dresses and hard work shoes wearing straw hats against the sun and trailing long white
sacks between their legs and behind them
the boys walk down between them in the opposite direction music continues
we see the boys walking on a path through the pines music continues
we float over railroad tracks cutting through flat piney woods catching up the boys who walk on the ties music continues
the boys stroll past white buildings of an army barracks
soldiers black and white drill on the grounds the river rolls past us in the fg as the boys cross a railroad bridge
we superimpose we hear piano music as we crane down toward the honeydripper lounge a ramshackle wooden roadhouse at a rural crossroads
blue colored light bulbs a few broken flick on and off erratically around the honeydripper sign as we track toward and then through it on the way to the entrance
catching up with lonnie and scratch
the boys step under the door light frantic with insects and go up on their toes to peek in through a window an overhead angle of long fingers on piano
keys a woman in her late s early s bertha mae spivey leans into a microphone from where she sits on a stool on a little makeshift stage a glass of whiskey in hand and sings i know a gal name of betty sue shook it so much she got the german flu no matter how she done it no matter how she done it no matter how she done it she done it just the same as she sings we pan and track moving through the large near empty country roadhouse you women dont worry about your life she made jack the ripper throw away his knife only a few die hard regulars are scattered at the tables and bar stools
a pretty young woman in her late teens china doll is behind the bar head held in her hands listening aimlessly
no matter how she done it no matter how she done it no matter how she done it she done it just the same lonnie and scratch step in cautiously
looking around hoping that nobody will notice and tell them to leave
they plant themselves next to the piano lonnie intently watching the long fingers work the keys we tilt to see tyrone pinetop purvis proprietor and piano player in his s
he acts as if the boys arent there concentrating on the music
we shift to include bertha mae as she wraps up the song a copper brought her in she didnt need no bail she shook it for the judge he threw
the cop in jail no matter how she done it no matter how she done it no matter how she done it she done it just the same slick a pretty sharply dressed man in his late s at the bar and maceo who sits at a table near the bandstand smiling throughout applaud
the sound makes the room seem more empty
ty stands nods to metalmouth sims a slight worried looking harmonica player who sits behind bertha mae you take it for a while
as ty crosses to the bar we hear recorded music booming from outside they makin all that racket again at toussaints
and all them people over there buying drinks and throwing their money after them dice and whatnot
lucky we got none a that here
metalmouth launches into a harmonica intro
ty pauses at the counter next to slick who is attentively watching bertha mae you can drink your liquor you can drink your cold can beer she sounding good huh
you can drink your good whiskey you can drink your cold can beer not much of a crowd
not a crowd at all
just some stiffs who want to drink theirself to sleep without the music wakin em up

china doll brings ty a glass of whiskey
he gives her a sad smile thanks china doll
we follow as ty crosses to the door
dont see why we dont just turn our box on and let folks feed it nickels like they do
the lady is singing
but didnt nobody come to listen to her slick
ty looks out the door at the red lit ace of spades club across the road people hanging out in front laughter heard from within ty reacts
behind him maceo indicates the near empty room like the man say you cant argue with failure
stokely a bitter drunk who holds on to the end of the bar calls out to them you know why slick here is like a preacher
slick tenses used to this cause he does all his best work on his knees
stokely almost chokes with laughter never mind him he just a drunk i hear she put a ring through it and use it to yank him around the house
slick starts to rise but maceo puts a hand on his arm
you know tyrone dont allow no scufflin here slick
i oughta get me a old woman too take care of the groceries
just got to sweet talk her some give her a good poke now and then you gonna drink stokely or you gonna lay out back recoverin from that busted head

she is dressed for church doffs his hat miss delilah lets behave ourselves

china doll mopes as she steps out from behind you bring people their food

maceo gets behind the counter as delilah heads for ty at the door at pinetops honeydripper thats where i get my cold can beer at pinetops honeydripper thats where i
get my cold can beer maceo reluctantly moves down to take the order of nadine a large handsome woman with a prominent gold tooth who has just stepped in evenin maceo

flirting you know what you can do for me sweet man
maceo tries to slip the hook and be polite at the same time what would you like to drink
ty watches the crowd in front of the ace of spades
delilah comes up to join him indicates his drink how many is that tonight
dont dog me about that baby
i dont want china doll behind that bar
she got to help out
not there she doesnt
you know shes not sposed to get excited not much chance of that in here
wistful harvest hands all been crowdin into toussaints place
the young ones

they stick their noses in here get one little sniff of the music and they gone
joking maybe thats the wages of sin
bitter aint no sin happenin here tonight baby and there sure as hell aint no wages
your god wants to chastise some sinners he best move on over to toussaints got a whole barroom crowded with em
he isnt my god
hes everybodys god
he looks at his wife how that tent meeting went tonight
viola underwood found the lord
i thought she found him last year when they come through
smiles well she must have lost him again between then and now cause she come down that aisle tonight hollering in tongues
the spirit didnt move you though
thoughtful not yet
might be too late for me
delilah surveys the room i cant believe youre serving alton stokely
stokely has to use two hands to keeps his glass steady as he drinks that poor man toussaint cut his credit off
either he gets it here or he drinks that paint peeler willie pettigrew cooks up back in the swamp
hes gonna drink himself to death in here
least he wont go blind first
delilah shakes her head and heads out the door imonna go home and say a prayer for that man
calling after say one for me too baby
bertha mae is singing straight to slick now as metalmouth backs her up on the harmonica come here sweet poppa let me whisper in your ear come here sweet poppa
let me whisper in your ear go back to alabama but dont you leave your momma here only slick applauds that was outstandin baby
you still got the voice
bertha mae a little unsteady holds onto slicks arm as he helps her off the stage you think so
sent a chill down my spine to hear you
bertha mae looks to ty as he steps back in i might be a little late saturday tyrone
mutters embarrassed dont need to come in if you dont want to
she stops dead
stares at him till he has to let it out ive made other arrangements
try something new in here
you cant do that
its his place darlin he can do whatever he want
bertha mae nods to ty holding onto her dignity for all its worth you know where to find me if you need me
bertha mae pulls slick out the door
china doll watches after them troubled while ty pours himself another drink softly i put the box on now ty
put the box on
imonna crank it up some see if we can draw a little life in here maceo crosses and plugs an ancient looking tabletop jukebox in
the jukebox sputters to life lights flashing on and music blaring for a moment then the lights flicker and all the power in the club goes off
the honeydripper sign is the last to flicker and die
lonnie and scratch watch from under the streetlight there it go again
lectricity dont like that jukebox
a match is struck flares as china doll lights a kerosene lamp shes pulled from under the bar got to get the power company in here no you dont
they turned my juice off last month dont want them sniffin around that splice job maceo done
must be a short circuit in the juke here he yanks the plug out of the wall as ty steps up to reassure the few patrons dont worry folks bars
its nice like this
kind of romantic
imonna have to go out back wiggle some things around
dont be wigglin nothin round less im there to see it
maceo rolls his eyes as he passes ty on the way out with a flashlight
he freezes in his tracks as the flashlight beam hits a figure standing in the doorway it is sheriff hiram pugh large and in charge
pugh strolls into the club as if he owns it
sheriff pugh looks around the near empty club your lights gone out
looks like it
dont know but that be a vilation of somethin or other
ty has played this game before trying to hold his ground without pissing off the white man with the badge we just about to close up here
pugh sniffs the air your wife been cookin
went to the revival tent
grins i stood by there a while
them nigras was singin up a storm
ty doesnt respond
sheriff pugh stops right next to stokely giving him a dead pan stare as he speaks
stokely wont meet his eyes i just come out here to look in on toussaint had that shooting two nights ago
lots of fighting in there
there is that
but me and old toussaint got us a greement
sheriff pugh contd you get these field hands suckin down that whiskey hop em all up with music theres gonna be some razors drawn
he only call me if its a fatality
never been a killin in here
them youngbloods know better than to mess with tyrone purvis
he turns his attention to tyrone you got quite the reputation round here tyrone
say you put some poor black boy in the grave
it gets very quiet the hiss of the kerosene lantern growing tense and insistent
china doll looks from sheriff pugh to tys face searching for a flicker of evidence
ty stays deadpan just people talkin
the sheriff steps to put his face very close to tys an edge of menace in his voice when he speaks softly you remember that this is my county tyrone
what goes on goes on cause i let it
dont want to get too big for your britches out here
ty holds pughs eyes for an agonizingly long moment then the sheriff turns and heads for the door you folks have a pleasant evening now
they all wait for him to clear the door before they exhale
a nigger aint shit in this world
maceo snatches the whiskey bottle from stokely
speakin for yourself
you didnt have this club tyrone what you think you be
we tighten on tys face
he has been thinking about this very thing wouldnt be nothin
and if that aint true then grits aint groceries
a long train whistle echoes outside bertha mae pauses as she climbs the front porch of her two story wooden house the nicest in the neighborhood listening to the train
whistle with a troubled look on her face
slick waits for her with the door open that is a terrible noise
just the northbound from talledega
sounds like it always does
like a soul bein carried away from this life
come on in darlin
you catch your death out here
we hear the train whistle again as the wheels roll and the train strobes past us picking up speed as it pulls out from the yard when it clears we
see a lone figure standing across the tracks
he steps forward and catches a bit of light
sonny blake s rumpled from hard travelling
he carries a guitar case and something bulky in a sack shack thomas an older man in a pullman porters uniform stands under the moth addled light on the tiny
station platform watching sonny lucky the high sheriff aint here to see you crawl outta that boxcar
he come round here much
only when hes bored
sonny reaches shack at the platform you working that train
kansas city to new orleans
what you get off here for
i growed up here

shrugs got tired of sleepin in a boxcar
listen is there a place to points switchmans shed right over there has got a cot

sonny looks at the shed unenthusiastic you get into town tomorrow an need somethin tell em shack thomas sent you
they know who you talkin about
hey whats the name of this town
shack points to the sign hanging down from the lip of the platform roof the sign reads name like that must be a good place for musicians
shack laughs as he heads away only night i ever spent in jail was a town called liberty
sun comes up youll see where you landed
and you best be out of that shed by first light
a few wet crumpled bills and dirty coins are spread out on the bartop its just a weekday night still operating by lantern light ty and maceo look at the
nights dismal take as china doll lays chairs on top of tables i owe the chicken man i owe the ice man i owe the liquor man least you dont owe the electric company
indicates the dark room yeah thats a big relief
worried you thinkin bout closing down
ty frowns reaches under the counter and brings up a poster
he spreads it out on the counter top
it reads new orleans singing sensation what you think
biggest act in new orleans got him a hit on the radio hes playing here saturday night
figured id wait till bertha mae was gone to put this up
ty turns to look for the right spot to fix the poster here
you mean like in this room here
you know the tomcat club in texarkana
big jim jamisons place just went out of business
damn and since sam is giggin his way over to tulsa that means he got the date open
but you aint never had a guitar pl ty gives maceo a warning look which china doll notes im having one now
what you gonna pay the man with
ty glances at china doll uneasy you just worry about gettin these hung up everywhere in the county tomorrow
payday come saturday he gonna draw alla them cotton pickers and soldiers boys in here get us back in the black
ty looks around at the empty club they gonna take me down it wont be without a fight
maceo holds the poster up to the lamplight warming to the idea guitar sam at the honeydripper
man this joint is going to jump
an old man in coveralls leads a mule along the side of the road
a truck carrying two dozen pickers in its open bed approaches one of the pickers dex turns to look back at the man and mule aint seen no mule in
a long time
the other pickers men and women dont look interested or even fully awake yet
i knew this was alabama but thats the stone ages man
one of the other men ham looks him over
dex is little and combative and has a nasty looking scar on his face
ham is big and morose with a deep grumpy voice where you from boy
down on you vacation
a few snickers got in a piece of trouble up there with the white folks need to bide my time for a spell
junebug a local man with a nervous air jumps in you bide any time in these fields bossman gonna fire your ass for takin up space
aint no worry bout that
im a cotton pickin fool
you a fool all right
more snickers and the truck stops at the side of a cotton field
somebody lets the tailgate down and they begin to climb off and where you from brother bear
then this a real step up for you
folks round here has discovered fire and whatnot
that trouble you in have anything to do with runnin your mouth
the pickers unroll the sacks they pick up from the pile thats been left and begin to spread out at the base of the unpicked rows had to do with
somebody get on my nerves and i had to deal with him
must of been somebody kind of puny
dex turns to face the much larger ham as i recall he just about your size
the two men stare at each other for a long moment
way too early to fight
dex breaks eye contact and moves toward a row whats this place we at
nearest town is harmony
silas tugwells place
he nods toward dexs row you better get pickin
cotton aint goin nowhere
more you get first thing when the dew still on it the more it weighs when it tip that scale
dexs gaze falls upon a tall strong looking young woman starting down the row next to his you live here too
she gives him a weary look
shakes his head you got my sympathies
a wide shot of the tracks that cut the town in two
sonny stands on the tracks just as the sun rises pondering which side of the tracks is for white people which for the colored
he hears guitar music to one side steps cautiously toward it sonny wanders down the street lugging his sack and case moving toward the sound of a slide guitar being
played expertly an irate looking white lady glares at sonny as she picks up the milk bottles from her stoop steps inside and slams the door
sonny moves ahead uneasy we tighten on his face as he stops to listen the music echoing seeming to come from here then from there then suddenly from right behind
him he turns possum blind with his chair tilted back against the not yet open general store plays expertly on a beat up old guitar
sonny lays his case down to listen for a moment watching the mans fingers possum gets a whiff of him
he keeps playing as he speaks somebody slept in the railroad yard
sonny watches the blind mans fingers move on the strings yall can play that thing
been doin it near forever
looking around listen which side of the tracks am i the wrong side for you
what you doing here then
white folks look right through me
how much mischief an old blind spook like me gonna get up to anyhow
sonny surveys the street where our people go for music around here
theres a couple places just a little bit out of town
at the crossroads
you in a hurry
possum finishes his song how old is that box you playin pops
smiles second one that ever was an the devils got the first
how bout yours
possum gently nudges sonnys case with his toe
sonny is surprised at the blind mans perception brand new
made it myself
whistles made it hisself
so these clubs old toussaint owns the ace of spades dont feature live music
and pinetop purvis owns the honeydripper lounge
he dont care bout no guitar
wont have one under his roof
that dont make sense
possum scratches his head yeah when a musician put his hand to murder nine times outa ten its a drummer done it
but pinetop a piano man he killed somebody
thats the story
might be true and it might not
ty is tacking one of the guitar sam posters on the front of the building
but if you meet the man you damn well dont be askin him about it
a crackle and a curse from the side of the roadhouse damn
ty looks up whats the matter
i got a shock
thought you used to work for the power company
maceo wrestles with the jury rigged wires that run out from the battered rusting power box i drove a supply truck
guitar sam aint gonna play by no candlelight
sniffs i smell bacon
you must of burnt your porky ass with that lectricity
china doll has stepped out from the club wheres your mama
already over to the mayors
she told me to come here and make sure you eat something fore you start runnin around
maceo comes around from the side that is a sweet woman you got
you got one waitin for you if you want her
maceo makes a face
you mean nadine
they step into the club
plates of bacon eggs and biscuits sit on one of the tables teasing come in here every night makin them cow eyes at you ty and maceo sit she seems
like the kind could smother a man she makes all her own clothes
smiles darlin thats not the kind of thing a man cares about from a woman
the lights that went out last night suddenly flicker on hey i fixed it
you didnt do no such thing
it just decided to come back on
just like it decided to switch off last night
you not even in the conversation
miss nadine makes some good money too sewing for people
that woman scares me

maceo contd she cook for him fixed him up all kinds of nice new clothes kept him in gin and poker chips dont see no problem with that
well come four five months a man starts to sorry china doll but this just the way it is a man gots needs
nadine look like she can take care of those too you eat chicken every morning noon and night for five months you get a taste for some different kind of
looks to china doll maybe i shouldnt be aint gonna tell me something i havent heard worse
well nappy goes out and has him a a porkchop or two lets say and he comes back from toussaints one night feeling no pain smelling like like porkchops the
way a man will and he falls out on nadines couch and commences to snore
wake up the next mornin finds she had took all his clothes off without him knowin it man was dog drunk miss nadine come in with a skillet in her
hand hot grits bubbling in it says baby i got your breakfast
not this morning nadine he says sittin up dont think i could eat a thing
well then she says we cant let this go to waste can we
and she dump that whole hot bubblin mess right in the mans lap
then she got busy with that hot iron on his head
screams didnt bring the neighbors in she would of killed that man
they are all quiet for a moment contemplating you got to admit it though woman is an artist with that singer machine
they turn to see sonny standing in the doorway which one of you is mr
tys eyes fix on sonnys face for a moment something familiar there then go down to the guitar case at his feet we aint hirin
i can play anything ty indicates the guitar sam poster hanging behind the bar already got me a professional
sonny looks a little shaky guitar sam really coming all the way out here

sonny has to think to china doll take him back and fix him somethin china doll

ty grows somber reminiscing i was out there ridin them rails between the wars
seem like half the country headin west rolled past the other half comin back east
musing every one of us scrapin for the next meal this is the place
they turn to see cool breeze a hard looking sharply dressed character leading the prosperous looking mr
simmons into the club as if they arent there
yall can tear things down put things up got a lot of potential
looks bigger in here than it does from the outside
i help you gentlemen

ty and maceo wait till the men are gone before they speak we cleared over two hundred that one weekend couple years back and we didnt have no louisiana guitar
wizard playin neither
yeah they say he draws em like flies
thats what they say
an awkward pause
both men are shaken
ty sits back down to think they say first thing he does is go to the man that owns the joint sticks out his hand and wants that cash money
put in it
i already sent fifty to his manager
how much you payin him all out
wed have to clear three hundred i figure we charge folks two dollars to get in then drinks
shakes his head what im sayin is less he sees the green up front the man wont get off the train
a truck horn honks outside whats that now
ty mind working looks desperate as maceo exits to see whos honking a battered truck sits in front of the club
zeke a taciturn white man and his black loader step out as maceo approaches calls out bout time you fellas run by
we just about dry here
the loader lets down the tailgate to reveal cases of beer and liquor
he begins to pull them out and pile them on the ground your boss in
maceo shouts back into the club tyrone

zeke steps in and slams the door the loader doing the same on the other side of him ill pay you extra penny a bottle on the beer and a

the truck engine coughs desperate what if i throw in five dollars up front just for you fellas
zeke pulls away

but the truck is gone down the road
maceo comes up beside ty watching forlornly maybe we could buy some busthead from willie pettigrew
with that sheriff sniffin around every night

another truck pulls around the bend from the opposite direction then what we gonna do
the new truck slows to a stop by them
the driver pokes his head out got a liquor delivery for a mr

ty glances over to the ace of spades then points behind the honeydripper pull it around to the back well help you unload
the driver nods and wheels the truck past them
maceos smile fades and he looks to ty man this better be some saturday night
a little kitchen built onto the back of the bar
sonny sits wolfing down eggs and toast as china doll watches him from the stove arkansas

ty gives sonny a distrustful look and you young man want to point yourself west down that highway
bout three miles you see a mess of people working in the fields its harvest time
if you can stoop and pull they got a job for you
he steps out the back door and wash up them dishes before you go
delilah is washing breakfast dishes singing a gospel song as she works i see four and twenty elders down on their knees i see four and twenty elders down on
their knees well they all turn together standing to greet the rising sun i see four and twenty elders down on their knees amanda winship the mayors pretty high strung wife enters and hovers uneasily your biscuits were wonderful this morning delilah

delilah isnt surprised by the response you just say the word miss amanda i have you cookin in no time
amanda nods uncomfortable but not leaving

ty maceo and china doll approach the general store
a white couple enter from the front what i need is for you to go get friendly with luther then i just happen in we cant just ask mr
skinner dont want nothin from colored folks but they buy his goods and shine his shoes

bark ty turns how did possum get there chair and all
stackolee an billy lyons was squabblin in the dark ty frowns at the lyrics stackolee said to billy lyons what you think bout that

china doll pushes the front door all the way open
we can hear bertha maes voice singing on a scratchy old record

slick sitting at the bottom of the stairs that lead to the second floor looking lost and bewildered shes gone
he was all geared up for the siege when she gonna be back

china doll and ty trade a look we start on the record player needle down on the spinning song then rack to see bertha mae laying dead in her bed

eyes fixed straight ahead
we he gets even with the car we see sheriff pugh sitting in the drivers seat watching him in a hurry boy

stranger wanderin around no job that would make you a vagrant

sonny doesnt even think about running away
black prison laborers pick cotton watched over by an armed i can always use another hand

gawkery with intent to mope

a white lieutenant passes giving maceo a dark look
maceo salutes afternoon sir

delilah sits at the dining room table with a sandwich shes made herself
we hear perry como on a record somewhere in the house
she hasnt gotten two bites down before amanda wanders in crossing to the liquor cabinet oh dear i believe its about that time she pulls out a decanter of wine
would you care to join me
no thank you
amanda pours herself a glass of wine of course you wont join me you dont partake
that was thoughtless of me
thats all right
so you dont take spirits and what else
in your church
im sort of between churches right now
i been thinking about changing over to the holiness but i i havent been sanctified yet
ah theres been a minister in this week the tent out by the fairgrounds
amanda takes a drink the church i grew up in we were pentacostals they wouldnt have anything but the human voice inside the church
and dancing any kind of dancing music card playing well it was very strict
they took up serpents
ive heard of that
i tell floyd these stories and hes horrified
theyve always been methodists floyds family
theyre good people too
when i married floyd oh it was quite a scandal among my relatives
as if id taken up with somebody in a cult
it can be a trial married folks differ in their religion
and your husband is a
he has his social club the honeydripper
such a colorful name
he must devote a great deal of his energy to it
its just him and maceo green runs it and then i go over and cook some when i get off here
thats very supportive of you
considering the sort of environment defensive i been in those barrooms most of my life miss amanda
amanda realizes she has probed too deep tries to back up i see i was a singer
i met tyrone in the paradise down in shreveport china doll was only two delilah considers struggling to express who ty is
i was just kind of livin along you know drinking more than i ought then tyrone
it was like a light come into my life
delilah turns away embarrassed to have revealed so much people think things because he owns the lounge but they dont know him
small minds are never in short supply
she crosses to look out a window the people in this town she catches herself smiles i suppose they expected that floyd being from a prominent family as prominent as
is possible here in harmony would have chosen somebody more she fades away again empties her glass my people were very devout but they werent financially successful
no shame in that
in school if you didnt have shoes she frowns at the memory sighs oh i forgot amanda is up and out of the room
delilah frowns at the decanter hurries to put it away
amanda comes back in holding a dress for a young girl
i was going through emilys old things the other day and i thought this would look just darling on your china doll delilah examines the dress which is clearly for
a little girl oh i dont think it would near fit her miss amanda
disappointed how old is she now
shocked oh my i must have lost track somewhere along the line
she sits still holding the dress sneaks a look over to where the wine decanter was it was a very nice thought
an awkward silence that perry como fills inadequately
a knock at the back door then china doll steps in not seeing amanda right away mama
they need you at delilah shifts her eyes to indicate oh im sorry miss amanda
i didnt know you was home
smiles china doll
we were just recalling you used to play right here under this table
ty sits staring mind working overtime staring at the dead woman on the bed
he barely hears slick talking to the undertaker behind him busy filling out forms there isnt any cash money i know of
she sold a good deal of the furniture but theres still a nice lookin sofa in the parlor
only thing she cared for anymore was singin out to pinetops place ty looks at a large ring on berthas maes cold gray hand
he touches it with a finger you welcome to look around the house if theres anything your missus might like long as its not something personal to me and bertha
mae ty draws his finger away from the ring as if burnt its just she got to go out in style is what it is
the best you got all the trimmins lay it out for her
thats the way she lived it thats the way she ought to leave it
ty closes his eyes and buries his head in his hands blazing hot
cotton chaff in the air as the prison work gang bend to their task dragging long sacks behind them like snakes
even the deputies are sweating rivulets as they stand by with their shotguns in hand
sonny is way behind the others not dressed for the work wincing as he pricks his fingers for the umpteenth time
ned a little prisoner picking his way back in the opposite direction in a parallel row takes pity on him yall never done this job before
cant say i have
you want to set your pins out wide bend over from the hip sonny widens his stance and dont be bobbin up and down all the time
when you up be up but when you on the row stay down
sonny digs in and keeps low but most important you got to get you a rhythm
everything in this life got a rhythm to it even pullin cotton off the plant

ned cackles then i suggest you work that into your rhythm too
a deputy calls out
lets see more pickin and less talkin over there
gettin right on it boss
ned picks his way behind sonny
sonny starts to rock slightly looking for a rhythm of movement he can maintain the free pickers sit on and around the truck that brought them eating lunch
dex watches the prison laborers across the road as he shuffles a battered deck of cards sitting with a couple of the other men them boys fryin over there
that judge gatlins gang he work them people from can until cant ever damn day and when his fields is picked he bid em out to the neighbors
harvest time comes round here you sign up with somebody fast or you stay outa sight
dex waves flies away from his face spits ate a peck of dust today

smiles aint enough whiskey in this world wash out what i swallowed in my life
dex riffles the cards what we playin for
two bits a hand

i caught a winnin streak that cleaned out half the sportin men on beale street
got up from that table my money was as long as train smoke what happen to it
dex raises his voice so the woman he checked out in the morning can hear spent it all on fine lookin women
he calls to where ham stands in knee high grass a heavy stick in his hand staring intently at the ground yo missippi his name hamilton

he raises a matchstick in his fingers settle up on payday

dex stops dealing to stare at ham insulted you sinuatin

he brings his stick down hard
he pulls up a rabbit dead by its hind legs looks like dinner
rabbit is a rodent

dex snorts disgusted then finishes dealing
he lays the top card face up and slaps down the rest of the deck mutters simple country nigger fraid to sit down an lose his little handful of change

the show we puttin on at the honeydripper saturday night
a very modest wooden house with a porch
lights on inside ty and china doll sit as delilah lays dinner on the table
she is dressed to go out i expect therell be a nice turnout for bertha mae tomorrow
folks who wouldnt have nothin to do with her when she was alive
some of them maybe
you still got to pay your respects
slick gonna have to find him a new ride
thats a terrible thing to say thats how the man gets over is all sugarin up to some woman got a job or a bankroll its no way to live
just how it is out in the world baby man got to walk through the gates of hell to get a piece of cheese
he stares moodily unnoticing as she lays his plate in front of him youre not so young any more lose hold of what little you got he just shakes his
if you lose the club im sure youll find something else
in this town
delilah proceeds cautiously you know anytime you want i could get miss amanda to ask her husb watch yo feet mr
mayor i done just mopped the flo
delilah tries to ignore this you work so hard at the lounge and what it brings in isnt even as much as what you make polishin that white ladys silver
i didnt say that

delilah gives up knowing hes set on his mood itll just have to work out then
a strained silence
delilah crosses to the back door meetin gonna start without im there
your soul not the one needs savin baby
she gives ty a lost look steps out
the screen door slams
china doll sees how worried ty is
its all gonna be fine daddy
everbody in town talkin bout guitar sam comin to harmony
a choir sings at the front of the lantern lit tent a congregation of salvation seekers filling the benches mother died yes she died and left me it was long
long time ago oh but i searched searched her record over i found mother just had to go oh she cried son son dont you worry oh you know the lord always fix a way delilah arrives at the rear of the tent finds herself a spot on a bench she left me standing standing along the highway oh wondering which way i must go
reverend cutlip watches his singers clapping out time with his big hands as i walked all along the highway i was seeking my lord each day she left me standing
standing along the highway just wondering which way must i go
amens and other sounds greet the end of the song
reverend cutlip steps to the center of the platform and looks around at the souls gathered
the highway of life brothers and sisters will twist you and turn you it will run you this way and that way it will tempt you with many a detour
for the highway of life brothers and sisters is designed to lead us astray
he gets an amen
from someone in the crowd it meanders away from the light and into the darkness it tires our legs and whittles away at our spirits
the congregation start to get into it responding rocking with the rhythm of the sermon flapping their paper fans that advertise beauchamps funeral home in the hot night it snares
us with the thorns and thistles of wickedness it is paved with the black deeds of sinners and laid out on a crooked plan
thats not the road we want to be on brothers and sisters thats not the path we need to follow
the reverend picks up speed we got to get on that other road
the one that leads to salvation
the one that leads to glory
the one that leads to the right hand of god
praise his name
praise the lord
the thoroughfare im talking about the righteous path we got to tread is called the highway to heaven and by the great lord above it is straight and it is
reverend cutlip contd keep your eyes on the prize and your feet on the street and you wont ever make a mis step you wont ever falter you wont ever
stumble because jesus will show you the way
several people in the audience are up and shouting now getting into the spirit
reverend cutlip shifts gear filling his voice with a sense of dread and warning but you got to pay attention to who it is walking beside you brothers and sisters
got to be wary against those who will hold you back from your journey
theres many a loved one got to be left behind
cause you either on the road or you lost in the wilderness
we tighten on delilah as she listens upset taking this all very personally you either headed for glory or doomed to damnation
you either in with the lord or you in with the devil and they aint no in between
we track past cells full of black prisoners tulsa aint so bad but for the smell got them stockyards near the jail thats right and the flies
course i had me in a cell in georgia once six other men didnt have no window atall
must of got caught on one a them freights
sonny is in a big common cell with the other conscripted labor gang
he hangs on the bars as behind him men pitch pennies while ned and another veteran jailbird king compare lodging experiences yeah aint no free ride allowed through georgia
and the food there paltry paltry aint the word for it
breakfast was a joke lunch was a rumor and dinner was a anecdote
laughs spose you been locked in that box
or one just like it
sonny begins to sing softly almost to himself well you wake up in the morning hear the bing bong ring walk up to the table and see the same damn
thing all imonna tell you knife a fork and a pan if you say a thing about it youre in trouble with the man the men join him on the chorus let the midnight special shine its light on me oh let the midnight special shine its ever lovin light on me sonny turns to face them you a singer young man
singer guitar player imonna be on the radio some day
people gonna know my name
chuckles keep thinkin that way young man
judge gatlin dont choose to work you into your grave you just might do it
sonny ponders this looking back out through the bars singing more moodily now as we track away from the cell if you ever go to houston dont you stagger dont
you fight cause the sheriff will arrest you youre in the cooler for the night we hear the slow blues dirge bertha may as we see china doll applying polish to bertha maes fingernails music continues
we track back through the house looking at photographs and posters of her singing in her glory days finally tracking out onto the porch where slick sits glumly on the
steps and the undertaker stands in his black suit looking at his watch as mourners begin to pass into the house music continues
mourners pass the open coffin music continues
ty and maceo help carry the coffin down a dirt road slick walking at the head of the mourners following it
music continues as hands grip ropes as the coffin is lowered into the hole reverend cutlip speaks a eulogy slick tries to keep it together scratch and lonnie watch the
ceremony from a tree branch ty looks at his watch slips away from the funeral party
delilah notices frowns
reverend cutlip takes note as well a shovel digs into piled dirt dirt is tossed down upon us and the screen goes black
ty waits for a train still in his mourning suit
we tighten on his face tense preoccupied with his schemes to save the club hear tell miss bertha mae passed
ty whirls around somehow he didnt see possum sitting on a bench behind him guitar in his lap
she lived it how she sang it
ty tries to ignore him looks down the rails waitin for somebody
ty is silent
aint nobody on that train gonna change your luck tyrone
gonna have to save your own self
annoyed what you know about anything
oh nothin much
ty steps away
possum speaks quietly but i know you from way back
possum starts playing a dark moody slide guitar blues
ty looks toward possum not happy hes there then looks away
the music gets louder faster possum moaning and whooping stomping his foot we tighten on tys face tighter tighter then dissolve to were in a bar room smoke heat packed
bodies possums song grows more intense as we track in on guitar man young with slick hair a moustache and tons of attitude
he sneers flicks his cigarette almost straight at us
we track in on young tyrone also swearing stepping away from his piano guitar man hands his guitar to one of the eager men standing close hoping for a fight
a pretty girl stands to one side looking scared and excited covering her mouth with her hands young tyrone steps in to meet him the crowd around almost pushing them together guitar man pulls out a knife
young tyrone grabs for it and they grapple face to face struggling in a terrible dance a train whistle breaks the spell
possum stops playing and cocks his head to listen the whistle again as the train approaches
ty takes a deep breath hoping
mourners are walking back down the country road where we saw the coffin carried
reverend cutlip sidles up to delilah a mournful end for a wayward sinner
she always seemed at peace with herself
the company she kept the life she led i never knew bertha mae to do hurt to a living soul
the reverend is not too pleased with delilahs forgiving attitude were all hoping to see you get over and accept the lord tonight delilah
im hoping so too
cutlip nods toward the field as they pass the prison labor gang picking cotton under guard you been lingering at the threshold long enough sister
time to step ahead
delilah tries not to show how shaken she is by this challenge
she passes out of frame and we see china doll bringing up the rear of the funeral party lost in thought
she looks over into the cotton field sonny bends his back with the other laborers picking and sweating
china doll pauses frowns as she sees it is sonny working a deputy strolling past him shotgun in hand
sonny sees her lowers his head in shame the train has just pulled into the station
a pair of pullman porters step out but nobody else
ty feels his heart sink
shack thomas comes up behind him carrying an overnight bag tyrone got somebody gettin off here
supposed to be
he halts by ty for a moment watching
nobody else is stepping out whats the partys name
sam guitar sam dont know his birth name impressed hes comin here
he calls to the porters further up the platform yo nat
guitar sam get on this train
hes in the hospital back in little rock
you know music folks whatever he was doin he must have done too much of it
the porters laugh
shack realizing this must be a setback for ty pats his shoulder before he steps onto the train well brother maybe he be in tomorrow
we follow ty away from the train as nat calls all aboard
and the engine gathers power
possum sits listening to the single slide notes he plays as if tuning his guitar somebody didnt show up
grim wish theyd made you dumb instead of blind
we hold on possum cackling darkly as ty walks away
the train whistle blows a torn and crumpled guitar sam poster lays on the bar counter
fingers move on the keyboard
ty sits drinking brooding playing and singing softly at the piano
maceo is at the bar well i had my fun if i dont get well no more well i had my fun if i dont get well no more my
head is spinnin and im goin down slow man dont take care of hisself out drinkin and jazzin the women every night
dont make any difference now
got so bad i heard there was some ole boy goes around pretendin to be guitar sam fill out the gigs he misses
does pretty well for hisself what i hear ty pauses on the keyboard somebody we could find
shrugs hell i dont know
just a story i heard
they both go back to brooding
ty takes a drink
he stares at the keyboard there must have been a first one
back slavery days they had the ones that worked in the big house
might not of had shoes always but their pants didnt have no holes and they didnt pick no cotton
thats how they called em
they must of had all their african kinda instruments drums shakers some kind of banjo thing but the piano didnt bring no piano over on them ships from africa
the piano was just sittin there in the white folks big room all polished up and i figure this one boy he goes past fifteen twenty times a day running
the corner of his eye over it
and hes there when they play the masters doin all their minuets and whatever ty plays something like a minuet him standing there with a tray of white people food
pretendin not to have a thought in his head might be only some dust hangin in the air for all they know but hes watchin the fingers see watchin them keys work
this old boy the first one he can play alla them africa kinda instruments he can play mud if you give him the key and the tempo hes got music
in his head in his heart in every damn piece of him theres music
down to the bones and one day the masters is away huntin foxes or some rich white people thing they get up to and hes alone in the room with
that piano and he comes over and sits down on the bench watch out now and he spreads his fingers out the way he seen the minuet player do and he ty hits a minor chord lets it decay and he thinks lord help me i could do some damage with this
maceo is moved by the scene would have liked to been there
i mean to hear the cat play not none of the rest of it
ty gets up and crosses the room with his drink in his hand distraught
this is the end for ty no strategies left nothing but the bitter taste of total defeat mace imonna lose my club
old man toussaint finds out you stole his liquor you like to lose more than that i got no more cards to play maybe if you was to go down
see lucky hardaway in person angry i aint kissin up to no cokey nose conk headed whap
he kicks sonnys guitar case left sticking out under a table and sends it spinning across the floor till it crashes into the bar and flips open
ty and maceo stare at the contents what the hell that sposed to be
maceo pulls out a home built solid body guitar a painted white rectangle with a complicated pickup jury rigged over the strings and yards of electrical cord hanging off it
some kind of guitar
a guitar has got a hole in it thats where the sound comes from
that boy must be bout three bricks shy of a load upstairs
china doll rushes in upset
they gone and arrest him
the high sheriff arrested him and sold him over to judge gatlin
sonny that was here yesterday morning
sonny that got a screw loose is why they arrested him
maceo make a noise on that maceo plucks a string
not much of a sound its electric i plug a chunk of stove wood into the wall i get more music out of it than that mess gonna make
naw man it dont work unless its hooked up to the juice see
you got the juice you dont need the hollow inside the box the music just runs straight from the strings through this wire and comes out he dumps the sack
sonny brought out and outs falls a mass of tubes and wires also home modified your amplifier
which is what this thing must be
sonny said he fix radios in the army
sonny didnt do nothin but feed bedbugs in anybodys army and some of em crawled in his head
surprised if that boy got the wit to pick cotton
judge gatlin bought himself a droolin idiot
what you want to amplify a damn guitar for anyway
daddy less you gonna sit over on your chair and play them little charley christian kind of riffs a sideman sit over there and be all clean and polite
guitar hasnt been up front since them old piss and moan blues shouters sit their blind asses on the corner hollerin for pennies old time music daddy sonny didnt do
nothin to be arrested for
he was just lookin for work
they hung colored boys for less than that darlin
least on the work gang they feed em keep their strength up
but he doesnt belong there
maceo turns the guitar over in his hands you know guitar sam plays him an electric but i dont think its this no hole kind of deal
i hope he plugs it in the wrong socket some night lectrocutes his sorry no show ass
ty has a thought
he looks over at the guitar in maceos hands thinking out loud now if he did show up here and our power was to go out again while he was
playing i think i fixed it good this time ty
ty smiles so he come out and plugs his ax in he come out lookin good from what i hear
all kind of spangly pants and jacket got his name spelled out on the back clothes right hair all slick and shiny flash some gold teeth at them gals got
his sax man behind him maybe a piano harmonica drums you remember that night the lights went out in the esquire club in mobile
smiles and somebody took off with the gate
stole the whole damn register off the counter they didnt hold it against reggie porter did they
naw it was his place that got robbed
didnt hold it against him didnt expect no money back for the show they all too busy diving on the pot of that tonk game got interrupted and nobody suspected
it might be reggie porter hisself that pulled them lights did they
maceo begins to see where ty is leading aw no ty we cant ty claps his hands together jumps up and heads for the door china doll you mind the
place while were gone

ty pulls away leaving the less fortunate stooped in the field music plays on the radio as nadine masterfully works her sewing machine and maceo stands by uneasily
he holds up the denim jacket sonny left at the club this size right but its got to shine

the free pickers are lined up at the side of the road a white clerk sits behind a wooden table in front of the transport truck and pulls cash from
a metal box consulting a thick ledger in front of him as he pays the pickers off
sheriff pugh observes his patrol car parked nearby

i know ever one of guitar sams songs know the chords know the words thats fine
sonny begins to stroll around the edge of the club looking at photos and showbills on the walls china doll said how you was famous once
ty is pleased at his step daughters bragging but doesnt show it i was known but i was never what you call famous
howd you get your start
ty sighs sits back from his work
down in mobile there was an old cathouse professor name of joe dudlow had had a stroke on one side curled him all up but he kept on pluggin
i used to come out and play his left hand for him

this one night it was goin hot and heavy and joe just passed right there at the piano in the middle of black bottom stomp
they propped him up at the bar stuck a drink in his hand and told me to keep poundin them ivories

ty looks at sonny considers telling him what the plan is no i dont spose you will
ty gets up and goes into the back
sonny crosses to the tangle of wires coming out of the wall behind the counter and snaking off in every direction
he grabs hold of one thinking delilah is in her kitchen humming a gospel song to herself apron on as she begins to make a pie
she pulls a metal flour cannister down from the shelf flips the lid off about half full
she starts to scoop flour out from it and something falls out a small cloth purse
she picks it up to put it aside then frowns at the way it feels
she shakes flour off unzips it
maceo loads bottles of beer into the icebox wincing as the sounds of a screaming argument blast in from the bar how could you do that
imonna put that back and double you dont go gamblin with my babys money
i had to send off the advance pay or the man dont come and play i dont care what you took it for i saved that money up for china
doll delilah bursts through the swinging door into the back room pursued by ty trying to explain and you got no business puttin your fingers on it

theres got to be some line you wont cross some thing you wont do the world starts throwin me breaks woman maybe ill catch religion and walk the straight and
narrow like them bible thumpers you sit up with but till that day i

delilah slams the back door as she storms out
ty turns and crack
kicks an empty crate halfway across the floor before stomping out to the bar
maceo opens a beer with the church key hanging from the icebox handle takes a gulp and sits to ponder this new development we hear the revival meeting choir singing
an upbeat number as opal dressed for saturday night checks herself out in a spotted cracked mirror and works on her make up you got to choose got to choose tween the fire and the light music continues
luther struts around a corner in the black section of town dressed up to party
behind him we see a half dozen other young men and women all decked out moving toward the railroad tracks you got to choose got to choose tween the fire
and the light all you sinners got to choose tween the fire and the light music continues
a trio of black privates share a mirror spiffing up their uniforms to go out on leave no earthly love is gonna make it right
you got to choose
dex dressed to go out pulls a shoebox out from under the cot he sits on
he lifts the lid to reveal an old
pistol got to choose tween the world and the lord you got to choose got to choose tween the world and the lord music continues
we track toward the barracks like housing for itinerant workers as pickers come out cleaned up and ready to celebrate all you sinners got to choose tween the world and
the lord ham walks alone
we see him stuff his roll of single dollar bills into one pocket tuck a folding knife into the other
he passes a telephone pole and we hold on the guitar sam poster tacked up on it train is leavin better jump on board
delilah arrives at the revival tent the choir already you got to kneel got to kneel for the savior and pray you got to kneel got to kneel for the
savior and pray
the blue lights of the sign come on
people fill the yard in front heading into the honeydripper
metalmouth collects cover charge at the door money passing hands all you sinners got to kneel for the savior and pray aint no hidin from the judgement day
maybe fifty people are in the club already mostly locals and harvest hands with more arriving all the time ty stands watching the crowd tense not at all confident that
any of his scheme is going to work a group of twenty of the black soldiers from the base step in maceo comes over and lays a hand on his shoulder natives gettin restless

i got a baseball bat under the counter but you out here all alone just get the liquor movin mace and keep that money where you can run with it
reverend cutlip holds forth under the lantern light the lord dont want nobody to sit back suffering
he wants you to stand up

he wants you to step forward
he wants you rush down into the merciful arms of his eternal salvation
many of the congregation are up on their feet clapping and testifying is there anyone out here tonight gonna answer his call

delilah is standing tears running down her cheeks filled with the emotion of the moment the fire is heatin up brothers and sisters and judgement day is nigh

delilah starts to walk down the aisle thats right come on down

china doll fusses with sonnys hair after he hangs his guitar dangling with electrical hookups over his head you look good

china doll exits and ty looks back to sonny well you look like something might of come outa new orleans
i forget to tell you i fixed your hook up
where the electricity comes in

they turn to see maceo stepping in concerned we got a situation out there you dont think i know that

sheriff pugh stands near the piano putting a considerable damper on the mood in the room
ty hurries out to him with a panic stricken smile on his face didnt think wed be seeing you so soon

our agreement was the situation we got sheriff what with this special guest come up from louisiana what it means is uhm ty has nothing the crowd is starting to

she shoots a look to ty its important not to bite off more than you can chew

she kisses ty on the cheek and heads for the kitchen good luck tonight baby
slap some maynaise on it
ty smiles his nerves all gone now pointing might want to wait over there sheriff
dont want to scare off the customers a cheer from the crowd
sonny has wandered uncertainly out onto the stage
oh lord ty runs up to his microphone shoots a look to the bar maceo is pouring a scotch with one hand the other wrapped around the wires coming out
of the wall
he nods to ty sonny starts to hook his guitar up with a thick coil of wire then into the dented amp sitting on a wooden chair beside him and
pointed out at the crowd
metalmouth sims looks on uncomfortably
ty puts on his biggest grin easing behind the keyboard so heres what you all been waitin for people the noted performer and recordin star
time trenier strolls in with his sax still in its case hat on his head exuding his no sweat attitude
beside him is young henry a kid who cant be more than wearing a fedora direct from new orleans louisiana guitar sam
a terrible squawk emits from the amp as sonny makes the connection sheriff pugh cover his ears the girls from the store cover their ears making pained faces sonny pulls
his guitar away from the amp and the squawk settles to a fuzzy buzz
sonny frowns at the amp sorry folks must of got kicked on the train
the audience is stone faced
could this really be the man
young henry steps up and sits behind the drum kit pulling sticks from inside his shirt ty closes his eyes begins to shake his head in defeat china doll looks
worried collecting another cover charge at the door delilah steps out from the kitchen and looks to the stage worried sonny holds his arms out wide shifting his body to get the buzz under control dex leans to talk in junebugs ear whats this fool playin at
maceo isnt going to wait to find out
he grabs the wires with both hands yanks they hold firm
he looks to the stage panicked as sonny brings his fingers to the strings and the amp blasts the room with a long trip hammering spine shivering ty stands at
the piano with his mouth hanging open sonny whoops and leans into his microphone gonna hold may baby as tight as i can tonight shell know im a mighty man
have you heard the news
theres good rockin tonight
sonny looks over to ty who catches himself and begins to play along
young henry is impassive as he plays a fast shuffle on the skins ty looks over to maceo half climbing the wall as he tries to pull the wires out
maceo sees ty who waves him off have you heard the news
theres good rockin tonight
delilah smiles and presses her hands together shooting a look upward thank you jesus
time trenier has his case open now the gleaming instrument in one hand squinting at the mouthpiece as he holds it up to the light with the other meet me
at midnight behind the barn dont you worry ill do you no harm the crowd is already clapping and stomping in time with the song
henry starts to hit the two and the four beat hard to keep time make sure to bring my rockin shoes tonight im gonna rock away all of my blues
time trenier screws the mouthpiece on puts his horn to his lips and blows right on the beat to take the sax break walking through the parting crowd to the
junebug grabs opals hand and they begin to dance a modified jitterbug people spreading to give them room sheriff pugh hands still over his ears sits in a corner paying
special attention to opals hip action as time continues to blow stepping up onto the stage sonny keeps urging metalmouth sims to come closer to his microphone with the harmonica
sims is hesitant but sonny keeps waving closer closer metalmouth shoots a nervous look to ty who nods from the piano so he butts his harp smack against the microphone
takes a deep breath and honks his soul out grabbing the break from time
the audience goes wild a half dozen couples dancing now others clapping and finger popping and jumping to the beat where they stand
sonny shakes out the long cord attached to his guitar china doll is trying to keep collecting from the new customers pressing in the door and dance at the same
time thrilled by the music
lonnie and scratch sneak in behind her as she turns toward the bandstand metalmouth wraps up his break and sonny takes over with the guitar again making it wail as
he hops off the stage steps up on a chair then onto the bar counter
he walks the length of the bar playing his ass off hops down at the far end grins at china doll and heads out through the door dragging extension cord
lonnie and scratch hurry to pull slack for him as he steps out into the ham and a few other pickers stand outside toussaints beers in hand staring across toward
the honeydripper as sonny steps out playing with a crowd behind him what the hell is that
sonny steps out into the middle of the crossroads and plays a car stopping short of running him over
he hops up on the hood and keeps playing a truck from the other direction stopping to blast him with its headlights
sonny indicates with his guitar neck to the crowd emptying out of toussaints that he wants them to follow then hops down onto a big pickers back and is carried
back in to the honeydripper still playing we got to check that out
a couple dozen patrons move away with him
we hold on the doorway as old man toussaint comes out to look puzzled and angry time and metalmouth sing into the same microphone as sonny plays his way back
up to the stage have you heard the news
theres good rockin tonight have you heard the news
theres good rockin tonight we follow as maceo hustles back and forth trying to keep up with orders for ribs bring cold beers out from the icebox etc
he suddenly stops in his tracks nadine stands before him looking fatally sexy in a satin dress she no doubt made herself
oh my soul
dont tire yourself out poppa
you an me got bidness together
i believe we do
he hurries past with his arms full of beer pivoting to check her out from another angle dex sees across the room frowns ham is talking to lucille at the
bar leaning in close to be heard over the music
i heard the news theres good rockin tonight
sonny finishes with a squawking chord and the joint goes wild alla you men grab hold of a woman
you cant find a woman just grab hold of yourselves we gonna play this one slow and tight
sonny goes into the intro for louis jordans blue light boogie
time lays down a steady rock beat with his sax and ty joins in at the piano they did the boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
they did the boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low ty joins him they did the boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low ty takes the verse i went to a party with a bobby sox i started swingin all she would do was rock as they join in the chorus ty sees cool breeze strolling in checking out the action with a proprietary air
ty looks to maceo getting back behind the bar
maceo sees as well tightening up cool breeze nods to ty
a slow sexy sax break comes up and ty leaves the piano to cross to the bar
when he gets there maceo is already counting out a huge pile of bills
hundred forty two forty three forty four five six seven eight nine hundred fifty
and theys another fifty in here maceo thunks a heavy cloth sack full of change onto the countertop lucky hardaway dont mind some change does he
cool breeze doesnt even glance at the money hard eying ty instead what if mr
hardaway was to say let the chumps keep their change he wants the club back one way or the other
maceo looks to ty who remains impassive mind working howd that be
well hed have to take it up with my bidness partner
ty shifts and we rack focus to see across the room to sheriff pugh receiving his sack of chicken and white bread from delilah
ty smiles and waves cool breeze reconsiders his terms that sheriff your partner
sighs yeah and hes twice as mean as he is ugly
cool breeze grins scoops up the bills on the counter you must want this club awful bad brother
cool breeze hefts the sack of change shoots a look to the stage and leans over to speak into tys ear
you maybe know this already but that aint no guitar sam
he steps away just as the song ends to applause ty taking a deep sigh of relief
sonny steps up to the microphone to introduce the next song you is a lie
a shocked silence
the audience makes way for old man toussaint to come tottering up to the foot of the stage
he points a bony finger at sonny you is a lie boy
i known sammy since hes drinkin mamas milk hell i known his mama herself when she live up to plaquemine and you aint him
the audience looks to sonny for his defense ty holds his breath
maceo brings the baseball bat up from behind the bar
sonny just smiles thats creole guitar sam you talkin bout pops
im delta guitar sam
toussaint ponders this a moment then huffs as long as we straight on that
get on outa there and let the man play
a chorus of cries to the same effect and sonny crosses back to his microphone imonna play you one i come up with today while i was havin my hair
cut he starts into a bouncy intro that metalmouth joins in with then starts to sing as the crowd starts to dance and clap
oh china doll cant get you offa my mind
oh china doll i cant get you offa my mind
if you be my baby gonna leave all them others behind
the front row is all girls goggling at sonny instant groupies but we rack to china doll transfixed as she is drawn toward the stage oh china doll think about
you day and night
oh china doll i think about you day and night
cant forget you baby oh when you gonna treat me right
time trenier steps in for a growling sax break ty looks around the crowded rocking room the sheriff makes his way through the crowd and out the door
the last person he passes turns toward ty possum
but then dancers cross in front and he is gone
ty frowns troubled
under the sax now we hear a dissonant slide guitar the haunting notes possum was playing at the train station
ty searches the crowd the slide guitar continues underneath as we pan across the crowd dancing theres possum again at the bar face turned toward ty
we tighten on ty
why is he here
possum turns his head slowly fixes on something and we pan to see dex and ham standing toe to toe snarling into each others face
we punch in tighter and tighter on the young men body language telling us a fight is about to break out ty desperately pushes his way across the crowded floor
to reach them and the flashbacks come again the sax music growing echoey and menacing the shaky perspective and over saturated colors again tight on the men struggling the girl cowering then young tyrone twisting the guitar mans wrist and thrusting again and again hugging close to him then pulled away and the knife falls to the floor bloody and the guitar man falls to his hands and knees his stomach a bloody mess crawling on all fours and howling and young tyrone watching in horror as he is held back by many arms and the girl screaming which becomes time blowing his sax into the microphone and dex reaches for his pistol and ham reaches for his knife but a huge strong hand clamps down on dexs wrist and another huge hand grabs hams wrist
ty is there clamping onto them with a grip of iron
a lighter bouncier electric guitar riff has replaced the sax now
ty looks deep into the eyes of the two surprised pickers yall in my house here gentlemen
dont have no fightin dont have no killin dont have none of that dismal nonsense in my house
whats your name son
dex is shaken by the strength of the grip on his arm dex dexter moncrief
well gentlemen this is the night there wont be no pitiful song written bout you two killin each other
dont nothin rhyme with moncrief anyhow
maceo is there now holding a cardboard box in one hand and the baseball bat in the other got a problem here
these young men seem to brought something in for our collection
to dex yours first
ty gently takes the pistol from dex regards it grimly before laying it in the box
he turns his attention to ham now yours
he takes the knife from ham tosses it in the box yall still need to mess with each other you go outside and do it
ty lets go of their wrists this world is full of people got no use for us like to see us in the grave
we dont need to give em any help
the two give each other a final dirty look and move away into opposite corners sonny keeps playing oh china doll got to let you into my heart
oh china doll got to let you into my heart
i surrender darlin i loved you from the very start
ty rushes to the piano joins in jamming with the other players slick sits on a tomb drinking wine moonlight spilling over bertha maes fresh dug grave
he listens to the music in the far distance sound like the music movin on again darlin
the way it always do
he listens for another moment sighs time to make room for whoever comin next
the sun rises next to the honeydripper sign
we hear the crow of a distant rooster
the parking lot is empty but for tys old ford ty exhausted but happy steps out front
he pastes a snipe that says held over
across the guitar sam poster that boy can play some
possum is on the road guitar strung over his shoulder feeling his way with a red tipped cane
aint needed round here no more
where you headed
smiles oh down the road
ty watches the blind man move away for a moment
tyrone ty turns as maceo steps out equally tired and unshaven who you talkin to out here
maceo looks down the road but possum is nowhere to be seen
ty shrugs just myself
scratch and lonnie are set to pretend to play music again
lonnie spreads his fingers over the keys hes drawn on the board and begins to play
fast rhythmic boogie piano
instead of a diddley bow scratch is pretending to tune the two strings on a guitar made of a plank of wood and baling wire
he carefully takes a length of clothesline rope leading from the guitar tacks the end of it to the wall of the shack plugging himself in
he looks to lonnie who nods and then he begins to play in time with lonnie
we crane up and away from them the music spilling out over the field it sounds a whole lot like rock and roll
