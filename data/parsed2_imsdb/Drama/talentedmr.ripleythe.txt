the talented mr ripley shooting draft by anthony minghella screenplay by based on the novel by st november fade up on ripley as in the final scene of the film
sitting desolate in a ships cabin
the camera rotates around his face which begins in light and ends in darkness
if i could just go back
if i could rub everything out
starting with myself
starting with borrowing a jacket
ripley is at the piano accompanying fran a young soprano
ah such fleeting paradise such innocent delight to love be loved a lullabye then silence
the song finishes
theyre the entertainment at a cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary
some partygoers congratulate fran on her performance
a distinguished looking man pushing his wife in a wheelchair approaches ripley offers his hand
thank you sir
pointing at ripleys borrowed jacket i see you were at princeton
then youll most likely know our son dick
we couldnt help noticing your jacket
hesitating how is dickie
fran ripley mr and mrs greenleaf and others emerge from an elevator
emily talks to fran herbert to ripley
to fran i hope youll come and see us
thats very kind
both of you
of course dickies idea of music is jazz
he has a saxophone
to my ear jazz is just noise just an insolent noise
ripley shakes hands with herbert greenleaf as he gets into his rolls royce
they are making an appointment
ripley crosses the street to fran pecks her cheek
she hands him his share of their fee
im so late
he hands frans boyfriend the jacket hes been wearing thanks for the jacket
thanks for filling in for me
from greenleafs point of view he sees a couple embracing
darling couple arent they
an exceptional young man
from another vantage point ripley hurries on as fran gets into her boyfriends car
a piano quartet starts up
ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert goers and heads for the theater
the interval a thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming themselves at the basins
ripley turns on faucets offers towels brushes off dandruff
men talk over round and through him
put coins in a bowl
the concert continues
ripley peers through the curtain at the performances
a haughty woman in the box turns round and he closes the curtain
an empty auditorium
ripley plays bach in the blue ghostlight
a caretaker emerges from his rounds flips on the house lights
ripley jerks up from his playing waves apologetically
greenleaf and ripley walk through one of the drydocks
a huge void in the shape of a boat swarming with workers preparing the shell of a new liner
if central park is where the money is spent this is clearly where its made
and a lot of it
workers nod deferentially to the man with his name over the buildings behind them
south of naples
marge his uh the young lade is supposedly writing some kind of book
god knows what he does
by all accounts they spend the whole time on the beach
or his sailboat
thats my sons talent spending his allowance
ripley in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a sober young man listens attentively
herbert greenleaf contd could you ever conceive of going to italy tom persuade my son to come home
ripley looks doubtful id pay you
id pay you dollars
ive always wanted to go to europe sir but
now you can go for a reason
a vinyl record revolves in close up an exuberant and mysterious voice is scat singing
then the sound slides into a raucous big band jazz number dizzy gillespies the champ ejects the record
when the camera finds the mans face it is hes hot
hes wearing an undershirt
hes trying to identify the recording
i dont know
i dont know
the man pulls of the blindfold examines the record cover of the disc hes been trying to learn needs to put on glasses to do so is irritated by his
he ejects the record
a pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered table which includes classical sheet music and a paper keyboard
one hand idly mimes at the keys
another song for ripley to identify is on the gramophone
chet bakers my funny valentine signs everywhere of packing
books about italy
ripley paces in this room which is bathroom kitchen living room and bedroom all in one
tiny tidy squalid and sad
the windows give onto bars and a wall
dont even know if this is a man or a woman
theres a violent row going on in the room above his head
ripley shining his shoes packing almost done is testing himself on another piece of music
free jazz saxophone charlie parkers koko he listens hard recognizes the track
thats charlie parker
he skips over to the gramophone checks the record
hes right he smiles
ripley studies an old photograph of dickie greenleaf in a princeton yearbook
he shoves the book in a bag picks up his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment before closing the door behind him
ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight
he is met at the top of the stairs by mr greenleafs chauffeur
ill take that
nodding towards the apartment that thousand bucks should come in handy
interupts ripley who is about to open the car door ill get that
as he holds open the door for ripley sir
ripley laughs excitedly youre gonna have a great trip
mr greenleaf is personal friends with the cunard people
ripley luxuriates in the back of the greenleaf limousine
he opens up an envelope hes carrying with greenleaf stationery
inside a first class cunard ticket some travelers checks and dollars
i can tell you
the greenleaf name opens a lot of doors
the liner leaves new york en route to italy
the queen mary has just docked
passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows
coming from the first class gangways they are greeted escorted fussed over into the hall
their bags have been unloaded ahead of them and are now being sorted in the hall under the initials of their owners
stands with the letters of the alphabet chalked on them are dotted about and trunks and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around them
ripley enters and an italian porter approaches wants his name
he repeats in the hubbub and joins the crowd around the letter a striking young woman meredith is nearby
she notices him
ripley proceeds to the customs area where hes held in a line as a large suitcase is opened and searched
meredith catches up with him
her luggage a mountain next to his
whats your secret
no its just you are american arent you
no i just i have so much luggage and youre so uh streamlined
now theyre opening a second case of the passenger ahead
hard not to converse
meredith contd im meredith by the way
dickie dickie greenleaf
they are passed through immigration head down the long stairs towards the street
meredith catches up with ripley
meredith contd youre not the shipping greenleafs
thinking quickly trying not to be
trying to jump ship
so now did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile
its just upstairs werent you under the stand
i thought i saw you there
my father wants me in new york
he builds boats
id rather sail them
i travel under my mothers name
merediths bewildered just kidding
the funny thing is im not randall either
nods recognizing the name as in the
as in the textile logues
trying to shrug off the dress
i travel under my mothers name too
theyve arrived at a crossroads on the stairs graphic signs explain the choices one way for buses taxis and exits the other for trains roma venezia milano theyre going in
meredith contd offering her hand so partners in disguise
looks at the signs bye
a bus rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a cliff mountain above blue sea below
ripley sits surrounded by teeming life
the bus slows at a new town
people get off
later the day ending
ripley looks out as they continue on their journey
arriving at a small fishing port they wind down through a square passing the local church
and then the bus is in the heart of a wharf
on one side theres evidence of the fishermans life nets old men working
opposite theres a tiny cafe spilling out onto the street young guys hang out play table football lounge on their vespas
the driver chants ripley gets out lugging his cases as the bus continues on its way
he looks around him
he feels completely foreign
a sailboat has slid into his view now drops anchor drops the sail
a couple dive off and swim towards shore
all of this is from the point of view of ripley whos watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony in the miramare hotel
an italian vocabulary book is perched on his knees and during this he continues his study mouthing the italian words
looking at a long lean girl about to dive la fidanzata a una faccia
the fiancee has a face
la fidanzata e marge
her partner dickie greenleaf dives too
theyre brown beautiful perfect
ripley notices the name of the boat ripley contd questo e la mia faccia
the golden couple emerge from the sea
dickie shakes off the water grins
ripley contd this is my face
he double checks himself with the vocabulary book
ripley contd questa
e la mia faccia
questa e la faccia di dickie
ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins and stands on the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway
hes wearing a tiny lime green bathing suit
he loathes beaches
a couple of boys turn laconically and watch him
ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea
he feels ridiculous his skin alabaster against the brown bodies
finally the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes and dashes to the water where he luxuriates in the coolness of it before wading out of the
sea and walking straight up to dickie
dickie squints at ripley who holds his shoes lamely
we were at princeton together
he sits up and did we know each other
well i knew you so i suppose you must have known me
to marge princeton is like a fog americas like a fog
to ripley this is marge sherwood
tom sorry what was it
how do you do
how do you do
what are you doing in mongi
finds this idea absurd passing through
youre so white
did you ever see a guy so white marge
its just an undercoat
marge laughs say again
you know a primer
he shares some intimacy with marge makes her laugh
ripley stands as they wrestle around him
marge looks up
you should come and have lunch with us before you go dickie
and be careful in the sun
your grays in danger of turning a little pink
well a coincidence
church bells ringing
dickie dressed in shorts comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square on his motorscooter
he stops by a steep flight of steps
ripley a book in hand unseen walking up a hill catches all this and intrigued watches as a young italian beauty silvana has a spikey flirtatious exchange with dickie then
climbs on the scooter behind him
ive been looking for you everywhere
ah today youre looking for me
and where have you been the rest of the week
with your american girl
i hate you you know
i hate you
and ripley watches them as they rattle down the hill towards the sea
dickie appears in marges garden the sea behind his head
marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of the remnants of lunch
dickies sheepish showered late
sorry sorry sorry
i know im late im a swine
did you forget where i live
its four oclock
i just woke up
you just woke up
fausto and i we took the boat out we were fishing and then it was dawn and wed caught absolutely nothing
well we ate everything without you
yes tom ripleys here
as ripley appears with the tray to collect more dishes
oh tom hello how are you
we thought youd disappeared
we were going to send out a search party
no still here
tom was telling me about his trip over
made me laugh so much i got a nosebleed
is that good
marge flicks him with a napkin
they start to wrestle excluding tom
can you mix a martini
going inside ill do it
i make a fabulous martini
everybody should have one talent
to ripley whats yours
without a beat forging signatures
impersonating practically anybody
enjoying this banter thats three
nobody should have more than one talent
okay do an impression

talent his voice ages his face changes the only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance
absolutely thrown what
i like to sail believe me i love to sail
instead i make boats and other people sail them
incredibly impressed stop

returning with the drinks what

whats going on
i dont get it
could you ever conceive of going there tom and bringing him back
id pay you
if you would go to italy and persuade my son to come home
id pay you
a christening is over and now the whole village is pouring out of church for the passeggiata in sunday best
girls arm in arm parade
boys arm in arm evaluate
new babies are compared and fussed over
old people smoke talk shrug
dickie is walking with ripley seething about his fathers scheming
im never going back
to actually hire somebody to come all the way here to drag me back home got to be insane hasnt he
silvana comes out of church arm in arm with a man her fiancee as part of a foursome which includes dickies pal fausto
silvanas eyes flick towards dickie otherwise theres no acknowledgement as they all greet each other
dickie introduces tom then they move on
dickie contd im never going back
no i think your mother her illness its got nothing to do with my mother
shes had leukemia for
this is what makes me boil about him
he wants me back
its got nothing to do with my mother
i dont know dickie im just telling you what i interrupting go back
go back to new york or call him if you can find a telephone that works and tell him wild horses wouldnt drag me back to him or his shipyard
ripley appears with his meagre luggage at dickies front door
hes carrying his tote bag under his arm the bottom of which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his fingers
marge is on the terrace she looks down to see tom talking with dickie
looks up marge ripleys saying goodbye
ill come down
to ripley did you speak to my father
you were right about the telephones
there are no lines theres some problem
coming out of the front door hello tom
what are your plans
back i suppose slowly as i can
he goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the seam splits and records spill to the ground scattering
he bends down starts gathering them up
ripley contd oh damn sorry this bags dickies delighted when he sees the jazz titles
you like jazz
gathering up the records love jazz
holding up a chet baker this is the best
marge says she likes jazz but she things glenn miller is jazz
i never said that
ask me the name of my sailboat i dont know
whats the name of your sailboat
which is ridiculous
boats are female everyone knows you cant call a boat after a man
hes not a man hes a god
excited okay were going to naples
theres a club its not a club its a cellar
yes its vile
dont worry you dont have to come
to ripley its great
youre going to love it
a cavern blue with smoke
a surprisingly good quintet blast out their version of dickie and ripley arrive and make their way to a table where fausto is sitting with friends
its too noisy for conversation but dickie shouts introductions and they shake ripleys hand
dickie is instantly absorbed in the music ripley absorbed in dickie
an attractive italian girl dahlia comes over kisses dickie pulls off his hat puts it on theres no room for her to sit so she sits on dickies lap smoking
dickie raises his eyebrow at tom but its clearly no hardship
then the band strikes up the intro to tu vuo fa lamericano a hit which reflects the current craze for all things american and fausto pulls a protesting dickie up
onto the stage
improvising in italian ladies and gentlemen
dickie greenleaf all the way from america
fausto starts to sing
dickie joins in the chorus
dickie talks off mic to fausto
fausto contd and a big round of applause for a new friend from new york tom ripley
ripleys mortified but dickie jumps off the stage and pulls him up
the song continues and now at the chorus its dickie and ripley who have to sing
ripley of course can sing well if not confident in this arena
soon the audience is clapping standing on tables dancing dahlia prominent
reading i have bumped into an old friend from princeton a fellow named tom ripley
he says hes going to haunt me until i agree to come back to new york with him
dickie in his new dressing gown is sitting at the table typing
ripleys head emerges from behind the couch on which he has been enjoying a blissful sleep
grins good afternoon
what time is it
puts on his glasses and checks his watch oh god
do you always type your letters
points at the letter that should be two s
i cant write and i cant spell
thats the privilege of a first class education
youre upstairs at the back
i think ermelinda made the bed up
this is so good of you
dont say it again
now youre a double agent and were going to string my dad alone i was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money hes sending you
what do you think marge
a little cinquecento with my dads money
marge has appeared carrying camparis
dickie you cant even drive a car
no what we need urgently is an icebox
what do you think tom
agree with me and ill be your friend for life
i absolutely agree with marge
ripley locates his room puts down his luggage in what is a comfortable and simple room then heads back downstairs only to be tempted by the open door of dickies
ripley explores the casual elegance of dickies bedroom the louis vuitton chest the closets open door spilling out shirts ties
on the dressing table there are toiletries cufflinks scattered a silk tie
ripley picks up the tie and walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where lunch is being laid
marge and dickie are chatting
shreds of conversation float up to ripley
itll just be for a little while
he can be
he makes me laugh
youd say if you mind
no i like him
marge you like everybody
i dont like you
then ill go to your place and you can move in with tom
above them ripley repeats these phrases carefully testing the cadences no i like him
marge you like everybody until hes as accurate as a taperecorder
ermelinda is clearing away lunch
ripley is changed and sitting at the table with marge while dickie works on the coffee
ripley watches him studying everything the way he uses the expresso machine the way he wears no socks his pants his rings
now you know why miss sherwood always shows up for breakfast
its not love its the coffee machine
its the one task dickie can do on his own make coffee
oh darling is that for me
no its for tom as he didnt complain
as dickie hands him his cup that rings so great
the green one
delighted tom i love you
to dickie see
to ripley i bought it for him for his birthday
i had to promise capital p never to take it off otherwise id give it to you
flicking a crumb at him bastard
to ripley isnt it great tom

i bargained for about two weeks
i hope it wasnt cheap
oh it was
to marge i have to find a birthday present for frances
perhaps you can help me
youre a dark horse ripley
your parents met her
oh god i can just imagine if only dickie would settle down
doesnt every parent deserve a grandchild
i swear on your ring marge
i am never going back
the bird is sailing off the coast of mongibello
theres a manoeuvre going on with the sail
captain dickie supervises his crew of marge and a painfully awkward anxious to please ripley
dickie goes over to help him
im doing this wrong arent i
youre doing great
well make a sailor of you yet
youre doing really well
dubious but special honor tom crewing dickies boat
alright bars open
she heads for the cabin
dickie settles down beside ripley
could we sail to venice
i love venice
i have to go to venice
see venice and die isnt that right
or is it rome
you do something and die dont you
okay venice is on the list
do you ski
ripley frowns dont tell me youre a lost cause
thats the next thing to deal with
were planning to go to cortina at christmas
as marge reappears marge ripley cant ski
well have to teach him that too
have you ever known such low class
good thing were not getting married
we might have to invite him on our honeymoon
marge and ripley are on a shopping expedition
they walk down the hill towards the grocery shop next to the bar in the little square
ripley has asked marge how she and dickie met
oh i hated new york that park avenue crowd so i fled to paris to work on my book and i was always going to this cafe with jean jacques
and dickie used to play his saxophone outside and i would see him and he would see me and he would play my funny valentine
it was only later that i realised he only knows about six songs
theyve arrived at the grocery store
alessandra the woman who owns the store greets them
silvana whos her daughter is also there and less comfortable
she waits for marges order
marge contd to silvana in italian buono sera silvana
por favore arance e pane e del prosciutto
silvana goes inside for the meat and bread
marge contd back to ripley anyway then one day we go in i see dickie he starts playing my funny valentine and then all of a sudden he just walks
into the cafe right in front of jean jacques and grabs me
now i had never spoken to him in my life he said im going to italy tomorrow and i want you to come with me
so i did
at the edge of the square theres a bocce area where men throw metal balls along a track aiming to get closest to a small cue
dickie is there playing intensely with fausto and two other guys one of whom weve seen before with silvana
ripley and marge loop back towards home taking in the bocce en route
they wave back
marge calls to him
marge contd if youre not at my place by
tom and i are running off together
dickie and ripley are leaving
theyre fooling around
dickie jumps on ripleys shoulders
marge watches from the top of the garden
dickie and ripley still horsing about pass silvanas grocery store
dickie dismounts goes over to silvana whos tense a little troubled
they huddle ripley isolated
did you get my message
i want to talk to you
i want to talk to you too
smile for me
and dickies already gone back to ripley feinting to box him then dancing satyr like down the hill
dickie and ripley on the vespa
theres a steep incline where the road winds down towards naples and as the vespa gains speed ripley is happy to cling to dickie
youre breaking my ribs
youre breaking my ribs
ripleys really singing carrying the burden of my funny valentine in a flawless imitation of chet baker
dickie is playing some sax
after a verse theres spontaneous applause
dickie impressed beams at ripley
a new icebox incongruous in pride of place in the living room casts its glow on a delighted dickie as he pulls out a couple of beers handing one to
ripley who is paging through his copy of the collected works of shakespeare
i could fuck this icebox i love it so much
considering ripley what were you actually doing in new york
i played piano in a few places
thats one job you told me a lot of jobs
a few places thats a few jobs
anyway i dont want to think about new york
the mysterious mr ripley
marge and i spend hours speculating
drinking cold beer
thank you dad
copy out from here
he hands the book to dickie pointing out the lines
staring to write on the back of a postcard i love the fact you brought shakespeare with you and no clothes
ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night
is that true
ive got more than one shirt
she can do that stuff for you
anyway just wear some of my things wear anything you want most of its ancient
hes finished writing now your signature
watching him write not dickie
dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard
ripley studies the writing takes off his glasses to clean them
dickie looks at him
without the glasses youre not even ugly
takes them tries them on i dont need them because i never read
how do i look
like clark kent
takes them back puts them on beaming at dickie now superman
dickie cuffs him
ripley looks down at the postcard
i write like a child
see this the and the do you see
fine vulnerable thats pain thats secret pain
it must be a deep secret cause i dont know about it
your handwriting nothing more naked
see nothings quite touching the line thats vanity
flattered well we certainly know thats true
dickies in the bath
ripley dressed sits on the stool next to the bath
theyre in the middle of playing chess the board propped on the bath tray
ripley puts his hand in the water checking the temperature
he turns on the faucet for a burst of hot
ripley is absurdly happy
he pours some wine
do you have any brothers
no no brothers no sisters
nor does marge
all only children what does that mean
he looks at ripley who looks at him a little too long
means we never shared a bath
can i get in
i didnt mean with you in it
standing okay you get in
im like a prune anyway
he gets out walks past ripley who doesnt turn around
but dickies reflected in the mirror
ripley looks then dickie turns holds his look momentarily before flicking him with his towel
an official is studying dickies passport photograph
its not a recent picture
the official looks suspicious
dickie is used to it
it is me
its an old picture
sighs at ripley every time is it you
doesnt look like you
hes signing for his allowance
he has a smart document case with his initials prominently embossed
ripley watches him sign and collect a large wad of notes
letters greenleaf and for ripley
ripley collects and studies his mail
as they walk outside he holds up one letter to dickie
anticipating her letter i miss you where are you coming home
stop telling me what a great time youre having how you love dickie
and marge and
the next letter and this one i think is your dad
ripley sits reading the letter from herbert greenleaf
he frowns stops reading looks out of the window
what does he say
hes getting impatient
he wants me to reassure him youll be home by thanksgiving
youve got to get a new jacket
you must be sick of the same clothes
im sick of seeing you in them
i cant keep spending your fathers money
i love how responsible you are
my dad should make you chief accountant or something
let me buy you a jacket
theres a great place when we get to rome batistoni
ripley loves this idea and mouths the word batistoni
dickie contd andiamo a roma
were taking tom to roma
ripley and dickie sit outside at a cafe in the piazza navona
very smart very sophisticated very young crowd
there are already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of frascati
ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly impatient
dickie meanwhile has stretched out for the duration
where do we find a carozza for the forum or can we hire any of them
its just theres so much to do in a single day
the most important question is where to eat
i hope freddie made a reservation
you know hes organizing the cortina skiing trip
ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded
a horn makes him look up as freddie miles illegally parks his open top sports car opposite the cafe sees dickie and bustles over
hes a heavy set american with a reddish crewcut
ripley finds him disgusting to look at
dickie is delighted
dickie contd frederico
noticing a beautiful woman in an open topped car dont you want to fuck every woman you see
they kiss cheeks continental style
this is tom ripley
mugging hey if im late think what her husbands saying
he fills dickies glass with wine and drinks it standing up
freddie contd so lets go
i got us a table outside at fabrizios
and dickies up leaving ripley to pick up all the tiny checks to work out the bill and pay it
ill tell you i am so cabin crazy with mongi
freddie and dickie link arms italian style and cross the street to freddies car
i was there
looks back to see ripley struggling to settle the check tommy
standing room only
chop chop tommy
ripley abandoned goes over
theres no room in the car
he has to crouch in the rear
freddie contd youre going to have to sit between us
but dont put your shoes on the seat know what i mean put them one on top of the other
this record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley and stuffed with the trendiest romans all of whom rifle the stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke
there are two listening booths one of which has freddie and dickie crammed into it sharing a set of headphones
ripley stands outside the booth holding both of their jackets like a manservant while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly
he looks longingly at the street where the light is fading
dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the accordion doors
look tom weve got to go to a club and meet some friends of freddies
the best thing is if you want to be a tourist grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station
absolutely crestfallen what club
freddies arranged it with some of the skiing crowd
come if you want but i thought you wanted to see the forum
and then maybe get the jacket and what have you
from inside the booth dick youve got to hear this
oblivious to ripleys pain listen just take one of mine when we get back
dont worry about it
i did the forum with marge and frankly once is enough in anyones life
ripley hands him the coats turns away
ripley heads for the door then comes back raps on the booth
dickie pushes it open
you said to make sure you didnt miss the train
it leaves at eight
ripley hikes up michelangelos arcoeli steps
then hes looking down from the campodoglio at the forum below
then hes walking by the oversized fragments of the colossus
this is the real ripley the lover of beauty inspired by art by antiquity
he so much wishes he werent alone
its past eight ripley stands one foot on the guard step of the naples train waiting forlornly for dickie then giving up as the train pulls away
he pulls the door to his compartment closed and sits inside the train alone
theres music playing bing crosbys may i
ripley dances to the mirror spectacles abandoned and dressed as dickie in his tuxedo minus trousers
he adjusts his hair catches one of dickies expressions
there are clothes abandoned everywhere
hes been having a big dressing up session
he sings along with bing
what are you doing
ripley turns horrified to see dickie standing in the doorway
the music thumps away
oh just amusing myself
pause i didnt think you were coming back
dickie turns off the record player
i wish youd get out of my clothes
ripley starts undressing his fingers clumsy with mortification and shock
dickie looks at his feet shakes his head
dickie contd shoes too
lame ashamed you said i could pick out a jacket and i just
get undressed in your own room would you
i thought youd missed the train
freddie drove me back in his car
horrified is freddie here
i was just fooling around
dont say anything
dickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the dressing up session not amused
ripley comes down apprehensive to find marge and dickie and freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace
dickie looks perfectly happy
come join us
i want this job of yours tommy
i was just saying you live in italy sleep in dickies house eat dickies food wear his clothes and his father picks up the tab
if you get bored let me know ill do it
the boat is drifting
freddie and dickie and marge are swimming then marge climbs back onto the boat where ripley is sitting alone reading
you really should go in its marvellous
she approaches him conscious of his isolation
shes in a red bikini and she towels herself dry as they speak
are you okay
they watch dickie and freddie fooling around in the water
the thing with dickie its like the sun shines on you and its glorious then he forgets you and its very very cold
so im learning
hes not even aware of it
when youve got his attention you feel like youre the only person in the world
thats why everybody loves him
theres a yell from dickie as freddie wrestles with him
laughing and choking hes drowning me
its always the same whenever someone new comes into his life freddie fausto peter smith kingsley hes wonderful did you meet him hes a musician
and especially you of course
and thats only the boys
they watch as freddie pushes dickie under the surface
marge contd tell me why is it when men play they always play at killing each other
im sorry about cortina by the way
what about cortina
didnt dick say
he talked to freddie
apparently its not going to work out ripleys devastated marge notices cant look at him freddie says there arent enough rooms
later and now the boat is sailing again
ripley is sitting in his spot
dickie and freddie are at the tiller
come on frederico do you really have to go back
at least stick around for the festival of the madonna
i dont think so
come back with me to rome
theres this great new club
have some drinks lotta ladies
marge still in her bikini disappears into the cabin
dickie makes a face at freddie
do you think you can steer this thing
just point her at capri and avoid the rocks
what are you doing
dickie heads towards the cabin
freddie takes over the tiller
theres a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the water
from where ripley sits he can see capri in the distance but he can also look down into the cabin its porthole offering him a restricted view
he looks down and theres a flash of flesh then nothing
then as the boat swings with the waves he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair and then marges bare foot kicking out rhythmically the red painted toes straining
ripleys mesmerized aroused and absolutely betrayed
freddie contd tommy hows the peeping
come on tommy you were looking
tommy tommy tommy
shamed ripley looks away
he stares at the water parting before the boat its turmoil reflecting his
the bird returns to the mooring by dickies house
dickie as ever captain of the ship clambering around shouting instructions with ripley marge and freddie as crew
ripley looks back at shore
silvana stands watching staring
dickie notices her too
a womans head suddenly breaks the surface of the water
its a statue of the virgin mary life size adorned with flowers and a lace veil
as she is revealed wooden staring four men emerge lifting the statue on a palette wading towards the shore the madonna aloft on their shoulders
the whole town of mongibello is in attendance for this annual festival of the madonna del mare either standing in their fishing boats or on shore and flanking the parish
priest and altar boys and incense
ripley dickie and marge watch from dickies terrace
there are hymns and as the statue is carried to the shore the mens heads barely above the waves the congregation applauds at the illusion that the madonna is walking
suddenly another head appears on the surface of the water about fifty yards from the statue
theres a scream from among the crowd as someone notices the body
one of the men carrying the statue turns first towards the direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse
its silvanas fiancee and in a second he has let go of the palette causing it to topple and in absolute grief wades swims splashes towards the body
pandemonium in the crowd which breaks up with other people splashing fully clothed into the water
from the terrace ripley turns and looks at dickie catching his eye
marge and ripley and dickie watch from the terrace as below them an ambulance takes away the body
it seems as if the whole town looks on fiancee parents brothers sisters police priest etc
as the corpse is loaded into the vehicle a brief scuffle occurs between silvanas fiancee and her brother
they are pulled apart
then the ambulance pulls away
whats the fight about
thats her fiance isnt it
are they blaming him
sharp i dont know
why are you asking me
agitated how can it take an hour to find an ambulance
conciliatory well she was already dead darling wasnt she so i suppose i dont know why people say this countrys civilised
its fucking primitive
and with that he kicks out violently at a chair supporting the recordplayer
records machine chair go flying across the terrace
dickie storms inside
ill go and see whats the matter
later dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window overlooking the slipway
hes playing sax
a forlorn keening phrase from you dont know what love is
ripley appears begins tidying the mess in the living room
he picks up empty bottles an abandoned bikini top
i know why youre upset
dickie continues playing i know about silvana dickie
about you and silvana
dickie stops playing
what about us
he now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles
dickie contd losing his temper you dont have to clean up
ripley disappears into the kitchen
dickie contd as ripley returns she was pregnant
did you know that
do you know what that means in a place like this
im prepared to take the blame
what are you talking about
youve been so good to me
youre the brother i never had
im the brother you never had
she came to me for help she needed money and i didnt help her
i didnt help her
now shes dead and its my fault
im not going to say anything to marge or anybody the police its a secret between us and ill keep it
and he disappears again leaving dickie to resume the sax somehow in thrall to ripley
dear tom i think the time has come to discontinue your expense checks
ripley and dickie are walking out of the american express office dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case ripley despondent reading aloud extracts from a letter from
herbert greenleaf the thousand dollars of course was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing dickie home
naturally i hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way
you cant blame him
you could hardly expect this to go on forever
i thought you might write again
now that were brothers
i cant how can i in all decency
weve had a good run havent we
increasingly miserable what about venice
can we stick to that plan at least
i dont think so tom
you cant stay on here without money
its time we all moved on
besides im sick of mongi
especially now with everything i really want to move to the north
i need to check out san remo next week find somewhere new to keep the boat
but it would be great though if you came with me
our last trip before you leave
theres a jazz festival we could say goodbye in style
what do you think
a last trip
dickie and ripley travel up to san remo
they sit next to each other
ripley lays his head on dickies shoulder but as he does that the ticket inspector announces the san remo stop taps on the window and dickie stirs
then ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the reflection of the train window so that he can move his head and see his reflection then back
and see dickies
dickie suddenly catches him staring
ripley looks away
terse why do you do that thing with your neck
on trains you always do that thing its so spooky
dickie and ripley walk through the terrace of an hotel which lips out towards the sea
theres a restaurant and palms and a jazz quintet playing american
they pass the band
dickies captivated as they head for their table
they pass some girls at a table
dickie smiles greedily
this is more like it
didnt i tell you san remo was crazy
theyre shown to a good table
dickie watches the band while their glasses are filled with champagne
ripley looks happy
hes got dickie all to himself
to mongibello and the happiest days of my life
youre cheerful tonight
im suddenly quite happy to be going back
ive got plans
im always planning
did i know you at princeton tom
i didnt did i
why are you asking all of a sudden
because youre leaving i guess
i dont think you were there were you
i mean it as a compliment
youve got such great taste i dont know
most of the thugs at princeton had tasted everything and had no taste
used to say the cream of america rich and thick
freddies the perfect example
then ill take it as a compliment
i knew it
i had a bet with marge
a beat ha
do you even like jazz or was that something for my benefit
conceding without guile ive gotten to like it
ive gotten to like everything about the way you live
its one big love affair
if you knew my life back home in new york
dickies distracted by the drummer whos playing an extrovert solo doesnt hear the confession of love
im thinking of giving up the sax what do you think about drums
he mimes a high hat and snare
ripley cant quite credit this its superficiality
the bay of san remo
dickie and ripley have hired a motor boat
thats how i found my place in mongi
took a boat out round the bay
the first place i liked i got it
the motor boat is ploughing the waves
dickie exhilarated by the speed
dickie slow down come on
ripley grips the oar his knuckles white
dickie cuts the motor and the boat slows to a crawl miles from the shore
ecstatic i love it here
gonna live here
dickie takes off his jacket then drums against the edge of the boat developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers already on the way to becoming buddy rich
i wanted to tell you my plan
so tell me
i thought i might come back
in the new year
under my own steam
suddenly tight really
lets say for arguments sake you were here perhaps we could split the rent on a house ill get a job or better still i could get a place in
rome and when were there we could be there and if were here we could be here oh god i dont think so
you see particularly with the marge problem you can just blame me
marge and i are getting married
yesterday youre ogling girls on the terrace today youre getting married
i love marge
you love me and youre not marrying me
cold tom i dont love you
no no its not a threat ive explained all of that
im actually a little relieved youre going to be honest
i think weve seen enough of each other for a while
ripley stares at him his eyes suddenly reptilian
you can be a leech you know this and its boring
you can be quite boring
volcanic the funny thing im not pretending to be somebody else and you are
im absolutely honest with you
ive told you my feelings
but you first of all i know theres something that evening when we played chess for instance it was obvious incredulous what evening
sure i know thats too dangerous for you fair enough hey
were brothers fine then you do this sordid thing with marge fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen which was excruciating frankly plus you follow your
cock around like a and now youre getting married
im bewildered forgive me
youre lying to marge then getting married to her youre knocking up silvana youve got to play sax youve got to play drums which is it dickie what do you
dickie furious gets up and lurches towards ripley
attacking him administering tiny slaps as punctuation to his tirade who are you some imposter some third class mooch who are you to tell me anything
actually i really really really dont want to be on this boat with you i cant move without you moving which is exactly how it feels and it gives me
he goes to rev up the engine i cant move without dickie dickie dickie like a little girl
you give me the shut up
just shut up
just shut up
the boat slows as dickie releases the tiller
dickie looks up at ripley wearily and slides onto his back
for gods sake
ripley shocked at himself goes to dickie rocking the boat catches him up then is horrified to see dickies face apparently unmarked suddenly split open a line of blood and
then a peeling like a fruit bursting
a terrible roar issues from dickie as he launches himself at ripley
dickie contd ill kill you
ripley finds himself pushing him away picking up the oar kicking off dickies hand around his ankle
the boat is rocking and swerving crazily as dickie falls against the tiller
ripley almost loses his balance
his glasses come off
they struggle locked together in a life or death wrestle to get control of the oar
dickies blinded by his own blood loses his grip
ripley terrified hits dickie again and again the oar like a carpet beater banging down flat blood on the blade blood on ripley until hes on his knees heaving for
breath letting his arm drop then realizing disgusted that hes let it rest in a pool of blood
he starts to sob sprawls there sobbing next to dickie horrified by what hes done
nobodys in sight
the boat rocks gently the sun sparkling indifferently on the waves
ripley lies by dickie in the bottom of the boat in the embrace hes always wanted
the pretty blue and white boat rocks peacefully
the sea calms
a deserted cove several miles along the coast
ripley clambers onto a rock over the shore
hes watching the boat slowly sinking
shuddering from the exertion the cold he finds dickies jacket puts it on and watches as the boat disappears under the surface
ripley walks back towards the hotel still wearing dickies jacket cold and wet his bag over his shoulder
ripley approaches the front desk
hes not wearing his glasses
can i have my key please
at the key rack of course but you must be very cold
mind racing no its im
ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards mongi
he stares out of the window full of what hes done
no idea what to do
the bus comes into town
ripley gets out looks calm very together
ripley walks into the living room slowly approaches dickies saxophone which is on its stand on the table
he cant get close to it it evokes dickie too much
ripley has dickies hermes baby typewriter on the desk and is busy writing letters
he has finished a letter to the greenleafs now hes at the end of one to marge
we can read part of it c o american express rome november
dear marge this is a difficult letter for me to write ripley produces the shakespeare and signature page and copies dickies signature at the end of the letter
ripley stands at the entrance to marges garden where she is working at her book on the outside table surrounded by references and notes held down by bricks
he looks at her until she looks at him
shes startled gasps
tom you startled me
how are you
is your book going well
yes im on a good streak thanks
i was just looking at you looking at her tenderly so quiet
i think hes planning on staying in rome for a few days
looks at him ha
did he say why
i dont know
i dont understand dickie marge so your guess is as good as mine
what does that mean
well one day im invited skiing the next day im not one day were all one family the next day he wants to be alone
you tell me
is that what he said he wanted to be alone
he was thinking of you marge he asked me to deliver this
he hands her a package
she pulls at it its perfume
he knows i love this although why it couldnt have waited
errand number one deliver marges perfume
errand number two pack some clothes and his precious saxophone
alarmed how longs he staying for
i guess were abandoned
marge is walking along the beach and out onto the jetty forlorn a bleached figure on this winter morning
as ripley walks down the stairs marge is at the icebox in the living room
shes fixing herself a drink has the icebox open for ice
shes ashen and might have been weeping walks back into the kitchen area
there was a letter from dickie in with my perfume
you realize its more than a few days
hes thinking of moving to rome
she bangs out the ice onto the counter cubes falling everywhere
ripley drops to the floor and starts to clear them up
shes got the letter shows it to ripley
he puts fresh ice into her glass
marge contd the thing is the night before he left we talked about moving together going north and i suppose i put some pressure on him about getting married i
just might have scared him off
theres a side to him when our heads are on the pillow i know no one else sees it which is really tender
unravelling i think i should come with you to rome and just confront him
ripley lights a cigarette
marge loses confidence
marge contd he hates being confronted
i think youre right
ripleys battered cases are carried into the tiny lobby of this small hotel
he exchanges his passport at the desk for his room key then makes his way carrying his own luggage to the metal cage elevator
this scene intercuts with dickies array of leather luggage is pulled along on a baggage trolley by a liveried porter
dickies passport slides across the marble desk
a key comes back collected by a hand sporting dickies two distinctive rings
as aldo the front desk manager inspects the passport he looks at the owner
ripley wears a terrific suit his hair parted in the greenleaf style no glasses
his voice when he speaks has the same lazy confident drawl
welcome back signor greenleaf
walking away thank you
the porter takes the cases and opens them as ripley walks around the suite
its large and splendid
ripley breathes in its opulence
he immediately picks up the telephone
yes id like you to telephone the hotel goldoni
i want to speak to signor thomas ripley no ipley r yes
he produces dickies pen and signs the blotter quickly greenleaf then he pulls out a postcard from the writing case to reveal dickies stars hide your fires handwriting specimen
he compares the two signatures is pleased
the telephone rings
ripley contd pronto
signor ripley is not there
id like to leave a message
please call dickie dickie greenleaf at the grand
a tiny cell of a room single bed
ripley on the phone
hes not there
ill leave a message got your call
dinner tonight sounds fine
ripley listens as its read back dinner tonight yes is okay
yes thank you
ripley has bought some more leather goods a briefcase and overnight bag
he is at the counter signing checks
id like these to have my initials embossed i dont know the word in italian
embossed of course signor greenleaf
theres an excited rap on the window and a shout of dickie
shocked ripley looks over to find meredith logue outside alone and delighted to see him
he grins and mouths hello
entering the shop dickie
oh my god
ripley and meredith walk across the piazza towards the cafe
but youre going skiing with us yankees arent you
to cortina with freddie miles and interrupting astonished how did you know that
everybody knows freddie miles
unsettled is freddie in rome
i dont think so
but ive met him of course and weve chatted and i know about you and marge and mongi and what an unreliable rat you are
freddie said you were a rat and i thought to myself now i know why he travels under r
ive left marge meredith
so the rats here now in rome
sorry i wouldnt have made a joke if dont be sorry
ive never been happier
i feel like ive been handed a new life
meredith and ripley walk down the spanish steps and head inside the office
the truth is if youve had money your entire life even if you despise it which we do agreed
youre only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it
ive never admitted that to anyone
ripleys signing dickies allowance receipt
meredith is with him signing her own counterfoil
he is of course endorsed by her presence
she goes to the window ahead of him
she takes her money turns to him
he hands over his documents
the clerk compares ripleys signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at him
ripley is cool as a cucumber
i dont want too many large bills
nobody will change them
where a tailor is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket for ripley
bolts of cloth everywhere as meredith adjudicates the possible materials which the tailor holds up against ripley
show me the other one again
the tailor obliges i like them both
ill take them both
ripley goes inside the bedroom to change
while hes inside meredith shows the tailor out
as she returns she notices the open sax case peers inside
i know youre a jazz fiend but do you absolutely hate the opera
ive been trying to give my tickets away its tomorrow but if you were prepared to be dragged
she looks up to catch him bare chested
shes intoxicated by him the romance she feels to be in the air
emerging you could drag me
on stage is act two of eugene onegin
lensky sings his aria before the duel with onegin
ripleys in a tuxedo in a box which includes a glamorous meredith and her aunt and uncle
he knows what comes next
lensky is shot by onegin
blood pours from his neck into the snow
onegin horrified at the death of his friend goes over wraps lensky in his cloak the silk lining flashing kneels holding him
ripley can barely hide his emotion
meredith watches her sensitive friend entranced
ripley and meredith exit their box with merediths aunt and uncle who heads for the interval drinks
thanks so much for inviting me tonight
can you bear it
we hear youre a friend of freddies he has i hate opera tattooed on his chest
theres room for a whole libretto on freddies chest
laughs im sure weve met
they reach the console where uncle ted has their drinks
joan contd i was sure wed met werent you ted
this is herbert greenleafs boy
thanks yes i think we did
one minute you people are children and the next youre getting tattooed
ripley heads past the beautiful people on his hunt for the mens room and walks straight into a young and cultured englishman
they greet each other and suddenly marge is beside them
as if shes seen a ghost oh my god
marge how are you
what are you doing in rome
is he here
are you with dickie
to smith kingsley hello im tom ripley
peter smith kingsley

i was looking forward to rowing you around
i really am

well hurry before we sink
reaches into his jacket should i give you my telephone number in venice
the interval bells ringing
peter hands over his card to ripley sees meredith
look theres meredith thingy whos that marge
theyre in textiles
meredith embarrassed at not remembering god how awful ive spent christmas in her house
i dont know her
to ripley he hasnt called hes hardly written just these cryptic notes

theres a mini stampede to return
will we see you later
i cant later
do you know dinellis
piazza di spagna
i know the piazza di spagna
well be there
marge see you tomorrow
to peter its really good to meet you
ripley goes straight to meredith and grabs her
i thought you were enjoying yourself
lets take a carozza and look at the moon
its freezing out there
hes looking past her where a mirror reflects marge wading through the audience peters elegant head getting dangerously near as they approach their seats
cmon i need to talk to you
just the two of us
quite taken okay then youre crazy
meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the tiber
ripley as dickie is confessing his heart belongs to marge
youre such a pal to understand
its as if marge is here now i look at you and i see her face and i cant whatever im feeling towards you i just cant
no i absolutely understand
otherwise youd be fighting me off
beating you away
they arrive at the courtyard outside merediths apartment building
ripley jumps down collects her
she makes to go inside then looks at him
will you meet me tomorrow
just to say goodbye in the daylight properly
so its not just this its too
you should always save pain for daylight
oh meredith im sorry
of course ill meet you
lets have coffee in the morning at dinellis
fluttering i dont is that by the spanish steps
instantly correcting himself
he gets back into the carozza
it moves off
meredith sits waiting in a cafe at the bottom of the spanish steps
ripley dressed as ripley is at the top of the steps among early tourists watching as she drinks her coffee at an outside table
then marge and peter appear walking up the via condotti head for another table dont see meredith
she acknowledges peter who hasnt noticed her
hello its meredith logue
of course it is meredith hello im sorry half asleep how are you
this is marge sherwood
hearing marges name meredith reacts freezes
join us wont you
were just waiting for a friend
do you know i wonder did we see you at the opera last night
i wont actually although i think this might are you waiting for dickie
well no as it happens although
stunned at the mention of his name dickie
do you know dickie
you were at the opera
well that explains yes i was there
i was there with dickie
to peter i told you
i knew it
moving over to them marge i dont know you so i have no right but dickie loves you
hes i think youll find hes coming home to you
proprietorial how would you know that
he told me everything
i was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago so i
im going to go now i think
unless he meant us to meet which would be a little cruel wouldnt it
no were meeting another friend
do you know tom
i heard about him of course but no i didnt meet him
the waiter has arrived to take orders
meredith indicates shes leaving
meredith contd not for me
marge is on the edge
peter lays a hand to comfort her
meredith contd i hope i didnt complicate matters but nothing nothing untoward happened nothing to prevent you from welcoming him back from marrying him
goodbye peter please dont get up
peter gets up
ripley from his vantage point at the top of the steps watches meredith leave and walk off into the crowd
he begins the slow walk down towards the square
as he becomes visible to the cafe he starts to hurry
hes apologising to marge and peter as they see him in his element lying and believing in his lie
had to renew my papers
italian bureaucracy never one stamp when they can make you line up for three
have you been waiting long
not at all
to marge sorry
you look as if youve seen a ghost
dickie was at the opera last night
i dont believe it
wild horses wouldnt drag dickie to he was there with someone
so i suppose she must have dragged him thats not fair
im going back to mongi
i think dickies coming home
to peter im going to go home
no i was just youre way ahead of me
we think hes had a change of heart
to marge so we should be celebrating
i hope so
to marge that was moving wasnt it
when meredith said to ripley merediths the american girl i saw last night i know her at the opera shes been seeing something of dickie my god
but the point is dickie well we know this dickie loves marge and he misses her and apparently hes come to his senses
to peter i feel guilty
marge doesnt understand this but anytime dickie does something i feel guilty
ripley is being shown an apartment for rent in the palazzo gioia by a dry witted older woman signora buffi
ripley explores relishing the decor
accendo il riscaldamento
ill turn the heating on
mimes playing sax mi piace suonare
i like to play music
shrugs io sono sorda
quelli di sotto una coppia sono sordi
allora ti piace
the couple below are deaf
so do you like it
ripley is in the apartment fire burning wearing pyjamas
theres a small christmas tree
he kneels on the floor with some festive gift wrapped packages
he opens a package
its a marble head of hadrian
a gasp from ripley
he picks up a glass pours himself a drink
ripley plunges into bachs italian concerto on his new and precious toy a steinway grand
his doorbell rings
he stops playing
he doesnt get visitors
he rises a little nervous
who is it
let me in
ripley almost collapses
dickie come on its me
ripley cant think what to hide where to hide
he opens the door
hello freddie its tom tom ripley
confused not pleasantly oh hello wheres dickie
how are you
yes im good thank you
dickies at dinner
hes at otellos
do you know it
i dont think hes at dinner at
if you said he was still at lunch id believe you
the guy has disappeared off the face of the earth
the landlady as far as i could tell the landlady said he was here right now
hes gone to dinner
search the place
i cant think why you would imagine dickie would hide from you
because hes been hiding from me what happened at christmas
what about christmas
he was supposed to come skiing
i didnt get a cable or a call or a note or frankly a fart
ripley has his hands behind his back
hes tugging frantically at dickies rings
ripley wanders into the kitchen turns on the tap to sluice his fingers
of course hes been very involved in his music hasnt he
i think his theory is you know you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly
which is horseshit
have you heard him play that thing
gesturing at the sax on its stand he cant
casually how did you find him
its such an out of the way apartment
can i fix you a drink
explaining his detective work some kid at the american express office
he starts to explore are you living here
now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie woogie on the piano
returning flinching no
no im staying here for a few days in rome
thats a new piano so you prob did this place come furnished
it doesnt look like dickie
horrible isnt it
now hes poking at the hadrian bust
you should watch that
in fact the only thing which looks like dickie is you
have you done something to your hair
ripley starts to smile his eyes darting around the room
freddie do you have something to say
i think im saying it
somethings going on
hes either converted to christianity or to something else
i suggest you ask dickie that yourself
otellos is on delle croce just off the corso
is it on delle croce just off the corso youre a quick study arent you
last time you didnt know your ass from your elbow now youre giving me directions
thats not fair you probably do know your ass from your elbow
ill see you
and hes gone
ripley shuts the door smooths the silk runner on the table where freddies hand had rucked it
he goes back to the door opens it and looks over the rail
freddie is back in conversation with signora buffi
ripley cant make out the text but theres some discussion about signor greenleaf and signor ripley ripley hurries inside as freddies heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again
freddie knocks on the door which pushes open
as he marches in he launches into his interrogation
theres someth freddie falls like an ox first to his knees groaning then to the floor as ripley brings the head down again beating him downwards
as freddie slumps away ripley loses his balance and the head sends freddie a glancing blow before slipping from ripleys grasp and smashing on to the floor
ripley hauls freddie out of the shadows towards the car
a couple walk across the square
ripley talks to freddie berating him for his drunken stupor
he pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat
mimicking freddies voice hey if im drunk think what her husbands saying
the fiat noses along the appian way
black fragments of tombs punctuate either side of the poorly lit road
inside the car ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body
he slows near a clump of trees
someone is knocking urgently at the door
ripley opens it finds himself face to face with signora buffi and two policemen
one of them offers his hand
can we come in
ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table
roverini and his sergeant baggio watch patiently
its a terrible shock eh
what time did signor miles leave yesterday
i cant be absolutely sure
wed both taken on far too many drinks but it was dark it was certainly dark when i walked him down to his car
so signor miles drove away and you did what
i went to bed
freddies a big man but im in trouble after a couple of drinks
ive suffered all day
who found him
roverini has walked over to the bust of hadrian
we have to ask you to stay in rome
yes if its going to help certainly
so the doctor he has to make the looks at baggio come se dice
yes exactly but his first his first conclusion was that signor miles was killed not later than seven oclock yesterday evening
well he certainly wasnt dead when he drove off in his car
ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the ghetto on his scooter
he drives past a furniture store dressing tables and mirrors spilling out onto the street
he glances sideways sees his reflection fractured into several images and for an instant it seems as if dickies there watching him
ripley screams and swerves crashing into the pavement the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along the cobbled passage
the man he thought to be dickie an italian runs up concerned
ripley emerges from the american express office
across the street at the cafe as once before sits marge
ripley slips dickies bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter
marge spots him and strides across the piazza
she is in no mood for pleasantries
did he kill freddie
marge when did you get here
tell me the truth
did he kill freddie
id swear he didnt
of course he didnt
i tried again waiting here watching for him
instead its you
whenever i look for dickie i find you
focusing on ripleys cuts and bruises what happened to your face
dickie did it
suddenly tense dickie
there was an argument
i said some things i shouldnt have
about the appalling way hes treating you all of us
and the next thing i know hes launched himself at me
he pulls the scooter off the stand are you getting on
ill take you to him
ripley and marge come round the corner on the scooter
the entrance to the palazzo is blocked by a couple of police cars
inspector roverini emerges from one of them
ripley startled drives straight past the entrance
ripley pulls up several hundred yards later in a different piazza full of book stalls
marge is confused
where does dickie live
we passed it a few blocks back where the police were
the palazzo gioia
they dont even know im in rome and im not going to incriminate dickie perhaps i shouldnt go either
thinking hard distracted no well go if you want to but dont talk to the police about my face they find out he hit me hes got a temper he
couldve hit freddie
sincerely good luck marge
ill catch up with you later
and he drives off
at the first opportunity he doubles back and roars towards the palazzo
ripley drives towards the entrance
as ripley gets off and pushes his scooter through the doorway some journalists loitering inside a barbers shop come running out and swarm around him with questions about freddie
one of them gets off a photograph
its chaos a police officer shouts him away as ripley puts up a protective hand and runs inside
as ripley hurries inside he encounters officers conducting more thorough forensic investigations in the stairwell
on a landing is roverini
ripley hurries towards him
can we go up
do you mind
what happened to your face
i fell off
getting chased by photographers
he hurries up the stairs roverini in tow
ripley contd agitated the telephone the press ive been im feeling hounded do you think you could not give out my address
weve had many requests and of course we say no even to your fiancee
i really dont want to see anybody
even your fiancee
what about thomas ripley
what about ripley
ripleys way ahead and has reached the door of his apartment
he waits nervously for roverini
he unlocks the door and can barely wait for roverini to catch up
roverini follows ripley inside baggio hurries in behind him
you and signor ripley went to san remo is that right
ripley is appalled
yes sure we did go to san remo
that was months ago
november i thought
did you speak to tom
november th is my information
i dont remember the exact date
and when did you last see signor ripley
a few days ago
does he stay with you here
here is a pattern
two days ago freddie miles is dead he leaves your apartment and is murdered
yesterday a little boat is found in san remo full of rocks and the owner tells the police it was stolen on november th
we look at hotel records and we see oh
dickie greenleaf is staying in san remo and then our boatman remembers two americans taking a boat
its not a pattern its a coincidence
there must be fifty hotels in san remo there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day
speaks to roverini
ripley is getting cranky
that is miss sherwood now
appalled defeated let her in whats the difference
let her in
baggio is on his way to the door
no actually no id like it very much if you would ask her to come back later
roverini nods mutters to baggio who heads out
ripley contd thank you
watching him may i ask
why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancee
i think i just said
ripley was handling some business for me nor does mr ripley want to marry me
nor did he ask me every day if i would marry him
do you have a photograph of signor ripley
im not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends
now i think i have upset you
my english perhaps is coarse
it is a little coarse yes
no one has seen signor ripley since san i have
you have yes
no i have and so has miss sherwood ask her
and if i could remember which hotel he was staying at the goldoni
tom was staying at the goldoni
yes youre right
he gets up to leave i look forward to our next meeting when i will be more careful with my english and persuade you to play me your saxophone
suddenly turning i have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into mr miles car
she wants to identify you in a confronto line up
ominously tomorrow then
thrown scrabbling tomorrow
ripley lets them out heaves a heavy sigh then peeps through the door looks down to see roverini speaking to marge on the stairs
buongiorno miss sherwood
hes in but i really dont think he wants to see anyone
ripley leans against the door the noose tightening then suddenly a voice shocks him upright
i know you can hear me
what am i doing chasing you around
i was going to say i would count to three and if you didnt open the door but i wont count any more
i wont count on you any more
whatever it is whatever youve done or havent done youve broken my heart
thats one thing i know youre guilty of and i dont know why i dont know why i just dont know why
ripley listens theres a silence then marges footsteps as they ring out on the stone stairs
the tapping sound resolves into the tap tap of a manual typewriter
ripleys at the typewriter he begins to type
my dear tom im getting out of this
freddies death silvana
ive thought about going to the police but i cant do it i cant face it
i cant face anything anymore
ripley is working quickly selecting clothes dividing them into two piles one for dickies trunk one for his own battered suitcase
he puts the license plates from freddies car in dickies luggage
he has placed one shirt on the ripley pile then checks again and on seeing dickies initials places it with the bigger pile then picks it up again and holds
it briefly against his cheek
he takes dickies rings opens up a little box of buttons and needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in
dickies leather writing case goes on the big pile too as do cuff links ties the mont blanc dickies passport which he opens to scratch at the photograph obliterating the
i wish i could give you the life i took for granted
youve always understood whats at the heart of me tom
marge never could
i suppose thats why im writing this to you the brother i never had
the only true friend i ever had
in all kinds of ways youre much more like the son my father always wanted
i realise you can change the people change the scenery but you cant change your own rotten self
now i cant think what to do or where to go
im haunted by everything ive done and cant undo
im sorry i cant go on
ive made a mess of being dickie greenleaf havent i
hes finished the letter signs it puts it in an envelope marked tom ripley and places the letter on top of the piano next to dickies passport
his head is reflected in the distorting curve of the lid
as he puts on his glasses theres a moment when there are two heads slowly separating as ripley leaves behind his brief life as dickie greenleaf
ripley carries dickies luggage down into the communal basement of the gioia a wretched place full of shadows and gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments
a red plush couch sits on top of a mound of furniture
he finds some dustsheets and shoves the cases under them
then dickies saxophone
outside the small window ripley sees uniformed feet and the revolving blue light of a police car
he shrinks back turns off the light and disappears into the dark illuminated fitfully by the strobe of cold blue
ripley familiar battered luggage in tow appears at the entrance of the building next to his own glances at the police car parked opposite the big doors then hurries off
into the darkness
ripleys briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley hurrying towards a gate and disappears behind it
ripley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a motor taxi as it surges towards venice at dawn
peter smith kingsley waits on the quay
peter waves back
indicating the taxi stop ill see you over there
ripley and peter walk through the square the pigeons scattering
ripley breathes in the atmosphere the beautiful grey
peter im really sorry to put you through this
i just couldnt face going to the police by myself when my italians so rotten
dont be daft
im delighted you finally made it to venice
im delighted contrary to rumour youre still in one piece
that dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport
i know ridiculous
ripley sits in the middle of a bustling police station where thefts tourists thieves and complaints are being processed
the station is in an old brewery or armory
its a horrible monochrome oppressive place
peter is in conversation at a desk turns and walks over to where ripley waits
welcome to venice
this place reeks doesnt it
can you smell it
not the best way to spend your first day
anyway ive got to the bottom of the delay
were waiting for someone from rome
completely thrown what do you mean
theyre sending someone from rome
thats good isnt it
as if suffocating no but i thought that didnt happen in italy that each region was completely separate
i was sure that was the youve seen the papers you know what a big deal its been here
american tourist murdered its ridiculous but now youve mentioned the stench i can hardly breathe
a door opens
colonel verrecchia fresh from rome and a sullen wedge of a man comes in scowling at the couple
ripley dare not look up in case its roverini
a policeman introduces him
colonelo verrecchia della polizia di roma
to peter in italian qui e ripley
who is ripley
in italian lui
verrecchia strides past them and into a smaller interview room at the back of the station
his manner is ominous
this room is not at all friendly
there is evidence of a locked area for cells at one wall
a small sour window gives onto a canal
the main station is glimpsed through some internal windows
peter and ripley come through
verrecchia sits down
verrecchia talks in staccato italian during which peter translates
ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire
il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor greenleaf il quale era lunica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor miles
translating hes taken over the case because
theyre annoyed the previous chap let dickie
disappear when he was the only he was the only suspect in freddies murder
quando e stata lultima volta che il signor ripley ha visto il signor greenleaf
when was the last time ripley saw greenleaf
ripley forgets hes not supposed to have much italian and answers
in rome about three weeks ago
shrugs i knew that one
giving ripley a look a roma circa tre settimane fa
dove e stato il signor ripley da allora
translating where have you been since then
ive been backpacking
i dont know how to translate that
he tries e difficile
il signor ripley dormiva allaperto con un
col freddo che ha fatto
he thinks its very cold to be sleeping outside
il signor ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali
are you a homosexual
then as himself interesting non sequitur
translates for him no
as peter drily by the way officially there are no italian homosexuals
makes leonardo michelangelo very inconvenient
tell him i have a fiancee dickie has a fiancee and freddie miles probably had a string of them
translating il signor ripley ha una fidanzata il signor dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor freddie miles ha molte fidanzate
laughs mamma mia quante fidanzate
they all laugh
what did he say
he says so many fiancees suddenly very tough lei ha ucciso prima freddie miles e dopo dickie greenleaf
as peter translates verrecchia watches intently
he wants to know if you killed freddie miles and then killed dickie greenleaf
outraged no i did not
i did not kill freddie miles and then kill dickie greenleaf
is he accusing me
peter clearly doesnt ask ask him if hes accusing me
hes already angry i dont think interrupting heated just because he doesnt like americans
non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private
this is not the place for your private conversations appeasing him a ragione
verrecchia hands over a letter
ripleys name on the outside
ripley stares at it
contd questa lettera e stata trovata nellabitazione del signor richard greenleaf a roma
they found this in dickies place in rome
you opened this
he stands and takes the letter out
begins to read
he has the look of a man whose privacy has been violated
to peter its a suicide note
to verrecchia you ask me all these questions and youve already read this suicide note
theres music everywhere and stands and posters of performances and photographs of peter conducting
peter is an opera repetiteur
ripley is sitting at peters piano playing from the score of vivaldis stabat mater peters made supper
hes setting the table
can you imagine if dickie did kill freddie what must that be like
to wake up every morning how can you
just wake up and be a person drink a coffee
whatever you do however terrible however hurtful it all makes sense doesnt it
inside your head
you never meet anybody who thinks theyre a bad person or that theyre cruel
but youre still tormented you must be youve killed somebody
dont you put the past in a room in the cellar and lock the door and just never go in there
because thats what i do
in my case its probably a whole building
then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key say open up step inside but you cant because its dark and there are
demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was
peters come over stands behind him over the piano
thats the music talking
harder to be bleak if youre playing knees up mother brown he vamps this vaudeville song over ripleys shoulder
i keep wanting to do that fling open the door let the light in clean everything out
if i could get a huge eraser and rub everything out
starting with myself
the thing is peter if
as ripley falls silent no key huh
a young boy sings the soprano part of vivaldis stabat mater
a piercingly pure sound in vivaldis own church
the orchestra rehearsing is conducted by peter from the organ
ripley slips in at the back of the church
he stands and listens
peter sees him smiles
ripley smiles back
marge appears on the steps carrying an overnight bag
ripley and peter have come to meet her
kissing him warmly hello peter so good to see you
they walk towards the vaporetto
marge contd so you found peter
i think we sort of found each other
marge smiles enigmatically
peter contd wheres dickies father
hes not coming till the morning
evidently his stomach i dont think the food here is agreeing with him
i was looking forward to seeing him
dickie hasnt killed himself
im sure of that
theres a private detective on the case now a mr maccarron dickies fathers employing him
thats a terrific idea
hes already discovered dickie cashed checks for the day before he disappeared
they step onto the vaporetto
marge contd is that what you do before you jump in the tiber
i dont think so
the boat arrives at the entrance to the house
peter opens the door as ripley collects marges bags
to peter is this you
no its toms
whos paying for this
peter found it for me
i can afford it because its damp and and falling down
marge entering the living room is astonished at its grandeur
she walks around as ripley heads for the bar
this is spectacular
thats why tom wanted you to stay
its better than squeezing into my room and i know how you hate hotels
a hotel wouldve been fine
to ripley well have to tell mr greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched
ripley is shaking a martini
marge laughs helpless somehow raging
peter turns whats funny
im just thinking about when tom arrived in mongi
to ripley and now look at you
look at me what
to the manner born
st marks square is buzzing with life tourists balloon sellers a man playing saxophone
herbert greenleaf sits out in the colonade on one of the many tables at florians cafe cradling a glass of hot water
he gets up as marge and ripley arrive
how are you
you look well
im well thank you
far cry from new york
yes it is
marge good morning
and you sir
sticking with hot water
wheres mr maccarron
the police are amateurs
well my boy its come to a pretty pass hasnt it
whats the detective hoping to find in san remo
hes being thorough thats all
im learning about my son tom now hes missing
im learning a great deal about him
i hope you can fill in some more blanks for me
marge has been good enough to do that about mongibello
ill try my best sir
obviously ill do anything to help dickie
marge looks at him in contempt
this theory the letter he left for you the police think thats a clear indication he was planning on doing something
i just dont believe that
you dont want to dear
id like to talk to tom alone perhaps this afternoon
would you mind
marge what a man may say to his sweetheart and what hell admit to another fellow such as
what a waste of lives and opportunities and a saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza
greenleaf suddenly explodes
contd id pay that fellow a hundred dollars right now to shut up
herbert greenleaf sits on a chair ripley pours him some tea
reading plunging into gloom no marge doesnt know the half of it
i think it might hurt her to know
and his passport photo
did you hear
to scratch out your own face like that can you imagine the frame of mind youd have to be in
reading ive thought about going to the police but i cant face it
i cant face anything anymore
i feel guilty
i feel like i pushed him away
i spoke and he heard you
such a disappointed father well if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away
youve been a great friend to my son
everything is someone elses fault
we all want to sow wild oars
somebodys got to whats the word
ripley shakes his head the moment someone confronts him he lashes out
he lashes out
you know people always say you cant choose your parents but you cant choose your children
ripley wakes up from an awful chilling nightmare his head full of ghosts
hes cramped up in an armchair his arms in sine foetal protection
his door knocker is being repeatedly shaken
he surfaces thickly stumbles to the door
its peter and marge
i was asleep
i must have fallen asleep
you look ghastly tom
are you okay
did dickies dad go
hes having an early night
she heads to her room we were knocking on that door for ever
she fiddles inside the sleeve of her dress i think ive broken my strap
ill fix some drinks
you walk in venice
she takes off her shoe examining her feet for wear and tear then disappears into the bedroom
peter walks over to ripley a little concerned
are you okay
a hand on his shoulder do you want me to stick around
or i could come back
ripley looks at him
thats never happened
he digs in his pocket finds his key gives it to peter
peter contd your key
ripleys in the bath
marge knocks on his door
marge im in the bath
wont be long
tom i need to talk to you
ripley irritated opens the door his towel wrapped around his waist
marge is white
shes wearing a robe
shes slightly breathless
i found dickies rings
youve got dickies rings
i can explain
his eyes dart
marge holds up the evidence
dickie promised me he would never take off this ring
let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this
i have to tell mr greenleaf
i have to tell mr greenleaf
i have to tell mr greenleaf
marge calm down youre being hysterical
he promised me
i swear ill never take off this ring until the day shut up
his towel slips off from his waist
ripley contd im wet marge ive lost my towel id really like to put my clothes on
so go and pour us both a drink will you
she goes off obediently a zombie
he shuts the door
immediately he starts looking for something anything to kill marge with
hes got a shoe but it feels too light
he opens cabinets drawers nail scissors nothing then picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror
marge is leaving coat on as ripley comes out of the bathroom
where are you going
like a creature caught in headlights i was looking for a needle and thread
i wasnt snooping
i was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra
the scent youre wearing
bought it for you not dickie
the thing about dickie
so many things
the day he was late back from rome i tried to tell you this he was with another girl
im not talking about meredith another girl we met in a bar
he couldnt be faithful for five minutes
so when he makes a promise it doesnt mean what it means when you make a promise
or i do
he has so many realities dickie and he believes them all
he lies thats his
half the time he doesnt even realize
a small red stain is appearing on the pocket of his robe
as he speaks the stain spreads
he looks at it absently
ripley contd today for the first time ive even wondered whether he might have killed freddie
he would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him well you know that
i loved you you might as well know i loved you and because he knew i loved you he let you think i loved him
didnt you see couldnt you see
i dont know maybe its grotesque to say this now so just write it on a piece of paper or something and keep it in your purse for a rainy
tom loves me
as if shed heard nothing why do you have dickies rings
his hand goes to his pocket
hes going to have to do it
i told you
he gave them to me
i feel as if you havent heard anything ive been saying to you
i dont believe you
its all true
i dont believe a single word youve said
marge is shivering
ripley ominous advances she retreats
youre shivering marge
can i hold you
would you let me hold you
marge panics backed up against the door
she screams and turns straight into the arms of a startled peter whos come back to visit ripley and is unlocking the door
sobbing uncontrollably oh peter
get me out of here
ripley storms off
his hand comes out of his pocket covered in blood from the razor
peter notices appalled
tom are you okay
you try talking to her
calls after him tom
tell me whats going on
not turning around i give up
peter has just put a band aid over ripleys cut hand
you cant be angry with her
shes upset and needs someone to blame
so she blames you
ill go home and talk to her
as for you either get a safety razor or grow a beard
ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance
ripley knocks on the door
its opened by a face he doesnt recognize
a middle aged heavy set man
its maccarron the private investigator
is mr greenleaf here
im alvin maccarron
i dont know i dont know i just know it
marge theres female intuition and then there are facts greenleaf sits with a scrubbed marge her hair pulled back as if newly widowed
the rings sit glinting on the coffee tom
smiles thinly at marge marge you should have waited didnt peter tell you id come by and pick you up
marge has been telling us about the rings
you know i feel ridiculous i didnt mention them yesterday i clean forgot ridiculous
perhaps you didnt mention them because theres only one conclusion to be drawn
ripley worries about what that conclusion is as mr greenleaf heads into his bedroom
contd im going to take marge for a little walk tom
mr maccarron wants to talk with you
feeling caged in we could go down to the bar no need for you to no he should talk to you alone
he helps marge to her feet and leads her out
ripley is paralysed
he waits for the door to shut
aimlessly he walks out onto the terrace with its staggering beautiful and indifferent view
ripley stands steels himself for maccarrons charges
i could probably see my bedroom from here
i can see my house
when you see where you live from a distance its like a dream isnt it
coming out i dont care for b
i dont care to hear it
i dont care to speak it
why do you think dickies father sent him to europe in the first place
did you know at princeton dickie greenleaf half killed a boy
ripley turns shocked
contd at a party
over some girl
he kicked the kid several times in the head
put him in the hospital
the boy had a wire fixed in his jaw
the rome police didnt think to ask mr greenleaf
maccarron gets up
contd nor did they think to check whether a thomas ripley had ever been a student at princeton university
i turned up a tom ripley whod been a piano tuner in the music department
ripleys head drops
contd see in america were taught to check a fact before it becomes a fact
were taught to nose around when a girl drowns herself find out if that girl was pregnant find out if dickie had an embarrassment there
ripley doesnt know where this barrage is going
contd mr greenleaf appreciates your loyalty
he really does
marge shes got a hundred theories but there are a few things she doesnt know
we hope she never knows
i hope she never knows
three different people saw dickie get into freddie miles car
a man who wont identify himself because he was jumping someone elses wife at the time saw dickie removing license plates from a red sports car
the police know about this man because he happens to be a policeman
he walks out of the room returns carrying the license plates from freddies car
contd i found these in the basement of dickies apartment
they belonged to freddies car
mr greenleaf has asked me to lose them in the canal this evening
ripley cant believe what hes hearing
its like a dream
contd mr greenleaf also feels there was a silent promise in dickies letter to you which he intends to honor
he intends to transfer a good part of dickies income from his trust into your name
he doesnt intend to give the italian police any information about dickies past
hes rather hoping youll feel the same
there is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed
ripley stands with marge mr greenleaf and maccarron at the waters edge motor launch growling
they shake hands and then maccarron and mr greenleaf get into the launch
herbert greenleaf carries the saxophone case
to marge i feel i never should have said those things to you the other evening
i was pretty flustered the rings and and you looked so i dont know
marge shakes her head to silence him
ripley contd but i hope that note goes to new york in your purse for a rainy day
what are you going to do now tom
i dont know
peter has a concert in athens next month and hes asked if i want to go along help out
he says goodbye by the way hes in rehearsal otherwise why do i think theres never been a ripley rainy day
lunging at him i know it was you i know it was you tom
i know it was you
i know you killed dickie
i know it was you
he puts his hand out to control her
she pushes it away
starts to lash out at him the frustration too much so that ripley has to cover his face
maccarron comes off the boat to restrain her
ripley looks at him as if to say what can you do shes hysterical
maccarron nods pulls her on to the boat
greenleaf catches ripleys eye guiltily
they stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off towards open waters passing the little fleets of gondolas
a week later and peter and ripley are on the deck of the ferry the hellenes as it sails towards greece
ask me what i want to change about this moment
what do you want to change about this moment
peters in a bathrobe organising his currency his travellers cheques
ripley knocks on the door comes in
what are you up to
all kinds of things
plans good plans for tonight or plans for the future
i dont know
my plan right now is to go up on deck look at the sunset
come with me
i dont want to get dressed yet
come back though
smiles at him you know you look so relaxed like a completely different person
well thats entirely your fault
and if i fall overboard thatll be your fault too
ripley stands on deck staring at the magnificent sunset
then a voice shakes him from his reverie
suddenly hes dickie
meredith contd dickie my god
i was looking at you your clothes i wouldnt have known you
well youve spotted me and so you get the reward
are you alone
i couldnt be less alone
meredith points to the upper deck balcony where two older couples are walking around the deck
a lot of co
oh god ive thought about you so much
ive thought about you
and now hes thinking i cant kill them all
when i thought about you i was mostly hating you
whereve you been hiding
i havent been hiding
ive been in police custody
theyve been trying to flush out freddies killer
theyre letting me have this vacation
which is why the get up
which is why you havent heard from me
you know the whole world thinks you killed freddie
look i cant talk now
he kisses her
full of future
so are you travelling under r
you know what i am
dickie are you with peter smith kingsley
i bet you are
my aunt thought she saw him
horrified peter smith kingsley
i havent seen him in months
no im alone
and he understands this is not any kind of lie peters working on his score lying on his front apparently engrossed
ripley knocks and enters
looks long at peter
how was it
but i think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip
was that meredith
sighs was who meredith
you were kissing somebody
looked like meredith
didnt look that way you know from a distance
she thought shed seen you
dickie and peter thats just too good gossip isnt it
or tom and peter even
well that would be even better gossip
completely lost sorry im completely lost
im lost too
im going to be stuck in the basement arent i thats my thats my terrible and alone and dark and ive lied about who i am and where i am
and so nobody can ever find me
what do you mean lied about who you are
i suppose i always thought better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody
what are you talking about youre not a nobody
thats the last thing you are
conciliatory and dont forget
i have the key
you have the key
tell me some good things about tom ripley
dont get up
just tell me some nice things
he sits on the bed leans against peter
his eyes are brimming with tears
he takes the cord from peters robe and begins twisting it in his hands
good things about tom ripley
could take some time
tom is talented
tom is tender
tom is beautiful
during this and tender youre such a liar
tom is a mystery
ripley is pressing against him moving up his body kisses his shoulder the cord wrapped tight in his hands
ripley returns to his cabin
sits on the bed desolate
contd tom is not a nobody
tom has secrets he doesnt want to tell me and i wish he would
tom has nightmares
thats not a good thing
tom has someone to love him
that is a good thing
feeling ripleys weight on him tom is crushing me
tom is crushing me
suddenly alarmed tom youre crushing me
the door of his closet flips open with the swell and he catches his reflection
it swings shut
open then shut
through the porthole the weathers changing as the light dies
theres a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the round glass
ripley alone in a nightmare of his own making
lullaby for cain from the silence from the night comes a distant lullabye cry remembering that first cry your brother standing by and loved both loved beloved sons of mine
sing a lullabye mother is close by innocent eyes such innocent eyes envy stole your brothers life came home murdered peace of mind left you nightmares on the pillow sleep now soul surrendering your soul the heart of you not whole for love but love what toll cast into the dark branded with the mark of shame of cain from the garden of gods light to a wilderness of light sleep now sleep now
