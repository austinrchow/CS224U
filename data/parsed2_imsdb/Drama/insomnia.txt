on credit sequence
long alabaster white
a wash cloth enters frame
starts washing the arm with long tender strokes
thick and auburn
being gently washed
being clipped with a shiny nail clipper
brown with a touch of gold
a brush comes into view
brushes against the eyebrow hair then back again
then back again
pulled gingerly off a long leg
the wash cloth begins between the toes
warm soapy water
the hand appears with a comb
pulls down through the thick tresses
it is only now that we see the hand is wearing a surgical the gloved hand holds up the comb and pulls stray hairs from it
places them in a big clear plastic bag
in the bag we see the panty hose a folded flower dress the nail clippings
goes back to combing
comes across a knot and yanks the comb through
the head rolls over to us
her face is bruised her eyes blank
she is lying on the floor
end of credit sequence
the loud thrum of a bush plane
we close on a small cloudy window
through it we see an endless expanse of pine trees
just look at all that
pull back to reveal hap eckhart and will dormer sitting side by side
haps at the window
greying moustache a little pudgy wearing a brown suit
holding a folded over seattle times
hap contd i thought we had a population problem
everyone should just move up here
taps window just look at it will
wills eyes remain on the file on his lap
i dont need to look at it
tall handsome expensively tailored suit
snakeskin cowboy boots
theres both a magnetism and a distance to him
an intense mixture
hap glances at him
nothing wrong with smelling the roses
will looks up
we see the trace of a thick ropy scar by his adams apple
theres tension between him and hap just below the surface
he taps the file
tell that to her partner
a stack of x photographs
of the dead girl
her eyes puffed up from bruises
the whites bloody
contusions along her breasts and shoulders
the pilots looking back at will
wearing a leather red baron hat
pilot contd better check your belts
well be landing in about fifteen minutes
the plane lurches
the file falls to the floor and the photographs scatter
the pilot catches a glimpse of them
looks at will
the small yellow plane veers left
clears a mountain top and gives view to the spectacular alaskan coastline
the green of the bering sea the blanket of pine trees the jagged rock of the beaches
a sign swinging in the wind nightmute alaska
halibut fishing capital of the world
pull back to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small corrugated building
nothing else for miles around
a mud splattered jeep cherokee pulls up next to it
a young woman hops out
petite with short brown hair
peers up at the sky
brightens at the sight of the bush plane coming in for landing
smooths down her down vest
making sure the gold shield on her belts visible
ellie burr turns
shields her eyes from the sun
an old man hosing down the side of the building
whatre you doing here
ellie puffs up
the old man screws up his face confused
angstrom contd didnt you used to baby sit for us
i dont babysit any more mr
just made detective three weeks ago
a cat jumps down off the roof
angstrom sprays it
boy charlie must be short handed down at the station
ellie used to not being taken seriously
turns back to the roar of the bush plane as it taxis down the strip
coming to a stop
she hurries over as the door swings open and
will dormer steps down
slipping on his sunglasses
scanning the nothingness around him
spots the swinging sign
halibut fishing capital of the world
hap right behind him
rubs his neck
this ought to be interesting
over the engine detective dormer
they look down
ellie reaches up and takes wills bag
then his hand
shakes it vigorously
ellie contd its a huge honor to meet you

takes wills briefcase

theodore dineli frank and casey prudhomme the port angeles shootings

ellie contd and especially the leland street murders

the pilot walks by
taps her on the shoulder

she looks back at will
cant help but focus in on his scar
touches her own smooth neck
ellie contd thats where ronald langley cut you in the basement of his fathers house on leland isnt it
will smiles taken aback by this girls exuberance
you did your homework officer
she throws a quick glance at angstrom
out of ear shot
i just made detective three weeks ago
the cherokee parked next to a police car outside a plain one storey building
the nightmute police department
a totem pole stands out front
nightmute police chief charles nyback gets up from behind his desk with a big smile
ruddy red hair sprinkled with grey nyback wears a faded army sweater over his uniform
ill be damned
limps from behind his desk and gives will a shake and a slap on the back
warmly how you doing charlie
nyback shakes haps hand
i havent seen you boys since
just after leland street

down at his boots
chief nyback contd you havent changed a bit will

he starts back over to his desk
notices ellie still standing by the door
points to will
chief nyback contd pay attention to this man ellie
hell teach you how to be a great cop
looks over at will
thats all for now
ellie realises they want to be alone
quietly closing the door behind her
will unbuttons his jacket
takes a seat
sits with a sigh got a love affair with police work
drives me crazy with it
will surveys the fishing poles leaning against the gun rack
keeping you busy up here charlie
hap picks up a cheap trophy
reads the base
nd prize great kodiak salmon catch
i told you seven years ago this was a stepping stone to retirement
nyback nods to haps seattle times
the headline deeper investigation into special branch
chief nyback contd looks like its a good time for you to get up here too
with all the bad business going on down at special branch
will and hap share a look
no more joking
hap folds over the paper
chief nyback contd just five bad apples so far

theyre all over us charlie
theyre all over everybody
s calling themselves the corruption task force
can you believe that
trying to root out any mistakes or oversights any other detectives may have made over the years
theyre turning it into a witch hunt
something on the news about it practically every night
nyback pulls a stack of messages from his desk
got a bunch of messages here from some guy named warfield
hap tosses a glance over at will
s pit bull
wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here
nyback turns and ceremoniously drops the messages into the trash
chief nyback contd im just glad buck could spare you a couple of weeks
take you out of the frenzy
i gotta tell you though i sure dont miss big city police work
not that i was ever a great detective
but up here theres no bureaucracy
no public relations
no blurred lines
just good guys and bad guys
a cloud passes over his face
chief nyback contd except for this
holds up a file
the name written on the lip kay connell
nyback leads will and hap down a hallway
crooked plaques and black and white pictures line the walls
couldnt get a thing from the body
not a trace
towns never dealt with anything like this before
they turn a corner and stop at a door
will glances up moose antlers hanging over it
chief nyback contd ive briefed everybody about your coming
they know to follow your lead
nyback opens the door onto
the bullpen of nightmute pd
wooden desks a couple computers a jumbled corkboard an impressive gun cabinet
a radios playing
three men look over
a young uniformed cop and two guys with heavy facial hair timberland boots and flannel shirts
one of thems part inuit
ellie sits in the back
reaches over to turn off the radio
will and hap stand in the doorway
sticking out like sore thumbs in their suits
nyback jerks his thumb towards them
this is detective dormer and his partner detective eckhart
on loan from buck lundgard seattle robbery and homicide special branch
theyll be helping with the connell case
the inuit fred duggar snorts
takes his feet of the desk
ignoring him anything they need to see you show them anywhere they want to go you take them
nods to fred this is detective fred duggar
hes been leading the investigation up to now
will puts out his hand
fred tugs at his dark handlebar moustache
suppose you want to see the body
fred steps out of the station pulls on a baseball cap
we can walk from here
he heads off across the parking lot
will and hap exchange a glance
guess thats what they call alaskan hospitality
dont worry about him
ellies come up behind them
looks over at the hunched figure to fred
ellie contd hes just mad cause youre taking over
fred stops up ahead
go type something
close on a faucet
a bead of water quivering at the mouth
falls with a blip
did a fundascopic examination and found papilledema and petechiae of the retina
pull back to reveal will hap and the county coroner standing by a stainless steel table
the naked body of kay connell is laid out before them
fred hangs back
the coroner tugs at her surgical gloves
shes in her late seventies
coroner contd clear cause of death was herniation of the brain stem due to intracerebral hemorrhage
beaten to death
beaten to death
will points to the bruises on the bodys shoulders and breasts
what about these contusions
any signs of rape
the coroner starts to cover the body with a sheet
coroner contd she was a nice girl
played flute with my granddaughter
will stays her hand
he pulls the sheet back down
studying the body of kay connell
starts walking slowly around the table
in his element
the faucet drips
he bends down to smell her hair
will contd he washed her hair
takes a handful and lets it fall from his fingers
will contd combed it
continues around the table
picks up one of her hands
examines her fingers her nails
will contd cleaned under her fingernails

checks between her first and second toes
will contd toes too

no fibers skin flakes hairs
like i said no
we know about those things up here
will stands there
looking down at the body
skin like marble
he knew exactly what wed be looking for
made sure to cover up all his tracks
even the best make mistakes
will looks up and locks eyes with his partner
will and hap enter the lobby of the pioneer lodge
big stone fireplace and heavy ceiling beams
moose antlers mounted above reception
they put their bags down by the desk
lower forty eight
rachel clement stands in a doorway behind the desk
dunking a teabag into a mug
long dark hair and intelligent eyes
lower forty eight
youre not from here
i can tell by your walk
and hows that
hap smiles at her
will checks his watch
detectives will dormer and hap eckhart
there should be a reservation for us
rachel looks at him
goes to a small file box on the desk
to hap your friends all business
im always all business
he glances out the window
its as bright as day
will contd is it really
nods alaskan summers
hope youre an easy sleeper
itll be like this all night
she hands them two cards
rachel contd sign here
wills taken off his jacket and is unpacking
the room is sparse and creaky
bed dips in the middle
he hangs a jacket in the armoire then returns to his suitcase
pulls out his smith and wesson
lays it on the bedside table
takes out a shoulder holster
a back holster
a handful of shells
lays them on the table
then a small smith and wesson mm
checks the magazine
theres a knock on the adjoining door
will slaps the magazine back
come on in
hap opens the door
a glimpse into his room family pictures on his bedside table a woman and three teenage girls
see you have the same decor as my room
he walks over to the big window
it overlooks the harbor
big snow capped mountains in the distance
one lone tugboat in the harbor towing a freighter
hap contd same view too
looks out ive been watching that tugboat for the last half hour
so small pulling all that weight
beat we have to talk will
will reaches into his suitcase
pulls out a shirt
what do you want to talk about
you know what about
will throws him a look
well talk when we get back to seattle
whens that a week
heads over to him we have to figure out a plan of action now
you know my plan of action
to do nothing
warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday
asking all kinds of questions
hes asking everybody questions
but hes zeroing in on me
everyones talking about it
hes just rattling your cage
well i gotta tell you
with a wife three kids and a pension plan in the balance its rattling hard
we say nothing
it goes away
simple as that
will goes back to his suitcase
a thin film of sweat on his upper lip
lowers voice look
weve tampered with evidence
weve pushed witnesses
weve planted shit
and theyre sniffing around like dogs
especially on the dobbs case
will flares up
struck a nerve
turns to his partner
weston dobbs killed an eight year old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat
you remember that
you know i remember that
one word to i
and he walks
we could talk to buck
cut some kind of a deal
i heard thats what flynns doing
mike flynns a dirty cop hap
we are nothing like mike flynn
we did what we needed to do to make sure that son of bitch dobbs paid for what he did
and every bastard like him
we say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and theyll all walk
every last one
and i am not going to let that happen
he grabs a hanger
you grab on to something and you dont let it go
he takes out a handkerchief
wipes his brow
i dont know if its because you think its the right thing to do or because your pride wont let you do anything else
i cant tell any more
steps back but i can tell you one thing
im getting too old for this cowboy cop stuff
breaking the rules
cleaning up messes
were a dying breed will
youre a dying breed
all those reporters they dont care what you did at leland street seven years ago
they dont care that youve made this your life
they dont care about getting the bad guy
will turns on his partner eyes burning
the partners lock eyes
years of working together
a thousand things unsaid
hap reaches for the door
hap contd theyre watching us will
like it or not
theyre watching us
kay connells folder open on his chest
its dark in his room quiet
suddenly the shade on his window quivers and snaps up flooding the room with light
wills eyes pop open
he rolls over to look at the clock
squinting he gets up and walks over to the window
we can see the rest of his scar
runs down deep across his sternum
he yanks the shade back down
it bucks then settles
satisfied will returns to bed
plumps the pillow pulls the blanket up around him
closes his eyes
the shade lurches halfway
then snaps back up
light pours in
wills eyes open
you got to be kidding me
will jogs along in a sonics sweatshirt a ring of sweat around his collar
he looks out over the harbor
fishing boats coming in with their early morning haul
he checks his watch
slows to a walk
looks up and sees
ellie burr standing on the front steps of the pioneer lodge
holds up some car keys
fred wants us to meet him at the connells
a hula girl swinging from the rear view mirror
will in the passenger seat
wearing a crisp suit
ellie hands him a take out bag
brought you a bear claw
just in case you were hungry
will takes the bag
ellie contd local delicacy
think ill pass
he puts the bag on the dash
looks out the window
nightmutes main street
a line of shops
undistinguished town hall
elementary school up on a hill
sign out front sign ups for midnight little league
will contd what kind of calls you get around here
small time stuff
nothing like what you must get
mostly drinking related problems
stuff like that
she shifts down
takes a steep turn
ellie contd in the summer months its pretty quiet
thats when theres work out on the boats
the rest of the year though
they pass a man walking along the road
gnarled walking stick
ellie calls out the window
ellie contd hey there joe
ellie contd thats joe willy
took his family hostage in november
that was the most exciting thing that happened last year
i wasnt there though
grinds gear chief barely lets me handle anything above a misdemeanor
will looks over at her
dont give misdemeanors a bad rap
but theyre so boring
all small stuff
its all about the small stuff
people give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case
its human nature
he looks over
ellies listening intently
will contd arent you going to write that down
ellie searching her pockets for something to write with
let me just
realises wills teasing her
a small ranch house
flowers piled up by the front door
left by well wishers
i havent tidied up since fred told me not to touch anything
connell a big woman with a thick grey braid down her back opens the door to her daughters room
looks at will
i dont believe in keeping a childs room like a shrine
will heads into the room
a palpable uneasiness between them
fred and ellie stand in the doorway
connell turns to go
a small bedroom
pink shag carpeting and clouds painted on the ceiling
pictures cut from magazines pasted on the walls
a stack of tapes and a boom box in the corner
will stands in the middle of the room
taking it in
typical seventeen year old
beat she went to a party friday night
down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in
fred throws ellie a look
shes practically a kid herself
will opens the top drawer of the bureau
roots beneath the panties
on top of the bureau a stack of photos
a couple torn up
kay connell and a girl with white blonde hair
she left the party early
friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out
what time was that
around twelve thirty
hap picks up a bear on kays bed
a bell jingles when he shakes it
will crosses to a closet in the corner
who was the last one to see her alive
weve questioned him searched his place
didnt find anything
will pulls a dress out of the closet
small black elegant
the tags been cut out
he pulls out another then another
feels the fabric
these are designer
looks up could randy stetz afford these
fred and ellie exchange a look
he fixes boat engines
will looks around
cheap wallpaper torn window screens
well her mother didnt buy them for her
what are we thinking
will reaches over to a heart shaped box on the bedside table
pulls out a pretty gold necklace
holds it up
kay connell had an admirer
he hands the dresses to ellie
heads out of the room
will contd i want to talk to the boyfriend
close on a hand squeezing a shoulder
you dont seem all that sad
the shoulder jerks away
pull back to reveal randy stetz sitting at a wooden table in an interrogation room
longish blond hair wearing a metallica t shirt trying like hell to grow a moustache
i havent had a chance
you fuckers been all over my back since monday
he takes out a cigarette
he lights it
hap sits opposite
you know smoking stunts your growth
randy throws him a look
yeah okay fat ass
smiles at will more alaskan hospitality
will goes over to a coffee machine
pours a cup
did you love her
did you love her
randy flicks his ash
she was nice
will turns with his coffee
she was nice
that makes me all soft inside
ever occur to you she didnt love you back
you heard me that time
she loved me
she wanted to see me every night
but she was seeing someone else on the side
i dont know what youre fucking talking about
friday night at the party whatd you fight about
what kind of stuff
i dont fucking remember
the other guy
i told you i dont remember
after that she left the party to go to him
how should i know
ran like hell to go to him
fuck you man
im sick of all your fucking cop questions
will suddenly hurls his coffee cup and grabs randy up by the collar
nose to nose
now you listen to me you little shit
this fuck the world metallica t shirt crap may work with your mamma but it doesnt work with me
you got mad at your girlfriend because she was seeing someone else
you want to be the last person who saw her alive or are you going to tell me who that is
randys lip curls
i dont know
you dont know
she didnt tell me
disgusted will shoves randy back into his seat
will walking out of the interrogation room
ellie joins him
hes a little surly isnt he
will smooths back his hair
checks his tie
just a little
he reaches into his pocket and pulls out the gold necklace from kays room
hands it to her
i want you to check this out ellie
we already did
do it again
but there wasnt any
will puts a hand on her shoulder
the small things remember
the second youre about to dismiss something look at it again
ellie smiles teasing
you want me to write that down
will has to smile
looks down the hall
a bearded guy on crutches
ellie follows his gaze
the bartender at darrows
he was there friday night
hes up next
will heads over to him
ellie watches his neck
her hand closing over the necklace
the pioneer lodge restaurant
small dark wood a radio playing something between bluegrass and folk
some rough looking guys at the bar
throwing looks over at
will and hap sitting at a table
studying faded menus
reading halibut calabrese
halibut cajun style
halibut fish and chips
he puts down his menu
reaches for his drink
will contd cant wait to see whats for dessert
at least theres variety
will drains his drink
locks eyes with a big guy over at the bar
beer froth on his moustache
looks like the natives are restless
will looks back at his partner
haps fidgeting with the end of his tie
hap contd i think i think im gonna talk to buck when we get back to seattle
a cold flash down wills spine
i wish i could stick it out like you
i just with trish and the kids
dont do this hap
hap avoids his eyes
im thinking i could get off with probation
keep half my pension
thats all i want
hisses goddammit hap
think about what youre doing
you dont have to be involved will
you tell buck and im involved whether i like it or not
ready to order
the men look up interrupted
rachel is standing by the table with a pad
hap tries to recover with a big smile
hey you do everything around here
will stands abruptly
eyes on hap
trying not to explode
ill just have another scotch in my room
turns to rachel if you dont mind
just then his cell phone rings
will bursts into the bullpen
where is it
ellie fred and a couple other guys huddled around a desk
will and hap head over to them
one of the younger guys farrell intimidated by wills presence
tucks his shirt into his dirty jeans
they part to reveal a blue knapsack laying on the desk
mud spots all over it
an embroidered daisy
will examines it
were sure its hers
has her books in it
what about prints
ellie shakes her head unfortunately not
will reaches into the bag
pulls out two text books
biology and algebra
he shoves the books towards one of the guys
will contd find out who she studied with
he continues through the bag
pulls out a little plastic bag with hello kittys all over it
dumps out the contents
will contd make up
looks up at fred
will contd find out where she bought it
fred looks at him
not happy with make up duty
will pulls out a hair brush
hands it to ellie
will contd lab

will contd reading titles otherwise engaged murder at sunset
he looks up at the group
will contd who here reads this kind of crap
i read that kind of crap
will tosses them to him
tell me anything that strikes you
down to the bottom of the bag
a ziploc with a half eaten sandwich and an apple core
will hands them to ellie
will contd lab
upends the knapsack
scraps paper clips gum wrappers
will contd thats it
fred reaches for the knapsack
ill stick it in the evidence locker
will takes it walks slowly over to the window
twists the knapsack in his hands and looks out at the totem pole standing tall outside
a black raven alights on top of it
pecks at the air
seems to look right at will
will contd we put it back where we found it
will turns to them
will contd you said it was a fishing cabin
about two miles outside of town
on the beach
fred tightens his jaw
why are we taking it back
will ignores the question
walks back towards them
this murder was in the papers right
call all of them from here to anchorage
tell them we now know that kay connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack but we havent recovered it yet
checks watch we can get it in by the morning editions
he hands the bag to farrell
will contd fill this with random books
make it look heavy
will pulls out a handkerchief
wipes the mud off his hands
taking his time
finally turns to fred
will contd itll eat this guy alive if he thinks he overlooked a detail
pov through binoculars a wooden cabin comes into focus
right by the water
hasnt been used in years
weathered slate roof
algae growing up the sides
lighter than i remembered
will lowers his binoculars
hes standing on the black rocky beach
its damp slick and cold
a fogs rolling in
hap and farrell are sitting behind a cluster of rocks
a couple paper bags and a megaphone
theyre comparing guns
all plastic save the barrel and firing pin
what do you carry down in seattle
hap reaches into his holster
pulls out a
smith and wesson
fred duggars standing on the other side of them
hes got a pair of binoculars too
theyre staking out the cabin
been there a while
brought some coffee
ellie appears with a thermos
fred turns annoyed
what are you doing here
answering for her i told her to come
fred shoots will a look
down at his cowboy boots
will gives him a smile
fred goes back to scanning pissed
maybe this guy doesnt read the papers
or goes straight to the sports section
hap and farrell chuckle
hap unscrews the thermos
a cloud of steam
hap contd who gets first dibs
looks up at will will
will looks down at his partner
holding out the thermos like a weird kind of truce
will turns away rejecting it
a swath of thick fog unfolds over the black rocks as
looking through binoculars i see someone
hap and farrell scramble to their feet
will whips up his binoculars
pov through wills binoculars a figure making its way to the cabin
will lowers the binoculars
snaps his fingers at the men
will contd fan out
fred farrell and hap
start spreading out
ellie steps up
will looks back at her
will contd stay here ellie
will puts up his hand
she stops short
he plunges ahead
keeping eye contact
will points to farrell
wants the megaphone
farrell balancing on a rock holds it out
accidentally keys it
the feedback squawks
pov through wills binoculars the figure looking around running towards the cabin
leaping from rock to rock
will reaches for his smith and wesson
the men jump into action
race down towards the cabin
fred and farrell nimble over the wet rocks
will and hap harder going
grab onto jagged edges slip down small crevices
rocks sticking out every which way
the fog thick and white
the figure disappears into the cabin
fred and farrell leap up onto a tall boulder and jump down
run over to the door of the cabin guns at the ready
will rounds the boulder hap panting behind him
joins fred and farrell at the door
will levels his smith and wesson at the door and with a nod to fred as he kicks it in
the door cracks and swings in
the men rush inside
they look around nothing
a few old nets a wooden table rotted through
in the corner a trap door left open
will races over
looks down into the darkness
will contd goddammit
turns and points to farrell
will contd you
head back up to base
to fred you
go right and follow along the water
to hap hap
you go left
the men nod
will contd go
they rush out the door and split directions
will crouches down by the trap door and
drops down into a dark dank tunnel
will cocks his head
left or right
starts sprinting down towards the lighter end of the tunnel his own footsteps bouncing against the tunnel walls
he rounds a curve
he exits the tunnel onto the rocky beach
has enveloped everything obscuring all vision dulling all sound
like a strange dream
will blinks against the thick whiteness
strains to hear any sound anything
theres only the distant lapping of the water
he tightens his grip on his gun and plunges into the fog
quick careful steps
stumbles over a rock
waves his gun in defense
eyes wide open like a blind man
off to the right
will whips his head around
ellie alone jumps at the sound
reaches for her weapon
will heads towards the sound
reaching out for approaching rocks
scrambles over a small bank and finds
farrell rolled up into a fetal position on the ground
clutching his thigh
blood seeping through his fingers
he looks up
where is he
farrell cant answer that
will contd impatient whered the shot come from
farrell lifts his bloody hand
points off towards the water
will disappears back into the fog leaving farrell behind
clambers back down towards the water pausing every few seconds to listen to adjust
like an animal tracking its prey
leaps up onto a plateau of rocks when
a dark figure flashes past him
will wheels around
squeezes off a shot
cant believe it
goes for another
the figure disappearing
will tosses his smith and wesson reaches behind his back and whips out his smith
ellie weapon drawn making her way down the rocks
a hand suddenly grabs her arm
fred emerges from the fog
fred contd put that thing away
as another shot rips through the air
fred and ellie freeze
fred and ellie skittering down the rocks
getting closer to the water
hear a voice ring out
the fog starts to dissipate
they reach the water to see
kneeling beside the body of his partner
lying in the water
shot in the stomach
blood dribbling from his mouth
will grabs him up by the collar
starts shaking the limp body
will contd hap
haps head rolls back
will rips off his tie
presses it to the gaping wound
trying to stop the bleeding
warm blood pumping into the water
fred races over to the body
feels for haps pulse
will shaking hap again
veins popping up along his temples
fred catches his shoulder
fred contd dormer
will looks up at fred
his face contorts
suddenly leaps to his feet
grabs a rock and hurls it savagely into the thick fog
chief nyback sits in his chair
a somber expression on his face
and then you lost him
will sits opposite him
wet dishevelled dirty
haps blood smeared all over his shirt
staring off into space
and then i lost him
in the fog
about how long til you heard the suspects second shot
twenty thirty seconds
i followed the sound down to the water
will contd thats where i found hap
nyback sighs shakes his head
reaches down to his bottom drawer and pulls out a bottle of bourbon and a glass
i think you need a glass of this
he goes to unscrew the bottle but will shakes his head
rakes his hand through his hair
turns suddenly and swipes his arm across nybacks desk
everything crashes to the floor
yells why didnt i know about that goddamn tunnel charlie
nyback looks up at him
theres a bunch of those tunnels out there will
from bunkers over sixty years old
i dont even know half of them myself and i grew up here
will clenches his fists
i had him charlie
right in front of me
not two feet
i could smell the son of a bitch
playing with me
and i missed the shot
he was right there and i missed the shot
then my goddamned gun jammed
nyback gets up
limps over to his old friend
will you cant blame yourself
i had him
its only gonna make you crazy
just then theres a soft knock on the door
the men look over
ellie sticks her head in
speaks in a tone that belies that a man has recently died
you wanted to see me
will turns his back to her
nyback heads over
ellie flicks a look at the pile on the floor
at wills back
chief nyback contd i want you to take care of the investigation into detective eckharts shooting
ellie looks at him
lowers her voice
but what about the connell case
im on the connell case
nyback puts a hand on her shoulder
we need paperwork ellie
you know that
just write up a quick report
ellies shoulders droop
thought she was playing with the big boys
just then will turns abruptly and grabs his coat
im going to check on the roadblocks
nyback catches his arm
youre no good right now will
go back to the lodge
try to get some rest
will looks at him
knows hes right
close on a squealing tire ripping around a curve
scenery whipping past the window
his hands tight around the steering wheel
the hula girl dancing beneath the rear view mirror a smile plastered to her face
he grows suddenly pale
pulls the cherokee off to the side
will jumps out of the cherokee leaving the door open
runs down an alley behind a row of shops
a couple industrial trash bins
will leans his hand against the wall and vomits
hovers for a moment saliva dripping from his mouth
hears a buzzing behind him
a dead dog lying next to a dumpster
flies buzzing around its head
eyes wide open
like its watching him
will walks up to reception
no one there
just wants his key
rings the bell
in the back room he hears a radio
earlier this evening after an aborted attempt to apprehend a suspect
he was forty five
it clicks off abruptly
rachel appears in the doorway
takes in the blood on wills shirt
im sorry about your partner
will looks at her
she walks over to the desk
rachel contd its been on the radio for the last two hours
nothing but that
like when they found kay connells body
sympathetic smile were not used to this sort of thing up here
she reaches for his key
rachel contd he was standing right there just a couple of days ago
exactly where you are now
beat i hope i was nice to him
will takes his key
you were nice to him
he liked you
he smiles faintly turns to go
just then the phone rings
answering pioneer lodge
listens hold on a second
hes right here
rachel holds up the phone
covering the mouthpiece
rachel contd john warfield
hes called a couple of times
wills stomach drops
thats the last phone call in the world he wants to take
rachel reads his face
rachel contd want me to lie
will shakes his head
steps back and takes the phone
clears his throat
into phone dormer
a bemused voice on the other end
ive been trying to reach you
i was very sorry to hear about your partner detective eckhart
it must have been a terrible shock what happened this morning
not giving this asshole an inch
rachel trying not to listen
into phone thats not exactly how id put it
warfields voice contd no no
i suppose not
but i look forward to reading the report
into phone what do you mean funny
just that i felt detective eckhart and i hap and i were starting to make a real connection before you left
i sensed that he was ready to get some things off his chest
did you sense anything like that detective
i mean as his partner
will squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist
warfields voice contd you were his partner for what about ten years
will turns from rachel
into phone you know why everyone hates you warfield
its not your questions its not your press conferences its not even your cheap suits everyone hates you cause day after day you suck the marrow out of real cops
when you never had the balls to become one yourself
well i got to tell you its a shame youre not up here with me because id love to show you right now just what a real cop is capable
you just remember that when youre sitting at your bullshit desk reading your bullshit report on my dead partner
he hangs up the phone
runs his hand through his hair
turns back to rachel
will contd next time
go ahead and lie
were running through it
clambering over rocks
hearing the sound of our own breathing
our own heartbeat
an animal tracking its prey
suddenly a dark figure flashes past
just inches away
playing with us
we whip round with our weapon and
will bolts upright in bed
a film of sweat over his body
the sound that woke him the window shade flapping open
light floods the room
will gets up
goes over to the shade and pulls it down
it lurches up halfway
he tugs it down again
it slaps all the way open
will yanks it down so hard it rips off the window
he gets tangled in it
will contd goddamned
pulls it off and flings it in the corner
the digital clock flips to a new minute
scratching at his stubble
unable to sleep
keeps stepping on a squeaky floorboard
slows near the adjoining door that leads into haps room
lightly pushes the door open
the pictures on the bedside table
a woman and three teenage girls
water gushing out of the faucet
wills watch sitting on the sinks edge
will reaches up into the open medicine cabinet for a bottle of aspirin
shakes out a couple
cups his hand under the water and knocks the pills back
closes the medicine cabinet and cries out
looming behind him
theyre watching us will
will whirls around
no ones there
close on running shoes pounding the tarmac
pull back to reveal will running down nightmutes main street
a couple native alaskans walking into a hardware store
stop talking and glance over at him
a young mother in her husbands work shirt
lifts her small kids into the cab of a x
watches him pass
an older man fixing the broken e on his store front
turns at the sound of wills footfall
a murderer amongst them
will continues on
looking straight ahead
wipes the sweat from his neck
slows to a stop just outside the
a blown up picture of kay connell in the window
below a painted sign we miss you kay
a stack of newspapers by the front door
the nightmute ledger
the headline seattle cop killed by suspect
will picks one up
stares down at it
rain starts to dot the paper
were going to bring down a couple of guys from ridgemount but i want us to step up the investigation here
rain hammering against the windows
chief nyback addresses the bullpen
everyones there except farrell
nightmute hasnt lost an officer in thirty seven years and even though detective eckhart wasnt from here he was as good as one of us on this case
i had the honor of working with him down in seattle for a number of years
he was a fine detective and an even better man
will stands nearby watching the rain hit the windows
his suit pants are slightly wrinkled
nyback nods towards fred
chief nyback contd fred youll be working with detective dormer directly from now on
fred stroking his moustache nods
nyback turns to will
chief nyback contd will
anything youd like to add
will looks up
everyones eyes turn to him
he shakes his head
then lets get to it
chairs scraping the floor as people get up
a sense of determination in the air
will grabs his coat
ellie is beside him holding a map
ellie contd im sorry to bother you but i was asked to write the report on
lowers eyes you know what i was asked to write the report on
looks back up could you just to be accurate for the report could you just point out where you were when you saw detective eckhart yesterday
she holds out the map
its of the small stretch of coastline
red circles marking various points
will looks down at her
takes the map
turns it around
its good to be accurate ellie
youre doing your job
he looks down at the map
ellie watching his face
im so sorry about what happened
i know you did everything you could
will points to a spot
cutting her off
i was here
hands her back the map
just then fred walks up
still no sign of the bullet that went through farrell
im going to the hospital to talk to him now
looks at his watch you get the search party together
no fewer than thirty people
ill meet you in exactly twenty five minutes
dont waste any time
he pulls on his coat and heads for the door
fred watches him leave
sticks a toothpick in his mouth
partner or no partner
that guys a prick
he has to be a prick fred
hes a great detective
close on the cover of one of the paperbacks otherwise engaged by walter byrd
pull back to reveal farrell lying in a hospital bed in striped pajamas reading it
a tear runs down his cheek as he turns the page
a snickers bar is tossed onto his lap
he looks up
will stands by his bed
farrell puts down the book
picks up the snickers
farrell contd you dont seem like the bring an underling whos in the hospital a snickers bar kind of guy
he pulls up a chair
nods to the paperback
will contd hows the book
farrell bites into the candy bar
oh a real tear jerker
brody the good guy just got shot
he stops chewing
realises the association
farrell contd oh
i wish id had the chance to get to know him better
take him fishing or something
he would have liked that
we just gotta catch the bastard right
thats why im here
i need to know exactly what you saw yesterday farrell
what i saw
farrell takes another bite of the snickers
like a little boy
furrows his brow trying to remember
pretty much nothing
that fog was so thick
the bullet seemed to come out of nowhere
i dont even remember seeing any shapes
then i saw you
but only when you came up close
then you disappeared again
shrugs i guess i heard more than i saw
will sighs rubs his eyes
farrell contd sorry
dont be sorry
its not your fault
just then a nurse comes in with a dixie cup
pretty freckled face
not much older than kay connell
time for your meds
farrell smiles at her winks at will
lonnie and i went to high school together
lonnie gives him the cup
just take the pills farrell
hows the leg
oh you know
dont feel that much
bullet went right through
got lost in the rocks
well get the other one though
will looks up
farrell pops the rest of the snickers in his mouth
farrell contd after the autopsy
will walks down the hallway
light pouring in from a set of high windows
he looks tired
pov of someone watching him
from a doorway
not close not far
a hand comes into view
holds on to the door jamb
will suddenly stops
skin prickling at the back of his neck
turns and looks around
a man in a wheelchair
a little girl tugging at her hospital gown
a couple of nurses laughing at check in
an empty doorway
back at the beach
we see nothing but fog
a voice comes through
and it was at this point that detective dormer headed towards the noise
ellie emerges from the fog
carrying the map and talking into a small tape recorder
shes climbing over the rocks wearing a windbreaker a couple sizes too big
a uniformed officer follows carrying a camera
she turns to him
ellie contd remember kepp shoot everything
back to the tape recorder wherein he discovered the wounded detective farrell brooks having been shot in the vastus externus of the upper left thigh
she climbs over the same bank will dormer climbed two evenings before
another uniformed officer hanging out and smoking
ellie contd francis
he looks up
pimples on his chin
youre supposed to be farrell
shot in the thigh and writhing in pain
whats it matter
points to the ground now get down
francis looks up at her
flicks his cigarette away and gets down amongst the rocks
holds his thigh like he was shot
kepp takes the picture
ellie sloshes through the water
ankles getting cold
but it doesnt matter
into tape recorder shortly after hearing the second shot detective dormer continued through the water until he spotted the body lying approximately fifteen feet away
looks at the map
at the spot will pointed out
looks back up
clicks off the recorder
ellie contd you there rich
a voice calls back
someone pretending to be hap
and im freezing my nads off
ellie furrows her brow
slips on a rock but catches his fall
think i found something
close on a row of feet
some more beat up than others
inching forward along a road
anything catches your eye you put it in a bag
anything looks strange you put it in a bag
pull back to reveal a long line of people stretched out across the road about a mile up the beach
some old some young
linking arms and moving forward
the will walking up and down behind the line
talking through a megaphone
will contd anything he may have dropped moved kicked or stepped on you put in a bag
cigarette butts gum wrappers paper clips coins buttons nine times out of ten a suspect leaves something behind
a couple burly guys with some bloodhounds
where do you want us
will points over to the woods on the other side of the road
one group heading south the other heading north
nods to fred whos standing nearby
he hands the guys two radios
make sure theyre set to channel
just then two young officers pull up in a squad car
young and apple cheeked
the first one holding a piece of paper
we did the interviews with all the nearby houses like you asked
shakes his head heres a list of who we talked to
hands the list to will
he glances it
go back and set up some follow ups for this afternoon
the officers nod put the car in reverse
fred saunters over
nods towards the searchers
you dont think they should start further back
will shakes his head
he had to have exited here
over those boulders
i saw him move hes nimble
would have taken the hardest way out
fred shrugs skeptical
just then his cell phone bleats
he reaches for it
into phone duggar
will looks back at the search team
fred contd into phone where was it
a local woman
at the end of the line
glances over her shoulder
looks at will
youll help us catch him
fred contd into phone okay
slaps phone closed that was ellie
will turns back to him
fred contd they found farrells bullet
says it looks like a
after the autopsy rich can drive em both to the lab in anchorage

fred crosses his arms
fred contd that is if its alright with you
rachel winding an old grandfather clock with a key
looks about a hundred years old
will enters the lobby
carrying an armload of wet files
rachel turns sees him
reaches over to an umbrella stand
hands him an umbrella
its on the house
will takes it
he starts up the stairs
notices rachel straining to return the key to the top of the clock
backtracks to help her
she gets it without his help
i got it
smiles dont know why i bother
its been broken for two years
rachel looks at him
cant figure this guy out
rachel contd oh
a man came by to see you earlier
said he was your new partner
a tingle skips down wills spine
he looks at her
he didnt say what his name was
only that you were expecting him
im not expecting anyone
thats not what he thinks
what did he look like
rachel thinks for a second
leaning against the clock
not that memorable
will nods rubs his forehead
suddenly has a pounding headache
turns for the stairs
i need to borrow something
close on a nail
one thwack of a hammer and it bites into the wall
pull back to reveal will nailing the corner of a blanket to one side of the window
an ad hoc curtain
he finishes that side
starts to stretch the blanket across the window
to the left
to the right
to see if anybodys out there
if anybodys watching
a lone tugboat chugging across the harbor
pulling a huge freighter
will squeezes his eyes shut
opens them again
pulls the blanket fully across the window
the files spread across the floor
their edges buckled from the rain
dozens of pictures of kay connell
back and forth
over that same squeaky floorboard
the clock reads
will lying in bed
on top of the blanket
staring at the adjoining door
into haps room
will in a sweatshirt and coat heads down the front steps of the pioneer lodge
jams his hands in his pockets
the walk of an insomniac
will walking down main street
in the middle of the road
the dead of night
the sky a blinding white
hears some rowdy noise coming from a corner bar beer lights flickering
a woman rides by on a bicycle
stuck somewhere in between
like a dream
turns down a side street
passing more stores
guns and ammo
pattys hair and nails
comes upon where he vomited the day before
sees the dead dog still down at the end
half obscured by the dumpster
will wavers pale
a homeless man emerges from the shadows
awakened from his sleep
will quickly backtracks to the sidewalk
just then the crack
of bat hitting ball
in the distance
nightmute elementary school
a little league game in full swing
the uniforms a little faded
the diamond a little unkempt
a smattering of spectators
mostly dads with six packs
will wanders over to the fence
spots ellie sitting alone on the bottom bleacher
the sounds of the game delayed a few seconds
watches as will crosses to the bleachers
and sits down next to ellie
she turns surprised
ellie contd detective dormer
what are you doing here
looks at watch its two thirty in the morning
shouldnt you be asleep
will glances out at the game
i could say the same thing about you
we always have play offs in the middle of the night
its the best time
the puffins and the hawks
were in extra innings
the hawks have a really good line up this year
she sips on a take out coke
looks back at the game
a plump redheaded girl comes up to bat
blows a bubble
thats my sister
will looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss by a mile
ellie cups her hands around her mouth
ellie contd calling out thats okay lib
to will usually shes better
she your only sibling
nods twelve years younger
libby takes another swing
connects with the ball
drops the bat and runs to first
ellie gives a sharp whistle
ellie contd what about you
you have any siblings
rubs his eyes well
i had a brother
he died when i was eleven
ellie sits up
oh i shouldnt have
happened a long time ago
he was killed in a fire
in new mexico
that must have been awful for you
will leans back
stretching his legs
slight smile i remember i was more embarrassed that he had died
embarrassed that it made me different
so i didnt tell the other kids at school what had happened
theyd ask me where he was where hed gone
and id make up stories
he was visiting an aunt up north hed broken his leg he was in a swiss boarding school
stuff like that
shakes his head nice kid huh
just kept making up more and more lies
suddenly he stops talking
slowly sits up
ellie noticing the shift
the row of dads behind them
jump up and start cheering
sees him sit up
that same prickle at the back of his neck
a kid slides home just as
trying to shake the feeling
im going back to the lodge ellie
still need to go through some of kay connells school records
he turns to go scanning the area
ellie calls after him
ellie contd try to get some sleep
the nightmute morgue
a squad car pulls up
francis gets out whistling
starts for the morgues entrance
will in the cherokee
dark circles under his eyes
suit jacket wrinkled
pulls in next to francis squad car
calls out window officer
ill pick it up
you head back to the station
will walking down a hallway
on his cell phone
into phone duggar im at the coroners now
ill be back in about twenty minutes
stops at an open doorway in time to see the coroner pull a sheet over the cold blue body of hap eckhart
wills heart lurches
he grabs on to the door jamb
wasnt ready for that
the coroner looks up
thought you were sending one of your lackeys
will clears his throat
closes his cell phone
i thought it was better if i came
under the circumstances
the coroner nods
goes to wash her hands
its different when you know them isnt it
nods to clipboard just sign over there and shes all yours
shrugs off her lab coat
shes wearing a blue dress
looks like a piano teacher
heads into an adjoining office
steps into the room
the smell of formaldehyde
bloody instruments on a stainless steel tray
walks towards the clipboard eyes flicking over to the shape under the sheet when
suddenly haps hand drops down
your partner didnt suffer much
the coroner re emerges from the office with a manila envelope
hap eckhart written on it in black pen
coroner contd maybe for a minute or two
will rubs his face
tries to focus on the clipboard
the coroner holds out the envelope
coroner contd just enough time to reflect
he takes the envelope
the coroner peers up at him
youre looking a little green detective
fred duggar dialing the phone at his cluttered desk
so wheres the other bullets
he looks up
will standing before him holding the manila envelope
close on a key slipping into a padlock
opens with a click
pull back to reveal fred and will in a small storage room
standing in front of an army green locker
the evidence locker
rooms stuffed with old files and boxes
moose antlers hanging over a small window
will glances up
whats with all the moose antlers around here
fred throws a look over his shoulder
opens the locker
lots of moose
inside the locker another manila envelope
the name on this one farrell brooks
fred reaches back for the other envelope
will hesitant to give it to him
feeling the bump of the bullet in the bottom corner
hands it over
wipes his brow
whens rich coming
fred slides it in beside farrells
closes the locker door
ill call him now
first i need a copy of the key
fred turns a twinkle in his eye
this isnt seattle detective
we dont have copies
holds up key this is the only one
will looks at him
at the key
plucks it from his hand
just then nybacks secretary appears in the doorway
the secretary hands will the phone
pulls something from under the desk
a beat up box
wills name on it
this came for you earlier
will glances at it
takes the phone
rubs his eyes
into phone dormer
someones there but theyre not saying anything
will too tired for this shit
will contd goddammit warfield if youre gonna check up on me every
a mans voice
not john warfields
this voice is medium ranged
nose sounds stuffed
i bet you havent been getting much sleep
into phone what
a little titter on the other end
you lower s
you think the white nights are kind of neat
then you cant sleep for days
ive seen it happen about a million times
but you cant sleep for a different reason
into phone who is this
will loosens his tie
into phone i said who is this
dropping to a whisper
i saw what really happened will
will furrows his brow
i saw you kill your partner
with your back up weapon
out there on the beach
i saw you shoot him dead
will dormers face
as all the blood drains from it
as all sound fades around him
as his heart begins to pound against his chest
he falters reaching out for the desk
to steady himself
as if the floors just dropped out beneath him
eyes darting around the bullpen
sotto into phone now you listen to me
i wont tell anyone
oh and i saw you take my gun
my uncles old
i dropped it in the rocks
but you can go ahead and keep that
chief nyback exits his office
looks at will and smiles
mans voice contd i mean
beat now that were partners
the line goes dead
will throat constricted
listening to the dial tone
smiles back at nyback
slowly hangs up the phone
white as a sheet
trying to act normal
trying to act calm
sound returning to the bullpen like nothings different
looks over at sitting on the edge of the secretarys desk
he reaches for it
carefully rips the packing tape
bends back a flap
inside some dark blue material
an embroidered daisy
kay connells knapsack
will heading for the cherokee
clutching the box
face pale pace quick
everythings different now
he closes his eyes
now is not the time
reaches the cherokee
yanks open the drivers side door
ellie catches up with him
out of breath
you look like youre in a hurry
i just wanted to ask you about these pictures
she smiles holds up some photographs
theyre of the beach
the ones kepp took
almost all fog
ellie contd i know theyre not great quality but this is where you said you were when you first saw detective eckhart right
barely glancing at them
tosses the box into the car
gets in and closes the door
puts his hand over the box
ellie comes up to the window
but heres the thing
i retraced your exact steps according to your statement
you couldnt have seen detective eckhart from there
i mean not in that fog
then change it
how much closer would you say you were
i dont remember
will about to seriously lose his shit
looks at ellie
eyes dark distant
i dont have time for this shit
five feet seven feet twenty feet
put down whatever you want in your report alright
he turns the ignition
pulls out with a squeal
ellie steps back watching him drive away
more curious than stung
parked off road
a remote spot by the water
the drivers side door left open
the ping ping ping of the interior bell
will dormer walking along a breakfront
one foot in front of the other
staring out at nothing
the endless sea
closing in on him
he stumbles over a rock
grabs his head in his hands
he saw it
he saw it
a wave explodes nearby
drenching him in sea spray
will turns raking his hand across his face
trying to focus
trying to think this through
hears a dog barking in the distance
shakes his head
looks at his watch
got to deal with the problem at hand
will bursts into his room at the lodge
the shoulders of his coat still wet with sea spray
crosses to the area of the floor where kay connells files are still spread out
starts pressing the floorboards with the toe of his boot
he finds the one that squeaks
gets down on his knees
then jams his fingers in around the loose board
starts pulling it up
slips his hand into the gap
pulls out a muddy ruger
the killers gun
will stares down at it
will standing at the mouth of the alley
just like the night before
peering into the shadows for the homeless man
heads for the dumpster at the end of the alley
shoves it aside
looks down at
the dead dog
holds a handkerchief to his face
waving away the flies
pulls the ruger from his pocket
shrugs his coat off and wraps it around his hand and the gun
fires a muffled shot into the dogs side
the body kicks
feels along the dogs ribs for the bullets point of entry
pulls out a penknife and extends one of the blades
cuts into the gash fingers probing deep for the lodged bullet
he finds it
pulls it out
looks back at the dog
takes a deep breath
wipes his brow
a little smear of the dogs blood left on his forehead
turns and pulls a bottle of rubbing alcohol from his pocket
douses the bullet
glancing at his watch
running out of time
the rear of the nightmute pd building
will looking around heads briskly for the back door
steps into the hallway leading towards the bullpen
waiting for them to fade
heads down towards the storage room
glancing briefly at the pictures hanging on the wall
of old time police officers
striking brave poses
the storage room
the moose antlers looming over his shoulder
will pulls the evidence locker key from his pocket
unlocks the padlock
swings the door open
pulls the hap eckhart envelope out
throwing a look over his shoulder
shakes out the bullet that was lodged in haps spine
then fishes a plastic bag from his pocket
the bullet he shot into the dead dog
drops that into the envelope and reseals it
catches the corner of his eye
his reflection in the locker mirror
the blood smear still on his forehead
quickly wipes the smear off and turns
fred duggar standing behind him
rich by his side
will clears his throat shoves haps envelope into freds hand
these should have gone out two hours ago
slams the locker door and brushes past him
fred and rich exchange a glance
close on a young girls face
dark hair held up in two barrettes wind tousling the curls
reading from a piece of paper
and thats how i think kay would want us to remember her
pull back to reveal kay connells funeral
people standing by the grave most of them high schoolers
the skys a brilliant blue
red fireweeds blanket the hillside
young girl contd swimming reading hiking through the kebaughs
stand off to the side
dressed in black
fred looks like hes never worn a tie before
ellie holds a potted plant
a gift for the bereaved
young girl contd playing her flute meeting at darrows after school
not really listening
not really paying attention
a thousand miles away
tugs at his collar
and always always with a smile on her face
the young girl looks up
folds the paper closed
connell reaches out to squeeze her arm
start circulating with plastic buckets
filled with white carnations
handing them out
will startled looks down
a little girl stands before him
holding up a bucket
he shakes his head
looks back up at the mourners lining up to place the carnations on kays casket
an old man with a brass tipped cane
two girls look like sisters holding each other up
a man with a thick red beard
a little boy about five clutching a flute tied with a pink ribbon
will looks away
at the end of the line
something catches his eye
in tight jeans and a down vest
in front of him stands a girl with white blonde hair
from the torn pictures in kay connells room
will straightens at the sight of her
sees randy surreptitiously caress her ass
the service is over
people are heading back to their cars
fred yanks off his tie
looks at ellie
we should go say hello to mrs
he starts off
ellie looks back at will
you go ahead
ill be there in a second
catches up to fred
will turns his attention back to randy and the girl
over at the far end of the cemetery
standing next to randys motorcycle
randy gets on his bike strapping his helmet on
the girls about to get on behind him
why dont i give her a ride
they look over
will walking towards them
the wind whipping his jacket
randy makes a face
thought i smelled something
good to see you too randy
will arrives at the bike
the girl tanya francke looks at him curiously
her long white blonde hair her skin almost translucent
something sexy about her
has the carnation stuck in the buttonhole of her jean jacket
fred shakes mrs
looks over and sees will standing with tanya and randy
shifts the plant in her hands
will shows the gold shield on his belt
randy kick starts the bike
he kicks it again
calls out over his shoulder
you coming or not
sunlight dappling through tall fir trees
tanya sitting next to him
her black skirt riding up
picking at the flaking polish on her nails
i never met anyone from seattle before
youre not missing much

you were good friends with kay connell werent you
pulls a cigarette from her purse
i was her best friend

her midriff showing
shifts her body towards will
tanya contd but theres no law against not crying right

tanya makes a face
reaches out and taps the hula girl

i dont want to talk about her right now
lets just drive
will looks over at her
she blows out a plume of smoke
you want me to take you somewhere
long as its fun
she reaches out a sinewy arm
starts massaging the back of wills neck
tanya contd young impressionable girl left alone with older seattle detective
who knows what we could get up to
will impervious to the touch
reaches for the gear
his foot pressing harder on the gas
the cherokee whips around a curve
likes the speed
will goes even faster
the cherokee breaks free from the forest
racing along a coastal road
water crashing against the rocks
up ahead a logging truck coming the other way
the cherokee shifts lanes
heading straight for the truck
tanya looks out at the truck
how about this
you like this
the truck beeps
will goes faster
tanya takes her hand from wills neck
holds on to her seat
the gaps closing fast
the truck beeps again
tanya looks over at will
not giggling any more
thought you wanted something fun
will goes even faster
the truck and the cherokee
on a collision course
the truck beeps wildly
tanya squirming in her seat
not liking this any more
will staring dead ahead
tensing his jaw
bearing down on them
tanya reaches for the wheel
will pushes her hands away
a breath away
tanya contd screaming move over you crazy fuck
the truck and the cherokee
just feet from each other
at the last moment
the cherokee jerks out of the way
screeches to a stop near an old sign icicle cannery
will gets out
slams his door
rounds the car and opens tanyas door
shes screaming at him
you crazy son of a bitch
you could have killed us
will reaches in and pulls her out of the car
tanya contd ow

will pulls her up a steep hill of garbage and broken crates
pushes her down the other side
tanya contd you want to tell me what the fuck this is all about
will stands above her on the hill
his face set like stone
you and kay were like sisters
thats what i said
told each other everything
heads down the hill that why your pictures torn up in the top drawer of her bureau
tanya steps back
will contd why her boyfriends hand was clamped on your ass at her funeral
he grabs her by the arm
jerks it up
she cries out
will leans in
will contd you like games little girl
well how about this one youre standing right where her naked body was found wrapped up in a garbage bag
tanyas eyes grow wide
she looks around her
a seagull pecking at the body of a dead bird
she tries to break away
who was kay seeing besides randy stetz
tanya looks away
will contd who gave her those dresses
she struggles more
wills grip is like a vice
will contd i need a name
i dont know
you dont know
she wouldnt tell me
but you were such good friends
it was like some big fucking secret
she kept saying she was gonna get out of here
leave us all behind
that he was going to take her
she used some stupid code name
what was it
i dont know
crying something brody
hes heard that name before
suddenly tanya jams her heel into his shoe
he cries out
she breaks away from him
runs up the hill
tears streaking her face
throws the carnation to the ground
tanya contd you happy now you fucking bastard
close on a finger
running along a row of book spines
pull back to reveal will in nightmutes small bookstore
still in his funeral clothes
in the mystery
not finding what he wants
then something catches his eye a bargain bin at the end of the aisle
will limps down to it
avoides eye contact with a young woman shelving new arrivals
reaches into the bin
rummages through some paperbacks
then he finds it otherwise engaged by walter byrd
underneath the title he finds what hes looking for another j
flips to the inside of the cover
a blurry picture of walter byrd
head turned to the side
walter byrd was born in watson lake canada
wills eyes skip down to the bottom mr
byrd currently lives in umkumiut alaska with his two labrador retrievers lucy and desi
will looks up
slaps the book closed
will drives sipping take out coffee
trying to fight the stinging in his eyes
passes a sign umkumiut miles
will stands in a phone booth at the gas station
flips through the phone book
his finger tracing down the b s
finds it walter byrd s
diamond tooth apt
skys become overcast
will stands across the street from a pale blue building
on the ground floor a tackle store
above looks like several apartment units
he starts across
will heads down a narrow hallway
passes door a
stops at the next one b
hears nothing but the muted tv from apartment a
pulls out his gloves
with a click the door swings open
will gloves on pockets his credit card
hears the ching ching of dog collars as two labrador retrievers stand at attention growling
takes a bag of treats from his pocket
the dogs break
trot over to him
wolf down the treats
will scans the place
matching sofa and easy chair corduroy upholstery
the walls lined with old s movie posters
all second rate detective movies another shot in the dark lady luck he wore a black hat
will walks across the room
the pathetic hovel of a killer
looks into the single bed
books and magazines
a half eaten tuna sandwich on the bedside table
nypd blue calendar on the wall
he walks over to a large desk by the window
mini cassette recorder
on the wall hundreds of newspaper articles
some yellowing some fresh
all about cops officer louis saved my life
shoot out in soho south street cop takes down drug ring seattle cop killed by suspect
will curls his lip
starts looking through the papers on the desk
underneath a stack he finds an x photograph
its of byrd standing in front of a big lakeside house
a radio tower in the background
walter byrds face is blurred turned to the side
the photo from the book bio
will takes it
starts roughly opening drawers
a box of animal crackers a rubber band ball
then shoved in the back of the top drawer an appointment book
will flips through to todays date
shoves the book into his pocket
slams the door closed
then reaches back for his smith
checks the magazine
slaps it back in place
suddenly the phone rings
a beige rotary on the desk
plugged into an ancient answering machine
it rings again
the answering machine whirs
now youre mad at me
walters voice contd i spotted your car around the corner
you must have been in a hurry
put some pieces together
dont worry i would have done the same thing
will turns back to the window
walters voice contd anyway
blows nose im not coming home
so you shouldnt wait there all day
i mean theyll wonder about you at the station
you should be careful about following procedure will especially now that
will lunges for the phone
snatches it up just as click
the tape cuts off
enraged he punches the receiver through the wall
will exits the apartment
cradling his hand
looks down at the tile floor
scanning it for a broken tile
bends down and plucks out a broken corner
places it carefully where the bottom of the door meets the door jamb
his beeper goes off
will strides into the bullpen
wounded hand in pocket
ellie hunts and pecks at a typewriter
fred over in the corner
slams a drawer in the filing cabinet
forget your pager
i beeped you over two hours ago
holds out a one page report
fred contd got a fax from the lab
murder weapon was a ruger
will takes the report
heads over to the coffee machine
and something else that might interest you
he reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a book
holds it up
fred contd remember this
one of the paperbacks we found in kay connells knapsack
will pours himself a cup of coffee
trying to keep the stream steady
ellie continues typing
connell found this copy in the house
opens it up its signed
this is a local writer
kay had all his books
i think we should check it out
will rubs his chin
looks back at the report
i dont think itll lead anywhere
the clacking stops
will turns around
ellies staring right at him that isnt like him
he turns back to fred
will contd well
if hes local
give him a call
the clacking resumes
a dark stairway
late at night
will bathed in shadows
climbs to the top
he heads down a hallway
we recognise it
back where walter byrd lives
will approaches apartment b
slowly pulls out his weapon
waits a beat then swings out in front of the door
ready to fight
ready to confront
tile corners still there
close on walter byrds appointment book laying open
scrawled in pencil
pull back to reveal will sitting in the parked cherokee
the appointment book on the passenger seat
been there all night
taking its toll
his hair no longer neatly combed
his face pale and unshaven
his eyes dragged open from fatigue
looks like the whole worlds pulling him down
staring down the street at a brick building on the corner
a placard by the front door dr
florence agee d
will checks his watch
rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands
something tells him to look up
in the distance walking along the road
hes in his forties
short shoulders sloped
wears a beige zip up windbreaker khakis brown desert boots
has a bulky hearing aid in one ear
is looking down at the road
byrd slows his pace
will reaches for the door handle
byrd turns in the other direction starts walking fast
will leaps out of the cherokee and heads after him
his short legs pumping spots a tour bus across the road
veers over to it
a runners stride
weaves through people
closing in on byrd
sees his plan
cuts across the road just as
rounds the corner
wills pitched up and over the hood
falls hard on the tarmac
dazed for a second
blood gushing from his forehead
hears the pick up door open
feet running over to him
are you alright
you popped out from nowhere
more feet running over
will opens his eyes
trying to focus
looks up and sees in the distance
walter byrd getting on the tour bus
will struggles to his feet
the old lady who hit him wearing overalls
i dont think you should move
will stands wavering
flashes her his badge
the old lady rips along in the truck
will sits in the passenger seat a handkerchief to his forehead
its soaked with blood
the lady looks over
you sure youre okay
careful not to bleed on my interior
will looks over at her
shifts in his seat
feels like a couple cracked ribs
peers out the windshield at the tour bus a few cars ahead of them
aerial view of the pick up tailing the tour bus
a windy coastal road
beyond it a blanket of endless evergreens
a ferry at the end of the pier
a small wooden booth for selling tickets
beautiful sweeping snow capped mountains on the other side of the bay
nothing else for miles around
the pick up pulls up next to the bus and a couple other cars
will jumps out
scans the area for byrd
then sees the last few people boarding the ferry
ferrys getting pitched around in the roiling water
most everyone is inside
tourists with throw away cameras backpacks anoraks children
some looking sea sick in the corner
will weaves through the crowd
eyes darting searching
the ferry lurches to one side the crowd sways will spots walter byrd standing by a window
walter holds on to the railing
looking at the view the sea spray
will comes up
stands next to him
cognizant of the people around them
walter continues looking out the window
that same stuffed nose voice
when i was seven my mother and grandmother took me to vancouver
we were walking along the street one day when these two men ran past and snatched my grandmothers purse right from under her arm
right from under her arm
that night a police officer came to our hotel room to ask us questions
stood the whole time
the ferry pitches again
will grabs on to the railing
looking down at this little man
hate in his eyes
walter contd his uniform looked brand new
his shoes and badge were polished his billy club his belt buckle
he was like a soldier but better
walter reaches up to blow his nose
wills eyes look on in disgust his knuckles are still red and swollen
from beating kay connell to death
walter contd made a huge impression on me
gave me an instant respect for the police
i tried to become a cop when i left high school but
he points to his hearing aid
walter contd congenital problem
the ferrys engine hums to a stop
walter contd oh
spilling down between two huge mountains
enormous in its whiteness its coldness its silent power
will and walter walk up its face away from the other tourists
walter leads the way
hands in his pockets
you know this glacier moves a quarter of an inch every day
he points off to the horizon
walter contd and on a clear day you can see all the way over to newtok
theres a beautiful aviary over there
we can go sometime
wills lip curls
walter contd its actually cool for this time of year
normally the temperature runs about
suddenly will lunges at him
walters eyes widen in surprise as he grabs him up by the collar
nose to nose
will barely keeping control
you think this is a nice meeting were having here
two people getting acquainted
jerks him harder you sick coward fuck
i get up every morning of my life just to bring someone like you down
beating a seventeen year old girl to death
washing her afterwards cleaning her
make you feel like a real man
tightens his grip huh
will contd i outta end this right now
take a rock and smash your fucking skull in
his jaws tense nostrils flare
walter red faced sputtering
i stood right behind you
i saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him
will clenches his teeth
walter contd seattles great hero
shooting his own partner
i saw it all
that was an accident
you hear me
i didnt know it was him
shakes him hard i didnt know it was him
just then a shriek
will looks over a couple kids
further down the glacier
having a snowball fight
will looks back at walter
has to take it easy
shoves him away in disgust
walter falls down onto the snow
dislodges his hearing aid
watches will pace
ribs screaming in pain
then why lie about it
walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid
puts it back around his ear
walter contd i mean im all for bending the truth
thats what i do in my novels
its my trade you might say
but why cover it up
brushes the snow from his butt
checks something in his pocket
walter contd you dont have to tell me if you dont want to
im sure you have some reason
i have faith in that
looks down at the kids
shakes his head
walter contd they should be bundled up better
whats your game byrd
walter turns back to him
the phone call
i figured were partners on this one
i mean after what i saw
will stops short
its all he can do not to throttle this weed
lets get one thing straight byrd
we are partners on nothing
walter looks at him
scratches his head
i research my novels
i know the procedures
youd have cuffed me back at the ferry
youd have called for back up read me my rights and gotten a search warrant for my apartment
youre a well respected detective
theres no reason for you to be talking to me right now
he takes out a handkerchief
blows his nose
walter contd except that we could help each other
will stares at him
walter contd so
were at an impasse
will runs his hands through his hair
turns to watch
the kids down the glacier
making angels in the snow
their giggles carried along by the wind
will squeezes his eyes shut
about to defy every instinct in his body
sotto youre going to get a phone call
walter steps up tapping his hearing aid
i said youre going to get a phone call
perks up oh
kay connell had a signed copy of one of your books
thought you might find that
youre going to be brought in for questioning
down at the station
hisses yes down at the station
walter rubs his hands together
brought in for questioning
i can write this
just then the ferry blows its horn
low and loud
walter looks down at it
walter contd ferrys leaving
he starts down
will watches him pass has no choice but to follow
walter going over the details in his head
walter contd something to divert
snaps his fingers
walter contd my gun
you still have my gun right
spreads out his hands
walter contd then thats the wild card
every detective story has a wild card
what do you mean wild card
boarding the ferry
next ferrys in forty five minutes
walter heads over to the ramp
will stops grabbing his side
a pang through his ribs
calls out to walter
what do you mean wild card
walter looks back
at the questioning
gives his ticket to the ticket taker
walks back to the stern
looks out at will
the horn sounds again
walter at the rail
the ferrys engine churning up water
starting forward just as
walter takes a mini cassette recorder from his pocket
holds it up for will to see
will on shore sees it
a cold flash ripping through his body
bolts through some tourists towards the ramp but
a couple of guys are just pulling it in
the ticket taker grabs his arm
to will full up
will jerks his arm away
stares off at the ferry
walter byrd and his tape recorder
receding into the distance
close on a counter top
stuff thrown down
first aid cream
bottle of scotch
pull back to reveal will standing at the counter in the convenience store
his entire body aching
the cashier throws him a look
i have a cold
will exits the store
a bag under his arm
we miss you kay looming over his shoulder
steps out onto the sidewalk and sees
ellie leaning against her truck
waiting for him
which way are you walking
a tingle all across wills body
this girls everywhere
he hunches into his coat
flicks up his collar
doesnt want her to see him fully
nods down the road
back to the lodge
ellie grabs her bag
they start walking
i needed to get your signature on something
she pulls a folder from her bag
ellie contd the report on detective eckhart
chief made me finish it this morning
said it was taking too long
will takes the file
flips it open
the death of his partner
pulls out a pen
ellie contd arent you going to read it
i trust you
hands it back to her
she slips it into her bag
ellie contd now i can help you with the connell case
that writers coming in tomorrow
a slight stutter in wills step
duggar called him
about an hour ago
said he was more than happy to cooperate
ellie looks over at will as they cross the street
studying his face
noticing the slight limp in his right leg
the cut on his forehead
ellie contd you havent been sleeping much have you detective dormer
they arrive at the stone steps of the pioneer lodge
isnt that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop
a good cop cant sleep cause a piece of the puzzles missing
a bad cop cant sleep cause his conscience wont let him
smiles you said that once remember
will finally looks at her
but it sounds like something i wouldve said
turns and starts up the steps
will contd see you tomorrow ellie
ellie watches him for a second
then calls out
i forgot to tell you
the puffins won
will stops turns to look back at her
ellie contd the baseball game
slings the bag over her shoulder
ellie contd we won
clock flicks to a
will pacing in his room
rib cage wrapped in a bandage
a stack of messages
all from john warfield
he discards them one by one
can barely focus
suddenly the phone rings
he lunges for it
grabbing it listen to me you son of a bitch
interrupted by a click
i saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him
walter byrds voice
recorded from that afternoon
recorded voice contd seattles great hero
shooting his own partner
i saw it all
will hears his own voice
recorded voice contd that was an accident
then another clumsy click
walter byrd gets on
youd have done the same thing will
i know you would
he hangs up
will slams down the receiver
yanks the cord out of the wall and hurls the phone across the room
the dark figure
disappearing back into the fog
closing in around him like milky water
we whip out our smith
plunge in after him
leaping from rock to rock
the fog blanket thick
tightening around us
up to our ankles
a dark figure
big and hulking
crashing towards us
we raise our weapon
quick as a flash
as the figure emerges
and in a split second
we lock eyes with figures his eyes brown and gentle
the figure grips his gut falls into the water
we slosh towards the body
catching our eye
lying in the rocks
off to the side
we grab it
turn back to the body
and stop cold
thats when it hits us
thats when we realize
will bolts up
white as a sheet
i didnt know
his body drenched in sweat
his breathing quick and ragged
caught up in the twisted sheets of his bed
looks across the room and sees sitting in the corner
eating an apple with a penknife
you sure about that buddy
looks over at the window just as
drops to the floor
light floods the room
with a grunt will puts his back into it
shoving the heavy oak bureau towards the window
sweat beading his face
and the bureau finally stands in front of the window
will stands back to take a look
only covers half of it
red faced will leans into the wooden armoire
shimmying it towards the window
sitting in her truck
parked behind the pioneer lodge
rubbbing her eyes
looking up at concerned
with one last heave will gets the armoire to the window
light still shining through the cracks
will shoving magazines blankets sheets pillows
to fill the cracks
to cover the light
like a crazy mans
suddenly a knock on the door
rachel standing out in the hallway
will opens the door
startled by his appearance will
what is it
theres a guy down the hall
complaining about the noise
beat says he cant sleep
will gives a half smile
heads back into
looks around at the mess
are you alright
will grabs up a sweater
he heads back over to the window
rachel now notices all the stuff piled up
softens her voice
did something happen
cramming the sweater into a crack
rachel walks up behind him
his cramming more desperate
he grabs a magazine
it keeps coming in
rachel reaches out
catches his arm
looks down at her hand
rachel contd what happened
will suddenly realises what hes doing
slowly turns to face rachel
her eyes looking up at him
his shoulders droop
rachel reaches up
catches him in her arms
will buries his face in her neck
wants to be swallowed up
rachel holds him
will breathes her in
sweet soft safe
his mouth suddenly finding hers
a kiss hungry urgent
his arms move to surround her
will and rachel in bed
rachel behind will her finger tracing his scar
rain drums against the window
watching the raindrops streaming down the glass
casting strange shadows against the wall
there was this guy named weston dobbs
worked as a part time stock boy in a copy store
every morning hed sit at the only window in his apartment and watch an eight year old boy get picked up by his carpool across the street
and every afternoon hed watch the boy get dropped off again
he did this for about six months
until one day he got up the nerve to cross the street and grab the boy before his carpool came
kept him in his apartment for three days
made him do things
will tenses his jaw
rachel listens in horror
will contd when he was done he got a rope and a kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the basement of the apartment building
but he didnt do a good enough job
the little boys neck didnt break and he died from shock
the landlord found him five days later
rachel reaches for wills hand
one of your cases
me and hap
a year and a half ago
i knew the second i met dobbs that he was guilty
we had circumstantial evidence but nothing to tie him to it
went over every inch of that apartment
will turns slowly over to face her
her hair splayed out on the pillow
her cheeks flushed
her eyes listening
we took some blood samples from the boys body and planted them in his apartment
beat arrested him the next day
rachel looks at him
goose pimples on her arms
realising the weight of the confession
thereve been other cases
where weve changed results
rubs his face but dobbs
i wanted dobbs more than anything
he sits up
wincing from the pain in his ribs
rests his arms on his knees
what if someone finds out
were under investigation now
back in seattle
beat hap wanted to talk
as soon as we got back
thought he could work out some kind of deal
rachel rubs his shoulder
well thats not going to happen now
will closes his eyes
the rain pattering
do you think it was wrong
what we did
theres a pause
rachel studying wills back
not sure how to answer
there are two kinds of people in alaska
those who were born here and those whove come here to escape something in their lives
beat i wasnt born here will
im in no position to judge anyone
im not about that any more
looks out the window
rachel contd its all about what youre willing to live with
the clock reads
will pulls on his trousers
goes to strap on his smith holster
grimaces with pain
looks at his back in the full length mirror
black bruises seeping out from under his bandage
puts the and holster in the top drawer of the bureau
turns and looks down at rachel
you were acquainted with the deceased kay connell
will in the interrogation room
standing by the window
yes i was
sits at the table
hair combed wet
shirt newly starched
a styrofoam cup of coffee in front of him
playing the part
fred sits opposite him
report file open
ellie next to fred
shes combed her hair too
in what manner
walter smiles modestly
looks over at ellie
she was not quite a fan
more an avid reader of my detective novels
when did you first meet her
fred shoots ellie a look
she closes her mouth
a year ago
at one of my signings
ellie hands fred the hardback of otherwise engaged
he holds it up
opened to the signature
where you signed this
what happened at that signing
she flattered me about my writing
asked if she could visit me
to talk about my books
not that much at first
but then she became more comfortable
started visiting me every week
will from over by the window
what was the nature of your relationship
walter looks over
what do you mean detective dormer
she was an attractive girl
did you have sex with her
she was only seventeen
but she was an attractive girl
did you have sex with her
fred shoots will a look
ellie watching him
but you wanted to
i was a mentor to her
will heads over to walters chair
fists clenched in his pockets
you gave her gifts
a heart necklace
doesnt sound like a mentor to me
i gave her things she didnt have
he turns to fred and ellie
walter contd her family lives on mr
it isnt much
fred stops will with a look
we understand mr
to will you want to sit down detective
will stares at walter
heads back over to the window
she wasnt happy
i was someone to talk to
how do you mean
fred sits up
what about him
takes a sip of coffee
walter contd i dont want to talk out of school
kay told me things in the strictest of confidence
as a friend
anything you can tell us could help out with this case
walter furrows his brow
taps his hearing aid
he hit her
ellies eyes widen
fred glances at will
but wills too busy watching this little man weave his web
are you sure about that
shed come to me sometimes in the middle of the night
bruises all over her back her upper arms
i pled with her to let me call the police but she wouldnt hear it
wanted to keep it a secret
randy stetz beat kay connell
walter looks right at her
he has a terrible rage
kay even said he carried a handgun around with him
this is big
calls out the door
get judge biggs on the phone
to will ill get another warrant for stetzs place
walter takes a sip of his coffee
holds it out to ellie
could i have some more coffee detective burr
ellie nods takes the cup
heads over to the coffee machine
fred turns back to the door
and at that moment walter levels a look right at will
mouths the words wild card
a shiver down wills spine
over at the coffee machine
glances up at the window
catches the reflection of the two men
an intense look between them
close on a boot
jumping down onto a black rock
pull back to reveal ellie walking out on the beach
heading down towards the water
a dark narrow boarding room
a hand reaches through an open window
feels for the lock on the door
will enters randy stetzs place
cigarette butts electric guitar hustler centerfolds tacked on the walls
he looks around
every inch of him revolting against what hes about to do
the sound of waves
a slight breeze
ellie walking along the water
stops and puts her hands on her hips
will heads over to a hanging sheet on the other side of the room
pulls it aside
a motorbike being repaired
parts and tools all over the place
pulls the ruger from his pocket with a handkerchief
spots a coffee can on a shelf
filled with thick oil
something catches ellies eye
glinting from between the rocks
she bends down
pulls a pencil from her backpack
spears something and holds it up
will drops the into the oil
turns and heads back across the room
at the door
looking at the oil can
takes a step back towards it when he hears
the sound of a squad car
pulling up outside
will stands just outside the doorway into randys room
uniformed officers inside searching the place
tearing down pictures
turning out doors
ripping up carpet
you cant fucking do this
will hears some scuffling
the sheet being pulled down
the clatter of tools
im working on that
parts pulled off the shelves
the bike shoved to the side
will shuts his eyes
heavy footsteps head over to the bike
someones pulled the gun from the can
what the fuck is that
freds voice calm
lets bag it
thats not mine man
thats not mine
will opens his eyes
no way man
a chair knocked over
will looks down at the floor as fred and a uniformed cop struggle to drag randy through the doorway
randy writhes kicks tugs
randy contd that aint mine
fred grabs randys shoulder
looks right into wills eyes
gone is the bluster
gone is the attitude
randy stetz lost kid
tears streaming down his face
i swear to god
i didnt kill her
i swear to god
will stands outside the garage apartment
wind whipping his coat
watches as a nightmute pd squad car pulls off with randy stetz in the back
fred sees him heads over
you look like shit cowboy
will shifts his eyes to him
thats an understatement
fred half smiles
watches the receding squad car
looks like we can wrap this one up
will barely nods
fred pulls his baseball cap on
fred contd were getting together for a couple of beers later on
might not be the seattle thing to do
but youre welcome to come
fred puts out his hand to shake
will looks at him
close on a tray of dark beer
five glasses foam sloshing
i cant believe it
pull back to reveal farrell rich francis and will sitting at a small round table
freds passing out the beers
banner on the wall
place packed with rough looking fishermen
rich takes a glass from fred
what do you mean you cant believe it
he was an asshole
that doesnt mean anything
takes a sip of his beer
didnt you grow up with him
farrell shifts in his seat
our dads were on the same boat
to will we used to wait for them together
jostled by the crowd
reaches for his beer
he used to pick fights at the gas station
and remember when he did all those donut holes that one summer
he and francis guffaw
just a bad seed
farrell looks over at will
how do you like our beer
will slams down his empty glass
squeezes his eyes open and shut
i like it fine
fred pats wills shoulder
what detective dormer needs is a little shut eye
the white nights been hard on you
they havent been easy
francis grabs a handful of peanuts
they dont have titanium shades over at the pioneer
well no wonder
you lose all sense of time
better than freds home town
will turns to fred
wiping the foam from his moustache
my people are from barrow
way up north
in the winter theres no sunlight for five straight months
like being swallowed up in a black hole
they look up
ellie standing by their table
jeans down vest
pull up a seat
you hear what happened ellie
rich found the gun
fred leans back in his seat
somethings on nancys mind
ellie reaches into her vest pocket
pulls out a ziploc with the shell casing inside
i found this out on the beach
what is it
let it go ell
we got the bad guy
none of us carries a mm duty weapon
and the murder weapon was a
rich throws peanut shells at her
get a hobby will ya
ellie brushes off the shells
looks right at will
its a legitimate point isnt it detective dormer
everyone turns to will
their faces spinning
he looks up
holds her gaze
then turns away
grabs the side of the table
the case is closed ellie
gets up i got the next round
the guys dont protest
will starts heading for the bar
weaving through broad shoulders massive backs
a mass of bodies and sound
like being swallowed up in a black hole
looks back at the table
ellie watching him
ellies truck pulls up in front of a small house
she jumps out
ellie heads through the front door like a gust of wind
thunders up the stairs
we hear the tv in the other room
an older man ellies father appears in the doorway
thick glasses grey stubble big paunch
wearing a flannel robe
ellie appears at the top of the stairs
wheres all my academy stuff
pitch black then click
as a bare lightbulbs switched on
ellie stands beneath it
piles of crap everywhere
she steps through the quagmire of old bikes fans auto parts
over to a stack of cardboard boxes in the corner
she nudges through them reading the writing on the tops
in thick black pen
shoves a couple aside
finds what shes looking for
pulls down a box marked ellie acad
tears it open
inside piles of papers polaroids of her and her friends schedules syllabi handbooks
stuff from her academy year
at the bottom a report
the title securing the crime scene the leland street murders
by eleanor p
ellie pulls it out
sits down on an old stool
opens to the middle of the report
her finger tracing down the typewritten page
flips to the next page
then the next
she spots it
three quarters down the page her finger finds the sentence
detective dormers unregistered smith and wesson model mm to immobilize langley
ellie looks up
chews her bottom lip
close on a huge wave crashing against a retaining wall
pull back to reveal a small monument by the sea
a stone cupola with a bronze statue underneath
the sky black with clouds
walter byrd waits under the mariners memorial
wind whipping his jacket the green sea churning behind him
next to a fifteen foot statue of a seaman tall rugged tough
holding on to a thick coil of rope
hunches against the wind
will approaches the monument
sonics sweatshirt wrinkled coat
face drawn and haggard
smiles hi will
will enters the monument
what the hell are you doing calling me at the station
a gust of wind whorls through the monument
i figured we should touch base
i think it went well
what did you think
wills eyes pierce into him
randy stetz is in jail
told you i could write an ending
will holds out his hand
will contd the tape
walter looks at the open hand
hugs his jacket to him
i thought maybe we could talk some more
theres nothing more to talk about
but we work so well together
slams him against one of the concrete pilasters
we do nothing well together
slams him again nothing
you understand me
another wave crashes
walter looks up into wills bloodshot eyes
you run on two settings will
ive noticed that
will tightens his grip
walter contd you jump from calm to rage in the blink of an eye
i do that too
he holds up the tape
will grabs it shoves walter to the side
yanks the tape out of the cassette
steps back and hurls it into the sea
waves engulf it hungrily
walter watches him
walter contd youre not sleeping are you
what the hell do you know
kay told me
she comes to me you know
tells me things
walter contd does detective eckhart come to you
will curls his fists
walter contd does he ask you why you shot him
i told you that was an accident
then so was mine
dont you pull that shit with me
i didnt want to kill her will
steps closer to him
walter contd when she called me that night from the party shed had a fight with randy
wanted to talk
i told her to meet me at our special place
the cabin at the beach
a couple ravens alight nearby
flapping their wings
screeching into the wind
walter contd when she came she was barefoot
and there was liquor on her breath
i only wanted to comfort her
to touch her
she could have at least let me do that
it was like everything id ever written about
a dark shadow crosses his face
holds on to the coiled rope of the statue
couldnt get it up walter
it was when i went to kiss her
she started laughing
i got angry
after all id given her
all id shared with her
i just wanted to make her stop
squeezing the bronze rope
walter contd from calm to rage in the blink of an eye
locks eyes with will
walter contd remember
wills hand shoots out
clamps around walters neck
walters face starts turning red
this an accident walter
if you want it to be
will looks deep into walters eyes
it took ten minutes to beat kay connell to death
their eyes locked
veins popping along walters temples
just then a bell sounds in the distance
will looks up
a line of fishing boats coming back in
will looks back at walter
throws him to the ground
will contd get the fuck out of town byrd
leave and never come back
holding his neck
i have a summer house up by kgun lake
im going to write my next novel there
its about a famous detective who goes bad
will shoots him a look
walter contd just kidding
he pulls himself to his feet
a little unsteady
takes out a handkerchief
dabs his forehead
walter contd the never coming back part though
im not sure
to tell you the truth this has been kind of fun
going to the station meeting all those nice people
talking with you
walks past will
walter contd i might miss it
watches him walk away
walter contd i especially like that new detective
will looks at him
walter contd detective burr
smiles i liked her very much
has a real vitality
wills stomach jumps
walter turns back
the little man in a beige windbreaker
close on a hand
signing the bottom of a form
i was hoping not to send you back with so much paperwork will
pull back to reveal chief nyback sitting at his desk
will stands before him
a bottle of bourbon on the desk
some paper cups half filled
chief nyback contd when are you taking off
will checks his watch
fred standing over by the filing cabinet
toothpick in his mouth
if spencers not too drunk to fly
cant talk you into staying for a couple of days
do some fishing
show you what normally goes on around here
will shakes his head
i have to get back
looks over at fred picking his teeth
chief nyback contd brought some real class to the place
but seattle needs its hero back
stands couldnt have done it without you will
will caps the pen
nods towards fred
had a lot of help from nightmutes finest
just then the door swings open
they look over as ellie hurries in
didnt want to miss anything
detective dormers not leaving for a few hours
maybe you could drive him to spencers
an awkward beat
ellie walks over to will
suddenly throws her arms around him
ellie contd i thought what you did on this case was amazing
will holds his hands out
not sure what to do
looks down at the top of ellies head
slips down his back
feeling for a holster
she breaks away
ellie contd were really going to miss you around here
she and will lock eyes
hold for a beat
he knows exactly what she was trying to do
will driving down nightmutes main street
he takes a left
goes up a hill
glances out the window
passing by the cemetery
a cluster of headstones
something catches his eye
he stops the car
will walking up to the wrought iron gate surrounding the cemetery
puts his hands up to the bars
on the other side
a mound of dirt
flowers scattered by the wind
daughter and friend
grips the bars
as if hes seeing it for the first time
really seeing it
closes his eyes
what have i done
wills reflection in the mirror
put on a clean suit
smooths down his lapels
turns to face the room
beds made mess cleaned up
he heads over to the bureau pulls out his smith
lays it on the bed
unclips his badge from his belt
lays it on the bed
takes something from the bedside table
the bullet found in hap eckhart
lays it on the bed
reaches under the mattress
pulls out the photograph of a blurry walter byrd standing in front of a house
a radio tower in the background
the call numbers wkoz
will studies it
tears it in half
rachel in the back room behind reception
a pullmans kitchen a desk an old recliner
pouring some milk into a bowl for a cat
will walks in
rachel turns smiles
i found a new friend
will walks up to her
puts his arms around her
holds her smells her kisses her neck
looks into her eyes
rachel contd will
what is it
he doesnt answer
the cat rubs against his leg
will driving along a forest road
eyes dead ahead
a map on the passenger seat
by the fold kgun lake circled in pencil
ellie working at her desk
looks up at the clock
gets up grabs her down vest
heads for the door
farrell sticks the tip of his crutch in her path
very funny farrell
aerial view of the silver jeep cherokee
the only car on the road
the sky white grey
the trees a blanket of green
the cherokee heads around a hairpin curve
rachel at reception
reading the paper
ellie walks in
will scanning the treeline
takes a left fork then stops
thought he saw something
grinds the gear backs up
takes another look
in the distance a radio tower
rachel and ellie standing outside wills room
ellie knocks again
i would have seen if he came back
the click of a key and the door opens
ellie strides in
rachel behind her
taking in the strange feeling in the room
walks over to the bed
eyes riveted on the
on the bullet
rachel behind her
what is all this
ellie her mind races
notices torn photograph pieces in the trash can
reaches in and pulls some out
will stops the car at the end of a narrow dirt driveway
looming before him
a house right on the lake
tall wooden in disrepair
chipping yellow paint
a ghost of what it once was
the house from the photograph
the clang of electric typewriter keys bang out a title blink of an eye by walter by walter byrd hunched at his typewriter
in an old study
books stacked everywhere
light patches on the walls where pictures used to hang
walter cocks his head
walks over to the window
will walking up to the house
lucy and desi jumping around him
will opens the screen door with a creak
steps into the living room
recoils from the smell
yellow plastic covering the sofas
boxes books papers pictures piled high everywhere
wallpaper faded peeling
ellie ripping along the forest road in her truck
gripping the wheel
the photograph pieces taped together on the passenger seat
will heads down a hallway
dark narrow floorboards worn
more shit stacked up
each step careful quiet
a breeze sweeps through
the burned out lightbulb hanging from the ceiling starts swinging
here to visit me
will whips around
walter standing there
at the other end of the hallway
will shakes his head
flies bouncing against the screen door
will contd im here to end this
walter looks around
wheres your back up
no back up
youre not following procedure
procedure went out the window a long time ago
walter looks at him
were on the same side will
you know that
after what weve been through together
bound by a secret
will takes a step forward
thats where youre wrong walter
slowly reaches into his jacket
will contd there is no secret
because the biggest difference between you and me is what we will or will not live with
pulls out his smith and wesson
looks at the gun
suddenly darts out of sight
swings back into the doorway with a shotgun
wills shoulder explodes with blood
ellie jumping out of her truck
hears the sound
looks up at the big yellow house
pulls out her glock
walter walking down the hall
will writhing on the floor reaches for his back holster
guns not there
walter stands over him
swings his leg back and
kicks will in the ribs
the pain blinding
a vein along his temple
wills eyes flutter
blood spewing from his lips
to his kidneys
walter stops out of breath
hand on hip
you give the police a bad name will
wills hand suddenly shoots out
grabs the shotgun barrel
walter stumbles back
the shotgun goes off
chunks of ceiling rain down
walter falls to the ground
ellie heart pounding
kicks the front door open
will covered in dry wall struggling to his feet
reaches for his smith and wesson
walters desert boot kicks it out of the way
it skitters down the hall
walter grabs his shotgun
scrambles to his feet
runs down to the end of the hall
dirty shelves strings of dust
he races over to a cabinet
yanks open a drawer
will on his feet trying to focus
his suit soaked with blood
looking for his gun
spots it in the corner
walter jerks open another drawer
a stack of books teeter on the top of the cabinet
he finds what he needs
grabs a handful
the books tumble down on top of him
he cries out covering his head
touches his ear panics hearing aids gone
will coming down the hall
will hobbles into the library
sweeps the room with this gun
steps on something crushing it
walters hearing aid
kicks it aside
in the front hall
right hand gripping the gun
left supporting the butt
blinks away sweat
facing three doorways
will limps into the dining room
furniture stacked high
trying to stay conscious
the screen door
suddenly runs past number one
the flash of a gun
she wheels toward it
finger on the trigger
the figure passing
her heart pounding
will dormer or walter byrd
at the last second she jerks the gun away
the figure disappears
gripping the gun
the sky heavy with clouds
the air foreboding
will steals out the screen door
wind bending the weeds the trees
out of nowhere
rips into his thigh
will cries out
a second shot
whizzes past him
the shot bites into the window frame
wings ellie halfway across the room
she drops to the floor
clutching her shoulder
pulls herself over to a sideboard for cover
shrinks behind it
notices a plastic bag sticking out from one of the drawers
nudges it open
a flowered dress some panty hose strands of long dark hair
on the ground
gripping his leg
looking wildly around
no sign of walter
he sees it
lucy and desi
down by the boathouse
old rotted wood
walter stands at a window
re loading his shotgun
he fumbles drops a shell
it rolls towards a crack in the floor
falls into the lake water below
walter levels the shotgun out the window
walters pov the long undulating weeds outside
pulling himself through the weeds
losing blood fast
dragging his body
approaches the side of the boathouse
walters gun barrel sticking out
will ducks his head
winces in pain
breathing becoming ragged
rounds to the other side
hoists himself up to another window
cautiously looks in
walter at the far window
will jerks back
steps on the dock
a plank creaks
peers back through the window
still looking out
didnt hear a thing
walter doesnt have his hearing aid
hes deaf on that side
walter looking out the window
over his shoulder we see will climbing in through the window
smearing blood along the sill favoring his leg
levels his gun at walters back
walter continues staring out the window
will raises his voice
will contd walter
walter jumps whips around
comes face to face with the barrel of will dormers gun
absently touches his deaf ear
drop the gun walter
walter looks at wills
that jammed the last time remember
the men lock eyes
wind howling through the boathouse
killer and detective
only a bullet separating them
walter suddenly jerks up his shotgun
he stumbles back
hit in the gut
wills smith and wesson smoking
no longer jammed
walter touches the blood
looks back at will
the rotting floor gives way beneath him
he cries out falls
drops into the icy water below
will steps over to the hole
looks down at walter floating on his back
looking up at him
water washing over his body
a wave gently pulls him away
will staggers out on to the dock
drops his gun
crashes to his knees
his face pale
lying against the wood of the dock
start to fall
washing the blood from his skin
puckering the lake water
running along the dock
will squints against the rain
makes out the face of ellie hovering over him
he gives a half smile
god youre a pain in the ass
ellie kneels down next to him
pulls over her vest
will looks at her bloody shoulder
ellie tearing off her boot
yanks off her sock
im going to make a tourniquet
will fading fast
walter byrd killed kay connell
her things are in the house
ellie wraps the sock around his leg
doesnt want to ask this
you shot detective eckhart didnt you
a pained looks crosses ellies face
did you mean to
will shakes his head
but i covered it up
rain drumming down around them
will takes a deep breath
because i just couldnt be wrong
looks at her dont ever get that way ellie
dont ever lose your way
it blurs the line
his blood pumping out in rivulets
ellie looks down at him
moves up to the wound in his arm
this one looks worse
will reaches up a feeble hand
whispers just let me sleep ellie
his eyelids growing heavy
will contd let me sleep
ellie blinks away the tears
knows what he means
what he wants
watches as the calm spreads over him
will closes his eyes
will opens his eyes
she ties the second sock around his arm
ellie contd i will not let you sleep
if youve lost your way then you have to make it right
thats the only way
thats what youd tell me
ive been a detective for four weeks and i say youre coming with me
she gets up
slips her arms under his shoulders
starts hoisting him up
ellie contd cmon
struggling to his knees
every inch of him screaming in pain
gets to his feet
arm slung around this tiny young woman
what about your shoulder
ill have a cool scar
and they head slowly but surely back down the dock
