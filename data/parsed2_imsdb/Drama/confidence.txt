confidence by doug jung first draft march so im dead
dumpsters overflow with the days garbage
a pillar of steam rises from an underground grate
its the dark place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids
we see jake vig a guy in his late s whose fashionable suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the surroundings at first glance youd think he could
run for congress some day
at first glance
jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees execution style
his face gives away nothing he could be kneeling in a strawberry field
and i think its because of this redhead
know who i am jake
the anti christ
im not the anti christ
or the prince of darkness
im just a guy looking for some answers
theres the loud unmistakable click of a gun being cocked
the barrel of a gun slides gently along jakes ear and comes to rest at the base of his skull
the voice and the gun belong to butch s
with his suit and conservative looks youd make him out for a steve or roger more than a butch
butch cont d things are probably going to end badly for you jake
what makes you say that
your life flashing before your eyes
just the last three weeks
thats not a bad place to start
title three weeks ago
the same alley
the door of a building bursts open as lionel dolby late s dressed in a cheap suit stumbles out breathing heavy
the dim light of a bare bulb glares off the sweat on his forehead
a moment later jake emerges from the same door carrying a large black revolver
i lost my head
i dont know what happened
y y you fucking shot him
thats what happened
i had to
that motherfucker was about to welch
you saw what he was doing right
you heard him
lionel starts shaking his head spastically
i cant be here
i can t listen to me
it went to shit
it happens sometimes
in the distance a police siren wails growing louder
listen to me
we dont have much time
we can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me
jake takes a tentative step forward
lionel sees a blood stain on jakes shirt and recoils
the siren grows louder jake turning his head towards it
what what do we do
jake waves lionel back through the door they came out of
a dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar
a single overweight patron sits at a corner table with face buried in his hands as he whimpers
jake and lionel dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway
miles late s wipes blood off the bar
placed at the edge of the bar are two briefcases both open both filled with neat stacks of blood splattered money
a dead guy lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood
jake grabs the dead guys legs as lionel watches in disbelief
grab his arms
lionel stands frozen
jake drops the dead guys legs with a thud
yeah maybe you didnt pull the trigger but you were standing right there and watched me do it
grab his arms
the police sirens grow louder
if you wanna help then help
if not shut up
then shut up
miles lets out a little chuckle its just enough to set jake off again
jake pulls the gun and points it at miles
miles non chalantly pulls a sawed off shot gun frown under the bar
miles cont d you think this kinda shit hasnt happened here before
given its usually on thursdays
and usually i gotta tell the cops no officer
i didnt really get a good look at the shooters
without looking up i didnt see nothing
and i swear if you let me go now i wont say relax porkchop
the police sirens sound like theyre right outside
i cant be here
jake cocks his gun never taking his stare off miles
lionel looks at the briefcases of bloodied money
what about this situation makes you think i can answer that question right now
lionel again looks at the briefcases then the shotgun leveled at jake then at the direction of the police sirens
he runs for the door without a second thought
lionel emerges up the stairs from the basement level bar to street level just as a police car screeches to a halt in front of the bar lights flashing siren
on the door is the emblem for the new york police lionel does his best to look casual as two uniformed officers jump out of the car and rush the
one of the officers catches lionel looking over his shoulder
the last thing lionel hears before he turns a corner everybody freeze
as soon as hes turned the corner lionel breaks into a full sprint down the street
officer walter sobozinski a middle aged cop with a couple of spare tires stands by the front door with his gun drawn in a dramatic stance
yelling i said freeze you motherfucking cocksucking scumbags
the second middle aged cop officer richard rottovich comes calmly down the stairs behind sobozinski
rottovich closes the door and locks it behind him
still yelling or ill blow off every one of your fucking heads
sobozinski lets out a bellowing laugh
we pan over to reveal jake miles and big al the patron sitting at the bar by the dead guy
stop waving that thing around
you sure were clear
guy looked like he was trying not to shit himself
re the dead guy nice
what took so fucking long
the dead guy stirs gordo late s dressed in a blood soaked suit stands up wiping blood off his face
ive been lying in this shit like half the night
you guys were late
we had to go to a mexican stand off
and you know i hate guns
jake tosses the revolver on the bar
we were fighting crime
keeping the city streets safe for drug dealers and pedophiles everywhere
jake starts taking the money out of the briefcases
gordo strips out of the jacket and shirt revealing a thin white vest
a wire runs from a battery pack on his belt up the center of the vest ending at a scorched bloody explosive squib
gordo drops the vest along with a plastic bag containing fake blood
a nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot where the squib was
i told you use less powder
but you wont get that splatter effect
jake removes the blood stained bills from the top of the pile
then these go into your cut
big al moves over to the bar
when am i gonna get to play the inside
gordo plays the inside
youre the shill
yeah but come on
all i get to do is cry and get insulted
what are you talking about
you should get a fucking academy award for the shill work you do
off als smile we got it down cold al
you dont want to jinx it by changing something up do you
i m gonna go get eggrolls
anyone want eggrolls
al slaps jake on the back and exits
jake catches gordo hawking over his shoulder
i can feel you looking at me
thats a lot of cash
he came up with it pretty quick
probably some investment banker or convertible bonds broker dickhead
did you see how fast he ran out of here
hes not coming back
i gotta drop a dime
did anybody mess up the hoop
gordo disappears dawn the back hallway
jake rubber bands two small wads of cash and hands them to rottovich and sobozinski
you guys got sack ill give you that much
its just confidence
sobozinski and rottovich head for the door with their newly padded pockets
patting his pocket feels a little light jake
next time were in for twenty
what are you talking about
yeah well sobos kid needs braces
do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture
we got a good thing going here
you want to blow it over an overbite
dont get me wrong jake
i like you boys
you guys are the steadiest business in town
but what can i say
twenty percents still better than what we give to any of the other criminals
all the shit we pulled with you and youre trying to shake us down
you guys got sack
was that a threat
did i hear a threat
rottovich cont d last i remember we were talking economics then this
what happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street
then we gotta pass the call to someone else
sobozinski and rottovich exit
shaking his head cops
butch shaking his head still holding the gun
we cant all be model citizens such as yourself
its all about the money isnt it
isnt it always
a suite in the upscale hotel
miles answers a knock on the door an expensive call girl stands at the door in an overcoat
its what makes us run
and despite what they say it can buy you love
are you ready for me ralph
she lets the overcoat fall open revealing her lack of clothing
gordo stands in front of a mirror trying on a new suit
the sales people fawn over him
it can buy you a new and better you
i just dont know if this says me
whats the fabric
big al has a cordless phone to his ear
it can erase all those things about you that you wish didnt exist
i want to settle up
i havent been ducking you
i told you id get it
big al picks up a chinese take out menu and leafs through it while on the phone
jake walks down the crowded street passing the bars and restaurants of soho
his jackets buttoned up to hide the blood stains
it can make you think youre on top of the world
jake passes a group of well dressed well manicured people waiting in line outside of a trendy bar called wax
among the hip and well dressed he seems out of place at the moment
an attractive blonde in her late twenties lily bumps into jake
she throws jake a smile he cant but help return
they stand for a second facing each other before shes whisked away by an older man dressed in an expensive suit
jakes smile fades as he watches her saunter into the bar but not before she throws him another glance over her shoulder
jake continues on into
a semi crowded bar
not hip and trendy like wax
jake finds an empty stool at the end of the bar and orders a drink
he takes a second to look around at the cliques of people talking laughing having a good time before he pulls a newspaper out his coat pocket
jake takes a pen from the bar and opens to the crossword section
and if you believe that money can do all that for you youre the perfect mark
jack kerouac said that if you own a rug you own too much
i dont necessarily like kerouac and driving cross country isnt exactly my idea of a good time but the guys got a point
jake sits alone with his crossword puzzle
jake enters a sparsely furnished loft
the skyline of brooklyn twinkles through dirty picturesque windows
jake drops his keys on a table and hits a button on an answering machine
you have no new messages
if youve got nothing youve got nothing to lose
and when it comes to money finding it and losing it you always gotta remember how much of its just luck
jake stands his sparse little world addressing the quiet before he fishes for his wallet which he cant find
the realization makes jake smile
then a flapping sound spins him around to see a pigeon flapping up against the inside of a partially opened window
visibly upset by the bird jake moves towards the window and pushes it wide allowing the bird to escape
dumb fucking luck
jake stares out the window after the bird
a nicer apartment than jakes
lionel dolby the mark from the euclid rushes around haphazardly throwing things into a suitcase
theres a knock on the door that stops lionel dead in his tracks
lionel still frozen
the door flies open with a boom
in the doorway we see harlin an older mountain of a man dressed in a plain black suit
behind him is lupus late s dressed in a sweatsuit a pilot could spot from ft
king would like a word with you
r r right now
we have a car waiting
i apologize for the door
a ringing phone
jake stirs on the futon oddly placed on the floor in the middle of the room and picks up the phone
you better get over to als
miles hangs up before jake can answer
jake stands with miles in the sparse living room
big ais body sits reclining on a lazy boy chair eyes bulging open
an open carton of food rests in his lap
a feast of take out chinese surrounds him
the tv blares an old episode of the little rascals
theres a singed neat bullet hole in his forehead
i was supposed to meet him for breakfast
he likes that new ihop they just opened you know
he likes to order that thing
the rutti tutti fresh and fruity thing they got
look what they did to him
right in the middle of his egg foo young
big al stares up at them with those bulging vacant eyes his mouth hanging open
jake reaches down and grabs the remote control and turns the tv off
big al used to send money to his father some vietnam vet slowly losing his mind in a va hospital in cleveland
al was like that
thats why al never played the inside
gordo enters and takes a seat in the back booth with jake and miles
seems lionel dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night
they just pulled him out of the east river
well this is just fucking great
it gets worse
now i know why he was such a good rope
x mean cash
that much and we never had to put him on the send
turns out this ducking moe was an accountant for the king pin
gordo throws jake a hard look letting the news sink in
jake can only slump back into the booth
the cash we fleeced off of him was collection money
he was supposed to take that money and give it to the king earlier yesterday like he does every thursday
cept this time he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the kings money back before any body says boo
whats a king pin
gordo looks to jake but can see that hes still processing the information
currently the king pin is a very large type pole stuck up our asses
same shit just independant
they call him the king pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book
we hide right
shaking his head what are you
let me tell you how good this guy is
last night al calls this bookie to settle up
apparently hes been ducking him for like a month
so the guy asks him where hes got all this money all of a sudden right
what does al do
gordo contd does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking bar mitzvah bond
does he tell him hes been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop
he starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some wall street asshole type
how he fleeced
youre pissed we didnt get credit
no that was the only semi fucking smart thing he said
except anybody thats ever met big a knows that the only thing hes comfortable doing alone is eating
this guys tells this guy that guy tells some other guy eventually it works its way back to someone who works for the king and big al sits on the
lazy boy about to take a big bite of egg foo young
he stops as the front door is kicked open with a crash
big als eyes grow huge as we hear a loud balm
gordo coat d big al gets whacked mid egg foo young
the whole thing took about two and a half hours
thats how good he is
we sure big al threw him to us
all three of them turn their attention out the window
they watch the bustle of people walking past wondering if any one of them is looking back
a bird flew into my house last night
gordo and miles exchange a look unsure of how to respond
jake contd its bad luck
just an idea but lets just fucking split
well meet up anywhere
akron or austin or atlanta
hell find us
we go talk to him
were going to give him the money back
you know what were doing with the money
and what about big al
someones going to find him eventually
then theyll start looking for us too
a waitress approaches
what can i get you guys
and a valium
jake turns his attention out the window
a basement bar in a crummy neighborhood
theres no sign but everything about it says condemned
the euclid was our place
jake miles and gordo sit at the bar of the run down watering hole
jake stands placing neat stacks of money into a fed ex box
gordo fleeced the deed off some idiot in a card game
we used it every now and then for a rag but mostly it was our office
our power point
gordo and miles start unloading the same neat stacks of money from their pockets
its not as much as jake put in
had that thing
shaking his head jake seals the fed ex box then hands the form to miles and
picks up the phone
miles contd do we want insurance
off their looks im just asking
just mail it to the hospital
its regarding an accounting problem
i know where it is
that will be fine
jake hangs up the phone
were going too
alright lets all put our dicks back in our pants for a second
is this the best thing to do
jake levels a stare at gordo for a second
meet me at my place later
how do you know the kings going to let you walk
im getting a ride
jake picks up the phone and dials another number
a neon sign in the shape of a boxing glove tells you what kind of gym it is
a police car comes to a stop in front
rottovich and sobozinski in the front seats
jake gets out of the back
the king huh
dont dick around too long
and if he stabs you or shoots you or causes any other form of profuse bleeding call a cab because you are not getting back in this car
jake nods and approaches the door where harlin and lupus stand vigil
lupus wears another loud sweatsuit
we appreciate your punctuality
king is expecting you
jake takes a step towards the door but is pushed up against the wall by lupus who begins to roughly pat jake down
you said pat him down im pattin him down
harlin shakes his head and pushes lupus out of the way
it only takes a moment to be polite
my apologies mr
if you wouldnt mind
jake steps back and raises his arms
you the one that did it
you the one that got al
king prefers to farm out for that kind of work
gesturing to the door please after you
harlin gives the officers sobozinski and rottovich a slight nod of acknowledgment
harlin and lupus lead jake through the cavernous gym
all around them huge sweaty boxers work the speed bag jump rope spar etc
theres not one that doesnt look like hes spent some time in the state penal boxing league
a little nervous uh
which ones the king pin
hes in the back taking a steam
jake nods and lets out a silent sigh of relief
a huge room filled with steam
harlin and lupus stand by the door as jake cautiously steps in
new age music is being played could be yanni
sitting in a lounge chair wearing a white terry cloth robe is the king pin
his large body is less fat than just big constructed of circles and topped off with the baldest head youve ever seen
a manicurist sits next to the king pin working on his nails
watch the pinkie
this isnt so bad
jake almost has to stifle a laugh
king pin contd every time you get the pinkie and i get a hang nail
to jake you jake
jake nods and the king motions for the manicurist to leave
where have you been on the grift
couldnt been here long cause i would have heard of you skippy
you can call me jake
here and there
here and there scooter
here and there like boston chicago houston
the bay area
some action in london til it turned nickel and dime
or how about that little stint down in miami
heard you actually got into some trouble with the feds down there
you guys pretty good
i have a good crew
jake visibly bristles
you know back in the day grafting was considered a gentlemans racket
good suits good food
the underworld of the underworld
a grifter had to survive on his wits his instincts
i like that
i like the idea of that
these days things being what they are guys like me gotta stay low
king pin cont d its all take take take
you can t just be fucking witty about it
i guess it lacks a certain style
of course your line of works only as good as the people you find
you cant cheat an honest man
you cant cheat an honest man
but a man like lionel dolby
i apologize for the inconvenience
the king picks up a long metal nail file
just give me the money back and all will be forgiven
i cant do that
let me rephrase i won t do that
let me repeat why not
because you killed one of my crew
buddy that was business
besides you have more crew
then theres you
ill get the money back plus interest
i go on the grift for you
you get a cat i get a cut
and we get square
laughing fucking grifters
i love it
you got balls ill give you that much
the king pin stands up and moves over to jake
i ll be honest with you kid
a grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar d k fucking n y suit cooler than an eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for
first thing i have to ask myself is is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me
you tried it once
we got caught
so you know it wont happen again
with surprising speed the king pin grabs jake by the neck
i know it wont happen because youre going to feel like a prom queen who just got gang fucked by the wrestling team
a few pained chokes from jake as his knees buckle
vig arrived with an escort
the king loosens his grip and lets jake fall
always working an angle
i can see you got some vision
but i give you the mark
i tell you the who and you give me the how
lupus go with him
lupus snaps to attention
consider him part of your crew
consider him a part of me
jake begins to speak but is silenced with a look
now let me see your hands
the king picks up the nail file again
you ask a lot of questions
motioning with nail file let me see em
jake turns to find lupus and harlin on either side of him
they take him by the wrists and hold his hands up for the king
king pin cont d i dont like to ask things more than once junior
i want you to know how much that irks me
the king begins to gently trace between jakes fingers with the nail file
jake remains rigid against lupus and harlin as the nail file scrapes along the soft fleshy webbing between his fingers
jake shuts his eyes
then opens them to find the king now gently stroking his hands almost a loving caress
you have incredibly soft hands
they re like a babys hands
grifters with rough hands
you know that theyre probably not that good
means theyve had to do some hard labor to make ends meet
the king continues to stroke jakes hands with his own meaty paws
are you insinuating that the king pin is of an alternative lifestyle
jake shakes his head slowly
im not saying anything
besides youre one to talk
youre the one whos got me on my knees in a dark alley
and these cops
what do they get
rottovich and sobozinski sit staked out in front of a small cigar magazine store
just a tip
what are we gonna do with this stuff anyway
what the hell do you do with heroin
you sell it
dont be an idiot
how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealers drugs to another drug dealer
if vigs right we might be looking at a hundred maybe a hundred fifty grand
you think this is a good idea
we never did this kinda shit before
whats he going to do
file a missing drugs report
if it works out this guy might be good for a few more turns
a hooded figure turns a corner onto the street heading for the cigar shop
he wears a knapsack slung over his shoulders
those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me
one fifty every time they tighten those bitches up
its not even covered
they dont cover cosmetic
rottovich cont d last year i had a tooth capped
the dentist tells me im not covered for caps
parked across the street and well hidden among the other parked cars
special agent gunther moonan a guy in his early s in the kind of suit youd find on a for rack
he sits pointing a telescope microphone out the window wearing headphones
he chews on gum loudly
from headphones bullshit its cosmetic
my fucking tooth was cracked in half
i made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity
the departments dental is for shit
from headphones whoa whoa
there he is
we hear the sounds of car doors opening then slamming moonan puts down the mic and hits stop on a microcassette recorder
confessions of a poor brusher
moonan takes a second to remove his gum then checks his teeth in the rearview mirror
rottovich and sobozinski walk quickly down the street
ahead of them the hooded figure approaches his hands buried in his pockets a knapsack slung over his shoulder
as he gets closer we see that hes just a kid of about ten or eleven
rottovich reaches over and pulls off the kids hood
you know who we are
rottovich cant help smiling
were the heat
yelling the kid jumps back startled and throws his hands up
the cops share a laugh
put your hands dawn
what do you got in the bag
something for my pops
well your pops has been making you carry around drugs for him
were going to have to take them
the kid hesitates for a second before handing the knapsack over
rottovich opens it and pulls out two bricks of heroin wrapped in plastic
he nods to sobozinski
the kid stays rooted right where he is looking up at the detectives like a lost puppy
my pops is going to be mad
give the kid a twenty
sobozinski fishes in his pocket starts to peel off bills for the kid who then sprints away
whats the world coming to
everybodys on the friggin take
rottovich and sobozinski head off with the knapsack
butch and jake
keeping the fix happy
you never know when you can use a crooked cop
i want to know how you got lionel dolby
so you want to know how to play the big con
in this case you might say i want to know how not to play the big con
butch shoves the gun a little harder into jakes head
a trendy bar dimly lit and packed
we pan along the hip crowd and stop on jake speaking with a slick guy dressed in black armani
first thing about being on the grift
youre only as good as your mark
the ropers the guy who finds them
jake buys another round to the indifferent slick
they all have money one way or another
some of them come from money
the scene doesnt change slick morphs into a fat texas business man wearing a ten gallon hat
he doesnt smile
theres that saying show me an honest man and ill show you a natural born liar
theres always that little bit of bad no matter how much good
its that little itch on the back of you neck
you may not even know its there but it is
the fat texan morphs into a wall street type suit who remains stoic as jake reaches over for another round of drinks
a good roper knows how to scratch it you the outdoorsy type
i was just fly fishing out in montana
you play the market
i just got a tip on a tech start up ipo
you saw the riverdance twice
i had a roommate in college who was gay
wall street morphs into a thin euro trash man who takes a drink from jake without even a thanks
it means that in fifteen minutes were on good terms
thirty im your buddy
euro trash morphs into an distinguished looking older man as he takes a sip
in an hour im your best friend
jake punctuates some unheard point with a slap on his knee
give me a day and youll let me do your wife and daughter at the same time
its too late for you
jake looks up as the older man morphs into lionel dolby the nervous mark from the earlier con
i have your confidence
close up dolbys lips loosen in a wide smile
jake smiles back
he puts his drink down then takes the drink from dolby
they remain talking as the background under the light of a streetlamp the two continue to talk
i tell you the tale its the story of how were going to make easy money
no one gets hurt
and heres the guy whos going to help
thats when you meet the insideman
gordo approaches dressed in a suit and looking slightly anxious
introductions are made
the insidemans the one with the know how the scoop the angle
but maybe you re the suspicious type
so i give you the convincer
we both put up a little and we get a little back
just a taste
gordo pulls an envelope out of his coat and gives it to dolby
just enough that when i tell you we can make more off of it you agree
jake speaks quickly to dolby who nods emphatically
he hands the envelope back to gordo
that s when i put you on the send
you put in a little you got a little
put in a lot
i send you out for mare
as much as you can get
jake stands talking directly to camera loading a big black revolver with bullets
doesnt matter what the con is
insider trading a line we got on a bookie club insurance scam whatever
you saw the money and you want it
more of it
who cares if you have to bend the rules a little
as long as no one gets hurt
jake spins the gun cylinder then slaps it closed pointing it straight at the camera
jake contd then someone does
a flash of gordos stunned face before his chest explodes jake stands holding the smoking gun
dolby looks around in shock
turns to face camera frankie suits always said that what you have to understand about any confidence game is that its like putting on a play where everyone knows their
the roper the insideman the shills
everyone except for the mark
gordo lying in a pool of blood
while playing dead ive been shot
big al sits cowering at a table
dont kill me
miles casually washing glasses
indifferent you better hurry
the police will be here any second
breaking character i dont really understand my motivation with this
why am i washing glasses
still facing camera now youre an accomplice in a homicide
everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg
dolby turns to jake eyes wide lips trembling in fear
turning to dolby you should be running out the door desperate to forget this ever happened ready to repent your greedy ways
dolby eyes the briefcases of money
turns back to camera then there it is again
that little itch
theres a guy holding a smoking gun a guy bleeding all over the floor and still all you can think about is the money
you twisted fuck
so we gotta give you the blow off
we make sure that you never ever want to look for us again
we get you off our backs
jake stops for a second and listens
he points over his shoulder and on cue a police siren wails in the distance
and thats why you need the fix
dolby bolts for the door without the money
dolby tries to act casual as he walks away
rottovich and sabozinski enter the front door
the new york police departments finest
half as smart and twice as crooked as the guy they just chased away
butch eases the gun off jakes head
so howd you get caught
suits used to say that in any con sooner or later someones going to start asking the right questions
usually it takes a little longer
empty except for gordo miles jake and lupus dressed in another of his trademark loud sweatsuits
were working for the king
re lupus wait a second
whos the mope
im the kings eyes and ears
just in case you decide to get cute
so we gotta short con our way out of a hundred and fifty grand
that could only take like a year
one rag and we get out from under all this
but we need another shill
what do we need another shill for
a crowded night
lily the attractive blonde from earlier flirts with a well dressed older man who has his hand firmly planted on her ass
she squeezes his hand and gives him a quick peck on the cheek before walking away
she takes a look at the mans wallet she just lifted before putting it in her bag
from out of nowhere jake bumps into her
not so innocently oops
jake takes her by the arm out to
jake pushes lily through the back door where she finds gordo miles and lupus waiting
her once flirtatious demeanor is replaced by something harder
what is this
you guys cops or something
were not cops
you gotta be kidding me
wheres my wallet
jake takes her bag and dumps the contents on the floor a few wallets a watch even a wedding ring
jake picks up one of the wallets filled with cash
lily contd thats not pocketing the wallet you interested in a little work
lily scoops up her bag and finds a cigarette eyeing them all suspiciously
sorry about your wallet but if you think im going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars a waxed out visa and a bad fake i
youre fucking crazy
lighting the cigarette jake
take a deep breath and count to ten
its not that kind of work
youre lily right
youre working daffys block
he was going to break your kneecaps
pick pockets can be so bitchy sometimes
i told him you were with us so thats two you owe me
lily takes a second to look the guys over
miles gives her a wink
lily slowly raises her middle finger at him
we have work
it pays a lot
unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up
what do you care who feels me up jake
unless it kinda gotcha going
did it jake
lily saunters to jake with a seductive grin
jake may be aware that hes stopped breathing
she puts her hands on jakes chest and leans in a half inch more her lips an eyelash away from his
lily cont d keep the wallet
take a deep breath
count to ten
and go fuck yourself
lily pushes past jake and heads out of the alley
is it just me or is there something really hot about a girl telling you to go fuck yourself
gordo gives jake a nod of approval and jake takes off after lily
lily down the street jake giving chase
you got the job
now i dont have to find that bridge to jump off
jake catches up and blocks lilys way
we had to see what your deal was
im just a little superstitious
heres my deal dont waste my time
what do you want me for anyway
you dont even know me
i just have a good feeling about you
havent you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before
lily studies jakes face for any hint of sarcasm
beat whats my cut
you get an equal cut
what do i have to do
just play a part
a little acting
lily steps back and hails a cab
make a wish
she points to a large digital clock hanging in a store window reading p
if youre superstitious make a wish
lily hops into the cab and tosses jakes new wallet onto the sidewalk
lily contd thats twice
the cab pulls away
jake looks up at the clock p
i can see why you liked her
that was it
we had our crew
now we needed the mark
jake stands in front of the crew miles gordo lily and lupus
gordo and miles both do their best to contain their disbelief
because thats who the king fin wants us to fleece
and gillettes perfect
a circle of business men sitting at a conference table
his grandfather used to run liquor during prohibition and his father made a bundle in illegal importing and exporting
that makes him a third generation crook
jake cont d hes been tied into pretty much everything drugs mob money rinsing
we pan around the table of business men and settle on morgan gillette a man in his early fifties with the sharp angular features of a reptile
we stay with morgan as the meeting breaks and everyone heads for the door and into
gillette is greeted by a handful of suits
butch is with them staying in the periphery
theres a story going around that he helped fund the contras back in the eighties
gillette and his crew head through a large glass revolving door to
a busy mid day new york sidewalk
gillette heads towards a waiting town car
most of his moneys clean
a lot of it isnt
the best part is that we know exactly where it is
as gillette and his crew disappear into the car we pan up to see the front of the building which has a large sign reading city bank of manhattan a
gillette family company
jake looks over the crew who are less than convinced
how much we going after
miles lets out a whistle
we only owe the king a hundred and fifty
we get fifty percent
and we get clear of the king
jake looks over at lupus for confirmation
thats worth it right there
you ask me i dont think you can do it
im with jack lalane
that guys untouchable
thats why we dont go after him directly
the marble floor spotless the dark oak teller windows vacant a row of desks
we find a doable guy in gillettes bank
someone about mid level
not too high not too low
a lone man grant ashby materializes behind a desk on the empty floor and sits behind a computer terminal
we meet him with corporate papers inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital
the corporate papers are in order but we need things to happen fast
our guy fudges numbers in the right places moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom depending upon what we need
he works for gillette
we pay better
an envelope stuffed with cash materializes on the desk next to ashby
crystal clear water gently rolls onto a white beach
our guy gets us approved for the start up capital
but the money cant be transferred to any one person
on the given day the moneys wired into a corporate account in an off shore bank
another empty bank
a lone teller materializes behind the counter
that same day i show up in the caymens with the proper i
and corporate papers to make a withdrawal
jake materializes on the empty bank floor walking confidently up to the teller with a silver briefcase in hand
im just thinking out loud here but
two million in a briefcase
jake approaches the teller now wheeling a black suitcase behind him by the handle
jake presents the teller with a series of papers and a photo i
its bank policy not to release this money in cash because its under a corporate account
the teller turns to a computer printer and removes a check
jake signs a few documents and places the check into his pocket
lined with shops and stores but its as empty as the bank
not even a car jake strides out of the grand caymens bank and walks across the street to another building with a sign reading bank of the grand caymens
jake strides in and approaches the deserted teller counter
another teller materializes and greets him with a smile
so we cash the check at another bank
jake slides the suitcase and the check over to the teller
like the banks empty
jake walks with the suitcase down the flourescent lit hall towards a series of tables under a sign marked customs
now this is the most important part you cant just walk into the united states with a suitcase full of cash without evoking the words cavity search
as we get closer to the customs desk a customs officer wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a badge materializes behind it
thats why you need someone on the inside at customs
jake approaches and slides the suitcase towards him
the officer slides it back to jake revealing another envelope stuffed with cash under it
the officer literally looks the other way as he pockets the envelope and waves jake through the gate
jake exits the terminal
outside the street is empty not a traveler an airlines rep a luggage handler or a cab
jake waits at an empty cross walk until the walk signal is given
then we disappear
as he walks away we see some people materialize carrying luggage
then a few cars
then an airline rep
gradually more and more people and cars each materializing into a normal scene at the airport until we lose jake in the crowd
jake stops and gauges the crew for their reactions which are the same all the way around slack jawed disbelief
breaking the silence this might just be me but that is hands down the dumbest fucking idea ive ever heard
people have tried this before jake
its never worked
teddy fraiser and his crew went on vacation in chicago for it
last year mumps got pinched in l
it never worked before because a they didnt flush the bank enough b their corporate papers were for shit c they didnt have someone on the inside with customs
yeah or d its a dumb fucking idea
then what do you want to do miles
we never had a problem with that before
yeah well we never had this kind of problem before
what are you talking about
yes we have
and we would have been beautiful about it
we wouldve had a bucket of chicken delivered to the king with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it
then we woulda moved on til the next local putz caught on
were getting a little old for running
yeah well were still a little young for albany state prison
are you pissed about al
im pissed too but i m not like twenty five to life pissed
im getting clear of this
if youre not going to do it for the fucking principle do it for the money
no not whatever
youre either in or you re out
a silence falls over everyone
her eyes stay on jake as a smile grows across her face
jake dials a number
i agreed with miles
it was hands down a dumb fucking idea
but they bought it
now i had to deliver and i needed help
jake into phone yeah its jake
howd that tip work out
butch takes out a cigarette
but there were other factors
factors that werent clear to me until now
an office of empty chairs and desks
through the windows we can see the hustle and bustle of the precinct
special agent gunther moonan still dressed in the same shitty suit sits behind a desk as rottovich and sobozinski enter
special agent gunther moonan
moonan quickly flashes a badge and his best kodak smile
you are officer richard rottovich
and this would be officer walter sobozinski
im looking for jake vig
ive been looking for this jake vig for some time now
problem is the guys the invisible man
a spook a spectre a ghost
then like a gift jakes good buddy and member of his crew alfonse moorely is found the other day with a hole in his head
moonan holds up crime scene photos of big als body
moonan contd preliminary forensics suggests he was
sitting there bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours
alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered so you can imagine the smell
bad for the neighbors good for me because in all the time ive been looking for jake this is only the second time ive even gotten a whiff of him
look special agent moonan
we dont know what youre talking about
moonan takes out a microcassette recorder and hits play
from tape dont be an idiot
how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealers drugs to another drug dealer
if vigs right we might be looking at a hundred maybe a hundred fifty grand
moonan kills the recorder
oh yeah i almost forgot
the two serious looking gentlemen outside
the officers look out the window to see two serious looking men in suits
do you want to know the first time i had a line on vig
he sent me a birthday card
off their silence belated but its the thought right
oh this pricks got a sense of humor
but then again you guys probably know him better than i do
in fact ive only met the guy once
but now now i have you
the next best thing
what do you want
you help me catch him
whatever hes into next i want you to be into
and what youre into im into
if it all goes well those two guys from iad will never have to hear this tape
ill clear you guys of anything youve ever done with vig under the guise of some cross departmental investigation
this pricks been on the wish list for so long youll probably get gold shields out of it
what do you get out of it
peace of mind
not everyones on the take walter
if you feds are so hot for him why dont we just bring him in right now
i want him for something big and to do that we have to catch him in the act
this guy must have been a real pain in your dick
its not a bad deal gentleman
i get peace of mind
you get detective sheilds
but this is the best part walter
walter your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile
rottovich and sobozinski remain silent
one more thing
you gotta give up the booty
i cant have you guys running around with heroin
let me tell you something about moonan
a serious look comes across jakes face hate
butch eases back with the gun for a second
hes just as crooked as the next guy
youd think hed have more important things to do with tax payer dollars
cue the fucking violins
its getting cold
gordo miles jake and lily next to him all crammed into a booth
am i the only one who feels like we cant make a move with this guy on us
we should ditch him
just watch every thing you say around him
every word every move
it all goes back to the king pin
lupus exits the restroom heading back towards the booth
hows the hoop superstar
what is it with you and bathrooms
he doesnt like using a bathroom unless he knows its clean
you laugh now but wait until you need a clean place to powder
this is new york city sister
public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda
you know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob
lets do the list
hepatitis influenza the flesh eating disease heres whats going to happen
gordo we need to find a guy in gillettes bank
miles we need papers corporate insurance
is it all fugasi
no the corporate papers have to be legit
but you gotta score an i
a clean one
talk to suits
i gotta get us a banker
what about customs
ill worry about customs
hey i m not just along for the ride so i dont want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut
take a deep breath
you sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something
jake rolls his eyes as lily glares at him
boxers at the bags a jumping rope etc
jake and lily stand in front of the king pin whos dressed in shorts and a t shirt
he wears boxing gloves and headgear
lupus and harlin stand vigil by the sparring ring
i think two million
what do you need from me
if you can fleece him for two million then do it kid
i need you to stake me
i need you to stake me
i cant do it without it
its just a couple hundred grand
taken out of our cut when were done
king pin eyes jake suspiciously for a second
thats more than you already owe me
what happens if you fuck this up
nothing ventured nothing gained
do i have the word chump tattooed on my forehead
king i think w a look hey i got it
take some mental notes
you just might learn something here
lily just shrugs and rolls her eyes
listen scooter no you listen
were partners now and even though im running the show for you im still running the show
that means i get a little respect
so i dont want to hear anymore of this scooter buddy junior skippy tiger bullshit
and i gotta tell you for a guy who spends all his time in a gym you could be in better shape
a few of the boxers training around stop and turn
the king pin lowers a glare at jake
take off your shirt
jake looks behind him to see harlin looming
i said take off your fucking shirt
a few more boxers stop and turn
jake notices hes being watched
the king pin takes a step towards jake
you want me to take it off ill take it off
jake unbuttons his shirt and stands in front of the king pin arms crossed
its getting weird
look at you you skinny prick
youre not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything are you
the king smiles and begins to take off his shirt
harlin and lupus share an uncomfortable glance
the king strips down to the waist and reveals an incredibly large incredibly round stomach which he slaps loudly
the king grabs jakes hand and puts it on his stomach
it just got weirder
now the whole gym has stopped everyone focused on jake and the king pin
you guys are freaking me out
thats solid muscle
not an ounce of fat
i am not going the king starts to get that look again
jake winds up and punches the king in the stomach
he shakes his fist in pain
i think i just broke my hand
remember i killed your buddy
jakes demeanor changes as he winds up and hits the king as hard as he can
the king just smiles
king pin contd all muscle
the king then hits jake back in the gut with surprising speed
jake falls to his knees but the kings right there
with one arm he pulls jake up and starts to pummel him in the stomach with an unbridled visciousness
jake spits up blood as the king hurls him face first into the ring
maybe its true
maybe you cant cheat an honest man
im about as dishonest as they come and thats the truth
but if you even think about trying to con me theyll find fucking pieces of you in each of the five boroughs
pieces of you pieces of her pieces of your whole crew
cant be any mare honest than that
ill stake you but thats three hundred fifty youre in the hole and consider the juice running
now go make me proud
harlin and lupus lift jake up
lily looks at jake with a pained expression
you get all that
everyone in the gym goes back to their workouts
butch lets out an easy laugh
we got our stake
now we need to find our guy in gilletts bank
a flood of people exit the bank at the end of the day
jake lupus lily miles and gordo wait by the side of the building
miles reads off a piece of paper
what youre looking for in a mark is someone whos weakness you can exploit
miles points out a woman crisply dressed in a suit michelle strigo
they follow her down the street
guy like me with people like that
ill tell you what youre looking for without even meeting you
its like a personal ad you wear over your head
jake watches as she hails a cab
a man also hailing a cab goes for the same one
michelle gets into a screaming match with the man
freeze frame on michelle a cgi sign appears over her head single volatile confrontational woman seeks man for economic security and house chores
a flood of people exit the bank at the end of the day
jake lupus lily miles and gordo wait by the side of the building
vp international finance
miles points out a jay housler a young guy in suit
they follow him
jake and the others watch jay standing around the bar silently scoping the place with a group of young tucks dressed oddly alike
freeze frame on group a cgi sign appears over their heads young wall streeters seek acknowledgement of monetary earning potential from supermodel types ages
the same flood of people exit the bank
jake lupus lily miles and gordo wait by the side of the building
miles points out alice tanner a mousy looking woman in a bad skirt
she gets to the intersection and waits for the light to change even as hordes of others jaywalk the way new yorkers do
freeze frame on alice a cgi sign appears single woman looking for opportunity
plays by the rules and willing to claw her way up to middle management
again the flood of people
again jake lupus lily miles and gordo wait
vp of corporate loans
miles points out a grant ashby a schlubish middle aged balding guy walking down the street
dark oak and brass the bar plays host to legions of suited urban professionals gathered in cliques
jake and the others watch as ashby makes his way through the crowd taking a seat alone at the bar
freeze frame on ashby a cgi sign appears over his head single male seeks end to safety of tedious and solitary lifestyle
moral and ethical constitution flexible
what youre looking for in a mark is someone whos got nothing to lose
no friends no family no life
youre looking for a guy who doesnt own a rug
jake watches as ashby orders a drink and pulls a newspaper from his coat
he opens it to the crossword just like jake would
jake watches ashby do the crossword puzzle alone
i m sure
jake miles gordo lily and lupus enter a warehouse housing racks of clothes
now we had the con and the mark
we needed to look the part
theyre greeted by frankie suits an ancient rake thin man perfectly coiffed and exceptionally dressed
frankie suits was a legend in certain circles
was on the grift since he was ten
last of the red hot grifters
suits grabs jake with a hug
its a heartfelt one
the others exchange greetings with suits who moves over to lupus and studies his loud sweatsuit
back in the day suits made money running fight stores and the wire with a fix so tight it was like a legit business
i never understood what the point was if grifting became like a regular job
we need wardrobe
frankie re lupus so i see
in from long island
you fellas take a look around
you got anything in like a eleven or twelve ounce super worsted
miles gives him a look like hes speaking latin
jake and lily follow suits into
a spare little office piled high with clothes
suits reaches into a desk drawer and pulls out a large envelope and slides it to jake
corporate papers with the new york state seal insurance documents with a proof of bonding and some fugasi financial records
theres also the i
you asked for
corporate papers with the new york state seal insurance documents with a proof of bonding and some fugasi financial records
theres also the i
you asked for
jake takes out the papers and gives them the once over
he then puts an envelope thick with cash on the desk
not easy pickins
papers like these speak to larger issues
sorry about alfonse
off jakes nod you into something big
in over your head
suits eyes lily
can i speak to you in confidence
suits gives lily another suspicious look
try and keep up
you ask for the advantage goods then you guys come in looking to be bean traps
so i gotta think youre either working the mace or playing the jug mob
a little bit of both
lily watches in utter confusion
hey i been on the ramp all my life so i got no problem with the way you help yourself jake
suits contd i saw you go up from the knecker working that grind learning the barnards law and i thought the kids a prodigy
but i know that if youre using these goods
so then i figure whats worth that
youre either looking for a little history or a retirement fund
whos the mark
then whos the banker
a dead look comes over suits
jake you play the heavy rackets like that
they put the lug on for nothing at all
i can handle it
i dont doubt your talent
you looking for that place in the hall of fame
its not history
so what do you want
i want to get out from under all this for good
and i want to fuck them all doing it
then i gotta say in my opinion you cant get what you want
jake considers those words for a moment
yes i can
suits guages the seriousness in jakes face and nods
the he gently rests his hands on the papers
cant do it suits
i cant lay down for this one
heres the thing
you fall flat you might not get anything short of stiffed
then its blue river land for everybody
papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply then they start to take shape
usually its the shape of an arrow
i hate to do it but after this i gotta give you the blowoff
we jake jake
suits holds out his hand
jake takes it
they shake knowing itll be the last time
we follow lily and jake out of suits office
lily can see that its thrown jake a bit
what the hells his problem
dont worry about it
its just that i left my asshole decoder ring at home so how do i know not to worry
jake stops and turns to her looking her up and down
you need to get a haircut
and some new clothes
were going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy if not be classy
you gotta do this thing and i dont even know if you can
youre just going to have to trust me
i dont trust anyone
then show me how
jake and lily enter the store
jake takes a quick moment to case the place a few scattered customers some being helped by salespeople
all the customers look like the uppercrust crowd youd expect at tiffanys
to himself oh yeah
this is good
this will do nicely
to lily this is about confidence
your confidence and their confidence
you get their confidence by giving them yours
jake leaves lily by the front counter as he starts a slow turn around the store
he casually pretends to be browsing as he moves next to mr
lewis an older distinguished looking gentleman being helped by a salegirl who is scribbling on an order form
let me read this back
one silver cattier watch engraved to carolyn the attorney at law
happy graduation counselor
love mom and dad
one bracelet engraved to abby
happy th anniversary love tom
i ll just go put this in mr
the salesgirl takes the order form and walks away
a change comes over jake
its subtle posture facial expressions a slight tug of an accent but its there
lewis turns and looks at jake
theres no real hint of recognition but jakes smiling up at him like an old friend
it is you
jake extends his hand
sorry i jake
i go to lawschool with your daughter
we met once or twice
lewis seems to search for second then extends his hand more in an effort not to appear rude
nice to see you
well it certainly is a coincidence
here of all places
how is mrs
the salesgirl returns
i believe youre holding something far me under pearson
do you have a ticket
you know this is kind of embarassing but my wallet was stolen yesterday and im afraid the ticket was in it
but the names pearson
while youre back there could you make sure that carolyn is spelled with a y
the salesgirl nods and disappears again
lewis contd what brings you down from boston jake
taking advantage of the long weekend
my wife and i are just taking a little vacation
behind his back jake discreetly waves lily over
carolyns down this weekend too
when she does jake pulls her close and gives her a loving kiss on the lips
it throws lily for a second
honey this is mr
carolyn lewiss father
lewis this is my wife lily
lily and mr
lewis exchange handshakes
im sorry honey
im almost done
jake taps lily on the back with the hand wrapped around her waist
ill be looking for earrings
jake gives lily another kiss before she leaves
actually its our first anniversary this weekend
she thinks im here to pick up something for my mother but its actually a gift for her
think ive fooled her
take it from me you never do
nice to be married isnt it
very much so
jake smiles ear to ear like the happy newlywed hes pretending to be
the salesgirl returns
we have carolyn with a y
im sorry theres nothing under pearson
if we had an invoice number jakes smile dissolves as he grows a little anxious
i told you
my wallet was stolen
jake takes a nervous look over at lily who is drying on earrings with another salesperson
he and jake shake hands
thank you sir
you know i hope this isnt too much of an inconvenience but if carolyn is coming down for the weekend perhaps i could give you something for her
its a check
we split the cost on a few books and i havent had the chance to pay her back yet
jake pulls out a checkbook and pen
writing thatd be a great help
the salesgirl returns
nothing under pearson
just a complete disaster
what was it
jake quickley scans the jewelry in the glass case
a ring for my wife
alot like that one
in fact it was that one
thats no problem
we have those in stock
sorry im just a little anxious to give it to her
you take out of state checks
jake stops writing on the check and locks up
i understand that but i had my wallet stolen last night
is there any way
jakes anxious look comes back
i know its policy but
looking over at lily the thing is
its our first anniversary and were only in town for the weekend
its a very very special night for my wife and i
this ring is my gift to her and i think shes going to really love it
i can give you phone numbers to call for people wholl vouch
i can send you i
sympathetic im sorry
clearing his throat this is embarrassing
jake looks up and rips the check out from his book
im sorry sir
thank you very much for doing this
and please tell carolyn hello for me
jake seems to be lost
lewis looks over at lily who gives him a friendly smile then back to jake
why dont you let me put the ring on the card and you can write me a check in return
unseen to mr
lewis one corner of jakes lip goes up in a grin
jake and lily exit the store
jake hands lily the trademark colored box
lily takes the box and shakes her head impressed
jake looks up to see mr
lewis watching them as he tries to hail a cab
jakes demeanor quickly changes as he puts on a big smile
you just got a present from the man of your dreams
lily puts on a big smile while opening the box
now we gotta give him a strong finish
jake pulls lily closer and looks into her eyes
she leans in and they kiss a deep slow kiss that makes people have to walk around them
lewis sees them and smiles to himself as he gets into a cab
jake and lily are still kissing as the cab pulls away
lily finally breaks the kiss slowly
i gotta go get a haircut
jake watches as lily walks away
she looks back at jake once before disappearing around a corner
moonan sits on a desk ear to a phone
it was all in play
im in new york
listen i got vig
hes here and im this close
look i understand that but im telling you this time
obsessive is a big word to use
goddamn it lou
im telling you this is it
i figured youd feel that way
so heres the deal
call kylie over at the bureau
tell him i got something that might interest him
a guy they call the king pin
i think there may be a corruption case brewing here too
so even if i dont get vig youll still have something to show
rottovich and sobozinski enter
moonan cont d good
i gotta go
hanging up so what do you have for me
we got dick
you guys are not working with me here
i just got off the phone with my boss
after he got done ripping me a new lincoln tunnel size asshole he let me know exactly how little im welcome back if we come up short
and now here you guys are wasting my fucking time
moonan kicks a chair across the floor
like we told you before we think hes into something with the king pin composing himself look im not a confrontational person by nature
moonan walks over to the fallen chair and picks it up
i need answers and the only two things youve given me are jack and shit
you gotta do better
you gotta do better or i swear on my sweet dead grandmothers grave im gonna make you guys an i a fucking d cautionary tale
moonan kicks the chair down again sending rottovich and sobozinski back a few steps
butch takes out two cigarettes and lights both sticking one in jakes mouth
did you know you shouldnt light three cigarettes with a match
jake cont d back in wwi or wwii one of the ww s if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match some nazi would be able
to figure out where you were
it was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had
so three on a match is bad luck
youre a superstitious fucker
lucks a funny thing
especially the bad
having a gun pointed at you for one
its not like breaking a mirror bad luck but its bad
three on a match black cats
believe it all
miles jake lupus and gordo sit around in silence
theyre all dressed in new suits
overlap below but if you wanna talk about bad luck
where the hell is she
just then a knock on the door
jake opens the door to reveal lily dressed in an expensive business suit and sporting a sophisticated cut of new red hair redheads
gordo lupus and miles look up at lily
lily stands at the door watching jake freak out in disbelief
freeze frame on lily and her new red hair
top three all time worst red heads
insert shot a red headed woman enters dark bedroom carrying an axe
insert shot a dinner table for twelve men dressed in flowing robes
a red headed man leans over to whisper in the ear of an important looking guy in the middle
insert shot a red headed woman middle aged with a bad haircut from the s carrying a suitcase leans down and tearfully kisses a small boy on the cheek
the action resumes
nice to see you too
why are you getting so bent
she takes a step into the apartment
you just put a mother of a jinx on us
but the fucking grand poo bah of all jinxes
a bird in your house
lily takes her jacket off revealing a delicate blouse decorated with a design of flowers and a bird
its the scene earlier when jake finds a bird rapping at his window to get out
a bird enters your house
big als bulging vacant eyes stare straight at us his mouth hanging open
it means death
the action resumes
you have no idea what youve done do you
what is this
jake points to her hair
you told me to change my hair
re the shirt what about this
do you have any idea what this means
youve killed us
did i miss something
the red hair
its bad luck
its not like shes a real redhead jake
like that matters
you cant fool bad luck
you cant get by on a technicality
you cant trick karma
lily grabs her jacket and starts out the door then turns back around to jake
so much for that good feeling huh
jake can feel the eyes on him
anybody says a word i swear to god
jake takes off after her
butch cracks a big smile
she had you tempting fate
my father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy
the same numbers everyday for sixteen years
one day he gets pissed off tells them hes out and plays his own numbers
they hit the lucky seven for one point two million
lily steps out from behind butch
guess he passed on that unlucky asshole gene
lily looks down at jake and the gun pointed at his head
theres not even a hint of sympathy
you should have trusted me jake
jake turns and looks at the crew miles gordo lupus and lily behind him
grant ashby sits alone at the crowded bar doing his crossword puzzle
jake a smile and saunters over to the bar
she up for this
shes up for it
ashby sits finishing a drink
snippets of conversation and laughter from the cliques around him catch his attention but he remains alone
is this seat taken
ashby turns to see an attractive blonde pointing to the empty seat next to him
brightening uh no
the blonde grabs the barstool and starts to walk off with it
a rejected look from ashby
sorry im late
lily appears next to the blonde
ashby looks around to make sure shes talking to him
but im not that late
you didnt have to give away my seat
getting it i wasnt sure if youd make it
oh i didnt know you
lily takes the barstool back
the blonde woman leaves as lily sits down next to ashby
thanks for playing along
i just have to sit for a while
they say the streets are lined with money down here but i guess you have to know the secret handshake
what are you drinking
uh makers mark
lily signals the bartender for two more drinks
my names grant
im overbearing and rude
they shake ashbys demeanor brightening again
so what do you do
its more like what arent i doing
my partners and i are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company
we tried the venture capitalist route in the valley but then again who hasnt up there
so brainiacs that we are we thought wed be innovative and relocate east
try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here
the drinks arrive
lily hands the bartender a twenty
i can on me
for the seat
she flashes a trademark smile as they clink glasses
so weve been meeting with banks all day
its amazing how many ways they can say no without ever using the word
well typically corporate loans are relatively simple matters but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery
lily arches an eyebrow at ashby
dont tell me you started a tech firm here before us
nothing like that
i work in a bank
leaning in really
wish we had met eight hours ago
ashby nods and shyly looks away
he could be blushing
lily lets the moment play out for a beat before looking over her shoulder
getting up my partners are here
ashby reverts back to schlub mode
well thanks for the drink
i was just going to ask you if youd like to join us
ashby brightens again
ashby sits with the crew a few empty glasses in front of him
he looks remarkably relaxed just another guy hanging around with a group of friends
she got one leg out from under him
now we had to lean
so then miles walks straight into the creative directors office and says the codes fine the programs for shit and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the
they all break out into laughter
so this is our boss right
he chases me and miles out of his office and hes yelling and screaming youre fired
your whole teams fired
he starts looking for lily lupus gordo but the best part was that he couldnt find gordo
he was in the bathroom
so he finally goes in there kicks in a stall door and starts yelling
and theres gordo pants at the ankles holding a pc world magazine
i havent been able to use a public bathroom since
especially with the thing
lupuss non sequitur brings the whole rhythm of the conversation to a grinding halt
and that was it
thats when we decided to start our own business
no more shithead bosses
i envy you guys
taking a chance like that
masters of our own destiny
so far masters of our own demise
what bank are you with
city bank of manhattan
thats that gillette guy right
off ashbys nod you like him
as a boss i mean
goading come on
what do you do over at your bank grant
what do i do
im the vp of finance
the group exchanges looks
we havent met with anyone your level yet
so that means theres you then the p
heres where a little research comes in handy
corporate banks give out vp titles like calendars
its a small lie but now were sure hes playing
maybe you can help us understand whats so hard about getting a corporate loan
well typically speaking theyre not
as long as you can demonstrate
a capacity for gross fund recovery
yeah we got that part
and tech firms
they tend to scare people off
they scare people off because most people lack vision
vision and balls
present company excluded of course
banks need to know how theyre going to get their money back
we know exactly how were going to make the money back
there in lies the catch i dont follow
an uncomfortable silence falls
grants one of the good guys
she throws ashby a flirty smile
hes our boy
lupus casually punches ashby in the arm
its meant to be a friendly tap but its hard enough to jerk ashbys head to the side
ashby lets out an uncomfortable laugh as he rubs his arm
leaning in listen what im about to tell you im telling you in confidence okay
off ashbys nod have you ever heard of a company called big
that internet thing
the guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the valley do
they get a good idea shop it around raise some capital then sell it off to a bigger company
microsoft intel oracle whatever
the beauty of it is theyve pretty much sold the company before theyre even real
the bigger company is already set to buy it all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works
so they get some start up capital make it work then sell it for like five times the initial loan
sort of like a letter of intent
but the catch is that you cant tell anyone about the offer because if its public you could start a bidding war and thats considered a breach of etiquette
it could kill a deal
but wait too long and youre not considered hot anymore
and you have this letter of intent
thats why i wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little
were getting down to the wire
apparently another company has a similar product in r d right now
if they beat us to it
off the record im this close to cutting someone in on the action if itd help
ashby considers for a moment
should we get another round
jake and lily share an almost imperceptible look
jake lupus miles gordo and lily walking still on a celebratory high
poor bastard never knew what hit him
jesus i almost felt sorry for the guy
i gotta work off some of this adrenaline
i got a line on this pawn shop guy over in brooklyn
anybody want in
i m going home lets go jake
im not going all the way to brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay off
jake looks over at
lily then nods
gordo miles and lupus start to head off
lupus turns and jake moves closer
jake contd when this is all over youre going to tell me who the king put on al
you going to have the time
i find the time
lupus nods and heads off
jake watches them go
look at you
you want to go
a couple hundred bucks
i think youd do it for free
you re almost drooling
you like the rush
its what i do
its my job
your mother not breast feed you or something
are you asking me if i have something to prove
do you have something to prove
not in that repressed anger sort of way
im your basic underachiever
cant stand working and porn doesnt seem like a good option
good quality porn has its place in the world
i get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything
so why this
im good at it
im good at it
its more than that
it doesnt make you yoda
you killed that guy tonight
but i knew you would
so that was my part
smile and shake my ass
you have another part
youll know what to do
how do you know i will
illuminated only by the light coming from the windows
jake runs a hand down the length of lilys bare back
she falls onto him both of them hitting the bed locked in a deep kiss
lilys hand moves down jakes arm until it finds his hand
you have really soft hands
like a babys
remembering the king dont ruin this for me
they roll off the bed onto the floor a naked tangle of arms and legs their hands still entwined
jake takes a deep breath butch and lily behind him
is that what it was jake
was it love
you know when the first con was ever played
it was when adam fell for eve in the garden of eden
lily looks away her face softening for a moment
then she fucked him over with an apple
with a dry laugh redheads
jake continues to laugh
not even the soft morning light can diffuse the reality of this slum pit studio apartment
jake lies next to lily kissing her neck
a spoon rattles in a glass from the growing rumble of a passing subway train
the rumble rises to an almost deafening volume
jakes a little alarmed
drowned out by the rumble how do you deal with yelling yelling back the subway passes deal with that
lily shrugs indifferently
do you think we can do it
jake resumes kissing lilys neck trying to rekindle some of last nights magic
even if we dont youll be alright
youre not in the hole with the king
lily rolls away from jake
undaunted jake starts kissing her back
who says you have to know the king to be in a whole
i actually did have a real job once
when i was in high school i worked as a candy striper
not the way i did it
i was loaded half the time
i dont know how you could change bedpans sober
i used to hang out with this guy glenn
he was an x ray technician or something
you want to talk about an old boyfriend right now
jake kissing up the length of lilys neck
he wasnt my boyfriend
i had a boyfriend at the time
what was his name
anyway glenn was like thirty
i was only fifteen
but he was a nice guy
liked to talk
we used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to morrisey or some stupid shit like that
yeah the sensitive guy thing never worked for me
we were friends
i trusted him
i should have known it was weird
but then again i was weird
you guys got busted
this is a great neck
jake still kissing
no we never got busted
we were done with a shift one night both a couple of percocets down and i was telling glenn about my boyfriend about how we were thinking about doing it
i was thinking about letting him be my first because i loved him
pause what the hell was his name
glenn talked you out of it
i was telling him about this great love of my life whos name i dont remember and i could see
he was getting pissed
i thought it was just because he was worried about me but
lily contd he told me that i was stupid because my boyfriend didnt really love me
jake grabs lily and rolls her over onto her back
he climbs on top of her
he was looking out for you
then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off
pause he said he was going to fuck some sense into me
jake stops kissing lily and looks up at her
shit what was that guys name
i really liked him
after glenn was finished he gave me a couple of valiums and i went home
the next day i finished my shift and met him around back like we always did
i stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest
three or four times
jake slides off lily
did you kill him
i dont know
i packed up my shit and ran away
so unlike you i guess i do have something to prove in a repressed anger sort of way
jake considers for a second
you trusted him
you were just getting square
you know why i told you that jake
turning towards him because i trust you too
jake tries a reassuring smile even though hes not sure its something he should be smiling about
the spoon starts to rattle again as another subway train rumbles in the distance
lily shakes her head in disbelief that jake would tell the story
but i figure if we cant all share at a time like this
butch lowers the gun down and looks over at lily
you got some issues huh
with a hiss i can take care of myself
butch freezes as a police siren wails in the background growing closer then fading again
he puts the gun back to jakes head
ashby sits behind a desk in front of the crew
in front of him are the corporate papers
we had to finalize the deal
everything looks in order
this has to happen fast
it wont go unnoticed
therell be red flags
jake slides an envelope across the desk
you need some convincing
consider it a convincer
ashby leafs through the money in the envelope
lets just slow down for a second
youre worried about recouping the loan
i already told you
no i understand that
what i mean
what im trying to say
i was actually wondering about
well my cut
ecu a bead of sweat rolls down the back of ashbys neck
then there it is
ashby gets the itch
the standard ten
of how much
were going to make it back grant
three or four times over
and all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow
theres a pause before ashby smiles then reaches around to scratch his neck
jake exits ashbys office with lupus gordo miles and lily
they all follow jake down the hallway
youll be there
well use the euc
they pass the glass partitioned conference room
jake looks inside to see morgan gillette holding court with a bunch of suits
butch stands behind gillette
for a second butch and jakes eyes meet
jake lily miles gordo and lupus
as they move through the crowded sidewalk rottovich and sobozinski appear behind them
jake turns just in time to catch rottovichs fist square in the face
jake staggers back and sobozinski pushes him into an alley
that tip not work out for you fellas
tip was fine jake
we were a little more curious about the fed
if you guys dont pay your taxes thats your business
sobozinski punches jake in the stomach
miles and gordo lurch forward pulling his gun back up
you want i should hold him down
gordo throws lupus a look
special agent gunther moonan
ring a bell
i think id remember a gunther
ring it for him sobo
sobozinski punches jake again
i remember now
well hes in town and he sure as shit remembers you
what are we going to do about this jake
we cant afford to have a fed onto us
wouldnt dream of it
rottovich punches jake hard in the stomach sending him gasping to the ground
i dont know what youre into with the king pin but whatever it is we get a piece understand
we get a big piece
if we find out youre keeping us out i may suddenly develope a conscious and give you up to moonan myself
say something stupid if we got a deal jake
gasping for breath something stupid
and dont leave town
to rottovich i always wanted to say that
as the cops exit lily miles and gordo rush to jake
people dont like you much do they
jake lets out a pained groan as they help him up
rottovich and sobozinski get in the front of a squad car
in the back moonan sits reading the travel section of the ny times
did he buy it
i think so
whatd he ever do to you anyway
lets just say he burned me once
moonan calmly turns the page of the paper
whys this guy so hard up for you
youre not exactly a threat to national security
jake sits at a barstool battered and bruised
lily tends to him with a towel
miles and gordo pour drinks
lupus sits at a table watching
we go way back
a mechanical rabbit springs forward
greyhounds bolt out of the gate
about four years ago we were working in miami turf fixing for some local goon
gordo miles big a and jake watch the race with indifference surrounded by excited spectators
turns out this local goon was being watched by the feds which means we were being watched by the feds
one in particular
through the crowd we catch a glimpse of moonan in sunglasses watching the guys
special agent gunther moonan
jake turns and catches moonan looking at him
moonan walks over to a car
he didnt really have anything on us but i figure maybe this guys good for a fix
so i ask him out to dinner
moonan pulls a piece of paper off the windshield that reads la scala night
an elegant restaurant
jake sits confidently in an expensive suit speaking to the shabbily dressed moonan across from him
these guys we have now sure give them twenty bucks and theyll look the other way on a parking ticket
but a fed
you get a guy like that as your fix
jake nonchalantly slides a fat envelope over to moonan
moonan picks it up and finds a wad of cash
it was probably a stupid idea
there i am armani and rolex
there he is jc penny and timex
moonan smiles and slides the envelope back over to jake with a disappointed shake of his head
so i took a shot
but now he had me on attempted bribery of a federal agent
as moonan stands we see big al get up from the next table
a bumps into gordo dressed in a waiters white jacket
gordo trips spilling scalding hot coffee into moonans lap
jake casually gets up and leaves
thats when gordo comes in with the hazelnut french roast
resume moonan falls to the floor holding his crotch in agony
miles pulls up in an old cadillac picking up jake at the entrance
they pick up gordo and big al from a side door and drive off as moonan limps out of the restaurant still holding his crotch
jake finishes the story to lupus
and thats how special agent gunther moonan and i became friends
lupus nods satisfied
we just stay clear of him
jake gets up hard enough to knock the chair over
take it easy
no im not going to take it easy
you cant stay clear of this guy
he will be on this until the end of time
what do we do
we change the scam
there is no scam
ive got a fucking sign on my back
i cant leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money
you get it
jake what do i always tell you guys
dont spend it all
sooner or later were going to run into some bad luck
put it away so when shit like this happens youre not desperate
the gigs up
what are you talking about
we can still do this
jake i mean come on no no no
not this time
i am doing this for your own good
you guys have got to learn when to stop
you with the armani
you with the hookers
do you even remember al
do you remember what he looked like sitting there
you are such a raving pussy sometimes
hey we fucked once honey
that hardly makes you a good judge of character
and dont think i didnt know you were working some angle with that either
everyones working an angle right
there are three people i trust him him and a guy who got killed
i dont know who you are
youre like some stray doq that wandered into the house
so im telling you to cut loose of this
no ones looking for you not the king not moonan and not gillette
just go wherever it is you would go
lily looks around the room
no one seems to be backing her up
what about what
what about the money
jake stops and levels a look at lily
so there it is
you got that big itch you need to scratch
its all about the fucking money
what do you want an apology
no i want my cut
im going to say this one last time for you so take a deep breath and count to ten
there is no cut
lily levels a look of utter contempt at jake
youre an asshole
with that she grabs her coat and leaves
lupus sits quietly taking it all in
so thats it
king aint gonna like this
dont worry ill settle up with your boss
we havent skipped town yet
what im saying is is that the king aint gonna care
see he had a real thing with getting this gillette guy if you ask me i think hes jealous
theyre both crooks
cept this gillette guy
he gets to walk around in three piece suits hob knob with the mayor own a bank that kinda shit
meanwhile the king sits holed up in the steam afraid to even take a leak without me or harlin watching the door
my fucking heart bleeds
that fat guy
the king couldnt wait to have that guy whacked
he didnt even know who the guy was but he was so pissed off at him he gets him drilled
it aint personal
give us a point
point is you dont go through with this hes going to go after you next
and he dont even like you jake
lupus stares blankly at jake
butch hovering over jake
so much for honor among thieves
you would have cut loose your friends your girl
i was doing it for them
you were scared jake
you lost your nerve
you lost your confidence
you werent being noble
you werent trying to save anybody but yourself
its not true
yes it is jake
yes it is
they were right there for you
she was right there for you
look at her
jake doesnt move
butch grabs him by the hair and turns him towards lily
butch contd she trusted you and you sold her out
be a man
tell her jake
tell her that you loved her but the money meant more to you
butch kicks jake in the gut
butch contd grifters
youre just any other lowlife stammer looking out for number one
jake shuts his eyes maybe because butch is right
lupus and jake sit at the table
lupus on the phone
the banks in
its happening tomorrow
lupus turns to jake and slaps him on the shoulder good buddy style
lupus cont d he got a little shaky there for a minute but we got him back in the batters box
the king pin on a cell phone
harlin stands in front of him punching the kings stomach hard enough that hes sweating
the king seems to hardly notice
they got this fed loo king around and the girl just split
is he close
i dont think so
their fix gave us the heads up and jakes got a plan thatll probably keep him off
but this girl the redhead
she knows a lot
she could be a pain in the ass
jake looks up
shes not going to be a problem
lupus cups the phone
he wants to talk to you
whispering dont tell him i said he was jealous of gillette okay
jake reaches over and grabs the phone
jake hangs up the phone
whatd he say
oh you know
dont fuck this up
ill kill you
ill kill your family
ill shoot your dog
all the usual
then he said good luck
a flapping sound catches jake and lupuss attention
a white pigeon sits on the frame of an open window
with a shrug jake continues
we were back on
after you cut her loose
lily pushes butch aside and moves closer to jake
let me tell you a story asshole
lily stands at a hot plate in her kitchen frying an egg
heavy footsteps from the hall catch her attention growing louder then stopping at her door
lily frantically rumages through drawers
she pulls a knife but its only a butter knife
she tosses it aside
lily moves to the door and looks out the peep hole
jake sent me
lily moves to the closet
i just got out of the shower
lily rumages in the closet and a baseball bat
she hefts the bat and takes a stance in front of the door
lily slowly reaches for the doorknob
then the door flies open with a crash
harlin fills the doorway
the king would like to have a word with you
lily wide eyed stands frozen with the bat still cocked
uh right now
i have a car waiting
lily takes a swing
harlin easily grabs the bat and backhands lily
she goes flying back into the far wall bounces off and lands with a thud at harlins feet where she finds the butter knife
harlin reaches down and pulls lily up by the hair
the egg sizzles in the pan
lily takes a stab at harlin but the knife just bounces off his coat
harlin slaps lily again sending her flying into the stove
smoke starts to rise from the burning egg
harlin steps closer but lily throws her hands up in surrender
a spoon rattles in a cup as the rumble of a subway train grows louder
drowned out by rumble i apologize for the yelling yelling back
lily shakes her head and points to her ear and mouths cant hear you
harlin moves closer and they lean into each other
harlin cont d louder the subway passes the door
nodding no problem
she grabs the smoking pan from the stove and whacks harlin across the head
the burned egg lands on the floor
lily watches as he sways and teeters on his feet like a drunk
she raises the pan again
but before she delivers the final blow harlin steps on the egg causing his leg to shoot out from under him
he lands flat on his back out cold
the wood floor creaks with his weight
lily wipes the blood from her nose and turns the hot plate off
jake butch and lily
i didnt know
your friend big al
it should have been you
what happened today
started off great
crystal blue water gently rolls onto virgin white sand
a jet cuts a line across the cloudless sky
ashby was going to call us with the exact time of the transfer
the king was waiting on us
just to be safe
gordo sits in first class impeccably dressed in a brooks brothers suit
gordo went down to the caymens instead of me
i needed rottovich and sobozinski to keep moonan off our backs and the only way i could do that was to stay in town and cut them in on the
rottovich and sobozinski sit around the desks as moonan reads the newpaper behind them
so they waited for my call while miles and i waited for ashbys call
jake sits with miles and lupus at a table in the otherwise empty bar
he should be landing in the caymens about now
the customs guy is ready right
jake stares off into space absentmindedly flipping a penny in his hand
feeling lucky today miles
found a penny heads up
there was an empty cab right outside my building
we hit every green light
and we got rid of the red head
and we got rid of the red head
jake just nods and continues flipping the penny
jake they say a good chess player can
see up to twenty moves deep
that means that in some games youve calculated every possible move in your head
the games over before its even really started
ashby sits at a desk computer terminal in front of him
he speaks in hushed tones on the phone
same thing with playing a con
you have to be able to see that deep
yeah its going through insert shot ecu of ashbys finger on the enter key
ashby coat d now
ashby hangs up and checks over his shoulder
jake hangs up and immediately dials another number
in order to ensure that we werent going to welch ashbys pay off was to be directly deposited into his own offshore account which he could confirm electronically
in this age of ecommerce paper currency has become more of a liability than a commodity
especially to us
into phone go
gordo listens into a cell phone without saying a word he gets up wheeling a nondescript black suitcase
across the street sits the grand caymens bank in all its pastel and brass glory
gordo moves across the lobby of the bank to the back of a line at the teller windows wheeling the black suitcase
gordo was making the withdrawal from the grand laymens bank
gordo stands in front of a teller
she reads off a paper then does a double take at gordo who smiles back
they check the papers
gordo slides a folder of corporate papers along with his photo id towards the teller
we follow the teller as she hands the papers to the angle on the teller window a check is pushed to gordo
gordo shakes the loan officers hand and calmly walks towards the door
gordo walks across the street with the suitcase and pulls a cell phone from his pocket
first and ten
gordo hangs up without another word
he approaches a building with the words bank of the caymens engraved over the brass handled doors
gordo approaches the teller window with the check in hand
then he had to bang it out across the street at the bank of the caymens
id like this cashed please
another teller looks at the check then back up at gordo
gordo contd i also need to deduct a certain amount and deposit it into this account number
gordo takes another piece of paper and slides it to the teller
ashby sits nervously tapping his computer monitor with a pen
marie a secretary pokes her head in
thompson from international with a r on a corporate account
ashby watches the screen as a big broad smile comes across his face
probably just a new account marker
standing tell him i already left for lunch and that ill call him later
ashby grabs his coat and strides confidently out
a security guard stands in the small windowless room
gordo is escorted into the room by a bank official
well let you have a moment
on a small table are neat piles of bundled money shrink wrapped in plastic
gordo seems in awe
we called them green twinkies
the bank official and security guard exit
gordo holds up a green twinkie up to his nose and takes a deep breath
the security guard holds open the door as gordo exits suitcase in tow
gordo takes his cell phone out as he moves across the street
we got twinkies
gordo pockets the phone and disappears into the crowd
jake hangs up the phone and dials another number
he nods at lupus
miles was on his way to the airport to wait for gordo to land
i made the call
yeah its me
i need an escort
not a ride just an escort
you wanted in this is in
sobozinski behind a desk
sitting in a chair leafing through a magazine is moonan
rottovich on the phone
gordo with a black suitcase
you got moonan under control
dont worry about moonan
we got him covered
hanging up it was him
theres a shipment coming through tonight
shipment of what
off rottovichs shrug find two cars
and change into plain clothes
after rottovich and sobozinski exit moonan dials a number
jake sits at the bar looking at his watch
he notices his hand is shaking
so thats it huh
you get the cops to give you a safe ride
let me ask you something
you really think im going to come this close this fucking close and let my guard down
ill get square with your boss
ill get square with whoever did al
ill get square with everybody
then im going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here
youre a weasal
lupus gets off the stool and we follow him into
lupus enters the small
bathroom and pulls a cellphone
hes landing with the money at kennedy in a few hours
you were right
hes trying to fuck you
you want it you gotta get it at the airport
the king pin closes the cell phone and looks over at harlin whos hair is singed and matted down on one side
hes got pigs for an escort
you believe this guy
ill get the car
the king struggles into a pair of pants then turns around
king pin cont d my ass look big in this
harlin deliberately looks away
looks fine boss
a black lincoln town car rolls through the parking lot
behind the wheel we see harlin with the king pin riding in the back
the town car passes
we follow the town car as it passes
the town car finally parks in the same row each car separated only by a few spaces
sobozinski and rottovich overlook the terminal
you trust this moonan guy
i dont trust anybody
you see how bad this guy wants vig
its like a sickness
i say we collar vig ourselves
we got vig then we got leverage
and we trade vig for that tape
i want to see it right in front of my face
its just insurance
thats what im talking about
sobozinski holds his hand up for a high five
what are you doing
put your hand down
i dont high five
theres the crackle from a walkie talkie
you guys awake
into walkie were here
moonan sits a safe distance away from an area marked customs
behind a large table a few customs officers in white shirts mill around
moonan speaks into a mic hidden in his sleeve
moonan keeps his eyes on the customs desk
gordo sits squashed in the window seat next to a very oh jeez
heavyset quickly gets up
jake sits at the bar the phone a few inches away
lupus pours himself a drink from the bar
the phone rings
gordo on the air phone next to mrs
im landing in about fifteen minutes
heavyset returns to his seat drying his hands on his own shirt
i tell ya this airline food goes right through me every time
heavyset pats her husbands hand
you ever use the bathroom in kennedy
use the bathroom on the plane
gordo eyes mr
let me just say that there is no way im using the bathroom on this plane
jake hangs up
hes wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom
you believe this
maybe hes got it right
maybe were all just looking for a safe place to shit
that was fucking deep
lupus gets up and heads for the bathroom again
a cell phone rings with a digitized version of ode to joy
the king answers it
hes got a suitcase on wheels
so do half the other people in this place
how do i know which one
i got it figured out
hes got this thing with bathrooms
if he makes it through customs hell be heading for the john
do not let vig out of your sight
the king hangs up the phone and motions to harlin to go
jake looks up at a small digital clock sitting behind the bar
it reads pm
lupus emerges from the back hallway to find jake dialing a number
whats up with you
keep it up
you got my cell
leave a message
gordos landing right now
meet me at the euclid
for your cut i mean
i want you to have it
jake hangs up the phone
you really like that bitch dont you
i gotta tell you i was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut
you know how it is get her to do some shit for you throw her a bang to keep her happy
but if youre into her
thats what i like about you lupus
youre a free thinker
dont let the king tell you different
not for nothing jake but the guy who whacked your buddy
it was me
the king usually farms out for that kind of stuff but i tell ya he was so pissed off he couldnt wait for the regular guy
fucker didnt even put down his kung pao chicken
jake seems to be reeling with the information
egg foo young
standing stand up
laughing no offense but ive seen you fight
you gotta be kidding m jakes sends a fist flying right into lupus mouth knocking him over
i said stand up
morgan gillette sits behind a desk in an ultra modern office his reptilian like face fixed straight ahead
butch leans against the wall behind him
this is probably about where you came in
now thats an exciting story
butch has anyone ever tried something like this before
not that i recall
what do you want us to do about it
lets suppose he gets to customs and he gets caught
we get our money back but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation
i dont much like that idea
then again lets suppose he actually gets through customs
now thatll be something
we recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud
we double our money
so we go to the bar
i think so
the airports going to be crawling with police
traffic will be a nightmare
go down to the bar
if they pull it off great
have someone deal with ashby
well take care of it
and how much did you say you wanted for this
what did you call it
a finders fee
reveal lily sitting on the couch in front of them cell phone in hand
that seems a little high
ten is standard sir
but only if we recover the cash
i want something for this
have a little faith in him honey
butch see if you can get him to tell you how he did it
or almost did it
sounds like a good story
i ll ask
gillette picks up an apple from a bowl in his desk
the oldest con
we follow gordo as he wheels the black suitcase down the long corridor towards the customs desk
moonan spots gordo and speaks into his wrist
i got him
a few travelers quickly move past the desk
gordo approaches a customs officer
gordo lays the suitcase on the desk the customs officer looks nervously in both directions before waving gordo through
moonan follows at a safe distance as gordo clears customs
rottovich and sobozinski check their guns
hes headed towards the eastern most exit
do not under any circumstances approach
i want to follow this all the way down to vig
into walkie roger that
oh yeah well wait jerk off
sobozinski snorts a laugh as they get out of the car
gordo wheels the suitcase towards the exit when he spots the mens room
he stops and considers for a moment before he turns and enters
moonan watches a few yards back
he pulls his badge out from under his shirt hanging from a chain
into mic he just went into the crapper
hold your positions
harlin walks into the mens room half a minute after gordo
gordo pads the toilet with half the roll before gingerly setting his ass down
suddenly the stall door flies open
harlin steps in gordo defenseless with his pants at his ankles
harlin picks him up off the toilet and throws him into the wall repeatedly before letting him fall face first onto the dirty floor
moonan watches the door to the mens room as harlin comes out wheeling the black suitcase behind him
into mic they pulled a switch
keep on him
rottovich turns the walkie talkie off as he and sobozinski fall in behind harlin
angle on miles who steps out of his car watching the little parade go by with a look of confusion
a loud thumping noise
jake has lupus by the hair as he rams his head repeatedly into the bar
jake then gets him into a headlock
lupus snaps his head back and butts jake in the nose sending him staggering back
moonan taps the mic hidden in his sleeve then checks the walkie
can you hear me
moonan pulls the ear plug out and races down the hall
harlin gets to the king pins car and opens the back door
as he crams the suitcase in rottovich and sobozinski come up behind him guns drawn
they both grin like idiots
jake goes flying into the bar
lupus pushed jake back up against the bar and lands a series of body blows
jake manages to grab the phone and whips it across lupus head sending him to the ground
jake straddles lupus and raises the phone for the last whack
we hear a loud click
jake stops and the two slowly get up
as they stand we can see that lupus has the barrel of a small gun in jakes mouth
jake shuts his eyes tight still holding the phone
which just then rings
jake opens his eyes and looks at the phone
then to lupus who nods
jake picks up the receiver and speaks the gun still in his mouth
miles on a cell phone
i dont know whats going on
the king pin
hes here and he just got pinched
i think with the twinkies
it looks like half the police departments down here
in the background a whirlwind of activity red and blue flashing lights half of the police department federal agents in blue windbreakers
the king and harlin slumped over the hood of the car cuffed
jake drops the phone and looks at lupus
w the gun still in his mouth eee oott auught
pulling the gun out sorry
he got caught
your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched
lupus picks up the phone and dials another number
lupus cocks the gun and crams it back into jakes mouth
lupus takes a newspaper off the bar and covers jakes face with it
blood splatters across the front page of the metro section
the paper falls away revealing jake wide eyed the gun hanging from his mouth
lupus lies in a heap at the floor
jake lets the gun fall and looks up to see butch standing at the door gun in hand
lily steps out from behind him
i never thanked you for that
jake runs his tongue across the front of his teeth
can we please all stop being so goddamnfucking polite and get to the point
wheres the money jake
butch presses the gun against jakes head
jake turns and looks at lily
they lock eyes
what do you get lily
because it is all about the money right
you sold me out
you should have trusted me like i trusted you
you fucked up
you fucked up huge
butch taps jake on the head with the gun
she doesnt get shit unless i get that money
where is it
probably safe in the hands of the federal government
butch buttons his coat
you disappoint me
and you just let lily here down again
butch contd what was it you said about playing the big con
its like putting on a play where everyone knows their part except for the mark
like putting on a play
guess some people forgot their lines
so why dont you take a deep breath jake and ill count to ten
as butch continues to count jake slowly turns his head and looks at lily
butch still counting smiles at lilys obvious contempt then slides the gun along the back of jakes head
i do trust you lily
butch turns back to lily to see her reaching into her bag
wha butch spins and aims at her
lily pulls out a gun and
gordo stirs on the floor of the stall slowly getting up
pieces of toilet paper are stuck to his face
miles gets back in the car and screeches out of his parking space
it should be a four letter word
lily drops the gun and breaks down in tears jesus christ
tell me before you do something like that
jake lies face down in a puddle the collected pool of water growing red with blood
police sirens wail in the distance growing closer
you should leave
butch disappears down the dark alley
lily stands for a moment and takes a final look at jakes body
she then turns and runs back into the bar
so im dead
police officers and federal agents in windbreakers swarm all over the parking lot
the king and harlin are bent over the hood of the car cuffed
one federal agent pulls the black suitcase out of the car
but maybe i cant blame lily
maybe i just should have just trusted her to play her part
because playing the big con is like putting on a play
a play where everyone knows their part except for the mark
jake sits with lily miles and gordo crammed into a booth
just watch everything you say around him
every word every move
it all goes back to the king pin
lily with her new red hair and the bird blouse
the crew watches jake slowly flip out
you have no idea what youve done do you
what is this
jake points to her hair
lupus quietly watches taking it all in
jake and lily squaring off
you tell them the tale
what do you want
no i want my cut
lupus watches quietly taking it all in
lupus on the cellphone to the king
and like in a game of chess youve played every possible move in your head
you were right
hes trying to fuck you
you want it you gotta get it at the airport
police officers and federal agents in windbreakers swarm around the king pins car
then you give them the blow off
you get them off your back
the king pin and harlin are bent over the hood handcuffed
rottovich and sobozinski lie on the ground face down their hands behind their heads
were on the job
were active in the one six
next to them a federal agent opens the suitcase
coffee beans spill out on the asphalt followed by the two bricks of heroin
the two internal affairs officers from before emerge from the crowd
officers rottovich and sobozinski
the second internal affairs officer holds up a fuck me
jake slides a thick envelope of money to moonan seated across from him
but most of all you need the fix
this time moonan takes it
jake finishing the moonan story
thats how special agent gunther moonan and i became friends
lupus nods satisfied
gordo hoists the suitcase onto the desk
the customs officer looks around nervously
we see hes looking at moonan in the b
who gives him a nod
like suits said sooner or later someones going to start asking the right questions
the custom officer waves gordo through
gordo reaches down and picks up an identical black suitcase already lying on the table next to his and leaves
rottovich and sobozinski would ask how the drugs got in that suitcase
the king and gillette would ask where the money really went
moonan walks over to the customs desk and takes the original black suitcase
he nods to the customs officer
moonan turns and walks towards camera wheeling the suitcase behind him
and all of them would ask what agency special agent gunther moonan worked for
we close in on the badge hanging from moonans neck
on it is a number and the single word customs
but what do i care
a thin white vest splattered with blood and wired with squibs falls to the ground
police sirens wail just around the corner
jake emerges from
the back alley his shirt ripped and splattered with fake blood
no ones going to ask me a black car comes to a stop n front of him
the tinted glass slides down and jake leans in
inside we see moonan and lily riding in the back miles and gordo up front
she smiles that smile
jake gets in and the car pulls away followed seconds later by two police cars screeching to a stop in front of the euclid
