written by nick guthe the face of minerva mini drogues watching something
she looks extremely bored by the television images flickering across her eyes
she has a pretty face large eyes and pouty mouth
her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly still that of a girl
i know what youre thinking
dont bullshit me because i do
youre thinking oh dear lord in heaven please im begging you
ill gouge out my eyes with the straw in my drink right now
ill jam every last kernel of popcorn into my mouth until i suffocate just not another fucking teenage coming of age story
we pull back to reveal her body which is moving out of that awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood
though tall and thin her hips havent quite rounded
shes wearing a fuct t shirt and jean shorts
no prom night highjinks no nerds becoming popular and no shakespeare set in high school
close on the tv screen
when animals attack is on
in a series of quick cuts a zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant
a sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a shark he and his buddies thought was dead
a pit bull clamps down on his owners arm
an alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a just captured alligator only to have it chomp down on his skull
since it happened everyones asked me how it all started
minis face registers no reaction to the gruesome images
we now see she is sitting in the living room of a well appointed studio city hillside home
teenagers of privilege and their uptight parents are milling around dancing and chatting as a deejay spins tunes
i suppose the obvious answer is my eighteenth birthday
mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini skirt and halter top
she clearly understands how to the drive the boys crazy and this is not lost on her mother diane who stands off to the side nursing a drink with some
other hyper see i was blessed with a terrific mom
not only is she a lush but she also hates me
diane is beautiful but there is an essential hardness to her that comes from a life spent trading on her looks
the blouse and mini skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing for the occasion of her daughters birthday
a few days before the party i overhear her on the phone ordering me a male stripper
nothing says i love you like ten inches of man meat in your face
diane and the other mothers are talking about minis dancing
and knowing dear old ma shell try and nail him after the party
in my bed
minis friend kayla a little rounder but also brash comes dancing over
shes swaying her hips provocatively at mini almost challenging her
mike rudell a tanned and trim man of watches their display clearly enjoying the way its jump starting his imagination
our neighbor mike rudell big shot tv producer and the guy my mom screws whenever the batteries run out
kayla and mini begin dancing together in a very explicit way clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable
yo bee ach
yo birthday bee ach
is it on
oh its on
thats my girl
mini grabs kayla and dips her low
kayla instructs some caterers to start wheeling a giant birthday cake into the living room
the caterers look confused but kayla is insistent and the young men obey starting to wheel the cake down the long hall
the cake emerges from the hallway
the caterers begin singing happy birthday as diane turns to see it and her eyes flash rage
as diane comes storming over we switch to slow motion
see to understand me you need to understand that life in my opinion is all about new experiences
firsts is what i call them
as she strides across the room the look of vitriolic rage on dianes face grows stronger with every step
somewhere around fourteen when i had my first
rhymes with duck i realized that the goal of life any life should be to cram as many firsts into it as possible
we switch back to real time
what the hell are you doing
i said wait until looking around shes not even here you morons
a young caterers face turns white
but but her friend said pop
suddenly the lid to the cake flies off and from behind we see a nude mini rises out of it like venus on the half shell
a collection of reactions from the party goers the mothers are numb the fathers pretend to be disturbed while copping looks and her friends are in stitches
some are even waving dollar bills
m that was definitely a first but more importantly it was the first time i really understood my potential
and thats when it all started
mini leans over and gives her stunned mom a big hug
doing her best donna reed oh mom this is the best birthday ever
mini stands in a bathrobe with a towel around her head having just taken a shower
she removes the towel to reveal shes just changed her hair color to flaming red
that little stunt got me grounded for a week but it was worth it
mini blow drying her hair
see i just dont understand people who live their lives as one big routine
mini evenly spreading the base to her make up
theyre basically saying im not worthy of a unique experience on this earth
well sorry but i am
mini applying blush to her cheeks
the law of firsts has served me well because its liberated me from the usual pathetic repetitive concerns of high school
mini applying eye liner
i simply dont care if im popular because if i did then id be constantly stressing about whether my clothes are cool enough or if troy the gay but he
doesnt know it yet quarterback is gonna call
mini and kayla walk down the crowded halls attracting lustful looks from some of the more aggressive boys
they approach a group of football players
whispering worried oh god its troy
just keep walking and dont look at him
roy a cocky chiseled all around nightmare sticks his tongue in his cheek simulating a blow job
yo kayla i got some more of what you were looking for saturday night
the joys of the american educational system
kayla puts her head down her face turning red as mini stops to address troy and his posse
suddenly brightening actually troy i think you confused her with that senile toothless grandmother of yours
ooohs and aaahs erupt from the onlookers as troy looks concerned his ambush has backfired
yo mini why dont you use that mouth for something useful and suck my dick
more students start to gather overhearing them
actually now that you mention it i cant think of anything id rather do than suck your dick
troy looks around surprised and emboldened by her declaration
well its all for you babe
mini moves closer looking him right in the eye
daring her if you can fit it all in
the crowd has now swelled to a few dozen as everyone is riveted by the exchange
suddenly mini starts unzipping his fly
hey what the
grabbing his belt buckle im going to suck your dick troy you said i could
troy tries to push her away but shes got a grip on his belt
everyone watching is almost speechless at first but then giggles start to erupt
yo this aint funny
no troy i want to suck your dick right now
jesus mini come on get off
screaming no troy
you said i could now come on
she gets down on her knees struggling to get a hand in his pants
the crowd howls with approval as they almost cant believe their eyes
lets see it
come on i want to suck your throbbing member right now
troy finally pushes her off humiliated and runs down the hall as the mob laughs at him
kayla looks at her gratefully and smiles
mini applying frosty hot pink lipstick making her lips as full as possible
mini looks towards the door deciding to ignore her mother
screaming mini turns towards the sound
diane comes storming in
when i call you i expect you to answer
dont patronize me
sugar sweet sorry
if youre trying to get me to call you a spoiled little ungrateful bitch youre out of luck because i wont give you the satisfaction
dianes eyes narrow as its clear mini knows exactly where her mothers buttons are
what do you want
im going out and i need you to wait for the delivery from the liquor store
theyll be here by nine
diane gives mini the once over lingering on her mini skirt
diane winces at the outfit
just thought you should know that makes your thighs look fat
deadpan gosh youre right mom im such a cow
its a freakin miracle im not anorexic after eighteen years of her little pep talks
have fun dont do anything i wouldnt
diane turns and leaves
over her shoulder well that doesnt leave much
under her breath cunt
mini turns back to the mirror
mini pulls on a pair of thigh high stockings as a lit cigarette hangs from m her mouth
my mother moved out to la from ohio when she was twenty to become an actress
even though she was a total flatliner somehow she managed to land a few bit parts on soaps
without screwing anyone
mini walks along the corridor in a pair of fuck me pumps as the doorbell is heard ringing
when she gets really sauced shell pop the tapes in and make me watch then ill threaten to call the suicide hotline
she continues through the living room towards the door hiking her mini skirt up a little
after a few years she got desperate and spread em for this fat ugly producer when he promised to give her a role in some bullshit cable series that was
basically softcore porn
she got knocked up with me and he told her she couldnt be on the show unless she hoovered me out
she reaches the front the door
excuse me for one sec
she opens the door to reveal a delivery boy jimmy s with six cases of liquor stacked on a handcart
nervously excited hey mini how you doin
mini watches as jimmy carefully lifts one case after another on to the counter
she was gonna do it too at least that whats she told me when she was feeling particularly loving
but then she heard rumors the show wasnt gonna fly and realized eighteen years of child support beat thirteen weeks on skin tight so i got to stick around
mini opens one case takes out a bottle and heads out of the kitchen
mini mixes herself a large sapphire martini
anyway what mom didnt count on was the prick having a heart attack and croaking a year after i was born
she pours it into a martini glass and drops an olive in
when she tried to collect on his estate she found out hed owed the government two point five in back taxes
diane walks down the steps to a waiting porsche with a sleazy looking but clearly rich guy behind the wheel
now if she had been smart she wouldve set her sights a little lower and gone after a guy who wouldve worshipped the ground she walked on and wouldnt care
that she already had a kid
diane getting into the car
she turns to the driver and gives him a flirty smile
its now a different but just as sleazy guy smiling back at her
but not mom she was gonna bag another elephant if it meant gobbling every knob from hollywood to the palisades
as the car pulls away we see an year old mini watch from an upstairs window of the building
mini sits watching tv as diane walks in with yet another sleazy guy his hands all over her
diane looks surprised and pissed to see mini still up
jesus chr mini why arent you in bed
mini just stares at her then shifts her penetrating gaze to sleazy guy
he looks unnerved by mini
i thought you said wed be dont worry larry shes going to bed right now
mini lies awake as the sounds of diane fucking sleazy guy s brains out waft through the thin walls
mini sits at the kitchen table eating cereal as the fourth sleazy guy emerges from dianes bedroom hes tucking his shirt in
he looks a little startled to see her up
uh hi uh tell your mom i uh had a good time
oh i will
like some coffee for the road
the guy looks at her a little surprised then smiles
mini watching the porsche pull away from the curb
in her hand she holds a bottle of maximum strength ex lax
sleazy guy driving down the freeway drinking coffee from a paper cup
suddenly a look of absolute dread overcomes him
diane emerges from her bedroom in her bathrobe looking disheveled
she glares at mini who sits at the kitchen table eating her cereal
do you want to live in this shit hole your whole life
mini just stares at her
then stay in your fucking room until they leave
mini says nothing
suddenly diane picks up a small piece of pottery from the coffee table and throws it at minis head
mini ducks as it smashes behind her on the wall
so it pretty much went on like that until
five years ago when she met martin
mini starts downing the drink in a few big gulps
it was a win win
mini diane and martin tannen a trim executive in an armani suit and haircut mingle at a large corporate cocktail party
martin a man who understands in his world style over substance is a way of life works the crowd effortlessly
he didnt want kids but needed a ready made family to help project an image of stability for his corporate outings
we finally got out of reseda
mini at the bar stealing the drink of a trophy wife who has turned her back on it to make a point to her older husband
it was great for about a year
martin finishes talking to a client and heads out on the balcony to get some air where he sees diane kissing a handsome young executive off to the side
martin stiffens as he watches in slow motion her tongue slip into his mouth
then he figured out what he had married
by then it was too late
martin puts his keys and cell phone on a table near the door
breezing past him youre home early
first time in three months hes walked in before letterman
he totally forgot my birthday party and right now im thinking his pin cushion must have given him the walking papers or
found a new pin
searching a dinner with a client got canceled
about the same
they head back into the living room
protecting all those poor defenseless oil companies from those big bad environmentalists
someones got to make the payments on your beemer
hes a partner at a public relations firm which is ironic because i cant remember the last time he and my mom were seen in public together
or had relations
he plops down on the couch taking an electronic organizer out of his breast pocket
is your mother around
no she went to a party off beachwood
she was in one of her happy moods so i doubt shell be sleeping here
innocently if you were thinking of inviting a guest over
measured i wasnt but thanks for the concern
youre going out on a school night
martin punches a few buttons on the organizer his mind clearly elsewhere
is your homework done
havent even cracked a book
not listening mmm
mini double checks her purse for everything lipstick compact altoids a flask of liquor and a string of condoms
considering how many guys my mom has done in his bed youve got to admire his resolve
he couldve left her years ago but with no pre nup he loses half and he just wont give in
mini walks out the front door revealing an impressive front of the house with stone pillars and a brick circular drive
martins mercedes sl coupe and minis bmw z convertible sit in the open garage
their arrangement actually keeps everything very calm
mini gets into her bmw
the bmw drives down the street weaving in and out of traffic
m as i said the rule of firsts guides my life
once youve gotten into every club in town and had enough ivy league lawyers cum too fast drastic measures are called for
mini walks past the neon covered shop windows
i thought it would be a goof if i put a photo ad in one of those cent outcall massage newspapers they sell around town
but i just got a bunch of pervs breathing heavy on my voice mail
so i went to an escort service and when they found out i was they told me they had two tricks in the same hotel that night
if i was up to it
she passes older prostitutes soliciting cars that have slowed down for a peek
would you look at them
one of the prostitutes gives her a threatening look
i mean shes got to be what
at least twenty eight
in dog years
pausing oh wait that would make her four
she arrives in front of the hollywood roosevelt hotel
mini walks down a hall and stops in front of a room and knocks
she looks around trepidatiously as she waits for an answer
the door opens and a middle aged man opens the door
hes very well groomed in a creepy middle american way
he could be a serial killer or
mini pulls her red top on and heads for the door as the man sheepishly follows her
my first night as a call girl was a serious let down
it turns out both guys were in town for the promise keepers convention
she reaches the door
he opens it and points to the room across from his
mini walks across and knocks
the first one got so excited i didnt even get a chance to get my panties off before he creamed himself
a heavier man in a denim shirt opens it
the heavier man is on his knees weeping as he hugs mini around the waist
and the other said i looked so much like his niece he started whimpering and praying for forgiveness
she rolls her eyes in frustration
mini drives home suddenly a siren is heard and she sees the flashing lights of a cop car behind her
mini pulls over looking pissed
time to bat the eye lashes
the cop car pulls up behind her and a female cop with a buzz cut gets out approaching the car
mini looks in her mirror with a sly smile
the cop reaches minis door and looks down at her clearly attracted to her
the police cruiser is parked with its lights off
the female cop is lying on the seat with her legs spread as mini goes down on her
the woman is clutching the steering wheel with her left hand and the seat with her right hanging on for dear life as mini rocks her world
are you kidding
my first woman and my first cop
it wouldve been perfect if she hadnt wanted to cuddle afterwards
mini unlocks the door and walks in to find diane passed out face up on the sofa in a loosely tied bathrobe
at the sound of the door diane looks up
wha what are you doing here
ini stops and looks at her mother absorbing her insightful question
mini sighs and heads for the bedroom
did you have fun dear
yeah i turned two tricks and went down on a dyke cop
mini heads down the hallway
god whats gotten into her
she was almost warm and fuzzy
mini walks in and stops dead in her tracks
a greasy haired naked man lies passed out on her bed
his body hair is thick and matted
his genitals are covered by her pillow which he cradles like a teddy bear
minis jaw tightens slowly
mini walks through the lobby past two businessmen sitting at the bar chatting up two very attractive women in their mid twenties
after that night things really picked up
the mens eyes instinctively follow mini as their dates exchange a glance of annoyance
my one rule which the agency wasnt too happy about was of course only firsts no repeat customers
this time mini walks in dressed like a normal high school student past a security guard
but believe me they didnt have too much trouble honoring that request
mini is led in by a secretary who presents mini to one of the peninsula businessmen sitting behind a large oak desk
id make house calls to offices at lunch hour and wed say i was someones niece or cousin in town on vacation
the man stands up and greets her like shes family and then quickly shuts the door
mini arrives in her convertible and gets out dressed in a cheerleaders uniform
and then when football season started saturday through monday
a husky man in a football jersey opens the door to find mini waving her pom poms with a texas sized grin on her face
i was busier than dominos
mini drives into the garage
then one thursday night i get a a last minute gig at a fuck pad in westwood that some executive keeps so wifey doesnt find the motel bills on the
gold card statements
they say im just his type
mini walks quickly through the lobby
they tell me hes not big on the chit chat and he loves paying extra for the stuff we charge extra for
mini knocks on the door
the executive convenience apartment is cold sterile and clearly just used for short amounts of time
mini opens the door passing the closet the bathroom door and then stops suddenly as she sees
martin her stepfather sitting up in bed
she quickly turns away before he sees her face
can you fucking believe it
mini goes back towards the front door panicking
she absently hangs her jacket up in the closet to buy some time
hi quickly adopting a southern accent sorry im mlate
dont worry about it
mind if i freshen up
mini ducks into the bathroom
mini shuts the door turns on the light and looks at herself in the mirror
shes almost white from the shock
she looks down at the counter
my own dad
my first thought was how sick is he
but then i started thinking
im one to talk and
minis expression softens as she examines herself closer
i mean he isnt my real dad
and talk about a first
the more i thought about it
a wicked glint dances across her eyes
the more turned on i got
then i thought that if my mother could do some strange guy in my bed i could do her strange guy in this bed
everything alright in there
still in her southern accent just peachy
listen sugar would you mind turning the lights off im kinda new to all this and a little shy
no thats fine but can we get this show on the road
sure can in two shakes of a lambs tail
martin turns the light off next to the bed
a little bit of light from the street sneaks in around the edges of the blinds
after a second the door opens and mini comes out in a bra and panties
mini crosses the room slowly and sits on the edge of the bed letting her hair fall over her face
martin tries to pull her hair away from her eyes but she turns away playfully shaking her head no
she reaches down and touches him through the sheet
he looks up at her clearly excited but she keeps her gaze down
he reaches over to the nightstand and picks up his wallet
what did you have in mind tonight
oh so you want complete access
voice quivering y
you do know thats extra
just so were clear
now close your eyes
martin furrows his brow disappointed
now just keep them shut for a while
mini pulls the sheet back revealing his body to her
she starts kissing his chest inhaling deeply
she looks up at his expectant face intoxicated with her power
her mouth starts to move down his chest
martin lets out a small almost self conscious gasp
it is still dark as martin and mini lie under the sheets post coitus in the spoons position
martin has a dreamy satisfied look on his face
mini smiles to herself
i cant believe i pulled that off
keeping my face hidden actually wasnt that hard and he pretty much let me do whatever i wanted
mini is getting dressed
and you know what
he was damn good
i dont why mom is throwing the cat all over town when she can have this every night
the room still dark mini emerges from the bathroom dressed
searching that was
you were really good
southern accent thanks sugar
id like to see you again but
i never got your name
even in the dark he looks a little embarrassed
ginger i wont forget
mini walks to her car giddy with excitement
i literally couldnt feel the ground under my feet
a first to top all firsts
i knew id tell him one day but i wanted to savor it for a while
she reaches her car and looks for her keys in her purse
her eyebrows furrow as she has trouble finding them
suddenly she realizes they arent there
you forgot your
startled her head whips around to see martin walking towards her carrying her jacket
he stops the realization setting in
seconds go by as mini allows a pathologically triumphant smile to spread across her mouth
heres to immediate gratification
martin starts to look nauseous as mini walks slowly over and gives him a deep wet kiss right on the mouth
whispering you were great
martin just stares straight ahead numb
after another moment he walks to the railing of the garage staring down at the street below
martins pov a few cars rush by on the street below
it appears to be about a three or four story drop
he looks back at mini
he starts to lift a leg over the railing
uh that fall probably wont kill you and considering what a caring nurturer your wife is i dont think thats a risk you can afford to take
martin looks down at the street for another moment
god what a drama queen
dont let this little act fool you
hed never let mom get all his money
he glances back at her looking tortured
this is just his twisted public relations brain working overtime to figure what the appropriate response should be to fucking your stepdaughter
artin backs away from the railing
now thats thinking outside the box
martin and mini sit at a booth
martin stirs his coffee looking shell shocked
mini devours a plate of belgian waffles covered with whipped cream
we spent the next few hours just sitting there
i dont think we said three words
i think he was trying to find a way to justify the whole thing but it was actually one of the sweetest nights i ever spent with a guy
mini drives home with the top down
he told me it was a monumental mistake and that we should both never mention it again
i told him that was fine
mini sits at the table eating cereal
martin enters looking a little guilty as they exchange an awkward glance
suddenly he started coming home every night and even started really asking me about my homework
morning kiddo you finish those math problems
mini looks up at him raising her eyebrows
id be happy to help you with it if you need
actually im thinking about starting a k plan at work could you help me pick a good mutual fund
martin looks down uncomfortably
martin watches television next to diane whos passed out with an empty bottle of vodka sitting on the coffee table
a bottle of prescription medication is open as well
martin looks over at diane pokes her to make sure shes truly blitzed checks his watch and stands up
mini lies in bed under the covers reading
the door to her room opens
she looks at the clock
it reads am
it took exactly one week
the lights are off and the two of them are going at it under the covers
in the beginning i was concerned this would violate my rule as he technically was a repeat customer but then i realized this was my first affair and with my
stepfather no less
to be perfectly honest
i loved it
talk about electric knowing at any moment she could walk in was better than any drug
it reminded me of when i was young and brought guys home after school
mini and martin are locked in an embrace behind a steamed over glass shower door
at first we were very discreet only doing it when joan crawford wasnt home or was completely comatose
mini and martin post coital catching their breath as they both stare at the ceiling
martin looks over at her and they share a conspiratorial smile
then we got bolder doing it before she would pass out
i think we were seeing exactly how far we could push the envelope
mini and martin poke their heads out from the hallway that leads to minis bedroom
diane is watching tv with a martini glass in her hand
one night we did it before entertainment tonight ended
them under the covers but this time the lights in her room are on
m we even almost got caught
mini and martin stop at the sound of her voice they look at each other realizing dianes right outside
suddenly the door flies open as martin ducks under the covers
diane stands there with a drink in her hand and what appears to be cocaine residue under her nostrils
she appears truly wired and incoherent its unclear whether shes even noticed someone else in the bed
god ive told you a thousand times to knock
have you seen martin
i think he was in his study a half hour ago
cant say that i have
well i assume hes gone out so ive invited ricardo over for a
you know how children make him uneasy so id appreciate if you and
pointing to martin under the sheet your friend could either stay in here or use the back door when he arrives
for a moment mini cant believe her mother appears to have no problem with there being a man in her bed
sure no problem
diane shuts the door
okay shes gone
martin pokes his head out of the covers
the two of them share a smile not believing their luck
they start to laugh and then after a moment she kisses him deeply and they resume where they left off
looking back that may have been the moment we fell in love
mini tries on a cocktail dress as martin looks on giving his approval
we became inseparable
mini sits at the pool side table as martin helps her with her homework
m mom thought it was cute how we had suddenly grown so close and thought it was wonderful how martin had taken an interest in my education
from inside the house diane is seen lighting a cigarette looking out at them and smiling
close on her homework mini has drawn a dirty cartoon which indicates how well endowed he is
she jots down an arrow next to the words actual size
martin blushes averting his eyes
the two of them sit at a romantic table in the candlelight as a waiter refreshes their wine
now that we were spending time together i actually started to find out what martin was like for the first time
martin tells her something and they both crack up
he wasnt the drip i thought he was
the two walk hand in hand stopping to watch the drum rhythm circle filled with local percussionists and on lookers moving to the throbbing beat
he was funny charming sweet and even a little shy
mini jumps into the circle dancing along with the other revelers
martin is content to watch until she runs to the edge of the circle and pulls him in
reluctantly he begins to move with her and slowly start to enjoy himself
mini and martin walk close together but not the way couples do
being seen in public was no sweat as long as we didnt act like a couple
martins mercedes snakes through an s curve as the lights of the city twinkle in the background
this went on for two months before we had the talk we both knew was coming
the car pulls off the road at one of the tourist overlook areas with a view of the city
martin pulls up the parking break and turns to her
i dont want to have to sneak around in my own house
well i dont think telling her is such a hot idea
i mean i dont want to live under the same roof with her
you cant leave shell get half
martin exhales knowing shes right
can i ask how the hell you married her without a pre nup
sighing she wasnt as bad an actress as you think
well there is another option
her eyes harden as she looks out at the city
but it will take some planning
and some resolve
martins eyes suddenly widen
wait you dont mean kill her
she lets the word linger as the rain beats down steadily
no of course not she is my mother
but ive been thinking if she suddenly got ill ill
unstable unpredictable irrational
dangerous to the safety of her husband
she would have to be sent someplace where they could give her the care she needs
martin searches her eyes almost unsure hes heard her right
her gaze is unwavering and after a few seconds he realizes shes serious
he cant help but let the hint of a grin cross his lips
m it would be for her own good
the only truly caring action we could take
as painful as it would be for me to be without my loving wife
you did it for the well being of your daughter
the selfless act of a devoted parent
the sexual tension arises between them as he starts moving closer to her lips
of course well have to make sure her episodes are well documented
she responds in kind tilting her head
and corroborated by friends and people outside the family
a public complaint by a neighbor wouldnt hurt
no that would be useful
their lips are now almost touching
and well find her a very comfortable place out in the country
with lots of fresh air
it will be a much better life for her
unable to stand it their lips meet and they start to hungrily tear at each others clothes
the car rocks gently back and forth in the rain as another car whizzes by spray flying up behind it as it disappears around a curve
mini wakes up with a look of pure joy ready to face the world
i awoke the next morning as excited as i could remember
unlike most firsts which are over too quickly this would take determination
mini swims on her back in the pool a lit cigarette dangling between her lips
mini and martin sit together eating breakfast
diane storms through the living room in the background passing out of sight behind the door frame
i decided to start simply
part one violent mood swings slash uncontrollable rages
cushions from the living room couch fly past the door frame
where are they
mini stirs her coffee innocently
diane again can be seen through the door this time throwing magazines and papers off the coffee table
im gonna be late
it took me three weeks to get an appointment with anton
anton michelle masseuse to the stars and reported possessor of one of the biggest schlongs in town
rumor has it hes pouring the pork to every rich wife between malibu and pasadena
he must be incredible if mary magdalene dragged her ass out of bed this early
and now im gonna miss it because i cant find my fucking car keys
martin and mini exchange a smirk
she turns towards them eyes ablaze
i could use a little help in here
martin looks up from his morning paper as cheerful as can be
mini and martin walk in to see diane on all fours looking under one of the sofas
her panties are blatantly visible from under her mini skirt
mini and martin exchange a smirk
diane sugar do you remember where you put them when you came home last night
yeah in the fucking bowl by the fucking door where i always fucking put them
well uh you were kinda out of it last night
no i wasnt
i had one drink with marie one
uh are you sure
you did seem a bit tipsy
yes im sure you dickless wonder
iane starts rummaging through the drawers of a desk near the front door
under her breath now dont you listen to her you are not a dickless wonder
martin tries not to let on how much hes enjoying this
completely frustrated diane stops looking and heads for the key bowl by the door
mini im taking your car
martin take her to school
diane grabs a set of keys
diane i have a meeting with chapman hes our biggest client opening the door tell him its an emergency
she slams the door behind her
mini looks at martin with a sly grin then removes a cell phone from her pocket and dials a number
as she waits for an answer she twirls dianes key ring around her finger
now here comes the really fun part
i realized a year ago that by lowering my voice a bit i could do a passable job imitating
mimicking diane hello anton
its diane tannen i know its late notice but im going to have to cancel our appointment
no of course i realize ill still have to pay
yes something came up
anton michelle the very muscular it boy masseuse is furiously fucking jeanette lang a similarly hyper aerobicized wife on his massage table
hes bent her over the table and is taking her from behind when suddenly the door flies open
they both look up to see
diane with a stunned expression
french accent but mrs
tannen you call and cancel zee session thirty meenutes ago
no i didnt
yes i spoke to you myself you say sometheeng come up
diane looks at jeanette her eyes narrowing
jeanette you knew i had an appointment today did you pretend flustered no i i
anton called me and told me he had a cancellation
yes i call her after you call me
jeanette nervously tries to wrap the massage towel around herself
why you sneaky little bitch
suddenly diane lunges for jeanette grabbing her by the hair and pulling her off the table
jeannette shrieks as anton struggles to pull up his pants and pry them apart
diane sits at the table with her arm in a sling
martin cuts her meat for her as mini pours her some red wine
needless to say word of the lincident de anton spread quickly through the community
do you think shell press charges
are you kidding
she should get twenty to life
when i told margo and penny about her little stunt they both said theyd have ripped her eyes out
shell be lucky if anyone speaks to her again
martin holds up a forkful of food
here comes the choo choo
diane grabs the fork with her good hand
for gods sake i didnt break both hands
jeez i still cant believe you broke your hand on her face
its so linda hamilton
slugging some wine i hope she enjoys shitting out the teeth she swallowed
close on the stores owner carlos picking up the osa angelica this is carlos
hello carlos its diane tannen calling
ah si senora tannen como esta
annoyed uh carlos
taken aback okay
im going to need a delivery to the house
a moonwalk inflatable carnival ride is being inflated on the front lawn by a worker as two jugglers warm up next to it tossing clubs between them
phase two wild shopping sprees carried out in a euphoric state
five delivery vans from rosa angelica are parked outside as five delivery boys unload their cargo
it appears that they have brought the entire inventory of rosa angelica
dozens of bouquets and arrangements line the driveway
mini stands outside next to carlos sucking on a lollipop
gosh look at all the pretty flowers
your mother said you are having a big party
innocently i know can you believe all this
just then dianes jaguar pulls into the driveway
she looks at the trucks her expression souring
she stops the car and flies out
carlos what the hell is going on
senora tannen the delivery you ordered yesterday for the party
ordered i didnt order anything
who told you to bring these here
flustered but but senora you did you called me i talked to you
no you didnt
si you said you were having a party dont you remember
you were very excited saying you were going to have the most wonderful party and invite everyone you knew and it had to be just perfect
perfect thats what you said
m mom is that what you were talking about yesterday
well it was after lunch and you had washed your pain killers down with some wine
you mumbled something about a party before you took a nap
no i did not
wincing mom you did
the doctor said no more mixing pain killers and alcohol
i only slept for to carlos i am so sorry
listen well pay dont worry
mini leads carlos back to his vans just martins mercedes pulls up
diane turns around to see his car and a look of dread strikes her
right on cue
lets see how convincing he is
martin gets out of the car surveying the damage
a look of pure indignant outrage overcomes him and its impossible to tell this is an act
what is going on
carlos what the fuck are all these flowers doing here
oooh now i see why he makes the big bucks
senor tannen we uh martin i i
diane did you order all this
mom go inside just go ill handle him
trying to calm him its under control dad
please lets not make a scene
mini opens the front door to find a delivery van from waterford crystal pull up
over the next few days whenever mom had passed out from too much drinky drinky
the door opens again as a furrier holding a full length mink coat stands before her with a big smile on his face
id pull out her wallet
a salesman dangling the keys to a ford mustang convertible which is parked behind him in the driveway
and reach out and touch someone
a flatbed truck hauling a foot sailboat behind it pulls up in front of the house
its really remarkable what you can order with a platinum card these days
a strung out diane sits on the couch smoking and nursing a vodka tonic
the doorbell rings and diane reacts like a dog in a thunderstorm a jolt of fear coursing through her body
talk about easy
after a week of my version of the home shopping network the doorbell might as well have been a canon
diane gets up and walks unsteadily towards the front door
mini and kayla sit in a history class looking dreamily at their teacher warren bishop an earnest young preppy in the middle of a lecture
at this point dear old mummy was so spooked i was actually afraid she might stop drinking
so i needed a back up plan to keep her
as we see from a closer examination of the facts abraham lincolns decision to
bishops voice fades out as he continues to speak
now heres someone id like to make sit roll over and then toss me his snausage
priorities are priorities
mini raises her hand
bishop can i go to the little girls room
of course mini
mini walks down the empty corridor
the school nurse helga hauptfuhrer and very aryan enters the empty bathroom and walks into a stall
the school nurse a regimented kraut lush named helga hauptfuhrer or der fuhrer as she was affectionately known starts jonesing for her afternoon nip
hauptfuhrer sits down and takes a bottle of vodka out of her nurses coat
exactly minutes after lunch each day
she takes a long slug
mini quickly picks the flimsy lock on the medicine cabinet with a paper clip
she quickly looks through the bottles
which leaves me free to help myself to the candy store
mini finds what she needs and holds it up to read the label
close on the label indicating ritalin and the dosage
mini quickly closes the cabinet walks out and stuffs the bottle in her pocket just before hauptfuhrer enters
thank god for the quack who invented add and the lazy parents willing to let der fuhrer keep their kids comfortably numb on what basically amounts to legalized speed
mini stands at the counter making her mom a margarita
shes cutting up all kinds of tropical fruits and putting them into a blender
my fears of mom giving up the sauce were unfounded
actually she started drinking more
she then takes a few tablets of ritalin and grinds them up with their coffee grinder
she pours that into the blender and puts the lid on
which gave me the perfect opportunity to prescribe her a little pick me up
she turns on the blender
dianes getting dressed for a party trying to gracefully camouflage her cast with jewelry
i asked you for that drink ten minutes ago
mini walks in carrying the margarita
put it on the counter
diane takes a pain killer and washes it down with the margarita
this is really good
whats in it sweetie
the first time in my life she calls me sweetie and ive just slipped her the mother of all mickeys
oh this and that
the party is chock full of trophy wives and their decidedly less attractive husbands
diane is in a full blown booze and ritalin induced monologue having cornered two women
my god let me tell you breaking my hand on that bitchs face
the two women recoil
was the best thing that ever happened to me
phase three rambling incoherent monologues in public
i feel fantastic just fabulous
i mean i feel like i could run a marathon like that bruce jenner guy
he did that right
boy ill tell you before he had that face lift that made him look like a drag queen i wouldve let him stick his javelin in me any day
suddenly her ears unconsciously pick up the strands of a conversation going on behind them between two husbands
so i looked each and every juror in the eye
spinning around i want to talk to you about juries will you come and talk to me about juries
id like to be on a jury and say guilty
what do you think goes on in all the sequestered situations
do you think any of the jurors have sex with each other
i was once on an episode of love boat playing the role of bikini girl and my line was ill have another it was with isaac at the pool bar
i had to suck one of the associate producers off to get the line but it got me my sag card so i guess it was worth it
he men shoot each other an uncomfortable glance
uh i think i could use a refill
me too to diane please excuse us
they head towards the bar and diane follows
the two women she turned away from shake their heads at the spectacle
but but we were talking about juries and isaac and and that drag queen i broke my face on and
the two men try to ignore her but she keeps following them
she finally realizes they arent stopping
she grabs the first man by the shoulder pissed
the party stops
everyone is staring at diane as the music continues to play
she looks around the room at the disapproving eyes panic setting in
diane is led away by martin and mini as other partygoers watch the sad scene
they both struggle to keep diane from stumbling
slurring and then i told him that i had been an extra on hello larry and mike farrell had tried to maclean stevenson
maclean stevenson played larry
right thats what i said
and then mackenzie phillips tried to slip me the tongue
diane lies passed out on the bed as mini and martin watch her sleep
listen great job but you need to give me more warning
i was at dinner with chapman and its the second time ive had to re schedule
im sorry but it was a golden opportunity
you always said you cant pay enough for good publicity
mini and martin peruse the aisles
at this point with all those witnesses martin thought we could get a shrink to have her sent away
hey stop in front of a wall of tools hand axes hammers and saws
mini selects a large hand axe
my feeling was that until they were ready to weld the door to her padded cell shut
mini picking out two black ski masks two pairs of black goggles and two black sweatsuits
there was more work to be done
diane walks through the mall aimlessly
she wears a wrinkled mis buttoned pink blouse
her eyes are hollow her cheeks sunken
a few shoppers throw her a concerned glance as they pass
final phase complete psychotic breakdown
mini disguised in a hat and sunglasses leans on the railing from the next level up watching her mother
mini slides into a table next to two skatepunks
the two guys exchange a glance
cute girls like mini clearly dont hey boys them
wanna have a little fun
diane looks at some clothes
her cell phone goes off and she answers it
breathy threatening diane
the breathing increases getting deeper and more menacing
what do you want
i can see you
can you see me
alarmed who is this
do you feel safe
looking around who is this
you didnt answer the question
mini and the two skatepunks giggle with glee at the terror theyre inflicting
she looks around scanning the mall
nothing seems out of the ordinary
d this isnt funny
im hanging up
i wouldnt do that
if this is some kind of joke
i assure you im no joke
may i say that pink blouse is very fetching
panicked she heads for an exit
a few shoppers look at her with concern
diane your car is the other way
menacing now answer my question
do you feel safe
a whimper escapes from her throat as she looks around
im hanging up
very calm hang up and youre dead
falling apart why are you doing this
can you see me
she scans the crowd frantically then starts walking towards a victorias secret store for help
pick me out something sexy
leave me alone
very calm but im so close to you
she stops frozen in fear
just then the second skatepunk comes up behind her brushing into her
she jerks away from him
screeching get away
every shopper within ear shot turns around including two take it easy lady what the hells your problem
the skatepunk walks away
mini and the first skatepunk watch with amusement from an upper level as a security guard moves towards her
peek a boo
im coming for you
but that guard cant help you
maybe you should make a run for that gold jag you drive home to mira loma lane
whimpering how do you know where i live
i know everything about you
diane spins around to find two security guards standing behind her
im going to have to ask you to leave the mall
well walk you to your car
i cant leave he knows where i live
maam youre going to have to leave
did you hear me
he knows where i live
she hands him the phone
the security guard puts the phone to his ear
the beeping sound of a hang up is heard
he nods to his partner as he removes a walkie talkie
into walkie talkie yeah this is franklin weve got a code get an ems unit over here
the two guards grab her
she drops the phone and starts scratching at one guards face
the other pepper sprays her as she falls down howling
what are you doing
sorry maam this is for your own protection
the phone is like a jolt of electricity through her body
diane kicks and punches at the guards
he said he was gonna kill me
the guards finally tackle her getting handcuffs on
he he knows where i live
the other shoppers watch for a moment and lose interest writing her off as just another la kook
mini watches from the upper level quite satisfied
diane lies in bed half awake watching tv
a scotch and soda rests in her hand
after her performance at the mall im sure she would have qualified as committable
but that wasnt enough i wanted her to beg the boys in the white coats to take her away
mini pokes her head in the door of the room
mom were going to get some dinner
do you want us to bring you back something
both of you
for the last three days she hasnt left the house
why dont we just order in
mom we cant stay in here forever
do you want to come with us
diane considers the question by looking at her face in the bed side mirror
its still puffy and blotchy from the pepper spray
she looks up at mini
vanity the most predictable of sins
you two go
it is dark and quiet as the evening dew rises on the lawn
diane is almost asleep when the phone next to the bed rings waking her up
she stares at it for a moment trying to decide if she should answer it
on the forth ring she answers
a dial tone rings in her ear
she hangs up the phone
a second later it rings again
she waits two rings and then answers
again a dial tone
now a bit freaked diane is fully awake and staring at the phone waiting
something small hits the window across the room
startled she turns her head towards it
dianes pov through the window in the distance by the hedges a black clad figure is visible wearing a ski mask and goggles
in the figures right hand there is a gleaming sharp kitchen knife
she cant believe her eyes
her pov the figure stands silently bringing the knife up indicating that hes going to cut her throat
eyes wild with panic diane picks up the phone and dials
the phone dials and she waits
please please oh god
she looks back out the window the hooded figure walks out of the bushes and heads towards the house
you have reached if this is an emergency please remain on the line
oh god oh god
diane realizes she doesnt have time to wait and runs out of the room leaving the phone off the hook
diane stumbles down the hallway almost tripping on the steps down to the living room
she goes straight for the phone on the end table next to the couch
she picks it up
please continue to hold your call will be answered
she hangs up the phone and looks back at the hallway but as she does she sees reflected in a wall mirror another black clad figure outside the living room
window but this one holds a hand axe
she turns around to look out the window
the figure raises the axe slowly
she heads towards the front door to scream for help but the axe wielding figure moves swiftly towards the door making it unsafe for her to even try
her face dissolves into utter despair as she stumbles out of the room
diane runs in to check that the sliding doors are locked
she clicks the lock shut just as the first figure with the knife appears in the door frame
diane is transfixed by her own eyes reflected in the lenses of the goggles
softly no please no
she slowly backs away from the door as the figure tries to open it
the door frame rattles on its track as the figure violently tugs at the handle
someone please help me
she runs back in checking the window
she decides to check the front door
she runs over and looks out the peep hole
peep hole pov it appears clear
she starts to undo the lock and then slowly peeks through the slit in the door leaving the chain on
through the slit everything looks good
she opens the door and looks towards the front gate which is open
she looks as if shes thinking of making a dash for the gates
just then from behind the gate steps the axe it shakes a finger no at her as it walks towards the house
terrified she slams the door locking it behind her
she instinctively pushes her back against the door hyper ventilating
she looks up at the ceiling her eyes filling with tears
please god please god
she looks around the room searching for options
suddenly her eyes bulge as she sees the knife wielding figure standing not ten feet away in the door to the kitchen
diane screams and runs back down the hallway towards the bedroom
the knife wielding figure follows behind her
she looks back as it runs after her grabbing her by the shoulder
she shrieks and struggles out of its grasp before running in the bathroom and slamming the door
diane throws her weight against the door struggling to keep the intruder out
she looks for anything to help her and then sees in the window to the bathroom
the axe wielding figure standing silently staring back at her
iane collapses to the floor in a pool of tears
she looks up again at the window its empty
the pushing on the door suddenly stops but diane is so disturbed she doesnt notice through her sobs
a pair of black gloved hands puts the bedroom phone back on its cradle
our work finished
mini and martin laugh and giggle at the enormous slabs of beef put in front of them
we rewarded ourselves on a job well done
mini and martin walk down the hallway towards the master bedroom
and we returned home expecting to find her blabbering like a three year old
mom were home
diane honey we brought you a pulled pork plate
they reach the door to the bathroom
its still closed
martin and mini exchange a look not believing that diane could still be in there
martin tries the door
diane still appears to be leaning against it
he pushes hard on the door opening it a few inches
mini reaches in and shoves diane over so they can can open the door
she appears drugged
they lay her flat and try to wake her up
diane its us wake up
mini slaps her hard across the face
feigning concern wake up mommy
martin lightly taps dianes cheeks
diane come on come on
mini looks up at the counter
an empty bottle of prescription sleeping pills lies open next to the sink
e looks up and immediately sees the bottle
i picked that prescription up three days ago
it was probably more than half full
the two of them look at each other studying each others reaction
seconds go by as both wait for the other to make the first move
eerily calm i suppose we should call an ambulance
the suggestion hangs in the air as martin feels dianes wrist again
her pulse is almost gone
do you really think they can save her
i dont know
shell only try it again
you know she will
she will if we keep this torture up
martin looks down at diane
suddenly with resolve this is wrong call an ambulance
hold on who are we to say her choice was wrong
she put those pills in her mouth
mini dont mini me youve been bankrolling my little project from day one
we both agreed murder was out
id hardly call it murder if anything were just helping to fulfill her last wish
she wouldnt have taken the pills if we hadnt urgently mini for gods sake she still has a pulse
so do people in comas
its just a matter of time mini we look you can drop the indignant outrage because if you really cared youd have already grabbed the phone and dialed by now
shes got him and he knows it
softening cant we just admit how lucky we are
its the perfect alibi she put the drugs in her system
just leave her here
i dont know
can you think of one person she knows who would say shes sane at this point
this is just the natural sad and inevitable conclusion to a tragic life
artin ponders the choice
were this close from being free
lets just let nature take its course
mini and martin sit watching a game show called absolutely positive
and so we passed the time watching my favorite show
a young male game show host comes out on stage to the applause of the audience
welcome to absolutely positive
the show where we give couples about to get married a last chance to make sure theyre
he puts a hand to his ear encouraging the studio audience
we send them out on one last date with someone other than their fiance so they can be sure theyre really ready to make that lifelong commitment
our neighbor mike rudell the scumbag at my birthday produces it and its so twisted im surprised i didnt think of it
on the screen the host introduces the couple who nervously walk out to the studio applause
take happy couples about to marry and try to break them up
the catch is the couples are always sent on dates with people just a little better looking than their fiances
then the two dates are brought out to sit on either side of the couple
both dates are indeed slightly better looking than the engaged couple
mini checks dianes pulse
and we waited some more
martin sits on the couch
he looks up as mini comes in from the bathroom shaking her head no indicating shes not dead yet
mini checks dianes pulse again
typical mom she managed to fuck up her last act of free will
the oclock news is starting as mini impatiently looks towards the hallway leading to the bathroom
finally it was time to do the only humane thing
mini stands up
come on lets go
its time to speed this up
speed this up
we cant wait anymore our alibi is only believable for maybe another hour
we can say that after dinner we went to a movie but if she hasnt croaked by midnight you can forget about this
martin looks at her for a long moment clearly realizing the implications of speed this up
no im sorry this is going somewhere im not prepared to go
oh but you were prepared to sit here until the pills did her in
i hate to break it to you but wherever you werent prepared to go
the hypocrite express just rolled into the station
martin stares straight ahead coming to grips with the truth of his actions
what are you suggesting
well i thought wed disembowel her and leave her for the raccoons
god youve lost your sense of humor
dont worry itll be painless
martin takes a deep breath considering his options
mini goes through her mothers clothes as diane lies crumpled in a heap on the floor
martin looks on impatiently
to be honest i think we both knew in our hearts it would come to this
and as my first assisted suicide i was going to make it flawless
m come on we dont have time
look if were going to screw up the details we might as well call san quentin and tell them to fire up the dutch oven
off his confusion the gas chamber
exasperated martin please i cant explain everything
mini holds a chic black chanel suit up to the full length mirror
mini applying make up and lipstick to dianes face in front of her vanity mirror
martin holds dianes head still
i dont think this is a good idea
have you lost your mind mr
whats the one thing all her friends are going to be talking about when they find out
waits for his answer how did she look
do you think anyone will think twice if the answer is fabulous
the door to the dark garage opens and mini turns on a light
martin carrying diane now dressed in the suit over his shoulder struggles through the doorway
mini props diane up in the drivers seat and begins touching up the make up
she ties a silk scarf around dianes neck ever so elegantly
satisfied she turns the ignition key and lowers all the power windows in the car
she looks up at martin
well if youve got anything to say to her now would be the time
could you just pretend to have a little remorse
mini and martin walk through the door to the garage and close it behind them
the hum of the car engine can he heard through the wall
diane sits in the drivers seat as the exhaust pipe spews fumes into the sealed garage
the garage door is open and dianes body is visible on the garage floor as martin and mini kneel beside her
the wail of an ambulance siren is heard as it pulls up in front cutting the engine
mini comes running outside in tears
help us please
my mom i think shes dead
two paramedics try to revive diane having laid her out on the floor of the garage
mini sobs hysterically as martin hugs her
mommy wake up
its okay sweetheart everythings going to be okay
tannen i think you should take your daughter in the house
oh please dont let her die
two police cruisers are parked outside as dianes body now wrapped in a body bag is being wheeled into the ambulance
a few looky loos are standing at the gates to the house interested to see whats happened
one of the paramedics fills out a report on a clipboard in the background as martin continues to comfort mini
a man with a slightly weary look walks in the front door wearing an off the rack grey suit and barber shop haircut
martin looks up
im detective bill garson lapd
im sorry to be here right now but whenever theres an apparent suicide we are required to do an investigation to rule out homicide
clearly surprised oh
its really just a formality
exploding my mother just killed herself
they havent even taken her away yet
whats wrong with you
hes just doing his job
tell him to leave
this is outrageous
to garson could we do this another time
of course we thank you
mini looks at martin relieved
but i do need to ask just a few simple questions before i go
didnt you hear him
he said sharply mini its okay
just go lie down for a moment
martin stands in the garage with garson going over what happened
so after dinner and the movie we came home at around and found her in the garage
i turned off the car and opened the garage door to let out the exhaust
what about trying to revive your wife
martin seems a bit taken aback by the question
of course we did that too but i couldnt feel a pulse
mini took a course at school in cpr and tried that but
taking a breath it didnt work
so your wife did this sometime between and when you placed the call
may i ask why you left your wife alone when she had been acting in such an unstable state
we never thought shed do anything like
after the episode in the mall diane hadnt left the house for three days and my daughter and i just needed a break
its been a very stressful time
so this was your wifes car
was it in the garage when you left for dinner or did she drive it in
was it in the garage when you left
a little flustered is is that important
just trying to reconstruct what happened
after she was brought home from the mall the car was towed here and we put it in the garage
and no one drove it during those three days
no mini and i have our own cars
we are going to have to impound it for a few days to take it to the crime lab
again purely routine
have you found a note yet
confused im sorry
garsons eyes flicker for a split second
a suicide note
the deceased usually leaves one
but we havent really looked
mind if i take a look around
martin hesitates for just a split second
of course not
mini and martin whisper together
who cares if we didnt leave a note
but they said its so what
hell do his little dance and chalk it up to another failed actress who realized after forty she might as well be dead
remembering something oh shit
the sweatsuits and goggles
i already snuck out the back and threw them in mike rudells garbage cans
angelpie just relax we did it were free
martin and mini arrive in a shuttle bus in front of the lush resort
after the funeral i felt it would be good idea if we took a vacation and went somewhere where we could act like a real couple for the first time
artin tips the bell hop on the way out and the moment the door closes mini jumps into his arms
martin agreed and let me pick the place
i chose las hadas in mexico because thats where dudley moore and bo derek did it in ten
martin spreads sun tan lotion on minis back
i figured sugar daddy younger woman would be old news down there
a few other older man younger woman couples lounge near them mixed among more traditional pairings
mariachis play a sexy mexican ballad as mini wearing a thin sundress dances very close with martin
i could feel that martin had let the whole thing with the cops go
it had been two weeks since moms death and it already felt like it happened a year ago
mini lies on top of martin on a lounge chair
they both stare up at the stars
the gentle breaking of waves further adds to the tranquility of the evening
you know ive been thinking that i might enjoy working in your office this summer
sure if you want
she moves to kiss him
is that you
martin and mini look up to see mike rudell their producer neighbor peering at them in the dark
he has an arm wrapped around the waist of a young blonde who is clearly playmate material
i swear i thought martin was going to wet himself
mini quickly sits up trying to make it look like innocent father daughter closeness
extremely tense oh
hi mike what what are you doing here
udell comes over clearly aware of how un father daughter they were lying
last week mini mentioned you two were coming here for a little r r and i suddenly realized i hadnt taken a vacation in god knows when
jennifer this is my neighbor martin tannen and his daughter mini
martin barely looks at jennifer as he shakes her hand
she looks equally uncomfortable
im sorry but jennifer have we met
you look so familiar
jennifer looks quite uneasy as she forces a smile
i dont think so
and the icing is that jennifer works for the same escort service that i did
now this is rich
i wanted you both to know how sorry i am for your loss
he just lost six or seven freebies a year
if theres anything i can do
to mini for either of you
yikes now that moms out of the way i guess im fair game
dont hesitate to ask
remember im just right across the fence
the meaning is not lost on martin
measured thanks mike we appreciate it
martin paces back and forth as mini sits on the bed
his neck muscles bulge with frustration
why did you tell him
i was just being friendly i had no idea hed decide to come here
he found the clothes and goggles and he fucking knows
i doubt he even knows where his trash cans are
its just coincidence
yeah well coincidence or not he saw us together
it was dark i sat up before he saw anything
m no he knows
it was like he was toying with us
just relax what is he going to do
go home and tell everyone were a couple
well just laugh it off and tell everyone he vacations with hookers
martin stops and looks at her surprised
oh come on could that little moment between you and jennifer have been any more awkward
his face turns a little red
im not jealous or anything i just think its funny
talk about six degrees of penetration
martin rubs his temples clearly overwhelmed
you realize he could blackmail us
if the police found out about us that suicide wouldnt look so routine
martin please calm down
trust me nothing is going to happen
her words dont appear to have calmed him
martin sits on a lounger reading a book and looking very unhappy
from the pool mini emerges soaking wet in a bikini
the next few days were a laugh riot
martin looks up from the book looking around suspiciously
suddenly mini appears behind him and gives him a kiss on the mouth
he instinctively pulls back
suddenly martin was acting like he really was my father
just then rudell and his bimbo enter the pool area waving at them
minis head is not close enough for the scene to look incriminating but martin is too spooked to know the difference
mini and martin sit watching tv
mini flips channels stopping at absolutely positive
martin snatches the remote and grumpily changes m channels
mini looks very annoyed
we returned home and things didnt get much better
mini trying on various sexy outfits in front of her mirror catholic school girl
what little sex we were having was getting dull
quite frankly with my little project successfully completed
i was bored
i became concerned that in my world of firsts i had achieved my greatest first
at too young an age
marilyn monroe in the sequined dress she sang to jfk in
singing breathily happy birthday mr
president as for school well i was just in no state to return to my studies after the trauma of my mothers death
the door bell rings
mini looks towards the hallway
mini answers it having removed her marilyn wig but still in the sequined dress
detective garson stands at the door looking her up and down
mini hides her surprise well
minerva tannen detective garson i dont know if you remember me
drogues my last name is drogues
and yes i remember you you were the big hearted lug who wanted your questions answered while my mother was still warm
ignoring her dig so mr
tannen is your stepfather
nice work mcgruff
again i am sorry about that night but it is policy that we get the preliminary facts as soon as possible
what do you want
i need to ask you a few more questions about your mothers death
m sure come on in
mini leads him in
i know its stupid as hell to talk to a cop without a lawyer but i didnt want to look jumpy and my first real interrogation
i could feel something tingle deep inside
mini and garson take a seat
mini lights a cigarette
garson looks over her outfit again
its a little early for the prom isnt it
a girl can dream cant she
so anyway we got the preliminary coroners report
although the pills knocked her out she died of the carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust
is it that important
well its just a little unusual for a suicide victim to use two methods
her choices seemed i dont know how to put it
well maybe she wanted to drift off before the fumes got her
she clearly put some thought into that outfit
but dying from carbon monoxide poisoning is actually pretty painless you just basically pass out
i doubt she would have had an intimate knowledge of how car fumes feel when you choke on them
i suppose youre right
also we checked the phone records and there was a call placed at
it was a hang up and when the dispatcher called back a few minutes later there was no answer
any idea why shed call
okie fine this may be the most exciting thing ive done in a while but even i know when the rush isnt worth the risk
look i think you should come back when my fathers around
hell be upset i let a stranger in the house
g i think youre safe with me
even so he wont be happy
not a problem will he be home tonight
martin is on the phone
and you let him in
mini lounges in a bikini talking on the cordless phone while sucking on a red popsicle
i played it cool it wouldve looked worse to be defensive
mini looks across the yard to see
mike rudell looking down at her from the upstairs balcony of his home
hes dressed in a plush terry cloth robe and is smoking a pipe which he raises in greeting
his eyes are locked on hers
well whens he coming over
ive got a dinner with chapman
ive already cancelled frustrated damn it
why didnt you call me
rudell allows the folds of his robe to open in the breeze revealing his chest and pair of silk boxers
hes in good shape for a man his age
annoyed hey i didnt know you had plans
mini responds to rudells challenge lowering a strap on her bikini top
listen ill be home early so we can get the story straight
mini hangs up the phone removing the popsicle slowly from her mouth
martin and mini sit across from garson
martin appears cool and relaxed a scotch in his hand
i really appreciate you taking the time to help us out
theres just a few loose ends we want to tie up
what would you like to know
garson opens his briefcase and removes a report
he starts leafing through papers
there appears to be some question as to the time of death
you said you went to dinner and a movie detective not to be overly sensitive but do i need my lawyer here
because these sound like the questions one asks when theres a homicide investigation
tannen id really like to just finish this up ive got real homicides that need attention
how about if i just ask you some questions and the ones you dont want to answer well just skip
that sounds good doesnt it dad
i mean lets just get this over with
martin looks at mini trying hard not to allow his anger to escape for a second
now the preliminary blood report indicated she had ritalin in her system
minis eyes shift between garson and his note pad
i wasnt aware my wife was taking ritalin
neither was her physician he had never prescribed it
well as you may have discovered by now my wife had substance abuse problems im sure there were many drugs she took without a prescription
i know but its an odd drug to be taking
its mostly given to adults and children with attention deficit disorder to calm them
but in people who dont need it it has the reverse effect making them incredibly hyper and agitated
again detective i really cant say why she was taking these drugs
tannen were you and your wife close
we led for the most part separate lives
we had decided to stay together for mini
sacrifice personal happiness for the benefit of the child
listen detective garson i must admit i dont see the relevance of these questions
diane was an extremely disturbed person
havent you interviewed enough people who saw her at her worst
yes but what im still unclear about is her time of death
well that makes two of us
again detective we were out for the whole evening
looking at his notes after dinner you saw a movie that night
start time oclock
what did you see
that new jackie chan movie where the terrorists try to blow up mount rushmore
running time minutes
my buddy told me the end is crazy
for god sakes does he think we wouldnt actually see it
yeah he slides down washingtons nose with the bomb strapped to him
dont give it away he hasnt seen it yet
martin turns to mini giving her a fatherly smile
mini rolls her eyes at garson
where did you see it
drive time minutes
and you got home at
with minutes of previews
you didnt think wed forget the previews
now if there arent any more questions it is a school night
no that about wraps it up for now
detective we are trying very hard to put our lives back together but every time you come by it just dredges everything back up
weve told you everything we know
g i wish i could be more definitive
well im telling you the next time you have a question it had better be because youre charging us us
martin momentarily freezes
im just asking you to please let us deal with our grief and get on with our lives
standing thanks again for your time
mini sits in a chair as martin paces
what the hell was i thinking letting you talk me into this
its probably just routine stuff
that was not routine my dear
nice use of the word us by the way
sorry it just slipped out
if i had a nickel for every time i heard that sharply okay
look just chill im sure this will blow over in a few days
believe me well be chilling in a pine box if he figures everything out
you do understand they could go for the death penalty
hes probably just trying to spook us
they dont try and spook you unless they think you did it
it was a great plan no one can prove we stuck those sleeping pills in her mouth because we didnt
seething well if it was such a great plan why am i cancelling business dinners to accommodate a detective who appears convinced it wasnt a suicide
mini glares at him and then stands up heading inside
ill see you later
where are you going
the club is packed with young latino clubhoppers gyrating to the pulsating beat
mini in a tight crimson dress has attracted quite a crowd as she dances very provocatively with a muscular young latino
would he follow
his face and shoulders glisten with sweat as she lifts one leg around his waist and then the other
as she straddles him their hips rocking together she puts her arms around his neck and leans all the way back her hair hanging down in ecstasy
as she pulls herself back up her eyes scan the room
martin stands in the back watching her his eyes sullen
was there any question
minis eyes move quickly enough past him that its ambiguous to him whether she spotted him or not
martin watches as mini leans in and in slow motion gives her partner a deep long kiss
martin looks ill
minis car pulls into the driveway
she gets out looking rumpled
mini walks in to find martin sitting at the table in a bathrobe
hes reading the paper with a cup of coffee
mini opens the fridge and removes a carton of orange juice taking a big slug
a phone call would have been appreciated at some point
i was worried
worried that refugee from a j
lo video rode me til the tires fell off
martin im not sure youre aware but at this point you cant be my dad and my lover
where i go and how late i stay out is my business
i wasnt saying that as a dad
very sincere before your mother and i
grew apart i would worry if she was out late
well thats sweet but im not her and i can assure you i wont end up passed out in some greaseballs fuck pad with my panties around my ankles
cold smooth nless i choose to
what the hells gotten into you
i just expressed concern for you and you turn around and threaten me
mini in a relationship its okay to worry about someone else
i kind of have to admire this
he really is one of the worlds premiere bullshit artists
havent you ever been in a relationship
the questions hangs in the air
mini looks down almost ashamed
my god you havent
she tries to hold back the tears as she looks up
sniffling youre my first
he comes over and gives her a very sweet hug
and id like to thank the academy and god and oh yeah free tibet
martin rides up in the elevator with other office workers
his eyes look tired from staying up all night
fake tears aside
he actually was my first relationship
which in itself was significant because i had always felt that by living my life by the rule of firsts i would never be able to find someone who could
accept me on those terms
he strides off the elevator sending hellos and nods to his employees as he passes the large corporate logo boyd and i was willing to give him the chance to
be that person
he reaches his desk where his young secretary lois is waiting with an envelope
if he could just hold it together
tannen this just arrived for you
she hands him a manila envelope marked martin tannen via messenger
he takes it from her and walks into his office sitting down
he opens the package to find an x glossy photo of
mini sitting with him at the pool in mexico
the caption reads thank heaven for little girls
thats when things started to get interesting
martin looks up the empty look in his eyes revealing a terrified mind already calculating the potential outcomes
he examines the envelope
there is a speedway courier sticker but no return address
martin angrily honks his horn in slow traffic as he talks on his cell
lois i need you to re schedule the chapman meeting
listening i know
tell him its an unavoidable emergency
martin stands at the front desk talking to a clerk
what do you mean you dont keep records on who your senders are
when its paid cash we only keep records on packages not envelopes
martin walks outside frustrated
his cell goes off and he answers it
tannen i just spoke to mr
he told me to tell you that hes going to be seeking a new firm to handle his companys needs
martins jaw tightens
thank you lois
martin hangs up the phone as he looks up he sees across the street a large sign on a modern office building rudell martin closes his eyes trying to remain
martin walks into the office to find his partners steve boyd and charles mather waiting for him
martin looks surprised and concerned
what what are you doing in town
why didnt you tell me you were coming we just heard about chapman
not that it matters
we cant afford to lose any more clients
the color drains from martins face
jesus guys my wife just committed suicide
no ones saying this isnt a difficult time for you but whatevers been distracting you started long before that
theres just no way to sugarcoat this
youre a liability we cant afford anymore
martin sits very still his world crumbling around him
curtly well be asking all our clients who they would prefer to stay with and of course youll have an equal shot to make your case with them
martin continues to stare off into space reeling
martin sits in the traffic on beverly glen
the veins in his neck are starting to bulge as he stares straight ahead
suddenly he starts pounding on the steering wheel
just then he looks over to the next car
a three year old girl in the back seat holds up her po teletubby doll to show him
through a binoculars viewfinder rudell is seen through the window talking on the phone unaware hes being watched
look at that smug prick
hes fucking with me and i will not be fucked with
martin and mini stand in the dark kitchen as martin peers out the window through binoculars at rudell across the yard
what are you gonna do
martin goes to a drawer and removes the large knife they bought at williams sonoma
im gonna go over there and tell him to back off or hes gonna get hurt
are you crazy
were not even positive its him
my god the picture was dropped off at a messenger service right across the street from his office
he was the only person at the resort who knew who we were
he could go to the cops and tell them you threatened him then theyd really start investigating us
its just one photo and you cant even really tell if its me
that son of bitch just cost me the firm i worked fifteen years to build
well if you start waving that thing around hes gonna cost you a lot more than that
mini lies awake looking annoyed as martin keeps turning and shifting in bed
martin didnt sleep at all that night and made damn well sure i didnt either
mini walks up the long driveway
with mommy dearest out of the way i decided to take the matter of rudell into my own hands
i knew martin wouldnt approve but at this point
action had to be taken
she arrives at the front door and rings the bell
i would catch him off guard disorient him and then kill him
the door opens and rudell stands before her in the same plush bathrobe
rudell im sorry to bother you
not at all as i said down in mexico
slightly lascivious anything for a neighbor
may i come in
eighteen foot ceilings frame the room garishly decorated with very modern modular furniture
rudell leads mini in
wow i havent been here since you redecorated
it was just finished
im sorry your mother never got to see it completed
i know shed approve
if you dont mind me asking
how are you doing
its been hard but i guess ive just been telling myself that shes probably much happier where she is now
mini giggles almost embarrassed
chuckling well that too but correct was the word i was thinking of
do you like the show
oh god its my favorite
i love how you never know if the couples will decide to stay together
i could arrange for you to go to the set one day if youd like or even be a contestant
sure those dates are really quite harmless
you just spend an evening with the person
we prep you on what to say before the show
it sounds like fun
rudell lets his eyes take a walk all over her
mini keenly aware blushes
anyway whats on your mind
this may sound strange but you havent seen any suspicious looking people around our house lately
no is everything okay
yes its just that since moms death someone sent us a photo of martin and i together
it indicated that we were
i know this sounds crazy but
you and martin
i mean certainly older men and younger women are an searching again accepted part of society but for someone to do that well
its just tasteless
exactly so were just trying to figure who rit could be
hmm i havent noticed anyone at all
out of curiosity what kind of a picture could they send you to indicate that you and martin were together
oh it wasnt like we were naked or anything
i mean of course hes seen me naked he is my step father
mini and rudell sit at a table enjoying iced teas as mini flirts shamelessly with him
much to my surprise i was invited to stay for a refreshing beverage
rudell shows mini around his collection of rare tropical flowers
he plucks a tiger lily off a stem and puts it in her hair
i knew he had had no shortage of young women in his bed but he had been paying for it in one form or another for a long time
rudell shows mini how to use a pitching wedge on the small putting green off his back patio
he stands behind her wrapping his arms around her guiding her arms through the swing
and the one undeniable fact i had learned from martin is that there is no greater thrill or triumph in a mans life
rudell makes her a giant banana split covering it with whip cream
than getting a ripe young woman to open the gates to heaven for no other reason than she wanted to
he accidently gets some whip cream on his nose
mini reaches over and wipes it off licking her finger clean
rudell tries to hide the wonderment in his eyes
frankly im surprised the anticipation of pulling off a mother daughter double dip didnt give him a stroke right there
mini walks out skipping down the path singing the candy man to herself
who can take tomorrow
dip it in a dream separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream the candy man oh the candy man can
i left that day exhilarated in the knowledge that in one afternoon i had turned rudell into a trout on a line
and hed follow me anywhere i tugged the pole
singing the candy man can cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good
mini walks down the corridor with kayla
the photos stopped coming and although martin was freaking out about his business things were returning to normal
i even decided to return to school
they approach troy the football player she humiliated earlier
mini raises two fingers to her mouth in a v simulating cunnilingus taunting troy
his friends laugh and he wilts pretending he didnt see her
mini and kayla walk in with other students
her teacher warren bishop comes over to her immediately
mini ive got a message for you to go to the principals office right away
mini is led in by a secretary as detective garson sits in a chair next to principal patty andrews
then things got interesting again
mini immediately sizes up the situation and takes on the appropriate concerned tone
detective garson is everything all right
black and white surveillance tape of one of the schools hallways is seen
mini this tape was shot a week before your mothers death
the door to the nurses office is seen opening and nurse hauptfuhrer walks out
the next day the school nurse reported two bottles of ritalin missing from the medicine cabinet
a few seconds later mini is seen entering the nurses office checking over her shoulder to make sure no one saw her
the tape freezes then fast forwards
mini is seen leaving the office stuffing something in her pocket
a tv and vcr sit on a rolling cabinet in the corner as garson puts down the remote and looks at mini
principal andrews is not pleased
weve lifted two prints from the door and the inside of the medicine cabinet
they dont match the nurse
mini is there something youd like to say to detective garson
mini eyes remain calm
can we see the tape of the der fuhrer sucking down her afternoon fix of smirnoff or dont you have cameras in the bathroom stalls
young lady stealing anything especially prescription drugs is a serious matter
mini looks at andrews her eyes suddenly starting to tear up
you got me okay
but what was i supposed to do
what do you mean
suddenly hysterical she
she said if i didnt she was
was gonna who
she made me steal them for her
i didnt want to but she said she was going to send me to boarding school in canada if i didnt
sobbing the yukon territories
are you happy now
you got me
oh my lord i had know idea she was an addict
detective garson knew
we told him and now what
the whole schools gonna know
mini hides her face in her hands
shes dead my mommys dead
cant we just leave her be
andrews casts a harsh glance at a frustrated garson
detective garson i assume there wont be a need to press charges against ms
mini holds out her wrists to garson
sniffling you gonna cuff me copper
garson looks at mini clearly not convinced of her innocence
shes free to go
martin gets off the elevator and heads across the lobby
garson and a uniformed officer approach him
martin looks a little unnerved to see them
tannen we were just coming up to see you
have you got a minute
detective i told you no more questions without my lawyer
i think youd better call him
martin sits at a table conferring with his lawyer ned volant an impeccably dressed operator with a mane of thick heavily gelled hair
garson sits across from them
theres a small discrepancy that i cant quite figure out and i was hoping you might be able to explain it
i suppose i can try
the final toxicology report came back and your wife definitely didnt die from the pills
she wasnt conscious past but it was the fumes that killed her
well hallelujah thanks for the update martin easy
im sorry but this is harassment
see heres what i needed to ask you
the gas tank in the jag was almost full just a gallon had been used
well if she was unconscious by that means the car must have been running for at least two hours when you found her
an unconscious person cant turn on a car right
detective with all due respect could you get to the point
well heres where i get confused see that particular model idling for two hours will burn at least four gallons of gas
martin tries to remain calm as the panic starts to settle in for a long stay
so theres really no way the tank could be almost full if it was running for two hours
he looks at martin waiting for an answer
so i guess what im asking is whose idea was it to put her in the car
martin dont say anything
tannen you clearly had the most to gain from her death but ive learned from a number of your wifes friends that she and mini had a strained relationship
again detective my client wont be answering anything so lets just cut the cat and mouse
id like mr
tannen to know that if hes trying to be a protective father by covering up something mini did id be careful
the district attorney is viewing this case as an opportunity to show the public that the rich dont get away with murder in this town
martin whispers something in volants ear and he in turn whispers back
does this mean hes offering mr
tannen immunity if he says he was protecting his daughter
garson takes a sip of water as martin anxiously waits for his answer
its a strong possibility
but he wants mr
tannen to know he will go for the maximum sentence if he doesnt
no manslaughter no plea bargains nothing
martins eyes shift slightly
garson now finished with martin sits across from mini and her lawyer herb pelham who doesnt look nearly as confident as martins lawyer
it was colonel mustard in the library with the candlestick
garson smiles at mini admiring her resolve
miss drogues as your lawyer dont wet your pants i know when to shut up and swallow
mini takes out a sip a water letting a trickle of liquid roll down her chin
even garson appears a little intimidated by the overt flirtation
look the fact that the marriage was unhappy and there was no pre nup gives all the motive to martin
so you want me to say it was his idea
if it was his idea give me one reason you should take the fall
at that moment i knew we had him
if he was trying to get me to rat on martin he didnt have enough to charge either one of us
so if i tell the jury it was his idea and i was scared for my life because he said hed kill me if i ever told anyone then i
garson instinctively leans forward in his chair just a bit
mini stares into garsons eyes unflinching
she looks around the room weighing her options
pelham attempts to whisper something in her ear
she waves him off
sorry sport but ill take my chances
mini and martin drive home together
there is an icy chill between them as martin looks over at mini
i never doubted for a minute you were going to hold firm
not a second
i hope you know that
oh i knew
you realize weve got to rely on each other
who else do we have
were almost home free
my lawyer says that gas gauge theory is circumstantial as hell
ive only got one concern now
if a jury knew we were a couple weve both got a motive and that changes everything
mini puts her hand on martins reassuringly
baby dont worry about him hes just jealous cause youve still got rockin abs and a better hairline
martin looks over at her softening
even if he did send that picture what does it prove
mini walks through the mall
for all of martins talk of relying on each other
martin follows about a hundred yards behind
garson had succeeded in planting the seeds of distrust
mini turns around and martin ducks into a boutique
mini walks out of a movie theater with kayla and two boys
our relationship had turned into what some might call
a few seconds later martin walks out of the theater wearing dark glasses and a hat
he follows them
mini sits in front of the tv watching a commercial
she is wearing the same fuct t shirt she wore when we first met her
her eyes are filled with anticipation
something had to give and ironically enough it was the night i was making my television debut
i had asked martin to be home by eight for a big surprise
martin walks in the front door with his briefcase
oh hey come and watch
youre missing me im on tv
hurry up the commercials almost over
martin walks over
comes back on and we see that mini and a male contestant are sitting on either side of this shows mini and her male counterpart are just a bit better
looking than the engaged couple both of whom have a midwestern wholesomeness
martins face turns white
the host turns to the camera
welcome back to absolutely positive
now its time to hear how the date between jason and mini ended
you went on yeah i thought itd be a gas
jason you said that the reason you wanted to come on the show was to test your ability to resist temptation
a bit nervous well since becky and i have dated since high school and decided to remain virgins until marriage i just wanted to go on a date with another
girl just to see how i would react
you know whether thered be any feelings of doubt about my decision
so after dinner what happened
oh gosh well she suggested we go to a dance club she knew
im not really a good dancer but i said yes
hurt we never go dancing
jason smiles at her uncomfortably
so mini is jason a good dancer
well hes a damn quick learner and not just at dancing
martin shoots a look at mini martin for gods sake that was their line
you think i talk like that
so there was some other teacher student stuff going on
uncomfortable uh no not really
oh come on what about when we went back to your place
i i dont know what shes talking about
come on dont be bashful
he put on some soft music and no
this isnt true why are you we started kissing and jason
to mini shut up
but jay jay it was really special
to the host he loves to be called jay jay
let me tell you becky youre in for a wild ride from this bronco
martin staring at mini
did did you
you slept with her
god martin it was a one time thing
he was a virgin how could i say no
believe me shell thank me after their wedding night
you had me come home early to dont be jealous
it wont happen again
it was just a goof
martin stands there speechless while on the screen becky dissolves into a puddle of tears as jason tries to console her
suddenly she runs off stage
martin picks up the remote and hits mute
he let you go on
yeah i thought it would be fun
i wasnt really supposed to you know go all the way but i cant believe you
th that couple you ruined their relationship
excuse me but the show is called absolutely positive for a reason
clearly the only thing jason was positive about was youre a sick little twist you know that
well what does that make you
heading outside i need some air
oh by the way some intern from your office stopped by earlier today with something
its on the desk
martin walks over to the desk and picks up an envelope marked martin tannen
he opens it to find
an x photo of him and mini kissing passionately on the beach in mexico
this time there is no question as to the nature of their relationship
scrawled across the bottom in black marker is remember im just across the fence
martins eyes scan the photo a look of resignation setting in
what is it
martin slowly holds it up for her to see
oh my god
very evenly i think its time i had a little chat with our neighbor no this is exactly what he wants
what if hes working with garson
then he cant blackmail me
wait here ill be right back
martin heads for the back door
no please dont do this
let me go with you
i said wait here
mini jumps up and runs over to him grabbing his wrist
dont do this we can leave tonight
well drive to mexico
martin looks up at her
hell never leave us alone you realize that
let me talk to him he promised me he wouldnt hurt us
a few days ago
you saw him
i went to try and find out what he knew
i spent the afternoon with him m you
spen i was doing it for us
i figured he wouldnt turn us in if i
if i made him think i was
a wave of nausea washes over martins face
and was he
please tell me you didnt
martin looks unconvinced
i just made him think i would so he wouldnt turn us in
when animals attack comes on the tv in the background
sarcastically thank you i appreciate your restraint
id think youd be a little more appreciative
who were you doing it for when you did it with that kid
who was that selfless act for
oh like youre such a martyr for being faithful
it shows amazing restraint to limit yourself to just one stepdaughter
dont lecture me about fidelity
your mother was cheating within six months of the i dos
he heads for the door again
now if youll excuse me
mini grabs him again desperate
please look im sorry i really am but this isnt the answer
martin grabs her wrist forcefully
youre hurting me
through his teeth calm down or ill snap it in two do you hear me
mini nods her head
now i want you to wait here for me
do you understand
mini nods again
softly please dont do this
he lets go and calmly walks towards the sliding doors to the back yard
mini watches him go
martin stands outside and rings the bell
the door opens and rudell stands there in a smoking jacket and pajamas
he looks martin up and down with a self satisfied smile as sinatras nice and easy is playing on his stereo in the background
martin what a surprise how are you
just watched mini on your show
was tonight the night
we taped that two weeks ago
let me tell you i have girls audition all the time for me and
enjoying this she was fucking incredible
rudell watches martins eyes for a reaction
a natural huh
like a duck to water
and totally willing to take direction
martins jaw tightens as rudell is loving twisting the knife in him
i wish all the girls i worked with had her
how can i put this
need to please
you son of a bitch
martin explodes punching rudell in the mouth sending him staggering backwards inside
lets take it nice and easy
mini stands at the window nervously waiting on the phone
she looks out the window at the fight beginning in rudells house
frantic yes hello youve got to send a police car to mira loma lane right away
my fathers gone crazy i think hes going to hurt our neighbor
yes mira loma oh god hurry
rudell struggles to his feet and charges martin shoving him against his wet bar
rudell grabs a glass and smashes it over martins face grinding the glass into his face
hey baby whats your hurry
relax dont you worry
martin screams in agony and throws rudell off him
rudell crashes into a glass coffee table smashing it to pieces
martin tries to pick the glass out of his eyes as rudell gets to his feet and grabs one of metal legs of the shattered coffee table
he rushes martin clubbing him in the head with it
martin crumples to the floor and rudell starts kicking him
martin grabs rudell by the ankles and flips him
the two men grapple on the floor
where are they
what are you talk dont fuck with me
rudell and martin crash through the plate glass window on to the brick patio
martin gets to his feet first and grabs a golf club propped up on a chair next to the putting green
the problem now of course is to simply hold your horses
rudell struggles to his feet just in time to see the pitching wedge heading straight for his ribs
martin catches him square and he goes down like a sack of potatoes
martin starts hitting him with one swing after another
to rush would be a crime
rudell cries out in agony as the blows smash one rib after another
you son of a bitch
hows that feel
you like that
you thought you could have my wife and my daughter too
cause nice and easy does it nice and easy does it
martin bends down and grabs rudells hair twisting his head around so he can look him in the eye
in the distance a siren is heard getting closer
sorry pal shes mine
diane may have taken pity on you between vodkas but not her
martin smashes his face into the patio
rudell lets out a moan grasping at the ground trying to get up but his legs dont obey him
martin stands up and grabs the club raising it with both hands above his head for a final swing
now tell me where they are or i swear to god ill crack your head open
he turns around to see mini tears coming down her cheeks standing ten feet away
the sirens suddenly stop
go look for the negatives
this is insane
we need the negatives
he raises the club again
mini runs for him grabbing his arm before it comes down
youre gonna kill him
he tries to pull the club away
what are you doing
hell tell everyone
martin turns around to see two uniformed officers with their guns drawn
martin looks down at rudell gasping for air his face covered in blood
he looks at his own blood soaked clothes the reality hitting him
drop the club and put your hands up
martin obeys and mini runs into the arms of the second officer
the first one moves quickly to martin and shoves him on the ground
thank god you came
mini you called them
how could you call them
mini buries her face in the officers chest
hes crazy i told him not to
i told him to stop
nice and easy does it
mini emerges from the station with her lawyer as a throng of reporters jostle for a photo
needless to say my appearance on absolutely positive was the most sought after clip in every newsroom in town
tv video footage of mini at martins trial sitting in the front row
the trial was quick
once moms affair with rudell came out the d
realized he had a motive and a slam dunk
he forewoman an elderly hispanic woman casts a harsh eye towards martin and then reads the verdict
martin stares straight ahead showing no emotion as mini sobs behind him
since rudell was in a coma the issue of my relationship with martin was moot
martin realized trying to pin anything on me would probably get him the chair
martin wearing an orange prison uniform is led into a van by a deputy
at his sentencing i begged for leniency
he got off with ten for the attempted murder of rudell and twenty to life for moms death
mini opens the door to find reporters camped on the lawn snapping photos
dozens of bouquets and wreaths are piled up next to the front door
the outpouring of support was amazing
a mailman hauls a bag of sympathy cards to the front door
she leads him inside where he dumps them next to three other bags full
the sun is blistering hot as mini drives martins mercedes convertible with the top down
martins assets were put in a trust for me and since i was eighteen i was allowed to live by myself
she turns down another road at a sign reading lompoc state
mini and martin sit facing each other behind a plexiglas barrier
there are dividers between each phone to provide the prisoners with a little privacy
im sorry i forgot to bring that book you wanted
its okay myou can mail it
are you okay
you look like you havent showered in days
you have to be careful about sh
so hows school
excited youll never guess what happened
i was voted valedictorian
but dont you have to be the best student
but the students took a vote and they said they wanted me to have it for demonstrating remarkable courage in the face of unspeakable loss
smiling sadly i wonder how the real valedictorian feels
like slitting his wrists with the sharp end of a protractor
is rudell out of his coma yet
i dont know why
taken aback mini if he recovers he may try to blackmail you with those pictures
i wouldnt worry about that
but if the d
got those pictures you could im pretty sure he wont be doing anything with them
he looks suddenly very worried
mini youre not thinking of sleeping with him to keep him quiet
because ive met people in here who could help us with him if it comes to that
they know people on the outside we could
pay to make sure he doesnt try to take advantage of you
oh gosh thats so romantic
its like youre a real life criminal with connections and everything but im a little surprised you havent figured it out yet
minis eyes glint ever so slightly as she examines martins face almost as if hes an animal at the zoo
wow like i thought you were just playing along cause im your only link to the outside world but you really dont know
martin furrows his brow confused
rudell didnt send those pictures
he suddenly becomes very still as minis lips curl in a thin smile
you remember aurelio
martin looks at her blankly
our cabana boy from mexico
suddenly it hits him
he looks almost nauseous
what a sweetie i thought i might have to fuck him but just giving him the camera was enough
his knuckles tighten around the phone
it was pretty clear garson wasnt gonna give up and sooner or later hed find enough to charge us
it just seemed ridiculous that wed both end up suffering
martins jaw tightens as his pupils go black
oh come on you wouldve done it if you thought of it first
you know im right
the veins start to bulge in his arm holding the phone
suddenly switching gears hey listen since conjugal visits are pretty much out of the question i thought it would be cool if we tried a little prison phone sex
martin stares at her taking deep steady breaths
they dont tap these lines do they
looking around i think i might even be able to open my blouse without anyone seeing
are you sure
i wont be able to come back for a few weeks
mock jealous wait have you met someone in here
why you old dog
i knew you wouldnt be single in here for long
a prison guard appears behind martins stall
she did it
she just admitted it
it was her idea
i guess this means i could start dating around too
dont let her leave
get the warden
okay thats enough
the guard moves to take the phone from him
martin clutches it to his head
you little whore
starting to cry daddy why are you saying those things
the guard struggles to rip the phone away but martin holds on for dear life
im gonna kill you
do you hear me you little bitch
sobbing daddy stop
i love you
dont say that
i love you
finally the guard smashes martin with a billy club sending him sprawling on the floor
martin screams behind the glass but cannot be heard as the guard hog ties him and drags him away by his feet
seniors in gowns sit awaiting their diplomas as parents sit in the audience fanning themselves with programs
mini stands at the dais addressing the class
as many of you know the past few months of my life have been very difficult
i dont know how i would have gotten through it without all of you
i really think it is a testament to the love in this institution that i stand before you today as the first straight c student in school history voted valedictorian
a few cheers go up from the rowdier students
again to marvin tepperman the real valedictorian he deserved this and i want to wish him a speedy recovery
i spoke to his doctors today and they say with medication and therapy marvin should be able to attend harvard this fall
a polite smattering of applause is heard
while i may not have excelled in the classroom i think my recent experiences in that bigger schoolhouse we call life have taught me a few lessons that id like
to share with my fellow graduates
her classmates instinctively lean forward a little to listen
follow your heart and dont question it now matter where it tells you to go
trust me itll open up a world of new experiences you cant even imagine
principal andrews nods in approval
but as you listen to it dont forget your family your parents
dont forget theyre people too and while we may not always agree with them remember to love them when they need love
a few parents look almost surprised to hear positive things said about them
voice breaking and i mean really love them dont just pay them lip service
really do it
whenever you can
holding back tears
i know i did and i just wish my dad could be here today so after this speech i could just walk down into the audience and give him my
love right here
in front of all of you
thank you and good luck
mini puts her speech down gently sobbing as the audience erupts
principal andrews moves quickly to console her
like i promised no prom night highjinks no nerds becoming popular no shakespeare shoved up your ass
minis fellow graduates give her a standing ovation
a few parents become misty eyed
and in case youre feeling guilty about having no one to identify with but me relax
mini looks out across the crowd and a huge smile ripples across her face as she waves to everyone in the golden sunlight
theres a first time for everything
