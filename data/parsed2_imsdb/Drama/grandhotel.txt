written by bela balazs based on the play menschen im hotel by vicki baum american version by william a
season is march
action of the picture takes place in approximately hours
picture commences at approximately in the day
time the present
show general natural action of people going in and people coming out but in it is the definite inference of people arriving and people leaving the big hotel
move inside through the revolving door very quickly
camera pauses on the threshold like a human being seeing and hearing
dissolve into clock
it is twenty minutes to one and then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid day business jumble
camera pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the steps that lead up to the restaurant
in its journey it passes kringelein looking up
he is not pointed
the camera then saunters getting a slow profile movement across near senfs desk
senf is very busy
the camera now passes profile the desk of senf
senf stands before his background of slots and keys
we proceed until we are facing the elevator
at that moment the elevator is opening
among the people who emerge is suzette who moves too quickly for us to distinguish who she is
the camera pans quickly with her and in the distance we hear her saying to senf madam grusinskaya will not want her car
this line is only just above the general clatter of action but it is picked up sharply first by senf then by bell captain and as the camera slowly turns
around we see the boy going towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance saying cancel madam grusinskayas car
the camera now backs away from the scene into the bar
it backs to the back of the bar and proceeds in profile behind the backs of the barmen
a mixed crowd of people drinking before their lunch
we pick up the doctor leaning his head upon his hands looking into space
the woman next to him a noisy blonde is laughing
the doctor glances up at her she glances at the doctor
she and the audience see the scarred side of his face the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to her companion who is the baron
we do not get much of a chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at his watch his shoulders are turning away from the camera and
he moves out towards the lobby
back up a few feet and lap dissolve as you move into the main aisle of busy room in restaurant
great activity of waiters
the bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime
a string orchestra is playing
among other things we pick up the smiling face of the pompous maitre dhotel he has apparently just shown someone important to a table
the camera watches his face and follows him
his face just as camera reaches service table
the pompous maitre dhotel now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter where is that gentlemans soup
the waiter frightened and perspiring doesnt bother to argue he tears off quickly camera following him to another service table
the waiter seizes buss boys arm wheres that soup
boy goes off at great rate of speed camera follows him into service room of kitchen
boy stops at soup chefs counter
he is not the only waiter wanting soup at that moment
he pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket forward
quick come on come on
the soup chef used to impatient waiters makes no exception of the young man
he looks at him as much as to say ill slap you on the mouth
at the same time he is pulling over a cauldron of soup
cauldron of soup being pulled over it dislodges a small cauldron that is near the edge
we see the soup fall and hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face she has been scalded
general steamy confusion
the chef has filled the plate
we proceed the buss boy out
half way down the aisle the waiter takes it from him
the camera follows the waiter who places the soup before mr
preysing has been waiting with his serviette carefully tucked in his collar
his spoon is in his hand
a horrible man ready for action
the soup is in front of him he tastes it pushes it away frowns we feel he is going to tear the place down
anxious voice yes
near preysings elbow mr
in same voice yes
telephone from fredersdorf preysing rises struts from restaurant
camera follows him he walks out through the door
between two operators heads
odd effect at board
camera tilts up as preysings head looks right down at girl
bellboy is with preysing
preysing from fredersdorf his call
preysing preysing begins drumming his fingers on the top of switchboard
nervously theyve gone just a moment sir
to boy you told me it was on you said the call was through
he waits irritably to first whos in number three

at the conclusion of senfs speech camera moves to next booth
thru the glass door we see preysing approaching from desk

suzette is already in the booth and she is waiting for mr
meierheim to come on

theres music here all day long
and in the evening they go around in full dress
yes sometimes i have pain but i can stand it
everything is frightfully expensive here
you can imagine the grand hotel
near the conclusion of kringeleins speech we see the doctor approaching through kringeleins booth
he is looking down at something
doctor is looking down at parcel
kringeleins voice on same track
camera backs up
show doctor as he passes various booths voices of respective people come up sharply
im a sick man heinrich hello hello operator every minute two marks ninety
doctor passes barons booth next

doctor passes suzettes booth
madam is afraid she will never dance again there was no applause last night doctor passes preysings booth
yes the merger manchester it is my business as much as yours weve already lost eighty five thousand doctor passes senfs booth
im on duty i cant leave the grand hotel its like being in prison the baby doctor crosses to telephone operator to operator any calls
half to himself grand hotel people coming going
nothing ever happens
showing electric sign odd angle the grand hotel unlighted
small section engineer pulling down lever
sign flashes on
shooting directly on swinging door normal crowd action
tea dansant at this hour is daily rendezvous for smart demi mondaines gigolos out of town travelers etc
these types indicated
in the distance we hear music
this same music is being played by the eastman jazz band in the yellow room of the hotel
the camera does not wait but backs down the room
it is the hour of the tea dansant
as the camera is backing out of the room which is in reality the restaurant converted the tall figure of the baron he proceeds through the door of the restaurant
note question here as to whether yellow room will be the restaurant converted or not
in which case it will be necessary to add scene of baron walking through corridor upstairs giving sense of distance
the baron is whistling the tune of the orchestra he proceeds through the lobby as if on a mission
he glances at a pretty woman who passes and nods good evening to the doctor who is seated in his chair not far from the desk
pretty girl is there she has seen him coming
she turns from the door and hands him a box of orchids already tied in ribbon
good little girl nice ones
the baron would stay and flirt but he has a mission he leaves
in the lobby we pick up the baron leaving the florists with small box of flowers he crosses quickly to senfs desk
shot over senfs head as the baron puts the flowers down
senf is busy
the baron is whistling gaily tapping his fingers on the flower box he is good natured and patient
to clerk as telephone bell rings is that for me
no madam grusinskayas car is to be brought
he replaces the receiver to one of the bellboys madam grusinskayas car is to be brought
we hear his voice out of scene at the door
madam grusinskayas car
to be brought
good evening baron
amiably good evening
will you send these up to madam grusinskaya
he hands the box of flowers to the clerk madam grusinskaya
clerk hands box to bellboy
room one seventy madam grusinskaya
to senf have you my tickets for the theatre
oh yes baron to clerk baron von gaigerns seats for madam grusinskaya
telephone rings again
clerk picks it up
to clerk for me
at telephone shakes his head no madam grusinskayas car is not to be brought
to boy madam grusinskayas car is not to be brought
the clerk hands senf the tickets which senf hands to the baron
as the baron is picking up his tickets he looks around quickly as he hears the voice of pimenov who has arrived apparently from his afternoon walk from the rehearsal
at the theatre
to senf good evening my key one sixty eight
good evening mr
oh good evening baron
hows the beautiful lady
grusinskaya well to tell the truth baron tonight we are a little bit nervous
were you at the theatre last night
certainly always when grusinskaya dances
well last night was not so good
i thought she was splendid
yes but the audience
at that moment they are interrupted by a vehement little japanese with his wife
they are arguing with the clerk
the japanese speaks in japanese to his wife
to japanese the parquot loges are behind the parquet chairs
then theyve put me back and i want to be up in front
how is that chairs in front of loges
senf is speaking to a lady at the same time
the train leaves at seven thirty madam
that is the only through train the dining car goes along
the baron and pimenov exchange glances as the little japanese speaks volubly to his wife
sarcastically its always so quiet here
if you occupied the room next to madam grusinskaya you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby
my dear sir i would gladly change rooms with you
effeminately no doubt you would baron
but do you know im quite indispensable to her
im her ballet master and her nurse
i hardly belong to myself anymore
but there you are its grusinskaya you cant help adoring her
at that moment zinnowitz pushes past them
addressing senf is mr
preysing in i am doctor zinnowitz
to bellboy mr
preysing from fredersdorf quickly paging mr
preysing preysing steps quickly into scene
here you are doctor zinnowitz
have i kept you waiting
waiting im waiting for news from manchester
no news yet
everything depends on the manchester merger
i know i know
i saw gerstenkorn at lunch and as your lawyer i made it my business to broach the matter as they begin to move out of scene zinnowitz calls back to
im expecting a young woman a stenographer she will ask for mr
ask her to wait
yes doctor zinnowitz
as they move out of scene telephone bell goes
to clerk for me
no letters to two eighty
to clerk if a young woman a stenographer etc
this just covers the scene
the baron and pimenov are laughing at something one of them has said which brings our attention to them again
at that moment the doctor enters the scene
anyone asked for me
the doctor turns slowly away taking out a cigarette with his one hand
glancing at doctor the war
looking up from his letter glances off at the doctor that is doctor otternschlag you know him
yes he always seems to be waiting for something and nothing ever comes
the war dropped him here and forgot him
beams yes i was in the war
he turns as he hears the baron say this
he pulls at his cigarette and looks grimly at the baron
then he looks off at kringelein who is trying to get rohnas attention the reception clerk at the reception desk which adjoins that of senfs
please please pay some attention to me i have no time
pan back to desk engaged with a lady and gentleman who have just arrived if you will wait one moment sir
i wont wait i cant wait i waited three days before i got a room at all and what a room that is
its a very nice room and inexpensive sir
did i say i wanted a cheap room to live in when i came here did i ask for a cheap room
rohna sensing a scene with this strange dirty little gentleman looks furtively around for the manager
just one moment sir
no i wont wait i cant every day is precious every hour every minute
second clerk is looking straight at him
kringelein turns his attention directly to this man and proceeds i came here because i wanted to live here two weeks maybe three god only knows ive told you ill
pay ill pay anything you ask
im tired im ill i cant wait
as he finishes the doctor draws into the scene he is watching
assistant manager enters
has the gentleman a complaint
rohna and kringelein speak together
the gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty nine
i certainly have a complaint and a fair one
he senses an audience and warms up
the baron and pimenov enter the scene
the lady and gentleman have turned
the bellboy stands watching curiously and even senf pauses and looks up
continuing i came here from a long distance to stay at the grand hotel
i want a room a big room like you would give general director preysing im as good as mr
preysing i can pay like mr
preysing would you give him a little room way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going bang bang bang
he bangs at the desk with his fist this gentleman can have my room
send his bags up to my room
oh but i youre tired
i can see that
yes yes i am tired
i have been ill
you are ill
during this scene the manager has been talking with rohna quietly
the manager how turns
kringelein will take room number one seventy six one of our most expensive rooms
it is large and on the front with bath
subdued exhausted does that mean that the bath is my own
well now thats very kind thanks
thats what i want a large room on the front with a private bath yes thats what i want
i can pay now if you like
he takes out his wallet and nervously commences to extract money
that will not be necessary
the manager is instructing the bellboy to take kringelein to the new room
kringelein accidentally drops a bill the baron who has noticed the money stoops to pick it up
in bending himself kringelein drops his hat
baron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it with his sleeve
thank you sir
amused not at all sir
he beams finding a friendly face permit me my name is kringelein from fredersdorf
im baron von gaigern
oh a baron
he is impressed baron catches the mood of making this gentleman suddenly popular
and this is doctor otternschlag
turning to doctor oh doctor you are a doctor i am i know i know when a mans collar is an inch too big for him i know he is
yes oh oh yes his finger goes nervously to his collar zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out
at that moment pimenov returns from the news stand where he has bought the evening papers
well baron i must go and dress
to doctor is this gentleman a baron too
laughing unfortunately no
the manager comes into scene
kringelein kindly register
kringelein turns to the desk
the doctor turns up with him
at that moment the barons chauffeur touches his arm
have you a minute now
no i told you not to come in this lobby
times getting short
ive told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth
chauffeur takes the cigarette out of his mouth but still holds it in his hand
i want to speak not now
the baron leaves
general moving off towards elevator of baron pimenov kringelein and the doctor
on another shot shooting profile onto senfs desk bring in flaemmchen
her back to camera
we hear her ask mr
will you wait please
the stenographer is to go up mr
preysing one sixty four
thanks calling off to elevator heigh
she crosses to elevator
as she enters the elevator and the gate shuts she turns around back pressed against the baron who is looking down at her
the look on her face is the look we often see on flaemmchens in elevators when they are pressed
note good introduction for flaemmchen
the lift ascends
flaemmchen steps out of the lift
she is looking around for the numbers
she moves out of scene
the doctor kringelein and the bellboy with the bag move straight down the hall
pimenov is chatting volubly
to baron poor grusinskaya how can she receive anyone
she cant theatre trains hotels hotels trains theatre
we see flaemmchen being directed by the floor clerk to mr
continuing i must go and dress shell be waking up and calling for me
he proceeds up the passage pompously humming the air of his ballet
at that moment flaemmchen who has been directed to preysings door by floor clerk passes the baron and there is an amusing exchange of glances between them
flaemmchen knocking at preysings door hears a voice
she opens the door
preysing has had a bath and is actually steaming from it
he stands before a long mirror rubbing himself with a towel
he sees her through the mirror wraps the towel around him very cutely for a big man and turns upon her
im the stenographer
then you will please wait outside
he is very much affronted
flaemmchen who has seen many large gentlemen in the altogether lightly dont hurry take your time
she goes out of the room and shuts the door
flaemmchen emerges from preysings room
baron loitering in the hall
whistling as outlined
baron approaches he is also whistling the same tune that flaemmchen is whistling
she glances at him as he continues whistling with an amusing dance step as much as to say are you mad
not with strangers
baron glances back up the passage it is apparent that he is going to make conversation here with this girl in order to keep legitimately in the passage until grusinskaya
turning to flaemmchen never
youre a fool
yes i am rather
he glances down the passage again his hands in his pockets
she glances impatiently at her watch
he must be very nice
gallantly whoever is keeping you waiting
indicating preysings door have you seen it
oh my large and noisy neighbor really
indicating preysings door that
with meaning you
quickly oh work
with meaning oh
she twittles her fingers you know
if you were free id ask you to come and have some tea but tea would spoil my dinner
lightly one meal a day id hate to spoil it
she turns invitingly no why
lord no charming but why one meal a day
laughing in his face money ever heard of it
yes yes indeed but you are a
moves fingers a stenographer
dont little stenographers earn little pennies
did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on
one that shed bought herself
poor child enthusiastically i wish i were free tonight we could with invitation arent you
free glancing up passage unfortunately no to bad tomorrow though
what time tomorrow
shall we say five oclock downstairs
yellow room where they dance business youre very funny with great meaning yes
flaemmchen laughs at him
slowly all right
at that moment we hear kringeleins voice calling from his doorway at the end of the passage
baron oh baron
the baron turns and looks off at kringelein is in his door in the distance radiant
if i could trouble the baron to come and see this beautiful room
i have ordered champagne
perhaps the baroness could join us
waiter oh waiter
wait a minute
to baron and flaemmchen we are having caviar its expensive but that makes no difference i see the baroness is laughing
have caviar if you like but it tastes like herring to me
at that moment grusinskayas door opens suddenly and suzette comes out into the hall
madam is asleep
by this time the others are entering kringeleins room
the baron turns back for a moment
calling back quietly to suzette asleep
suzette turns back into the room
it is typical hotel
half open trunks etc
curtains are drawn room is in semi darkness
there is a sense of silence except for distant music coming from the yellow room below
in suzettes hands we see one of grusinskayas ballet slippers which she has been mending
she is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops suddenly and looks off dramatically at
shot from her angle
she is sleeping beneath a chinese robe on the chaise lounge
apparently she has changed her position because the hand which is outside the robe moves
the camera as though it were suzette moves up towards grusinskaya
her eyes are closed
suzette crosses to the chaise lounge and is looking down
grusinskayas eyes open suddenly
she looks at the ceiling and then her eyes turn and look straight at suzette
quietly and reverently almost a whisper madam has slept well
no i have been awake thinking thinking
it is time for the performance
it is time
like a soldier called to attention grusinskaya sits suddenly upright always the performance every day the performance time for the performance
she pauses and droops suddenly i think suzette i have never been so tired in my life
she takes the bottle of veronal which is nearby veronal didnt even help me to sleep
laughs a little speaking into telephone madam grusinskayas car is to be brought
while she is speaking grusinskaya rises with the grace of a dancer she picks up the chinese robe that has fallen to the floor and although there is only one
other woman in the room she holds the robe around her
she crosses to the mirror and looks at her face running her fingers through her hair
she gently massages under her eyes and the camera sees grusinskaya for the first time
there is silence in the room neither of the women speak
suzette gets madams clothes ready
she crosses puts the case of pearls down on the dressing table and opens them
grusinskaya looks into space silence dead silence
suzette kneels as if to put madams stockings on for her
grusinskaya pulls her foot away
i cant dance tonight it will pass it will pass come
let us cancel the engagement
cannot do that
now is the time to cancel to stop entirely
i feel it everything tells me enough enough
she leans forward against the dressing table and her hands unconsciously touch the pearls
very quietly the peals are cold everything is cold finished it seems so far away so threadbare the russians st
petersburg the imperial court the grand duke sergei long pause as though she were reliving incidents of the past sergei dead grusinskaya its all gone
she throws the pearls away down upon the floor
mon dieu the pearls if they were to break the pearls wont break they hold together and bring me bad luck i hate them
suzette crosses replacing the pearls
orchids come again madam no card i think perhaps they are from the same young man he is at the end of the corridor tall he walks like a soldier
madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us
last night for instance oh suzette suzette sshh quiet
grusinskayas eyes are looking off into space she is away in russia she does not look telephone rings suzette crosses to telephone
ah oui the car is here for madam
send it away i shant need it
there is a knock at the door a certain kind of knock
she picks up the telephone and as she does so pimenov enters
suzette quickly gives pimenov a signal that there is trouble
as pimenov is closing the door we hear grusinskaya speak into telephone
authoritatively madam grusinskaya will not require her car no she will not be going to the theatre
she turns pimenov at heart a clown makes a grand comedy bow
he will deliberately try to tease madam out of her mood
she glances at him without smiling crosses to the dressing table and sits
it is time for the performance
under her breath the performance the performance the performance
during this scene the orchids fall to the floor it is a hysterical out burst
it is not a woman who is just temperamental it is something deeper than that
she is very near a nervous breakdown
we the audience must feel with her a revulsion against the word performance
tenderly as he touches her shoulder gently poor little lisevata she still has her stage frights it will pass
pimenov kneels by grusinskaya he is chafing her hands he attempts to soothe her
now grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away
it is not stage fright its something more tenderly what what is it
there was no applause
quickly there was there was
that theatre half empty dancing for those few i was frantic i finished the last beat and
she reclines her head as the swan finishing the dance i waited i listened but the applause didnt come nothing
a man in the box and just the claques behind it is passed pimenov
we are dead its finished
there is a sudden knocking at the door
meierheim the door opens suddenly
meierheim bursts into the room
what is this that you have cancelled your car
who am i that i should wait like a fool at the door
and here on a whim you cancel your car
have you forgotten there is a performance
do you know the time
or are we all mad
am i your manager
have we a contract
have we obligations
am i blind
glances at his watch or is that the time
im cancelling the engagement
business of pimenov signaling to him
madam is cancelling the engagement
madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke
ha ha ha hurry come on
tonight theres a line in front of the theatre since six oclock
the house is jammed to the roof
the house is not full is it really full
packed to the ceiling
hurry get dressed
and what an audience the french ambassador american millionaires princess ratzville er er to suzette oh but it cant be
oh come madam please come
she holds up her frock changed mood all right suzette quickly hurry
we will wait
you are late
meierheim goes over to telephone he picks up receiver and says tell madam grusinskayas chauffeur to bring the car
show few feet of grusinskaya getting dressed
pimenov and meierheim
meierheim is pushing the bell
how is the house
after this no more ballets for me
jazz snaps his fingers just jazz
if the house is empty again i dont know when she gets her paint on and hears the music shell be all right
i know these people
they are walking towards kringeleins room
they are pacing rather like men who walk the deck on a liner
they turn almost together but when they turn back past the camera the camera proceeds on into kringeleins room
the camera enters the room to a burst of laughter
champagne bottles open caviar smoke etc
in the room are the doctor kringelein the baron flaemmchen and a very fat waiter comedian
you may laugh
caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you but to me they mean a great deal
you see im ill and all of a sudden i got a fear of missing life
i dont want to miss life do you understand
you are funny
you speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch
yes and for me its going to leave at any minute
the baron offers flaemmchen a glass of champagne
she shakes her head
im sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste distinctive dont you think
velvet upholstery a number one
im in the textile trade and i know
he has a slight case of hiccups from the champagne
he touches the drapes and these are real silk drapes
amusedly silk think of that silk they are too
who hasnt stopped talking have you seen the bathroom
hot and cold running water you see i can get a bath whenever i like
at that moment preysings voice is heard calling to the floor clerk
flaemmchen hearing this turns and looks off apparently through the door
her manner changes she puts down her glass
her masters voice
turns to baron i must go now goodbye thanks
oh dont go
im engaged for the evening
oh can anyone engage you for the evening
to take dictation a mr
preysing to baron goodbye you tomorrow at five oclock
she is moving out kringeleins optimism has left him for a moment he stands looking out of door undecided he is drooped suddenly as though years had returned to him
whats the matter mr
to himself general director preysing
possibly he turns to baron baron when i was sixteen years old i started as an office boy in that mans factory then you know him
do i know him i know him through and through
they start to leave
oh gentlemen please dont go
i must i hope to see you again mr
you will stay doctor if you have nothing better to do
i have nothing better to do mr
they move into the room
no scenes and sequence omitted from original script
pimenov and meierheim are standing there
meierheim is pushing the elevator button
the baron stands near and pauses he is now a changed man
he looks off as he hears the voice of grusinskaya off in the distance
grusinskayas voice hurry suzette
shot from the barons angle
grusinskaya is sweeping down the corridor followed by suzette
perhaps you could present me now mr
please baron forgive me not now here she is
grusinskaya sweeps into scene
the baron leans forward quickly and pushes the bell with a glance at her
they look at each other
he fixes his eyes on her characteristically
she glances at him
this is the first time they have met in the picture
she is impatient
as if to break an awkward silence she turns to suzette
suzette is carrying the coat over the pearls
as she takes the coat off her arm grusinskaya glances down at the jewel case
suzette i told you not to bring the pearls
i will not wear them tonight
take them back suzette
you havent time
suzette toddles off with the pearls
the elevator opens collects its passengers all except the baron and descends
a shot of grusinskayas eyes as she goes down glancing up
a shot of the reverse of him looking down
the baron pauses hesitates thinks
we are interested in his action
for the first time he becomes furtive
music swells up from the yellow room
a great deal of noise confusion and activity as the elevator stops to emit grusinskaya followed by pimenov meierheim and some other people who are rather excited to be in
the elevator with the great grusinskaya
off scene the car for madam grusinskaya
the bellboy hears it and passes the word around
it seems to be echoed through the lobby
people turn as grusinskayas spirit seems to rise with the attention she is getting
the camera precedes her through the revolving door as she sweeps outside of the hotel
the barons chauffeur schweinke is seen to watch her go
he looks furtively around and enters the hotel
as he watches suzette returning from grusinskayas room
she is about to push lift button then decides to run downstairs
zinnowitz and preysing are standing by door
no news from manchester yet do you think we ought to postpone the conference
good heavens no
thatd create the very worst impression
you must be optimistic
you must convince them
you know as well as i do that the merger must go through
yes the merger must go through but i am used to making my deals on a solid basis
i am not a liar
i am an honest business man a good husband and father i have a sense of honor i have nothing to conceal
i couldnt live happily otherwise

we agreed that the merger with the saxonia people must go through
i want to dictate my statement for tomorrow

i like to have things down before me in black and white
ill see you in the morning then at the conference
everythingll be all right preysing
we hear the distant voice of preysing and the keys of the typewriter rattling
the reason for the blackness is that preysings back is flat into the camera
his hands are behind his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly
it is an odd effect
we dont know quite what it is
both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages
preysing moves forward showing that we are in preysings room
the change of light shows us plainly the time lapse
flaemmchen is seated at a small table typing
preying strides forward as he strides he says moreover repeating moreover preysing paces the room
repeating moreover he pauses thinking
picks up telephone quickly into telephone is there a telegram for me yet
oh when it does send it up
during this flaemmchen who is tired sits back and rubs her fingers that have been over worked
she glances at her wrist watch
preysing comes and stands behind flaemmchen
now where was i
he looks over the sheet in her typewriter accidentally his arm touches her neck oh sorry
he puts his cigar in his mouth and walks away
as he walks away where was i
as he turns he catches a down shot on her from behind as she stretches back showing her busts
seeing his face looking down on her she pulls herself together and seats herself at attention
it seems a silly kind of lull
do you work in justice zinnowitz office
no only occasional jobs
she yawns suddenly tired
you pay me
youre a very unusual stenographer moreover
as he paces the room it is obvious that he is trying to collect his thoughts she looks at him waits a moment and then begins characteristically to change the
sheet of paper
i dont see why its unusual for a stenographer to be pretty if she does her work well seems so silly
i dont know why they dont like girls like me in offices
personally i hate offices id much rather be in the movies
yes i photograph very well
look she tosses magazine as if it were nothing at all over to him
he looks down at it without touching it
what is this
i got ten marks for that
he picks it up
without looking up me
as he looks at picture he lowers his voice two notes
reading only in mutual advantages moreover
what brown hands you have
thats from skiing
he holds her hands natural unabashed yes
a man i know took me to switzerland last month
he drops her hand suddenly
that must have been nice for him
reading only in mutual advantages moreover
preysing paces the room trying to get his thoughts back to the work in hand
he was a lucky man that man
she waits at attention he paces back and forth again
dont misunderstand me
im a married man with grownup daughters
uh moreover do you mind if i smoke
she takes cigarette i went to florence once too
with the same friend
by this time she is smoking her cigarette
without looking at him no
quickly moreover the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the manchester cotton company
not too quickly
youre a little too fast
cant you understand me
i understand you perfectly
have you got it now
typing cotton company should throw a great weight into the balance
as he turns his back looks at him significantly weight into the balance
there is a sudden knock at the door
boy enters with telegram
telegram for mr
with almost hysterical speed preysing snatches the telegram opens it
flaemmchen powders her nose
it is bad news
he wipes the perspiration from his forehead
he throws the telegram away from him onto her desk
paces the room
flaemmchen believing the telegram to be something that she must copy picks it up quite naturally and reads it
deal with manchester cotton company definitely off
preysing turns and snatches the telegram from her
preysing paces the room with the telegram
flaemmchen rises stretches
quite naturally she glances at the pictures on preysings dressing table
how nice your daughters
my daughters yes my daughters
he is talking more to himself is that mrs
to himself definitely off
oh too bad
did you quarrel
she is looking at picture of mrs
preysing turns speaks quickly definitely thatll be all be here tomorrow at nine oclock
he turns goes out onto balcony with telegram flaemmchen delighted and with alacrity crosses piles up her papers and is prepared to leave
trim flaemmchen out of preysings room
take her down to elevator
at the same time camera pans over and shows the barons chauffeur knocking at the barons door
calling come in
trim the chauffeur into the barons room
baron is busy changing his clothes
chauffeur steps in he closes the door behind him and stands there with an inquisitive look
you are late the dancers gone to the theatre
very nonchalantly well
shes gone to the theatre dont you know
very nonchalantly yes
ready to explode and what are you going to do
the pearls are in her room
threateningly now listen to me
the others are getting suspicious of you
i was on the telephone to amsterdam today they think youre scared
ive been careful ive been waiting my chance
youve been waiting your chance
youre too much of a gentleman thats the trouble with you
i told you ill get the pearls tonight
need any help
have you got that skeleton key
he takes the skeleton key out of his pocket and produces it to the baron
the floor clerk is out there in the corridor she sees everything contemptuously i could take care of her
chloroform on a handkerchief from behind while you
no no no no
poor girl chloroform would give her a rotten headache
i know i had it in the war
besides shes very pretty not young but youre no good for this business
its just a joke to you
swings suddenly on him i dont like your tone
comes up to him face to face no baron is suddenly seized with uncontrollable temper twists his wrists backs him to door speaks quietly
get out and leave it to me
be ready to leave on the night train for amsterdam
with the pearls
with the pearls the chauffeur leaves
the moment he is gone baron looks the door business ad lib
crosses to window
the baron peeps out onto balcony it seems to be clear
he proceeds along and peeps into preysings room
preysing is apparently in the bathroom
baron skips nimbly past the room
working at thrill of pass through to grusinskayas room
baron is pretty shaken by jump
darkness light from transom and building opposite
business of finding key and getting pearls
intercut preysing coming out onto his balcony bringing out with him loud speaker of radio which announces noisily as follows you are listening to the music of the eastman jazz
band in the famous yellow room of the grand hotel
baron starts suddenly when he hears voice and with pearls in his hand looks cautiously out of window only to see preysing seating himself upon his balcony radio loud speaker
possibly preysing commences dinner scene bullying waiter
the baron knows he is trapped if he jumps onto preysings balcony preysing is the man that will cause the alarm
quickly he moves across the room tries the door it is locked securely
he looks for skeleton key and then remembers refusing it from the chauffeur
he is trapped in an absurd way
as he moves back from the door he knocks the telephone off of the table
he watches it for a moment realizing that the operator must now know that there is someone in grusinskayas room
he picks up the telephone replaces the receiver wipes finger prints off with his handkerchief
he is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring suddenly
the thought crosses his mind they they will want to know who is in the room
he lets the telephone ring
crosses to the door again
above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaids voice singing an absurd song
she is coming in
the key turns in the door
quickly he hides behind the curtains
slowly and amusingly the chambermaid tired and dragging enters the room
he is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door
after all this maid should be an easy person to get around
we have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door
the chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear from preysings radio
the telephone commences ringing
chambermaid does not answer it but continues her duties
at last because of the noise of the telephone she picks it up and speaks
no no there is no one here
she replaces the receiver at that moment the inspectress a large stout woman appears at the open door
to chambermaid youre late
what have you been doing
grumbling everyone all the time says come back come back
they wont get out of their rooms
the inspectress in a very businesslike way proceeds around the room coming nearer and nearer the baron
she is looking at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork looking for dust
she tries the door to the next room to see if it is locked
telephone bell rings again
inspectress picks it up quickly
no madame grusinskaya is not here
the western theater
suddenly out of scene we hear the voice of suzette
suzette is calling out to the night clerk in the passage
have you seen madame
replying isnt she at the theatre
suzette comes in and hurries to telephone
hello hello mr
pimenov have they found her
no she is not here
yes im at the hotel
with the baron watching
during this action the inspectress has waven the chambermaid out of the room
business ad lib
meierheim enters he has heard the word pimenov on the telephone he takes the receiver from suzette
into telephone pimenov
no i havent found her
is desprez dancing
how is it
oh all right
keep the show going
bangs down receiver wait till i see her shell pay for this this little trick is going to cost grusinskaya a suit for breach of contract
madame is ill her nerves
what about my nerves
who is she anyway
where does she think she is russia
those days have passed
he turns and sees grusinskaya standing at the door
she is in costume very pale very beautiful
her coat over one shoulder is ragging she lets it drop and moves slowly into the center of the room
her hair dressed for the dance make up is on her face she is breathless
i want to be alone
the other women in the room draw out leaving suzette to pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor
where have you been
should i does madame wish
suzette please go i want to be alone
suzette obediently crosses to door and pauses on threshold waiting for meierheim
meierheim approaches grusinskaya
i suppose i can cancel the vienna engagement
i wish to be alone
youll be very much alone my dear madame
this is the end
he stamps out suzette with a frightened look through the door closes it on meierheims exit
it is some time before grusinskaya moves
she crosses to door turns the key takes the key out of the lock and throws it away from her out upon the floor
she crosses slowly to the mirror regards herself silently
we hear the strains from preysings radio playing a light viennese waltz
grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob
quite suddenly as if with resolution she begins to undress
then she becomes weary again
with a garment in her hand she moves slowly toward the curtain where the baron is standing
we see him tense himself
she drops the garment listlessly to the floor moves out of scene
he peeps around the curtains
she is in a thin robe
she sits before mirror looks steadily at her face
her head goes down suddenly in her hands and we hear her say the end over finished suddenly she moves quickly across the room
goes to bathroom
baron half starts out toward door
he watches darts across the room as if towards the door
he hears her coming and darts quickly into the half open door of the closet
she re enters carrying a glass of water
she crosses places the glass down beside the bed her movements are quick and furtive then she crosses picks up the telephone asks for the theatre
the western theatre she leaves receiver down crosses quickly to mirror stands there and brushes back her hair crosses back to telephone speaks western theatre
she glances up at the clock
the stage mr
pimonov the ballet master
grusinskaya hurry hurry
again she puts the receiver down picking up a pencil she commences hastily to scribble a note
she writes frantically
her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver
yes yes im waiting
she finishes the note commences suddenly to speak into the telephone hello pimenov
im at the hotel
i couldnt go on i couldnt
no no dont long pause just alone
good night good night my dear goodbye
pimenov how is it going badly
oh and how is it
oh oh i see they didnt miss me
they didnt miss me
she lets her hand drop with the receiver and goes on talking into the air they didnt miss me good night pimenov
she is about to replace the receiver
she sits with it in her hand unreplaced
the music has stopped
the room is strangely silent
behind her the baron peers from the closet
her head sinks down upon her hands
a funny singing noise comes from the telephone
she lifts the receiver to her ear
in a very strange voice the voice of opehlia she speaks with great humility oh im sorry yes
i have finished
she replaces the receiver the foregoing scene is much better played than described
it is in fact ballet
quite calmly grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table
she folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the table or hangs it over the telephone
she crosses to the window pulls back the curtains the baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before
we see the baron watching
he glances at the door quickly
no there is not time
she is returning calmly
she crosses to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer
she looks at it thoughtfully her lips are trembling a little
she moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth
she sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded hands which contain the veronal she seems to pray
the baron comes from the closet now is his chance he looks at the door but cant make it
looks on the floor for the key which grusinskaya has previously thrown there his eyes fall upon the note on the telephone he reads it
it is a death farewell note to suzette do not insert it
at this moment she has finished the baron returns to his hiding place
she makes the sign of a cross and goes to her bed
she looks around nervously apprehensively like a deer who has heard something then reassured
she places the veronal on the night table beside the glass of water
she is quiet and deliberate
she arranges the pillows under her head and lies down
she reaches for the bottle of veronal and empties it generously in her hand
she has to lean away upon one elbow from the barons position in order to balance herself
the baron steps like a cat from his hiding place
he goes to the bedside noiselessly and stands there
she reaches for the glass her hand stretches out for the glass
the baron takes her wrist suddenly
she turns quickly looking at him
the glass falls to the floor with a crash and breaks
as she moves the veronal falls out of her hands upon the bed
she struggles up to a sitting position
please do not be alarmed madam
she glances up at him
she is bewildered
she seems to be coming out of a trance
again she wants to jump from the bed
careful theres broken glass on the floor
now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness
she draws her kimono tightly around her glances across the wide expanse of bed
we see her consider passing over that way but she is now a woman again a woman of the earth it would be a silly movement
takes a pillow from the bed throws it upon the floor over the glass steps back she gets up quickly and crosses putting on her robe which was lying across
the back of a chair
her first movement is not one of alarm but of shame
she draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the baron puzzled
she thinks dreamily what is this
she glances back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this man must have watched her preparation for bed
we get a sense of relief with her
she is trembling
the baron has controlled his nerves perfectly
he senses his danger
he is caught red handed with five hundred thousand marks worth of pearls in his pocket
he is wondering if she will ring the bell
for an instant he thinks of escape
he could dash for the balcony
he could strike her dead or silence her with threats
there is in the room an intoxicating sense of romance and danger
it should be in the scene
please do not be frightened madam
after a silence what do you want here
nothing only to be here
why do you hide in my room
but surely you must know because i love you
because you love me you love me
she looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more passionately
going over to her poor little grusinskaya
does it do you good to cry
are you afraid
shall i go
i was so alone always alone and suddenly you were there and said that
sitting up no
i am not afraid
it is strange
dont cry it tears my heart to see you sob like that
regaining control nerves just nerves
you must forgive me
i have had a bad evening
i am very tired
do you know what it is to be tired tired of a routine existence
im afraid not i usually do just what i feel like doing at the moment
a look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of the situation
she rises with returning dignity and pulls her robe around her she is becoming the grusinskaya of imperial russia she is the woman grand dukes have fought for
she sweeps across the room
so you feel like coming into a ladys room and you come
following her id like to smoke a cigarette
she gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds it out to him
he takes a cigarette and lights it
she watches him curiously
she smiles as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke
she crosses and sits before her looking glass
she brushes her hair back and powders her face
she looks into the mirror we feel that she has regained a desire to live
he crosses and looks at her in the mirror
why do you look at me like that
i did not know you were so beautiful
and bitterly and then
youre so appealing so soft so tired
i feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you ever
involuntarily closing her eyes and and how tired you are
whispers in russian oh you strange strange creature
you mustnt talk russian to me
am i quite strange to you
not quite strange now
it is as if i had been expecting you
you know once when the grand duke was alive i found a man hiding in my room a young officer and
later he was found dead
i never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a womans room when shes alone
he embraces her go away
who are you
a man who could love that is all who has forgotten everything else for you
you could love me
it is so long since i have heard that word
nobody has loved me for a long time
it is so icy cold to be famous
one is so cruelly alone
how is it that you let me look at you
why could you love me
i saw you just now then i saw you cry and now i see you in the mirror grusinskaya
oh oh if you knew how i slaved and slaved for grusinskaya for the success of grusinskaya for the triumph of grusinskaya
and what is she now
just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases are you listening to me do you understand
i want you to understand
yes i do understand
i think you must go now the key is on the floor
im not going you know im not going let me stay here
i want to be alone
that is not so you dont want to be alone
he looks back at the bed as if remembering the suicide
i want to be alone no you dont want to be alone at all you were in despair before if i left you youd feel worse than you did before
you must not be alone you mustnt cry you must forget
tell me that i can stay with you tell me
whispering just for a minute then
outside the distant noise of kringelein is heard what
say it again i didnt hear
the way she says it the word goes home
it hurts him
she has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting and almost happy expression
she gets up suddenly
note the other side of the bed not where the glass is she reaches with her feet for her slippers
she puts one on
she cant find the other
business as he gets other slipper for her
he kisses her ankle and looks up at her
she smiles down
thank you you are gallant
she turns her mood has changed what a sentimental scene
grusinskaya weeping is a sight worth seeing
it is many years since she did such a thing
you frightened me badly
youre responsible for this painful scene
he watches her
the sound of her own voice reassures her
she is generating warmth
her cry has done her good she speaks quickly volubly
the stage frays ones nerves
the discipline its so exacting
discipline means doing what you dont want to do and take no pleasure in doing
do you know what i mean
have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline
i do only what i take pleasure in doing
grusinskaya turns she is graceful again
i see you do only what you take pleasure in doing
you take pleasure in coming into a womans bedroom and you come
you take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony so you do it
and what is your pleasure now
naive as he says frankly i should like to smoke
she had expected something else
his reply strikes her as chivalrous and considerate
she crosses to the writing table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds out to him
he takes a cigarette and lights it
she watches him curiously
she smiles as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke
she crosses and sits before her looking glass
she brushes her hair back and powders her face
she looks into the mirror we feel that she has regained a desire to live
he crosses and looks at her in the mirror he smiles
why do you smile
because i can see something in the mirror that you cannot
my dear he pauses suddenly what can you see
you are beautiful
beautiful but so sad
i did not know it was so dangerous to look into a womans bedroom
suddenly he stoops takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses it
a long tender and sincere embrace
her eyes close
a tremor passes through her
suddenly his whole being is aware of her
she turns rises and disengages herself
i think you had better go now
the key is on the floor
he glances back
he speaks suddenly with an air of command
im not going
you know that im not going
do you think i could leave you alone here
the veronal you
im going to stay here with you
i want to be alone
that is not the truth
he catches her wrists you do not want to be alone youre afraid of being alone i know youre afraid
i know you
you were desperate just now if i go away youll be more desperate than ever
say i am to stay with you
he almost shakes her her head falls slowly on his breast
whispers for just a minute then
she pulls away crosses the room quickly to the door with almost a cry
she looks around for the key to the door no oh no
he crosses quickly to her and holds her in his arms
just for a minute grusinskaya outside the distant noise of kringelein and the doctor
approaching the camera with the doctor
they are returning from the bar and are passing grusinskayas room
the camera precedes them
the doctor is characteristically drunk
he is silent tense cynical
a distinct contrast to kringelein whose soul is warmed for the first time by alcohol
kringeleins hat the same eccentric one is twisted upon his head jauntily
the carnation is in his buttonhole
the camera backs into kringeleins room and pauses because the doctor has paused at the door
oh but doctor
isnt this wonderful
to live to live in the grand hotel
with a deprecating gesture the grand hotel
oh but doctor
the music the champagne girls when they dance all the shining ice in those big silver things thats life life
kringelein you are drunk good night
he leaves to doctor but doctor but the doctor has gone
kringelein re enters his beautiful room
he crosses to the mirror regards himself
business ad lib
he looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat
imitating the doctor he repeats mr
kringelein you are drunk good night
he puts his hat on the knob of the bed
he takes off his coat holds it up and carefully takes the carnation out of his buttonhole
with the coat over his arm and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a glass and some water which he sees standing on the night table by
he puts the carnation in the glass having filled it with water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine bottles
his demeanor changes
he immediately becomes a thing of pain
he glances at his watch it is long past his medicine time his spirit droops he might almost be in pain
he picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops into the glass
he is about to take it he smells it a sudden impulse of well being surges over him
he flings the medicine away
with a great wave of optimism he commences to sing the song that we have heard during the evening the chambermaid song the preysing radio song the love song
he saunters around the room undressing
his voice is still heard in the passage
rows of shoes outside the doors
the dozing night clerk hears the voice and looks up startled
with his clock hears the voice
he is dozing in a chair with his clothes on
he looks up suddenly hearing the voice
he is snoring
the distant voice disturbs him
he turns in his sleep
a beautiful picture the distant voices shadows
ive never been as happy
what did you say
ive never been as happy
say it again say it
i have never been so happy
he is now dressed in an absurd night dress
he crosses to the bed still singing climbs into the huge bed the great pillows
his hand goes out he pulls out the light
he might be an emperor as he turns with a happy tired sigh
it is the first time we have seen it
there are about eight girls very busy
parts to be written we pick up essential lines as we pan down shooting at the girls faces assuming the camera to be the board
grand hotel good morning no baron von gaigerns room does not answer
baron von gaigerns chauffeur calling
good morning nine thirty doctor otternschlag
no doctor no messages
grand hotel good morning

glances at watch nine thirty mr

glancing at market report from table the preysing stock is holding its own today on the market

if the preysing people get the manchester contract we shall certainly merge with the preysing company but if they havent theyre ruined preysing will have to declare himself

the door opens and flaemmchen enters
she is agreeably surprised to see the room full of men
she likes men

gerstenkorn making notes glances at his watch again
door opens suddenly
enters good morning gentlemen

flaemmchen who has been busy preparing her little table for work is seen in several closeups with a wink to gerstenkorn manchester is a very interesting city dont you think

looking at gerstenkorn impudently we are here to discuss our merger
naturally i can make no statement at this time
we must begin at the beginning
winking at schweimann all right
far away commencing to read his report since on the eleventh of june this year when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into both
parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages
intercut this speech which if played by beery will be interesting with signals winks and signs between the other three men

flaemmchen who is on her toes and busy every minute rushes to the telephone and gives an order her conversation is heard over the conversation of the men in the
room camera water seltzer three or four bottles and cigars good ones
i can see this session is going to be exhaustive
now to proceed with the projected merger the advantages for the saxonia are so obvious
oh now lets talk like adults
you want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do
we know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldnt sound so good
when you first approached us
we did not approach you
quickly looking through the papers letter on file september fourteenth would show that you approached
snatching the document from his hand losing his temper it isnt so this was a response to a tentative feeler of your own
snatching the document violently away tentative my foot a month before this your old father in law came very privately and scratched at my door
scratched he nearly chokes we did not take the initiative
of course you took the initiative
zinnowitz enters the room
good morning gentlemen i see the conference is already underway
oh here you are justice zinnowitz im at cross purposes with these gentlemen will you clear up the situation
but the situation is perfectly clear if you will allow me he clears his throat how clear is manchester
foggy frightfully foggy always im told
to preysing have you said anything about manchester mr
i can make no statement about manchester at this time
there is dead silence for a moment he clears his throat commences in almost the same tone as preysing
since on the eleventh of june of this year when the first negotiations for a merger
over zinnowitzs voice with a sigh sits back thank god were beginning at the beginning
stops suddenly takes glasses from his nose he is speaking not reading as you remember it when you approached us
bangs the paper down we did not approach you
i know you did i said you did and i said we didnt
and i know we didnt
during all this commotion flaemmchen is paying no attention whatsoever
she is calmly spraying herself with a perfume atomizer and smiling at a gentleman
the noise continues over her
sequence omitted from original script
the atmosphere has changed the sun shines
grusinskaya is reclining on the chaise lounge her chinese robe drawn about her
she speaks voluably
oh i was ambitious then ambition was in my blood no rest no stopping
we were drilled like little soldiers we danced in the school of the imperial ballet in st
i was little and slim but hard as diamond a duty machine no rest no stopping
and then i became famous and whoever is famous is alone
but why should i be telling you this
last night i did not know you at all who are you really
i do not even know your name
i am felix benvenuto von gaigern
my mother called me flix
and how do you live
what kind of a person are you
im a prodigal son the black sheep of a white flock i shall die on the gallows
really i havent a bit of character
none at all
when i was a little boy i was taught to ride and be a gentleman at school it was a monastery i learned to pray and lie and and
and then in the war to kill and hide
and what do you do now
im a gambler im running at large like a happy pig devouring anything of life that pleases me i really belong in jail oh
what a picture and what else
seriously im also a criminal and a hotel thief
he turns away thats a silly joke
turns takes both her hands please look at me
you must believe me you must believe that i love you that i have never known what love is until last night
he releases her hands and turns away again
what is the matter
he does not answer
the baron takes the pearls out of his pocket and lays them before her
with a little cry of pain oh in the silence grusinskaya puts her head in her hands and thinks the baron makes a gesture as if to stroke her hair
and then holds back
softly did you come here just just for that
oh its horrible
she is suddenly cold
you may keep the pearls i dont want them any more ill make you a present of them
passionately i dont want them now
broken ill not denounce you
so yesterday i was a thief but now but now you must go
i give you the pearls
but now you must go i wanted money desperately can you understand
thats why i wanted the pearls
i was threatened i was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money
ive been following you ive admired you
but i have forced myself not to think about you last night at last i managed to came into your room and and now
softly and now
i couldnt go through with it
his head goes down into her lap he sighs remarkable
his hand touches her hair tenderly
do you understand
yes yes yes
there is a sudden knock at the door
with a quick gesture grusinskaya beckons the baron to the bathroom
he disappears into the bathroom
she opens the door after finding the key and radiantly addresses suzette
good morning suzette

she speaks quietly cherie

good morning good morning cherie
just to tell you im happy
bring music up
music effect over sign grand hotel
precisely the same angle as before
the sign lights
the music comes up on the dissolve into the original key shot of the lobby
senf is busy
the barons chauffeur is standing impatiently by his desk
business ad lib of senf
he turns to the chauffeur who is barring the way of an important looking alien
step back please
chauffeur makes no effort to move
against the normal busy happy traffic of the evening he is a sinister figure
he does not move but glares at senf
ive told you three times baron von gaigern is out
did he leave any message for me
no he did not there is no message
this whole scene is played in a very low key almost in a whisper it is interrupted by the entrance of the doctor
to senf any letters
during this short scene the chauffeur saunters off
kringelein comes to the doctor
oh doctor such a day such a day
they move away from the scene
kringeleins voice diminishes as the camera moves following the chauffeur
the chauffeur saunters unthoughtfully past the florist shop and out of the door
as we pass the florist shop we see the back of the baron in the shot
camera pans chauffeur out to door
he has not seen the baron in the florist shop
the camera pans back to florist shop waits for the baron who emerges carrying his usual box of orchids
camera follows baron back to senfs desk
to senf madam grusinskaya
taking the flowers and handing them to clerk for madam grusinskaya
to page boy madam grusinskaya at once to baron your chauffeurs been waiting baron
quickly shortly all right
he glances around apprehensively kringelein is speaking to the doctor
the baron approaches them
baron we must have gone a hundred miles an hour at least
to doctor weve been together all day
and in an aeroplane
life is changing you mr
yes thanks to the baron
the best shops the very best
look doctor silk feels so nice on the skin
a london hat see made in england thats silk too fifty marks
look the price is on it
that was half my salary before
the baron is a very fine gentleman no one in my life has been so nice to me as the baron
the baron smiles
he slaps his gauntlets on his dusty coat
im going to change and well meet for a drink in the yellow room
in the yellow room where the musics playing and the ladies are
amused where the musics playing and the ladies are
the baron leaves
no pain mr
oh no doctor
i think if i had pain id be too happy to notice it
note find cut here
while kringelein is talking they move away from the camera
the baron enters throws his gloves down on the bed turns up the light picks up a piece of paper thats been pushed under the door glances at it
in scrawl i have been waiting all day
will be outside or we again see the apprehension on the barons face
he crosses closes the window
as he does so we hear the noise from the conference room
bring up noise from the conference room
we must have the feeling that these men have been arguing all day
cognac bottles cigar ends selzer water remains of some sandwiches
in other words it is a business battlefield
preysing is drawn and tired
zinnowitz is on his feet
flaemmchen is fast asleep in her chair making a pretty picture
and let me say again for the tenth time
he is hoarse and tired you people were quite ready for the merger
you declared yourselves
fully agreed on all the terms why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up
ive admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger what reason have we now
the preysing company has fallon upon evil days very evil days
preysing jumps to his feet
evil days ive shown you here he bangs the paper my company exports to the balkans alone sixty five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year
mop rags mop rags were interested in something quite different
to gerstenkorn with a sigh shall i tell them again
glancing at his watch why waste time its getting late
you see what we are interested in interrupting ah come on were going home
due to the long tedious session the mens collars are wilted
preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties
youve talked enough today youre hoarse now
his hand goes to his pocket
slowly he takes out the telegram and glances at it
the following scene is played over this closeup
he gets his hat nervously youve decided against the merger
yes then its all over
yes to zinnowitz well well you could call my office
there is a general movement to go
trembling in preysings hand
deal with manchester definitely gerstenkorn crosses to preysing
goodbye preysing i hope you pull through
this is a very bad time to be in such a crisis
interrupting why talk its over its over its finished
youve broken off negotiations
you did it
youre calling them off
you had nothing on your mind all day but manchester manchester manchester
he develops almost a passion you dont suppose for one moment that im such a fool as not to have something that i could say definitely about manchester
he is generating almost a passion what
oh no no the session is over
lets go its off
thank you gentlemen
he starts packing up his papers
if you actually have news from manchester then
gentlemen i am now free to announce
he is perspiring his hands are trembling that the deal between my firm and the manchester cotton company has been successfully negotiated
preysing youre joking with us
youre a deep one
in that case give us the articles
well sign at once
we know all the details
smiling slowly folds up the telegram and puts it back in his pocket i thought wed suspended negotiations gentlemen
under these circumstances its quite a different matter
under these circumstances we might refuse to sign
by this time waitz and zinnowitz have the articles out upon the table
preysing is perspiring
gerstenkorn puts his arms around preysings shoulders
come on business is business come on preysing stands looking ahead of him
gerstenkorn picks up the papers glances at them looks at waitz
flaemmchen is awakening
heres my signature here preysing sign here
what a session this has been
while preysing is signing

we should celebrate this with a bottle of wine
with his hat and coat see you soon preysing
next week well meet and discuss further details
hasty hand shaking business of exits
waitz gerstenkorn and schweimann out
preysing has not moved
zinnowitz takes the agreement and waves it in the air to dry the signature
to himself next week
you let me talk till im hoarse and you had manchester sewed up all the time
preysing does not answer
zinnowitz amiably shrugs his shoulders
well the deal has been put through
preysing commences to laugh suddenly with increasing violence
yes it has been put through it has been put through
during this scene flaemmchen has risen piled up her papers glanced at her watch
during this action flaemmchen motions to zinnowitz that she is going down to dance etc
preysing is unaware of this action
flaemmchen leaves the room trying not to attract attention
to preysing whats the matter with you
hysterically bluff bluff all bluff
throwing the telegram on the table that
reading at out loud deal with manchester definitely off
preysing oh id never have thought it of you
no one would have thought it of me
ive been getting rusty in fredersdorf
well if bluff is what the world wants i guess i can put up as big a bluff as anyone
from now on
he turns away you must go to manchester at once yourself and really see it through
yes i must go to england i was desperate now i dont care this sort of thing goes to a mans head
what you need is some relaxation

he is picking up papers i dont know anything about women been married for twenty six years

preysing is very excited they start to leave at that moment the telephone rings
he crosses to the telephone
into telephone hello

the agreement is signed i did it
yes father in law
but now i must go to manchester
when he picks the telephone up his hands are shaking which shakes more
music crashes up kringelein and the doctor are just entering
kringelein is changed
his hair has been cut short and his moustache is gone he looks almost saucy
to barman barman whiskey to kringelein for you mr
oh please something sweet and cold

during the following speech kringelein keeps reaching for the moustache that is not there
he is thoroughly happy
what do you do in the grand hotel
eat sleep loaf around do business flirt a little dance a little
a hundred doors to one hall and nobody knows anything about the person next to him
when you leave another takes your room and lies in your bed the end
at that moment flaemmchen enters

kringelein a man who isnt with a woman is a dead man

quietly im always alone i have been everything
i was sent as a military surgeon to south africa

they move off
as they approach the bar happily preysing pushes into scene touches flaemmchens arm
i must speak with you miss flaemm
with the baron presently mr
pardon me the lady has urgent business here with me
to himself insolent berlin manners
at that moment kringelein has descended from the stool and crosses to preysing
i wish you a very good evening mr

i dont know you
oh you must know me kringelein at the plant
assistant bookkeeper building c room twenty three third floor
quickly come and dance with me mr
i must speak to you miss flaemm business
lightly tomorrow morning

preysing baron von gaigern
they bow stiffly
kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance
i could not think of not accepting
you say that you are employed by us in fredersdorf and here you are in berlin indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond
your means quite extraordinary mr
kringelein i think we will look into your books
kringelein stands watching preysing his eyes narrowing
now children no fighting save that for the office
lets have our dance
her arms go around kringelein
they dance off ill remember you mr
oh let the poor devil alone
i did not ask your advice
the two men eye each other for a moment there might be a fight
i think it would be much better if you went away
we shall see who remains here the longer
shrugging his shoulders as you will
preysing leans against the bar orders a cognac
the baron turns his back to him watching the dancing
you must look at my face and not at the floor
i never danced before in public
you dance splendidly
im happy miss flaemm
for the first time in my life im happy
kringelein shows signs of exhaustion
flaemmchen watches him quickly
lets stop im tired
it is obvious that she has stopped because of kringeleins distress
thank you miss flaemm
they move back to the bar
preysing catches flaemmchens arm
well now miss flaemm we can talk
some champagne miss flaemm
you may go mr
does the world belong to you mr
what is this insolence
do you think you have free license to be insulting
believe me you have not
you think youre superior but youre quite an ordinary man
go away go away
you dont like to see me enjoying myself
who are you
an embezzler most likely
an embezzler youre going to take that back right here in the presence of this young lady who do you think youre talking to
you think im dirt if im dirt youre a lot dirtier mr
industrial magnate preysing
yes you shut your mouth get out youre discharged
kringeleins hat has fallen from the stool upon the floor
flaemmchen picks it up brushes it
kringelein starts to laugh
the baron steps into the scene
the doctor slowly comes from the bar
you cant discharge me im my own master now at last
im ill im going to die do you understand
im going to die very soon
nothing can happen to me now
nobody can do anything any more to me
by the time you can have discharged me i shall have been dead already
his laugh becomes a convulsive sob the baron steps between the two looking straight into preysings face
he pulls him out of the scene towards the bar his fists clenched between his teeth the mans insane he acts as if he is glad he is going to
hesitates to flaemmchen i shall see you in the lobby in half an hour
the house detective later identified is talking to the chauffeur
he leaves the chauffeur and crosses to senf
better let him stay ive sent for the baron
hows your wife coming along
i was at the hospital all night walking up and down the corridor
they wouldnt let me in to see her
she has the pains but the child doesnt come and i have to stay here chained to this desk
it will be all right
i hope so
at that moment preysing enters
did you send that page
the young ladys there sir
preysing glances off to see flaemmchen standing looking around
preysing crosses to flaemmchen
oh yes mr
calls to a boy cognac for you
at that moment the baron and kringelein pass
preysing glances up at kringelein as he passes
im going to keep an eye on that kringelein fellow
ill find out where he gets the money to hang around the grand hotel
well you want me
looks straight at her yes
i must go to england at once
you see id like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and humm humm for company on the trip im nervous i need somebody i dont know if
you quite understand me

he is fidgeting a thousand marks she waits anxiously thinking it might be too much its agreed i will get a room here for you
she is looking away
i can get a room here in the grand hotel for you
she still looks away
can you pay some attention to me
looking off insolent young cub
you mean baron von gaigern
well hes a gentleman
who is leaning against a chair by a pillar with kringelein
they are not speaking
the baron is looking off at sauntering between the door and senfs desk
he slumps on the arm of the chair
watching him the baron is tired
no kringelein not tired just he shrugs his shoulders well well perhaps this evening baron we could go to the casino the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights
id like to kringelein but i cant i am broke
broke a baron
but baron the baron looks off sees the chauffeur arguing with senf
excuse me mr
he strides off keep the camera on kringelein as he watches the baron
he takes out his pocket book and looks at his money commencing to count it
the thought is in his mind of offering the baron money
moving into position
they are talking
quietly ive quit
im not going to get those pearls and neither are you
what about the money
ill pay you back
i have an idea working in my head
he glances at kringelein you might find a bullet through that head
if you did that youd get nothing except the police after you
if you wait ill give you your six thousand back at that moment a voice is heard
madam grusinskayas car madam grusinskayas car
it is passed along
calls through his little telephone madam grusinskayas car outside madam grusinskayas car quickly to chauffeur later
chauffeur exits with bad grace
baron looks off
like a pageant grusinskaya sweeps forward pretty shot
music comes up
grusinskaya is followed by suzette pimenov and meierheim
people turn to look at her
she sweeps forward
as she gets to the door she faces the baron
she steps quickly aside to him
pimenov and meierheim pause
to them go on please go on suzette
she and the baron are alone
quietly bless you
are you coming to the theatre
oh i shall dance tonight how i shall dance i want to feel that you are in the theatre
i cant explain now
oh look the pearls
you wear them now
why do you think why
theyve brought me such good luck you he takes her hand kisses it quietly
im worried about you
on the train
yes i will be on the train
bless you during this scene kringelein has been hovering nearby
as grusinskaya turns away and exits kringelein approaches the baron who is standing perfectly still looking off his mind miles away
was the baron joking or is it really true that the baron is in financial straits
lightly absolutely true kringelein and i have to raise some money immediately
if the baron if you would permit me the baron looks at him suddenly
i would be awfully glad to oblige youve been so decent to me
if i could get into a game i might win some
id like that
i have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me
if we could scare up some men to play
we could come to my room
with enthusiasm good
at that moment flaemmchen passes
yes flaemmchen hesitates as though she wanted to say something that is on her mind
a curious little scene
she doesnt speak she just turns suddenly through the door
the baron glances after her a little puzzled turns back to kringelein
they move off and are last in the crowd
no scenes inclusive sequence omitted from original script
possibly ten men are gathered about a green table
they are playing cards
there are champagne bottles glasses etc
on the table a great deal of smoke
the game is
there is a dead silence except for the monotonous words of the players
white faced the baron has the bank
otternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and approach the table
kringeleins back is to us
they are smart people not professional gamblers
there is a tension in the room
the men are gathered around tightly
we do not see the cards
the following voices are heard all right gentlemen
i play i play here up playing yes me
several men glance at kringelein and the size of his stake
is that too much baron
glances down at his own money no not at all
all right then
all right then
there is tension in the room
the baron deals two cards
kringelein takes cards
quickly dont show them
kringelein turns it down
he is like a little boy learning a new game
the baron deals himself a card
to baron what do i do now
the baron is serious
there is enough money on the table to take him to vienna
next to kringelein turn em up
oh yes thats right look
i win dont i he turns the card up the baron rises
there you are gentlemen
to kringelein will you take the bank sir
yes ill take everything gentlemen please let us drink champagne champagne is expensive and good
im winning more than i used to earn in a year double what i used to earn
he is counting his money they hand him the cards
kringelein kisses the baron he looks around
where is the baron where are you baron
at the side table the baron is standing he is drinking his face is white he has lost
rising quickly excuse me gentlemen
sitting down in kringeleins place ill take the bank all right gentlemen
kringelein has come to the baron
that was my last
youve lost everything
ive no luck
pardon me baron
permit me again
he puts bills in barons hand
baron pours out a glass of champagne he has been drinking plenty he hands glass to kringelein
drink to me kringelein its my last chance
earnestly i do drink baron i drink to you baron and to win
he drinks its good come along baron
they both move back to the table where the doctor holds the bank
i take five hundred
all of that at once baron
the baron picks cards shows them to kringelein who doesnt understand
he is triumphant
rings in background nine
the baron throws the cards into the middle of the table and turns to kringelein thats it
the lucks with you
he walks away
come along mr
im having luck for the first time in my life
your bank mr
kringelein seats himself puts his glass of champagne down on the table
doctor leaves table crosses to baron who is pouring another drink
bitterly for a while ill recover in ten or twenty years
he points look at that
he has pointed and turned off because we hear kringeleins voice ive won again baron ive won again
baron moves out of scene followed by doctor
as baron approaches table
baron i drink and win i drink and win i win and drink
he is pulling money towards him counting it eagerly frantically not the movement of a miser not a greedy movement but the movement of an excited child liberated
money has become so much mad paper to him
during the foregoing scene one of the men at the table has answered the ringing of the telephone bell he comes back now
there are complaints in the hotel about the noise
what time is it
lets break it up
to kringelein youve been very lucky
wheres my coat
hes drunk anyway
lets wind up the game im broke and tired you cant play against him
i put my hat down here somewhere
i think ill have a drink before i go
by the way ive got to see you tomorrow morning
howve you been doctor
business ad lib
general business of slow normal exit
kringelein looks up from counting his money
he has been like a little boy with a christmas stocking
he looks up suddenly sees men are leaving oh dont go gentlemen
stay a while
he stands to his feet be my guests
by this time the men are pausing by the door
i oughtnt to presume but i he is a little drunk im so grateful to you its been so marvelous
the first time in my life i have gambled ive danced
oh you can laugh gentlemen but its the first time in my life ive ever tasted life
slapping him on back splendid
there is a general feeling in the room that although this man is drunk he is terribly sincere and that there is no wish to embarrass themselves or him
in fact there is a nervous impatient movement among the men
but kringelein has reached an emotional pitch
life gentlemen is wonderful but very dangerous
you must have courage for it then its wonderful
you gentlemen dont know that because you are all healthy and happy but i believe me a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything
sings rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns
general noise among men some are ribald others are serious
two men come and shake hands with kringelein bidding him goodnight
the baron puts his hand restrainingly on kringeleins shoulder
kringelein almost staggers towards the sideboard
the men are nearing the door
starts singing its a short life and a gay one
seizing a glass of champagne every glass high to life the splendid dangerous mighty brief brief life and the courage to live it
turns to baron baron you know ive only lived since last night but that little while seems longer than all the time before all the he collapses suddenly onto the
floor business ad lib
the doctor is there quickly
the baron next
general normal business ad lib between the men
perhaps three of them help him up including the baron
they carry kringelein to the bed
of players mingling drunk
no hes ill
well paused over hes a doctor the doctors here hes just drunk
gentlemen this man is ill very ill if you will leave
hes not used to champagne why does he drink it
little comedy on exit
intercut for relief kringeleins face white drawn tragic
one man perhaps remains
can i help doctor
no the baron will stay
during this scene the baron has been carefully making kringelein comfortable on the bed bolstering pillows behind his head
kringeleins eyes are shut tightly his hands are limp
by the business of the baron although we do not of course know it this is the time that he takes the wallet from kringelein and puts it in his
we might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his inside pocket he stands looking down
drops kringeleins hand it will be over in a minute
kringeleins eyes flutter
his voice sounds hoarsely over over so soon it has just begun
he closes his eyes suddenly oh the pain
try and sleep kringelein dont be afraid
mutteringly id like to live a little longer but im not afraid to die im not
touching his shoulder gently youll be all right kringelein
he moves from the bed takes out a cigarette moves to the table
he seizes his drink out of scene my pocketbook
my money in it
what do you say what
we watch barons face he looks back over his shoulder
you what oh isnt it there
no but no i baron ive lost my pocketbook
baron turns in this scene
he walks forward toward them
the doctors hands are on kringeleins coat
there is no pocketbook here
on the floor probably
he glances down starting up suddenly more than fourteen thousand marks
were in that pocketbook
looking at baron fourteen thousand marks
one can travel ones happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks dont you think so baron
with a shrug quite possibly
at that moment kringelein who has been staring up at the ceiling his hands clenching and reclenching starts up
oh ive got to find it
stay where you are
no i must find it he starts talking fourteen thousand two hundred marks
he pulls himself to the side of the bed the doctor goes to restrain him
im all right doctor
theres no pain now only you dont know what that money means to a man like me
he is suddenly on his hands and knees crawling along the floor looking for it like a little boy his drunkenness his condition makes the situation tragic
he actually gets under the card table
the doctor looks at the baron
the baron only watches kringelein
he follows him fascinated
talking at intervals as he crawls looking for money you dont know because youve never lived like a dog in a hole and saved and scrimped
my life hangs upon that money baron
nobody gives you anything
you have to buy everything and pay cash for it
i wanted to pay for my last days with that money
every hour costs money
ive nothing nothing but that pocketbook
he crawls along the floor on his hands and knees talking to the carpet as he looks i must have it back
he pauses breathless like an animal along the wall looking up at the men the foregoing speech is intercut with the following action in which kringeleins voice is heard throughout
thus it is not a long speech the baron watches
he throws his cigarette away he bites his lip sweat breaks out upon his forehead again he is a thief
when he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped him
now he wants this money and pity a slow growing pity for this tragic dying thing is stopping him and all the time the doctor watches
the one whole eye pierces into the barons melting conscience
twice during the speech at a spot through and during rehearsal to be selected the doctors voice droning but piercing says he must find his money baron
next time mr
kringelein should find his pocketbook baron shouldnt he
these are two interjections
and now kringelein lies upon the floor a troubled little sack of pain his head down
the baron turns away
he bends down as though he were looking for the pocketbook
we see him take it from his pocket and turn
there is a very light almost triumphant ring in his voice as he says here here it is
heres your pocketbook kringelein
his head coming up oh yes thats it you found it you found it for me baron
quickly goodnight kringelein
he moves towards the door
no no please oh dont go dont go dont leave me alone baron
youve nothing to fear kringelein no
come get up come let me help you
note if he is a strong actor he can pick kringelein up if not he and doctor lift kringelein to bed
youre all right now its very late goodnight kringelein
oh no stay here baron stay
baron bites his lip
it is the first and only time in the play that we see a tear near the strong man almost breaks
his hand presses on kringeleins shoulder he exits baron shuts door and pauses
in front of him is the door of the woman he loves
down beyond is his own empty room
in his pockets nothing
in his closeup he makes the audience feel his problem with him
this man who has lived and whistled and love through the play becomes a tragic lonely harrassed figure
the baron has broken
his fists dig into his eyes he brushes his hair back
over this comes with almost an impertinence a tiny whistle
he looks up and away down the corridor
the figure of flaemmchen stands there a small black bag in her hand
the baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically
he walks down the corridor
flaemmchen what are you doing here in the middle of the night
looking for my room one sixty six
you live here
she points to door she looks at him a long time oh
well such is life flaemmchen
and baron thanks so much for everything
they both go into their respective rooms
here are our two gay young characters
the gay fresh flaemmchen and the debonair baron crucified for lack of funds
both trying to smile both trying to be light about themselves
yet each about to involve themselves tragically for the want of a little money
flaemmchen enters her room cautiously
except for one lamp burning the room is in darkness and empty
from the adjoining door to preysings room a thin stream of light
she puts down her bag quickly tiptoes through the bathroom to his door
she peeps through
from her angle
preysing stretched on bed flat his stomach a mountain and on it the magazine that he has been reading with flaemmchens picture
he is looking at the ceiling
she knows he is awake because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his hand
an idea occurs to her
she could possibly sneak into bed and he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night
camera follows her as she tiptoes to her room
she closes the door noiselessly and listens
she throws off her hat and takes off her coat
opens her bag and takes out night dress lingerie etc
the lid of her bag falls suddenly
she starts at the noise
has it awakened him
she looks off
the thin stream of light is filled suddenly the door of the adjoining room opens and back lighted from the other room the huge form of preysing appears
in this odd lighting he is a little more than preysing
he comes forward
he speaks hoarsely quietly
he seizes her to him she goes to his arms passively
he rubs his face in her hair
she is passive cold
breathlessly you are late
ive been waiting for you waiting
i had to arrange about the trip
you think so
he holds her again trying to kiss her
she deliberately avoids his kiss
awkwardly come here
he sits heavily on the bed sitting on her night dress
here hold up
preysing rises while she pulls her night dress from under him
he draws her to him
oh careful mr
call me do you know would you would you like to call me by my first name
pulling away glad of an excuse for conversation oh no
i couldnt do that youre a stranger to me
youre a funny little creature flaemmchen
i cant make you out
its not funny at all
one cant get intimate just off hand
i could go to england with you and everything like that supposing i met you next year and i said how do you do mr
and you said she imitates him that was the young lady who was my secretary in manchester
thats all quite proper
she is happy again
she would rather talk than be squeezed but supposing i met you when you were with your wife and i called out hello you big baby remember manchester
and you with your wife how would you like that
there is a pause for a moment
please flaemmchen well leave my wife out of this
flaemmchen yawns straight in his face
ill get undressed get out
he moves towards the windows which are open
she pushes his fat body out almost playfully through the doors and onto the balcony
preysing stands out on the balcony
he looks down in the street below then off
he starts suddenly because he sees a shadow over the railing of his own balcony
he is puzzled
shadow crosses again
who can be in his room
he moves forward and peeps through the window
one side of the french window is closed
from his angle we see the baron furtively searching the room
he is now wearing an overcoat the collar is turned up
business ad lib
he finds preysings wallet
he stuffs this in his overcoat pocket
preysings face watching him
as baron turns to exit preysing surges forward pulling the window after him
the two men face each other
what do you want here
i must have made a mistake
made a mistake remarkable
we shall soon see if you made a mistake
the baron starts to leave
bellowing stay here
give me that money
the baron hands him the pocketbook without a word
so thats how we stand baron
look here sir im completely at your mercy im desperate its a matter of life or death i had to get some money tonight
indeed you must baron you must
humm humm but you must go to jail baron youre a thief
im going to call the police
im going to watch you play the great baron with the police
he picks up the telephone the baron makes for the door on the other side of the room pulls at the knob
the door is locked baron
the baron makes one dive across the room
preysing grasps at his coat and tears it
with one hand holding the telephone the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground and one hand holding the baron
into telephone hello
dont do that
he tries to snatch the telephone from preysing
preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the baron
the action excites him
strike me would you
attack me would you
attack me with a terrific lunge preysing brings the telephone down upon the barons head
the baron sways stunned
as in book
in his mad rage preysing hits again with the telephone
ill strike you ill strike you ill strike you strike me
by this time the baron is a heap on the floor
we see preysing come out of his blind trance
he even repeats again
i strike you with telephone foolishly in his hand he looks down at what he has done
sharp sound of buzzing
dozing night girl plugs in lazily
yes yes operator operator she listens says to herself they are having a nice little game up there with the telephone
with nonchalance she flicks plug out again as she does so new angle
preysing is on his feet
he has replaced the receiver on the telephone he is putting it back slowly
he is terrified
door opens behind him
flaemmchen with a dressing gown on light filmy thing crosses and looks down at the baron without a word
preysing seizes her
her hand goes to her head her eyes roll for a moment we think she is going to faint right on top of the baron
she is trying to collect her senses it cannot be true
we can hear nothing but the heavy breathing of preysing and the traffic below
suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident it is the first time we have been conscious of it
with a swift movement flaemmchen dashes towards the door
it is locked
she rushes back as if to cut through her own room
he reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from her leaving her almost naked
he lunges after her
she tears through her own room
flaemmchen enters from her room
she looks this way and that
after all it is flaemmchen and not lillian gish running across the ice in way down east it is flaemmchen a berlin girl
she pauses to try and clear her brain
what the hell is this what is it
the impulse naturally is to scream in alarm
she doesnt flaemmchens dont
she looks around
at the end of the passage is kringeleins room
she will go there
we watch her run down the passage uncertainly
without knocking she pushes open kringeleins door
it is in darkness
the only light comes through the windows
the form of kringelein lies prone upon the bed the doctor had just thrown a coat over him
he is still in his trousers and shirt
like a ghost flaemmchen the shreds of her filmy clothes hanging to her crosses
hoarse whisper mr
kringelein where are you
she sweeps to bed
she shakes him
kringelein starts up
oh what what he is looking up at what seems to be a ghost
she pulls on the light by the bed it flames up on their faces
oh oh miss flaemmchen
its you quick something awful awful has happened
go go at once mr
it occurs to him that this girl with her torn clothes must have been roughly treated by preysing
he suddenly assumes a strength
oh dont wait go its awful its awful
she slides down to the floor by the side of the bed
kringelein climbs out of bed tries to help her up
she waves him away
dont wait now go preysing
kringelein assumes suddenly a strength
he is a man for a crisis he forgets that he was ever ill he leaves
we go with him
cut him down corridor quickly
he pauses outside preysings door uncertain of the rooms then he knocks
preysing oh mr
preysing he feels there must be a mistake he steps back sees flaemmchens door open next to it
looks through bathroom
goes quickly forward
preysing is still leaning against the table his mouth is open he is gaping stunned
the two hundred and four pounds has collapsed and sagged
he is staring his victim lying a heap upon the floor very still and quiet
his eyes come around as kringelein enters
kringelein crosses looks down
touches the barons hand
oh the baron the baron
he tried to rob me he is dead my best friend poor baron dead just like that
we must do something
quickly yes the police must be called
no no wait the man was a burglar he was going to steal my money
oh no no not the baron
suddenly where is that girl she was working with him she enticed me into her room
her room oh i see mr
preysing i understand mr
general director preysing

yes i know them the scandal we are men you you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself take her and hold your tongue

preysing takes him by the shoulders
how much how much do you want you need money you have nothing
dont worry about me mr
general director pryesing worry about yourself
he picks up receiver there has been a murder this is room one sixty four
telephone girl plugs in
hello hurry up
someone in one sixty four says there has been a murder
the scene gradually grows intense
porter calls night man
here quick here go to one sixty four immediately
calls back on telephone give me mr
rohna rohna the manager
rohna sits up in bed turns on light picks up telephone on his face we see him hear the news

wait a minute
speaks in a monotone instruct everyone to use the utmost tact we must have no scandal in the grand hotel
answer no questions im coming now inform the police
he replaces the telephone commences dressing quickly trunks standing around everywhere
suzette is finishing packing
grusinskaya is sitting in front of the mirror in a loose night wrap she is doing her hair
madam should sleep
ive done my hair differently do you like that
when a lady falls in love she does her hair differently
rising in the middle of the night those flowers make me think of a funeral
laurels and tube roses
she pushes the window closed shivers it is chilly
she crosses the room turning out one of the lights oh think suzette the villa and the sun at tremezzo quiet simple happy well have a guest suzette
quietly yes madam
and now madam will sleep
it is not long till the train
suzette leaves turning out a light
alone grusinskaya goes to the telephone
she raises the receiver

music up as we the trees and the milk cart effect and other curious signs of dawn which we remember after the climax of the first sequence
music cold and eerie
general early morning bustle and activity
from one van fruit and vegetables are being unloaded
from another huge hind quarters of beef are being carried in and in a monotonous way a baker throws two loaves at a time to another man from a van
backed up counting forty two forty four forty six forty eight fifty fifty two waiters coming to work
a noisy racket
sandwiched between the bread and butcher vans is backed a hearse
at the moment we come upon it the men are pausing in their work to glance
the men take off their caps as proceeded by the hotel detective and others who will be there the corpse of the baron in the basket used at such time
is brought out and placed in the hearse which drives noisily away
a policeman rides with the driver on the box
by this time the man with the bread is counting one hundred and eight one hundred and ten one hundred and twelve
stay with him for a moment
shooting onto door day lighting
a man comes out and signals a black closed limousine which pulls forward
sense of chill and desolation
some chairs stand on tables
a vacuum cleaner is at work on the carpets
newspaper boys are delivering papers at the news stand
the various shops are slowly being opened the windows being cleaned
the general feeling of the beginning of another day
the camera waits at a distance shooting from door as preysing with a plain clothes man on either side of him leaves moving towards the camera
he is grim his hat is drawn over his eyes
his hands deep in his pockets
when he has passed the the old shot meierheim is entering quickly goes through the door
he crosses now to pimenov
they talk eagerly out of earshot
but it is apparent that meierheim is as usual in a hurry
rohna is there too
one of the men carries a telephone stand wrapped loosely in paper
but we know its the telephone stand
senf comes on duty looks around it is apparent that he is late
the night clerk has already gone you are late
man i was at the clinic the whole night there are no words to describe what my wife suffered
and the child isnt coming
no no not yet
well i mustnt let it interfere with my duty
any news here
yes killing in number one sixty four
the big manufacturer killed baron von gaigern
i dont know

he was a nice fellow i am sorry about him
it seems that he was a thief and an imposter
i dont believe it he was a real gentleman
i know people
im so tired i can hardly see out of my eyes
no sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel that means a lot of work
but its too bad about the baron you always felt better when he came along always friendly such an agreeable fellow
most imposters are a number of bellboys march up and form a line
senf comes from behind the desk and inspects them
in chorus good morning

boys take off their caps good caps on
boys put on their caps where is number seven
to clerk take his name if he comes late again today hes fired
the boys sit down on the bench
kringelein and the police officer move towards the desk in ear shot
that will be sufficient for the present sir you may travel in peace
as kringelein emerges from the elevator suzette speaking to the floor clerk
and theyve taken him away
yes its terrible
madam must not know you understand madam must not know
i will tell the maids

by this time kringelein has arrived at his door he opens it
kringelein opens the door and enters
flaemmchen is looking into space
a lovely picture
morning light over her hair she is dressed
whats the matter
oh i was thinking poor baron lying there his eyes so open
you loved the baron didnt you
yes so did i
he was friendly to me as no man ever was
perhaps he really was a burglar but they dont kill a man for that
he was in desperate straits

he laughed poor devil
and then a man like preysing kills him
naively i didnt like preysing right off
then why did you have anything to do with him

the figure of grusinskaya is standing at her door there is no one with her
suzette steps out

she looks off
coming out of the elevator
grusinskaya hurries down to pimenov they meet
breathlessly he will be on the train

she crosses and looks in the barons room
a maid is there changing the bedding
the room is unoccupied otherwise
baron von gaigern has left
the maid nods

the baron left about half an hour ago madam
oh gru come come well lose the train
while they are waiting for the elevator grusinskaya is like a live electric wire
the elevator arrives

a bellboy attempts to take his bag but kringelein still confused draws his hand with the suitcase away from the bellboy

boys line up making a deep bow
there is almost a triumphant march as kringelein and flaemmchen move towards the door
in chorus come again your excellency
with head erect happy smile on his face kringelein leaves the lobby
normal activity in lobby reminding us of opening scene
doctor comes up to desk
