written by steven zaillian aaron sorkin there will always be people who are ahead of the curve and people who are behind the curve
but knowledge moves the curve
bill james static shots a deserted locker room
cinder block tunnels lit with wire encased lamps like in a coal mine
three security guards watch a game on a tv
legend october we begin to hear disembodied cheering crowds and the faint voice of an announcer nobody on two and two to saenz who has just three at bats in
the series and none of them hits as he settles back in at the end of a tunnel the as empty dugout
the empty diamond
just a couple of the floodlights are on
rivera looks in for the sign he has it the pitch saenz swings and the announcers voice and excited crowd abruptly cut off
in silence we regard the empty seats that wrap around the playing field
but then see that in fact its empty seats
theres a lone figure seated in one of them
the sound snaps back on a ground out to second thom is not what the as were looking for from saenz down by two in the ninth the lone man
in the stadium has a radio and a bag of peanuts
he seems at peace as he looks down on the empty diamond a peace only slightly belied perhaps by the baseball he absently turns in a hand
he switches the radio back on eric byrnes has emerged from the dugout to bat for menechino
he turns it off again
calmly eats a peanut
switches the radio back on the as are down to their last strike and this yankee crowd is on its feet rivera squints for the sign he has it delivers
and again at the crucial moment he cuts the radio
waits just a few moments
turns the radio back on it is bedlam in new york
the yankees down two games to none have come back to win three and the division series
the outcome of the series seems to have no effect on billy
he simply gets up switches off the radio and climbs the steps to leave
but somehow we still faintly hear as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward an exit the voice of one of the announcers this is an exceptional feat not only
for new york thom but for oakland though not the kind you can be proud of only once before has a team lost a division series after winning the first two games its coming from a small television a night security guard is watching
but when he sees billy approaching he quickly shuts it off
its okay joe you can leave it on
its no big deal
no its okay i dont need to watch it
the guards eyes consider the baseball billy absently turns in his hands hows meg
shes good thanks
and the glass window of the bar behind him
and the boys
the security guard waits for the baseball to sail through the glass but it doesnt happen
it was a great season
a lone car sits in the parking lot in front of the coliseum
we hear they had three times your payroll billy
youre not watching them celebrate right
billy sits in the dark on his phone
that would be uh pointless
are you asking me to pick one
what you should be doing is thinking about what an amazing job you did and how great you are
ill be honest right this minute im not thinking about either of those things
you take a team with that payroll to the playoffs
you take the yankees to a fifth game
im not even sure the better team won
they were down two love and then beat us three in a row
trust me the better team won
billy presses a button on his portable radio and is hit with sound of sports talk radio while embarrassing the entire city and making a mockery of their fans
im sick of this
lets go away
that sounds good
three enormous looming likenesses of the oakland as premiere players on floodlit banners jason giambi johnny damon jason isringhausen
someplace they dont have a baseball team
how about oakland
okay here are the rules for tonight
you can do anything you want but you cant give any quotes to the press go on the internet or hurt my car we have a deal
they had three times your payroll billy
from the radio weve been hearing shards of an unprecedented choke get rid of billy beane billy beane knows nothing about baseball
how about hawaii
ill make a reservation someplace
the place with the turtles
billy gets out of the car
im on my way
billy chucks the radio away
gets back in the car puts it in gear
hard cut to blur of shapes and colors as we move through a crush of travelers to a hawaiian airlines counter where billy and tara check luggage
billys got a cell phone to his ear
is it boston
youre talking to boston
what are they offering
what does it matter to you
i mean what does it matter since whatever it is you cant afford it
you dont know that
you need to hurry
i dont know that since i dont know what theyre offering
what did she say
she said we had to hurry up
the calls been disconnected
cut to another corridor as billy and tara head toward security
billy on the phone with boras continuing where they left off what did they offer
they offered seven and a quarter
just to be clear they offered seven and a quarter
as opposed to you said seven and a quarter and theyre thinking about it
no they offered seven and a quarter and im thinking about it
nothing from billy and youre thinking what
im thinking i dont want to lose damon but i dont pay my whole infield seven million dollars
were losing damon
for seven and a half billy you can keep johnny damon and we can be done thinking
i have to go my plane is boarding
wait dont hang up
dont hang up billy drops the phone in a plastic container steps through the metal detector like its a stick up grabs the phone again
is that phone still on
whats the difference
can his phone be on
sir you need to turn your phone off
its already through
billy grabs his phone from the other side
seven point five
seven point five
ill talk to steve

boras hangs up
try to relax
hitting speed dial on another number a small emergency is starting to develop
try to relax
you look fantastic today
we gotta talk about giambi
wait were losing giambi too
i cant talk about that now
i cant talk about anything now
we can talk now

im at a family thing

im talking to everybody
but not today
im not in today

billy dials another number a thousand dollars says you dont get on the plane
arn tellems office
these guys are auctioning off my team one player at a time
hes not in today billy
i know i just want to send him flowers
where would i send them
you want to send him flowers
youre not going to be anywhere near hawaii
to where he is now yes
beth israel temple beverly hills
the airport is as close as you got
thank you tara
i need a day
ill fly out tomorrow
its gonna be more than one day
were losing isringhausen too
only if my luck stays exactly the same
its like the bell rang but youre still getting hit in the head
hands him tickets just in case
have fun out there
im picking up a guy at the breakfast buffet
a left handed reliever if you can
the ceremony is in progress as billy arrives plucks a yarmulke from a basket sets it on his head and finds a place in the back row for himself and
his carry on
he listens to the boys monotone reading of verses
taps his foot
checks his watch
turns to the person down the row and whispers how much longer you think
nah its okay
as attendees exit the ceremony and enter the adjacent banquet hall billy has cornered arn tellem picking up right where he left off three hours ago in oakland on the
arn i dont wanna lose him
i dont wanna lose him
this is my nephews bar mitzvah
he did well with his torah portion i thought
what did they offer
hes not staying in oakland billy
what did the yankees offer him
its new york youve got to give a player a reason not to play there
what did they offer
i dont pay my whole infield million dollars
i know i know
for how long
a year for seven years
billy stares completely nonplussed
a hundred and twenty million dollars
hundred and nineteen
you gotta get steve to let you spend some money
thats pretty good advice i should do that
steve doesnt get it
this isnt a charity raffle
i get it he gets it jason gets it and you certainly get it
ill talk to him
and youre losing isringhausen too
ive gotta get back
hey mazel tov arn
arn walks away
billy looks to his right to see a year old kid standing right next to him
are you billy beane
that was a pretty serious choke
are you from around here
you a dodger fan
billy hands the kid his scotch here drink a lot of this
and walks away
billy tries but is having trouble sitting still as he talks with steve schott the as owner around a college player way back when
hes a successful home builder now
models of developments lie around
were losing damon and giambi
we cant survive losing damon and giambi
isringhausens gone too dont you think
i can win without a closer
i cant without power
so negotiate with them
they want more
so offer them a little more
they want more than a little more
whatll it cost say to keep giambi
for how many years one
for one year
and billy knows what it means
it means that makes it easy theres nothing more to discuss on the matter
i have confidence youll find a way to make it work without them
sure you can
what are we
the taj mahal
were a small market team
obviously we cant afford giambi at such a price fine
but i might for a bit more than last year be able to keep damon in oakland steve is shaking his i need more money steve
i cant compete against a hundred and twenty million dollar payroll with a forty million dollar payroll
we just won games with a forty million dollar payroll
with giambi and damon
we wouldnt have without them
then you cant ask me to be okay with losing
thats too much to ask a professional athlete
its too much steve
youre not a professional athlete
youre a professional gm
were a small market team
youre a small market gm
and im asking you to be okay with not spending money i dont have
and im asking you to take a breath and shake off the loss
and then im asking you to get back in a room with your people and figure out how youre going to replace these guys with the money i do have
schott can go from milquetoast to ruthless in a blink and he just did
billys on his cell again as he crosses the bay bridge
what was that beep
its just my phone its about to die but thisll be quick listen im losing my favorite prospects but i got you the seven point five
ill get right back to no
no you wont
i got it for you and were done
damon stays in oakland
billy i have to talk to johnny obviously
its my fiduciary duty whose number is that seven point five
no its mine its yours
so make your call but dont play me scott
we have a deal
i wont be a stalking horse
the word stays in the dictionary
the door pushes open and billy comes in after his very long day
he sets his carry on bag down
takes out his dead cell phone and plugs it into a charger
calls tara on the land line
im gonna need another day
take your time do your thing
there are a lot of cute guys here
youve got my suitcase
no the airline sent it to prague
well we left out of oakland honey
and i think the baggage handlers knew it was yours
beat can this get any worse
billys cell phone rings i gotta take this
wish you werent insane
she hangs up
billy hangs up and switches to his cell yeah
i just got off the phone with dan
no you didnt
yeah i was surprised he even called me
because he had said no i have johnny for seven point five or hes not playing anywhere because thats the deal boston just upped it to seven seven five
billys hand is already in motion to smash the phone but in a herculean feat of self disciple he manages to restrain himself before impact
we had a deal
we have a deal
if its eight million
why am i the ugliest girl at the dance scott
why do i get the feeling im always gonna be a quarter million short
im just doing my job for my client
thats all im doing
no you played me
and youre playing me now
billy hangs up on him
billy and his scouting department ten men older than him all former players and tobacco chewers still each with his own can of copenhagen and wastebasket sitting around a large
underground cinder block war room whose most extravagant appointment is a mr
two large white boards dominate a wall covered with magnetic strips with players names on them
on the left board every player in the as organization
on the other even larger board every player that may be of interest to them from the other organizations
its the most complex chess board you will ever see
but what can be easily discerned are the obvious holes in the as team the star players they are about to lose their names set apart from the positions theyre
vacating jason giambi b johnny damon cf jason isringhausen rp
we had a great year
we won games and we only came a buck short in new york
now the bad news
weve got three big holes to fill
lets start with who we like for giambi
well go around the room
who you like matty
i like geronimo
approval from the guys an athlete
this guy is big fast and talented
six foot four
top of my list
clean cut good face
hes the real deal
five tools good lookin
can he hit
hes a tools guy
can he hit
hes got a great swing
so youre saying he cant hit
he can hit
the ball explodes off his bat
when he hits it sounds like hes droppin a firecracker at his feet
down in the pisser you can hear that sound
sounds like mays mantle aaron
thats not what i asked
i asked can he hit
hes a good hitter
if hes a good hitter why doesnt he hit good
he needs a little work
hell be able to hit
he could be a great hitter
we put him up against big league competition and suddenly hell be able to hit
grady moves on artie who do we like
billy backs off incredulous as the scouts prattle on i like perez
he swings like a man
he swings like a man who swings at too much
theres some work needs to be done
i admit it
he needs to be reworked a little
but hes noticeable
no hes noticeable
you notice him
hes got an ugly girlfriend
whats that mean
ugly girlfriend means no confidence
i agree with art
i like the way he walks into a room
kids so confident his dick gets there two minutes before he does
passes the eye candy test
hes got the looks hes ready to play the part
he just needs some playing time
im just saying his girlfriends a
billy if you want to talk about another giambi this guy could be it
billy raises a book above the table drops it with a dull thud
is that a suggestion billy
youre talking like this is business as usual
were trying to solve the problem
not like this
youre not even looking at the problem
we not only have a very clear understanding of the problem we now face but everyone in this room has faced similar problems countless times before
whats the problem
the problem is that weve lost key players that we now have to replace
whats the problem
the problem is the same as it always is weve got to put a team together with what weve got
whats the problem
weve got home runs to replace rbis doubles
the problem were trying to solve is that this is an unfair game
there are rich teams poor teams feet of crap and then theres us
and now weve been gutted
were organ donors to the rich
the red sox took our kidneys and the yankees took our heart
and now im listening to the same old shit about having a good body and being a tools guy like youre looking for fabio
is there another first baseman like giambi
everyone mumbles no
then stop looking for one because what well surely wind up with is the mcnuggets version of giambi
look were gonna find guys put em through player development teach em how to play oakland a baseball
this is no time to push the panic button
this is the way weve been doing it for years
let us do our job
if we try to play like the yankees in here were not going to be able to play with them out there
thats fortune cookie wisdom
no its just regular wisdom
clearly you have something on your mind
youre not serious
were not playing fantasy baseball billy
those arent new ideas they disproved that years ago
bill james was a night security guard at the stokely van camp pork and beans factory
he thinks differently than anyone in baseball
hes not in baseball
hes in pork and beans
dont attack the man attack the argument
to the room i think he just won the argument
what if weve been wrong this whole time about what ingredients manufacture a win
what if this whole time we thought it was the chicken that made the chicken soup taste good when really it was the onions that made the chicken soup taste
onions are a lot cheaper than chicken you see what im saying
i dont have the first idea what youre saying
we gotta start over
we gotta rethink this thing
we gotta look where others arent looking
with all due respect weve been doing this for a long time
that doesnt mean youre doing it right
do you watch nature docs
you know what happens to the runt of the litter
im open to any solution as long as its not what the other guys are doing
now im going to cleveland to poach an outfielder named brandon garcia hold on youre going to cleveland for a double a guy
billy ive seen garcia
hes got a bad body
its not a pretty sight
kid wears a large pair of underwear
that is a big boy
hes not just big but kind of doughy
a fleshy kind of body
oh you mean like babe ruth
hes no babe ruth
when he walks billy his thighs stick together
theres enough friction there to start a bonfire
if you saw him im telling you you wouldnt want to go to cleveland
billy can i make a suggestion
if you could get ricardo rincon
hed be worth the trip to cleveland
that would solve our left handed reliever problem
unanimous approval from the scouts really
i should get rincon
ill also come back with joe dimaggio and ty cobb
and who would like a faberge egg
guys you arent hearing me in what universe can we afford rincon
im asking you guys to look at this game differently than youve ever looked at it before
im going to cleveland
and when i come back i want you to tell me something i dont already know
i want to question everything
weve got to rethink this game
as he exits and grady
nobody cares about a win season
billy storms out
whats a faberge egg
a ball sails well over the heads of the scouts in the outfield who are shagging the batting practice flies
the kids in the parking lot have seen billy play before and so know just how far back to stand in order to shag a ball
billys at the plate crushing pitches from a pitching machine
he sends another one sailing over the heads of the cluster of scouts
billy tanned and glistening with sweat looks over to see three girls watching him from behind the backstop
theyre looking at him like hes elvis and billy tries to nonchalant it but cant help a small smile to himself this is the guy
hes got a great path
i love the extension in his swing and the backspin he creates
thats some amazing power right there huh
good approach great balance
hows he compare to the others around the country
hes number one
lets just hope hes still there when we pick
this guyll go in the first round
the scouts put the players through their paces sprinting fielding
sabatini and martinez are talking to billy whos toweling off and is still a little aware of all the people who are standing nearby to watch the birth of a
im sabatini area scout new york mets
can we get a couple minutes of your time find out more about you
id like to introduce you to tom martinez
very impressive performance today
in my job as the national cross checker for the new york mets i see the top players in the united states
its been a while since ive seen a five tools guy the complete package
your throwing ability your fielding skills
ed told me you had power but i had no idea it was of the light tower variety
i hope youre as interested in professional baseball as we are in acquiring you in the upcoming draft
well sir id need to talk it out with my parents decide if baseball is something i want to do full time
i have a scholarship to play football at stanford
well billy were certainly looking forward to meeting your folks and talking to them as well
and we believe in college but thats something you can do in the winter months
you need to know the skys the limit with your ability
you could be a superstar before youve even graduated
but to get to that level you need to work with our people
pro ball is where you need to be to develop the skills god gave you
unlike the as this is a franchise that can spend actual money on players and on nice lobby furniture which is where billy sits staring at a classic baseball photo
that hangs in the lobby
marks ready to see you now
billys counterpart in cleveland indians general manager mark shapiro and about three weeks into the job sits behind his desk in a tie and shirt sleeves like billy
joining them in the room are four others including peter so billy what are you looking for
million in additional payroll
i shouldve been a hitter
wheres steve in all this
excited about rebuilding the team
bonds is available
yeah how do i afford the rest of the field
so what are you looking for
i want to help out
i guess youve touched the bottom of the sports industry when your opponent is i need a lefty reliever and i want ricardo rincon
not going to happen
not even a discussion
come on billy even if you could afford him were not about to let him go
youve got the venezuelan kid in north carolina youre bringing up
we dished him to detroit
well there goes my other idea
what else you thinking billy
you have any outfielders i should be looking at
to replace damon
thats a tough one billy
who do you got
the guys you might be able to afford
tell me about garcia
to replace damon
is he healthy
he had a back thing some minor surgery but hes okay
hell be good by spring training
i can give you guthrie for him if you kick in some cash
as shapiro and gang review guthries stats billy notices peter whispering to the guy next to him
shapiro looks around the room at the guys who dont object
how much are you thinking
bruce approaches shapiro and whispers and steps away
sorry about that
garcia is going to be a no
what else are you thinking about
lets make it work ill go straight up with you garcia for guthrie no kicker
shapiro looks to bruce peter is covering his mouth with his hand but we can just barely hear him whisper the word no
bruce subtly shakes his head to mark
sorry billy who else you interested in
peter sits at his cubicle absorbed in his computer until he notices billy hovering over him
who are you
my name is peter brand
what do you do
im special assistant to mark shapiro
so what do you do
pointing at co hey mind your own business
what do you do
mostly player evaluation right now
why does mark listen to you
actually he rarely does
he just did
i dont think he was really listening to me in there per se
yeah i think he was listening to bruce
who are you
i dont give a rats ass about your name
nothing from peter
what happened in there
im not sure what youre asking me
what did you tell butch
i told him i like garcia
probably for the same reasons you do
you were smart to go after him
what makes him undervalued
peter is stuck
he cant bring himself to say anything
after a long beat billy nods to him in a way that seems to say i understand its okay
billy makes a strong gesture indicating peter to follow
which he does
they exit the offices into where you from peter
where did you go to school
i hate yale
kid from yale once blocked a trade i was trying to make
whatd you study
what are you doing in baseball
i love baseball
im just curious
why were you so cagey in there
i work for a different team
i know but im the first person in baseball whos ever talked to you this long
why is garcia undervalued
okay truthfully it might not be so easy to explain
whys that peter
we might not see the game the same way
what do you mean by that
youve spent your life in baseball and i dont have a very traditional view of the game
hey pete just say it
im not about to beat you up
say what youve always wanted to say to a gm
baseball thinking is medieval
its stuck in the dark ages
i have a more scientific view of the game
keep going peter
there is an epidemic failure within the game to understand whats really happening
and it leads people who run major league teams to misjudge their players and mismanage their teams
theyre still asking the wrong questions
people who run baseball teams still think in terms of buying players
sorry to say that
peter dont apologize for what you believe
the goal shouldnt be to buy players what you want to buy is wins
to buy wins you buy runs
youre trying to replace johnny damon
the red sox look at johnny damon and they see a star worth seven point five million a year
when i look at johnny damon i see an imperfect understanding of where runs come from
archival video the back of johnny damons as jersey as he walks to the plate to adoring oakland fans
his batting average is ignorable
what matters is his on base percentage damon swings at the first pitch and knocks it into left field for a single
he leads off first which in was
thats points lower than league average and points lower than garcias
on the next pitch damon takes off for second true he stole some bases
but attempted steals in general have to succeed of the time before they even start to contribute to run totals
in he cost you runs
damons tagged out at second
hes got a good glove
hes a decent leadoff hitter
he steals bases
but hes not worth the seven point five million boston is paying him
youre lucky to have him off your payroll it opens all kinds of interesting possibilities
you read bill james pete
these ideas and this approach to the game arent all new
in fact some of them have been around for two decades
if this approach has been around for so long why isnt anybody in baseball doing them
thats a much more difficult question than how to win baseball games
once you begin to pull at that string your understanding of the world might begin to unravel
the elevator door closes
billys in coach staring at the night through the window lost in thought
billys mother and father escort martinez and mets head scout roger jongewaard into the kitchen
good to see you again
obviously youre a very special player
wed like to compliment you on your high school career and were looking forward to you being a part of the mets family
jongewaard sits at the kitchen table speaking more to billys parents than billy himself theres good and theres premium
your son is premium
he has it all power speed the arm
the look and im never wrong about that
which is why this is a premium number
he sets a contract on the table
clipped to its top sheet is a check
on its left hand corner is the mets insignia on the right the amount
they all see it
a lot of money in
then billys been offered a scholarship to stanford
and thats a great accomplishment
im sure youre very proud of him
so he can accept that go there and then jongewaard is already shaking his head no
i understand how important college is
but what i cant do is burn a second first round draft pick on someone who cant play for four years no matter how good he is
four years is ample time for someone to get hurt
it happens all the time
it has to be one or the other
to postpone four years is four years he could be in big leagues
the sooner he gets there the sooner he can reap the benefits
stanford or the money
young billy regards the check and then his parents
he really doesnt know what to do
were going to give him a different kind of education
this wont be his lifes career itll be his first career
hes going to be a young guy in the business world when his baseball career is done
hell still have his whole life ahead of him
its your decision billy
whatever you decide is fine with us
billys looking out his window while holding his cordless phone
hes dialed the numbers in and just has to hit the green button
and now he does
peters ringing cell phone wakes him up and he answers it
its billy beane
what time is it
i dont care
would you have drafted me in the first round
after i left you ran me through your computer right
would you have drafted me in the first round
you were a good baseball player
would you have drafted me in the first round
id have drafted you in the ninth round
no signing bonus
youd have passed and gone to stanford
pack your suitcases
i just bought you from the cleveland indians
billy hangs up the phone
he sits all alone for a moment
montage peter pulls into the parking lot for his first day of work takes in the sight of the colossal concrete relic that is the oakland coliseum
hes just in time to see a paint roller on a long pole laying a white stripe down the middle of jason giambis giant portrait
peters completely converted the place
the dry erase boards are covered with undecipherable equations algorithms and numbers and peter whos pretty tired now after not a lot of sleep is in the middle of this
this is what billy sees when he walks into the doorway where he slows down stops and looks around blankly
i asked you to do three
to evaluate three available players
and how many did you do
i dont know why i lied just then
talk me through the wall
peter gets up and gives billy a tour of the dry erase boards
this is the american league west
this year were going to need to win between and games to make the post season
heres the number of runs well need to score in order to win those games and heres the number of runs we can allow
lets make sure were on the same page
were going to re think baseball
look for an inefficiencies in statistics
examine the ways that runs are scored and prevented
exploit the fact that unspectacular runs are just as valuable as foot bombs
unspectacular runs are more valuable
because they cost less
we believe theres a river that hasnt been fished
we know it for sure
and because players have been overlooked because they dont rise to the standards of traditional baseball thinking we believe that in this river there are fish
fish who billy lost it help me with forget the fish
in this room is every available player at every level of professional baseball and somewhere in that group are players that everyone has else has thrown out
an island of misfit toys
in this room is a championship team that we can afford
but let me ask you this
if our theory is right math isnt a theory
if its right its right
it sounds right
it is right
if math isnt a theory it isnt
im gonna punch you in the kidneys if you dont let me finish a sentence
if this is right why isnt everybody doing it
in fact why isnt anybody doing it
somebody once said its not what you dont know that worries me its what you know for sure thats got me scared
in the mid th century in budapest there was an incredibly high instance of mothers dying shortly after childbirth from a disease called puerperal fever
make this story less boring as soon as you can
a doctor named semmelweiss showed that if the attending physicians and nurses sterilized their hands before delivery the mortality rate dropped to
and he was vilified
he was institutionalized
for suggesting that washing your hands before putting them inside someone elses body was a good idea
high functioning people can live under the spell of an inexplicable mental lapse when they think as a group
why isnt anybody else doing it
because they dont think guys who look like you are what win baseball games
they know it for sure
alright lets find our team
peter schleps his computer stuff
sets up plugs in fires up
turns an unused room into a war room with dry erase boards and computers
he installs software in the video room computer works on a computer in his room prints two pages of data and reviews
peter enters and hands the two pages to billy
billy reviews stands then slowly paces as he reads
peter stands and watches
from somewhere in the outfield we have a wide view of the darkened stadium and billys office which unlike the others is illuminated
we can just discern billys silhouette as he continues to slowly pace and study
billy and peter walk down a long subterranean corridor
peter carries a laptop and a slim notebook
peter doesnt know what to make of that
as they near the scouting room billy sees art howe waiting for him outside it
can i talk to you a second before you get started
i got a lot to do
whatever it is billy knows it cant be as dire as his other problems but also knows that to ignore art would be to insult him
he gestures for peter to go into the scouting room alone
hed rather not but does
the scouts assuming perhaps hes there to make coffee ignore him
he finds a place to sit in a corner
whos the kid
i cant manage this team under a one year contract
sure you can
no i cant
ive got to put a team on the field then ill deal with your contract
how about you deal with the managers contract and then put a team on the field
at the moment if a ground ball is hit to first base nobodys going to be there to stop it from rolling
i have to tell you its not easy doing what i do under the cloud of a one year contract
i been there
i know you have
and a year contract says the same thing to a manager as it does to a player theres not a lot of faith there
which is strange after a win season
if you lose the last one of the season nobody gives a shit about the others
its on me now
its on me art
and the kids the new assistant general manager
what the fuck are you about to do
billy doesnt answer the question just walks into the
and ignoring peter who has tried to inconspicuously plant himself in a corner pulls up a chair to receive his scouts report which grady as always will lead
art wanders off
how did it go in cleveland
it was cold
the news bothers no one
lets get after our relief pitching problem
we got chad bradford
few if any of them have heard of bradford and begin leafing through their printouts and notes
thats the one
technically an underhander
whats his velocity
does he have a good breaking ball
doesnt have one
why do you like this guy
well he gets people out
the left hander hitters get a really good look at him
hes down there
hes down there real low too
lets move on
the scouts arent sure what to say and so say nothing
well we i think have fared better
we have some ideas for what to do about giambi
knock me down
we trade power for speed
a rabbit for a gorilla we go for an overachiever
a big heart in the last year his contract
tend to play hard
we usually get a pretty good year out of them
make up for some of the offense we lost
puts more names up or the other option
just a thought
we go for a high maintenance guy
a guy thats a little difficult but talented
a guy like milton bradley
well not like milton
which do you want to talk about first
none of them
grady looks like a man who cant take much more
youre still looking to replace him youre just saying it another way
we got some trades here
we cant do it
what we can do is recreate his value to us in the aggregate
the what giambis on base percentage was
and olmedas bless his heart was
add that up and you get he points to peter
you want me to speak
when i point at you yes
ten ninety two
divided by three three sixty four
thats what were looking for
and thats what well find
three players whose average obp is three sixty four
that doesnt come out right
you gotta carry the one
still dont look right
the others arent sure what confuses them more the logic or the guy who shouldnt be in this room
and thats all hes going to tell them about peter
i dont know how to say this delicately but does peter need to be here
whats with this on base percentage obsession
is that bill james bullshit
you can call it billy beane bullshit for all i care
billy takes a marks a lot jots down three names on strips and approaches the board
so heres who we want
he puts the first strip up
it reads jeremy giambi
jasons little brother jeremy
he never comes home from the games
billy if i may hes had his problems on the field not to mention his problems off the field not to mention hes getting a little thick around the middle
theres the stuff with the weed
hes at strip joints
this guy could start the year with an agent and end up with a parole officer for christs sake
his on base percentage is all were looking at now and he gets on base an awful lot for someone who only costs a year
he cant catch a ball in the outfield
ive seen him lose a ball in the moonlight
billy puts up another name david justice
ten years ago he was a big name
hes going to really help our season tickets at the beginning of the year
but by june hes not going to be hitting his weight
his legs are gone
hes a defensive liability
i question whether the bat speed is still there
steinbrenner is so pissed at his decline hes willing to eat up half his contract to get rid of him
hes a fossil
with all due respect bringing these three guys aboard is like putting bubble gum on a flat tire
and why do we want to be the ones to bail justice out of his contract
billy points at peter he gets on base
i got free agents who are better than those guys
sounds like an oakland a already
yes hes got a little damage in his elbow
he cant throw
were not interested in him for his arm anymore than we wanted giambi for his
wait youre talkin about hatteberg at first
hes a career
hitter and the good part of his career is over
i say its just starting
well billy youll like the sound of this
i hear boston wants to cut him and no one wants to pick him up
thats good news for us
let me understand this
at first base you want a guy whos been cut from half of the minor league teams in the country due to irreparable nerve damage
he cant hit and he cant field but what can he do
look at the piece of paper or im going to point at peter
the scouts consult their spreadsheets and then answer
he can get he can get on base
alright so he walks a lot
he gets on base a lot rocco
do i care if its a walk or a hit
you do not
these three players by your own admission are defective in one way or another
you want to replace jason giambi with not one but three defective players
you got it
billy weve all been busting our asses the last six and a half weeks to make this a better ball cutting him off grady its not a discussion
i think were all losing sight of the fact that youre the general manager
you only have to answer to ownership and god
i didnt know god followed baseball
i hope he does
some of the scouts look over in peters direction no doubt wondering if hes had something to do with their general managers ideas
billy i just dont see it
thats okay wash
we wont be victimized by what we see anymore
i understand what youre saying about their averages but theres something youre forgetting
none of them plays first base
i havent forgotten that wash
one of them is going to have to learn
youre going to have to teach him
a christmas tree
four stockings hang from the mantle
the phone rings
scott hatteberg gets up
he looks at it
looks at his wife
picks it up
its billy beane
scott was expecting that it would be someone else
can we talk
you want to invite me in
i can see you in the window
scott goes to the window and cups his hands against the glass to see outside
two silhouettes are standing on the edge of the fairway
one of them waves
elizabeth is putting out some cookies shaped like stars and bells for the late night guests billy and ron thank you maam
thank you maam
she leaves her husband with the two men but listens in on their conversation from the next room nibbling on a cookie of her own
youve played catcher your whole life
since i was
billy produces a baseball from his windbreaker and hands it to scott
scott can only manage to grip the baseball like a claw
washington looks to heaven
hows the elbow
i cant throw at all
yeah dont worry about it
youve thrown your last baseball from behind the plate
i want you at first
scott is so thrown by this that all he can do is stare at billy
then at washington whos shrug tells scott this wasnt my idea
ive only ever played catcher
youre not a catcher anymore
if you were then mine wouldnt have been the only call you got when your contract expired at midnight
i appreciate it but youre welcome
you dont know how to play first base
its not that hard
tell him wash
its incredibly hard
anything worth doing is
wash is gonna teach you
wait a minute what about jasons gone scott
im taking giambis spot at first
what about the fans
yeah maybe i can teach one of them
the fans dont run back to scott the fans dont run my ball club
theyre gonna hate me
motioning to billy no theyre gonna hate him
the fans love me
hattebergs young daughter comes down the staircase in her pajamas having just woken up in the middle of the night
thats our youngest daughter
do you have kids
billy doesnt like to share personal lives with the players but he covers well yeah i have a daughter
billy takes a contract out of his windbreaker and sets it on the table next to the cookies
this is a contract for you to play baseball with the oakland as
a copys on its way to your agent
discuss it with your wife and let us know
they get up and billy calls off thanks for the cookies maam
we see elizabeth with tears running down her face
then go back to the living room youre welcome
on his way out merry christmas
the door of a suburban house opens revealing a woman
she pulls the door open so he can come in
as he does she home
shes out but shell be home soon
as billy enters his ex wife sharons house her husband alan walks in talking on the phone
yeah no dont worry about it sweetie
alan hands sharon the phone
come on in have a seat
want some coconut water
its really refreshing
im all set thanks
what are you benching now
i dont keep count
well whatever it is its working
you look good
they sit on the couch next to a christmas tree
i havent got to see you since the playoffs in new york
that was heartbreaking billy
we were rooting for you
you know what i say
im sorry alan what do you say
no i just wanted to say that a lot of teams dont get that far and to make it that far is a really big accomplishment
sharon gets off the phone and joins them
so how is she
be here in a minute
hows the team shaping up
i read that you lost two players
wow thats tough
thats really tough
so where is she
i just talked to her on her cell
shes just coming up the hill shes two minutes away
you bought her a cell phone
just for emergencies
im sorry we should have consulted you for that its probably a good idea
but actually i called you the front door opens
its billys daughter casey a pre teen indie rock girl and not a moment too soon
hes up quickly to give her a hug and to get out of here
lets go shopping
billy and casey peruse guitars
you want one with nylon strings right
i like the red ones
how about this
yeah thats cool
lets try it out over here
they take a seat
casey easily fingers through a very tough spray of notes
you got good
ive just been playing a lot
thats not the way most year olds play
alan thinks i should have a better teacher
casey looks at him oh yeah
whats wrong with the teacher you have now
alan thinks i should be working more on technique so i dont learn bad habits
well you seem to be doing just fine to me
do you like playing
i love it
thats so great
im so happy for you
the most important thing in life is to find something you love and do it well
do you like your teacher
okay ill talk to mom and alan
do you like that guitar
that the one
yeah i think so
lets get it
lets get it now
billys at the plate a batting helmet snug around his head wearing a mets uniform as a mph fastball buzzes by him and the umpire calls striiike
billy steps out of the box taps the dirt off his cleats and steps back in
a younger looking sharon is sitting in field level seats looking on nervously and trying not to show it
billy half swings at the breaking ball holding his swing at the last minute
the catcher and plate umpire both point down to first base for the call and the first base umpire makes a fist in the air indicating that billy swung
and billys out
sharon holds her head in her hands and billy walks back to the dugout passing a player with strawberry on his back
and now the quick scenes of failure become staccato billy playing for minor league tidewater and he grounds billy playing for minor league toledo
he swings and pops up lamely to the pitcher throwing his bat down in frustration as he jogs hopelessly to first and we billy beane whos quickly establishing a new
record for breaking bats bat racks and water coolers was actually a much touted first round pick of the new york mets in but the majors have not been kind to him with only plate appearances in two years and this wont doing anything to help him as
billy playing for the minnesota twins where he comes back into the dug out and throws his batting helmet down and
billy playing for minor league portland and a water cooler goes flying across the dugout and one of two first round picks in along with daryl strawberry beane was brought
up last year and sent back down after at bats so heres a second chance as smith delivers
billy playing for the minnesota twins
he swings hard at a pitch and strikes out and we billy playing for the detroit tigers and the bat rack gets heaved across the field and if youre a
real baseball fan with a good memory you might remember that billy beane was taken in the first round of the amateur draft back in separated from all star outfielder daryl strawberry by only picks so it just goes to show
billy in an as uniform
he stands and watches a called third strike sail past him
billy breaks the bat over his thigh and drops the pieces on the plate
he begins to walk off
hey billy clean up after yourself
billy hears him but continues to walk off
billy looks up at sharon in the seats behind the dugout but the two cant quite meet each others eyes
in the subterranean video room an even less elegant place than the rest of the stadium someone has put up a scraggly christmas tree
there peter watches a tape of a minor leaguer on the lowell spinners a single a boston affiliate
billy comes in
howd it go
howd what go
he can barely hold a baseball
but hes our guy now
that is kevin youkilis
this is the guy we want more than anyone else in the world
billy watches the guy on the screen
hes an overweight right handed batter with a peculiar stance
he cant run throw or field
but he walks more than anyone in baseball except barry bonds
take out intentional walks and its more than bonds
hes the greek god of walks
on the tv the batter takes another pitch just off the edge of the strike zone
i tried to get shapiro to draft him last june
he said he waddled like a duck
boston took him
boston wont let him go yet
theyre going to wait and see
they watch him lay off a pitch an inch outside the strike zone
peter gives billy a look that says you see that
you all right billy
grady has appeared behind them at the door
can we talk a minute
grady closes the video room door for privacy
the only other person in sight is manager art howe in his office in street clothes
he shuts his windowed door so grady and billy can talk in confidence
your boy and i had a talk while you were in tacoma
i didnt like much of what i heard
you got a kid in there with a yale economics degree and a scout out here with years baseball experience and youre listening to the wrong one
i dont listen to anyone you know that
this isnt a joke
im not joking
this isnt how you run a ball club with a computer
you know that
youre a baseball man
there are intangibles that only a scout can see in a player that youre not going to pick up with just numbers with someone who doesnt play the game who
knows nothing about the game but how to feed numbers into a computer
thats what were doing
thats exactly what were doing
if this is what baseball is if its not kirk gibson going up to the plate on two bad legs because the manager felt in his heart that he had
one swing left in that body
a computer wouldnt do that
they would have had him sitting up in the stands
a computer doesnt romanticize the sport
leave that for the fans
well romance and the fans its called a love affair with the game and its been going on for one hundred and fifty years
i dont want to hurt you love affair with the game
just because weve been doing it one way for a hundred and fifty years doesnt mean weve been doing it right
you have any idea how long people thought the sun revolved around the earth
to your eyes it looks like thats whats happening
youre saying everybodys been wrong
are you saying everybodys been wrong
yes and ive thought so my whole life
and now were gonna see if im were gonna see if youre right
this is about you and your shit
some scouts from years ago called it wrong okay
they thought you were a ballplayer and you werent
as you know it happens
dont take it out on im not taking it out on im trying to help okay im saying no youre not saying anything to me right now
grady you dont have special powers
you dont have the ability to look at a guy and just know because youre a scout with special powers
ive watched you sit at kitchen tables for years and tell the parents of a year old kid trust me when i know i know and when it comes to
your son i know and you dont
were shopping in a new store full of complicated statistical analysis and equations and i get that it turns your world upside down but on base percentage our best chance
to score on our budget isnt getting a adonis to the plate its getting a washout whos already at first base
may i speak
major league baseball and its fans will be happy to hand you and google boy your heads if you keep doing what youre doing here i dont give a shit
about friendship this situation or the past
major league baseball thinks the way i think
youre not gonna win
and ill give you a nickels worth of free advice
youre making it impossible for yourself to get another job once schott fires you after this catastrophic season youre setting us all up for and youre gonna have to explain
to your wife and your kid why youre working at dicks sporting goods
im not gonna fire you grady
go fuck yourself billy
well now maybe
grady takes off
billy stands there a moment
on his way out passing arts windowed office he exchanges a look with the manager
billy takes a short walk to where a few of his scouts are standing around an arcade console
to the youngest one eric
you never even played high school ball right
the young scout shakes his head embarrassed
youre the new head scout
billy turns away and is headed back to the video room
pokes his head in
dont try to explain things to scouts
theyre not programmed to get it
its just us
peter watches the door close then glances back to the tape as youkilis takes ball four and waddles down to first base
team jumbotron photos are taken of our new as
its clear from the photo billy didnt hire them to sell jeans
legend march spring training
billy gives an interview to a sports reporter
billy will the fans still come out now that youve lost giambi
i dont know graham
will they listen to your insipid radio show
mike magnante goes through the effort of putting on his knee braces
scott hatteberg lacing up watches him
various stations have been set up at which infielders go through their warm ups wind sprints arm loosening
infielders field grounders hit by art howe from a fungo
billy paces in the foul territory off the first base line
his pov jeremy giambi missing a fly ball david justice looking tired hatteberg missing the scoop
art hits another grounder which hatteberg botches again
art looks at billy a good long beat then hits to another infielder
peter walks up to billy just as a poke off the bat sends jeremy giambi scrambling back like a postman trying to escape a mad dog
the ball lands behind him
well we didnt pay him for his defense
art and washington hit grounders to carlos pena and scott hatteberg
hatteberg miraculously gets his mitt on it
thats the way hatte
behind a portable backstop a guy with a radar gun gets ready to clock a trio of relievers
mike magnante has his pant legs pulled up to adjust knee braces
magnante gets up and begins throwing increasing his velocity each time
none of those broke
they watch the second pitcher the gentle faced kid from the locker room chad bradford step up
chad i have high hopes for
bradford overthrows his first submarine hand scraping the ground pitch and the ball sails wide of the catcher
art howe glances with a long suffering look to billy
it just got away from him
they watch david justice do wind sprints
hes still got it
then justice stops winded
as the players shower and change into street clothes art billy and washington discuss hatteberg who knows theyre discussing him
its the first day of week one
theres nothing to judge yet
i can judge it and so can you
first base is the moon to him
it wasnt to giambi
hes the worst first baseman in baseball
what do you think of him wash
the nicest way i can put it is he lacks confidence
work with him wash
ill do that billy but weve got pena who can play first
and hes looking pretty good out there
i want to make it work with hatte wash
as washington crosses the locker room to lie to scott about how much progress hes making he passes magnante taking off his knee braces and chad bradford sitting at his
locker with a bible in his lap
not to mention we already have a first baseman
a rookie first baseman
its not the same
number on the top prospects list
lists arent baseball
catchers at first base arent baseball
whos idea was this
hatteberg will be fine art
he will be fine youre right
pinch hitting while pena plays first base
a towering portrait of david justice has been painted where jason giambis used to be
the hardest diehard fans file under it and through the turnstiles
you know what they look like dripping as merchandise radios and sharpies arriving so early the b
cage is still being dragged into place
indicate the arrival of opening day
including foul lines are painted broadcast trucks plug in the network control room fires up announcers do their prep steve schott lands in his helicopter
legend april opening day in the locker room players prepare
magnante puts on his knee braces
been doing it for way too long
how long does it take
when i first started these things
it was like a half hour process
now i can knock these suckers out in seconds no problem
jeremy giambis boombox is on again as he and his teammates suit up
year old david justice wanders past to a soda machine
presses a button but nothing comes out
is a dollar mang
always been like that here
youre kidding me right
welcome to oakland
billy and peter walk through
he walks past chad bradfords locker
excuse me mr
i hope im not disturbing you
youre not whats up
i wanted to say thanks for the opportunity
its gonna work out well for both of us
nobody in the major league ever took me seriously
just you sir
its a big day you wont forget it
im going to pray for you and your family
peter follows billy out of the locker room
shots of the game announcers
ken korach greg papa and glen kuiper welcome the fans to opening day discuss the as lineup and the problems they face this season
its fifteen minutes before the game as some executives have their picture taken on the field with billy
hey great to see you
thanks for coming out
got a good box
you want a picture
sure let me step in there
great big smiles now
know what i like about opening day
you all enjoy the game
billy gets his picture taken with kids from an area little league team
hes laughing and being a good host
hey how you guys doing
so you won
what position are you
hows your fastball
alright should we get a pic
billy and the little league team pose with a giant donation check
the announcer then directs everyones attention to a trophy ceremony in progress
as chavez receives his golden glove award and smiles for the fans
billy greeting some vips in their field level seats
throughout this well hear bits of talk radio
with the departure of head scout grady fuson and a roster that ill describe as unusual if not eccentric you have to wonder what billy beane is thinking
billy catches a glance of elizabeth hatteberg taking her seat nearby
in the family area elizabeth introduces herself to tara
hi im elizabeth
which is yours
catcher actually first base actually we dont know
hes a saint
art is talking to a journalist
are they picking up your option for next year
i brought it up to them during the off season and i still do not have my option
are you frustrated
i think its fair to say that
art howe stands mid field as the starting lineup is announced
one by one players join him on the field
the honor guard presents the flag as everyone stands for the national anthem
afterward the players scatter to warm up for the game
the crowd cheers as the as take the field
billy and peter are at the edge of the tunnel watching
im heading in
i dont watch the games
is this a joke
billy shakes his head no
peter gestures what the fuck are you talking about
i dont know what youre miming
im miming you dont watch the games
this is my team
and theyve taken the field
theyre world class athletes who are fighting for their lives and i stand with them
except not literally so i need you to text me what art does
billy walks out onto billys watching the game on tv archival video with the sound off but we can hear the live crowd in the stadium
crack a texas ranger hits a three run homer and billy walks out of the room and an oakland a hits an easy pop up to center field and where
billys on a stationary bike
his blackberry buzzes and he takes a look fly out to cntr where billys bench pressing and crack where an oakland a has just hit a ground ball to the
shortstop who tosses it easily to second for the first out and the second baseman throws it over to first for where billy looks at the blackberry which now says
the blackberry goes crashing into the wall and blows apart
we find billy and art in conversation
i should have made you a bigger part of the conversation i should have had you in the scout meetings from the first day that way you would have understood
this better and that was another mistake i take full responsibility
what are you trying to say
it doesnt matter what moves i make if you dont play the team the way i need them played
you are out of your depth
why wasnt hatteberg at first
because he cant play first
how do you know
not my first baseball game
scott hatteberg cant hit
he gets on
and his defense still keeps us in the plus column and we only need to be over
yeah i would have rather seen chad bradford in there at the end than magnante
i dont care about righty lefty
this is about your contract
no youve made it clear what you think about that
this is about you doing your job and me doing mine
mines being left alone to manage the beer league team you assembled for me
i didnt assemble them for you i assembled them for me
i want you to go on the road with the team
you dont go on the road with the team
thats why i want you to do it
why dont you
i dont want to develop personal relationships
i need to trade them send them down and sometimes cut them
you should learn how to do that by the way
the only way id have to cut a player is if you oh come on
yeah lets practice
im a player cut me from the roster
this is stupid
man up yale
billy would you have a seat for a moment i need to talk to you
im already sitting
i was pretending you werent sitting
but i am
this is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball
you got that from bull durham
hitting a curve ball is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball but go ahead
youve been a huge part of this team but decisions have to be made that are best for the team im sure you can understand that
youre cutting me
im really sorry
i just bought a house here
thats all you have to say
my kids just started at a new school they made friends
thats id leave them in school you dont want to take them out in the middle what the hell are you doing
are you you or the player
youre talking about kids and schools and you shouldve been out of the room three minutes ago
shouldnt i tell them that theyll always be a part of the as family
that makes me feel so good im thinking of burning your house down with you in it
these are professional baseball players
you just do it
peter i need to let you go
jacks officell handle the paperwork
would you rather get one bullet in the head or five in the chest and bleed to death
those are my only choices
go on the road with the team
jeremy giambi discreetly mixes a highball from a cache of hotel minibar liquor bottles as he watches his favorite movie on a portable dvd player the natural
david justice is sitting next to peter who scrolls down stats on his laptop
how come your boss doesnt travel with the team
he doesnt like to mingle with the players
makes us easier to cut
peter doesnt say anything
hes gonna make some moves if we keep losing
peter gives a small yeah shrug
how come soda costs a dollar in the clubhouse
billy likes to keep the money on the field
peter doesnt say anything
where on the field is the dollar i pay for soda
its hard to see
shaking his head alright
billy watches the t
on tv pena taking his place at first
the as begin their first road trip of the season having dropped of their first games at home and their schedule doesnt get any easier from here
if theres a bright spot its rookie first baseman carlos pena
billy turns off the t
gets beeper updates as he works out
with the as getting off to a miserable start of their last of their last etc
billys waiting for someone
hes watching the as game by the gate
a passenger also watching the game recognizes billy
hey arent you billy beane
shouldnt you be at the game
casey emerges from the gate sees her father before he sees her and runs to him
im glad to see you
billy and peter are throwing a ball through their office doors on either side of the hallway its not a big enough sample yet
i want to wait until we play more games
billy watches the game from the office t
he sees david justice grounds into a double play to end the game
and justice hits into the double play to end the game
the indians trot on the field to high five each other
casey sits at the table as billy scoops ice cream
do you want strawberry or vanilla
dont tell your mother
if you could only have one ice cream for the rest of your life which would you choose
if you could choose between the power of invisibility or flight which would you choose
yeah id wanna fly
i think id want invisibility
i dont know
people wouldnt notice me as much
why wouldnt you want people to notice you
i dont know
well i guess you could sneak up on people
or eavesdrop on their conversations
you could be a spy
so hows school
my teachers kinda mean
she doesnt like us to ask questions
what kind of teacher doesnt let you ask questions
i know right
mom was mad too
she thinks maybe i should be home schooled
wouldnt you miss your friends
but the other kids are mean
there are always going to be bullies
try not to let them get to you
but let me know if its becoming a problem
can i ask you a question
are you still chewing tobacco
i know its terrible
look i promise ill quit in november if you promise not to worry about it
theoretically when weve played more games the numbers will become more theoretically
the scoreboard shows the as down by in the th
as art trudges toward the mound to pull his starter he touches his left arm
magnante emerges from the pen and peter up in a vip box flips open his phone
billy is saying goodbye to casey
billys blackberry chimes
he ignores it
i feel like you feel like what
i dont know did we talk enough this time
did we talk about the things you want to talk about did we have fun
i love you dad
youre doing it right now
youre worrying about me
do i look like im worried
cause youre getting on an airplane and those things crash all the time
will you please stop worrying about your father
youre a kid i cant have it
can i worry about the airplane now though
a flight attendant approaches were all set
theres a slightly awkward moment and casey isnt sure whether shes supposed to hug her father again and so they do a sort of half hug
i love you
billy watches her go off with the attendant feeling like it was an unsatisfying visit
he looks at his blackberry
why is he in there
everyone in the area stops to look at the madman
to the people looking at him no no
billy runs the warning track with a small radio that he turns on long enough to follow whats happening and switches it off again
over the following we hear a cacophony of radio and tv voices tumbling into each other
the as have fallen to
magnate giving up a save blowing hit while bradford sits in the bullpen
an oakland a hits into a double play strike out caught stealing picked off first a lop sided scoreboard half the parking lot is a vast empty black sea with
just two pin points of moving light
billy drives around the lot like a downhill skier with nothing in his way his daughters mix tape playing
jeremy lines a single to right but is so slow hes almost thrown out at first
art howe glances at his bench coach ken macha
art howe is the only manager in baseball who has to think about pinch running his leadoff hitter
down in the visitors pen chad sits with mike magnante
why do you do it
i cant not do it
how do you do it
every ball parks different
i take that into account and adjust the distance of my steps
exactly seventy four from the pen to the mound
you should get that looked at man
the team in the dugout hanging their heads during a peter erases the percentage of games left they need to win and writes in a higher number and hes listening
to the radio
after sundays rout
now having dropped of the as are a game away from being swept at home by the al east last place baltimore orioles
as we follow billys truck from oakland over the bay bridge into san francisco
you remember peter
guys give me some idea of whats going on out there
listen its a team of probabilities and were gonna need games to tell that tale in a nascent form
its phase one were evolving and we feel confident where were heading
were not scared
out of games
were getting crucified in the press
what makes you think this is gonna turn around
because i believe in what were doing
i believe the numbers
i believe the record doesnt accurately reflect the team and where were going to be at the end of the season
peter and i feel very strongly that we need to stick to the game plan and you can tell your partners to start booking their tickets to the playoffs
billy look youve got guys who are nearly crippled who couldnt get hired as an usher in a ballpark now playing on the team
give me something i can go back to these guys with and feel like i have the confidence that youre gonna turn these things around
with all due respect you asked me to build a team with shoelaces and gum wrappers and weve done it
you havent done it yet billy
and it will pay off
stick with us
suffer the blows
listen life with no money means were gonna have to suffer a few embarrassments along the way but we are okay in the end
billy theres a lot of money at stake here
and a lot of people with vested interest in seeing this be successful
ive given you a lot of flexibility
when are we gonna start to see a change in these results
schott sits back at his desk
give me a date give me a time frame
where do we expect to be mid july all star break
our goal and our expectation by the all star break is to be within seven games of first place
thatll keep us in the hunt
and that would be this working exceptionally well
and whats going to keep us from getting there
were for right now
youve got to be able to give me a little bit more to go back to my partners with
listen you hired me to do this job and thats where were going to be
thats not good enough
well lets go buy barry bonds then
this is the team weve got and this is the team well win with
billy put yourself in my shoes
what do you imagine is going to happen if things dont turn around
its very clear steve
if i put myself in your shoes id spend another million on the team
we dont have another million im just kidding steve im just kidding
weve got the team
i gotta be honest with you billy i wish you had a little more worry and a little more fear
because things arent going in our direction right now
lets hope the next are better than the last
i dont need to hope
all right fellas
lets go try and win one
were in may weve got til july
the as take batting practice
legend may art as he always does is watching not from the railing but from the bench
billy walks into the dugout without saying hello
were not gonna lose three at home to the orioles
i want dye in right justice dh ing pena on the bench hatteberg at first and anyone but magnante first out of the pen
you want pena on the bench
so that you can play hatteberg
hatte as opposed to the guy whos going to win rookie of the year
no hatte as opposed to the guy who gets on base less
pena getting voted rookie of the year and the as making the playoffs are two entirely different penas not just the best first baseman on the roster hes the only
first baseman on the roster and the most valuable member on this team
not according to what do you call em facts
listen to me gets on base more than pena
his fielding doesnt matter
it does matter and pena only has one error in games
not only is that number statistically insignificant but its also subjective
it measures what someone did against what someone else thought they were supposed to do
part of the conversation
ive heard enough of the conversation and i disagree with you plain and simple
moreover i strongly believe that youre in the middle of experiencing some sort of personal crisis and you seem indifferent to the fact that youre taking a whole organization down
im playing my team in a way i can explain in job interviews this winter
some as players arrive in the dugout causing billy to hold his tongue
he simply says hatte not pena
the game plays silently on the tv as billy lifts weights
not wanting to watch but not being able not to he looks at the screen to see pena trotting out to first base
the orioles bench clears to high five the players coming off the field
the game is over and obviously theyve won
the as exit their dugout to the tunnels
as art crosses to his office he sees billy waiting inside it with a towel around his neck
he hesitates then goes in and we follow him
billy says nothing but his silence is worse
art has to break it its just one game
thats the point you think
the point is always tomorrows game
no the point as you said is to win
i dont like sharing the cellar with texas do you
we hear funk music begin to play in the distance
im doing the best i can with what ive got
im playing the players ive got
im through talking
billy lets himself out and walks down the hall to the locker room regards jeremy giambi yeah
hes not even aware of billy
its just like any other night as far as jeremy giambi is concerned
he dances to a cd of funk music as he dresses until he becomes aware of billy standing there and smiling he kills the music
getting swept by the red sox at home
having long lead off the ninth with a triple in a one run game and not being able to score a runner from first with nobody out is that fun
then what the fuck are you having fun for
this is what losing sounds like
he heads out
point below the al average field which isnt bad
peter rattles off player stats
what do you think
i dont know where i am
i missed my exit
billy takes the next off ramp and as lights flare on the windshield we transition to another time young billy billy and his wife drive home from a game in
silence their infant daughter casey asleep in a car seat in back
sharon regards billys hands clutched too tightly to the steering wheel
have you thought about what you might do if baseball doesnt work out
that was too abrupt
if baseball doesnt work out
have you thought about what you might do
the games only been over for three hours i havent had that much time to think about it
maybe real estate
ill be honest if i dont make it in baseball i dont think im going to be able to afford much real estate
i know what you meant
its just a slump right
youre saying every scout was wrong
youre kind of saying it too
dont you think you should divorce me now while youre young
sharon looks at him
then her eyes go to the window
when a science experiment fails in a lab things blow up
problems are the price you pay for progress
branch rickey billy shoves a wad of copenhagen under his lip as he and peter walk and talk
get me wade
billys seated at his desk
peter reluctantly dials a number from a list the number across from the phillies gms name
it connects on the speaker
i need some help on defense and im willing to trade jeremy giambi for it
no you arent ignoring peter to who you got
let me think
what are you doing
jeremys doing cleaning house
put the call on mabry
i dont know
yes you do
runs hot and cold billy
impossible to know what were going to get
hes a crap shoot
hes exactly the kind of player were not looking for
into the phone hell be fine ed
why do i get the feeling youre picking my pocket
im not picking your pocket youre picking mine
giambis name alone is worth more than mabry
his career is stagnant to put it nicely
can we say its done in theory and start drawing up paperwork
he hangs up
i think he was going to say something else
rule number when you get the answer youre looking for hang up
thats done and in a minute penas going to detroit
i dont think you want to do that
art cant put him at first if hes playing for the tigers and i want hatte in the lineup tonight
maybe you should think about this
youre upset and this is this what am i missing
its just a very hard move to explain
people are going to think youve lost your mind
whys that a problem peter
dont make an emotional decision billy
david dombrowskis on
billy picks up the call
sometimes you have to shake it up
david penas going on the blocks youre my first call
because hes making the rest of the team look bad
hes going to be rookie of the year
not eager to help but
probably an all star
hes an all star dave
winks at peter its more like hes creating self esteem problems for the other guys
no im looking for a reliever and some cash
five minutes dave im not waiting
whats the problem
trying to slow it billy pena is an all star
if you dump him and if hatte doesnt work out you know this is the kind of decision that gets you fired
why you worrying about my job
you worried about my job or yours
im worried about yours
well you should be worrying about yours because if this thing were doing dont work
neither of us have jobs
thats probably true
in which case im a year old guy with a high school diploma and a daughter who id like to be able to put through college one day
lets it sink in youre years old with a degree from yale and a pretty impressive apprenticeship
i dont think were asking the right question
i think the question were supposed to be asking now is do you believe in what were doing or not
its a problem that you think we need to explain ourselves
im going to see this through for better or for worse
just tell me do you project well win more games with pena or hatteberg on first
its close billy but theoretically hatteberg
what are we talking about then
the phone rings
theres just one more thing i need
i dont want the guys paying for soda i want you to stock my soda machine for three years
uh huh uh huh great
then thats a deal
billy hangs up
he stares at peter
that was thoughtful
you gotta tell pena to pack
you want me to tell pena hes been traded
be a man
what about jeremy
am i telling him too
ill do that
peter walks into the locker room
sees pena talking to a couple of other players
he approaches pena
can i get a moment with you
okay maybe we can talk over here
they walk awkwardly to the players lounge
have a seat
so um carlos youve been traded to the tigers
this is the number of jay palmer their travel secretary
hes expecting your call
hell help you arrange travel to detroit
pena sits and stares at him
its excruciating for peter awkward until is that all
pena just takes it
picks up the number and leaves
billy knocks and lets himself in
mind if i have a seat
you cant start pena at first tonight youll have to start hatteberg
i dont want to go rounds billy the line up card is mine and thats all
the line up card is definitely yours im just saying you cant start pena at first
i am starting pena at first
i dont think so he plays for the detroit tigers now
you traded pena
along with german hiljus and jeremy giambi
you are outside your fucking mind
art stares at him in a silence broken by jeremy giambi knocking on the open door
jeremy come on in
billy jots a phone number on an as post it and hands it to him
this is ed wades number
you know him
art looks sick
phillies general manager
real nice guy
give him a call hes expecting it say hello then talk to futterman about arranging a flight for you
billy gets up and shakes his hand
its been a real pleasure jeremy
i mean that
youre a great ballplayer and great guy
jeremy not sure he heard right looks at the post it in his hand as billy escorts him to the door
were going to miss you
billy looks at art from the door
adkins is gone too
youre killing this team
i can do this all day long
art notices peter who had been lurking by the door eavesdropping
what are you looking at
im not looking at anything
you went along with this
you agree with this bullshit
a hundred percent
pena cleans out his locker
several players stop by to say goodbye
tejada keep your head up okay
its part of the business
youre gonna be a great player okay
thank you man
dont let this bother you at all
chad bradford nice to meet you brother
take care and
god bless you man
scott hatteberg youre the best first baseman here
its not right carlos
thank you hattie
billy and peter stride through as the team is getting dressed for batting practice
the place quiets down as billy comes in
theyve all heard the news and theyve never experienced a move like this in their careers
go out and field some grounders
billy looks around at the players who are looking at billy
everybody listen up
you may not look like a winning ball team
in fact you look nothing like a winning ball team
but you are one
so play like one tonight
youll get further instructions tomorrow
david justice hits a single up the middle as the runners on nd and rd round the bases to score
billys blackberry buzzes
sngl up the mdl rns scr okay
billy talks to chavez and ellis
peter stands nearby
no more bunts
no more bunts
a bunt is an out
youre paid to avoid outs not make them
a bunt isnt an out
its a sacrifice
a bunt is for pitchers and weak hitters
youre not a pitcher chavvie so what are you saying
until the third out anything can happen
after the third out its over
you gotta protect your outs like theyre your children
every outs precious dont give em away
another thing you should see more pitches
we wanna get into their bullpen
deep into their bullpen
we want to see pitches by the end of the th inning
you wanna get your at bats off their th and th pitcher
you want us to walk more
how much more
at least once every ten at bats
triple a sacramentos only miles away
and theres no flights
as they look to dont look at him
heres the deal
im not interested in what you think you know about baseball or what you think i dont know about it
im not interested in guts or heart or determination or anything else the fans or your mothers love about you
im interested in you getting on base
if you do that we win
if you dont we lose
and i hate to lose
i hate to lose more than i need to win
theres a difference
billy and peter give advice to dye and byrnes
every at bat is like a hand of blackjack
every card thats dealt your odds completely change
for instance every first pitch strike your batting average goes down about points
every first pitch ball it goes up about the same amount
so you gotta lay off the first pitch
first pitch curveball or first pitch fastball
first pitch period
when you swing at the first pitch youre batting
we want to see more pitches
how many pitches
every starter we want to see pitches by the th inning
pitches per at bat
i mean hatteberg drained pitches
and byrnsie youre hackin at everything
youre all squirrely out there
wait for your pitch man
this is a war of attrition
theres no clock on this thing
wait em out
let them make the mistakes
and when your enemys making mistakes dont interrupt them
peter advises durham as he works out
basically these are all your at bats
this is you versus righties you versus lefties
and then of course all your count knowledge okay
in an count youre batting
in an you average
when youre youre batting
understand what im saying
i know its a lot of math
when your first pitch is a strike your batting average goes down about points
when its a ball it goes up about
if you draw a ball on your first pitch youre unstoppable
if you strike on the first pitch you might as well be jumping off cliff
im trying to get you to lay off the first pitch
but im a first pitch hitter
i like to swing at fastballs
and thats the way youve been trained
but its a habit wed like to break you from
were trying to design the game to your strengths
this has nothing to do with you being a great hitter youre a great hitter
we just want to get you on base
but if i get my pitch im gonna swing at it no matter what the count is
im not worried about you crushing the ball out of the park
i just want you to lay off anything that will result in a strike
i guess ill have to watch some film and take a look at it
the video room is open to you any time im always available
billy and peter with a group of players around the card table post game
make him use up all his bullets
yeah make him work
nah make it mr
beane im screwin with you haddie
so we just dont steal
thats what i do
thats what you pay me to do
no i pay you to get on first not get thrown out at second
i dont get thrown out much
i dont hit on at the blackjack table but if i did the odds would be the same
youve actually gotten caught out of tries this season
i get of
thats not bad
you just handed them an out
protect your outs like theyre your children
theres no clock on this game
until the third out anything can happen
get on base and let the next guy move you up
pass the torch pass the torch
were like a machine
a run making machine
as justice and hatteberg prepare food whats your biggest fear
a baseball being hit in my general direction
ive been thinking
i want you to you gonna teach me something
ive never seen a gm talk to players
youve never seen a gm who was a player
is there a problem
its okay man
i know your routine
its a patter its rap its for effect
but its for them its not for me
youre paying me million bucks so i guess i am a little
as a matter of fact im not paying you million bucks david
the yankees are paying half your salary
thats what the new york yankees think of you
theyre paying you three and a half million dollars to play against them
if this is news to justice he doesnt show it
where are you going with this billy
youre almost dave
almost as old as me
lets be honest with each other about what we each want
i want to milk the last ounce of baseball you have left in you and you want to stay in the show
so lets do that
im not paying you to be the player you used to be im paying you to be the player you are now
youre smart you know whats going on here
i need you to set an example for the younger guys
take a leadership role
justice just studies him
billy starts to leave but has one last thought for him you know the yankees are coming to town
if it were me id want to take that three point five and shove it up their ass
but im a competitor
justice calls after him you know i got a couple world series rings
i think im a pretty good competitor too
you want another one
david justice takes ball four from a yanks pitcher tosses his bat to the side and trots down to first base
tejada is on first and taking a big lead toward second
he wants to steal it bad
tejada taking a big lead off first eyeing the steal billy watches with two or three team employees
dont do it migs
and crack a base hit sends tejada to rd
billys blackberry buzzes sngl to lft
frst and thrd nobody out
the wheels of the team jet lift off the tv is on as billy and peter work seeming more and more like mad scientists who are getting closer and closer
to splitting the atom
what is happening in oakland
the as have won seven in a row and of their last
you got to hand it to art howe
hes managing this unorthodox team in an unorthodox way
they are not bunting
they are not stealing
they are just winning
and art howe is the reason
did you hear that
i heard in a row
billy clicks off the tv and its very quiet
billy is scrolling down numbers that show trends and comparisons of all of the as relief pitching
can you show me righty lefty matchups for the division and overall versus mariners
peter reaches over and with a few clicks produces new columns of numbers upon which billy darts his eyes as he scrolls through them
he gets up and heads out
billy walks through the clubhouse shouting locker room shoutouts to players as he walks by
pointing back down that smell is getting worse
im on it billy
what are we doing tonight
splitting the plate in half
to hudson playing huddy you gotta mix it up tonight
trust your slider
to the others you guys stop distracting him
chavvie you couldnt hit that shit with a boat paddle last night
you gotta see more pitches
you got it billy
as billy crosses through the weight room hey david hey man
great at bats
billy knocks on arts door something we havent seen him do before
art can see billy through the window blinds and is a little surprised at the courtesy of a knock
hes going to try to do this nicely
how are ya
i did and i hope you take it as a show of respect
you look good
weve won in a row what am i doing wrong now
magnantes having some head problems
hes and hes got three blown saves in two weeks
everytime he winds up hes thinking hes about to throw the last pitch of his life
so he grips it a little hard
i appreciate this
but i know my bullpen
yes you do
yes you absolutely do
no question about it
except not really
if we have a lead late in the game and they have runners on base id rather not see magnante out of the bullpen
ill make that decision when the time comes
thats what you should do
baseballs a game of situations and you should make the decision when the time comes
except you should make it now
dont bring magnante out if weve gotta hold a late lead with runners on
hes hes scared shitless of being the guy who blows this winning streak
you think a lot of yourself dont you
think the regular amount of myself
magnante on the other hand he doesnt think very much of himself at all and when he tightens up weve got ourselves an adventure
so id like to see chad bradford out of the pen tonight when were in lets say just to make it easier for you any situation
righty lefty two outs no outs the umpires have decided were going to finish the game by playing darts whatever
bradfords the first guy out of the pen
art regards billy for a moment
i couldve coached you up you know
i dont think so
you think you went as far as you could have
yeah thats what i meant
billy steps out of arts office into the game plays on tv as billy bench presses
the as are up by three runs in the ninth inning but the indians have a runner on first
through the tunnel billy can hear the crack of the bat and a collective groan from the stands
billy holds the barbell in the air frozen as he simply looks at the t
and sees the silent images
art howe walking to the mound tapping his left hand
magnante heading to the mound
we think billys going to trash the weights but he simply returns the barbell to the bracket sits up and watches the silent images
magnante mops his brow squints for the sign winds up and makes his pitch
it misses low for ball four and pedro walks to first
billy lays back on the bench breathes then unmutes the t
and we hear magnante has quickly let two on base for lee stevens whos the go ahead run for the indians in a game that oakland appeared to have put
and then billy sits calmly
waits for it
and billy nods his head at the inevitable
that ball is deep
three run homer for lee stevens to put cleveland ahead in the ninth inning
billy can hear people booing their lungs out
he takes a moment then grabs his jacket
the fans are booing as art makes his way to the mound to take magnante out
bradford makes his way from the bullpen and takes the ball from art
art turns to head back to the dugout but slows as he sees a strange sight billy is standing at the dugout rail
the plate umpire notices and follows arts line of sight
he sees billy and walks over there ahead of art
you cant be in there billy
billy doesnt move
he just watches art as he comes into the dugout
the players are watching to see whats going to happen
billy puts his hand on arts shoulder a second as he says just nod a little bit not too much like im assuring you you didnt just make a calamitous
players and coaches only billy
ignoring the umpire still quietly to remember that in about four seconds billy sees one of the nearby tv cameras pivot over to catch this conversation yeah there it is
were the lead story on sports center now so let me be brief
first of all that was an awfully costly fuck you wouldnt you say
second of all genius those boos
theyre for you
come on billy
get me this game back
as billy passes magnante he pats his back before we the radio is on and the announcer is telling us after giving up the lead on a three run homer
off magnante the as came right back to win it in the bottom of the ninth with another three run homer by miguel tejada
and the as have won eight in a row
as the early bird fanatics arrive players arrive at the players entrance magnante walks into the as locker room
billy standing at the door surveys the room his eyes moving from player to player as theyre hanging up their street clothes
the teams equipment manager pouring himself a cup of coffee glances over you want one billy
im good voos
voos wanders off
billy keeps looking at the players
legend july trade deadline billy comes in sticking some tobacco under his lip and like a shark that knows it could die if it stops moving doesnt through the entire
scene suzanne get shapiro on the phone
are you thinking rincon
yeah hes lost faith for the season
i think hes gonna dump him
they wait as suzanne dials the indians gm staring at the speakerphone that sits like a little island in the middle of the conference table
shapiro on two
lets be honest
a premiere setup man is not going to get you any closer to the playoffs
are you referring to rincon
hes a luxury you cant afford
and you can
theres half a million on his contract and at least one other suitor
by at least one you mean one
who is it
id rather not say
ill call you back
he hangs up
stares down peter
what do you think we can get for magnante
continues to stare whats left on venafros contract
two seventy five
suzanne get me sabean
if we can get san francisco interested in venafro shapiros only got one buyer for rincon
pete gets busy on his computer
you like venafro
i can let you have him for almost nothing
smelling a rat why would you do that billy
because im amazing
all i want is a couple of bucks and a sweetener
throw in say
billy snaps his fingers at peter anderson
i like anderson
no you dont
i dont even like him
i dont know why im doing this but lets do it anyway
venafro for michaelson
see i dont even know his name
ill think about think about it and call me back
he hangs up
get shapiro back on
billy and pete stare at each other in silence
you cant afford him billy
you sure about that
i get the impression the market for rincon is softening
i could be wrong
call whoevers interested and make sure theyre still interested
and call me back
he hangs up
what about the mets for venafro
you just offered him to the giants
suzanne steve phillips
get me steve phillips
pete works his computer
between bonds nen kent and snow theyre never gonna do it
we just need them to cool on rincon
phillips on two
i hear youre looking for a left handed reliever
what do you think of venafro
i can make it quick and easy for you
whats the angle
who am i getting fleeced for
hang on a second
he puts him on hold
peter is already scrolling through the mets farm system his eyes darting around the stats
twenty six and in double a
eckerton thats the guy
billy punches the phone off hold
i like eckerton
you dont even know who eckerton is
the phone on petes desk rings
peter answers a second blinking line
is venafro hurt
no hes not hurt
this is just a situation for us
last couple of times out he got hammered
im on with steve
not his fault
we misused him
tell him to hold
to steve phillips look
heres the deal
im being straight with you
im getting rincon
its a done deal
i heard the giants no the giants want venafro
and i told them they can have him for michaelson
but id rather deal with you
because you can give me eckerton and two hundred and twenty five thousand cash and the giants cant
billys look to peter says doesnt hurt to ask
as they listen to silence on phillips side of the call yes i understand its impolite to keep you holding
ill think about it
but whoever calls me back first gets venafro
he hangs up
looks for the blinking light that belongs to his owner
he hung up
then if you could have the power of flight or invisibility which would you choose
invisibility or flight
thats what casey said
youd have total access
besides everyone else would choose flight
why isnt anybody calling
the phone rings
shapiros on two
billy picks up
lemme talk to my owner
call you right back
phillips or schott
why would i call phillips back
tell him im on the other line
billy cant sit
schott its peter brand
sorry i left you on hold
billy asked me to call you back
hes on another line
tell him we need two hundred and twenty five grand for rincon
billy says he needs two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars for ricardo rincon
yes i added the please
listens to billy no
billy thinks intensely
finally tell him ill pay it but when i sell him next year for twice that i keep the money
billy says hell pay for rincon himself sell him next year and keep the profit
peter listens to whatever steve schott is saying then okay
he says hell pay for rincon
what are we forgetting
get me shapiro
as he grabs his cell phone and hits speed dial
wait never mind
beat then into mark
yeah its billy
heres the deal
i dont want rincon pitching against me tonight
tell him to change his clothes
i got you the money and i accept your gratitude
he hangs up
we gotta let someone go
its gotta be mags
i call not it
billy dials an extension
the good news is ricardo rincons heading over to the clubhouse
the bad news is you got to tell mags he threw his last pitch for the oakland as last night
what do you mean no
no as in no
im not doing it
you do it
you did it so you do it
art hangs up
billy slams the speakerphone
its not the phones fault
suzanne were gonna need a new speakerphone
we gotta catch mags before rincon comes over
billy comes through the clubhouse past his team suiting up to where magnante is adjusting his knee braces next to his locker and sits with him
i know ive been struggling lately
but were coming into the home stretch and i promise im gonna turn it i need you to stop getting dressed
magnante isnt sure he heard right but the silence tells him he did
billy shakes his head no
im sorry for the crap news
i know it hurts
i cant have guys in the clubhouse
billy gets up to leave
as he exits he sees peter enter with rincon standing with his new uniform in his arms looking like a prison inmate
billy joins them
hey i know this must seem a bit sudden but the oakland as have been trying to get you for a long time
youre gonna love it here
the guys are fun
i pitch tonight
i dont know if youre gonna pitch tonight
but youre on our team tonight
i no wanna pitch tonight
where you from
well youre a lot closer to home
why dont you hang out there for five menudos and well get you a uniform and everything
to side room hey guys clear the room huh
say hi to ricardo rincon
as the other players file out and say hello
billy tara and casey at dinner
tara and me were thinking dad
tara and i she is correct
tara and i were thinking about going to point reyes to the beach
thatd be fun
me go too
and ill work on my grammar
beat then dad
are you going to lose your job
where did you hear that honey
no im not going to lose my job
dont go on the internet or watch tv or read the papers or talk to people
im not talking to people im just reading stuff
you dont believe me
hes not losing his job
your dad is a brilliant man
hes the best gm in baseball
but say that you did just saying would you have to move away
and even if i did im not going anywhere
i told you not to worry about me
people say a lot of crazy things and they dont always know what theyre talking about
its just gossip
like gossipers at school
you cant always believe what you read
sometimes you need to scratch underneath the surface and find who the authority is
and once you do find out who the authorities are ignore them at all costs
you can always ask your dad
everythings fine honey
im not going anywhere
the only way i would lose my job is if someone was to give me a better one
dont worry about me okay
dad knows what hes doing
of the al west standings over a game being played from the start of the season until now the teams shifting positions as the games out and winning percentage numbers
change like an adding machine too fast for us to really follow but then the calculations abruptly lock and were given enough time to understand where we and oakland are after al west gb wp seattle
the as begin this road trip on a game winning streak picking up two games on the mariners and the angels and it should be noted this is their longest
winning streak in six years heading into a pitch tracking camera mounted in center field
zoom in to the lens
peter sits with hatteberg reviewing his hits on a monitor
this is a chart of what you should and shouldnt be swinging at
these circles represent different pitches
red is hit blue is out yellows missed or foul green is chased white taken
this is you versus conway
what do you see
im chasing a lot of high and outside
the red is where most hits happen
thats where you want to be swinging
you dont want to be swinging at the junk at the top of the strike zone
wed rather take those strikes cause youre not going to hit em out of the park
and youre good about that patient
right now youre averaging about pitches per at bat
yeah and thats great
one of the reasons why we love you
youre draining a pitchers pitches
now guys like bonds and jason giambi average a little over
thats top tier
does this chart make sense to you
ill get on base more if i lay off anything high
this is awesome
so you have a breakdown of this from every game
your instincts are in the right place
this isnt something they teach you in little league
this is something fundamental were looking for how to wear out a pitchers arm
if youre about to face conway and wondering what you should and shouldnt swing at come in here and watch how youre tending
you can click on any one of these pitches and watch it happen
pretty great right
show me some of the stuff im chasing up high
time lapse of hundreds of at bats registering and changing modalities to produce graphs and numbers
pull out to reveal were now in peter and bradford review footage
peter analyzes the data with billy as they throw a ball back and forth
everybody thinks the first pitch is whats most important but its not
its the first two out of three pitches that matter the most
the difference between and is the difference between a scrub and an all star
so youre saying if we can get our guys to lay off the first pitch itll put us in the drivers seat
any sort of extra discipline in the first three pitches will help us
a game is on tv in the background
billy makes various comments the the screen thats a problem right there
terrance jogging to first
thats what we pay you for
chad bradford you deceptive son of a bitch i love you
hes a pain in the ass but that giambi gets on base
another train of thought hatteberg once had walks in at bats
my whole career i only had eighteen walks
and now we have quick scenes of billy taking players migs lets make a deal
ill pay you fifty bucks for every away fastball you hit to opposite field but youve gotta pay me fifty for every one of those you pull
tejada immediately starts thinking about it
terrance long is working out
billy pokes his head in
did your car get egged
i think i just got an e mail from the culprit
he said he was tired of paying good money just to watch you jogging around the bases
what the hell does that have to do with anything
i dont know man
dont worry about it
long calls after who brings eggs to the ballpark anyway
billy and mecir walk down the hall with the smelly stain
man youre not fooling anyone but yourself out there
youre falling further and further behind
in your mind whats the problem
mecir mumbles something
i cant understand you with your hand over your mouth
its just the smell
and its growing
they stare at the stain in silence
im gonna grab a shower
hatteberg in the clubhouse
whats on your mind
i feel like im hurting the team
at first base im making a lot of errors
im gonna cost us a hundred runs
but as a hitter you will create runs
runs wins us an awful lot of ball games
i can live with that
can you live with that
i appreciate that but i know youre just pulling those numbers out of your ass
im pulling them out of petes actually
and another thing
when a guy reaches first base be social
like a greeter at the gap
a guy steps into your office chat him up
youre well read you went to college
have some fun out there
scottie you deserve to be here
peter is erasing the percentage of games left that they need to win and writing in a lower number
time lapse photography of all of the changes to the board over the following two weeks

the standings graphic shows the as have just moved up into a three way tie for first place
oaklands offense has exploded scoring runs in their last four games and extending their streak to in a row which is an american league record going back to and just
three shy of the al west gb wp oakland
chad bradford smokes the last batter on a called third strike to end the game against the twins and the team rushes in to congratulate him billy looks down at
his blackberry sees the result and makes a small fist pump
who would have thought in april id be saying this the as won their th game in a row thats two shy of tying three shy of beating the american
league record where the energy is electric
al west gb wp oakland
this is something special now and far be it for me to jinx it by saying how many consecutive games the as have won

tickets are torn and purses searched as record breaking numbers of fans pour into the stadium
none of the oakland fans in their cars down there have forgotten the as inglorious history making choke in game of the alds last october and tonight its like a
the players are getting ready without music or chat
justice steps up to deliver a pre game pep talk

september kansas city royals at oakland as one game shy of consecutive wins they have a shot at redemption
how rare is it to win games in a row
this rare no american league team has ever done it
billy heads east on
his cell phone rings and he hits the speaker button for the truck
dont tell me the score peter
its me billy
how you doin leggy
you hangin in there
go into real estate
what a stupid thing to say
billy didnt even realize until that moment how much he wanted to hear her say that
hes not sure what to say back
i appreciate that thanks
casey wants to talk to you
are you on your way to the stadium
no im on my way to visalia to see our minor league team
dad turn around
you have to see the game
no i dont
ill talk to you later sweetheart
i love you
he hangs up drives a little longer
letting what casey said sink in
he turns on the radio
tim hudson is carving through this royals line up and at the end of three its the as and kansas city nothing
billy sees the sign for the next exit coming up
he makes a decision and quickly crosses to the right just making the exit
billy is striding through an underground corridor which is echoing with the cheers of fans
billy emerges from a tunnel to a sight billys denied himself for games the lit up ballpark with a game in play
from the field we see billy finding his place in the seats behind home plate
peter is already there
billys pov of the scoreboard at the bottom of the rd
unfortunately the idyllic moment is short lived as dye strikes out swinging and the teams swap places
the as take the field with tim hudson pitching
billy looks around
he sees the scoreboard a fan with a big funky cowboy hat the charged up crowd in the stands its like the coliseum at rome
ibanez of the royals singles to center field
randa of the royals singles to left field
but the oakland fans are still jubilant and do the wave
then a big error from tejada puts runners on st nd and rd mayne ibanez and randa
as if weve entered the twilight zone it becomes twilight and lights go on
dee brown of the royals singles to right bringing ibanez and randa home and mayne to rd
ibanez and randa high five each other at the plate passing billy as they head to their dugout
okay the royals are on the board now but just barely
until perez of the royals singles to center field bringing mayne home
then tucker of the royals doubles to left field
justice makes an embarrassing fall trying to catch it and brown and perez score
they high five and pass billy as they leave the plate the second time hes seen that and suddenly the royals have
reaction shot close ups justice tejada tucker on nd art howe the royals dugout a pitchers conference with peterson and hudson
and finally billy who walks out
mike sweeney of the royals singles to left center field neither justice or long get it it lands between them
and they have words
randa makes a sloppy single to left field
this one goes between justice and tejada
montage of as at bat hernandez grounds out durham strikes out mabry grounds out
a stunned as fan stands up with his arms out in a wtf
while the as are still up this is excruciating for the fans
kansas citys scored five and oaklands lead is down to six as art howe comes out to the mound to pull tim hudson
art howe comes out of the dugout gives the signal for underhander takes the ball from hudson
hell go with the submariner chad bradford
we see shots of fans in the sold out stadium experiencing the height of tension and excitement in sports
chad bradford comes off the bullpen mound to relieve hudson and begins counting his steps one two three four chad arriving at the mound taking the game ball from art
who we see is genuinely supportive and encouraging to chad
chad finishing his warm up pitches
i know what it is to be in need and to have plenty
i am content
i can do all things through christ who gives me billy is just as tense as the fans
to himself but to okay chad lets see it
chad walks mayne
an angry fan throws toilet paper onto center field the one thing long manages to pick up
the crowd grows anxious
chads submariner pitch to the next batter dee brown walks him
brown trots down to first and there are now two runners on
some fans have to cover their eyes
theres a pitcher conference
art howe simmers in frustration
he signals rincon to warm up
the fans arent happy either
ordaz of the royals grounds to tejada who throws home for the force and misses
howe pulls bradford
rincon throws a controversial strike out
the royals batter tucker protests and fans go crazy booing
brown scores now royals chipping away that lead howe pulls rincon
tam comes in to relieve him
in rapid succession we seem him battle off ten pitches of tam
hes got two strikes on him more toilet paper flies on the field bowie comes in to warm up which tam sees then sweeney hits a three run homer to
this is excruciating
bowie is already gone
koch is on the mound
theres a royal pellow on nd
according to the scoreboard its outs strikes
if koch throws a strike the game is over
the fans are fucking feverish
alicea of the royals singles to left and pellow scores
the game is now tied
in their dugout royals gloat
hes ended the inning but in the as dugout koch slams the wall
the scoreboard shows us that its still tied in the bottom of the ninth
dye grabs a bat and walks to the plate
then inexplicably howe turns to hattie
grab a bat
scott hatteberg actually points to himself and mouths me
scott pulls a bat from the rack and heads to the on deck circle
he only manages a warmup pitch or two before billy is watching on a muted television as he sees dye fly out to right field
as hatte approaches the plate he kills the tv
as roy steeles booming voice echoes pinch hitting for eric byrnes scott hatteberg
scotts wife elizabeth watches from the vip seats
she clutches her face
scott lets the first pitch go by
art howe looks like he cant stand it any longer
in the dugout koch looks like a psychopath ready to kill
scott steps out of the box to catch his breath
he steps back in and stares at the exact spot in space he thinks the pitch will leave the pitchers hand
the as leap to the front of the dugout steps and watch
we see the ball ascending on a strong trajectory but before we can know for sure where its headed time slows billys sitting on the floor with his back against
the wall trying to breathe
he looks like hes in pain
he cant move
he hears the crowd erupt outside
his blackberry buzzes hatte homered
as ryls billy flips on the tv
with sound off he watches silent images of his team swarming the mound in archival footage mixed in with art howe celebrating with them
the place is going crazy
elizabeth is screaming as she watches her husband get mauled by his teammates at the plate
billys still contemplating making al history as celebrating players flood into the locker room just outside
billy looks through a portal on the door
hes trapped in here now
he crosses into the the place is packed with players coaches and news crews
theres no champagne spraying but they feel like they won the world series and in fact have done something much more rare
billy is trying to make a fast unnoticed exit
after pushing through the crowd he walks outside of the club house into the where the players families and wives are waiting
billy sees elizabeth hatteberg walking toward him
im elizabeth hatteberg
we met at my house last christmas
whatever you put in those christmas cookies keep elizabeth starts to cry whoa
you dont know what its like to have everyone think youre a failure
billy doesnt say anything but of course he does
you never thought that and thats the worst possible i did
and he knows i did
billy takes this in a second
yeah he does know you did
hes talked to you
i just know
thats all over now
your husband just took a jason grimsley two seam fastball and parked it in the upper deck in left field for a pinch hit walk off home run in a
record breaking game
go tell him about it
elizabeth looks at him a moment
and then starts crying no its okay now just go
elizabeth goes off to find her husband
billy sees peter standing there
billy and tara are eating
i spend the season trying to reduce it to numbers and we won on romance
suddenly its the natural with hatteberg
you shouldve seen elizabeths face when it went right over
she showed up afterwards
what did she say
i was a big moment for them
you know everyone wrote him off
you found him and you put that together
it was beautiful
but you know
its not gonna mean a thing
she knows it
heres the thing we changed the game
we got this year maybe next then theyre gonna catch on
this is our moment
i want to go the distance
i wanna shove it up the yankees ass
not just the yankees but
these guys deserve it
you deserve it
its a record
thats right its just a record
it gets buried in some book
come on tell me who won
i dont even know
its th place at the olympics
any other team wins the world series this year
were still in the record books
but if we win weve changed the game
weve put it on its head and shoved it up their ass
if we dont theyre gonna erase us
the same shot as at the beginning the coliseum from high above only this time the final game of the division series is being played at home
minnesota twins at oakland as the camera pans down the huge scoreboard
the numbers on the board tell us its been an incredibly close game but the as are losing by one run in the bottom of the ninth with two outs
and nobody on
ray durham stands in at the plate
strike one to the durham as we hear the venerable voice of espns joe morgan whos speaking post game
the flaw in the as thinking and this comes from the top of their organization is their failure to comprehend you have to manufacture runs in the post season
durham fouls off a pitch
you have to steal
you have to bunt
you have to sacrifice
you have to trust in small ball not billy ball
durham swings at the fastball and connects but its a pop fly to second which a twins infielder easily nabs
the pitcher throws his glove in the air and the catcher runs out to the mound as the rest of the twins run to the middle of the field to
begin their victory celebration
durham turns away and heads back to the dugout
the as have lost the series
they think theyve devised a science to win games
they think it resides in a computer
they thumb their nose at fundamentals
harrowed by the defeat peter stares at the tv listening to joe morgan
theyre bean counters in oakland
thats bean with an e at the end
theyre card counters at the blackjack table who forget the house always wins
peter smashing a wooden chair to pieces with a baseball bat
peter in exhaustion his eyes glued again to the screen watching shots archival video of euphoric twins reveling and as stunned at their misfortune
a locked off shot begins to slowly move towards the pile of celebrating players on the mound and as we near the sound begins to fade and the players begin
to disappear as do the fans and all occupants of the coliseum
drift in an empty stadium towards the dugout where the last of the cleaning crew brooms the floor
camera moves down a dimly lit cinder block corridor and finally into the where we discover a solitary figure
the camera comes to settle on the oakland as player still in uniform hours after the game has ended sitting with his face in his hands
after a long deep breath he sits up and we discover that its billy years prior
billy still in uniform walks down the long corridor that leads to the gms office his cleats clicking on the concrete halls
this is weird billy
billys standing in front of the as gm wearing his uniform pants and a t shirt
its like a politician quitting a campaign to become a staffer
do you even know what a scout does
ive been scouted since i was
and youre ready to say im not a baseball player
im not a baseball player
ready to do this
billy calls out suzanne
get schott on
you ever been to boston
the speakerphone rings
we need to talk about the red sox
so i heard
john henry reached out to you
but i havent spoken with him yet
thats what he said
i want your blessing before i do
well how am i supposed to react to all of this
youre under contract billy
i know that steve but id like to talk to them
i want to see what they have to say
youre asking me to let them talk to you
with your permission
well i cant do that unless i know peter is in place as my gm
im not letting you take him with you and i have no idea if hes willing to stay if you arent here
how do i even know i can come to terms with him given the extremely disadvantaged bargaining position youre putting me in
well i think youll agree this is a great opportunity for him
i cant believe hes not going to make a deal
peter is frozen
neither steve nor billy are acting like hes even in the room
if you want out of your contract i want their whole team and a lot of cash
weve invested in you
i havent asked to get out of my contract steve i just asked if i could talk to them
and i said i wont give you permission unless i know i have peter
you cant leave me with a vacant front office
then talk to peter
you know what
ive made it a point never to stand in the way of a man wanting to make more money
they made the call the genies out of the bottle
i had faith in your judgement when i named you gm thats why i did it and i have faith in it now
good luck billy
billy hangs up
a long beat
peter looks at billy
well i didnt see that coming
i think you should think about staying
youre one of the architects of this thing it belongs as much to you as it does to me
how you doing pete
im a little overwhelmed right now
i think i need to process whats happening
why dont you take the day off
billy regards culinary treats presented fancifully in a towncar that transports him to fenway park
we establish the famous home of the red sox before finding billy standing on home plate
he looks around at the historic stadium
john henry the new owner of the boston red sox is shouting at him from the owners box
billy gives a kind of wave
due respect to the coliseum but this is a ball park
yes it is
you ever play here
billy swinging hard at a pitch in the dirt
thats a shame
lets walk the field
billy and john begin a stroll around the perimeter of fenway
hey im sorry i kept you waiting but believe it or not there was snow on
the second week in october
the car turns on to yawkee way and its degrees and this
how can there be an entirely different weather system here than there is three miles from here
is that global warming or a sign that theres no such thing
i dont know
whats that billy joel song
oh the snow it was falling from stockbridge to boston
and the hilltops seemed something because of that frosting
i think thats james taylor and im certain those arent the words
well whatever it was snowing from stockbridge to boston so im sorry im late
well have lunch in a little bit but why dont i have some coffee sent up
hes already got his cell phone open denise
back to billy weve got espresso cappuccino latte weve got a machine that makes whatever you want
weve got free soda
i heard about that
can you have some coffee in there for us
he snaps the phone shut
billy and john admire the view
denise sets down a tray of coffee and exits
its her birthday and i need to get her a present but shes usually the one who does that for me so do you have any ideas
you mean like wool
no i meant something that women wear with you know a decorative sure
and where would i get something like that
john no disrespect i just lost in five for the second year in a row give her a bowling ball for all i care
steve schott told me hes offering you a new contract
yes he is
so whyd you return my call
youre the red sox and i think i can help you
i think i can do something about the curse of the bambino
i heard you hired bill james
why it took someone so long to hire that guy is beyond me
because baseball hates him
money buys a lot of things
one is the luxury to disregard what baseball thinks
that must be nice
beat then i was grateful to get your call
john looks at billy a moment
you were grateful
for million you built a playoff team
you lost damon giambi isringhausen and pena and you won two more games without them than you did with them
and we begin a slow push in on billy
this is the first person in baseball other than his assistant who doesnt think hes crazy
you won the exact same number of games as the yankees but the yankees paid
million dollars per win and you paid two hundred and sixty thousand
yes i want you to be my general manager
i know youre taking it in the teeth
the first guy through a wall always gets hurt
but those are dying voices
any gm that doesnt tear down their team and rebuild it using your model is gonna be a dinosaur
johns taken a piece of paper out of his pocket and slides it to billy
my first offer
billy opens it looks at it for less than a second and looks back up at john
billy looks out at the boston scenery
he steals a glance at the paper in his hand johns offer pensive
billy comes into the locker room and gives it a look
billy sits at a table
a baseball slams down in front of him
he looks up to see where it came from
peter is standing in the doorway
what the hell sorry
what the hell was that
i dont know
how was boston
youre giving me youkilis billy
why would i ever do that
come on billy schotts going to want something in exchange for letting you out of your contract and i want youkilis
oh what is that your gm voice
you cant have him
and a player to be named later
you already have my job
what else do you want from me
i dont want your job
why did you take it
you didnt leave me much choice
did henry make you a good offer
it doesnt matter
did he make you a good offer
it was fine
what was it
it doesnt matter
pete just stares at him
finally billy reaches into his pocket takes out the folded piece of paper and hands it to peter
peter looks at it
he offered to make you the highest paid gm in pro sports
do i love the red sox
i dont know
ive never heard you say you did
so why am i doing this
youre not doing it for the money
youre doing it for what the money says
it says what it says to any player who gets big money that theyre worth it
the offer says that
the money itself is redundant
i made one personal decision based on money in my life and i swore to never do that again
so youre not going to boston
i havent decided
its all over the news that its a done deal
look at this place
what a dump
i so wanted to win here
i think youve already won billy
no pete we lost
you havent given yourself time to get over it its only been three days
im not even over last year yet
i dont get over it
ive got something in the video room come with me
i really cant look at video right now
no come with me
its not much more than a home movie but youll get the idea
who is it
the visalia oaks and their pound catcher jeremy brown whos scared of running to second
this was in a game six weeks ago
paul hits the remote and the tape starts
the quality is poor and the camera is focused only on jeremy
this guys gonna start him off with a fastball low and in because he hasnt read the book on our guy and doesnt know that low and in is where
jeremy takes him to deep center we see jeremy brown connect and the ball fly off the bat but the camera stays on jeremy running to first
paul slows down the picture with the remote and he knows that if he runs its a stand up double and hes running
and now hes gonna do something he never does
hes gonna round first base hes gonna take the turn
please tell me hes safe at second
because right here jeremy slips and stumbles to the ground
is what hes always been afraid of
its all he can do to get himself back to first
jeremy has been scrambling in the dirt to get safely back to first base
what is that
thats the first base coach
whys he laughing
im gonna fire that guy why the hell is he everybodys laughing
jeremys looking around the field now looking at his own dugout
we cant see what he sees but hes confused
and now jeremy finds out why
watch his face because this is art
hes just found out the ball went feet over the fence
hed hit a home run but he didnt know it
and jeremys face explodes into a smile
he slaps hands with the first base coach and begins his trot around the bases
billy stares at this
he takes the remote and backs it up a little so he can see jeremys face again
how can anybody not be romantic about baseball
it was a metaph i know it was a metaphor
that was a hell of a baseball season boss
the island of misfit toys
and with that billys mind begins to go elsewhere
no resolution no decision other than to get up and wander on
billy stops in front of a door checks to see if its open it is and he enters
billy stands and takes it in
billy stands and takes it in
billy stands at area from which a mysterious smell still emanates
billy haunts the field talking to himself
eventually he stands at the plate and has an imaginary at bat
pete watches billy from the pitch tracking monitor as he argues with an imaginary ump before hitting an imaginary inside the park home run that ends with a slide into
billy wanders over to the pitchers mound
his pov of perfect sky
billys driving along and listening to the continued drone of talk radio criticism
billy keeps listening a moment then reaches in the glove box and pulls out a cd marked dads mix
billy slips it in the cd player
the sound of the radio immediately snaps off and the momentary silence is soon broken by caseys voice hey dad
i picked these songs out just for you
and then the first track on the cd comes on song tbd
and billy smiles
he continues on down the freeway into dusk as david justice at the plate
