city of joy written by october early draft heat that has mass
that rises off the parched earth in shimmering waves
after a moment we see what appear to be figures coming out of the haze one by one
a family with their few belongings hasari pal his wife aloka and their children daughter amrita sons manooj and shambu and hasaris mother and father
they embark toward the night the rising sun behind them
hasaris father passes a gourd of precious water
hasari serves the children first
shambu gulps entirely too much the others forcing him to stop by a unified force of will
embarrassed he passes the cup to his brother who sips as does his sister
aloka barely wets her lips insisting on leaving the last drops for hasari
and now a rooster tail of dust rises up behind the approaching bus and the old parents bid farewell to their sons family
there is an intense sadness at leaving the land and hasaris mother clings to him
ill send money soon
his mother nods as hasari erupts in a small cough which by habit he suppresses
his mother crushes aloka to her
dont let the children out of your sight
not for a moment
now the children
she wants to keep them here even as the old man touches her reminding her she must let them go
help your parents
dont fight with each other
and manooj stay away from the cinema do you hear
shambu his eyes big as saucers whispers to his grandma
i dont want to go
there are bad men with long knives who steal children
that does it hasaris mother dissolves in tears but the old man nevertheless unlooses her insistently from the children
aloka and the children get on the bus as the old man embraces his son
a mans journey to the end of his obligations is a very long road
yours begins here
theres not an empty inch inside the little vehicle or on top
the passengers are silent
a woman breast feeds a baby
several passengers fan themselves
the pals squeeze wearily into the rear seat
to his neighbor our farm has died so we are moving to calcutta to become rich
hasari and aloka look at each other if only it were the pursuit of wealth and not survival
the woman under stands
and now the bus grinds forward and the pals look back
hasari coughs suppresses it
as silence falls
the elder pals stand huddled together in the dust and we see nestled behind a boulder at the roadside a tiny blue flower beautiful and fragile but like all things
alive determined to live
and we hear the sound of a dozen voices chanting a quiet mantra in unison as we this flower floats gently in a bowl of water
the titles end as we pull back slowly to reveal a dozen anglos several indians and one kenyan seated cross legged before an aging yogi whos quietly urging the suppli
cants to find their light allow your white light to fill your spirits eye
above ceiling fans move the air
as we pan the group we see that everyone has his her eyes closed in earnest meditation
until we come to an american max loeb who pops open first his right eye looks to his right and left closes his right eye and opens his left eye
looks left and right
and then instead of continuing the mantra and the search for his white light expels a stream of air through his pursed lips making a vibrating flatulent sound one indicative
of sizeable frustration and dismissal
around him other single eyes pop open searching for the source of this unmeditative sound
max nods and smiles a wry smile as if to say this just aint doin it for me folks
max closes the trumpet case and starts chucking his clothes and books in a knapsack and a small valise
we notice the hebrew letter chai on a gold chain around his neck
his girl friend betsy kahn overdressed somewhat in an indian style endeavors to exercise the inner peace shes been pursuing
i swear to god you never give anything enough time
what did you expect in five days max
only what they promise in the brochure inner peace serenity and a nice chant that gets rid of this rock in my gut
they do you in a weekend
i would really appreciate it if you wouldnt be terribly glib just now max
thats okay with max whos willing to eschew communica tion of all kinds and just finish heaving his stuff in the valise
am i to assume youll be at the airport in calcutta a week from tomorrow
impossible to predict betsy ilene kahn
maybe you better give me my ticket
screw you max i paid for it
how many times am i going to let you walk out on me and come back
i think only you can answer that betsy ilene kahn
she slaps him
do you really think thats an appropriate way to get rid of your western rage bets
she swings at him again
he catches her hand hard in his fist
one slap is romantic
two would call for retaliation
lend me a hundred dollars
she yanks free begins to chant her mantra as he grabs his knapsack and valise and goes out the door
now shes silent and in the simplest sense deeply hurt
she cant help herself she cares
we stay with her a moment as we cool lush hills
a little pack of single engine two and four seaters
max in shorts and university of miami t shirt hot sweaty appears around a bend in the approach road
a small service desk
a clerk who doubles as ground control on the microphone passing on the prevailing wind and the active runway
we hear the static backed voice of a pilot giving his call numbers then announcing hes clear for immediate takeoff on the active runway
the clerk clicks off and finds max
how you doin
the clerk gives max a warm smile
ive always wanted to walk into a little airport just about like this one and ask the guy at the counter the following question
the clerk nods hes at maxs ervice
whens the next flight to anywhere
tomorrow at one oclock in the afternoon
a beat the clerk with his smile max with his one simply warm the other giving off simmering heat
max sits on the ground up against the building playing a jazz line quietly and rather well on his trumpet
a pair of well shod feet enter the frame
max looks up
the rubicund face of veejay chattergee and more british than churchill
behind him his cherubic wife ravi
and making her way toward the enclave of small planes their daughter manubai
i say are you looking for a way out of here
we have an extra seat
where are you wanting to go
maxs eyes flick from veejay to the back view of manubai as she continues on and back to veejay
im wanting to go wherever youre wanting to take me
max is crammed into the back seat with the plump ravi
we see now that contrary to our assumption that veejay would be in the left seat its manubai whos flying the plane
the noise of the engine forces them to speak somewhat loudly
we were among the fortunate back in
we got out of east bengal before partition destroyed so many
we make mattresses
the rajah double spring
veejay has an old flask out
we dont have a flight attendant on this flight
passing the flask are you a musician mr
unattached trumpet player and recently certified associate guru
as he takes a hit on the flask maxs eye focuses on the little mirror on the dash
in it he can see manubais eyes
if we were to judge by what he sees in them she doesnt find him the least bit amusing
he smiles his smile at her
a huge bridge dominates the skyline
the train trundles to a stop its whistle clearing the way
people hang on its sides sit on the roof
and now flood the platform flowing into the station clearing a view for us of the pals clinging to their baggage in the middle of this human anthill
hands reach out with sweets to sell with tea asking for money
daddy im scared
this is very exciting
as soon as we get to our friends house everything will be fine
but despite hasaris charade of confidence they and we are overwhelmed by the size of the station and the desperate energy of the humanity around them
as they press on a small beggar woman huddled on the platform turns her eyes eerily on manooj
as a deformed hand stretches into the frame
aloka senses someone a beggar face half hidden and eaten away by leprosy
this terrifying image presses the boys tightly to their mother and moves hasari to encircle armita with one hand and attempt to wrap the other three inside the embrace of
his other hand
it does not seem possible that he can protect all of them against the predatory eyes watching them
he moves them quickly to a wall
wait right here
he moves to a line of vendors shows a piece of paper to one as he digs out his precious screw of money to make a purchase of sweets from
please can you direct me to my friend at this address
we are to stay with him
the vendor gives the address a look shows it to the vendor next to him
both look at hasari
theres no such address as this in calcutta
but thats not possible
of course it is possible
i have lived here all my life
you are new
who would know if a place exists or does not
dear god what now
stunned hasari hands vendor a rupee and with the sweets turns back to his family his face going through a magical transformation as he prepares to suggest to the family
that all is well
a few clean and cared for ambassador cars sweep into the gateway of the grand hotel past a gateman
feet tramping the pulsating tarmac sending up dust
the pals scared dispirited weary consumed by the crowd
theyve been walking a long time
shambu cries aloka tries to ease his fear
they stop numbly at the edge of the park put their bundles down against a long wall
across the way a thin policeman shares a cigarette with a group of traders
there is a deeply fearful look in hasaris eyes a look he is having difficulty controlling now
he needs to revive the familys confidence
he takes out his precious bundle of rupees and gives one to manooj
manooj though is fixed on the cinema across the street
hasari indicates a stall just across the main road
manooj go and get some fruit
come straight back
delighted with his task manooj sets off his eyes on the marquee of the theater with its huge cardboard cutout of kumar kapur starring in hot gun
hasari calls out to him to watch where hes going the mere crossing of the street is a potential parental nightmare
a hand ruffles manoojs head and a tall man with dark eyes and a sweet smile comes at the boys anxious parents
yes hello brother
bihar am i correct
yes how did you know
hasari is torn between speaking to the man and watching his sons incredible journey across the street
let me say only that the terrible malevolence that has visited your part of the country affects us all
three years without rain
nothing came out of the earth but debts
and now the family on the street
it is not acceptable
smile widens and if i cant help my name is not mr
which blessedly it is
and now a smile as full as the sky above
a brick slides out of the wall
were behind the brick and see gangoolys soft face as he reaches in and pulls out a key
the street is small and empty
though the houses are nothing much to the pals they look like palaces
manooj and shambu run about in delight
gangooly motions for quiet
with a flourish he opens the door
gangooly enters glances around waves the pals in
theres a cage occupied by two parrots
in one corner a small altar dedicated to the goddess lakshmi is decorated with some flowers and behind a torn plastic curtain in a corner part kitchen part wash place
containing a tap with running water
be free look around
on the faces of the family is one thought is it possible
amrita goes right to the parrots
theyll need feeding
give them seed
but dont spoil them
he bows briefly before the altar as he moves to the washing area
and now one of the miracles of life in the city
one and two
he turns on the tap and a stream of brown water gurgles out
the pals are hypnotized the fists around their hearts begin to ease
holy water from the ganges
flows out forever
come touch it
manooj and shambu put their hands under the tap
its as pure as the dew on shivas lips
gangooly claps in delight
and beckons hasari aside
now this place is yours for two weeks
my cousin moti is away traveling
normally the rent takes fifty rupees for a week but for a brother forty
no dont thank me
hasari pulls out his little screw of money
i have only seventy five but as soon as i have work
give me the fifty pay the rest next week
youll find work i trust you
arent i from bihar too
and the money is in his hand
he joins his hands together
you are pleased
gangooly is pleased
its how i am
he turns on his heel and hes gone
for a moment the pals are still swept from the brink of catastrophe to salvation
and now as one they release their sheer and utter joy
ravi and veejay leading max up the grand staircase manubai in the foyer looking after them
ravi leads the way into a lovely guest bedroom
i hope this is all right
the room hasnt been aired or the bed turned but oh he doesnt care about that do you max
here look here
veejay opens a little cupboard stocked with liquor
ravi come on go go lets leave the young man to himself
obediently ravi goes
max goes to the window
the beautiful manubai in the garden
he lies down on the bed
hes found nirvana
its hasari who watches now
theres laughter from aloka and amrita
joyful shouts from the boys
hasari is alone in the main room on his knees in front of the pile of their baggage and bundles
he turns his atten tion from the laughter to a just opened old suitcase
he takes out a small tea box
opens it delicately
its full of something brown
he pushes his fingers in and feels this bit of earth with a tenderness thats almost religious puts a pinch to his nose and breathes it in
the laughter and shouting from the bathing area is growing
shambu is paddling near the tap
aloka is bending over the drain and amrita is rinsing her heavy dark hair with a pot
manooj is nearby rubbing himself with an old towel
hasari enters unnoticed and looks at the group with tenderness
and with gratitude for their good fortune
a man red with anger yanks the curtain aside stares
the family freezes
alokas hair drips unnoticed on her sari
what are you doing here
who are you
my name is pal hasari
gangooly rented this space to mr
you must be his cousin mr
i dont know any gangooly and my name is binal and this is my home get out
the furious binal followed by the pals goes into the main part of the room
a small crowd has been attracted by the noise
but this is true
we paid him a deposit of fifty a man goes out because he has to work and some beggar tries to move in while his back is turned
this while binal has begun to throw things out onto the street though this cleansing of his home doesnt stop him from picking up a stick
the odd sympathizer meets with
so should i suffer if they are so stupid to jump into the first mouth that wants to eat them
he turns with the stick on hasari
youre lucky i dont kill you
hasari looks at manooj who drops his eyes
they collect the remainder of their possessions and hurry out the door
full of neighbors
theres a suppressed violence in the air
a man pushes aloka
sweat streaming down his face hasari confronts the man
a woman pushes the men apart
go to the river
try to squeeze in there
calcutta broiling buses vendors carts rickshaws children beg at car windows
the pals stand uncertain and for the first time a rickshaw fills hasaris eye carrying two passengers
but now he shoulders his burden and leads the family toward the river
we hold until they grow small against the setting sun gleaming red against the white domes of the victoria monument
moving through the dark a figure touching things looking at photographs of the chattergees
we hear a muffled dialogue mixed with the singing a la dean martin of everybody loves somebody sometime goddamn it boy whats the matter with you
everybody loves somebody sometime go for it son
sure dad whatever you say dad
everybody falls in love somehow youre the dad dad
now a humidor
max opens it takes out a cigar takes two
ravi in her bathrobe
he gives her his best saints smile
well you dont want to eat those awful cigars
come with me well wake up the cook shell fix you something proper
through the window we see the bleary eyed cook laying out food as ravi chatters away at max he with a beatific grin on his face as he feeds himself
the bridge etched against the dawn sky
the corpse of an indigent is collected and put on a cart
with his eyes open watching the dead man being removed
after their humiliating flight they found refuge here
tiny figures huddled together with their baggage and bundles near a tree not far from the steps that dip down to the smooth water
hasaris eyes too are on the dead man that warning
he kneels beside manooj strokes him
the boys eyes turns to the mans wondering if the man can provide for them
dont let it frighten you
you have to be brave
i know well find work today
fear and doubt fill manoojs eyes
hasari at the gates the family huddled together in the b
the man behind the gate shakes his head points
a line of a hundred men stretches from a door
hasari is on the edge of panic but when he turns to the family hes wearing his confident smile
as before he gathers the family into the protectorate of his arms and guides them onward
as he pushes off into the sea of humanity we pull back and up filling the frame with street upon street disappearing hasari
two plump men in shirt sleeves look coolly at hasari
the elder shakes his head
the younger shows hasari the door
outside an increasingly desperate hasari finds aloka before a small shrine saying a prayer
aloka huddled with manooj and amrita
hasari talking to the owner of a small market stall
shambu is peering into a shop with male mannequins in the window
in the moving mirror we see counters and shelves of mens clothing
the mirror stops at max slipping into a kurta before an audience of ravi manubai and a salesman
its not extravagant at all
you cant go around all week in your tribal garb
max sees a boys face pressed to the glass he indicates the shirt for the boys approval
the boy smiles a wonderful smile
now he looks civilized doesnt he manubai
max looks at her
she at him
man leans down whispers to the smiling boy
you sure i look all right
the little boy nods
max slips him several rupees
and he manubai and ravi fold themselves into her tiny car as shambu runs to his dejected family
a man gave me these many moneys
why did you ask him for money
he just gave it to me
where is he
shambu looks but the cars gone
dont do that
were not beggars
shambu is devastated
out of his own desperation hasari feels hes been a little rough on the boy
he holds him close
go back to the river
wait for me by the tree
dont go anywhere
do you understand
aloka the boys nod
we watch them as hasari heads off quickly becoming a small figure disappearing into the sea
starting to sink
we pan down to hasari stepping to a grilled window as the man ahead moves out
a flaking gray wall half obscured with moldering files
the grilled window lets in a little light and the quiet supplications of those outside
an old clerk at a desk
a voice calls out
the clerk looks up crosses to the grill
hasaris tense face through the bars
a truck rumbles past drowning out the words
the clerk shakes his head sadly
on the verge of panic hasari hangs onto the window
do you have family
yes yes of course
but im three days without work
ill take anything
the clerk digs in his pocket presses two rupees on hasari
here now go away
no i dont want you to give me the next man in line forcibly moves hasari out of the way
in this city a man with a family cant be proud
the clerk waves him away turns his attention to the next man
looking at each other
i said you have three days to get me into bed and im betting you cant do it
its all right for you to use my mother as your tour guide and meal ticket because shell get something nice out of it
but what would i get
he stares at her a moment then gets up goes around the table
well gee i dont know
maybe i could say something so amusing that youd laugh so hard it would break that hot poker you have up your ass
she stares at him
he bends to kiss her
she doesnt pull away
but after a moment he realizes she isnt responding
he continues the kiss but he opens his eyes
to find her staring at him
he pulls back
they stare at each other another moment then max senses someone in the doorway
staring at them disappointment filling her eyes
the same sound of frustration and ennui he made in the ashram
his arm around max veejay guides the young man toward a waiting taxi
believe me i understand but you know how women are
do you have enough money
max gives him a non commital shrug
veejay winks stuffs the money into maxs pocket
and then sneakered feet step over the sleep ing bovine who turns a disinterested eye up
max is guided by a grumpy hall porter wearing an off white shirt and bellbottoms through the walled and well planted courtyard of an inexpensive hotel
max gives the cow a bemused eye
the room is utterly utilitarian
the porter turns on a ceiling fan sending an army of cockroaches scurrying for calmer terrain
max clearly doesnt care for cockroaches
it pleases you
no fruit basket
no mini bar
max hands the porter several rupees
of course many many
but make care sahib
please for me
if it is lady you like to know yes
you let me
very sweet girl good nature very sweet
or boy very good
max puts a finger on the porters head turns him for the door
no like boy
something then for smoke mmmh very good for smoke
max eases the porter out
as the door is closing
maybe you like two girls look a little chinese but very great pleasure
max smiles his smile and disappears the porter behind the closed door
the smile disappears and the fan gets his attention it has an annoying rhythm and sound
he flicks the switch but the fan continues to snap around
he stares at it
and startles us by suddenly flicking out a hand and grabbing the blade stopping the fan
he lets go
the fan is still
he carries his knapsack to the tub it has brown stains along the middle and the water has a brown tinge as it flows out of the tap
he sits on the edge of the tub dumps his knapsack on the floor picks up a half dozen pamphlets from the ashram
guides to inner peace
he wings the pamphlets at the trashcan
hasari comes around the corner of a warehouse a smile on his face clutching some bananas and dried grain
his relief and ours is short lived
the space where he left the family has been cleared and taken over by trucks
hes lost his family
a group of hindus are celebrating a puja the women singing canticles at the top of their lungs the men tossing a little boy happily back and forth
as the panic stricken hasari rushes up
my wife my children
hasari rushes on
suddenly we his head turns and his eyes look this way that way
until out of the near silence we hear a distant extraordinary word
the word catches hasaris ear
he looks into the sea of people along the river bank under the bridge
as in a dream shambu rises up out of the sea of bodies and runs to his father
now aloka amrita manooj appear rising up out of the sea ending hasaris nightmare
a warrior returning from battle hasari engulfs the little boy
i told you to remain where i left you
i told you to stay there
the police came
we said we had to meet you but they didnt care
they were mean
as before hasari tries to engulf the rest of his family in the protectorate of his arms
in the b
arun and his family
these friends have found space
they will share with us
hasari looks at the tiny space
the roof is cardboard and cloth and half an old movie poster featuring the actor kumar kapur
hasari looks at his tiny bit of food debates a moment
then puts his hands together addresses these generous people
i would be proud if you would share our food with us
everyone looks at the food there is no disguising their hunger
distant transistor music as we pan down the pal children sleep despite the quiet moans and nightmare cries around them the two boys huddled together amrita close to her mother
hasari comes out of the dark
aloka looks at him
he shakes his head
he slumps beside her
aloka strokes hasari looking lovingly at him
i remember the first time i saw you on the day of our marriage
wearing a bright yellow turban
you asked me my name and you said you are a very beautiful girl and i am wondering whether you will find me appealing
he strokes her tenderly in return
but now overwhelmed with despair she begins to weep
she doesnt want to say it doesnt want to wake the children
its all right what
i miss the village
there i could help
hasari pulls aloka close strokes her
the sky turns red
the porter looks up shakes his head poor young man stuck with only a trumpet for company
max sits on the floor in a corner and plays as we hear the sound of a fierce whistle and a screaming engine
a gigantic earthmover lurches into position
awaken startled disoriented
aloka gentles the children as hasari moves instinctively toward the threat
a black ambassadorial car pulls up out of which steps a babu
a microphone and speaker has been set up
another car unloads several politicos with party banners
a minion hands the babu the mike he wants to get on with it before this turns into a political rally
hasari is close to him as is arun
the municipality has directed us to carry out the destruction of this settlement
all of you must go now
for a moment there is a babble of fear and frustration
then from hasaris side arun confronts the babu
for what reason
the babue appears disconcerted
hes not accustomed to the poor asking questions
because this settlement is impeding construction work
were not moving
why should we move
who is the municipality
this is our home
i have my orders
if were driven from here where should we go
ill give you five minutes to gather your things
then the settlement comes down
why should you alone be burdened with such a task
let me help
arun begins to tear his shelter apart and to heave the pieces at the babu who retreats
others soon take up the call to vent their frustration hurling things at the police and at the driver of the tractor
quickly weve got a full scale riot
the police wade into the crowd pounding people with their sticks arun one of the first to get hit
he staggers into hasaris arms
panic stricken hasari and aloka gather the children and their few belongings
as beside them a woman goes down from a stick to the head aloka stops instinctively to help the woman but hasari grabs her trying to shelter her and the
children as well as aruns wife and children clutching arun to him as in the chaos they manage to escape
on the billboard a maharajah sleeping snugly on a thick mattress
from his dreamland he inquires solicitously have you ever thought of a rajah double spring as a present
we pan down and find the pals and arun and his family panting terrified beneath the sign
daddy are we going to die here
hasari can see on everyones face this question
today im just a mangy dog on the street but soon i swear ill look other men in the eye
a beat i swear
yet on his face we see the extraordinary pressure to make this promise reality
hasari reaches the head of a line and receives a small handout
turning away he studies the morsel of food
his head aches his belly screams with hunger
but he takes only a single bite then carefully wraps the rest in a cloth and knots it
he feels a tug at his elbow
its a year old boy with thick scholarly spectacles
why live like a beggar when you can live like a maharajah
hasari stares at the boy
a needle injected blood flowing into a bottle
hasari seated on a stool watching his blood leave his body his face broken out in perspiration
i thought you were only taking a little
we pay more we take more
im feeling a little dizzy
rafik and a thin man chatting easily and exchanging ciga rettes with another attendant
his vision blurs
with his free hand he begins to grapple for the atten dant to keep his balance starts to fall
and the a woozy hasari gives rafik his share rafik in turn gives the thin man his share
the thin man bows his farewell
blood is the oil well of the poor brother
now give me another three and ill give you these
he opens his hand with its dirty nails
in it lie a little group of pills like highly colored sweets
what are those
take these and you can give again in a week
while hasari considers rafik pours the pills into hasaris hand takes the three rupees
hasari downs the pills
the same time
and hes gone leaving hasari woozy but at least for the moment blessed to count his money
max lies on his messed bed contorted with his feet up over his head against the wall
a book lies open beside him
a half eaten room service meal many hours old moulders on the bedside table
max is babbling a mock sports case into his fist
theyre in the shotgun
theres the snap from center the clock is running five four three he has an open man at the notre dame twenty for the victory
and he freezes
the fans go a knock at the door
max shuts up falls off the wall
he crosses to the door
poomina is beautiful and exotic looking behind her excessive makeup
the porter pushes the girl gently into the room smiling at max nodding
the door is closed
he may have been receptive to a sweet young girl but not a kid in her teens
got an i
she doesnt get it how old are you
i buy that
she approaches him seductively
i can do anything you want sahib
she fingers the hebrew letter at maxs throat on its gold chain
for a moment max is mesmerized by this child but then as she begins more serious ministra tions he pulls back
hold it time out
time theres time out on the field
is problems sahib
is problems yeah just a couple
no please yes i can theres something desperate in her that makes him put a finger to her lips and say
how bout some chow
she doesnt get it i was just about to order some room service
i call they come we eat
she stares at him
max smokes a monte cristo and watches poomina like a frightened little animal devour the last of a green acres room service meal and then wrap a small piece of
fish in the paper napkin
she looks up at him delivers a small burp
covers her mouth in charming embarrassment
now you are ready for great pleasure yes
watching you eat was my great pleasure
now you go home
as he escorts her toward the door poomina is distressed
max realizes she cant leave empty handed
he pulls out some notes
she hasnt given up though and as he takes the money she stands on tiptoe and kisses him
torn max begins to respond
he stops himself his grip on her causing her discomfort
his breath comes in little bursts
youre a very wet kisser
work on it get in touch in five years
he leads her toward the door
like some lunatic comedy
she locks her knees
he opens the door
goddamn it cut it out
now good night
he muscles her out the door closes it wipes his lips
he stares at a parade of cockroaches gliding along the wall as he listens to her crying quietly on the other side of the door
and he loses
opens the door
poomina stands there the tears stop and a lip twitching smile lights her face
five years already
gee time really flies when you have no moral conviction
she slides into his arms pressing against him
with his shoulder he closes the door leaving us outside
a bare light bulb a scratchy vinyl record on a turn table
poomina watches max do a sleight of hand trick with a coin
he tosses it up brings his hands past each other then holds out his fists she picks on
but the other holds the penny
fooled she laughs
he does it again she points to one fist empty then other also empty
max reaches behind her ear and
produces the coin
she loves it her laughter escalating
but then she seesm to read something in the b
where we see four thugs two of whom will become known to us as the goonda a capo to the local mafia chieftan and ashoka son of the local godfather
ashoka works on a pimple on his chin
the goonda meticulously cleans a spot of mud with spit from one of his expensive new running shoes
max eyes the thugs eyeing him
quit lookin at us
this remark goes over big with the thugs
max doesnt care
he knocks off the last of the beer in his bottle
the bartender brings them two shots of something in two unmatched glasses
special drink for you sahib
only the most man can drink it
you make try
for you i would drink battery acid
who that finish first
she puts her glass to her lips and in a childish exaggerated way mimes waiting for him to commence a drinking race with her
the two of them toss off whats in their glasses
the bangla in maxs glass is stronger than battery acid
he does an elaborate routine involv ing the pain the surprise the sheer awfulness of the drink
but puts it down with mock machismo
i really dont think so oh no nay nay
i never lose the truly irrelevant contest
we have fun some more
i bet again
she turns to the bartender calls for two more
all the while in the b
the goonda and his two thugs watch emotionlessly and ashoka works on his acne
max sings take it to the limit with enormous inebriated sincerity as poomina helps him out of the bar
theres a big black motorcycle parked outside
max glances at it as they start down the alley
as he looks back to the road ahead he finds the goonda in front of him
max isnt so drunk that he doesnt sense what this is about
he looks behind him
indeed the other two goons are there
ashoka straddles the big cycle
seek punishment and ye shall find
knowing whats coming max nevertheless unleashes a beautiful howl and tries to trample the goonda off tackle
from behind hes hit with a length of stick
he goes down looks up through blasted eyes at ashoka as two sticks now land against his shoulder and his head
the pals sleep beneath the sign
hasari awakens from restive sleep to the sound of a fight
he gets up
the others awaken
dont go what are you doing
it sounds like someone needs help
hasari bolts for the corner
as hasari turns into the head of the alley he can see three men beating someone a fourth man standing off to the side watching
what are you doing
calling back a mans being beaten here
as hasari runs down the alley the motorcycle fires up and screams off and the three goons take flight
hasari runs up reaches out to max whos barely on his feet
as hasari touches max max turns and belts hasari in the nose nailing hasari to the wall as max collapses at hasaris feet
hasari grabs his nose with one hand and kneels beside the fallen max
as a shadow moves and startles hasari
he peers into the dark
and poomina steps into the light
the crucifix sways
now maxs eyes rack focus to the cherubic face of joan bethal peering at the camera without sympathy
max on a cot in a tiny spare room a butterfly bandage under one eye
joan irish short stout hovers over him
behind her hasari pal
good morning junior welcome to our country
max manages to sit up
wishes he hadnt
oh i like the way the room moves in circles
checking out his accommodations i suppose i should inquire where i am
youre in the city of joy
is that geographic or spiritual
oh now we require that each visitor decide that for himself
this gentleman and a young lady brought you here
did i do that to your nose
as hasari nods im sorry
hasari shrugs smiles
and a gigantic rat drops in maxs lap
he leaps to his feet and against the wall
the rat scurries away
what was that a shetland pony
i would have to inspect it more closely but i believe that was one of our economy size rats
max clambers for the door
too late joan thinks to say
watch your max cracks his head on the door frame
thanks got it
he ducks outside for some air
in the dawn light he finds himself in a small square in a slum an open sewer running before him
pardon the expression but jesus h
from the tea shop surya a stout old hindu man dressed in western clothes raises a hand in greeting to joan
on the door max and joan have come through city of joy self help school clinic
across the way a young man is dandling a baby on his knee rubbing its back and sniffing at its neck
small group of children around a blackboard with a teacher margareta doing numbers
ram chandar the rickshaw puller readies to go out to work
trying to orient himself max turns
to find perhaps fifty people largely women and children staring at him
he knows them by type patients
he looks at the sign on the door
you a doctor
oh no im a corporate executive
doctor arrives at half seven but only three days a week
this is obviously one of those three days
what brings you to our country
i came to find my white light
i take it you didnt find it
kept opening the doors and windows of my spirit but couldnt see a goddamn thing
what do you do in america
max is slow to answer
discreetly hasari hangs back listens
oh how exciting
must be something illegal
are you a criminal of some sort
i suppose that depends how you define the word im a doctor
how long are you here
perhaps i could recruit you for forget it
youve got your non practicing catholics
im a non practicing doctor
how very distressing
found out i just really dont like sick people
well im outta here
i owe you one
i cant imagine ever divining how to collect but there are a few of us indians you know who believe the tourist trade ought to be encouraged
max turns to hasari
hasari is incredibly shy can barely meet maxs eyes
thank you very much
he goes for his money
max finds his pockets empty
then reaches for his wrist his watch is gone and then his throat his chai is gone too
im afraid they cleaned you out
ram heres your first rider
to max take this
she holds out several rupees toward him
all eyes on them
go on its all right
youll owe me two
max in the rickshaw hasari running alongside ram an exuberant smile slashed across his face
you see i can keep up
keep up of course
anyone can run at this pace
but you think its easy to run and to pull
i can do it
i could pull it
come on give him a shot
hes as fast as you and looks twice as strong
will you still pay me when he runs you into a ditch
i trust the man
suddenly ram comes to a stop
all right you come step in here
hasari looks on max with enormous gratitude
ram puts the shafts down has a short coughing fit spits some phlegm looks at max
i hope youre taking something for that
ram waves him off as hasari lifts the shafts to his hips
now fine pull go
hasari tries to pull but the center of gravity isnt easy to find
this is enormously difficult and hasaris very clumsy at it
the street is crowded
the traffic is beginning to back up behind them
the driver and conductor of the tram let fly a tirade of insults
what did i tell you
what do you think this is some village street
youve got to move quickly
he turns to max
you see it takes a gift
i say he can do it
ill bet you the fare he can do it
play by play what do you think rickshaw fans can he do it
the crowd isnt in for fun
hasari strains forward
the rickshaw moves with him
ram moves alongside shouting instructions and oaths
a cop comes on the run screaming at hasai
which makes ram importune more strongly and max joke more vociferously
even under this incredible pressue hasari gains confidence and begins to move quicker earning shouts of approval from max and ram who now has trouble keeping up as they make
their way through the maelstrom an avalanche of oaths following them
at first all we see are feet on a marble floor
the goondas in his running shoes then ram and hasaris bare feet
this is the partitioned splendor of an old house sprinkled with the relics of a grand colonial past
everything is baroque rotting and somehow impressive
hasari has never been anywhere like this and is caught between curiosity and fear of breathing
the three men enter a large room shuttered from the sun light dusty and packed with a ramshackle assortment of furniture
two fat blue titmice perch in a cage next to ambitious plaster portrait of napolean
sitting behind a desk is ashoka leaning over a mirror squeezing a balky pimple
near a large window his year old father ghatak in a european jacket and dhoti works with intense concen tration at repairing a pair of broken glasses with a twist
of fine wire
the three new arrivals stand silent and respectful before the desk
at last without raising his head
not a tongue between you then
yes yes i am wondering sir we are is it possible you might have something for my friend
ram indicates hasari as if there might be some question to whom hes referring
ashoka attacks the pimple
let me explain it for your ears sir
my cousin from bihar has just arrived in our city theyve brought a small present of respect
the goonda places a small bundle of rupees on the desk
ashoka allows himself a disinterested glance at hasari
so you want to be a human horse
i have personally witnessed his excellence yes
he doesnt talk
can he neigh at least
to hasari you do your ears function
oh yes babu
like a horse
ashoka pulls back his lips shows his teeth and imitates a neigh ne igh
well yes babu i can do that
would you like me to imitate a horse
finished with the pimple ashoka wipes a finger on his shirt and takes a helping off a plate of sweetcakes as
behind him the godfather walks up to the desk putting his glasses on
he barely glances at his son but waves him out of the chair
ashoka doesnt like it but he steps aside
as he does he turns a look of hatred on hasari
through no fault of his own hasari has made an enemy
ghatak chews on a pan and casts a benevolent eye on hasari
lift your longhi
the godfather looks at his legs and thighs
the wise men of our nation say that nirvana is the attainment of a state of supreme detachment
for me nirvana is counting each evening one by one the rupees earned by my two thousand and forty six rickshaws
hasari doesnt know whether to respond
a glance at ram tells him not to
ghatak gestures for hasari to lower his longhi
you are with family
i have a wife and three children babu
and they must eat heh
the world is full of open mouths
he chews on this a moment then opens a drawer
and holds a small tinkling rickshaw bell toward hasari
hasari understands that incredibly he has a job
his breath is so shallow he can barely utter his gratitude
he takes the bell
i shall be eternally grateful to you
from now on i shall be as the youngest of your brothers
these days its a crop nobody plants
the godfather turns his beatific and godlike smile on hasari pal
the pals load the rickshaw that stands at the road with ram in it
there are embraces with the bruised arun and his family
we hear the bell tinkling as the rickshaw pulled by hasari carrying ram and aloka holding shambu arrives amrita and manooj trotting beside their father
surya selima other neighbors greet them as they come
the pals glance into the school at joan whos teaching an evening class
reverentially they follow ram inside as joan watches
a door opens
faces peer through the door
ram lights an oil lamp
in the glow the family looks around their tiny space
hardly able to suppress smiles
someone has blessed us
a job a roof a school
soon ill be able to send money home
looking at amrita and put away a little bit for your dowry
in their excitement the boys run
and up to the roof under the stars
we look up with them and pan down to max on his balcony playing his trumpet as we continue to
about twenty tattered street kids faces shining with en joyment
they run and shout as they pursue something just out of frame
the cause of the excitement is hasari running toward us feet flying as he pulls the rickshaw loaded with a huge sack
manooj and shambu are clinging to the sides of the machine
ram stands in the center of the square
he shouts a command and hasari struggles to bring the rickshaw to a stop
its not easy and sunil whos arriving has to jump out of the way to the accompaniment of apologies from hasari and ram and hoots of laughter from the children
outside the clinic a line of perhaps seventy five wait patiently watching as hasari takes off again
the wheels of the rickshaw hit a rut
hasari loses control the sack tips back and hasari is lifted into the air feet kicking as he tries to regain his balance
aloka and amrita sitting near the bawling ram cant hold back their laughter
the square is set with obstacles
as ram shouts instruc tion we see hasari negotiate them with much increased skill
he stops in front of a small group
its his family plus joan and surya
with an exhausted smile he signs to aloka and amrita to get in
they do and hasari takes them triumphantly around the circuit
hasaris triumphant ride continues and we hasari rubs the moonstone in his ring on the shafts then touches his heart and his forehead
a school girl in uniform approaches the rickshaw stand
we also see several other pullers rassoul chomotkar ramatullah
let hasari go
the line of rickshaw pullers turns to hasari
the other pullers wish him well as he comes forward
his heart pounds ever so politely he helps the school girl into his carriage
she gives him the address of the st
im sorry i dont know where that is
youre my very first passenger
well i hope i bring you luck
she gives him a sweet smile
that way and then to the right
his moment has arrived
he looks at ram
and thrusts his hips forward setting off into the insanity of the traffic eyes flicking left and right
a horn rails at him and a taxi tries to run him down calling and laugh ing as hasari jumps in terror
calling feed the police
other pullers laugh call after hasari
and as he approaches the first corner he manages to pull out a rupee and deposit it into the hand of the impassive traffic policeman and then turn right
the school girl hands him a slip of paper
this is my home address
pick me up promptly at seven each morning
yes thank you you can depend on me
the girl runs into the school yard met immediately by friends
hasari looks around at the clean bustling school at all the children in their crisp uniforms and a look of great yearning comes over his face
max is trying to explain to the waiter what he wants
you know cow
minced little salt pepper slap it flat like this throw it on the grill flip it
now though he just glimpses the shiny gas tank and engine of a motorcycle around the hip of the waiter
he leans out
ashoka astride his motorcycle gunning the engine as a boy runs out of a store with an armload of cassettes
put it on the grill ill be right back
he pulls the boys ear revs the engine to go
and senses someone close
he turns to find an american hovering at his shoulder
you know i have to say you really dont look jewish
i believe thats mine
he reaches for the necklace with the hebrew letter
ashoka recognizes max
looks around for help
there is none
dont touch me
no one touches me
max grabs ashoka
who breaks free and guns the cycle down a side street
max gives chase his aching ribs slowing him a bit
ashoka glancing back begins to open up some distance
yet max hangs tough weaving like a broken field runner through the mass of bodies and vehicles
now suddenly he loses ashoka
he has to make a choice about this corner or that one
a cop steps into his path
he sees ashoka up ahead
hes hopelessly out of breath
good timing him
he cant talk and breathe
he points desperately
the cop glances where max points but he makes no move to give chase
may i see your passport
im in the middle of a high speed chase
that guy passport please
a crowd has begun to form
in the distance we see a group of girls carrying cricket equipment coming at us
its in my hotel room
passport please now
ready my lips i do not have my passport with me at this
he gets it ah i see said the blind man
the cop obviously is doing this at ashokas behest
max starts around the cop
the cop however sticks his club in maxs face theres fire in maxs eyes
but a hand takes the cops stick before max can make a big mistake
the girls with the cricket equipment and margareta the teacher
the hand belongs to joan bethel
well all right junior so youll owe me three
a scribe finishes writing a note home for hasari
the scribe hands it to hasari
we are well
manooj does not go in the cinema
i am earning my living as a rickshaw wallah
it is my honor to send you this
with great pride hasari pays the scribe seals the money order with the message in an envelope licks the flap and puts the envelope into the mail slot
surya plays his zither
max and joan sit at a table
max pops little boiled candies into his mouth from a dish on the table
oh it was just a whim in the beginning really to try to convince them not to be so bloody passive that they could pull themselves up on their own
i get a little money from a swiss organization
now its become a bit more than i can manage
its got to be like trying to drill a hole in water though
we just need a few more hands on this little life raft weve set afloat here
they stare at each other
shambu has become one of suryas tea boys and refills their tea
you know what ive come to think in my middle age max
nope no earthly idea
youre pretty much outta my league thought wise
there are really only three actions open to a person
only three okay
and what are they
to run to spectate to commit
max peers at her a moment then around the square
has it occurred to you that this obsession with charity is really a flaw in your character
its not charity dear child its love
youre very badly twisted around arent you
one of us sure as hell is
the clinics part time doctor sunil dasgupta comes out of the clinic after a very long day
im off for home sister joan
a pleasure to meet you dr
see you day after tomorrow
good night god bless doctor
a beat generous young man
as he watches sunil head away max senses something com ing at him from the side
a soccer ball almost hits him he jumps up handles the ball athletically
he begins to play with manooj and several other children
shambu leaves his post in the tea shop to join them
are you the american doctor
are you coming here to help us
no im the visiting american soccer star el max
do you go to the cinema in america el max
when i was your age two movies plus cartoons every saturday
aloka and amrita are cooking on an open fire bucket
max almost knocks the fire over
aloka looks at him apolo getic shy
as manooj knocks shambu down at maxs feet
max scoops the little boy up
there you go little guy
ut whats this
reaching behind shambus ear max produces a boiled sweet
aloka watches this with a smile their eyes touch again
as manooj lets out a cry at the sight of their father
ram and hasari return home
hasari can hardly walk
shambu runs to his father explaining excitedly
daddy there is the doctor from america
he saw two movies every saturday
whats in your fist
shambu pries his fathers fist open seeds
so we can watch something grow
children leaning down as smoke wafts up
we follow the smoke down to maxs cigar
aloka and amrita laying the food out
shambu rubbing his fathers aching legs as hasari and manooj plant the seeds in hasaris little tea caddy full of earth from home
max is watching this family huddled around the father
another few months ill be able to pay off the moneylender in my village and go home and open a grocery shop
all around me sacks overflowing with all kinds of dal and rice aromatic spices piles of vegetables
and at night ill lie on my back beneath the trees sniffing fresh aubergines
this beautiful picture burrows into hasaris mind
for a moment he goes there home to the village
if my wife will let me come within a hundred miles of the place where she herself resides
ram laughs hasari smiles
amrita i saw a beautiful wedding sari today
amrita is terribly embarrassed
it was six hundred rupees only
he laughs at the impossibility of the price
thats only dollars isnt it
if you have it
ill send it to you from america when i get home tomorrow
thats very generous but no thank you
repayment for punching you in the nose
you have repaid me by sharing our supper
joan indicates that max should let it go
hasari ever so carefully waters the tea box
doctor big brother i myself would be willing to accept a gift
could you give me five rupees in a note ten perhaps
my ankle is badly swelled the higher the number the more the swelling sinks
max has to laugh
i dont have a cent on me
ill owe you
now everyones attentions is taken by a cry from shambu who expels his breath his terrified eyes directing our attention to
its an amazing sight
two lepers anouar bearded with a sharp intelligent unmarked face makes his way along on a small wheeled board at an amazingly fast pace ahead of said a huge mute
they stop some feet away
lepers arent often welcome
out from behind said steps poomina
joan di my sister
she sees max gasps throws herself behind said
joan looks at max he starts to speak she points a finger that silences him
it was poomina who brought you to us
she has herself and her sister to support
its all right poomina
anouar what is it
she moves to them
theyre all three badly out of breath
its her time
but something is wrong
the midwives dont know what to do
sunil could he help perhaps
sunil isnt here
meeta will die
joan turns to max who hasnt heard the exchange
max i wouldnt ask but its an emergency
a pregnancy gone awry
its a leper
could you have a look
max is clearly thrown by the sight of the lepers
i dont have any experience with leprosy
good christ son because shes a leper doesnt mean shes not built like a woman
i can run and get dr
its too far
i could help
ive had three babies
you cant do that
theyre outcasts theyre unclean
there are murmurs of assent from the others
its not contagious
a beat everyone fixed on max
youre a doctor how can you not help
the moon reflects off the dark puddles of muddy water that line the side of the railway tracks
anouar propels his board with astonishing agility along the path said and poomina running with him
max joan carrying a first aid bag aloka and hasari following slipping and sliding on the rough ground with its puddles and sewage
the little procession arrives outside the three rough huts made of bamboo plastic sheeting cloth wood and cardboard
a few shadows materialize
lepers staring silently
anouar points into a hut
joan and aloka precede max inside
max forgets to bend and bumps his head
the only light is the feeble waver from a candle
the blind meeta lies on a rough mattress on the ground
her ragged sari is pulled up to her middle
her face runs with sweat her hair is plastered to her face
a girl with black eyes is fanning her with a piece of wood
meeta sends up a soft uninterrupted moan
a wedge of blood soaked cloth is between her legs
a middle age leper is leaning over her a midwife encouraging meeta with a string of commands in their own language
max kneels aloka at his side
his breathing becomes shallow
but then he pulls off the blood soaked bandages
between meetas legs he can just make out the bottom of a foot
the child is breached
maybe already dead
will she die
max goes into reflex actions
joan has opened the first aid kit
theres a flashlight among the medicine alcohol compresses scissors etc
he hands the flash light to aloka as
to joan pull me two c
s of coramine
he nods at aloka she illuminates the scene
uh oh uh oh whos this coming down the lane
why its is it possible way over here in india yes its mr
he comes to a stop
everyone stares at him
for a moment he stays frozen
aloka reaches out instinctively wipes the sweat from his eyes
this gesture seems to free him he looks at her looks at the room and its expectant trusting faces
im going to have to turn it the baby
tell her she has to relax these muscles as much as she can
he doesnt finish the sentence
aloka speaks softly to meeta as max takes meetas arm makes a tourniquet
joan hands him the syringe and he injects
hands the syringe back to joan and begins to work at turning the baby
aloka takes meetas hand and its a moment before we realize aloka with her fine hand is holding meetas fingerless palm
a small group waits trying to determine from the sounds whats happening inside
anouar pours tea from a pot on the small fire offers the cup to hasari
hasari stares at the cup doesnt want to be impolite but more than that doesnt want to touch the cup
he shakes his head smiles
anouar drinks off the tea
sweat pours down maxs face into his eyes
he shakes it out
aloka leans forward and with her new sari wipes the sweat away again
max nods thanks
tell her again to breathe in short little bursts now
aloka does the same to meeta
meeta tries to cooperate
and suddenly max has the baby turned
now tell her to push
the midwife the little girl aloka lean forward
no one is sitting now
everyone hangs close to the door
only hasari remains apart seated on a tree stump in the middle of the quad
he coughs suppresses it
ive got the head
come on little baby come on little baby
be alive be alive be alive
aloka wipes the sweat away again
he looks at her his voice squeezed out through his teeth
weve got it weve got it
he seems as released as meeta
then he gives a last gentle tug and a cry squeezes out of the little piece of life in his hands
max is fairly overwhelmed by the life in his hands
poomina steps close a smile on her lovely face and touches the baby in maxs hands
max joan aloka and hasari walk in silence down nizamudhin lane
there is only the mingled sound of coughing moaning and a transistor radio nearby playing a popular song
outside the clinic they stop
she takes his hand
for a non practicing doctor that was pretty practiced
never been so scared in my life
its a warm open moment between them
but now theres the ongoing desperation of her needs
max please wont you change your mind
we desperately need another doctor
think about it just give us a couple of months
cant do it
maybe youve got it in you to be a saint
i just dont
then what do you want
what are you going to be when you grow up
good night aloka hasari
joan goes inside leaving max aloka and a very uncom fortable hasari alone a moment
thank you for allowing me to go with you
you could make a helluva nurse
a little smile comes over her face no ones ever paid her that kind of compliment
she goes into rams hut leaving max and hasari now
i think perhaps you are a good man
hasari brings his hands together and goes inside
max hears joan praying inside
jesus my brother you who i am trying to believe are the light and salvation of the puking world aloka sits huddled with her husband while their children sleep they
please see that we are living in madness and darkness here
and we need help
om jesus om and amen
suddenly he hurtles into motion
he runs down the alley his stride stretching out swallowing up the distance between here and the world beyond the city of joy in great gulps
a busy urban airport as opposed to the small country airport in which we saw max earlier
yes yes yes thats right yes
i turned in your ticket
its a small place its sweltering and its packed with hundreds of families shoulder to shoulder
though betsys trying to be discreet its not a very private place as we see by the number of people watching max and betsy
i bought it i got a refund
but i want to go home with you
you want to go home with me
then prove it
good how name it
buy yourself a ticket
i would love to do that betsy ilene boy would i love to do just that but im financially embarrassed at the use your credit cards

i want to go home with you betsy ilene kahn
because i have a vision

he mimes a kind of house shape
i see you and me betsy ilene kahn nibbling toward each other through a quarter pounder with cheese chugalugging a frosty light beer great taste
i want to go bowling besty ilene kahn
he fires a strike through the watching crowd
oh my lord amighty i want so many american things oh stop it

and stop calling me betsy ilene kahn
isnt that your name

i hate you
na ya dont
i stood by you for three years
i supported you through your internship
it was never working
what have i been thinking all these years that youd change
youre the most self pitying self destructive self
she cant find anything fierce enough so she abates tries to get it together to make a dignified exit
but youve taught me something max
you never finish anything
well i quit
ive found my light and im free of you
she heads for the gate people parting to give her a wide berth
will you at least call my mother and ask her to empty my savings account and wire do it yourself max
call her collect
you should have called her weeks ago anyway just because shes your mother
to herself white light white light
she hands her ticket and boarding pass over and shes through the gate
max turns to find the audience fixed on him
guerilla theater folks
all the worlds a stage
dont know if that word reached you here yet
if youd care to show your appreciation by a small donation
and several instant offers of rupees
a beat then
aw what the hell
swallowing his incredible embarrassment max takes the money
the line is long
at this moment joan is checking a childs throat with a tongue depressor
aloka is walking beside her with a fistful of depressors and a bag for disposal
hasari and ram are getting ready to leave
anouar appears at joans waist
good morning joan di
loeb said many of us could be helped that all it would take is money for medication
anouar hands joan some newspaper in which something is wrapped
joan opens the paper
inside is a good deal of money
please buy the medication for us
if we cannot come here to receive it perhaps dr
loeb would come to us
ill be happy to buy the medication but dr
loeb is not part of this endeavor anouar there is only his cherished memory
then perhaps i am having visions
anouars focus is up the lane
joan follows his focus to
a buzz about maxs heroics hands coming together
max raises a hand in benediction makes the sign of the cross
max claps hasari on the shoulder hasari brings his hands together and gives max a genuinely pleased smile
children circle and touch him manooj and shambu among them
getting ready to practice medicine without a license sister joan
you dont see me soliciting conversions do you
well well well i do so love to be surprised
okay for starters pick me out someone with something easy i can heal make me look good
to aloka aloka youre my assistant lets go
aloka smiles she nods she accepts
max knock it off give us a bit of hush
as he does what happened
i changed my mind
and im a bloody bathing beauty
okay so i got left
so how long am i stuck with you
two weeks or until mom sends me a ticket
not worth the aggravation of your prattle every day
six months and not a day less
six weeks and thats my best offer
two months and thats my final offer
a beat done
jesus and mary
the lone ranger rides again
and now smiles creep onto all their faces as max goes inside followed by joan
and then aloka after she looks at hasari gets his nod of encouragement
too late joan says
watch your thud
thanks got it
the children titter
the teacher margareta admonishes them to pay attention and be polite
as we the wheels spinning furiously and then stopping abruptly
hasari dripping with sweat panting
the school girl comes running toward him
after her in the b
her hasari where have you been
ive been waiting almost five minutes
im sorry forgive me
it wont happen again
were not going to school today
youre taking my mother and me to the bara bazar
im getting married
oh i am so pleased for you
panting helplessly hasari smiles
as he helps the school girls mother into the rickshaw
good morning hasari
good morning missus
briskly he takes up the shafts and sets off
turn right at that corner hasari
its farther that way missus
no not really
turn there please
obediently hasari turns as ramatullah heading the other way passes they wave and hasari pulls away from us
he helps them out of the rickshaw in front of an expensive looking bridal shop
you must remember this shop hasari when its your daughters time
this is the nicest in the city
the mother gives the school girl a withering look and hustles her into the shop
hasari can just barely hear
dont say things like that
hes never going to be able to buy anything here
he watches from outside a look of determination coming over his face
suddenly a pair of fingers takes hold of his ear twisting his face painfully
ashoka with the goonda and two henchmen in the b
how will my father eat this evening
i was just
you have a daughter
called to work hasari starts for his rickshaw but ashoka hangs on to his ear for another uncomfortable moment
as he slips a rupee into hasaris shirt pocket
give this to sister joan and your friend the doctor when you go home
now he hands hasari a sealed envelope and turns his ear loose
hasari springs toward his passenger
max with his stethoscope to meetas baby
meeta in a brightly colored sari and a lot of bracelets and aloka looks on
poomina clings to the wall
hes just malnourished
is she giving him the milk we gave her or selling it
aloka asks meeta in hindi
meeta clearly swears shes giving the baby the milk
aloka pushes her
tell her to give all the milk to the baby
aloka does so as max bounces the baby coos to it play fully
the baby pees all over him
aloka translates quickly
meeta starts apologizing
poomina cant help laughing
max reminds meeta that thats once for each of the two weeks of the babys life
aloka soothes meeta as she hustles her poomina and the baby out then quickly begins to wipe maxs face with a clean rag
this isnt something shes accustomed to doing but shes doing it before she has time to think
max finds himself conscious of her closeness to him
and then she becomes suddenly self conscious and she backs off ducks her head
he peeks up under
she looks at him
so does she
sunil stands outside the clinic rolling his sleeves down
anouar waits at a polite distance
exhausted but exhilarated max and aloka emerge with an elderly woman patient max singing chuck berry to the womans embar rassed delight theyre really rockin in boston in philadelphia p
sunil looks at his american colleague smiles a small smile
good night ill see you day after tomorrow
good night sunil
deep in the heart of texas around the frisco bay
manooj and shambu come charging at max with the soccer ball hoping to engage him as a playmate
hasari returns home with his rickshaw
selima waves at max indicates shes cooking dinner
joan wanders out of the school as the kids are released and go charging through the square
joan has the pal kids in hand
very special supper for you tonight doctor big brother
will you stay
wish i could selima because im sure hungry
sixteen hours of pestilence and misery always make me famished
i have to go with my man anouar tonight
ive got lepers to heal
no no you know how patient we are
to aloka youre not tired are you
not if youre not
between hasari and aloka theres just a flicker of tension evidently this has become maxs and her normal day
but hes also worried about the note from ashoka
joan joins them with the pal children
well i think weve got three very good potential scholars here
behind the childrens backs she points at manooj and indicates the kids really got a head
given him some time here hell be good enough for a proper school
its more than a father could hope
fifteen years from now miami florida dr
manooj pal in association with dr
for a moment hasari is swept up in this little reverie then remembers reality
giving her the note from the godfathers son
for you and the doctor
amidst instant concern joan opens the envelope
looks at max
we hear the sound of bangladesh music
the music is of days gone by playing on an old radio
sticks of burning incense send off trails of smoke
the godfather mr
ghatak looking infirm wipes a tear from his eye
now we see max and joan seated on cushions before the godfather tea in hand
max catches a glimpse in an anteroom of several thugs with several young girls one of whom is poomina
she catches a glimpse of max as she disappears past a door
a moment later her head peeks around the door frame
she brings her hands together
poomina quickly disappears
maxs attention is pulled back to the godfather
i understand that youre interested in expanding your clinic and free school and that you intend to start treating lepers in the city of joy
wed like to better serve the entire community mr
thats very good
and wed be pleased to rent you suitable space
but you must understand that certain payments will go up
i understand the rent would have to go up if we rent larger quarters from you mr
ghatak but why should we have to pay more protection
more people more potential trouble
if i dont charge you what will i tell others
but we cant afford it
surely if you can expand you can pay more
joan throws up her hands how do you reason with this man
am i stupid but isnt this protection money money were paying you to protect us from you
we live in chaotic times miss bethel doctor
i control the city of joy and maintain it as a model of harmony
its a miracle but a very fragile miracle
and how are we threatening your miracle
i admire your courage in choosing to work in such a violent place miss bethel
your neighbors in the city of joy theyre not educated theyre given to violence to meanness i can promise you they wont like having lepers among them but because they
know youre under my protection
he dispatches a globule of spit into the copper urn next to his right toe
and tries to get to his feet
the goonda hurries forward to help him
doctor do you like our music
well i cant say ive developed a craving for it yet
its difficult to appreciate what we dont understand isnt it
let me put it another way the world is a terrible place
only the ruthless prevail
my son will make the arrangements with you
one of the thugs helps the godfather outside where in the b
we see him listening to his music and pottering in his garden
as max and joan turn max finds himself face to face with ashoka who wears maxs necklace and chai
theres a long pause as the two of them take the others measure
to ashoka i like your taste in neckwear
joan puts a cautioning hand on maxs arm
ashoka seems just the slight bit uneasy dealing with max and so keeps trying to direct himself to joan
he smokes a long indian cigarette
the entire package were proposing will cost you three thousand rupees a month
joan is taken aback by the sum
if we pay you that we wont have any money for supplies
im told youre very resourceful
i think i see a solution
what if we were to work out a profit sharing arrangement
we give you a share of our net profit
how do you expect to make a profit off of lepers and the poor doctor
beats the hell outta me asshole
but youve obviously found a way
the question would seem to be whether ashoka will have max killed here or outside the house
his eyes on max ashoka puts the cigarette out against the back of his hand
and smiles at max
joan is furious
have you gone right off your rocker
these people dont have a sense of humor
are you trying to get yourself killed
i dont think so
but with me any duplicity is possible
he tickles her she knocks his hands away he tickles her again
stop it you
he doesnt stop and as she storms off down the street he stays right on her tickling away
its dark and claustrophobic
the air vibrates with the squeal and clatter of metal
about twenty kids sit in a line back to back manipulating aseries of lethal and unprotected lathes and polishers
no one can hear his neighbor
hasari with shambu in the rickshaw arrives to take the children home
as he looks inside he notices
not far from amrita sits a handsome boy subash
he catches amritas eyes
amrita is sweetly embarrassed to find her father staring at her
but he cant help but smile
at the same time hes re minded moment to moment of his various obligations
the three kids in the rickshaw
an ambassador car swerves in front of hasari forcing him to jam to a stop jolting the kids
the goonda sits in the back seat with ashoka who carves his fingernails with a switchblade knife
he crooks a finger at hasari
hasari leans close and ashoka takes him by the ear
who gave you your rickshaw
who provides the food you eat
he gives hasaris ear a last tug
and the car continues on leaving hasari
he looks at his children ashamed to have been cowed
manooj fixes his father with a hard look
leaning over listening taking in the aroma of
he sits slightly apart from joan sunil aloka ram hasari selima margareta surya saladdin ashish and shanta aristotle john mehboub anouar and said
hasari is stretched out aloka rubbing his screaming legs
throughout the following their eyes meet and deflect
the godfather is at least civilized
the son is vicious
remember the last elections the molotov coctails the blows with iron bars
theyll throw us out
we wont be able to find anyone else to rent to us
well just have to agree to pay what he wants
neither nature nor the people with the power have any conscience
we have to pay
a sigh escapes surya
he shakes his head
eyes flick at him
what do you say doctor big brother
i think we must try to break the godfathers hold on us
this is startling and is met with a babble of cautious agreement and dispute
please hear me out
but i think we have to be very cautious
how the hell do you proceed with caution against these people
you have to risk everything
you try to negotiate with these people you make compromises with them theyll eat you alive
stand up against them now and theyll fold
i guarantee it
underneath theyre cowards they got no guts
we show them were strong and thell just move on to easier pickings
you have an airplane ticket
still hes clearly piqued a lot of support
you know max this is not american gangster television
yes if youre wrong you dont have to be here
im not wrong
you bow your heads you plead with your gods to do what you wont do yourselves
you put up with this nightmare as if there were no choice
im telling you if you dont stand up to that little pimple face now hell own you for the rest of your lives
everyone stares at him
many of them want to buy his commitment
theres another large sigh from surya
aloka and hasaris eyes bang off of each other she silently urging him to speak
hes deeply conflicted and deeply frightened
even though i am invisible to some of you and i dont have a complete set of legs to stand on i stand with the doctor big brother
maybe nature doesnt have a conscience or those with the power but dont we
said the giant mute mades an unintelligible sound in his throat but clearly hes agreeing with anouar
i agree with anouar and max daddah
i think its worth the chance
until aloka and hasaris meet again and out of his terrible fear and conflict he says very shyly
is it permitted to speak
there are quick nods around the room
with great difficulty hasari says his piece
i want my children to be educated and cared for this is our home we have never had such friends
but many of us owe a great debt to the godfather
he is strong and could kill us
but we must choose
i trust my big brother
i say we must stand up
theres still dissension but somewhat more support
said makes a fierce unintelligible supportive sound
surya sighs again
eyes flick at the old man
sister joan what do you think really
well i think max has hit on the heart of what were trying to build here a self help society
each of us has to decide for himself
as for me i suppose i think really that if the bastards are going to suck us dry id like to get in a couple of good left handers before
i turn the other cheek
but who will rent to us
surya clucks his tongue and shakes his head everyone assumes he is preparing a heated refutation of the resisters
his sighs though have been a building commitment
i have a property i will rent you for two hundred rupees a month and not a rupee less
as for protection
you are on your own
many of the faces are uncertain hasaris notable among them
a two cows are shooed out of the ramshackle building as bustling activity on the new clinic begins
cleaning the place
debris being torn out hurled into a pile in the street
b said with the strength of three men holds up a heavy beam while hasari tries to secure it
max hot smelly and hating the place stands in the middle of the room wishing he were elsewhere
the beams starts to slip
max leaps to hasaris side
c we see that max and hasari are thrown together again in some carpentering task in uneasy camaraderie
a finger pokes max on the back
he turns to find poomina holding out two cups of tea
d the whole group shares a meal prepared under the direction of selima though the lepers remain separate from the normals
anouar leads the lepers in singing a song
joan and margareta pick it up as do several other of the normals
e equipment from the old school clinic being moved from the square down here
f max and aloka do one of those dances where two people with arms loaded try to go around each other
finally he says hell stand still and she should go around him
they both laugh
g as max puts medicine into a cabinet ram peeks in nods his approval helpfully passes max something max can reach just fine himself shows max an enormous hole in
his shorts and hits max for ten rupees
h a small truck carrying a charitable organizations logo on the side is being unloaded of powdered milk and various other things
hasari and max move the last cot upstairs and into place beside a window that will come into play at the end it looks down on the street
hasari nods to max indicating he should look
everyone gathered as shanta and ashish put a banner above the door you are invited to the festival of this world and your life is blessed
the assemblage applauds and embraces
hasari smiles at max brings his hands together but doesnt embrace the doctor
everyone lingers adults and children
max plays his trumpet accompanying surya on his zither
manooj hovers over max
doctor big brother arent you going to smoke your evening cigar
max points at his trumpet continues playing
max indicates his pocket
manooj takes out a cigar and a clip
clips the cigar holds it out to max who indi cates manooj should light it and keeps playing
manooj looks at hasari who nods
shambu holds a match to it
everyone watches as if this were a major event
manooj takes a puff chokes offers the cigar to mehboub who takes it puffs passes it
everyone relaxes enjoys the peacefulness of the smoking and the aroma wafting upward
ram taps at maxs elbow
it has come to me tonight to write a letter to my wife
ram produces a mangled one piece letter envelope
he thrusts the paper at max
max takes a pen from his pocket
yes what is the word that word when land is watered
yes yes that word i want that word in the letter
max looks at him nods waits
ram stares at max waits
what would you like to say to your wife
i dont know max daddah
if i knew what to say to my wife id never have left home
everybody laughs though rams remark hits max on a deeper level
manooj slides in beside him
why do you have to go home doctor babu
because he doesnt live here manooj
this is not his home
a look between max and aloka hasaris eyes flicking at both of them
as alokas eyes come to hasari
the cigar reaches ram
as max starts to write ram takes a large puff and blows a huge ring out of his mouth
we follow it
a whole row of faces on rooftops enjoying the cigar
this as we through the wheels we see max come briskly out of the hotel carrying his doctors bag
hes met by the sight of hasari between the shafts of his rickshaw and anouar and meeta perched on the seat
lepers in my neighborhood
doctor big brother please we are pretending not to be lepers
oh oh i didnt get the concept of course not lepers
i think youre going to fool a lot of people
i have only one question why are you here
weve come to take you to the dispensary in grand style on this special day havent we hasari
na ill just trot alongside hasari
no please get in
max climbs into the rickshaw beside the two lepers and hasari pulls away
meetas very excited by this ride through calcutta
you see shes never been sightseeing before
meeta of course is blind
max hasari anouar laugh
youre incorrigible anouar
yes yes i know thank you very much
as the rickshaw disappears into the sea of people and vehicles we hear anouar and max laughing
margareta manooj shambu shoba several other kids and at the end of the line poomina all carrying water on their heads toward the city of joy
suddenly someone whispers to poomina
one of ashokas thugs
she glances after margareta and the other kids who are turning a corner and steps into where ashoka waits
you taking that to the clinic
as she nods you like it there
as she nods and they love your smile dont they
shes fearful now and doesnt respond
he grabs her the water pitcher crashes to the ground he puts his knife into her mouth and lays her face open on both side with his knife
aloka comes toward us leading a group of lepers
her hand goes to her mouth
two hundred normal people lined up outside the gaily be decked dispensary many mothers with small children in their arms
shanta sees aloka gestures to indicate the incredible turn out
the normals at the end of the line turn to look at the approaching lepers
it is too beautiful to believe
as if indeed she were right their path is suddenly cut off by the goonda and a commando of thugs armed with sticks and iron bars backed up by a
group carrying banners with slogans proclaiming in hindi urdu english we dont want lepers here
theres a sudden uneasy silence
behind the thugs a short distance is the policeman who harassed max earlier and another cop
joan hurries forward
good morning sister to the poor
those people arent coming into this neighborhood
they are going to be treated at the dispensary
you have no right to stop them
hasari arrives with max anouar and meeta
go ahead aloka take them inside
the goonda puts his hand on aloka
the policeman in the b
keep their distance
take your hands off her you waster
joan is seized by a sudden fury and grabs the goonda
he grabs her much harder
said growls and pushes forward
several thugs turn step in to neutralize him
joan elbows the goonda and tires to westle free of him
as a reflex he raises his hand
and as he does its seized
max with hasari in the b
max slings the goonda against the side of a truck
that was a mistake doctor
the mistakes yours putz
to aloka get these people inside
aloka starts forward leading the lepers
shes stopped by a sudden blow from the goondas stick across her shoulders knocking her to the ground bleeding from the neck
hasari bolts for his wife gets caught up in the melee
max swings around on the goonda and for the first time we realize how strong he is and that he knows how to box
the goonda goes down and violence erupts
anouar is chopping at the legs of one of the thugs working on said
the massive said tears free and starts to beat the crap out of the two thugs holding him
the noise brings everyone out of the square those lined up at the clinic the children from the school
sunil comes flying out of the clinic
a stampede of those waiting outside the dispensary and those normally in the crowded alley ensues
shanta runs inside for help
shopkeepers barricade their shop windows
one of the thugs pours gasoline over anouar and lights a match
hasari kneels beside aloka when he sees the match ignite the tiny leper
without thinking hasari hurls himself on top of anouar rolling him in the dirt and against his own body to put out the flames
joan shouts demanding the violence stop
shes hit from behind she decides talk isnt going to do it
she grabs a piece of lumber and starts to fight
an explosion in the doorway scattering anyone who remains in the area of the dispensary doorway badly wounding mehboub
more people with sticks
hasari goes down under several bodies
max reaches aloka helps her up sends her toward the clinic
he tears an attacker off of hasari and they fight back to back a moment
a second explosion near them
and through the smoke max sees
ashoka astride his motorcycle behind his dark glasses with more thugs these with molotov cocktails and pick axes ready to raze the clinic and school and the surrounding neighborhood
sunil drags mehboub inside
people chant white monkeys go home
white monkeys go home
no lepers here
no lepers here
the thugs cock their iron bars and bricks and molotov cocktails
max picks up an iron bar of his own and starts for ashoka
suddenly theres a detonation followed by a blast of air so fierce max is thrown to the ground
a bottle of gasoline has exploded just behind him
hes enveloped in smoke
an assailant bears down on joan with a cutlass
as the assailant is about to strike hasari seizes the attacker and hurls him backward
ashish steps in and slashes the assailant with his own weapon startling even repelling hasari
from all over the lane young fighters have come and joined the fray not bothering to choose sides but merely enjoying the release
hasari lunges for a woman under attack by a boy arriving too late to stop the boy from plunging his knife into the womans belly
hasari fights his way to the woman but she staggers into the mob
max knocks down one of the thugs only to have another hand grasp his shoulder
he turns fist cocked to find poomina her hands holding her face together
slowly she takes hands away
the sides of her face have been laid open
max sweeps her up in his arms heads for the clinic
oh little girl little girl
joan is suddenly beside ashoka
all right then so by all means protect us
ashoka raises a hand the goonda blows a whistle and the fighting stops as suddenly as it began
the com batants are breathing heavily
there is silence but for the groans and cries of the wounded and grieving
in a world such as ours everyone needs protection
for the fee we discussed from this day forward i can assure you nothing like this will happen again
saladdin is at joans shoulder
ashoka points a finger at hasari
i warned you about the company you keep
he revs his motorcycle and screeches away leaving hasari staring after him in his dust
people peer in through every opening
mehboubs chest is bandaged
sunil squeezes through the packed courtyard and hallway ashish carrying a wounded woman behind him
hasari steps into a doorway us with him
max blood crusted on her face sutures poominas awful facial wound as aloka prepares a compress
her face will it
if shes very careful and doesnt do anything to open the wound the scarring will be minimal
to poomina do you understand
you have to stay here
to joan you make her stay here
dont goddamn try joan
goddamn do it
poomina peers through her pain at max his hands putting her back together
a litany i hate this place i hate this place i hate this place
max looks at the doorway and he locks eyes with hasari
max breaks the contact
hasari stares at him as we hear the godfathers music on the radio
a hand tap tap taps against a ledger
ashoka sits behind a little table picking absently at his face
the goonda is slouched near the table smoking a cigarette and fiddling with a thin switch
its dif ficult for him to show ashoka the respect his inherited position gives him
the goonda has a bruise under one eye from his altercation in the city of joy yesterday
the air is filled with the muffled sounds of the street
from here we can see the evermore enfeebled godfather in his throne room wrapped in a cashmere listening to the radio
ashoka looks up stares impassively at someone
what have you got to say
for the first time we see who ashokas speaking to
i told them that your father provides us with a great deal and that ashoka slams his hand on the register
from this minute you are off the list
you will leave your rickshaw here
where it will be reserved for a man who deserves our trust
he stands up
hasari is near tears
please babu this is as if the ground has opened up
i have to speak to mr
hasari starts for the house
the goonda stops him and quickly has hasari on his knees his arm twisted pain fully behind his back
ashoka jumps at hasari grabs his ear
my fathers ill
you are speaking to me
i have a family
the decision is made
i have made it
now get out before i have mr
bhose break your legs
he gives hasaris ear a vicious twist and slams his head against the table
the side gate opens and hasari is shoved out
stumbling he runs to the fence peers through
two men are pulling his rickshaw into the courtyard
hasari watches as a steel shutter is pulled down cutting his livelihood from sight
numb compromised defeated
perhaps the low point of his life
flickering candlelight illuminates the raft of medusa
max rails at joan
i just dont
i dont want to
i dont want to care
i dont want to care this much
i just dont want to be invested in you people
i became a goddamn doctor because my goddamn father wanted me to be a goddamn doctor because he was a goddamn doctor
he was the goddamn king of doctors
its too goddamn hard
out of breath out of words joan reaches out and takes max to her brings him beside her on the cot
beneath the raft of medusa she sits with an arm around max as if he were her son
not everyones cut out for this
you did the best you could
better than many
its all right
i didnt do the best i could
i did what i always do
i shot my big mouth off and did a half assed job
and what i want to do now is i want to go back to america and make money and live a life without entanglements and demands and people hanging on
a beat you know the fact is from the minute were born were shipwrecked
some see that as a lifetime of drowning of fear others only to endure but to triumph
its all in the individual spirit isnt it
got it to run to spectate to commit
raises his hand running spectator
then by all means go home max and go with my blessing and my eternal friendship
the candlelight flickers against them as they sit side by side
at the tea shop a group relive the days events
the children sleep
aloka sits outside worried about hasari
max comes out meets alokas eyes and looks away
shes heard the conversation
hasari drunk comes down the slope
face to face with max
they took away my rickshaw
alokas hand flies to her mouth
hasari peers at max with his drunken gaze
its a terrible moment for max but
so what do you want me to do about it get it back for you
max takes away a step
im going home
because this isnt my fight
i got one person to look after me
hasari stares at max
on the roof the children listen
at the tea shop the late night talkers listen
all right im running out okay
because im a coward this is me this is what i do i get in over my head i let people down i run
but i trusted you
well that was your goddamn mistake
max walks away leaving hasari desolate
aloka comes to him
i dont know how im going to pay the rent how were going to eat
we have what is saved for amritas dowry
the thought of using the dowry is yet another awful blow to hasaris hopes
the children must leave the school theyll have to work
and you will not have anything to do with the clinic or those people anymore
ram joins them
what i earn is yours too
you cant support all of us
you have a family in your village too
hasari touches his friend and goes into alone in his pain he spots his tea caddy in which he planted his seeds over a month ago
he bends over to tenderly touch the growing shoot and water the earth
he looks up and the three children are staring at him
what will their father do now to keep them alive
the needle injected hasaris blood flowing into a bottle
hasari seated on the stool watching his blood leave his body his face again broken out in perspiration
his face immobile his thoughts distant
the attendant starts to pull the needle out
hasari stops his hand
the attendant shakes his head
the attendant looks at rafik who shrugs nods
and allows the blood to flow on out of hasaris body
barely ambulatory hasari starts down the street but has to stop lean against a wall
through his woozy haze he thinks he sees an apparition
there in the entrance to a building is gangooly
seeing a potential victim he swoops in
not well brother
still stealing from refugees
gangooly looks at hasari recognizes him and gives him an amazing smile
well yes i remember you of course hello
i am delighted to see you yes
and tell me immediately please your little family your beautiful children everyone eats yes
come have a cup of tea or a little something stronger we must celebrate
gangooly starts to move to position himself for a get away
hasari blocks his egress unsmiling
ah well youre angry at me yes i wondered if that was still on your mind i am full of regret about that yes even a little tormented
what can i say
i have the spirit of an eagle trapped in the body of a crow
my friend i am lame and i am poor
does that mean that i shouldnt survive
when a man is struggling in a rough sea he clutches onto what he can or he drowns
you dont look so well
i lost my rickshaw
gangooly gives hasari an appraising look for a moment then
i have an offer
shiva be my witness you must at least think about this
please i can help
or my name is not mr
which fortunately it is
gangooly guiding hasari onward
remove the children from the school no why
when you the father can make a small sacrifice
nature has foreseen your plight
for she has given you two eyes yes and two kidneys
to live you have need of one only
i have a friend who sold his kidney this one and now believe me this is the truth he lives in a brick home
which he owns
a forbidding face appears at the grill stares out
hasari and gangooly enter
a repulsive smell almost makes hasari gag
gangooly takes hasaris arm and steers him through the gloom
hasari discovers the origin of the smell
a line of skeletons arranged along the walls
tables stacked with bones skulls spines rib cages hands and feet
each skeleton sports a label with a price in u
crouched among the bones and packing crates are men work ing
some smoke some have masks over their faces
they scrape and clean and decorticate
they skillfully assemble their grisly creations emotionless but like artists
through a dusty glass interior window we see almost in mime the manager examining hasari
with a smile the manager produces some papers
hasari shakes his head starts for the door
gangooly stops him
of course take some time think about it
people all over the world anxiously waiting willing to pay
rupees for a kidney
for an eye
gangooly winks peers at hasari with a single eye and smiles
heat haze on the road
as we focus we find max joan aloka also with their thoughts
joan gazes out the window of the taxi
max looks at the back of joans head a moment then looks at aloka who sits between them
she deflects his eyes forward
hasari has forbid her to have anything more to do with us
hed be very angry if he knew she was seeing you off
max looks at joan
looks out the window
first we see joyous people greeting arriving passengers parents greet a young man returning from college abroad
the way clears and we close in on max joan and aloka a tiny island in this sea of people at the moment of their parting
max empties all the money out of his pockets
this is for poomina
when i get home
he thrusts the money on joan and max offers his hand she goes through the hand to embrace max
then max and aloka look at each other
you did good things
chokes up but manages thank you for coming to our country
and now max heads out the door
they sit in isolation at a table over a cup of tea
its not like hes royalty or anything so im not persuaded we have to wait for the plane to actually take off
we should go
yet they remain another moment
then get up
joan puts her arm around aloka and they turn to go
the looks on their faces suggest theyve come face to face with something startling
standing inside the departure doorway
what were those three choices again
and his with just a wistful version of his old grin
and we hasari returns
goes into rams hut
he finds his family
the two men stare at each other
i need aloka at the clinic
as hasari stares all right they the patients need her
shes a good nurse
as hasari stares come on man this is between you and me
why take the kids out of school why punish your wife
hasari holds his anger in he moves to a mat and lies down his back to max
but max doesnt go
i have a little money i can get it from the states
its not a question of money
well survive on our own
hasari lies with his back to max
after some moments of silence aloka indicates max should go
and he does
after another moment
maybe hes right
the clinic is for everyone and if i am needed hasari bolts up a look of anger on his face weve never seen
im your husband and youll do as i say
unless of course youve become an american wife and then youll do as you please
stay away from them
they are not part of us
they will only be good to you as long as you please them
the children aloka are frozen she very close to tears
hasari lies back down again turns his back on them
the small colony alive a line of patients outside a door
max unwraps a bandage from a lepers partial limb
looks around for aloka
shes not there
said is acting as his nurse
points at his instruments
hand me the scissors please
helpfully said hands him the tweezers
said fumbles through the instruments picking up the scissors by the ends
not that end no thats fine thanks ive got it
max comes out with his last patient
max daddah you are finished
max nods follow me
anouar takes off down the lane and disappears quickly into a little building max following
max follows anouar past bubbling cauldrons and heaps of animal skins
the place stinks fiercely
anouar and max exit into
two young men the two pullers chomotkar and ramatullah and something covered with a tarp
you didnt steal this
the police sahib they stole it
we stole it from them
the pullers whip the tarp off
a battered rickshaw the springs poking out of the seat the broken wheels lying in the body the finish scarred and gouged one shaft broken
max comes into the square
aloka and selima are pre paring meals
manooj shambu and three other boys playing
ram is trying to jolly hasari whos deep in his own reverie
max stands in front of hasari
id like to show you something
just take a minute
a beat as hasari fixes max with an empty stare and the family waits to see if hasari will respond
the sound of a padlock being unlocked
max and hasari appear in the doorway
surprised by the light a few rats scurry off
some where a dog barks
slated shafted light
he indicates a corner
piled up in its ruin
im good with my hands
youre good with yours
what do you say
hasari looks at max part resentful part touched
if i were to go on the street with this machine i would end up in a gutter with my throat cut
well its yours if you want it
you know the license the cops all that can be fixed
youll own this itll have nothing to do with the godfather
doctor daddah im just a small man
dont try to tempt me again with big thoughts
hasari starts to leave
max blocks his way
you didnt want me to quit
well i came back
but can you be trusted
i hope so
hasari can see the hope and desire in maxs face
after a moment max steps aside
hasari bends his head and makes off
leaving max and a small sigh of disappointment
she takes her morning absolutions bathing in the foun tain
the process is extremely sensual though there is not even a glimpse of her nakedness as she moves her clothing around cleansing this area then that
she glances up to see
max in an indian shirt heading for the square rather naturally he brings his hands together in the indian salutation
he carries several bottles of distilled water a large value pack of bar soap and a carton of medical supplies
as he passes his eyes hook on alokas
he lifts a hand in greeting
after a moment she ducks her head
he turns and continues on coming face to face with ram an enormous smile on his face
with him hasari
he glances at his wife in the water
to hasari going to look for work
when hasari doesnt answer
yes he is
ram has a small coughing fit
are you taking your medicine
yes yes but look at this
he points at the wheel of his rickshaw the rim is cracked
scornfully hasari walks on
max and ram glance after him
max digs out several rupees
ram takes them and goes
max looks after the two men as they disappear
when he turns
he finds himself face to face with aloka
without a word they start walking side by side toward the square
its several seconds before she says
hes very proud
they walk on in silence two friends separated by a gulf
men moving like ants into the bow of the ship
hasari is locked out turned away without work
a huge gouge in the black mud sunlight streaming through steel girders across it
hasari emerges from the ground looking for someone
the foreman shakes his head no before hasari even has the chance to ask for work
then we see hes standing outside mitra co
staring at it wondering if its time to sell part of himself
we see on his face a look that tells us he will not be beaten
the street childrens school now takes up two rooms
children peer out of one room now as to the accompani ment of suryas zither twenty or so girls are doing some indian classical dancing under the eye of a
young indian teacher
across the way in the other room some children are translating bengali words into english
a boy is writing on the board
we see that shambu is in the same class
from behind we watch max take a wrapping off of poominas wound joan assisting him
indeed ashoka extended poominas smile on either side of her mouth
the scars are healing as nicely as could be expected
max did a fine job
you must have had a good doctor
still no running jumping picking up anything heavy
and you stay here
youre going to help sister joan and youre going to school
do you understand
a beat poomina nods
but now a look of abject fear comes over her face
the goonda stands in the doorway
max begins singing sweet little sixteen
the goodna stares impassively at max
time to collect the rent sister
come with me please
joan leaves followed by the goonda
max works care fully at the fine line of scabbing on poominas scar
but then something takes his attention
manooj with a small tin of food looks this way and that
and then sneaks into the shed
we hear a tap tap tap
the door is half open
the padlock is hanging on its chain
max opens the door
startled frightened hasari presses himself against the wall as does manooj
hasari is wearing a wet dhoti caught in the middle of straightening the wheel rim of the old rickshaw
close the door
max is very surprised but needless to say pleased
he looks at the rickshaw looks at hasari
close the door
the godfather has more eyes than a pineapple
max quickly closes the door
the half light is broken by thin beams of light that dance with dust
hasari studies max a moment then moves to put the first wheel on
instinctively manooj moves to his side takes hold of the rickshaw so hasari can slip the wheel on
hasari nods and goes for the other wheel
manooj moves around to the other side hefts the carcass
hasari slips on the second wheel
hasari looks at max
max brings his hands together and starts to go
i was saying to manooj that if a man bows down too many times there will come a day when he will no longer be able to stand upright
the two men look at each other
and then hasari gets on with his work
i promised manooj and shambu id take them to the movies
is it all right
a beat if a man makes a promise
max brins his hands together and starts for the door
hasari picks up one of the worn seat boards
were tracking with a moving bag of peanuts behind a row of boys heads
on the screen in front of them a medi eval era sword battle between the great kumar kapur and a legion of bad guys
we hear the sound of cracking nuts as we move from manooj to three kids weve seen in the neighborhood two boys manoojs age and shoba whos shambus age and
then to shambu each kid dipping into the bag in his turn
finally maxs and on the other side of him amrita and poomina
the bag arrives
whispering thanks guys
who wants to go for more peanuts
were talking about rapt attention
we hear nuts cracking
max and the boys walking home after the movie the boys dancing around each other acting out the fight sequences all of the sword fighting against max who battles them
all over the street in and around cars poomina and amrita looking on shyly as el max fights to save their honor
i cant decide if i want to be kumar kapur or a doctor
you can be both
manooj pal swashbuckling physician
youre so much fun el max
i wish my daddy were as much fun as you
max stops the fight takes manooj by the shoulders
i wish my father loved me like your father loves you
your dads a very special man
and now en garde
as the battle continues the bright beams of a truck come at them
time out men
off the street till this truck passes
the kids move toward the wall of the building theyre passing but the truck seems to turn toward them seem ing not to intend to pass but to hit them
the look on maxs face lets us know he senses something terrible is in the offing here
he shouts for the kids to get out of the way shoving the kids closest to him into a doorway
he turns to shambu whos behind him calls to him
but in a panic shambu doesnt move into the shelter of the building on his right
but tries to run across the street
max leaps for the little boy too late
as the truck just misses max and clips shambu hard sending the little boy flying
manooj runs ahead of everyone as he charges into rams hut crying for his father
behind manooj come the others max carrying shambu in his arms
hasari and aloka ram joan others in the square hurtle out of their huts
i cant do anything here
hes got a compound fracture he hemorrhaging
weve got to get to a hospital now
youll never get a taxi at this hour
he pounds along the wheels wobbling and squeaking urging people out of his way
max runs alongside hasari
aloka sits on the seat with shambu whose quiet moaning fills her ears
blood drips down the rickshaw
several taxis waiting for clients outside a row of restaurants
hasari and aloka watch as max argues with the drivers
they wont take a bleeding passenger
the race to the hospital continues
the arrive at the gates of the huge victorian hospital
people sleep outside the gates
the wards are full as are the corridors
patients on beds and stretchers everywhere
most have at least one member of their family to look over them
in a side room max is arguing with a porter who tells him he cant help him
max slaps some rupees into the porters hand tells him to take him to the person in charge
shambu is fading
aloka smooths the sweat from his brow trying to keep shambu alive by force of will and love
then max is back standing over her with another man
it may take a moment before we recognize the attendant from the blood bank
theyll admit him but we have to pay for the blood
i gave him all i had
he wants more
do you have anything
sister joan gave me this
aloka holds out a fistful of rupees
the attendant blows through his lips indicating its a paltry sum
max grabs the money and shoves it at the attendant
we havent got any more
the attendant doesnt move
until he sees max is about to explode
if this child dies while you stand here ill kill you
the attendant is smart enough not to push any further
now i need an x ray room and i need an o
you cant give care youre an american
you must be an indian doctor
then take me to one
as max takes flight with the attendant aloka strokes shambu and hasari hovers
we close in on shambus inanimate face and hold a moment
max hurtles down the corridor with a young intern in tow
almost a kid hes been up for days
but hes going to help
this way please
max scoops shambu up and rushes down the corridor behind the intern leaving hasari and aloka looking after him
his arm comes around her shoulders
hasari and aloka wait
people are starting to move about
youre my wife aloka you and my children are all my wealth
but if max daddah and big sister joan have need of you you may go to them
max comes out of the hospital
the two pals stare at him
we pinned his leg
couple of months hell be better than ever
they want to keep him today
were a good team
he smiles holds out a palm for them to slap
they look at the palm unsure what this means
yet each takes maxs hand
the whole community is here around the tree
i dont think it was an accident
i think they were aiming for max
so what we have to ask ourselves is whether his presence is endangering all of us
even from my low vantage point i know this its the son
max daddah is our friend
if theyre trying to harm him then theyre trying to harm all of us
we must stand by him as one
dip into a little box of paints
the boys look on as the two men paint an intricate design on the shafts
shambu sits in the rickshaw seat
he wears an ankle to hip cast
manooj is spelling words and urging shambu to follow suit
aloka is putting out a tray of food
ram ramatullah and chomotkar slip in quickly close the door
the two pullers focus on the rickshaw ram on max
doctor daddah please very important only one moment
this is going to cost me every rupee i didnt make today
ram thrusts an envelope into maxs hand
a letter from your wife
ram nods nervously
max looks at the postmark as he slices it open with a finger
this is postmarked six weeks ago
so what have you been doing incubating it
i was afraid
ram waits his hands twisting each other
my dear husband
oh thats very hopeful so far
your words brought tears of joy to my arid eyes
oh im in love
my words brought tears to her arid eyes
then fearful what does that mean arid
manooj throws his hand up
her eyes were dry your letter irrigated them
he snatches the letter crushes it to his heart
notices the finish work on the rickshaw
this is a puka nasgar
what a curse that you cant use it
im going on the streets tomorrow
this gets everyones attention
the pullers shake their heads theyre worried for him
i dont want you to think im crazy but i dont think that truck was an accident
i think ashoka was after me
you can bet hell be after you too
im going to speak to his father
can i go with you
ill go with you
can i go with you if i shut up
and hasari gives him a small nod
ghatak is literally carried out of the house by an orderly and placed into his car
theres a driver and there is the goonda
they start down the street
were with the car
suddenly the driver slams on the brakes and from we see hasari and max blocking the street with the new rickshaw
the goonda jumps out of the car comes threateningly at hasari
babu please i beg you hear my words
as the goonda is about to land on hasari we hear a feeble
the goonda backs off
the godfather waves hasari and max close
hasari brings his gleaming rickshaw to the window of the car max at his shoulder
may i say first babu i wish you long life and good health
they take me now to the scientists
they stick needles in me take pictures of my insides study them and then tell me what i know
the godfather stares at hasari flicks his eyes at max
when you gave me work i swore i would be as your youngest brother
your son thinks i have been disloyal
he took my rickshaw
with my friend i have remade this one
i beg you to let me go again onto the streets
i have my family
the old man looks at the rickshaw at the obvious care that went into its renovation at this unlikely team of refurbishers
he reaches a shaking hand out toward a shaft
hasari brings it close
the old man rubs the shaft
it is very beautiful
thank you babu
if i may say it has an allure
an allure babu thank you
the godfather stares at hasari then at max
the world is chaos
we struggle to build something permanent then our bodies betray us our sons betray us
to hasari now yes you may take your rickshaw out
if you can face up to my son
the goonda gets back into the car and the car pulls away and we are left with hasari and max as moment
the manager stares at hasari as he consumes a pot of rice and vegetable curry
gangooly hovers like a crow
hasari stares at the contract before him
if a man dies and hes not burned what do you think becomes of his soul
the manager turns his palms up continues chewing
hasari stares through the window at the row of skeletons
i must provide for my family
oh its a noble fate
if indeed your wheel ceases to turn you will help educate somewhere in this great world a fine doctor
hasari bends to the contract and laboriously signs his name
hasari arrives to an outcry of anger
there are several dozen rickshaws
among the passersby we see umbrellas as the people on the street try to combat the incredible heat
whats going on
the godfather ill
the son is raising the rent
ashoka is on his front steps with a loudspeaker before a growing crowd of pullers
hes backed up by the goonda and a dozen of his thugs
the loudspeaker lifts ashokas voice above the anger
do you know how much it costs to change the spoke in a wheel
or how much baksheesh i have to pay the police
impulsively hasari moves forward
cries from pullers who will be the victims of this madness
you dont need the six rupees each old crate brings you per day to fill your belly
for us it means death
the street is so packed with rickshaw and pullers now that cars cant get through
a chorus of horns honk drivers scream
we havent been breaking our backs between the shafts of our rickshaws in order to weep for you
hasari continues forward his eyes on ashoka
the only thing that matters is the bundle of rupees we take to the munshi each month to feed and to answer the daily needs of our children
rassoul steps up on a telagarhi with a loudspeaker
listn to me
listen to me
when the pullers quiet friends
i ask you to vote for an unlimited strike
long live the revolution
rickshaw workers union zindabad
no income at all
the slogan is taken up by a small percentage of the assemblage
fear and doubt on many faces
thats what i thought
all right get to work
customers are waiting
something detonates in him and he jumps onto the tela garhi and grabs the microphone from ashoka
police arrive in vans
the godfather at least is a caring man
this one though the son a signal from ashoka and one of the thugs knocks hasari down
we helped this man
we gave him a job a place to live
this is how he shows his gratitude
get on the streets now
or turn in your machines
hasari gets up and tries to speak
if we stand he gets hit again
a number of the pullers come forward and a riot starts
the police move in beat and arrest many of the demonstrators
ramatullah and chomotkar try to help hasari but they are descended on by cops who hurl them aside and beat hasari senseless until the birds flying below ceiling
the room has a barred cage running all around its edge the cage is filled to near overflowing
hasari stands before the judge his face covered with blood his body a mass of aches and welts
at the back of the room max and aloka elsewhere ashoka the goonda and several of his thugs
the life of a rickshaw puller is not one a man would choose if he had a choice
our feet blister and burn up from the boiling asphalt our noses burn from the fumes of countless motor cars and buses our backs curve permanently from the loads we
carry hour after hour day after day
but i am proud to be one of the human horses who carry my countryman from place to place and i am thankful for the opportunity to make a living
but i will not keep silent anymore and i will not be cheated and threatened anymore
life is hard enough
ramatullah starts to applaud
rassoul follows suit
the judge bangs his gavel
when its silent this man will be permitted to use his rickshaw without let or hindrance
and i will make a restraining order against mr
cheers from the pullers
the judge bangs his gavel
i havent finished these proceedings
for his part in this disturbance i fine the defendant rupees
fifty rupees your honor
thats pay at this time or spend seven days in jail
seven days in jail will cost him far more than fifty rupees
as he reaches into his pocket for his screw of money a hand suddenly protrudes into the cage through the bars
and now another hand with several rupees reaches through
now a dozen voices call his name and a dozen hands reach through the bars with rupees clutched in their fists and press the money into hasaris hands
the judge max and aloka and certainly ashoka watch this in amazement
the judge bangs his gavel
max turns shoots a little finger gun and winks at ashoka
on his face we see pure hatred for these two men
amrita manooj and shambu
with them subash flirting with amrita incurring the wrath and admiration of her brothers causing her to flush
they all look up
rain starts to fall
people run outside of workshops and huts crying the rains the rains
suddenly a thunderclap shakes the earth and rain begins to bombard them
the rain falls the wind howls and people in the lane are dancing praising the beginning of the monsoon season
men tear off their shirts women rush out fully clothed singing
swarms of naked children run about
the kids run toward the clinic school
hasari is locking his rickshaw into the shed
staff and several patients come out of the examining rooms joan aloka sunil anouar poomina
margareta and her students a new teacher bandona her students come out of the classrooms
theyre all swept up in dancing joans metal cross jumping about as if it were beating out time
from his balcony max emerges with his trumpet and plays the first bars of singin in the rain
everyone looks his way he begins to hum and sing as he jumps over the balcony to the ground and takes off in a wild impro vished but damn good
version of gene kellys dance in the rain bringing anouar on his cart in as his dancing partner
everyone in the courtyard crowds around them laughing and encouraging the dancer singers on
the number builds to an extraordinary climax with max sliding through mud to an exquisite finish at joans feet
theres thunderous applause
max the pals ram joan anouar meeta and the baby poomina saladdin mehboub ashish shanta margareta bandona and the other members of the commit tee sharing a meal
really a boyfriend amrita
amrita whacks manooj
yes she does
his name is subash ghosh
his father owns the workshop
is there someone you care about
the look in amritas eyes tells us indeed there is
hasari smiles at amrita and then at aloka
then i must speak to his father and i must complete your dowry
amrita squeezes close to her mother
this is serious and joyous
you will make people sigh at how beautiful you are
and i shall drop tears of joy
at my wedding i became so frightened my father gave me things to drink to calm me down
i went out to piss and fell asleep under the village tree
when i woke i thought it was the tree id married
i still love that tree
but hasaris attention is on his daughter
he reaches a loving hand to her
a rag has been wrapped around the faucet and water runs slowly and silently down into the nearly filled tub
the scene is illuminated dimly by a flashlight with fingers over the beam
suddenly hes grabbed his eyes spring open in fear
hands yanks him out of bed slam him up against the wall then hurtle him across the room and into where the tub has been filled
his head is slammed down underwater and hes held there struggling
his head is yanked up and through bleary eyes he sees a knife at his throat and the hewbrew letter chai dangling from the knife wielders neck illuminated by a
go home doctor
before he can respond hes slammed down into the tub of water again and held there until it seems his lungs will explode
then hes dumped backward gasping for breath
max on the run through the rain carrying his belongings
he pounds through the puddles past a sleepy old watchman and through the gate
he bangs on joans door
she opens the door in her indian pajamas
one look at him
ashoka ordered me to go home
well ive come home
she steps aside he steps in and the door closes him safely inside
the rickshaw station
the rain pours down
people clambor for rickshaws
the line moves forward as fast as the pullers can take on passengers
hasari ram ramatullah chomotkar look at the stalled buses the streetcars the taxis the private cars
what a joy it is to survey this disaster
we will all make a fortune
the monsoon is the great durgas gift to the human horse
hasari glances at ram who isnt a part of the joking
whats the matter
im wet and im cold
your daughter is getting married
time is passing
i want to go home to my wife
chomotkar touches hasari nods across the street
there we see the goonda and two thugs
its hasaris turn
he cant stay to talk with ram now
he has to go
how much to the market
i wont pay it
who else needs a ride
i am available at a price
several others crowd and shove toward him
take me ill pay lets go
the price just went up
the marwari hesitates only as long as it takes him to dig in his soaking wet pants and to slap the bills into hasaris hand and climb aboard
hasari sets out with great difficulty and greater determination through the floodwaters flicking his eyes at the goonda as he goes
water pours down
from here we see hasari inside putting money down in front of the shop owner and then hustling back into the rain and taking up his shafts
we watch the owner look after him with a touch of disdain as he comes into the window and takes down the beautiful green and gold sari
water pouring from above the gutters overflow with refuse
we pan up to the clinic
water pouring off the room into the courtyard
hasari locks his rickshaw into the shed and turns out attention to max aloka joan poomina margareta mehboub several others trying to patch leaking roof tiles and keep supplies high
max looks at him doesnt like the look of the obviously exhausted man
how can i help
an anglo couple jockeying for preference
hasari selects them from a crowd
this is the beginning of running a he runs at us from different directions with riders pushing pushing the water getting higher our focus variously in normal and slow motion
on his feet his tensed muscles for a moment we hear only his breathing the sound of his feet on the pavement the rain against the canopy of the rickshaw
b he drags up with an entire well to do family of six packed into the rickshaw
c he stumbles to a stop outside the emergency entrance to the hospital carrying a mother and her sick child
d an upper crust brahmin dressed in crisp white an umbrella protecting him against the harsh elements
e four uniformed school children huddled laughing together under the rickshaws canopy
the rain continues as does the work in the clinic
max is working on anouar aloka assisting
meeta and the baby now months old in the b
i think aloka would have a gentler touch than you max daddah
maybe she should perform this surgery on her own
aloka ducks her eyes embarrassed
last time you told me you were more than two women could manage
yes but given a choice between one and none i will accept the one
max lifts anouar off the table and places him on his cart
okay you ought to be good for another few days
send in the next patient
anouar scoots out
max and aloka both turn to the instruments lying on the table and knock a pair of scissors to the floor
simultaneously they bend to pick it up and bang heads
the first impulse of each is to touch the others head
but almost simultaneously their hands freeze short of touching
several months ago max might have tried to kiss her now though there is friendship and affection
from here we see a pair of bare feet
we come with max and aloka up
shoba a deeply concerned look on his face
slowly his hands come forward holding his parrot with a broken wing
he puts the parrot on the examining table
hasari seals a letter and a money order into an envelope seals and puts it into the slot
he is clearly exhausted
outside he can see two sikh merchants at his rickshaw looking around in the rain for him
he hurries toward the door
aloka and three women huddled beside a window amrita half hidden behind them
we pan across a staircase to another window through which we see a doorway
in the doorway subash turns to smile a shy smile at amrita he shrugs
past him now we see hasari facing subashs father and three uncles surly men with hair matted with mustard oil
the ghoshes are all seated on low chairs and stools
hasari is standing
ghosh and the uncles stare at hasari who stands politely and hopefully before them
youre a rickshaw puller am i correct
yes thats correct
he looks at his brothers on either side
they look at him
and i a partner in the workshop where your daughter is employed
were you aware of that
yes yes i was my daughter told me thank you
yes well then perhaps you can tell me why i would permit my son to marry your daughter
ghosh raises his palms
its all over as far as hes concerned
just a moment please
the brothers huddle whisper just loudly enough for hasari to hear
are you saying theres no way youd consider this match
ghosh shakes his head shrugs his palms
perhaps some inducement
would that be of any help
considering this what could he possibly offer
but perhaps in fairness we should find out
the huddle breaks
all five men stare at hasari
hasari mouth half open flecked with spume pulls a huge marwari
hes pouring sweat his eyes are blood shot
he has never looked more like a horse
they arrive at a cross street
the marwari gets down and pays hasari
hasari slumps against the rickshaw and while he awaits his next rider counts his crum pled pile of notes and coins
max joan aristotle john margareta mehboub perhaps a dozen others trying to raise the level of the low wall at the entrance with bricks
the wall caves in
other people in the neighborhood rush to rebuild it
shouting to the others my dear friends its just occurred to me what inspired me to stay here
thinking hes about to make some cogent remark about this unified effort
whats that doctor big brother
the opportunity to acquire waterfront property at a reasonable price
joan begins to laugh the others dont get it query each other as to whats funny about that
i hate to admit it junior but that was actually quite witty
she whacks him on the shoulder with a wet muddy paw
ut nobody laugh its a natural disaster we have guests
everyone turns to
manubai and ravi their car parked at the entryway to the clinic
a big puddle separates them
id throw my cape down but im all out of dry capes
he sloshes through the water to them wiping his muddy hands on his pants
he offers a semi clean hand to each in turn
its very nice to see you
both of you
we heard you were still here
vijay wanted to send some things
she indicates the car which is packed with dry food and such
shall we unload the car
yes yes by all means
max whistles indicates the car
people come and start unloading it ravi showing the way leaving max and manubai alone a moment aloka flicking her eyes at the two of them
i really didnt think youd stick it out
people grow older sometimes they even grow up
he smiles a sweet smile at her
she smiles back at him
anouar on saids shoulders
the big mute runs followed by hasari and a phalanx of rickshaw pullers chomotkar rassoul ramatullah joan aloka manooj several others in the rickshaws max and sunil each with his
doctor bag all of them running in silhouette along the embankment in the rain
where can we take them
we cant take them back to the clinic
no one will put up with it
we cant let them drown can we
eh max daddah
the leper colony is submerged
the parents have put their children on the roofs and the relatively able bodied lepers are piling charpoys one on top of another to protect the sick and the infirm
meeta and her baby are on a roof
the mud bank is too slippery to get the rickshaws down and back up
its too deep
a leper clings to a rope as several of the human horses pull him and others up the mud bank
max hasari rassoul and chomotkar up to their necks in water hasari and rassoul have a door on their shoulders on top of the door a sick leper woman
max is lifting one child then another onto the door
the two pullers make their way slowly toward the mud bank
aloka joan helping lepers into rickshaw
the hut starts to come apart under them
max and chomotkar quickly move to the house with another door
chomotkar holds the door up as meeta holds the baby out in the direction of maxs voice
max catches the baby as the house slips down then grabs meeta who clings to him
hasari pulling the lead rickshaw
anouar on maxs shoulders the two of them leading a terrible ensemble version of hound dog
an air of festivity among lepers and rescuers
they come to a bridge made of two planks over rushing water
several rickshaws go across but as max and anouar start over suddenly the ground gives way beneath maxs feet
anouar falls free someone grabs him but a blackish stream rushes into maxs mouth and in an instant hes swept beneath the gurgling filth
the density of the filth makes his effort to surface ineffective
it looks for all the world like hes going to drown
max has disappeared
instinctively hasari dives into the maelstrom
he too disappears
after some moments hasari surfaces spitting the filth out of his mouth
he dives again comes up somewhere else
dives a third time
then suddenly bursts out of the filth dragging the unconscious form of max loeb into the air
more people have gathered
cries of its the doctor
save doctor big brother
aloka passes a baby to someone and helps hasari push max up onto the bank
but now hasari doesnt know what to do and turns to his wife
aloka quickly clears maxs mouth and begins to admin ister mouth to mouth resuscitation
she blows she breathes she blows she breathes
people crowd in
aloka blows she breathes
it seems though that by his stillness and by the looks on peoples faces that max is dead
yet more determined still aloka goes on blows breathes
and now max gags his body erupts in spasm and he explodes a stream of black liquid out of his lungs
aloka supports his forehead as max retches again and then comes still
we pan across members of our group lepers and normals passing bowls of rice in a simple communal meal singing a religious song quietly
on the floor in the b
anouar is writing something on a slightly damp stretch of cloth with a childs crayon
said takes the cloth and tacks it to the wall
what anouar has written is this all that is not given is lost
everyone in the room stares at the words
max opens his eyes to find joan hasari aloka and the children keeping a vigil
oh jesus the guy went to sleep when he was supposed to be working
i gotta get up he tries to get up
joan pushes him back down
sshh sshh sshh
no heroics junior
youre all right
a distant laugh yeah i am im all right
he is a little delirious
the boys come close kneel at his side instinctively reach out to him
want you guys to know something
wanted to be the worlds greatest heart surgeon just one better than my dad
first time im the lead surgeon on a case the main guy i choke
the chief made me step aside
had to take over for me
went into radiology
had to have somethin easy
wasnt too nuts about myself
hasari reaches out and touches max telling him with a touch that its all right
he stares up through bleary eyes at all of them with utterly open love
amrita holds out a small gift to him its a banana leaf holding a small scoop of rice and surrounded by little decorative leaves
a beat i love you guys
a group gathered on a dry sunny afternoon peering into the hut
we focus on the growing flower in the tea caddy in the window and then go through the window into
hasari max dressed quite india the local hara giri mr
ghosh and the four ghosh uncles crammed into the tiny room
members of our group jam the doorway spectating
the air is close
i can offer no more than ive offered
all right ill add two dhotis two vests and a punjabi
but thats all
ghosh lights up a bidi looks at his brothers wrinkles his brows at hasari
did he say thats all
my daughters qualities will make up for what is lacking
well it wont do
i am firm in requiring for my exceptional son the bicycle repees
and one ounce of gold
the child of a rajah might be worth that and im not even sure of that
we linger on shambu a moment
sister cecilia in full habit looks over a sheaf of test scores
then she peers up at
manooj seated between hasari and max
well indeed i think sister joan is right weve got a prospect here
well start you off with a few classes if that works out well make a proper student of you
hasari cant believe his ears
manooj sits frozen
amrita subash and shambu heading home from the work shop
shambus cast is gone
subash flirts with amrita
they see hasari max and manooj coming toward them
manooj runs to them shouting that hes going to the school amrita subash shambu congratulate him
suddenly the rickshaw wheels jam
they turn to find two men one of whom has slammed a stick into hasaris spokes
retribution it would seem has arrived
the kids stop huddle instinctively together in fear
our policeman disappears into a doorway as shutters close up and down this little street
there are thugs at both ends
no one else is visible on the street
the two men stare at hasari a moment smiling
then one gets into the rickshaw crosses his legs as if he might want transport
but now he whips out a narrow bladed knife and still staring at hasari begins to slice up the newly covered seats of the rickshaw
max looks around trying to cool things
hey come on dont do this
well whats the problem here
they turn ashoka
behind him the goonda
youve become very brave of late havent you
dont do this
oh i do what i please
you see my fathers dead im in charge now
so you will get off my streets you will leave my country and that clinic and school will close
my father was weak
he let you and your european friend give these little people ideas
you cant do this
he takes no more than a step at ashoka a hand coming up when hes hit hard from behind
goes to his knees
his hand comes away from the back of his head with blood
he tries to rise and is hit again
to the kids get back
no no come forward
ashoka glides toward the petrified amrita
the goonda remains unmoving watchful
ashoka puts out his hand with its rings and strokes amritas cheek
what a little woman already hey
please dont touch her babu
what did you say
i said please dont touch her
hasari glances over his shoulder his eyes bouncing off the goondas impassive face
now the knife comes out of ashokas pocket snaps open glints in the light
shes going to give someone a lot of enjoyment
theres a moment of unbearable tension as everyone in cluding the goonda realizes this man is out of control
to the goonda he said please didnt he
please dont touch her
the goonda stares at ashoka
and now ashoka reaches out and we follow close on his hand as it moves ever so slowly through space to settle on amritas breast
and now hasari explodes
he hits ashoka
a hard punch to the chest
ashoka stumbles and falls to one knee
the two thugs make a move to come to his rescue
but a curious thing stops them the goondas arm outstretched across their path his eyes alerting them not to proceed
max lurches to his feet unsteadily
bhose help me
hasari unloads a punch into ashokas face ashokas nose pours blood he starts to whimper
he clutches hasari hard to him
hasari struggles slams his palm into ashokas chin sending ashoka to the ground sending the knife skidding across the ground
hasari grabs the knife straddles ashoka about to kill
but he cant do it
life is hard enough
leave us alone
hasari backs off leans against a wall stares down at ashoka his hands in tight against his body
manooj and shambu stare at their father in awe
shambu sees something on the ground where the first blow was delivered to ashokas chest
everyone has moved slightly to one side
he bends and closes his fist around something
the goonda steps between ashoka and max and hasari
you wont be bothered again
a look from the goonda and the thugs vanish leaving ashoka cowering in a doorway on his knees
shutters start to open people begin to appear again in doorways and windows
fearing for his life ashoka suddenly bolts
max is fixed on hasari
he lets up a scream of exulta tion his hand going out for a five from hasari
the kids charge toward hasari
then everyone freezes
hasari lists to his right side and blood starts to pour from the knife wound in his abdomen under his pressing arm
from here we can see hasari on maxs cot under the raft of the medusa in the little room overlooking the street
out here the two doctors are alone
why dont you go on home
ill stay with him
max grips sunils hand strongly
sunil goes down the steps
max moves to hasaris bedside
he watches hasari breathing
he looks up at the raft of the medusa
a thin stream of dawn light coming through the half closed shutters
through the open door we can just see joan praying quietly
close around her anouar meeta surya marga reta poomina
beneath the raft of the medusa hasari pal speaks to his family and max aloka sitting close to the bed the children on the bed beside their father and max
a mans journey to the end of his obligations is a very long road
and you have to remember that you can never give up
we pray that life will bless us that we will be kings with possessions and money that we can rule over all around us
but its a mist the only thing that makes it possible to endure life is our love one for the other
a beat the family and max tightly bound together
and now we hear the dim sounds of rickshaw bells
i was dreaming the sound of rickshaw bells and now i hear them
max opens the windows
manooj helps his father sit up
outside there are rickshaw pullers filling the courtyard and spilling out into the street
when the window opens all the pullers start ringing their bells and the room is full of their music
are they here for me
unquestionably they are
a city so big
when we arrived we didnt have a place to live a friend
the many hands with their ringing bells
the tiny figure of shambu joins max in the window
max bends close
whispering is my father going to die
max makes the same sound he made in the ashram at the beginning of the movie though this sound of dismissal different
hasari mirrors maxs expression of dismissal
ive agreed to the bicycle ive agreed to the rupees
i can go no further
i have nothing more to give
everyone crowded around the door
from within we dimly hear the negotiations continue
max approaches from the clinic
shambu slips down the steps from above as
hows it going
all that stands between them now is the ounce of gold
max daddah joan di is she a good reader
what do you mean
she read this letter to me
he shows max but i think she must have read it wrong
she said my wife writes that irrigation has come to our village
but thats great
but it means i should go home to my wife
i thought thats why weve been writing all these letters
yes of course i love her from here yes but what if i go home and find i dont love her from there
shambu takes him by the hand and tugs him quickly to the edge of the tea shop
the little boy indicates max should bend close
max leans down
daddy needs gold right
and shambu brings his fist up from under the table
he opens his hand to disclose what he scooped off the ground during the fight maxs necklace and hebrew letter
do you think this is pretend gold or real
max stares at the little boys hopeful face
we see the fully blossomed flower in the tea caddy and then hasaris fingers come into the frame
he carefully snips the flower free of its stalk
amrita is dressed in the beautiful sari her father bought her
father and daughter are alone
he hands her the flower and adjusts her veil tenderly
you never did belong to me
you were only lent to me by god until you marry and continue the wheel of life
amrita stares at her loving father and slowly her arms come up around his neck the flower against his curved back
tears fill hasaris eyes but a smile graces his lips
the procession to the courtyard begins when a brass band strikes up accompanied by singing and shouting
tiny lights have been strung over the street
we see max and manubai
margareta and a group of children
joan with poomina
anour meeta said
everyone whos become part of the family is present
the procession arrives and enters
smoke from the chu las
light from a half dozen lamps
subash and his procession make their entrance
a ritual veil is fixed to subashs face
the pujari waves for hasari to come to his place
hasari turns to max
i would be pleased if you would stand with me in the place of honor to the right of my daughter
deeply touched max nods
and the two men step for ward
as subash is motioned forward by the pujari
subash sits beside amrita
the shyness of bride and groom as the ceremony proceeds with the winding of the red thread
hasari looks on with unspeakable pride max beside him
we see the faces of all our family again aloka manooj and shambu joan poomina surya selima aristotle john etc
as amrita and subash joined by the thread circle the flame
as we pull back and up
now we see the clinic and school and the surrounding area the alleys full of people and activity
