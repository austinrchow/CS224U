org activity of cars and taxis arriving and discharging passengers with luggage busy redcaps etcetera
we focus on a taxi pulling up and stopping the driver hands out modest looking luggage including a bunch of tennis rackets in cases to a redcap
camera pans down as the passenger gets out of the taxi so that we see only his shoes and the lower part of his trousers
he is wearing dark colored brogues and a conservative suit apparently
the feet move toward the entrance to the station and out of scene
immediately a chauffeur driven limousine drives up and an expensive place of airplane luggage is handed out of this and the passenger alighting from the back is seen to be
wearing black and white sport shoes which as before are all we see of him
the sport shoes start off in the wake of the brogues
camera follows the sport shoes and the brogues across the lobby into a passenger tunnel
there is the usual activity of passengers walking to and from a loud speaker announcing trains etc
as the brogues and the sport shoes emerge to the train platform camera pans them over to the steps of the train
the brogues and the sport shoes pass separately down the aisle the sport shoes turning in at a compartment door and the brogues continuing toward the parlor car
the brogues come to rest before a chair as the owner sits down
a moment later the sport shoes come to rest
before in adjoining chair
converted to pdf by www
the legs belonging to the sport shoes stretch out and one of the shoes touches one of the brogues
mans voice over scene oh excuse me
camera pulls back and up to show two young men seated in two parlor car chairs
brun anthony the wearer of the sport shoes is about twenty five
he wears his expensive clothes with the tweedy nonchalance of a young man who has always had the best
the wearer of the brogues is a fine looking but at the moment a somewhat troubled young man
this is guy haines
he too is in his middle twenties and is well dressed because he can now afford to be
he nods politely acknowledging brunos apology then turns away with the gesture implying he wants privacy
smiling with sudden recognition i beg your pardon but arent you guy haines
guy nods with a polite half smile
being a well known tournament tennis player he has had this sort of experience before
snapping his finger sure
i saw you blast faraday right off the court in south orange last season
what a backhand
made the semi finals didnt you
guy acknowledges this with a modest nod and turns to his magazine rolled up in is fist
with open admiration i certainly admire people who do things
smiling and introducing himself im bruno anthony
see guy looks up
bruno indicates his gold tie pin which bears his name in cut out letters
guy looks at it with the faintest expression of disdain
i suppose you think its corny
but my mother gave it to me so of course i wear it to please her
converted to pdf by www
patiently a faint smile how do you do
with an apologetic grin i dont usually talk so much
go ahead and read
guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of brunos open appraisal
it must be pretty exciting to be so important
fidgeting slightly a tennis player isnt so important
people who do things are important
i never seem to do anything
not knowing how to answer this guy looks a little embarrassed
still insistent on being friendly i suppose youre going to southampton for the doubles
politely you are a tennis fan
bruno is inordinately pleased by this small tribute
wish i could see you play
but ive got to be back in washington tomorrow
i live in arlington you know
he has taken out a cigarette case
holds it out to guy
converted to pdf by www
not now thanks

he fumbles for a match
guy brings out a lighter and hands it to bruno
he stares at the lighter impressed elegant
showing that it has the insignia of crossed rackets embossed on it and underneath is engraved the inscription to g from a
reading to g from a

guy reacts sharply

converted to pdf by www
even news about people i dont know

sharply perhaps you read too much
contritely there i go again
i meet someone i like and open my yap too wide
at the appeal on brunos face guy slowly relents
thats all right
i guess im pretty jumpy
bruno smiles with and signals a waiter
theres a new cure for that
to waiter scotch and plain water
to guy with a chuckle only kind of doubles i play
youll have to drink both of them
grinning and i can do it
moving in whens the wedding
you and anne burton
a gesture of explanation it was in the papers
it shouldnt have been
unless theyve legalized bigamy overnight
converted to pdf by www
i have a theory about that
id like to tell you about it some time
but right now i suppose divorce is still the simplest operation
the waiter has brought the drinks
bruno slips the lighter into hip pocket to free his hands for the bills which he gives to the waiter waving away the change
he offers a glass to guy
guy takes it
as if he needs it i guess i will
happily this is wonderful having your company all the way to new york
forced to explain as a matter of fact im not going direct
im stopping off
what would anybody want to go there for
its my home town
oh i get it
a little talk with your wife to about the divorce
i suppose she was the girl next door
held her hand in high school and before you knew it hooked
proud of his perspicacity am i right
laconically close enough
raises his glass well heres luck guy

converted to pdf by www

he hails a waiter who is passing through with a food laden tray do you know if there are any vacant seats in the dining car now

motions the waiter back say waiter bring me some lamb chops and french fries and chocolate ice cream compartment d car

the waiter is hovering impatiently
guy gives in out of embarrassment
well ill just have a hamburger and a cup of coffee
delighted lifts his glass in another toast to the next mrs
guy nods curtly

bruno and guy are finishing lunch
bruno has been drinking and his eyes are bright and feverish
an almost empty liquor bottle is near a couple of detective novels covered with gaudily illustrated dust jackets
bruno has in unlighted cigarette in his mouth
guys lighter is on the table
bruno snaps it a couple of times as though fascinated lights his cigarette and puts the lighter on the table again
sure i went to college
three of them
every time they kicked me out my father threw me back in
bitterly he finally gave up
he thinks im awfully small fry not worth the bait
wistfully you my friend guy
im your friend bruno
a little woozy no youre not nobody thinks im anything special
only my mother
empties the bottle into his glass my father hates me
guy smiles this off as nonsense
you must be imagining things
hitting the bottom of the bottle for the last drop and i hate him
he thinks i ought to catch the eight five bus every morning punch a timeclock and work my way up selling paint or something
him with all his money
amused by bruno well what do you want to do
you mean before or after i kill him
converted to pdf by www
chuckling before of course
leaning forward eagerly i want to do everything
i got a theory youre supposed to do everything before you die
have you ever driven a car blindfolded at a hundred and fifty miles an hour
i flew in a jet plans too
his hand traces a swift streak through the air and he adds sound effects zzzzzzzp
man thats a thrill
almost blow the sawdust out of my head
im going to make a reservation on the first rocket to the moon
amused and curious what are you trying prove
im not like you guy
marrying the bosss daughter is a nice short cut to a career isnt it
quickly marrying the senators daughter has nothing to do with it
cant a fellow look past a tennis not without being a goldbricker
take it easy boy
im your friend remember
id do anything for you
humoring bruno sure bruno sure
converted to pdf by www
glancing at his watch well be pulling in soon
ive got to change trains
whatd you say her name was your wifes
miriam joyce haines
played around a lot i suppose
lets not talk about it any more
almost hopefully maybe shell make more trouble for you
i dont think so
you mean you got enough on her to get your divorce no matter what
lets change subject bruno cant we
want me to tell you one of my ideas for murdering my father
indicating the detective novels youve been reading too many of these
going right on you want to hear about the busted light socket in the bathroom or the carbon monoxide in the garage
i may be old fashioned but i thought murder was against the law
converted to pdf by www
but not against the law of nature
my theory is that everybody is a potential murderer
didnt you ever want to kill somebody
say one of those useless fellows miriam was running around with
you cant go around killing people just because you think theyre useless
oh whats a life or two
some people are bitter off dead guy
take your wife and my father for instance
it reminds me of a wonderful idea had once
i used to put myself to sleep at night figuring it out
now lets say you want to get rid of your wife
lets say she refuses to give you a divorce raises a finger and stops guys protest lets say
youd be afraid to kill her because youd get caught
and what would trip you up
now heres the plan
im afraid i havent time to listen
ignoring the remark its so simple too
a couple of fellows meet accidentally like you and me
no connection between them at all
never saw each other before
each of them has somebody hed like to get rid of but he cant murder the person he wants to get rid of
hell get caught
so they swap murders
converted to pdf by www
each fellow does the other fellows murder
then there is nothing to connect them
the one who had the motive isnt there
each fellow murders a total stranger
like you do my murder and i do yours
with relief were coming into my station
for example your wife my father
with a smile we do talk the same language dont we guy
preparing to leave sure we talk the same language
thanks for the lunch
beaming im glad you enjoyed it
i thought the lamb chops were a little overdone myself
he holds out his hand
guy is in a hurry but he shakes hands
nice meeting you bruno
detaining him at the door you think my theory is okay guy
you like it
sure sure bruno
theyre all okay
he salutes a quick goodbye and hurries away converted to pdf by www
left alone bruno picks up guys lighter from the table starts to call guy back to hand it to him
then he looks closer at the insignia of crossed tennis rackets
smiling criss cross
as the train comes in
as guy gets off the with his suitcase and tennis rackets
a baggage man with baggage truck is passing
smiling guy haines
good to too you boy
you be sure to win at southampton tomorrow hear me
ive got two dollars on your nose
indicating his suitcase and rackets then park these in a lucky spot for a few hours will you
he loads them onto a truck
guy is walking up the main street
converted to pdf by www
typical music shop of a small town with plate glass windows and displays of radios records sheet music etc
activity of a couple of customers and salespeople inside
guy comes along the street and goes into the shop
as guy enters
there are the usual counters and shelves pianos and radios on display and the sound of a piano being tuned in the back of the store
miriam is finishing with a customer at a counter
hargreaves the manager is busy at the shelves
another girl clerk is serving a customer
in one of the glass cubicles where records are tried out a customer is playing symphonic music in a second glass cubicle another customer is listening to a record of
a third cubicle is empty
activity of the street is seen through the plate glass front
guy walks straight to miriam just as she is finishing with her woman customer handing over a small package
taking money from customer even change
thank you madam
she looks up at guy as the woman moves off well hello guy
youre looking well miriam
miriams face is pretty because it is still young
she is self centered and inclined to be vindictive
she wears harlequin glasses with myopic lenses which tend to make her eyes look small
so are you
youve got a nice tan playing tennis with all your rich friends
ignoring the remark what time do we meet your lawyer
sly little smile whats your hurry
converted to pdf by www
thats funny coming from you
youre the one whos in a hurry arent you
coyly when you wouldnt give me the divorce right away i sort of hoped it was because you were a little bit jealous
biting i got over being jealous a long time ago miriam
miriams eyes slide toward the other girl clerk who has moved closer within listening range
indicating empty glass cubicle lets talk in there
guy follows miriam across to the empty room
miriam has brought her purse along
once inside the sounds of the music playing from other parts of the shop are heard but very faintly
the piano tuning still goes on but less stridently
miriam and guy are cooped together in the close quarters
intimately now this is cosier
sort of like old times isnt it guy
coldly oh skip it miriam
its pretty late to start flirting with a discarded husband
especially when youre going to have another mans baby
do you know i think youre handsomer than ever
converted to pdf by www
lets see your lawyer and get this over with
did you bring the money guy
lawyers are expensive
taking money from his wallet here it is
taking the money greedily if id known what all that tennis nonsense of yours was going to lead to i wouldnt have run out on you
what are you trying to say miriam
come out with it
tucking the bills away im not getting a divorce
tense and angry why you little doublecrosser
i didnt want this divorce you did
thats what youve been harping about for the past year
its a womans privilege to change her mind
now i can shop for some pretty clothes
i wouldnt want you to be ashamed of me in washington when we go to all those dinners and swanky parties
and what do you mean by that
coyly dont look so mad guy
you always smile when your picture is being taken for the papers
converted to pdf by www
especially when you have anne burton hanging on your arm
lets not talk about anne burton
so its really serious between you two
well you can throw your dreams about her into the ashcan
guy im coming to washington
to have my baby and be with you
its not my baby
but people dont know that guy do they
it would make a pretty story wouldnt it the senators daughter involved with a married man whos about to become a father
furiously you black conniving little liar
a few people in the shop look around as guys voice rises above the sound of the record playing
keep your voice down
did he run out on you
no man runs out on me
not even you
youre a liar and a cheat miriam
youve wanted to get rid of me long enough and now ill go you one better i never want to see or hear of you again
converted to pdf by www
demurely i could be very pathetic as the deserted little mother in a courtroom guy
think it over
who would believe you
guy seizes her angrily and in so doing knocks the tone arm across the record with a loud screech
from outside we can see heads turn
hargreaves the manager is very disturbed
we see guy gripping miriams arms and apparently addressing her in a threatening manner although we do not hear his words
the smile has faded from miriams face and something like cringing fear has taken its place
she is drawn and tense and seems to cower beneath guys rage
hargreaves moves forward and opens guys tirade
thats what should happen to people like you
and if i
interrupts break it up folks
this isnt the place for a family quarrel
his eyes blazing sorry
he starts to exit from the booth
miriam grabs his arm and screams at him yelling like a fishwife you heard what i said guy haines
you cant throw me away like an old shoe
im coming to washington to have my baby
tell that to the senate
guy strides out of the store the manager and a few customers turning around in surprise
converted to pdf by www
the two customers in other booths seeing the quarrel open their doors simultaneously and miriams tirade is climaxed by a cacophony of noise a big symphony loud hot music and
the apparently unaware piano tuner
guy is striding along angrily
he comes to the same intersection and the same cop
the officer makes a friendly gesture is if hed like to talk awhile but guy strides past him without noticing
guy comes into the scene crosses to a row of public telephone booths enters one
inside the telephone booth he dumps some loose change on the shelf sticks a nickel in the telephone speaks into it
a pause i want washington d
the number is republic
person to person
miss anne burton
another pause very long
guy is very restless
he digs a cigarette out of his pocket and sticks it in his mouth then looks through his pockets for his lighter doesnt find it
he looks puzzled but about that time the operator speaks to him
guy picks coins up off the shelf and drops them into the telephone then waits
he shifts the receiver and fumbles in his other jacket pocket then turns to the phone
tautly into phone anne anne darling
yes im in metcalf gets a grip on himself no everything didnt go smoothly
she doesnt want a divorce not now
converted to pdf by www
anne burton is a beautiful high spirited and well bred young woman
the smile on her face his faded to anxiety as she listens over the telephone which is on the desk
after a pause then with unpleasant realization another mans child
but she cant do that to you guy its unbelievable its its evil
she listens then calmly yes i know how you must feel
pause but you sound so savage
furiously sure i sound savage
i feel savage
id like to break her neck
a pause then raising his voice i said id like to break her foul poisonous useless little neck
the connection is bad and he strains to hear whats that
meantime the noise of a through train has been heard and the horn on a streamliner locomotive
it has come up very fast it is now almost to the station
guy rises his voice and yells into the telephone
his voice fights the roar of the train the expression on his face is frenzied and suggesting that he means exactly what he is saying

the scene opens on a closeup of a mans hands
one of them is semi flexed and turning slowly the other is receiving the final touches of a manicure
camera pulls back to reveal that these are brunos hands and that he is studying them moodily camera pulls back farther to reveal his mother mrs
anthony sitting opposite him at a little table in the anthony living room
she is working with scissors file and nail buffer
anthony is a gentle once pretty woman whose pastel exterior harbors a tigress like determination to protect her son bruno is in his robe and is unshaven
there is evidence of long established wealth in the heavy dark appointments of this room
since you insisted on a manicure dear i do wish youd keep your hands quiet
youre so restless lately
almost dreamily as he admires the free hand i like them to look just right
anthony looks up notices his moody expression
did i file them too short

anxiously but you have that look

he denies this with a slow solemn shake of his head
i do hope youve forgotten about that silly little plan of yours
sharply which one
smiling about blowing up the white house
his eyes dancing i was only kidding ma
besides what would the president say
laughing gaily youre a naughty boy bruno
but you can always make me laugh
she rises now get shaved dear before your father gets home
brunos fist crashes down on the little table upsetting it as he gets to his feet
im sick and tired of bowing and scraping to the king
placating him now now lets not lose control
come see my painting dear she leads him toward an easel i do wish youd take up painting
its such a soothing pastime
they look at the painting
converted to pdf by www
the painting is a horrible mess
out of the violence of the pattern a mans face can be discerned wild eyed and distorted
we hear laughter from bruno
brunos roar of laughter puzzles mrs
anthony but she is pleased to hear his good humor
he puts an arm around her
youre wonderful ma
its the old boy all right
bewildered it is
i was trying to paint saint francis
at this moment there is the sound of the front door opening
then immediately the telephone bell rings in the hall
bruno is instantly alert as if he had been expecting a call
he goes toward the door to the hall as the butler enters
to bruno they are ready with your call to southampton sir
brunos father mr
anthony purposefully enters the living room
he an impeccably dressed business man with an uncompromising eye
his entrance momentarily blocks brunos exit
to her husband how nice that youre early charles

bruno now exits into the hall passing his father without speaking
just a minute eunice
calls after bruno bruno
i want to talk to you and your mother
converted to pdf by www
as he approaches the telephone
calls back to his father sorry father
he picks up the telephone hello
camera moves in to a big head closeup of bruno at the telephone as the voices of his mother and father can be heard from the other room
now its hit and run driving
and you knew about it all the time
eagerly into phone guy
pause bruno bruno anthony
youre going to protect him once too often

bruno gives a look in his fathers direction before he speaks into the telephone in a low voice
i just wanted to ask how you made out with miriam
whod you say you were
converted to pdf by www
sotto voce bruno guy
dont you remember
on the train
the voices of mr
anthony can still be heard in dispute as bruno listens at phone i never permit it
bruno gives a significant look in direction of the living room as he speaks into the phone
softly are you getting your divorce
i tell you he should be sent somewhere for treatment before its too late
into phone with satisfaction so she double crossed you
are you going to see her again
the phone clicks in brunos ear
he looks hurt for an instant then replaces the receiver
bruno listens to his father off scene and his expression becomes more enigmatic
i tell you eunice im going to have that boy put away if its the last thing i do
bruno looks off in direction of his farthers voice with an expression which says crow while you can you havent much time
he reaches into his pocket brings out guys cigarette lighter and as he flicks it on and off
this is the same shot we saw when guy arrived in metcalf
we see the station and one of the main streets beyond the station
converted to pdf by www
we see the train come around the curve
again this is just the same angle that we used for guy
it comes to a stop in the foreground and we see bruno alight onto the platform
he looks about him for a moment and then strolls away in the direction of the town
he approaches the row of telephone booths
we see bruno enter the small booth and start to glance through the telephone directory
brunos finger runs down the names until it stops at joyce miriam haines
it is now much later
it is beginning to get dark and the street lights are on
in the far distance we see a local bus approaching
shooting down onto a small seat by a bus stop we see bruno with an open newspaper in front of him
it is held up as he reads it
bruno is glancing over the top of the paper
from his viewpoint we see a typical frame house
the upper windows are lit as are the lower ones as well
a woman is sitting in a rocker on the front porch
this is mrs
joyce miriams mother
she has white hair
a woman comes along the street and pauses as she gets to mrs
converted to pdf by www
calls out as she passes hello mrs
warm aint it
that it is
ive been reading where your son in laws been coming right along at tennis
sourly we dont have any interest in tennis any more
the neighbor passes on
bruno still glancing over the top of his paper
again from brunos viewpoint we see miriams house
at this moment the front door swings open emitting a long streak ot bright light
we see the silhouette of a woman emerge followed by two other men
theyre laughing and joking
suddenly they look up the street
at this very moment the bus pulls up in front of brunos view cutting off the sight of his quarry
the bus comes to a stop
bruno rises in alarm and moves around toward the end of the bus so that he shall not lose sight of the girl coming out of the house
from his viewpoint the girl whom we now see is miriam is running followed by the two young men
they are calling for the bus not to go shouting hi stop
joyce calls from the porch dont you stay out too late miriam
converted to pdf by www
calling back goodnight mother
see you later
bruno watches miriam
miriam comes nearer and nearer to bruno
with her two companions she brushes past him and jumps onto the bus
the we see the bus pull up outside the amusement park and the various passengers alight
these include miriam nd her companions and bruno
we see the usual midway with its various concessions on each side in the distance the ferris wheel merry go rounds etc
and beyond that a lake
in the foreground we see people filling in and out
this group comprises miriam and her two boy friends
they lick their way out of the crowd and debate between themselves where to go next
miriams eye catches the attention of something off screen
from her viewpoint we see bruno standing and casually watching her
other people pass around and in front of him so that he is the only immobile figure
converted to pdf by www
miriam with a kind of coy consciousness turns away with the others and they go on to some other concession
as bruno starts to advance in the direction of miriam he is momentarily held up by a small boy in cowboy uniform carrying a gun and a balloon
the small boy points the gun at bruno
the small boy pointing the gun fires it twice with a couple of bangs
he then starts to move off
bruno moves on past the boy
he casually touches the balloon with his cigarette end it goes off with a pop
the small boy turns and looks with dismay at his pricked balloon wondering what happened
bruno moves on pleased with himself returning his attention to miriam who is somewhere ahead of him
miriam and her two boy friends by the sledge hammer concession where the aim is to swing the hammer hard enough down onto its target to ring the bell and
register the mark
miriam is in the foreground of the shot
the first boy steps up to try his hand
as he swings miriam turns and glances about her obviously looking for bruno
the crowds milling but no sign of bruno
converted to pdf by www
the first boy having failed to ring the bell the second stops up and slams the hammer down
the register shooting up only to the hallway mark
she looks a little disdainful and again glances around for bruno
looking first to her left where she sees nothing she then looks to her right and as she does the camera pans to show bruno standing right it her shoulder
miriam gives a little start
bruno smiles at her
with a smirk he walks over and after paying his fee goes to take up the hammer
she watches bruno
bruno looks down at his hands
brunos two strong hands as he holds them palms tilted upward and fingers curled in
bruno as he smiles faintly glancing across at miriam
she gives a faint smile in return
with a studied movement bruno picks up the handle of the hammer and swings
converted to pdf by www
the register shoots up to the mark and rings the bell
bruno drops the hammer and glances around at miriam again
her two boy friends are calling for her from a little distance
come on miriam
she turns away and is lost in the crowd
bruno turns to follow miriam his manner casual
as he takes a few steps we pan across with him until over his shoulder we see a merry go round in the background
miriam and the two boys are aboard and climbing onto horses
as bruno goes toward the merry go round the camera moves up a little with him
the merry go round starts to move slowly round as bruno hops on
bruno begins to look around for miriam who is apparently on the other side of the merry go round
he starts to thread his way through the horses which are beginning to move up and down
camera following him
he passes one or two of the oncoming heads before he reaches miriam
she is on an outside mount which is high in the air when she sees bruno facing her
her laughter dies for a moment and she smiles at him coyly
bruno passes her and gets on the horse directly behind her miriam glancing at him as her horse comes down
with horses head in foreground as it is coming toward us
converted to pdf by www
miriam on her horse moving from left to right
miriam holding the reins glances back with a gay laugh
bruno on his horse as though he is chasing miriam
he is a little more open now in his laughter
miriam and her boy friends begin to sing the song being played on the calliope
as she starts to sing she glances back
he is starting to join in the singing
the horses of the merry go round are filling the screen as they whizz by and again we get the picture of bruno chasing miriam as they rush past the
camera the music and tempo at a high speed
across the water may be seen a small wooded island
between this and the boat landing there is an artificially constructed tunnel of love
we see miriam and her companions approach the boat concession and camera follows them onto the little landing stage
camera moves up slowly over the boys shoulders until we get miriam in close up
she glances back
her expression changes to a coy smile of satisfaction as she sees converted to pdf by www
bruno is approaching the pay box
miriam and her companions are escorted to a small boat with electric motor
once they are seated the boat chugs away from the landing stage and off into the darkness
bruno steps into the foreground and gets into the next boat which floats alongside
he too moves away into the darkness
as miriams boat passes through she gives another little glance over shoulder before her boat disappears into the darkness of the tunnel
after a brief moment brunos boat comes into the picture and it too goes into the tunnel
we see the silhouettes of the occupants of miriams boat on the wall of the tunnel lit dimly from the light coming from the tunnel exit
the silhouette of bruno in his boat lit by the tunnel entrance gradually approaches the other three
when the silhouettes are almost touching we it is empty
there is a sudden piercing scream from inside followed after a second or two by protestations and giggling as miriams boat emerges into the light
she is pushing one of the boys away from her
squealing george stop it i tell you
their boat moves out of the picture toward the island
presently brunos boat comes smilingly following and he too moves on out of the picture
converted to pdf by www
the group of miriam and her companions are scrambling out of their boat and moving onto the island one of the boys trying the boat on the shore
they disappear into the woods of the island
again brunos boat comes into the picture
he steps out lift the prow of the boat a little onto the shore
we see the amusement park lighted beyond the lake
silhouetted in the foreground the trees and foliage of the island
nearby we see the silhouetted figures of miriam and her companions move across the scene right to left
miriam is pushing george away from her
protesting perfunctorily george no
she backs away from him and the boys go on picture
miriam goes in another direction around the bushes
george obviously misses her for we hear his voice call out miriam
miriam backs out of the bushes until the back of her head is in closeup in the foreground of the shot
suddenly she hears steps in back of her and turns her head toward camera
her face changes as she recognizes someone offscene
she gives a coy smile of recognition
camera pulls back to reveal the mad and shoulders of bruno between miriam and the camera
his hand holds guys lighter which he flicks on as he raises it above miriams face
f bruno we see only the back of his head and shoulders
is your name miriam
with surprise why yes
how did you converted to pdf by www
we see brunos gloved hands dart quickly to miriams throat
the lighter falls down out of picture and as brunos hands grip her throat his head moves slightly to blot out miriams face
his head moves a bit farther until miriams face is nearly uncovered at the other side of the screen and we see her glasses fall off
miriams glasses hit the ground
the shadows of their struggling figures over the shot
the screen is filled with one of the lenses of the glasses
they are of the diminishing type
against the moonlit sky we see reflected the elongated struggling figures as though we were shooting up at them
suddenly one of the figures falls forward
miriams head drops into the picture by the glasses
brunos hand comes into the picture and picks up the glasses
one of the lenses has been broken by miriams fall
as we see brunos sport shoes move away the camera moves past miriams head until it comes to guys lighter pressed into the earth
bruno glances back over his shoulder
he looks down and goes back one or two steps
brunos hands retrieve the lighter from the ground
we see a full view of the island again with the amusement park beyond
the faint noise of the calliope continues in the distance
bruno has been lost to view
converted to pdf by www
miriams companions are still searching for her
we hear their faint voices in the distance
where are you
bruno comes to the shore where his boat is moored
he gets in and is quickly chugging away
he moves calmly matter of fact and not furtively
brunos boat throbbing its way across toward the landing stage
there are two boats unloading
brunos boat is approaching
we hear a loud call from the island
someone has found miriam
hey here she is
whats the matter with her
has she fainted
more shouts from the island cause the people at the landing stage to look back
the boatmans attention is also attracted
suddenly as bruno is getting out of boat there is a loud scream from the island
crying out she is dead
from island help
bruno by this time has stopped onto the landing stage and in company with the other people is looking back as if to see whats wrong on the island
then he moves away starting off of the landing stage
the boatman turns and glances at bruno but quickly returns his attention to the disturbance across on the island
he hurries forward and with a couple of men passengers jumps into one of the boats
he calls to his assistant as he gets into the boat

got a cop
the assistant runs off out of the pictures as bruno calmly threads his way along the midway we hear above the noise of the various concessions a shrill police whistle
in the distance
presently a couple of policemen comes running from direction of the main entrance and past bruno
he glances at them over his shoulder then strolls on toward the main entrance to the park
as bruno comes out through the turnstile he stands for a moment on the street
at this moment a man hesitates at the curbstone
he is blind and tapping the sidewalk with his white cane
he takes one step into the roadway then hesitates
bruno steps forward and takes the blind mans arm
camera pulls back as bruno escorts the blind man across the road
with a sweeping gesture he holds back a couple of cars to lot them pass
once on the other side of the road the blind man utters his thanks
he goes off
bruno looks back toward the park then glances down at his wristwatch
the time is
through the rear window we see the tracks rushing away from us
seated in the foreground are guy haines and a rather professorial type opposite him a bespectacled man around forty five or fifty who is extremely drunk
converted to pdf by www
he is reading an evening newspaper
the feet opposite guy stretch out and touch guys feet
he lowers his paper and looks across
the drunk opposite guy looks down at his feet and then up to guy resentfully as though guy had kicked him
he eyes guy up and down then suddenly without warning bursts into song to the tune of the barber shop chord
there was a man now please take note
there was a man who had a goat
he loved that goat indeed he did
he loved that goat just like a kid
he stops singing abruptly and addresses guy what is your opinion
amused youll never make the metropolitan
fuzzily pumping guys hand names collins

a solitary taxi is seen driving past the capitol building
the taxi comes to a side street and stops outside a small apartment house
guy gets out of the taxi with his rackets and bag pays the driver and goes up the steps to the front door of his apartment
as guy is about to enter the front door and we see his name posted on a small card as one of the several tenants he hears a soft call
from across the street
guy turns his head and looks across the street
we see a small space between two houses across the street
out of the darkness the voice repeats
over here guy
he turns and with a slightly bewildered and wary expression goes out of the picture to cross the street

guy reaches the other side of the street and still puzzled and cautious approaches the dark alleyway
after a moment a figure steps out of the darkness
it is bruno
he steps back into the darkness again as guy comes up to him
guy frowning in puzzlement as he looks at bruno
cheerfully hello guy
recognizes bruno not pleased what are you doing here
at this time of night
a little sadly you dont seem very pleased to see me guy
guy stands without answering
pleased again i brought you a little present

brunos hand comes out of his pocket and he hands miriams glasses to guy
guys hands taking miriams glasses from bruno
one of the lenses is broken

whats this all about
he looks down at the glasses mystified
he looks up again to bruno
it was very quick guy

he is horrified
he looks swiftly down at the glasses in his hand then back to bruno
bragging i know youd be surprised

concerned if you go to the police now youll just be turning yourself in as in accessory

at this moment both turn at a sound across the street
we hear the sound of a telephone ringing in guys apartment
the top of one of his windows is open
what is it
amused someone has some news for you guy
guy still stares across the street
we see a police car pull up outside guys apartment
bruno pulls guy back further into the shadows
guy instinctively flattens himself against the wall
he looks across the street again
we see the two policemen go into his apartment building
guy is still flattened against the wall to keep out of light
tell them you know about it already guy

he looks across at the police then down at himself with some surprise and disgust then over at bruno suddenly conscious he is behaving like a criminal and that bruno
is responsible for his predicament
muttering youve got me acting like a criminal you crazy fool
bruno for a moment looks menacingly at guy
dont you call me that
brunos flare of anger dies
they both look again across the street
the two policemen come out of the house get into their car and drive off
guys telephone is still ringing
you must be tired guy
i know i am

guy looks at him almost numb
now look guy about my father

i never want to see you again
he goes in and slams the door in brunos face
to the closed door but we have to he realizes there is no use in trying to talk to guy any further
he turns and faces the camera in close up as he moves away looking sad almost to the point of tears
guy is standing at the telephone which is still ringing
he has miriams glasses in his hand
he looks down at them for a moment then picks up the receiver
he hesitates then speaks into the phone
hoarsely into phone yes

a taxi drives up and stops in front of a handsome residence
it is the burton home
guy gets out of the taxi and goes up the steps
his figure tense he rings the bell
after a moments wait the door is opened from inside and anne burton stands in the lighted hallway
she looks at guy with an anxious taut expression searches his face hastily then as he takes a step inside she is suddenly in his arms
they embrace with wordless fervor
holding her close anne darling youre trembling
anne draws back and looks into his face as if searching for an answer to some question in her mind

forcing herself to be calm before we go into the living room
father wants to see you
he looks apprehensively in direction of the living room conscious of what the news is to be but covering up
senator burton and barbara burton are seated near a desk on the farthest side of the room
senator burton is a distinguished fifty a man with great pride in tradition his family and his career
barbara annes younger sister is a lively seventeen who loves excitement says exactly what she thinks and rarely thinks before she says it
superficially in height and figure she resembles miriam
she also weirs glasses
by her gestures we gather she is speaking urgently but softly to her father who lifts a weary hand to quiet her as she looks toward guy in the hallway
barbara keeps quiet and also looks toward guy
they both wait for him to enter
he steels himself for the long walk across the hall and the living room
watching guy closely
as guy starts to make the long trek across the living room with anne behind him stiffly good evening sir

barbara has been squirming in her seat then as if jet propelled she catapults out of it and runs to guy giving him a big hug and a smack on
something awful has happened guy
firmly sit down barbara
subdued she sits down
but guy remains standing
finding it difficult to begin there seems to be no way of diplomatically breaking tragic news
im sorry guy to be the one to tell you
it concerns your wife
shes been murdered
guy stares woodenly at the senator is if hypnotized
the police have been using everything but radar to locate you
youre to call headquarters at metcalf
the full impact of what has happened hits guy once more
with inner tension she was
slowly guys eyes meet hers
they are remembering what he said on the phone i could strangle her
he sinks into a chair
the senator is quite distressed
during the following scene barbara quietly goes about the business of pouring drinks and serving them
she knows everyones preference

wrylt to guy it happened on an island in an amusement park
it was sort of a lovers lane i believe

they were the ones who found her
so theyre not suspects
but you probably will be
young lady we cant overlook the fact that murder is at our doorsteps
but i forbid you to drag it into the living room
wide eyed lets not fool ourselves
the police will say guy wanted miriam out of the way so he could marry anne
in a crime of this sort the police first go after the husband and guy had every motive
quietly shes right

disconcerted but whistling in dark oh come now my boy

annes nervous tension comes to the surface in a flood of relief
i told myself over and over i was being silly but there was one horrible moment tonight when the news came through
i kept remembering what you shouted telephone from metcalf

a knot of people are hanging around the entrance including a few newspaper photographers
there is a rush of interest when a taxi pulls up and guy steps out of it
guy pushes his way through the people
two or three bulbs flash
there is a murmur from the crowd and we hear guys name
he passes into the entrance
guy comes into the corridor from the street and approaches two policemen who are standing nearby
captain turleys office
one of the policemen gestures to a door at the right
guy crosses and enters
at one side of the room is a young police sergeant seated at a typewriter
a group of people are seated in chairs lined against the opposite wall
guy enters crosses to the sergeant at the desk
captain turley is expecting me
just a moment mr
he rises and goes into an adjoining room
he now has time to take stock of the waiting people
he catches his breath when he sees miriams mother dressed all in black is seated in one of the chairs
she has been staring at the floor but brings her eyes up slowly to glare at guy with a look of burning hatred

a fierce whisper youll pay for this
hargreaves from the music shop looks across at guy attempts in awkward nod but is very embarrassed
guy nods in returns
the two boys who were with miriam at the amusement park
they look at guy with interest
he looks about him uncomfortably then turns suddenly as he sees seated behind guy apart from the others who are waiting is professor collins guys drunken companion on the train
of the night before
the professor is completely sober now dignified and erect
he has removed his glasses to polish them and does not react to guys presence
guy starts with a smile of recognition to say how do you do
but at that moment he hears the door open and his name called will you come in please mr
guy breaks away from his uncompleted greeting to the professor and goes through the door to captain turleys office followed by the eyes of the waiting people
converted to pdf by www
captain turley is conscientious methodical and always polite
he puts aside photographs and records and rises from behind his desk as guy comes in
a detective lieutenant campbell is attending a coffee maker
their expressions are grave by contrast with guys confident attitude after seeing the professor in the waiting room
good of you to be so prompt mr
this is lieutenant campbell
the two nod to each other wont you sit down
thank you sir
he sits i know youre a busy man so we wont detain you any longer than necessary
now you already been good enough to tell us where you were last evening and weve managed to locate the gentleman you spoke with on the train
turley signals to campbell to call the professor in
i saw him outside
at open door will you come in please professor
he looks up eagerly
professor collins comes in and sits in a chair opposite guy
professor collins this is mr
he was with you on the train last night

the professor studies guy for a moment then awkwardly turns to turley
im terribly sorry but i really dont remember meeting this gentleman
his confident expression fades
he turns from the captain to guy
apologetically unfortunately i remember very little about the journey from new york
you see there had been a little celebration guy interrupts with a slight note of impatience
but we were sitting opposite each other in the observation car
you were singing a song about a goat incredulously a goat
urgently and calculus
you were going over a speech youd made
turley and campbell are watching closely
im sorry mr
shakes his head i certainly must have celebrated
i cant remember you at all
converted to pdf by www
momentarily guy is frustrated then he turns quietly to turley
calmly logically captain is it so important whether or not professor collins remember me
surely the important thing is that ive been able to name a man who was on the train with me
youve been able to find him
isnt that proof of where i was at nine thirty last night
guy asks this question with a look of near triumph that he has clearly established his alibi
the burtons are having coffee
barbara has been glancing through a new murder mystery with a lurid cover
as guy enters anne rises to greet him
have you had your dinner
on the train
you werent in metcalf all this time
we expected you hours ago
flatly i didnt
they sometimes throw a suspect in the can and keep him there all night
after a disapproving glance at barbara sit down guy
give him some coffee anne
converted to pdf by www
back to guy you had no trouble with the police of course once they verified your alibi
morosely when an alibi is full of bourbon sir it cant stand up
you mean the professor was boiled
he didnt remember me
but you knew he was on the train
wasnt that enough to prove you were on it too
apparently not at the right time
they suggested i could have caught the train at baltimore after miriam was murdered
they had it all worked out taps his head in their timetables
growing indignant and increasingly nervous thats ridiculous
theyre acting as if you were guilty
somewhat subdued and trying to be comforting everything will be all right anne
the police were just being thorough shes unsure of herself and defers to the senator werent they daddy
i certainly hope so
to guy what is your next step

wryly whatever it is the police will know it
they gave me a present come take a look
he crosses to the window lifts the curtain slightly then turns back to the others
continuing my guardian angel
the group move to look out the window the senator with reluctance
through the window we see the figure of a man across the street
he is lighting a cigarette and strolling up and down
impressed youre being tailed
turning to them thats leslie hennessy
he works sixteen hours a day
somebody else takes over for the next eight
drops the curtain turns back into room as a matter of fact hennessys a very nice fellow
shouldnt we ask him in for coffee or something
nobody bothers to answer her
the senator is disturbed but confident of his own prestige as he goes back to his coffee
ill have him called off immediately of course

calmly im afraid where i go hennessy goes
even to the senate
pausing with his cup hallway to his mouth is he likely to picket my office
the senators cup is suddenly back on its saucer and he is on his feet pacing nervously
i would suggest guy for your own peace of mind of course that you work here at the house for a few days
a pause it would be less embarrassing for you
guy has been looking at anne and is concerned at the worry on her face
he nods in assent to the senators suggestion but puts his hand over annes
hopelessly then what about practicing
perhaps id better forget forest hills
my dear boy wouldnt it look rather awkward if you suddenly canceled all your plans
hes right guy
you mustnt do anything that would look suspicious
youve got to carry on as though nothing has happened
pointing out the window escorted by mr

the burtons watch him
hello his face wears the most affable expression
i tried your apartment but pause why guy this is bruno
guy hangs up the telephone quickly
he looks at the others awkwardly tries to explain must be some mistake
it wasnt for me
his embarrassment grows as anne looks at him with a puzzled expression
guy and hennessy are walking along the street together camera moving with them
their relationship is most friendly
guy carries a briefcase
hennessy is an amiable but not gullible young man in his early thirties
he knows his job is well groomed well educated and well liked

he turns to light a cigarette
as he does guy gives a barely perceptible start at what he sees offscene
the tiny figure of a man is standing at the base of the tall white column
the figure lifts in arm and waves
instinct tells us that this is bruno
hennessy is still mumbling his opinion of politics
if he knew you were getting into that rat race guy turns his back on brunos figure and looks frantically toward to street wanting to get away

he hails a taxi which is cruising by and they start to get in
guy directs the driver
pentagon building please

i always get lost
guy turns and looks out of the window
from guys viewpoint shot through the cab window
again we see the solitary figure of bruno looking after guy and beginning to recede with the background as the cab starts off
as guy comes in from outside there is a note on the floor that has been pushed under the door
guy picks it up stares at it for a minute before he opens it
he takes out a handwritten note and reads it with an expression of disgust

anne stops and looks back
guy knows who it is and would not turn but that he is forced to by annes action

she is getting a book from one of the top shelves of a bookcase which is next to a window
are you getting in any practice today guy
as he takes out a large folded sheet of paper and glances at it mystified yes if i can get a court at the club
as guys hands unfold the paper and hold it for moment we see that it is a diagrammed plan of the grounds and the interior of the anthony house
there are dotted lines along the upper hall with an arrow which points to one room and where bruno has indicated in his handwriting my fathers room

there are twenty or thirty people sitting in the bleacher seats opposite the umpires chair
a game of mixed doubles is in progress
guy appears carrying his racquets
his partner for the forthcoming game and one or two other players are close by
guy looks about him
several people are looking at him awkwardly or avoiding his eyes
he moves self consciously away and the camera pans him around the court to the umpires chair
a couple of women players whisper something about guy as he goes past them

as guy stands at the umpires chair the umpire glances down and gives him a rather embarrassed greeting
he looks across at the watching crowd
the heads of the people in the bleachers move from side to side to follow the play on the court
one head is not moving
it is staring at guy
it is bruno
at this moment we hear the umpire calling game set and match to the winning mixed doubles pair
his expression becomes set
the mixed doubles couples complete their handshaking at the net and move off the court
we see guy move up to the base line while the other player takes his position for the preliminary knock up
as guy casually knocks the ball across the net he glances again toward bruno
bruno is making his way out of the small stand
converted to pdf by www
perplexed and apprehensive as to what bruno may be up to
he hears his opponents voice
guy shakes off his abstraction and poises himself to receive the ball
we see guy coming alone having finished his game
he is carrying his rackets wears a towel around his neck etcetera
he walks into foreground into closeup and suddenly stops short at what he sees the group at the table comprising bruno anne and the two french people
bruno is preening himself as the others laugh uproariously obviously at something bruno has said
anne catches sight of guy and smiles at him
camera moves with him as he comes forward toward the table
as guy comes into the scene
he stands staring
guy darling this is mr
antony a friend of monsieur and madame darville
to bruno guy haines
he gives a weak acknowledgment in brunos direction realizing that bruno has wormed his way into the group and that he must accept the introduction

bruno half rises smiles affably at guy reaches out his hand
guy is forced to shake hands with him ive been a fan of yours for a long time mr
in fact i follow everything you do
antony has been telling us such charming stories
he gives another weak little smile
in response to the frenchwomans attentive and eager expression bruno leans forward on the table and starts saying something more in extremely fluent french
she is staring at bruno with a new expression
brunos coat has spread open a bit and his tie pin bearing the name bruno is resting on the edge of the table
she becomes aware that this is the man she has seen call to guy in the art museum that they have met before
her eyes turn a little in guys direction though she does not look at him
he is still watching bruno talk to the french couple
guy is unaware of annes looks
suddenly his attention is arrested by the sound of barbaras voice calling him
converted to pdf by www
he turn his head and camera pans him to barbara who is standing a few steps from the table beckoning to him
sotto voce ive just been talking to your shadow
very impressed guy did you know mr
hennessy helped crack that axe murder i was reading about
you know the one where the body was cut up and hidden in the butcher shop
he was locked in the ice box with the left leg for six hours
he pulls those yarns right out of his hat babs
he gives a sharp look back toward bruno
there is more laughter coming from the french couple at the table
bruno is occupied with his french joke but anne is looking at guy strangely
guy turns back to barbara
barbara looks with interest toward bruno
whos the nice looking frenchman with the darvilles
hes not french

barbara steps toward the table

bruno stops in the middle of some french to stare at barbara
her voice continues
how are you
delightful to see you
how sweet you look miss barbara
i hope you arent forgetting our little party on thursday madame
from brunos viewpoint as barbara speaks camera moves in closer until to faintest impression of the merry go round fills the screen with the effect of whirling around barbaras head
her glasses seem to glint until her eyes are obliterated by the glare
we are planning on it
but of course
all talk dies out as all eyes turn to bruno who is staring at barbara
except annes who is saying quietly to bruno this is my sister barbara
barbara this is mr
he does not acknowledge the introduction immediately
he is still staring at barbara
then he nods abstractedly

she is looking at bruno wondering what mystery lies behind this strange individual and why he and guy have disclaimed any previous acquaintance
camera pulls back to show guy staring down at it
he is partially dressed for an evening party in black bow tie but without his jacket
he leans forward to take up a letter from among brown paper wrappings on the table
dear guy just two more days left
we must get together for final details
the note in brunos handwriting is unsigned
he stares down at the note
at this moment there is a knock at the door
guy hastily gather together the gun the note and the wrappings and puts them in a dresser drawer

he takes out a handkerchief closes the drawer sticks the handkerchief in his pocket speaking as he does so

mildly he thinks youre a very suspicious character
he doesnt trust anybody
not even himself
guy is eager to get out of the room and hennessy is maddeningly slow in his movements
indicating at hennessy overcoat dont forget your sleeping bag
taking his time yeah if i have to wait too long on the sidewalk my feet get cold

hes gone and with a last glance at the dresser guy goes out and closes the door
the street outside the burton house is lined with cars and limousines
various guests are arriving
on the opposite side of the street we see hennessy now wearing his topcoat
he looks bored as he glances across the street to the house
her face is troubled
camera begins to pull back
we see now that the reception is in progress and that anne stands beside her father to greet the arriving guests
camera pulls back further to show us a full view of a very crowded washington gathering many white ties and tails and decollete in evidence
even some foreign languages are being spoken
music and chatter in the b
anne and the senator are still greeting new arrivals
annes manner is somewhat preoccupied
she glances around as she speaks as though looking for someone
to new arrival thank you so much mr
well look forward to it
the camera passes various groups of guests in conversation including guy and barbara who are together
from this distance we cannot hear what they are saying
camera continues to the front door
it opens to admit a new arrival
it is bruno
he wears white tie and tails looking very elegant
converted to pdf by www
we see guy excuse himself from barbara cross to bruno and speak to him angrily obviously asking what are you doing here
bruno however greets guy with a smile then turns from him unperturbed and bland
he sees anne and moves toward her smiling
as bruno comes in her direction annes expression shows her mystification and concern about brunos presence and about guys attitude toward him
bruno comes up to anne and the senator
he gives a slight bow to the senator then puts his hand out to anne
good evening miss burton
the senator looks inquiringly
anne makes the introduction
this is mr
how do you do sir
id like to talk to you sometime senator about my idea of harnessing the life force
it will make atomic power look like the horse and buggy
the senator and anne are beginning to look at him in amazement im already developing my faculty for seeing millions of miles
and senator can you imagine being able to smell a flower on the planet of mars
id like to lunch with you some day soon and tell you more about it
interrupted by new arrivals bruno moves away out of the picture with a charming smile to anne
the senator greets the new guests with open mouth and simply shakes their hands while glancing off in direction of the departing bruno
converted to pdf by www
to senator so nice to see you my dear senator
ah yes indeed i beg your pardon
she realizes he hasnt heard a word shes said and haughtily moves on
the senator turns to anne
still looking after bruno i dont remember inviting that young man
who is he
a friend of the darvilles
he has an unusual personality
she looks off in brunos direction extremely disturbed at this new aspect of the mysterious stranger
he is watching bruno
guy sees bruno join a group of several ladies who are seated on a settee and a couple of older men who are standing by
a waiter comes along with a tray of drinks
bruno takes one
she comes from the same direction that guy came
she stops short as she sees bruno is now heartily joining in conversation with one of the elderly gentlemen
converted to pdf by www
bruno talking to an elderly dignified gentlemen
but tell me judge after youve sentenced a man to the chair isnt it difficult to go and eat your dinner after that
young man when a murderer is caught he must be tried
when he is convicted he must be sentenced
when he is sentenced to death he must be executed
quite impersonal isnt it sir
so it is
besides it doesnt happen every day
at this moment anne comes into the scene
she hesitates as she hears brunos answer
so few murderers are caught
the judge moves out of the way
bruno smiles blandly at the ladies
one of them speaks to him
antony you seem very interested in the subject of murder
anne looks more troubled then moves on out of the scene
no more than anyone else
no more than you for instance
im not interested in murder
bruno pulls up a chair to face the two woman on the settee sits down straddling the seat to look at them over the back of the chair and settle
down for a nice conversation
converted to pdf by www
his tone is teasing oh come now everyones interested in that
everyone would like to put someone out of the way
now surely madame youre not going to tell me that there hasnt been a time when you wanted to dispose of someone
your husband for instance
laughs good heavens no
playfully ah ah
shaking a finger at her are you sure
do you mean to tell me there wasnt a tiny moment when youd been made really angry
and what did you say

oh no mrs
converted to pdf by www
bang bang all over the place
the other woman joins in what about a little poison
thats better thats better
he is thoroughly enjoying himself thats better mrs
cunningham is in a dreadful hurry
poison could take
ten to twelve weeks if poor mr
cunningham is to die from natural causes
i have a wonderful idea
i can take him out in the car and when i get to a lonely spot knock him on the head with a hammer pour gasoline over him and over
the car and start the whole thing ablaze
looks at her deprecatingly and then have to walk all that way home
no i have the best way and the best tools
he holds out his hands and shows them simple silent and quick
the silent part being the most important
let me show you what i mean
converted to pdf by www
he raises his hands toward mrs
cunninghams throat then stops a moment to ask you dont mind if i borrow your neck for a moment do you
giggles well its not for long
he takes a drink and puts his glass down now when i nod my head just see if you can cry out and i bet you cant
he places his hands around mrs
cunninghams neck now with my two thumbs
you see thats where ill be able to prevent any sound coming from you
now just wait for the nod of my head
as he starts to press her neck his eyes wander from the face of his victim to someone else off scene
she is watching this rather unorthodox demonstration
the camera moves up until her head fills the screen
her glasses glint in the light
he is now transfixed
his breathing becomes heavy
a strange expression comes over his face
he still stares off at barbara
we see the whirling merry go round spinning around her head
converted to pdf by www
he now seem to have almost gone into a trance
over the shot we begin to hear a strangled cry and a broken exclamation then mrs
brunos wrists and hands and the neck of his victim
we can just see mrs
cunninghams chin at the top of the screen
her head is tossing from side to side
her hands are clutching at brunos wrists
the hands of the other two women also in the picture are pulling at brunos wrists
cunninghams hands begin to slide off
her head drops back
over this we hear cries of stop him
pull him off
his body is swaying slightly at the various efforts to drag him away from mrs
his eyes begin to close and slowly he falls away from the picture in a dead faint on the floor
there is a rush of people around mrs
cunningham who is breathing frantically her eyes opening and closing
a couple of women are feebly slapping her hands someone else is fanning her face
the senator and guy rush into the picture
they look at the fallen bruno
they search around for an explanation
other man come in ad they start to pick bruno up
converted to pdf by www
bring him this way
guy gives a quick look in direction of mrs
cunningham sees that she is being attended to
anne rushes into the picture
she sees bruno being helped to his feet then turns her attention to mrs
cunningham who has now somewhat recovered
cunningham is helped to the settee
there is a babble of womens voices trying to explain what has happened
thru the babble bring her upstairs
as the two groups pass off in different directions the few people who ran into the scene late are asking the others what the disturbance is
did she faint
i didnt see anything
what happened to him
but one small figure stands in the clear
it is barbara she is still transfixed by what she has seen
her hands are trembling
camera moves slowly in on her
we see that her lips are trembling too and in her eyes frightened tears are welling
her breath is heavy
bruno is stretched out on a settee
he is completely out
his collar and tie are open
two or three of the male guests are just leaving the room
the senator remains behind for a moment with guy
i thought he was a bit weird when he arrived
who is he
i hardly know him sir
get him out of here as soon as you decently can will you
this is a nice item for the gossips
first thing you know theyll be talking about orgies
id better get back
converted to pdf by www
the senator leaves
guy stands over brunos outstretched figure
bruno is now half awake
almost without seeing guy he staggers to his feet and begins to make his way to the door
guy advances and with a sharp thrust pushes bruno back on the settee
bruno looks and sees guy clearly for the first time
i was on a merry go round somewhere
it made me dizzy
guy moves forward and thrusting his hand in brunos open shirt pulls him to his feet
bruno ignores guys violence and remain puzzled
disgusted youre a mad crazy maniac and you ought to be locked up
now will you get out of here and let me alone
but guy guy smashes bruno in the jaw in utter disgust and knocks him back onto the settee
bruno looks up from his sprawled position a dull look in his eye
you shouldnt have done that guy
subsiding come on pull yourself together
do your tie up
bruno staggers to his feet
he fumbles at his collar
as he crosses to him camera moves in to a closer shot
here let me
he fixes brunos shirt and collar together and quickly ties his white bow
bruno stands swaying like a small boy as guy does this

camera pans with them as guy starts to escort bruno from the room
have you got a car here
mumbling drivers outside
they pass trough door into the hallway
one or two of the guests turn their heads as guy takes bruno across to the front door
barbara appears in the hallway coming from the crowded sitting room
she watches the two men go out the front door
bruno and guy going out the front door
the man servant does not close it immediately so we are able to hear the call for mr
she turns her head and looks up the stairs
barbara has not quite recovered from her ordeal
she hurries forward to greet anne who is hurrying down the stairs
camera pans down with anne as she descends the last few steps
barbara enters the picture and the two girls meet at the foot of the stairs

still shaken he looked at me
his hands were on her throat but he was strangling me
aghast how do you mean
he was looking at her first
then he looked over at me
he went into a sort of trance shudders he looked horrible
reflectively he thought he was murdering me
she looks away with growing consciousness of the situation anne why me
what did i have to do with it
anne is extremely concerned and thoughtful
suddenly she gets an idea and with a pat on barbaras arm asks hurriedly do you know where guy is
he went out with that man
anne hurries to the front door and passes through

anne comes out onto the steps and looks around
she stops short as she sees there are cars lined up outside on the street
one limousine is pulling up in the center two figures at the passenger door
one is climbing in
the other is guy
she calls out urgently guy
guy turns and closes the door
the limousine moves off and guy comes toward her
anne comes down the steps and intercepts guy on the sidewalk
she leads him along a few paces and then stops and faces him
anne nods off in the direction of the departed bruno and speaks in a desperate low voice
you didnt meet him for the first time the other day did you guy
guy stares at her for a moment

he is dressed differently having changed from his dinner clothes to a sack suit
there is only one lamp lighted in the room
guy presents a grim picture
converted to pdf by www
he is studying the plan of brunos house and he picks up the key bruno sent along with it
finally he looks at his watch then folds the plan and puts it in his pocket with the key
he rises crosses to the chest of drawers opens the top drawer
guys hands take out the luger
his hand then picks up miriams glasses from the drawer holds them a moment
he is about to put them back then decides to take them along puts them into his pocket
camera pans guy across to the window
he parts the curtains slightly and looks out
hammond is lighting a cigarette as he strolls in front of the house
guy crosses to his door which he opens surreptitiously
guy glances down the stairs then closes the door behind him quietly and moves away to a window at the turn of the stairs
guy comes out of the window onto the second floor fire escape
he creeps stealthily down and emerges into a narrow alleyway
he steps back into the shadows for a moment when he sees the strolling figure of hammond on the far side of the street
converted to pdf by www
guy turns away and is soon lost in the darkness of the street
we are on the inside of the gates
we see them swing open slightly and the figure of guy edges through them
guy leaves the gates ajar and then taking the plan of brunos house from his pocket and the key he looks toward the house
this is a long flight of steps
they are lined with tall black cypress trees which throw their shadows across the steps
guy moves out of one shadow into another and carefully starts up the stairs
he pauses looks about for a moment and listens
then he puts the key into the lock finding it with his flashlight
the door opens a few inches
he turns off the flash and enters
as guy moves in soundlessly and closes the door
he looks toward the stairs which are in shadow
guy starts up the stairs slowly
he carries his flashlight and the plan
a huge shadow lies it the head of the stairs
as guy comes slowly up the stairs the great dane looks down at him
converted to pdf by www
he reacts to the sight of the dog stops an instant and turn on his flashlight
the heavy massive face of the dog looks straight down at him
guy turns off the flashlight and after a moment of indecision starts slowly up the stairs once more the dog watching every step he takes
guy comes up the last few stairs and still the dog hasnt moved
guy slowly edges past him and the great danes head turns to watch him
moving quietly along the hallway approaches two doors
he takes out his flash and identifies the door with his plan
the plan shows two doors in relation to the stairway
the first one is clearly marked my room
the adjoining door is marked my fathers room
he pauses at the first door then passes it quietly walking on to the next one
he turns the knob soundlessly and passes through into the room
the room is in darkness except for the dim outline of the recumbent figure in the bed
we hear guys voice in a loud whisper mr
the figure stirs
guy takes a stop closer to the bed
converted to pdf by www
dont be alarmed but i must talk to you about your son
the figure on the bed turns and a hand stretches out toward a bedside light
the light goes on with a sudden glare
the low camera throws a vast shadow up on the wall behind him creating a grimace of his smile
his face is dead
bruno rises from the bed and sits on the and of it
he is fully dressed just as he was at the party in white tie and tails
politely my father isnt home tonight mr
smiles grimly at guys surprise i was about to tell you that over the phone
but you came to such a sudden decision
i wondered why
recovering quickly since you sent me a key to your house i decided to use it to make a little social call on your father
i thought hed be interested to know he his a lunatic son
the faintest flicker of brunos eyes indicates the intensity of his reaction
he stares hard at guy
converted to pdf by www
then a i correct mr
haines in assuming that you have no intention of going ahead with our arrangement
no intention whatsoever
i never had
you wont have any further use for the key then mr
he holds out his hand and guy gives him the key thank you very such
as bruno continues to stare at him guy takes out the luger
for a moment a look of fear comes into brunos face as he thinks guy will probably shoot him
after a pause guy tosses the gun on the bed
brunos relief turns again to menace
he picks up the gun and fingers it nervously
kindly look bruno
youre terribly sick
haltingly i dont know whether its possible for you to realize it or not
i dont know much about these things bruno
but why dont you go someplace where you can get some treatment
not only for your own sake bruno but you cant go on causing more and more destruction to anyone you happen to meet
bruno pays no attention
guys arguments have made no impression on bruno whatsoever
he fingers the gun
i dont like to be doublecrossed
converted to pdf by www
i have a murder on my conscience but its not my murder mr
haines its yours
and as youre the one to profit i think you should be the one to pay for it
for an instant his nervous hands seem to be struggling with the urge to kill guy
gives up well i guess its no use bruno
we sees to have nothing further to discuss
bruno goes to the door in silent acquiescence and opens it for guy to pass through
guy walks toward the stairs tense and apprehensive
bruno is following him still holding the gun
when the great dane sees bruno it gets to its feet as if waiting for a command
guy starts down the stairs but bruno stays where he is the dog beside him
gay turns and looks back it this tableaux of menace
im not going to shoot you mr
it might disturb mother
with a feeling of power im a very clever follow
ill think of something better than that
bruno remains in the foreground of the scene as guy proceeds on down the stairs
we see him open the front door and pass through

antonys much less serious

i know brunos been in some very awkward scrapes but nothing so ridiculous as a murder
she gives a short little laugh desperately but mrs
antony youve got to make him do something about this
dont you see that just one word from him would extricate guy from this dreadful situation
lightly oh but miss burton im sure this thing must be some practical joke
you know bruno sometimes goes too far
girl to girl of course i shouldnt be saying this to an outsider but sometimes hes terribly irresponsible and gets into all kinds of escapades
but dont you understand mrs

anne is left helpless standing in the middle of the room
she picks up her purse and is about to go when she hears a voice oh miss burton
anne turns back in direction of the voice
camera pulls back until we can see the feet of bruno protruding from behind a chair in which he is sitting
he has obviously heard the entire conversation between anne and his mother
he is in dressing gown and pajamas
im afraid mother wasnt very helpful was she
he strolls toward anne you know she hasnt been well for a long time

shakes his head commiseratingly poor mother
anne is too stunned to speak

she starts to cry in sheer frustration
bruno goes to her sympathetically
miss burton i know how you feel
he puts his hand on her shoulder
anne flings it off
