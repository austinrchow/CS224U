href b b the godfather screenplay by and gulf and western plaza march new york new york the paramount logo is presented austerely over a black background
there is a moments hesitation and then the simple words in white lettering while this remains we hear i believe in america
suddenly we are watching in close view amerigo bonasera a man of sixty dressed in a black suit on the verge of great emotion
america has made my fortune
as he speaks the view imperceptibly begins to loosen
i raised my daughter in the american fashion i gave her freedom but taught her never to dishonor her family
she found a boy friend not an italian
she went to the movies with him stayed out late
two months ago he took her for a drive with another boy friend
they made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her
she resisted she kept her honor
so they beat her like an animal
when i went to the hospital her nose was broken her jaw was shattered and held together by wire and she could not even weep because of the pain
he can barely speak he is weeping now
i went to the police like a good american
these two boys were arrested and brought to trial
the judge sentenced them to three years in prison and suspended the sentence
they went free that very day
i stood in the courtroom like a fool and those bastards they smiled at me
then i said to my wife for justice we must go to the godfather
by now the view is full and we see don corleones office in his home
the blinds are closed and so the room is dark and with patterned shadows
we are watching bonasera over the shoulder of don corleone
tom hagen sits near a small table examining some paperwork and sonny corleone stands impatiently by the window nearest his father sipping from a glass of wine
we can hear music and the laughter and voices of many people outside
bonasera we know each other for years but this is the first time you come to me for help
i dont remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee
even though our wives are friends
what do you want of me
ill give you anything you want but do what i ask
and what is that bonasera
bonasera whispers into the dons ear
you ask for too much
i ask for justice
the court gave you justice
an eye for an eye
but your daughter is still alive
then make them suffer as she suffers
how much shall i pay you
both hagen and sonny react
you never think to protect yourself with real friends
you think its enough to be an american
all right the police protects you there are courts of law so you dont need a friend like me
but now you come to me and say don corleone you must give me justice
and you dont ask in respect or friendship
and you dont think to call me godfather instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder
america has been good to me
then take the justice from the judge the bitter with the sweet bonasera
but if you come to me with your friendship your loyalty then your enemies become my enemies and then believe me they would fear you
slowly bonasera bows his head and murmurs
be my friend
from me youll get justice
some day and that day may never come i would like to call upon you to do me a service in return
a high angle of the corleone mall in bright daylight
there are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard and gardens
there is music and laughing and dancing and countless tables covered with food and wine
don corleone stands at the gate flanked on either side by a son fredo and sonny all dressed in the formal attire of the wedding party
he warmly shakes the hands squeezes the hands of the friends and guests pinches the cheeks of the children and makes them all welcome
they in turn carry with them gallons of homemade wine cartons of freshly baked bread and pastries and enormous trays of italian delicacies
the entire family poses for a family portrait don corleone mama sonny his wife sandra and their children tom hagen and his wife theresa and their baby constanzia the bride
and her bridegroom carlo rizzi
as they move into the pose the don seems preoccupied
hell be here pop its still early
then the picture will wait for him
everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the don moves back to the house
sonny gives a delicious smile in the direction of the maid of honor lucy mancini
she returns it
then he moves to his wife
sandra watch the kids
theyre running wild
you watch yourself
hagen kisses his wife and follows the don passing the wine barrels where a group of four men nervously wait
tom crooks a finger at nazorine who doublechecks that he is next straightens and follows hagen
outside the main gate of the mall several men in suits working together with a man in a dark sedan walk in and out of the rows of parked cars
writing license plate numbers down in their notebooks
we hear the music and laughter coming from the party in the distance
a man stops at a limousine and copies down the number
barzini dignified in a black homburg is always under the watchful eyes of two bodyguards as he makes his way to embrace don corleone in the courtyard
the men walk down another row of parked cars
put another number in the notebook
a shiney new cadillac with wooden bumpers
peter clemenza dancing the tarantella joyously bumping bellies with the ladies
he mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief
paulie hustles gets a glass of icy black wine and brings it to him
you look terrif on the floor
what are you a dance judge
go do your job take a walk around the neighborhood
see everything is okay
paulie nods and leaves clemenza takes a breath and leaps back into the dance
the men walk down another row of parked cars
put another number in the notebook
tessio a tall gentle looking man dances with a nine year old girl her little black party shoes planted on his enormous brown shoes
the men move on to other parked cars when sonny storms out of the gate his face flushed with anger followed by clemenza and paulie
buddy this is a private party
the man doesnt answer but points to the driver of the sedan
sonny menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him
the driver merely flips open his wallet to a greed card without saying a word
sonny steps back spits on the ground turns and walks away followed by clemenza paulie and another two men
he doesnt say a thing for most of the walk back into the courtyard and then muttered to paulie
dont respect nothing
don corleone sits quietly behind his massive desk in the dark study
a fine boy from sicily captured by the american army and sent to new jersey as a prisoner of war
nazorine my friend tell me what i can do
now that the war is over enzo this boy is being repatriated to italy
and you see godfather
he wrings his hands unable to express himself he
you want him to stay in this country
godfather you understand everything
tom what we need is an act of congress to allow enzo to become a citizen
impressed an act of congress
nodding it will cost
the don shrugs such are the way with those things nazorine nods
is that all
godfather thank you
backing out enthusiastically oh wait till you see the cake i made for your beautiful daughter
nazorine backs out all smiles and nods to the godfather
don corleone rises and moves to the venetian blinds
who do i give this job to
the don moves to the windows peeking out through the blinds
not to one of our paisans
give it to a jew congressman in another district
who else is on the list for today
the don is peeking out to the men around the barrel waiting to see him
his nephew has been refused parole
a bad case
nippi waits nervously by the barrel
his father worked with you in the freight yards when you were young
luca brasi sitting alone grotesque and quiet
hes not on the list but luca brasi wants to see you
the don turns to hagen
is it necessary
you understand him better than anyone
the don nods to this
turns back to the blinds and peeks out
michael corleone dressed in the uniform of a marine captain leads kay adams through the wedding crowd occasionally stopped and greeted by friends of the family
the don inside the office peering through the blinds following them
michael moves through the crowd embraces mama and introduces her to his girl
the dons eyes peering through the blinds
kay and michael settle by a table on the edge of the wedding burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine
she is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair the music and the vitality
ive never seen anything like it
i told you i had a lot of relatives
kay looking about a young and lively thing in a gift shop
we see what she sees her interest is caught by three men standing by the wine barrels
amused michael what are those men doing
theyre waiting to see my father
theyre talking to themselves
theyre going to talk to my father which means theyre going to ask him for something which means they better get it right
why do they bother him on a day like this
because they know that no sicilian will refuse a request on his daughters wedding day
connie corleone the bride is pressing the bodice of her overly fluffy white gown against the groom carlo rizzi
he is bronzed with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples
she absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from him long enough to thank the various guests for the white envelopes they are putting into the large white
purse she holds
in fact if we watch carefully we can see that one of her hands is slid under his jacket and into his shirt where she is provocatively rubbing the hair
on his chest
carlo on the other hand has his blue eyes trained on the bulging envelopes and is trying to guess how much cash the things hold
discreetly he moves her hand off of his skin
whispered cut it out connie
the purse looped by a ribbon of silk around connies arm is fat with money
what do you think
a little distance away a young man paulie gatto catches a prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend without once taking eyes from the purse
twenty thirty grand in small bills cash in that silk purse
holy toledo if this was somebody elses wedding
sonny is sitting at the wedding dias talking to lucy mancini the maid of honor
every once in a while he glances across the courtyard where his wife is talking with some women
he bends over and whispers something into lucys ear
sandra and the women are in the middle of a big ribald laugh
is it true what they say about your husband sandra
sandras hands separate with expanding width further and further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter
through her separated hands she sees the wedding dais
sonny and lucy are gone
the empty hallway
the bathroom door opens and lucy surreptitiously steps out
she looks up where sonny is standing on the second landing motioning for her to come up
she lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs
kay and michael
in a spooky low tone michael that scarey guy
is he a relative
she has picked out luca brasi
his name is luca brasi
you wouldnt like him
excited who is he
sizing her up you really want to know
you like spaghetti
you know i love spaghetti
then eat your spaghetti and ill tell you a luca brasi story
she starts to eat her spaghetti
she begins eating looking at him eagerly
once upon a time about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my fathers olive oil business
they had al capone send some men in from chicago to kill my father and they almost did
my father sent luca brasi after them
he tied the two capone men hand and foot and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths
then he took an ax and chopped one mans feet off
then the legs at the knees
michael youre trying to scare me
then the thighs where they joined the torso
michael i dont want to hear anymore
then luca turned to the other man
michael i love you
who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated
the smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a tall story
i never know when youre telling me the truth
i told you you wouldnt like him
hes coming over here
luca comes toward them to meet tom hagen halfway just near their table
tom id like you to meet kay adams
having survived luca how do you do
my brother tom hagen
your fathers inside doing some business
privately hes been asking for you
hagen smiles and moves back to the house luca ominously following
if hes your brother why does he have a different name
my brother sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid so my father took him in
hes a good lawyer
don corleone at the window
he has seen the intimacy of the don corleone
the don turns to the stiffly formal luca and he moves forward to kiss his hand
he takes the envelope from his jacket holds it out but does not release it until he makes a formal speech
with difficulty don corleone
i am honored and grateful
that you invited me to your home
on the wedding day of your
may their first child
be a masculine child
i pledge my never ending loyalty
he offers the envelope for your daughters bridal purse
thank you luca my most valued friend
the don takes it and then lucas hand which he squeezes so tightly we might imagine it to be painful
let me leave you don corleone
i know you are busy
he turns almost an about face and leaves the study with the same formality he entered with
don corleone breathes more easily and gives the thick envelope to hagen
im sure its the most generous gift today
the senator called apologized for not coming personally but said youd understand
also some of the judges
theyve all sent gifts
and another call from virgil sollozzo
don corleone is not pleased
the action is narcotics
sollozzo has contacts in turkey for the poppy in sicily for the plants to process down to morphine or up to heroin
also he has access to this country
hes coming to us for financial help and some sort of immunity from the law
for that we get a piece of the action i couldnt find out how much
sollozzo is vouched for by the tattaglia family and they may have a piece of the action
they call sollozzo the turk
hes spent a lot of time in turkey and is suppose to have a turkish wife and kids
hes suppose to be very quick with the knife or was when he was younger
only in matters of business and with some reasonable complaint
also he has an american wife and three children and he is a good family man
the don nods
hes his own boss and very competent
and with prison record
two terms one in italy one in the united states
hes known to the government as a top narcotics man
that could be a plus for us he could never get immunity to testify
when did he call
on a day like this
consiglero do you also have in your notes the the turk made his living from prostitution before the war like the tattaglias do now
write that down before you forget it
the turk will wait
we now begin to hear a song coming over the loud speakers from outside
in italian with unmistakable style
it sounds like johnny
he moves to the window pulls the blinds up flooding the room with light
it is johnny
he came all the way from california to be at the wedding
should i bring him in
let the people enjoy him
he is a good godson
its been two years
hes probably in trouble again
johnny fontane on the bandstand singing to the delight and excitement of the wedding guests
i didnt know your family knew johnny fontane
i used to come down to new york whenever he sang at the capitol and scream my head off
hes my fathers godson he owes him his whole career
johnny finishes the song and the crowd screams with delight
they call out for another when don corleone appears
my godson has come three thousand miles to do us honor and no one thinks to wet his throat
at once a dozen wine glasses are offered to johnny who takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his godfather
i kept trying to call you after my divorce and tom always said you were busy
when i got the wedding invitation i knew you werent sore at me anymore godfather
can i do something for you still
youre not too rich or too famous that i cant help you
im not rich anymore godfather and
my career im almost washed up
hes very disturbed
the godfather indicates that he come with him to the office so no one will notice
he turns to tell santino to come in with us
he should hear some things
they go leaving hagen scanning the party looking for sonny
hagen glances up the staircase
then he goes up
sonny and lucy are in a room upstairs he has lifted her gowns skirts almost over her head and has her standing against the door
her face peeks out from the layers of petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy
her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his body
but there is a knocking as well
they stop freeze in that position
sonny you in there
outside hagen by the door
the old man wants you johnnys here
hes got a problem
we hear lucys head bouncing against the door again
act like a man
by christ in heaven is it possible you turned out no better than a hollywood finocchio
both hagen and johnny cannot refrain from laughing
the don smiles
sonny enters as noiselessly as possible still adjusting his clothes
all right hollywood
now tell me about this hollywood pezzonovanta who wont let you work
he owns the studio
just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book a best seller
and the main character is a guy just like me
i wouldnt even have to act just be myself
the don is silent stern
you take care of your family
he glances at sonny who makes himself as inconspicuous as he can
you look terrible
i want you to eat well to rest
and spend time with your family
and then at the end of the month this big shot will give you the part you want
its too late
all the contracts have been signed theyre almost ready to shoot
ill make him an offer he cant refuse
he takes johnny to the door pinching his cheek hard enough to hurt
now go back to the party and leave it to me
he closes the door smiling to himself
turns to hagen
when does my daughter leave with her bridegroom
theyll cut the cake in a few minutes
leave right after that
your new son in law do we give him something important
no give him a living
but never let him know the familys business
what else tom
ive called the hospital theyve notified consiglere gencos family to come and wait
he wont last out the night
this saddens the don
genco will wait for me
santino tell your brothers they will come with me to the hospital to see genco
tell fredo to drive the big car and ask johnny to come with us
all my sons
to hagen tom i want you to go to california tonight
make the arrangements
but dont leave until i come back from the hospital and speak to you
now all the wedding guests excitedly clap their hands over the entrance of the cake nazorine is beaming as he wheels in a serving table containing the biggest gaudiest most
extravagant wedding cake ever baked an incredible monument of his gratitude
the crowd is favorably impressed they begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses in the traditional request for the bride to cut the cake and kiss the
louder and louder five hundred forks hitting five hundred glasses
high angle on the mall late day
the guests are gone
a single black car is in the courtyard
freddie is behind the drivers seat the don enters the car looks at michael who sits between sonny and johnny in the rear seat
will your girl friend get back to the city all right
tom said hed take care of it
the don pulls the door shut and the car pulls out through the gate of the great corleone mall
a long white hospital corridor at the end of which we can see a grouping of five women some old and some young but all plump and dressed in black
don corleone and his sons move toward the end
but then the don slows putting his hand on michaels shoulder
michael stops and turns toward his father
the two looks at one another for some time
don corleone then lifts his hand and slowly touches a particular medal on michaels uniform
what was this for
for killing a man
what miracles you do for strangers
i fought for my country
it was my choice
and now what do you choose to do
im going to finish school
when you are finished come and talk to me
i have hopes for you
again they regard each other without a word
michael turns and continues on
don corleone watches a moment and then follows
don corleone enters the hospital room moving closest to our view
he is followed by his sons johnny and the women
whispered genco ive brought my sons to pay their respects
and look even johnny fontane all the way from hollywood
genco is a tiny wasted skeleton of a man
don corleone takes his bony hand as the others arrange themselves around his bed each clasping the other hand in turn
godfather godfather its your daughters wedding day you cannot refuse me
cure me you have the power
i have no such power
but genco dont fear death
with a sly wink its been arranged then
you need your old consigliere
who will replace me
suddenly stay with me godfather
help me meet death
if he sees you he will be frightened and leave me in peace
you can say a word pull a few strings eh
well outwit that bastard as we outwitted all those others
clutching his hand godfather dont betray me
the don motions all the others to leave the room
he returns his attention to genco holding his hand and whispering things we cannot hear as they wait for death
the interior of a non stop constellation
hagen is one of the very few passengers on this late flight
he looks like any young lawyer on a business trip
he is tired from the difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed during the wedding
on the seat next to him is an enormous bulging briefcase
he closes his eyes
the honeymoon hotel carlo and connie
carlo is in his undershorts sitting up on the bed anxiously taking the envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the contents
connie prepares herself in the large marble bathroom
she rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders and tries to get his interest
don corleone in his office
luca brasi sitting near to him
luca i am worried about this man sollozzo
find out what you can through the tattaglias
let them believe you could be tempted away from the corleone family if the right offer was made
learn what he has under his fingernails
the hallway of an apartment building
sonny enters climbs two steps at a time
he knocks and then whispers
its me sonny
the door opens and two lovely arms are around him pulling him into the apartment
luca brasis tiny room
he is partly dressed
he kneels and reaches under his bed and pulls out a small locked trunk
he opens it and takes out a heavy bullet proof vest
he puts it on over his wool undershirt and then puts on his shirt and jacket
he takes his gun quickly disassembles checks and reassembles it
a close view of don corleone thinking quietly
michael and kay on a train speeding on their way to new hampshire
luca in his bulky jacket sitting quietly on an empty subway train
hagen on the constellation
he reaches into his briefcase and takes out several pictures and papers
one photograph is of a smiling man jack woltz linked arm in arm with fifteen movie stars on either side including a lovely young child star to his immediate right
hagen considers other papers
don corleone looks and then moves hagen into an embrace
he straightens his arms and looks at tom deeply
remember my new consigliere a lawyer with his briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns
jack woltz estate
hagen stands before the impressive gate armed only with his briefcase
a gateman opens the gate and tom enters
hagen and woltz comfortably stroll along beautiful formal gardens martinis in hand
you should have told me your boss was corleone tom i had to check you out
i thought you were just some third rate hustler johnny was running in to bluff me
a piece of statuary florence thirteenth century
decorated the garden of a king
they cross the garden and head toward the stables
im going to show you something beautiful
they pass the stables and come to rest by a stall with a huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall khartoum
two security guards are positioned in chairs nearby they rise as woltz approaches
you like horses
i like horses i love em
beautiful expensive racehorses
the animal inside is truly beautiful
woltz whispers to him with true love in his voice
you are looking at six hundred thousand dollars on four hoofs
i bet even russian czars never paid that kind of dough for a single horse
but im not going to race him im going to put him out to stud
hagen and woltz sit at an enormous dining room table attended by several servants
great paintings hang on the walls
the meal is elaborate and sumptuous
corleone is johnnys godfather
that is very close a very sacred religious relationship
okay but just tell him this is one favor i cant give
but he should try me again on anything else
he never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first
you smooth son of a bitch let me lay it on the line for you and your boss
johnny fontane never gets that movie
i dont care how many dago guinea wop greaseball goombahs come out of the woodwork
im german irish
okay my kraut mick friend johnny will never get that part because i hate that pinko punk and im going to run him out of the movies
and ill tell you why
he ruined one of woltz brothers most valuable proteges
for five years i had this girl under training singing lessons
we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars i was going to make her a star
ill be even more frank just to show you that im not a hard hearted man that it wasnt all dollars and cents
that girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass ive ever ad and ive had them all over the world
then johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off
she threw it all away to make me look ridiculous
a man in an unimposing little building in new york city on mott street with a large old sign genco olive oil imports inc
next to an open faced fruit market
a dark buick pulls up and a single small man whom we cannot see well because of the distance gets out and enters the building
this is virgil sollozzo
looking toward the staircase we can hear sollozzos footsteps before he actually rises into view
he is a small man very dark with curly black hair
but wiry and tight and hard and obviously very dangerous
he is greeted at the head of the stairs by sonny who takes his hand and shakes it introducing himself
for a moment there is a complex of handshaking quite formal and whispered respectful introductions
finally sollozzo is taken into the dons glass paneled office the two principals are introduced
they are very respectful of one another
folding chairs are brought in by freddie and soon they are all sitting around in a circle the don sollozzo sonny hagen freddie clemenza and tessio
the don is the slightest bit foolish with all his compatriots whereas sollozzo has brought no one
throughout all that transpires however it is clear that this scene is between two men sollozzo and don corleone
my business is heroin i have poppy fields laboratories in narseilles and sicily ready to go into production
my importing methods are as safe as these things can be about five per cent loss
the risk is nothing the profits enormous
why do you come to me
why do i deserve your generosity
i need two million dollars in cash
more important i need a friend who has people in high places a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested they would get only light
be my friend
what percentages for my family
thirty per cent
in the first year your share would be four million dollars then it would go up
and what is the percentage of the tattaglia family
sollozzo nods toward hagen
ill take care of them from my share
i receive per cent just for finance and legal protection
no worries about operations is that what you tell me
if you think two million dollars in cash is just finance i congratulate you don corleone
there is a long silence in which each person present feels the tension
the don is about to give his answer
i said i would see you because ive heard youre a serious man to be treated with respect
pause but ill say no to you
we feel this around the room
ill give you my reasons
i have many many friends in politics
but they wouldnt be so friendly if my business was narcotics instead of gambling
they think gambling is something like liquor a harmless vice
and they think narcotics is dirty business
sollozzo takes a breath
how a man makes his living is none of my business
but this proposition of yours is too risky
all the people in my family lived well the last ten years i wont risk that out of greed
are you worried about security for your million
the tattaglias will guarantee your investment also
this startles sonny he blurts out
the tattaglia family guarantees our investment
sollozzo hears him first and then very slowly turns to face him
everyone is the room knows that sonny has stepped out of line
young people are greedy and they have no manners
they speak when they should listen
but i have a sentimental weakness for my children and ive spoiled them as you see
but signor sollozzo my no is final
sollozzo nods understands that this is the dismissal
he glances one last time at sonny
he rises all the others do as well
he bows to the don shakes his hand and formally takes his leave
when the footsteps can no longer be heard the don turns to sonny
santino never let anyone outside the family know what you are thinking
i think your brain is going soft from all that comedy you play with that young girl
two office workers are carrying an enormous floral display with the word thank you spelled out in flowers
what is this nonsense
its from johnny
it was announced this morning
hes going to play the lead in the new woltz brothers film
it is large dominated by a huge bed in which a man presumably woltz is sleeping
soft light bathes the room from the large windows
we move closer to him until we see his face and recognize jack woltz
he turns uncomfortably mutters feels something strange in his bedsheets
he wakens feels the sheets with displeasure they are wet
he looks at his hand the wetness is blood
he is frightened pulls aside the covers and sees fresh blood on his sheets and pajamas
he grunts pulls the puddle of blood in his bed
he feels his own body frantically moving down following the blood until he is face to face with the great severed head of khartoum lying at the foot of his
just blood from the hacked neck
white reedy tendons show
he struggles up to his elbows in the puddle of blood to see more clearly
froth covers the muzzle and the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered with blood
woltz tries to scream but cannot
no sound comes out
then finally and suddenly an ear splitting scream of pure terror escapes from woltz who is rocking on his hands and knees in an uncontrolled fit blood all over him
close view on the godfather
send johnny my congratulations
fifth avenue in the snow
people are bundled up with rosy faces rushing to buy presents
kay and michael exit a fifth avenue department store carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts arm in arm
we have something for your mother for sonny we have the tie for fredo and tom hagen gets the reynolds pen
and what do you want for christmas
close on a wooden radio playing quiet music
the view pans around the dark hotel room curtained against the daylight

the two are in each others arms in a mess of bedsheets on the two single beds that they have pushed together

she hands the phone to michael who continues the deception

hagen in the olive oil company office
in the background through the glass partitions we can see the don at work in his office
tom is tired and steeped in paperwork

michael has hung up
he looks at the piles of work and cant face it
he rises puts on his coat and hat and continues out
he peeks into the dons office
michael called hes not leaving new hampshire until tomorrow morning
ive got to go i promised theresa id pick up some toys for the kids
the don smiles and nods
tom smiles and leaves our view remaining with don corleone
freddie is sitting on a bench in the corner reading the afternoon paper
he puts aside the papers the office manager has prepared for him and then moves to freddie raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the
tell paulie to get the car from the lot ill be ready to go home in a few minutes
ill have to get it myself paulie called in sick this morning
thats the third time this month
i think maybe youd better get a healthier bodyguard for me

if hes sick hes sick
i dont mind getting the car
he slowly puts on his jacket
looks out his window
freddie crosses the street
buon watale don corleone
the manager helps him on with his overcoat
once again the don glances out his window
the black car pulls up freddie driving
handing the manager an envelope and he starts down the stairs
the light outside is very cold and beginning to fail
when freddie sees his father coming he moves back into the drivers seat
the don moves to the car and is about to get in when he hesitates and turns back to the long open fruit stand near the corner
the proprietor springs to serve him
the don walks among the trays and baskets and merely points to a particular piece of fruit
as he selects the man gingerly picks the pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag
the don pays with a five dollar bill waits for his change and then turns back to the car
tom hagen exits carrying a stack of presents all gift wrapped
he continues past the windows
as he walks someone walks right in his way
he looks up
it is sollozzo
he takes tom by the arm and walks along with him
quietly dont be frightened
i just want to talk to you
a car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open
urgently get in i want to talk to you
hagen pulls his arm free
he is frightened
i havent got time
two men suddenly appear on either side of him
get in the car
if i wanted to kill you youd be dead already
hagen sick to his stomach moves with his escorts leaving our view on the mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story of hansel and gretel
we hear the car doors shut and the car drive off
radio city music hall during the christmas show
kay and michael exit tears are still streaming down her cheeks and she sniffles and dries her tears with kleenex
kay nostalgically hums the bells of saint marys as they walk arm in arm
would you like me better if i were a nun
would you like me better if i were ingrid bergman
they have passed a little enclosed newsstand
kay sees something that terrifies her
she doesnt know what to do
michael still walks thinking about her question
a little voice michael
im thinking about it
no i would not like you better if you were ingrid bergman
she cannot answer him
rather she pulls him by the arm back to the newsstand and points
his face goes grave
the headlines read vito corleone shot chieftan gunned michael is petrified quickly he takes each edition drops a dollar in the tray and hungrily reads through them
kay knows to remain silent
desperately they dont say if hes dead or alive
don corleone by the fruit stand he is about to move to the car when two men step from the corner
suddenly the don drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness toward the parked car
the paper bag has hit the ground and the fruit begins rolling along the sidewalk as we hear gunshots
five bullets catch the don in the back he arches in pain and continues toward the car
the proprietor of the fruit stand rushes for cover knocking over an entire case of fruit
the two gunmen move in quickly anxious to finish him off
their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit
there are more gunshots
freddie is hysterical he tries to get out of the car having difficulty opening the door
he rushes out a gun trembling in his hand his mouth open
he actually drops the gun
the gun falls amid the rolling fruit
the gunmen are panicked
they fire once more at the downed don corleone
his leg and arm twitch where they are hit and pools of blood are beginning to form
the gunmen are obviously in a state of panic and confusion they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came
the people about the avenue have all but disappeared rather we catch glimpses of them poking their heads safely from around corners inside doorways and arches and from windows
but the street itself is now empty
freddie is in shock he looks at his father now great puddles of blood have formed and the don is lifeless and face down in them
freddie falls back on to the curb and sits there saying something we cannot understand
he begins to weep profusely
luca brasi riding alone on a subway car late at night
he gets off
he emerges at a subway terminal proceeds out
luca walks down the late night street
he approaches an elegant new york nightclub whose gaudy neon sign is still winking this late at night
he waits and watches
then the sign goes out and he proceeds into the club
the main floor of the nightclub is very large with endless glistening wooden floors
now at this late time the chairs have been stacked on the tables and a negro janitor is waxing them
a single hat check girl is counting her receipts
luca moves past the empty bandstand and sits at the bar
another man dark and very well built moves behind the bar
im bruno tattaglia
luca looks up and out of the shadows emerges sollozzo
do you know who i am
youve been talking to the tattaglias
they thought we could do business
i need somebody strong to protect my operation physically
ive heard youre not happy with your family you might make a switch
if the money is good enough
on the first shipment i can guarantee you fifty thousand dollars
luca looks at him he had no idea the offer would be so good
sollozzo extends his hand but luca pretends not to see it rather he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth
bruno tattaglia behind the bar makes a cigarette lighter magically appear and holds it to lucas cigarette
then he does an odd thing he drops the lighter on the bar and puts his hand lightly on lucas almost patting it
the telephone in sonnys house is ringing
he approaches it obviously fresh from a nap
do you recognize my voice
i think so
dont say my name just listen
somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago
is he alive
i think so but i cant get close enough
theres a lot of blood
ill try to find out more
find out anything you can
you got a grand coming
click sonny cradles the phone
an incredible rage builds up in him his face actually turning red
he would like to rip the phone to pieces in his bare hands
then he controls it
quickly he dials another number
theresa let me talk to tom
have him call me as soon as he gets home
he hangs up
sonny who is it
she enters the room what is it
calmly they shot the old man
nothing else is going to happen
there is a pounding on the door
a baby starts crying
really frightened sonny reaches into a cabinet drawer takes out a gun and moves quickly
he opens the front door quickly
it is clemenza
he enters sonny closes the door
sandra goes to look after the baby
excited you heard about your father
the word is out in the streets that hes dead
where the hell was paulie why wasnt he with the don
paulies been a little sick all winter
he was home
how many times did he stay home the last couple of months
maybe three four times
i always asked freddie if he wanted another bodyguard but he said no
things have been so smooth the last ten years
go get paulie i dont care how sick he is
pick him up yourself and bring him to my fathers house
dont you want me to send some people over here
no just you and paulie
clemenza leaves sonny moves to sandra who sits on the couch weeping quietly comforting her baby
a couple of our people will come to stay here
do whatever they say im going over to the main house
if you want me use pops special phone
the telephone rings again
sonny answers it
sandra moves behind him anxious to know who it is
sonny indicates that she be quiet
we have tom hagen
in about three hours hell be released with our proposition
dont do anything until youve heard what he has to say
you can only cause a lot of trouble
whats done is done
a pause dont lose that famous temper of yours
quietly ill wait
full view of the corleone mall
it is night but the courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the tops of all the houses
it is very cold
we see the figure of sonny cross the mall and let himself into the main house
sonny walks into the empty darkened house
then he calls out
ma where are you
the kitchen door swings open
he moves quickly and takes her by the arm
he is deliberately calm
ma i just got a call
i dont know how bad
have they killed him
almost in tears we dont know yet ma
ill get dressed
in case we can see him
she moves out of the kitchen and continues upstairs
sonny turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying
he takes some bread without thinking and dips it in the oil and sloppily eats some of the peppers as he moves into his fathers office
he switches the lights on in the dons office
the massive desk dominates the room
sonny moves quickly to the telephone pulling a small chair to the side of the desk and dials a number
this is santino corleone
i want fifty reliable men out here
i heard sonny
but what about clemenzas regime
i dont want to use clemenzas people right now
he hangs up
he moves quickly to a wall safe operates the dial and removes a small notebook
he takes it back to the desk and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger
we follow the names until the finger stops at one luca brasi
sonny dials the number
there is no answer
the interior of an abandoned building
several men in suits and ties sit around in the booths
hagen sits in one sollozzo sits across from him
i know youre not in the muscle end of the family so i dont want you to be afraid
i want you to help the corleones and i want you to help me
hagens hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette in his mouth
one of the button men brings a bottle of rye to the table and pours a little into a delicate flowered china cup
hagen sips gratefully
your boss is dead
hagen is overwhelmed actual tears spring to his eyes
sollozzo pauses respectfully
pushing the bottle have some more
we got him outside his office just before i picked you up
you have to make the peace between me and santino
hagen still is focused on the grief of losing the old man
sonny was hot for my deal right
you know its the smart thing to do too
i want you to talk sonny into it
pulling himself together sonny will come after you with everything hes got
sollozzo rises impatiently
thats going to be his first reaction
you have to talk some sense into him
the tattaglia family stands behind me with all their people
the other new york families will go along with anything that prevents a full scale war
he leans close to hagen
the don was slipping in the old days i could never have gotten to him
now hes dead nothing can bring him back
talk to sonny talk to the caporegimes clemenza and tessio
its good business
even sonny wont be able to call off luca brasi
ill worry about luca
you take care of sonny and the other two kids
its what the don would want us to do
lifting his hands in an expression of harmlessness good
then you can go
he escorts him to the door i dont like violence
im a businessman and blood is a big expense
he opens the door they step out together
hagen sollozzo exit
but a car pulls up and one of sollozzos men rushes out
he indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to sollozzo in private
then sollozzo moves with a grave expression
he opens the door indicating that hagen should be led back in
the old man is still alive
five bullets in his sicilian hide and hes still alive
he gives a fatalistic shrug bad luck for me bad luck for you
michael driving during the night
there is a little fog in the air and moisture has formed on the windshield making it difficult to see well
the wipers move across the view as the gate of the corleone mall appears before us still decorated for christmas
the courtyard is bathed with white floodlight giving this place a cold and isolated look
the narrow entrance mouth of the mall is sealed off with a link chain
there are strange cars parked along the curving cement walk
several men are congregated about the gate and chain one of them approaches michaels car
another peeks his ugly face almost right up to michael and then turns
its the dons kid take the car ill bring him inside
the first man opens the car door and michael steps out
the hallway of the main house is filled with men michael doesnt recognize
they pay little attention to him
most of them are waiting sitting uncomfortably no one is talking
michael moves into the living room there is a christmas tree and countless greeting cards taped to the walls
theresa hagen is sitting stiffly on the sofa smoking a cigarette on the coffee table in front of her is a water glass half filled with whiskey
on the other side of the sofa sits clemenza his face is impassive but he is sweating and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black with his saliva
paulie gatto sits tensely and alone on the other side of the room
clemenza sees michael looks up at him
your mothers at the hospital with the old man hes gonna pull through
michael nods his relief
he moves to theresa
gently you heard from tom yet
without looking up she clings to him for a moment and trembles
occasionally strange men will cross through the room everyone speaks in a whisper
taking her hand cmon
he leads her into his fathers office without knocking
sonny and tessio are huddled around a yellow pad
they look up startled
dont worry theresa they just want to give tom the proposition then theyre going to turn him loose
he reassuringly hugs theresa and then to michaels surprise he kisses him on the cheek
i was worried when we couldnt get in touch with you in that hick town
shes been through it before
you were too young to know about it
you better wait outside therere some things you shouldnt hear
i can help you out
oh no you cant the old mand be sore as hell if i let you get mixed up in this
jesus christ hes my father sonny
she understands and leaves them alone
all right mikey
who do we have to hit clemenza or paulie
one of them fingered the old man
michael didnt realize that the men waiting outside were on trial for their lives
no i dont believe it
youre right kid clemenza is okay
it was paulie
how can you be sure
on the three days paulie was sick this month he got calls from a payphone across from the old mans building
we got people in the phone company
he shrugs thank god it was paulie
well need clemenza bad
michael is just realizing the gravity and extent of the situation
is it going to be all out war like last time
until the old man tells me different
then wait sonny
talk to pop
sollozzo is a dead man i dont care what it costs
i dont care if we have to fight all the five families in new york
the tattaglia familys going to eat dirt
i dont care if we all go down together
softly thats not how pop would have played it
i know im not the man he was
but ill tell you this and hell tell you too
when it comes to real action i can operate as good as anybody short range
calmly all right sonny
christ if i could only contact luca
is it like they say
is he that good
outside we hear theresa cry out almost a scream of relief
then open the door and rush out
everyone is standing in the doorway tom hagen is wrapped in a tight embrace with his wife
if i plead before the supreme court ill never do better than i did tonight with that turk
the windows of the main house are dark except for the dons study
it stands out against the cold dark night
the living room is empty save for paulie gatto sitting on the edge of the sofa
the clock reads a
sonny michael hagen clemenza and tessio all exhausted in shirtsleeves about to fall asleep
it is four in the morning there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many snacks
they can barely talk anymore
is the hospital covered
the cops have it locked in and i got my people there visiting pop all the time
what about the hit list
hagen widens his sleepy eyes and looks at the yellow pad
too much too far too personal
the don would consider this all purely a business dispute get rid of sollozzo and everything falls in line
you dont have to go after the tattaglias
what about luca
sollozzo didnt seem worried about luca
that worries me
if luca sold out were in real trouble
has anyone been able to get in touch with him
no and ive been calling all night
maybe hes shacked up
luca never sleeps over with a broad
he always goes home when hes through
mike keep ringing lucas number
michael very tired picks up the phone and dials the number once again
he can hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one answers
then hangs up
keep trying every fifteen minutes
exhausted tom youre the consigliere what do we do if the old man dies
without your fathers political contacts and personal influence the corleone family loses half its strength
without your father the other new york families might wind up supporting sollozzo and the tattaglias just to make sure there isnt a long destructive war
the old days are over this is nobody wants bloodshed anymore
if your father dies
make the deal sonny
angry thats easy to say its not your father
quietly i was as good a son to him as you or mike
oh christ tom i didnt mean it that way
were all tired
ok we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead
but tom i want you to stay inside the mall
you too mike no chances
tessio you hold your people in reserve but have them nosing around the city
the hospital is yours i want it tight fool proof hours a day
there is a timid knock on the door
what is it
paulie gatto looks in
i tol you to stay put paulie
the guy at the gates outside
says theres a package
tessio see what it is
tessio gets up leaves
you want me to hang around
he closes the door
you take care of paulie
i dont ever want to see him again
okay now you can move your men into the mall replace tessios people
mike tomorrow you take a couple of clemenzas people and go to lucas apartment and wait for him to show
that crazy bastard might be going after sollozzo right now if hes heard the news
maybe mike shouldnt get mixed up in this so directly
you know the old man doesnt want that
ok forget it just stay on the phone
michael is embarrassed to be so protected
he dials luca brasis number once again
the ring repeats but no one answers
tessio comes back carrying luca brasis bullet proof vest in his hand
he unwraps it there is a large fish wrapped inside
a sicilian message luca brasi sleeps with the fishes
luca sits at the bar of the tattaglia nightclub as we remember him
bruno tattaglia had just patted his hand
luca looks up at him
then sollozzo pats the other hand almost affectionately
luca is just about to twist his hands away when they both clamp down as hard as they can
suddenly a garrote is thrown around his neck and pulled violently tight
his face begins to turn to purple blotches and then totally purple right before our eyes his tongue hangs out in a far more extreme way than a normal tongue
his eyes bulge
one of the men looks down at him in disgust as lucas strength leaves him
making an ugly face oh christ
all over the floor
sollozzo lets lucas hand go with a victorious smile on his face
luca falls to the floor
the godfather is next
morning in a simple brooklyn suburb
there are rows of pleasant houses driveway after driveway down the block
a dark somber young man of thirty one or two walks with a noticeable limp down the sidewalk and rings the bell
this is rocco lampone
the woman of the house mrs
clemenza talks to him through the screen door and then points to the side of the house
rocco moves to the garage which is specially heated and in which clemenza is busy at work washing a shiny brand new lincoln
lampone admires the car
crazy detroit delivered it with a wooden bumper
theyre going to send me the chrome bumpers in a couple months
i waited two years for this car to come with wooden bumpers
he scrubs and polishes with great affection
today you make your bones on paulie
you understand everything
as he scrubs around the glove compartment he opens it unwraps a gun and gives it to lampone
soft nosed load
accurate up to five feet
lampone expertly puts the gun away
gattos car pulls into the driveway and he sounds the horn
the two men walk to the car
gatto is driving a bit nervous like he doesnt know what is up
lampone gets in the rear seat clemenza in the front making a grunt of recognition
he looks at his wristwatch as though wanting to chide paulie for being late
paulie flinches a little when he sees lampone will ride behind him he half turns rocco sit on the other side
a big guy like you blocks my rearview mirror
clemenza turns sourly to paulie
hes running scared
hes already thinking of going to the mattresses
we have to find a place on the west side
paulie you know a good location
paulie relaxes a bit he thinks hes off any possible hook he was on
also theres the money he can make by selling sollozzo any secret location
ill think about it
grunting drive while you thinking i wanna get to the city this month
the car pulls out
inside paulie drives and clemenza sits in a grump
our view does not show lampone in the rear seat
the car crosses to the midtown tunnel in the late winter light
inside the tunnel gatto doesnt like not seeing lampone
he tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of him
the car is parked in the city
paulie comes down from an available apartment and gets back into the car
good for ten men
ok go to arthur avenue im suppose to call when i found somethin
the car pulls off
new part of the city the car pulls up in a parking lot
clemenza get outs glances at lampone then to paulie
you wait ill call
he walks tucking his shirt into his pants around the corner and enters the luna restaurant
clemenza enters the little restaurant sits down at a table
the waiters know him immediately put a bottle of wine some bread and then a plate of veal on his table
clemenza exits the restaurant belches adjusts his pants he is well fed
we move with him around the corner not knowing what to expect has happened to paulie
there is the car paulie is still sitting behind the wheel lampone in the rear seat
clemenza steps in
he talked my ear off
want us to go back to long beach have another job for us
rocco you live in the city can we drop you off
ah i left my car at your place
ok then you gotta come back
the car pulls out
by now paulie is completely relaxed and secure
you think well go for that last place
maybe or you gotta know now
holy cow i dont gotta know nothing
the car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway
inside clemenza turns to paulie
paulie pull over
i gotta take a leak
the car pulls off the causeway into the reeds
clemenza steps out of the car our view moving with him
he turns his back three quarters from us we can no longer see the car unzips and we hear the sound of urine hitting the ground
we wait on this for a moment and then there are two gunshots
clemenza finishes his leak zips up and turns moving back to the car
paulie is dead bleeding from the mouth the windows behind him are shattered
leave the gun
lampone gets out the two men walk through the reeds a few feet where there is another car
they get in and drive off
high angle of the mall
it is late afternoon
many strange cars are parked on the nearby streets
we can see the group of button men stationed here and there obviously sentries with concealed weapons
michael walks along in the rear yard
he is bundled in a warm marine coat
he looks at the strange men regarding them with an uncertain awe
they look back at him at first suspiciously and then with the respect of his position
he is like an exile prince
he wanders past them and hesitates and looks at the yard
a rusted set of garden swings and other home playground equipment
the basketball ring now half coming off
this is where he was a child
then a shout
hey mikey telephone
clemenza had shouted from the kitchen window
michael hurries into the house
clemenza is in the kitchen cooking over an enormous pot
he points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the hook
michael picks it up
how is your father
hell be ok
pause i love you
he glances at the thugs in the kitchen
tries to shield the phone
yeah kay im here
can you say it
tell me you love me
michael glances at the hoods at the kitchen table
he curls up in a corner and in a quarter voice i cant
please say it
ill see you tonight ok
click clemenza is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all the button men stationed around the house
how come you dont tell that nice girl you love her
here learn something
you may have to feed fifty guys some day
you start with olive oil
fry some garlic see
and then fry some sausage
or meat balls if you like
then you throw in the tomatoes the tomato paste
some basil and a little red wine
thats my trick
sonny peeks into the kitchen sees clemenza
you take care of paulie
you wont see paulie anymore
hes sick for good this winter
michael starts to leave
where are you going
to the city
to clemenza dipping bread into the sauce send some bodyguards
i dont need them sonny
im just going to see pop in the hospital
also i got other things
sollozzo knows mikes a civilian
ok but be careful
michael sits in the rear seat calmly as he is being driven into the city
three buttonmen are crowded into the front seat
michael crosses the lobby past lines of servicemen trying to book rooms
michael and kay eating a quiet dinner at the hotel
he is preoccupied shes concerned
visiting hour ends at eight thirty
ill just sit with him i want to show respect
can i go to the hospital with you
i dont think so
you dont want to end up on page of the daily news
my parents dont read the daily news
all right if you think i shouldnt
i cant believe the things the papers are printing
im sure most of its not true
i dont think so either
silence i better go
when will i see you again
i want you to go back to new hampshire
think things over
he leans over her kisses her
when will i see you again
quietly he moves out the door
kay lies on the bed a while and then to herself goodbye
a taxi pulls up in front of a hospital marked clearly with a neon sign hospital emergency
michael steps out pays the fare
and then stops dead in his tracks
he sees the hospital in the night but it is deserted
he is the only one on the street
there are gay twinkling christmas decorations all over the building
he walks slowly at first and then ever so quickly up the steps
he hesitates looks around
this area is empty
he checks the address on a scrap of paper
it is correct
he tries the door it is empty
he walks in
michael stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital lobby
he looks to the right there is a long empty corridor
to the left the same
high full angle as michael walks through the desolated building lit by eerie green neon lighting
all we hear are his sole footsteps
he walks up to a desk marked information
no one is there
he moves quickly to a door marked office swings into it no one is there
he looks onto the desk there is half a sandwich and a half filled bottle of coke
now he knows something is happening he moves quickly alertly
michael walking down the hospital corridors all alone
the floors have just been mopped
they are still wet
now he turns onto a staircase ever quickening up several flights
he steps out onto the fourth floor
there are merely empty corridors
he takes out his scrap of paper checks it
now he hurries trying to follow the code of hospital rooms following the right arrows quicker and quicker they flash by him
now he stops looks up a corleone
there is a special card table set up there with some magazines
and some smoking cigarettes still in the ashtray but no detectives no police no bodyguards
slowly he pushes the door open almost afraid at what he will find
lit by the moonlight through the window he can see a figure in the hospital bed alone in the room and under a transparent oxygen tent
all that can be heard is the steady though strained breathing
slowly michael walks up to it and is relieved to see his father securely asleep
tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the bed and run to his nose and mouth
what are you doing here
this startles michael who almost jumps around
it is a nurse lit from the light behind her in the hallway
youre not supposed to be here now
michael calms himself and moves to her
im michael corleone this is my father
what happened to the detectives who were guarding him
oh your father just had too many visitors
it interfered with the hospital service
the police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago
comfortingly but dont worry
i look in on him
you just stand here one minute
quickly he moves to the telephone dials a number
sonny jesus christ im down at the hospital
i came down late
theres no one here
none of tessios people no detectives no one
the old man is completely unprotected
all right get him in a different room lock the door from the inside
ill have some men there inside of fifteen minutes
sit tight and dont panic
furiously but kept inside i wont panic
he hangs up returns to the nurse
you cannot stay here
coldly you and i are going to move my father right now
to another room on another floor
can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out
we have to get permission from the doctor
youve read about my father in the papers
youve seen that no ones here to guard him
now ive just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him
believe me and help me
frightened we dont have to disconnect them we can wheel the stand with the bed
she does so
and they perform the very difficult task of moving the bed and the apparatus out of the room
they roll the bed the stand and all the tubes silently down the corridor
we hear footsteps coming up the stairs
michael hears them stops
hurry into there
they push it into the first available room
michael peeks out from the door
the footsteps are louder then they emerge
it is enzo nazorines helper carrying a bouquet of flowers
stepping out who is it
do you remember me enzo the bakers helper to nazorine now his son in law
enzo get out of here
theres going to be trouble
a look of fear sweeps through enzos face
will be trouble
i stay with you to help
i owe it to the godfather
michael thinks realizes he needs all the help he can get
go outside stand in front
ill be out in a minute
michael moves into the hospital room where they put his father
frightened hes awake
michael looks at the old man his eyes are open though he cannot speak
michael touches his face tenderly
pop its me michael
shhhh dont try to speak
there are men who are coming to try to kill you
but im with you
im with you now
the old man tries to speak
michael tenderly puts his finger to his fathers lips
outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous enzo pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only weapon
michael exits the hospital and moves to him
they both stand under a lamppost in the cold december night
they are both frightened michael gives enzo a cigarette lights it
enzos hands are trembling michaels are not
get rid of those and look like youve got a gun in your pocket
the windows of the hospital twinkle with christmas decorations
we hear the sound of a single automobile coming
michael and enzo look with fear in their eyes
then michael takes the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket
they stand hands in their pockets
a long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them
michaels and enzos faces are tough impassive
the car seems as though it will stop and then quickly accelerates
michael and enzo are relieved
michael looks down the bakers hands are shaking
he looks at his own and they are not
another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of police sirens
they are clearly coming toward the hospital getting louder and louder
michael heaves a sigh of relief
in a second a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of the hospital then two more squad cars follow with uniformed police and detectives
he smiles his relief and starts toward them
two huge burly policemen suddenly grab his arms while another frisks him
a massive police captain spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat with beefy red face and white hair seems furious
this is mccluskey
i thought i got all you guinea hoods locked up
who the hell are you and what are you doing here
another cop standing nearby hes clean captain
michael studies mccluskey closely
quietly what happened to the detectives who were supposed to be guarding my father
furious you punk hood
who the hell are you to tell me my business
i pulled them off
i dont care how many dago gangsters kill each other
i wouldnt lift a finger to keep your old man from getting knocked off
now get the hell out of here get off this street you punk and stay away from this hospital
michael stands quiet
ill stay until you put guards around my fathers room
phil lock this punk up
the kids clean captain
hes a war hero and hes never been mixed up in the rackets
furious goddam it i said lock him up
put the cuffs on him
deliberately right to mccluskeys face as hes being handcuffed how much is the turk paying you to set my father up captain
without any warning mccluskey leans back and hits michael squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength
michael groans and lifts his hand to his jaw
he looks at mccluskey we are his view and everything goes spinning and he falls to the ground just as we see hagen and clemenzas men arrive
high angle view of the corleone mall
the gateway now has a long black car blocking it
there are more button men stationed more formally and some of them visibly carrying rifles those of the houses close to the courtyard have men standing by open windows
it is clear that the war is escalating
a car pulls up and out get clemenza lampone michael and hagen
michaels jaw is wired and bandaged
he stops and looks up at the open window
we can see men holding rifles
christ sonny really means business
they continue walking
tessio joins them
the various bodyguards make no acknowledgment
how come all the new men
well need them now
after the hospital incident sonny got mad
we hit bruno tattaglia four oclock this morning
they enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces
sonny is in the dons office he is excited and exuberant
ive got a hundred button men on the streets twenty four hours a day
if sollozzo shows one hair on his ass hes dead
he sees michael and holds his bandaged face in his hand kiddingly
mikey you look beautiful
cut it out
the turk wants to talk
the nerve of that son of a bitch
after he craps out last night he wants a meet
was there a definite proposal
sure he wants us to send mike to meet him to hear his proposition
the promise is the deal will be so good we cant refuse
what about that tattaglias
what will they do about bruno
part of the deal bruno cancels out what they did to my father
we should hear what they have to say
no no consiglere
not this time
no more meetings no more discussions no more sollozzo tricks
give them one message i want sollozzo
if not its all out war
we go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street
the other families wont sit still for all out war
then they hand me sollozzo
come on sonny your father wouldnt want to hear this
this is not a personal thing this is business
and when they shot me father
yes even the shooting of your father was business not personal
no no no more advice on how to patch it up tom
you just help me win
hagen bows his head he is deeply concerned
i found out about this captain mccluskey who broke mikes jaw
hes definitely on sollozzos payroll and for big money
mccluskeys agreed to be the turks bodyguard
what you have to understand is that while sollozzo is guarded like this hes invulnerable
nobody has ever gunned down a new york police captain
it would be disastrous
all the five families would come after you sonny the corleone family would be outcasts even the old mans political protection would run for cover
take that into consideration
still fuming mccluskey cant stay with the turk forever
we cant wait
no matter what sollozzo say about a deal hes figuring out how to kill pop
you have to get sollozzo now
the kids right
what about mccluskey
lets say now that we have to kill mccluskey
well clear that up through our newspaper contacts later
go on mike
they want me to go to the conference with sollozzo
set up the meeting for two days from now
sonny get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held
insist it has to be a public place a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour
so ill feel safe
theyll check me when i meet them so i wont be able to carry a weapon but clemenza figure out a way to have one planted there for me
pause then ill kill them both
everyone in the room is astonished they all look at michael
sonny suddenly breaks out in laughter
he points a finger at michael trying to speak
you the high class college kid
you never wanted to get mixed up in the family business
now you wanta gun down a police captain and the turk just because you got slapped in the face
youre taking it personal its just business and hes taking it personal
now clemenza and tessio are also smiling only hagen keeps his face serious
angrily but cold sonny its all personal and i learned it from him the old man the godfather
he took my joining the marines personal
i take sollozzo trying to kill my father personal and you know ill kill them sonny
michael radiates danger
sonny stops laughing
close on a revolver
its as cold as they come impossible to trace
he turns it upside down dont worry about prints mike i put a special tape on the trigger and butt
he hands the gun to another pair of hands whatsamatter
trigger too tight
it fires very loud i left it noisy so itll scare any pain in the neck innocent bystander away
michael is alone with clemenza in a cellar workshop
just let your hand drop to your side and let the gun slip out
everybody will still think you got it
theyll be starin at your face see
then walk out of the place real fast but dont run
dont look anybody directly in the eye but dont look away from them neither
hey theyll be scared stiff o you believe me
nobodys gonna bother with you
dont worry about nothing youd be surprised how good these things go
put your hat on lets see how you look
helps with identification
they put the hat on clemenza adjusts it
mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light
then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell
how bad will it be
probably all the other families will line up against us
but its alright
these things have to happen once every ten years or so
gets rid of the bad blood
you gotta stop em at the beginning
like they shoulda stopped hitler at munich they shoulda never let him get away with that they were just asking for big trouble
michael steps into the foyer of the main house
a card table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the corleone buttonmen
he continues into the living room
its a mess
sonny asleep on the sofa
on the coffee table are the remains of a take out chinese food dinner and a half empty bottle of whisky
the radio is playing
why dont you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up
what are you inspecting the barracks
sonny sits up with his head in his hands you ready
did clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away
a million times
sollozzo and mccluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on times square under the big camels sign
we dont let mike go until we have the hostage sonny
the hostage is outside playing pinochle with three of my men
the phone rings in the dons office
that could be a tattaglia informer with the meeting place
hagen has hurried into the den to get the phone the others move in
hagens on the phone he writes something down
one of tattaglias people
our informer in mccluskeys precinct
tonight at he signed out for louis restaurant in the bronx
anyone know it
sure i do
its perfect for us
a small family place with big booths where people can talk in private
everybody minds their business
he moves to the desk and makes a crude drawing this is the entrance mike
when you finish just walk out and turn left then turn the corner
clemenza you gotta work fast to plant the gun
they got an old fashioned toilet with a space between the water container and the wall
we can tape the gun behind there
mike theyre gonna frisk you in the car
youll be clean so they wont worry bout nothing
in the restaurant wait and talk a while and then ask permission to go
then when you come out dont waste time dont sit down
you come out blasting
and dont take chances
in the head two shots apiece
and out as fast as your legs can move
i want somebody very good very safe to plant that gun
i dont want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand
the gun will be there
to michael warmly youre on kid
ill square it with mom your not seeing her before you left
and ill get a message to your girl friend when i think the time is right
we gotta move
how long do you think before i can come back
probably a year
starting to crack jesus i dont know
can you do it mike
michael moves out
the enormous camels sign puffing smoke below it stands michael dressed in a warm overcoat and wearing the hat clemenza had given him
a long black car pulls around the corner and slows before him
the driver leaning over open the front door
get in mike
he does the car drives off
inside the car sollozzo reaches his hand over the back seat and shakes mikes hand
im glad you came mike
i hope we can straighten everything out
all this is terrible its not the way i wanted things to happen at all
it should never have happened
i want to settle things tonight
i want my father left alone
he wont be i swear to you be my children he wont be
just keep an open mind when we talk
i hope youre not a hothead like your brother sonny
its impossible to talk business with him
hes a good kid
hes all right
turn around up on your knees facing me
he gives michael a thorough frisk
im sorry about the other night mike
im getting too old for my job too grouchy
cant stand the aggravation
you know how it is
michael looks at the driver and then ahead to see where theyre heading
the car takes the george washington bridge
michael is concerned
were going to new jersey
michael closes his eyes
the car speeds along the george washington bridge on its way to new jersey
then suddenly it hits the divider temporarily lifts into the air and bounces over into the lanes going back to new york
it then hits it very fast on the way back to the city
sollozzo checks to see the cars that had been following and then leans to the driver
nice work ill remember it
michael is relieved
the car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in the bronx the luna azura
there is no one on the street
michael looks to see if the driver is going to get out with them
he gets out and opens the door
sollozzo mccluskey and michael get out the driver remains leaning against the car
they enter the restaurant
a very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor
sollozzo michael and mccluskey sit around a rather small round table near the center of the room
there are empty booths along the side walls with a handful of customers and one or two waiters
it is very quiet
is the italian food good here
try the veal its the finest in new york
the solitary waiter brings a bottle of wine to the table
they watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three glasses
then when he leaves sollozzo turns to mccluskey i am going to talk italian to mike
sure you two go right ahead ill concentrate on my veal and my spaghetti
sollozzo now begins in rapid sicilian
michael listening carefully and nodding every so often
then michael answers in sicilian and sollozzo goes on
the waiter occasionally brings food and they hesitate while he is there then go on
then michael having difficulty expressing himself in italian accidentally lapses into english
using english for emphasis most important
i want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my fathers life
what guarantees can i give you
i am the hunted one
ive missed my chance
you think too highly of me my friend
i am not so clever
all i want if a truce
michael looks long and hard at sollozzo who is smiling holding his open hands up as if to say i have no tricks up my sleeve
then he looks away and makes a distressed look on his face
what is it
is it all right if i go to the bathroom
sollozzo is intuitively suspicious
he studies michael with his dark eyes
then he thrusts his hand onto michaels thigh feeling in and around searching for a weapon
i frisked him ive frisked thousands of young punks hes clean
he looks at a man sitting at a table opposite them indicating the bathroom with his eyes
the man nods indicating no one is there
dont take too long
michael gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom and disappears inside
michael steps into the small bathroom he is breathing very hard
he actually uses the urinal
then he washes his hands with the bar of pink soap and dries them thoroughly
then he moves to the booth up to the old fashioned toilet
slowly he reaches behind the water tank he panics when he cannot feel the gun
we see behind the tank his hand is just a few inches from the gun
he gropes searchingly
finally coming to rest on the gun
close on michael the feel of it reassures him
then he breaks it loose from the tape holding it he takes a deep breath and shoves it under his waistband
for some unexplainable reason he hesitates once again deliberately washes his hands and dries them
then he goes out
he hesitates by the bathroom door and looks at his table
mccluskey is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal
sollozzo turns around upon hearing the door and looks directly at michael
michael looks back
then he smiles and continues back to the table
he sits down
now i can talk
i feel much better
the man by the far wall had been stiff with attention now he too relaxes
sollozzo leans toward michael who sits down comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton his jacket
sollozzo begins to speak in sicilian once again but michaels heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear him
the waiter comes to ask about the order sollozzo turns to speak and without warning michael shoves the table away from him with his left hand and with his right
hand puts the gun right against sollozzos head just touching his temple
he pulls the trigger and we see part of sollozzos head blown away and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the entire area
the waiter looks in amazement suddenly his white jacket is sprayed and stained with blood
sollozzo seems in a perpetual fall to the floor through he seems to hang in space suspended
michael pivots and looks there is mccluskey frozen the fork with a piece of veal suspended in air before his gaping mouth
michael fires catching mccluskey in his thick bulging throat
he makes a horrible gagging choking sound
then coolly and deliberately michael fires again fires right through mccluskeys white topped skull
the air is filled with pink mist
michael swings toward the man standing by the bathroom wall
he does not make a move seemingly paralyzed
now he carefully shows his hands to be empty
the waiter steps backward through the mist of blood an expression of horror on his face
michael looks at his two victims sollozzo still in his chair side of his body propped up by the table
mccluskey finally falls from the chair to the table
michael is wildly at a peak
he starts to move out
his hand is frozen by his side still gripping the gun
he moves not letting the gun go
michaels face frozen in its expression
his hand still holding the gun
his face finally he closes his eyes
his hand relaxes the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud
he walks quickly out of the restaurant looks back
he sees a frozen tableau of the murder as though it had been recreated in wax
then he leaves
a man is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old upright piano while his cigarette burns on the edge
another stands nearby listening quietly
a little distance away ten men sit around a crude table quietly eating
they talk in low relaxed voices and there is an occasional laugh
rocco lampone stands by a window which has been covered with a heavy mesh wire grating gazing out
a large bowl of pasta is passed and the men eat heartily
the sentimental tune is continued over the following a man and a woman blood coming out of their noses lie still together in a bullet riddled automobile
a man is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop
ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty living room of an apartment
three or four men including clemenza are taking naps
an arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table
the men at the table continue their dinner passing and pouring the wine
trash is thrown in or garbage cans kept in the apartment
a man his clothes soaked in blood lies on the floor of an office building dead under an enormous portrait of harry s
another man his trousers soaked in blood lies spanning three steps of a front stoop
tessio sits in a simple straight backed chair doing a crossword puzzle
a thin boyish button man writes a letter
six or seven empty mattresses with tossed unmade blankets
coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays
a man by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of ruffino and wine is poured as the men eat
a corpse is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet alley
a man in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table in a pool of blood on the tablecloth
a neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an apartment
we catch a glimpse of one headline five family war
the men are sitting around cracking nuts
one has fallen asleep on his arms at the table
several men are taking naps on the mattresses
the piano player finishes the tune with finesse
picks up and takes a drag from his cigarette
the other man nods appreciatively
several cars are parked in front of a pleasant new york apartment building
we recognize a couple of sonnys bodyguards loafing by the cars pitching playing cards against the curb
inside the building two others wait quietly by the rows of brass mailboxes they have been there quite awhile
up one flight of stairs a single man sits on the step smoking a cigarette
one of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch which is attached to a key chain
we hear the sound of a door opening they look up
the man sitting on the stop stands and looks
sonny backs out of an apartment the arms of lucy mancini wrapped around him
she doesnt want to let go of him she draws him back into the apartment for a moment and then he comes out alone adjusting his clothes
he jauntily skips down the steps trailed by the bodyguard on the first floor and moves outside toward his car
the men quickly take up their positions
as he gets in his car pick up your sister
the car drives off accompanied and escorted by the bodyguards in their cars
he knocks on the door
who is it
its me sonny
we hear the bolt slide back and see the door open
sonny enters but connie has quickly moved into the hallway her back to him
tenderly connie what is it
he turns her around in his arms
her face is swollen and bruised and we can tell from her rough red eyes that she has been crying for a long time
as soon as he realizes whats happened his face goes red with rage
she sees it coming and clings to him preventing him from running out of the apartment
desperately it was my fault
i started a fight with him and i tried to hit him so he hit me
he didnt even try to hit me hard sonny i walked into it
sonny listens and calms himself
he touches her shoulder the thin silk robe
im goin to have the doctor come over and take a look at you
he starts to leave
oh sonny please dont do anything
he stops and then laughs good naturedly
whatm i goin to do
make your kid a orphan before hes born
she laughs with him
he kisses her reassuringly and leaves
carlo settles down on the front steps of the th st
book with sally rags and coach who have been drinking beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the corner
the ball game is blaring from the radio and the kids on the street are still playing stickball
carlo has barely settled down when the kids in the street suddenly scatter and a car comes screeching up the block and to a halt in front of the candy
the tires scream and before it seems as though it has even stopped a man comes hurtling out of the drivers seat moving so fast the everyone is paralyzed
it is a moment before we recognize that it is sonny
his face is contorted with anger in a split second he is on the stoop and has carlo by the throat
he pulls carlo away from the others trying to get him down into the street
but carlo reaches out for the iron railing and hangs on his hand in a lock cringing away trying to hide his head and face in the hollow of the
his shirt is ripped away in sonnys hand
sally rags and coach merely sit watching stunned
sonny is pounding the cowered carlo with all his strength in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing
his blows are powerful and begin to draw blood
the kids who have been playing stickball move up watching in fascination
carlos hands are clenched tight around the railing
sonny beats him mercilessly
now sonnys bodyguards car pulls up and they too become spectators
sonnys tight fists are going down like hammers into carlos face and body
carlos nose is bleeding profusely but still he does nothing other than hang onto the railing
sonny grabs hold of carlos massive body and tries to drag him off of the hold on the railing his teeth clenched in the effort
then he tries loosening carlos locked hands even biting them
carlo screams but he does not let go
its clear that carlo is much stronger than he is and will not be moved
sonny knees him in the mouth and beats him more but he is exhausted
totally out of breath he stammers haltingly to the bleeding carlo
hurt my sister
and ill kill
he wipes the sweat from his face and then turns suddenly
and hurries back to the car in a moment his car is gone leaving even his bodyguards in confusion
we notice one man with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially interested
carlo finally relaxes the clenched locked hands
he slumps onto the stoop
high angle on the corleone mall
it is a gray rainy day
young button men in raincoats stand in quiet groups of various points around the main house and compound
things have changed one house has been extensively enlarged a new and secure gate house has been built
security measures that had been make shift and temporarily have now been made a permanent part of the mall evolving it into a medieval fortress
we notice a huge crater in the courtyard the result of a recent bomb attempt
the house nearest the crater is damaged by fire
a taxi arrives kay adams steps out huddled in a bright yellow raincoat she lets the cab go and hurries to the shelter of the gate house
they are not expecting her and ask her to wait while they call the main house
kay looks at the imposing depressing mall while rain still runs down onto her face
she notices the bomb crater and the fire damage and the sullen faces of the button men
tom hagen exits the main house and hurries toward her
kay we werent expecting you
you should call
ive tried calling and writing
i want to reach michael
nobody knows where he is
we know hes all right but thats all
kay looks in the direction of the crater filling with rainwater
what was that
no one was hurt
listen tom i let my cab go can i come in to call another one
tom is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has to
they hurry through the rain and into the main house
in the living room kay shakes the water from her coat and takes her rainhat off
will you give this to him
if i accept that letter and you told a court of law i accepted it they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts
just wait kay hell contact you
we hear footsteps descending the staircase mama corleone enters the room the old woman squints at kay evaluating her
youre mikeys little girl
kay nods yes there are still tears in her eyes
you eat anything
kay shakes her head
to hagen disgrazia you dont even give the poor girl a cup of coffee
hagen shrugs helplessly on an impulse kay quickly moves toward mama the letter extended
will you give this letter to michael
you tell me what to do
even he dont tell me what to do
she takes the letter from kay who is grateful and relieved
why did they blame michael
you listen to me you go home to your family and you find a good young man and get married
forget about mikey hes no good for you anymore
she looks directly into kays eyes and kay understands what that means
a hospital in new york city
police and teams of private detectives are stationed guarding the area
an ambulance with a team of detectives and button men guards exit the hospital with rifles in hand followed by several hospital assistants wheeling a hospital stretcher presumably carrying the
tessio and clemenza emerge with other button men bringing up the rear
hagen walks with the stretcher and for a moment they disappear behind the ambulance
then suddenly siren blasting it speeds off accompanied by dark low slung cars
the corleone mall
equally impressive security stands ready at the corleone mall
extra button men as well as some police and private it all seems to be under the supervision of rocco lampone
all is silent
the women and children dressed in sunday clothes wait
one ambulance speeding along the grand central parkway preceded and followed by a dark car each one carrying a team of button men
sitting next to the driver of the ambulance is a guard with a rifle on his lap
inside the main corleone house hospital orderlies carry the don on his stretcher carefully under the watchful eyes of clemenza tessio lampone and various guards and button men
all the corleone family is here today mama fredo sandra theresa connie carlo the various corleone children
the don is made comfortable in his room which has all but been converted into a hospital room with complete and extensive equipment
the various children get a turn to kiss the old man as he is made comfortable
and then sonny indicates that all the children women and carlo should leave
they do the door is closed
the mood is quite happy downstairs as the women prepare the sunday dinner and set the table
carlo sits alone among them a frown on his face
whats the matter carlo
all the men of the family stand around the hospital bed with grim faces sonny and hagen closest to the old man
the don does not speak yet he asks questions with his looks and glances as clearly as if they were verbalized
hagen is the spokesman for the family
since mccluskeys killing the police have cracked down on most of our operations
on the other families too
theres been a lot of bad blood
the old man glances at sonny
pop they hit us and we hit them back
we put out a lot of material through our contacts in the newspapers
about mccluskeys being tied up with sollozzo in the drug rackets
things are starting to loosen up
the old man nods
freddies gonna go to las vegas
under the protection of don francesco of l
i want him to rest
im goin to learn the casino business
the don nods approvingly
then he searches around the room for a face he does not see
hagen knows who hes looking for
he takes a breath it was michael who killed sollozzo
the don closes his eyes and then reopens them in anger and rage
hes safe now
were already working on ways to bring him back
the don is very angry he motions with a weak hand that they leave him alone
hagen is very upset as he comes down the stairs sonny is expansive and optimistic
well let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks
i want to get things going good before he gets better
whats the matter with you
you start operating the five families will start their raids again
were at a stalemate sonny your war is costing us a lot of money
no more stalemate tom we got the soldiers well match them gun for gun if thats how they want it
they know me for what i am tom and theyre scared of me
thats true youre getting a hell of a reputation
well its war
we might not be in this shape if we had a real war time consiglere a sicilian
pop had genco who do i have
tom starts to leave hey tom hey
its sunday were gonna have dinner
dont be sore
the family wives children and all sit around the table over sunday dinner
sonny is at the head of the table
some of the corleone grandchildren play in the enclosed mall in the proximity of the button men stationed liberally by the gate
one child misses a ball it rolls by the gate house
a young button man scoops it up and throws it back smiling
connie and carlos apartment
shes in a slip on the phone
we hear the shower going in the bathroom
who is this
giggle im a friend of carlos
i just wanted to tell him i cant see him tonight i have to go out of town
connies face turns red
you lousy tramp bitch
click she slams the phone down just as carlo is coming out of the bathroom drying his golden body
what was that
your girl friend
she says she cant make it tonight
you lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number
ill kill you you bastard
she hauls off and punches him knowingly he laughs so then she flings herself at him kicking and scratching her heavy belly heaving under the thin slip
defending himself youre crazy
she was kidding around i dont know some nut
he pushes her aside and moves into the bedroom to continue dressing
youre staying home
youre not going out
you gonna make me something to eat at least
that calms her down she stands there a moment breathing heavily and then she nods and goes into the kitchen and starts her wifely duties
carlo is dressed puts on some cologne connie appears in the doorway
the food is on the table
im not hungry yet
eat it its on the table
ba fa goulle
she turns deliberately goes out into the kitchen
a moment later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking
carlo slowly walks out where we can see connie systematically smashing all the dishes against the sink sending the greasy veal and peppers all over the apartment floor
you filthy guinea spoiled brat
clean it up or ill kick your head in
like hell i will
she stands there solid ready to punch him again
slowly he slides his belt out of his trousers and doubles it in his hand
clean it up
he swings the belt against her heavy hips
she moves back into the kitchen and gets a kitchen knife and holds it ready
even the female corleones are murderers
he puts the strap down on a table and moves after her
she makes a sudden thrust at his groin which he avoids
he pulls the knife away cutting his hand in the process
she gets away momentarily but he pursues her around the table gets her and starts to slap her in the face
she breaks away from him and rushes into the bedroom
she runs into the bedroom he follows
she moves into a corner and then like a desperate animal tries to hide under the bed
he reaches under and pulls her out by the hair
he slaps her in the face until she begins to weep then he throws her on the bed contemptuously
he grabs part of her thigh pinching it very hard
youre fat as a pig
then he pushes her away and walks out of the room leaving her in tears
she is crying she pulls herself to the bedroom phone and in a whisper mama
mama its connie
mama i cant talk any louder
no i dont want to talk to sonny
we can tell that the phone has been passed to sonny
in the kitchen at the mall mama cannot understand the whispering and she has given the phone to sonny
sonny just send a car to bring me home
ill tell you then its nothing sonny dont you come
send tom please sonny its nothing i just want to come home
sonnys face is turning red
in a controlled voice you wait there
you just wait there
he hangs up the phone and just stands there for a moment
quietly that sonofabitch that sonofabitch
hagen enters the room he knows what is happening knows he cannot interfere
sonny leaves the house
hagen moves to the outside mall just as sonnys car is driving off
he moves to a group of go after him
sonnys car on the jones beach causeway speeds quickly by
after a pause another car with the corleone bodyguards is trailing
sonny is driving he is very angry
sonny in his car driving back
still breathing hard and still furious
then he thinks its funny he enjoyed it
he starts laughing louder and louder as he pulls up to a toll booth stops and extends his hand with a coin to the the serious faced undertaker is on
this is tom hagen
im calling for don corleone at his request
bonasera looks at his wife with deep anxiety in his eyes
bonaseras lips are suddenly dry
yes i understand
you owe the don a service
in one hour not before perhaps later he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help
be there to greet him
if you have any objections speak now and ill inform him
bonasera stutters then speaks in fright
anything the godfather wishes
he never doubted you
the don himself is coming to me tonight
click bonasera is sweating slowly he lowers the phone his wife sees his pale expression and follows him into the room
silently he begins the ritual of dressing
his wife knows something serious is happening and never takes her eyes from him
he lights a cigarette
for the last year they have been killing one another
so now what
your godfather comes to me
whispering slyly theyve killed someone so important that they wish to make his body disappear
they could make me an accomplice to their murder
they could send me to jail
he slips into his trousers
then he moves to his wife to tie his tie as she has done for years
and if the other families find out
they will make me their enemy
they could come here to our house
i curse the day i ever went to the godfather
with his ring of keys he opens the funeral parlor enters
bonasera walks through the darkened funeral parlor without turning on the lights then into the rear preparation room past the tables and equipment
he operates the chain that lifts a large overhead garage type door
and looks out into the alley
he sits on a bench and waits
the tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley we notice a dark car approach the rear of bonaseras funeral parlor
clemenza gets out and moves to the open rear door
bonasera greets him too petrified to speak
he notices two other men get out of the car and carry a stretcher with a corpse swaddled in a gray blanket with yellowed feet protruding
bonasera closes his eyes in fear but indicates which way the men should carry their sinister burden
they carry the corpse to one of the tables in the embalming room
then bonasera turns to see another man step out of the darkness somewhat uncertainly
it is don corleone
he walks up to bonasera very close without speaking
his cold eyes looking directly at the frightened undertaker
then after a long gaze well my friend are you ready to do me this service
the don moves to the corpse on the embalming table he makes a gesture and the other men leave them alone
what do you wish me to do
staring at the table i want you to use all your powers all your skill as you love me
i do not want his mother to see him as he is
he draws down the gray blanket
bonasera lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees the bullet smashed face of sonny corleone
sonny extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth
a car suddenly swerves in front of him trapping him in the booth and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets him coming through and smashing the windows of
the toll booths on both side of him and from the front window of the car blocking him
the windows of his car are shot out
bullet holes puncture the doors of his car
his hand with the coin in it falls inside the car
his arms shoulders are riddled by the fire and still it continues as though the assassins cannot take a chance that he will survive it
suddenly he lets out an enormous roar like a bull and actually opens the door and steps out of the car under fire
his face is hit and finally he falls to the ground
a full shot
as the assassins scramble for their cars and make off in the distance
sonnys bodyguards stop a safe distance away realizing they are too late
view on hagens ashen face in the living room
he is silent a moment and then quietly ok
go to clemenzas house and tell him to come here right away
hell tell you what to do
the men leave him alone
he is quiet standing in the middle of the living room a moment
he looks in the direction of the kitchen where he can see fragments of mama moving around
tom proceeds up stairs and quietly in the direction of the dons room
he opens the dons door
the don in his hospital bed
asleep under sedation
he cannot go in he cannot tell the old man
he closes the door
hagen alone in the office
he is drinking
he looks up at the sound of cars the caporegimes are arriving
then he hears footsteps
the door opens and in a robe with slippers don corleone slowly enters the room
he walks directly to his stuffed armchair sits down
his face is stern as he looks into hagens eyes
give me a drop of anisette
hagen rises and pours a glass for the old man
my wife was weeping before she fell asleep outside my window i saw my caporegimes to the house and it is midnight
so consigliere of mine i think you should tell your don what everyone knows
quietly i didnt tell mama anything
i was about to come up and wake you and tell you
but you needed a drink first
now youve had your drink
they shot sonny on the causeway
pause hes dead
don corleone blinks
one feels that just for a second he loses all physical strength he clasps his hands in front of him on the top of the desk and looks into hagens
i want no inquiries made
no acts of vengeance
pause consigliere arrange a meeting with the heads of the five families
this war stops now
he rises and unsteadily leaves the room turns
he will do me a service
hagen moves to the phone dials
this is tom hagen im calling for don corleone at his request
yes i understand im listening
you owe the don a service
he has no doubt that you will repay it
day in manhattan
an impressive bank building in the financial center of new york
many limousines are parked uniforms and plain clothed chauffeurs waiting quietly
the board room of a bank daylight shines in the windows
carlo tramonti an impressive handsome middle aged man sits quietly smoking a di napoli cigar our view moves to a man sitting to his left and a little to the
rear and settles on joseph zaluchi a moon faced amiable looking man as the view continues around the table we hear i want to thank you all for coming
i consider it a service done to me personally and i am in the debt of each and every one of you
especially those of you who have traveled from such distances as california st
louis kansas city and new orleans
the view passes to frank falcone and anthony molinari both younger than any of the others then on to domenick panza short and squat sitting in a wheelchair then around
the table to don vincenenzo forlenza who is whispering to his jewish assistant the view passes on to anthony stracci an older man sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar ottilio cuneo in his middle sixties with a jolly round face then don phillip tattaglia a delicate older man with dyed hair and a pencil mustache and finally emilio barzini in his early sixties a man to respect whom we had seen at connies wedding
ah well lets get down to business
we are all honorable men here we dont have to give assurances as if we were lawyers
he sits gazes out at them and sighs how did things ever go so far
well no matter
a lot of foolishness has come to pass
it was so unfortunate so unnecessary
the view examines the room once again as the don speaks
a large clicking board is changing numbers at various times and two tapes showing the fluctuations of the market during the days trading and projected above
don corleone pauses and tom hagen hands him a cold drink
tattaglia has lost a son i have lost a son
we are quits
let there be a peace
he gestures expressively submissively with his hands that is all i want
don corleone is too modest
he had the judges and politicians in his pocket and he refused to share them
his refusal is not the act of a friend
he takes the bread out of the mouths of our families
times have changed its not like the old days where everyone can go his own way
if don corleone had all the judges and politicians in new york then he must share them or let others use them
certainly he can present a bill for such services were not communists after all
but he has to let us draw water from the well
its that simple
my friends i didnt refuse out of malice
you all know me
when have i ever refused an accommodation
but why this time
because i think this drug business will destroy us in the years to come
its not like whiskey or gambling or even women which most people want and is forbidden them by the pezzonovante of the church and the government
even policemen who help us in gambling and other things would refuse to help us in drugs
i am willing to do whatever all of you think is necessary
i dont believe in drugs
for years i paid my people extra so they wouldnt do that kind of business
but it didnt matter
somebody comes to them and says i have powders if you put up three four thousand dollar investment we can make fifty thousand distributing
who can resist such a profit
theres no way to control it as a business
to keep it respectable
rapping the table i dont want it near schools
i dont want it sold to children
that is an infamita
thinking in my city i would try to keep the traffic in the dark people the colored
they are the best customers the least troublesome and they are animals anyway
they have no respect for their wives or their families or themselves
let them lose their souls with drugs
but something has to be done we cant have everybody running around doing just what they please like a bunch of anarchists
then are we agreed the traffic in drugs will be permitted but controlled and don corleone agrees to give it protection in the east
don corleone nods
thats the whole matter then we have the peace and let me pay my respects to don corleone whom we have all known over the years as a man of
noticing tattaglia is uneasy don philip
i agree to everything here im willing to forget my own misfortune
but i must hear strict assurance from corleone
when time goes by and his position becomes stronger will he attempt any individual vengeance
they all look at the don especially hagen who feels that don corleone has given a great deal and must have something else in mind
slowly the don rises
i forego my vengeance for my dead son for the common good
but i have selfish reasons
my youngest son had to flee accused of sollozzos murder and i must now make arrangements so that he can come home with safety cleared of all those false charges
that is my affair and i will make those arrangements
with strength but i am a superstitious man
and so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son if some police officer should accidentally shoot him or if he should hang himself in his cell or if
my son is struck by a bolt of lightning then i will blame some of the people here
that i could never forgive but
aside from that let me swear by the souls of my grandchildren that i will never be the one to break the peace we have made
the dons black limousine
he sits quietly in the padded rear seat tom hagen next to him
it is night
lights flash by them every so often
when i meet with tattaglias people should i insist that all his drug middle men be clean
mention it dont insist
barzini is a man who will know that without being told
you mean tattaglia
shaking his head barzini
a revelation he was the one behind sollozzo
tattaglia is a pimp
he could never have outfought santino
but i wasnt sure until this day
no it was barzini all along
the black limousine speeds away from us in the night
a close view of michael moving as he walks sullen and downcast the left side of his face healed but left grotesque and misshapen
gradually the view loosens he wears a warm navy pea jacket and walks with his hands in his pockets
the view loosens further revealing a sicilian shepherd on either side of him each carrying a shotgun slung over his shoulder calo a squat and husky young man with a
simple honest quality and fabrizzio slender and handsome likable and with a pleasing build
each of the shepherds carry knapsacks
the three young men continue over the sicilian landscape overlooking an impressive view of land and sea
the three move through a flock of wind blown sheep and make their way to a dusty rural road
we hear a rinky horn sound as a pre war italian automobile makes its way to them
an old man peeks from the window waving to michael
the car pulls in front of them and stops
michael nods respectfully
michael why must you do this
we have been lucky so far all these months youve been here weve kept your name a secret
it is from love for your father that ive asked you never to more than an hour from the villa
calo and fabrizzio are with me nothing will happen
you must understand that your fathers enemies have friends in palermo
where are you going
there is nothing there
i was told that my grandfather was murdered on its main street and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old
now there is nothing the men killed each other in family vendettas
the others escaped to america
i should see this place
don tommassino thinks a moment then concedes
that is your birthright
but michael use this car
i would like to walk to corleone
the old man sighs and then returns to his car
be careful michael dont let them know your name
the old car sputters off michael watches and then continues on his journey
the three pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit trees in bloom and bursting with life
they continue in the empty streets of a little town the post war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs and the empty streets
occasionally a military vehicle the only gasoline powered vehicles on the road will pass
and there are many police evident most of them carrying machine guns
the three pass under an enormous banner slung over the main road vota communista
they continue through dusty country roads where occasionally a donkey pulling a cart or a lone horseman will pass them
out in a field in the distance they come upon a procession of peasants and activists perhaps two hundred strong marching and singing and in the lead are five or
six men carrying billowing red banners
they are in an orange grove on the other side of the trees is a deep tall field of wild flowers
the shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks and take out loaves of bread some wine sausage and cheese
michael rests against a tree and uses his handkerchief
you tell us about america
how do you know i come from america
we were told you were a pezzonovanta
only the son of a pezzonovanta
is she as rich as they say
take me to america
you need a good lupara in america
pats his shotgun you take me ill be the best man you got
oh say can you seeee
by da star early light
the trio continues down a dirt road as an american military convoy speeds by fabrizzio waves and calls out to each of the u
drivers as they move by
take me with you
hey take me to america g
they continue their long hike high on a promentory until they hesitate and look down
they can see a grim sicilian village almost devoid of people
michael and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of the village
they walk behind him and spread to either side about fifteen feet away from him
they move down ancient steps past an old stone fountain
michael hesitates cups his hands and drinks some water
they go on
they move up a very narrow old street
michael looks at the doorways that they pass
moving view each door has a plaque with a ribbon or flower
calo sees michael looking
the names of the dead
michael hesitates in the center of the main street
the street is empty barren
occasionally an old woman will pass
michael turns his head
the other side of the street empty and deathly
a high view of michael standing in the center of the old street the shepherds a respectful distance away
a green ribboned field of a baronial estate
further ahead is a villa so roman it looks as though it had just been discovered in the ruins of pompeii
there is a group of young village girls accompanied by two stocky matrons dressed in black
they have been gathering the pink sulla purple wisteria and mixing them with orange and lemon blossoms
they are singing off in the distance as they work
michael calo and fabrizzio are silent as they watch this fantasy like scene
calling out to them hey beautiful girls
he settles down to watch
the girls are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that cling to their bodies
they are still in their teens but developed and womanly
they are moving along the fields picking blossoms not aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove
three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them playfully in the direction of the grove
the girl being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her left hand and with the right picks more grapes and throws them back at her pursuers laughing
they come closer and closer
just short of the grove she poses startled her large oval shaped eyes catching the view of the three men
she stands there on her toes about to run
michael sees her now face to face
incredibly beautiful with olive skin black hair and a rich mouth
murmuring jesus christ take my soul
quickly she turns and runs away
michael stands up never taking his eyes from her
we hold on him for a long while and eventually hear the shepherds laughing
then he turns to them
you got hit by the thunderbolt eh
calo pats him on the shoulder
what are you talking about
you cant hide it when youre hit by the thunderbolt
the little village built attendant to the baronial estate is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking
michael followed by the bodyguards moves into the central square and onto the balcony of a little cafe
the proprietor of the cafe vitelli is a short burly man he greets them cheerfully and sets a dish of chickpeas at their table
you know all the girls in this town eh
we saw some beauties coming down the road
one in particular got our friend hit with the thunderbolt
he indicates michael vitelli gives a big knowing laugh and looks at michael with new interest
you had better bring a few bottles home with you my friend youll need help sleeping tonight
he laughs this one could seduce the devil
and eyes as big and black as olives
laughing with them
pouring more wine i know about what you mean
this was a beauty
laughing beautiful all over eh
black and curly like a doll
and such a mouth
vitelli does not laugh quite so much
yes we have beautiful girls here
vitelli is no longer drinking with them
she wore a red dress and a red ribbon in her hair
she looks more greek than italian
do you know a beauty like that
as michael describes her vitelli laughed less and less until he wears a scowl
then he curtly leaves him and walks into the back room
god in heaven i think i understand
he goes into the back room after the innkeeper
then he returns
lets get out of here hes boiling up his blood to do us mischief
its his daughter
they start to leave but michael doesnt move
whispered the old bastard mentioned two sons he only has to whistle up
michael turns to fabrizzio with his cold authority
tell him to come to me
the two bodyguards shoulder their luparas and disappear in a moment they return with the red faced angry vitelli between them
quietly i understand ive offended you by talking about your daughter
i offer you my apologies im a stranger in this country i dont know the customs very well
let me say this i meant no disrespect to you or her
calo and fabrizzio are impressed
shrugs who are you and what do you want from my daughter
i am an american hiding in sicily from the police of my country
my name is michael
you can inform the police and make your fortune but then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband
in any case i want to meet your daughter
with your permission and under the supervision of your family
with all decorum
with all respect
i am an honorable man
calo and fabrizzio are stupefied vitelli pauses and then asks are you a friend of the friends
when the proper time comes ill tell you everything that a wifes father should know
its the real thunderbolt then
formally come sunday morning my name is vitelli and my house is up there on the hill above the village
your daughters name
music comes up as michael dressed in new clothes from palermo and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts gets into an alfa romeo
calo and fabrizzio each dressed in their sunday best are in the rear seat huddled together with their luparas on their shoulders
don tommassino waves them off as the little car drives off rocky and bouncing on the dirt road
the sunday churchbells ring
michael is presented to each of the vitelli relatives by the yard of their little hilltop house the brothers the mother who is given a gift several uncles and aunts
finally appolonia enters dressed beautifully in appropriate sunday clothing
now he presents the wrapped gift to appolonia
she looks at her mother who with a nod gives her permission to open it
she unwraps it
her eyes light at the sight of a heavy gold chain to be worn as a necklace
she looks at him
now the little alpha drives into the village near vitellis cafe
michael is as ever accompanied with his two bodyguards though they are all dressed differently
they go up to the cafe
and sit with vitelli who is talking and talking
michael looks at appolonia who sits respectfully quiet
she wears the gold necklace around her neck
michael and appolonia are walking through a hilltop path seemingly alone although a respectful distance apart
as the view pans with them we notice that her mother and a half dozen aunts are twenty paces behind them and ten paces further behind are calo and fabrizzio
their luparas on their shoulders
further up the hill appolonia stumbles on a loose stone and falls briefly onto michaels arm
she modestly regains her balance and they continue walking
behind them her mother giggles to herself
church bells in an ancient belfry ring out
music old and dissonant plays
there is a bridal procession in the street of the village the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five hundred years ago
donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant flowers children carrying candles and wearing white confirmation gowns walk in the procession followed by countless townspeople members of the clergy
even the police
we present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with all the ritual and pageantry as it has always been in sicily
appolonia is radiant as the bride michael is handsome despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief
calo and fabrizzio dance wildly through the night of the great wedding celebration
it is held in the village square under the watchful eyes of shepherds above on the tops of buildings carrying luparas
michael opens the shutters in his darkened room moonlight fills the room
he turns and there in her wedding slip is appolonia
a little frightened but lovely
he moves to her and for a moment just stands before her looking at her incredible face her lovely hair and body
slowly and tenderly he kisses her
her tiny hands come up to his face touch his cheek and embrace him
she lets her bridal slip fall to the floor
michael sits on the window ledge gazing into the room
appolonia is asleep she is naked and only partially covered by the bedsheets
he looks at her for a long time in the early morning light
we hear girlish laughter the little alpha is driving erratically knocking down an occasional wall and almost hitting th inner court wall
appolonia is laughing driving
michael pretends to be frightened as he teaches her to drive
outside the walls we notice shepherds with luparas walking guard duty
the car stops and a laughing michael gets out
its safer to teach you english
monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday
see i learned it
now teach me to drive
don tommassino enters the courtyard
he seems tired and concerned
ciao don tommassino
appolonia kisses him
things went badly in palermo
the younger men have no respect
things are changing i dont know what will happen
michael because of the wedding people now know your name
is that why there are more men on the walls
even so i dont think it is safe here anymore
ive made plans to move you to a villa near siracuse
you must go right away
what is it
bad news from america
your brother santino
he has been killed
for a moment the whole world of new york sollozzo the five family war all comes back to michael
michael leans out of the bedroom window
below fabrizzio is sitting in one of the garden chairs combing his thick hair
michael whistles and fabrizzio looks up to his window
get the car
ill be leaving in ten minutes
calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen
is your wife coming with you
no shes going home to her family
shell join me in a few weeks
michael dressed crosses from the hallway and into the kitchen
calo is just finishing a bite
he rises when he sees michael
should i get your bag
no ill get it
smiling she is sitting in the drivers seat of the car dying to step on the gas
shell be a real american woman before she gets to america
tell fabrizzio and wait for me in the car
he leaves the kitchen after a quick sip of coffee
he looks out from the opening in the doorway
there is the car with appolonia sitting in the drivers seat playing with the wheel like a child
calo moves to the car and puts a lunch basket in the rear seat
then michael seems disturbed
over on the other side of the courtyard he sees fabrizzio disappear through the gate
muttering to himself where the hell is he going
michael goes down the hallway and outside
michael steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer courtyard causing him to shade his eyes
appolonia sees him and waves motioning that he should stay where he is
calling out ill drive to you
he smiles affectionately
calo stands beside the car smiling with his lupara dangling by his side
there is no sight of fabrizzio
suddenly the smile fades from michaels face
he steps forward and holds out his hand
his shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous explosion as she switched on the ignition
part of the wall is caved in the kitchen door is blown off and there is nothing left of the alpha or of appolonia
michael is thrown against the wall and knocked unconscious
michael is unconscious in a darkened room
we hear whispering around him but cant make any of it out
a soft cloth is applied to his face gradually his eyes open
don tommassino is there close to him
he looks at them and from their grave expressions he knows his wife is dead
let your shepherds know that the one who gives me fabrizzio will own the finest pastures in sicily
a high view on the corleone mall in the springtime
hordes of little children including many of the corleone children and grandchilren rush about carrying little easter baskets searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden easter eggs
the don himself much older much smaller in size wearing baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat moves around his garden tending rows and rows of rich
suddenly he stops and looks
michael stands there still holding his suitcase
great emotion comes over the don who takes a few steps in michaels direction
michael leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son and embraces him
be my son
don corleone leads michael through the corridors of the building
this old building has seen its day
no way to do business
too small too old
they enter the dons glass panelled office
have you thought about a wife
i understand michael
but you must make a family you know
i want children i want a family
but i dont know when
accept whats happened michael
i could accept everything thats happened i could accept it but that i never had a choice
from the time i was born you had laid this all out for me
no i wanted other things for you
you wanted me to be your son
yes but sons who would be professors scientists musicians
and grandchildren who could be who knows a governor a president even nothings impossible here in america
then why have i become a man like you
you are like me we refuse to be fools to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men
i hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over
that was my misfortune
that was your misfortune
i was hunted on the streets of corleone when i was twelve years old because of who my father was
i had no choice
a man has to choose what he will be
i believe that
what else do you believe in
michael doesnt answer
believe in a family
can you believe in your country
those pezzonovante of the state who decide what we shall do with our lives
who declare wars they wish us to fight in to protect what they own
do you put your fate in the hands of men whose only talent is that they tricked a bloc of people to vote for them
michael in five years the corleone family can be completely legitimate
very difficult things have to happen to make that possible
i cant do them anymore but you can if you choose to
believe in a family believe in a code of honor older and higher believe in roots that go back thousands of years into your race
make a family michael and protect it
these are our affairs sono cosa nostra governments only protect men who have their own individual power
be one of those men
you have the choice
a moving view driving up the las vegas strip of
theres a new one
construction going on everywhere
more views showing new hotels and casinos being built the bill marquees read martin and lewis patti page etc
thats one of the familys new ones
not bad eh
the car pulls up at the flamingo hotel
inside the car michael fredo tom hagen and a new man neri quiet and sinister
why didnt moe green meet us at the airport
he had business at the hotel but hell drop in for dinner
from the expression on michaels face we know this is a discourtesy
a whole entourage precedes fredo and his v
party of michael hagen and neri
great fuss is made
they are being shown into the hotels special suite
you look wonderful kid really wonderful
that doctor did some job on your face
you look good too
they enter the suite
fredo is as excited as a kid snapping orders at the bellboys waiters and maids
hurrying into the bedroom kid take a look see
michael gives a look to hagen and continues into the bedroom
there is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform mirrors to each side
fredo points upward
a view into a large ceiling mirror
ever seen anything like that before
michael is alone in the bedroom
he is just finishing dressing he puts on his jacket
from the window with the lights blinking we can tell its late at night
michael passes into the other room
he stops looks
he is disturbed
a magnificent circular table has been set up in his suite a lavish table setting for eight
standing by the table are hagen johnny fontane looking wonderful a little heavier beautifully dressed fredo a dandy and two las vegas girls
neri stands quietly by the door
the party starting
come here a minute fredo
fredo goes to him a big smile all over his face
who are those girls
jokingly thats for you to find out
give them some money and send them home
get rid of them
they are seated around the lavish table in michaels suite
michael is speaking to johnny
johnny the corleone family is thinking of selling out all our interests in the olive oil business and settling here
moe greene will sell us his interest so it can be wholly owned by friends of the family
freddie seems anxious
mike you sure about moe selling
he never mentioned it to me and he loves the business
ill make him an offer he cant refuse
michael turns to johnny
johnny the don wants you to help us get started
we figure entertainment will be the big factor in drawing gamblers
we hope youll sign a contract to appear five times a year for maybe a week long engagement
we hope your friends in the movies will do the same
we count on you to convince them
sure ill do anything for my godfather
you know that mike
there is knock on the door
neri rises looks at michael who nods
neri opens the door and moe greene enters followed by two bodyguards
he is a handsome hood dressed in the hollywood style
his bodyguards are more west coast style
mike good to see you
got everything you want
the chef cooked for you special the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good
to his bodyguards draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house
is my credit good enough to buy you out
buy me out
the hotel the casino
the corleone family wants to buy you out
greene stops laughing the room becomes tense
neri eyes the bodyguards
furious the corleone family wants to buy me out
i buy you out
you dont buy me out
your casino loses money
maybe we can do better
you think i scam
the worst insult youre unlucky
you goddamn dagos
i do you a favor and take freddie in when youre having a bad time and then you try to push me out
you took freddie in because the corleone family bankrolled your casino
you and the corleone family are evened out
this is for business name your price
the corleone family dont have that kind of muscle anymore
the godfather is sick
youre getting chased out of new york by barzini and the other families and you think you can find easier pickings here
ive talked to barzini i can make a deal with him and keep my hotel
quietly deadly is that why you thought you could slap freddie around in public
his face turns red ah mike that was nothing
moe didnt mean anything
he flies off the handle sometimes but me and him are good friends
sometimes i gotta kick asses to make this place run right
freddie and i had a little argument and i had to straighten him out
you straightened my brother out
hell he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time
players couldnt get a drink
michael rises from his chair and says in a tone of dismissal i have to go back to new york tomorrow
think of your price
you son of a bitch you think you can brush me off like that
i made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders
frightened tom youre the consigliere you can talk to the don and advise him
the don has semi retired
im running the family business now
so anything you have to say say it to me
michael nods to neri who opens the door
moe exits angrily
freddie youre my older brother
i love you
but dont ever take sides with anybody against the family again
kay sits in the back of a limousine parked by the newark airport
rocco lampone is leaning against it
she has a little three year old boy michaels son who plays with a cardboard bird on a string
two other cars are stationed discreetly with men we have learned to tell are bodyguards
michael hagen and neri exit the airport with two negro porters carrying luggage
neri sees something and taps michael on the shoulder
michael turns and sees kay
lampone opens the car door kay steps out with the boy and michael embraces her and kisses his son
automatically the luggage is put in
neri replaces lampone as the driver and lampone joins the other men
hagen gets into one of the other cars
and the limo drives off preceded and followed by the other sedans
the little boy looks out the window as they drive
i have to see my father and his people when we get back to the mall
well go to the show tomorrow night we can change the tickets
dont you want dinner first
no you eat
dont wait up for me
wake me up when you come to bed
the little boy flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding limousine window
the limousine arrives at the mall
we are inside
your sister wants to ask you something
let her ask
neri opens the door
kay wants to talk just a little more
shes afraid to
michael nods to neri who gives them their privacy a moment longer
why are you so cold to her and carlo
they live with us on the mall now but you never get close to them
connie and carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy
neri opens the door michael starts to get out kay too
he smiles at her tired and a little sad
let me think about it o
she smiles michael goes with neri to the main house kay and the little boy move to the house that was sonnys
view on don corleone much older much smaller in size
he wears baggy pants and a warm plaid shirt
he sits in a chair gazing out through the window into the garden
barzinis people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it
pretty soon there wont be one place in brooklyn i can hang my hat
just be patient
im not asking you for help mike
just take off the handcuffs
we gotta fight sometime
let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength
no i dont want to give barzini an excuse to start fighting
mike youre wrong
the old man looks up
clemenza stand before him in the den
beside him is an anxious tessio
neri stands by the door hagen is seated michael sits behind the big desk
you said there would come a day when tessio and me could form our own families
only with your benediction of course
i ask permission
my son is head of the family now
if you have his permission you have my good will
in six months you can break off from the corleone family and go on your own
carlo im counting on you to make the move to nevada youll be my right hand man out there
tom hagen is no longer the consigliere
everyone is a bit surprised look to see hagens reaction
he remains inexpressive
hes going to be our lawyer in vegas
nobody goes to him with any other business as of now this minute
no reflection on tom thats the way i want it
besides if i ever need any advice whos a better consigliere than my father
then in a six month time were on our own is that it
let us fill up our regimes
i want things very calm for another six months
forgive me godfather let our years of friendship be my excuse
how can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up
the two go hand in hand
and with you gone from here the barzini and the tattaglias will be too strong for us
and i dont like barzini
i say the corleone family has to move from strength not weakness
we should build our regimes and take back our lost territories in staten island at least
do you have faith in my judgement
then do what michael says
all i can say is that things are being resolved that are more effective than a thousand buttonmen on the streets
there are uneasy looks all around
i just wish i was doing more to help out
ill come to you when i need you
he looks at clemenza tessio and hagen
they all nod reluctantly
all right then its resolved
neri knows the meeting is over he opens the dens door
clemenza and tessio pay their respects to the don and leave then carlo
neri watches carlo as he walks down the corridor casting a nervous look back at the sinister man
then neri closes the door
mike why are you cutting me out of the action
tom were going to be legitimate all the way and youre the legal man
what could be more important than that
im not talking about that
im talking about rocco lampone building a secret regime
why does neri report directly to you rather than through me or a caporegime
i told you that it wouldnt escape his eye
how did you find out
bookkeepers know everything
roccos men are all a little too good for the jobs theyre supposed to be doing
they get a little more money than the jobs worth
pause lampones a good man hes operating perfectly
not so perfectly if you noticed
mike why am i out
youre not a wartime consigliere
things may get tough with the move were trying
ok but then i agree with tessio
youre going about it all wrong youre making the move out of weakness
barzinis a wolf and if he tears you apart the other families wont come running to help the corleones
tom i never thought you were a bad consigliere i thought santino a bad don rest in peace
he had a good heart but he wasnt the right man to head the family when i had my misfortune
michael has all my confidence as you do
for reasons which you cant know you must have no part in what will happen
maybe i can help
coldly youre out tom
tom pauses thinks
and then he nods in acquiescence
michael looks at neri
im going to talk to my father
neri nods and then leaves
the don opens the doors breathes in the air and steps outside
i see you have your luca brasi
ill need him
there are men in this world who demand to be killed
they argue in gambling games they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender
these people wander through the streets calling out kill me kill me
luca brasi was like that
and since he wasnt scared of death and in fact looked for it
i made him my weapon
because i was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him
i think you have done the same with this man
they walk through the dons vegetable garden
tomatoes peppers carefully tended and covered with a silky netting
michael follows the don turns and looks at him
then stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over
barzini will move against you first
he will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust
that person will arrange a meeting guarantee your safety
he rises and looks at michael
and at that meeting you will be assassinated
the don walks on further
your wife and children
youre happy with them
michael wants to express something
hesitates then ive always respected you
a long silence
the don smiles at michael
kay and mama walking from the black car that has just left them off
how is your husband feeling
hes not the same since they shot him
he lets michael do all the work
he just plays the fool with his garden his peppers his tomatoes as if he was some peasant still
but men are like that
she stops toward the church
you come in too
kay shakes her head
the priest aint gonna bite you cause youre not catholic
whispered hes in the back drinkin his wine
kay laughs and follows mama up the steps of the church
inside the church kay watches as mama blesses herself from the holy water
tentatively kay dips her fingers into the water and blesses herself
then she follows mama down the aisle in awe at the high ceiling the art the windows and finally the altar
mama stops by the impressive tiers of candles
there is a large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles
mama fumbles in her purse for change kay gives her some
mama drops the coins in the box one by one then takes the taper and in a pattern known only to her and with great dignity she closes her eyes
says a prayer and then lights twenty candles
she finishes and bows her head
very few people in the streets
but black flower cars as far as the eye can see for blocks and blocks
an expression of respect of honor and fear that is enormous
certainly no more could be done for a president or a king
each car carries an elaborate floral decoration
we show these in detail and the flowered messages a benefactor to mankind he knew and pitied
our don our leader
the sacred heart
the flower cars funeral limousines and private cars fill all the areas attendant to the corleone residence
hundreds of people fill the mall reminiscent in size of the wedding of connie and carlo of course now the mood is somber and respectful
michael mama fredo and hagen stand by the flowered platform which holds the ornate coffin
we cannot see the remains of don corleone
bonasera is nearby ready to do service to the bereaved family
one by one the mourners come by weeping or merely with grave expressions pay their respects and continue on
the view alters and we see that the line is endless
johnny fontane tears openly falling takes his turn
children are taken by the hand and lifted for their last look at the great man
clemenza whispers into the ear of lampone
lampone immediately arranges for the members of the five new york families to pay their respects
first cuneo then strachi and then zaluchi
then philip tattaglia who merely passes by the coffin
then barzini in a black homburg standing a long time
michael watches the scene
barzini crosses himself and passes on immediately rejoined by his men
as barzini leaves it seems as though everyone is fawning on him perhaps asking for favors but at any rate it is clear from the doors opened for him the
cigars lit for him that he is the new capo di capi the place formerly held by don corleone
michael watches silently
barzini is searching for somebody with his eyes
connie rushes into michaels arms tears in her eyes
he embraces and comforts her
everywhere michael goes neri is a few feet away watching all who come close to him
later on the mall some people have left although there are still hundreds of mourners
a young girl approaches tessio
do you remember me
we danced together at connies wedding
tessio makes a gesture which is to say how youve grown and they move though the crowd looking for michael
he finds him
mike could i have a minute
mike nods and they move to a private place
neri is close by
barzini wants to arrange a meeting
says we can straighten any of our problems out
he talked to you
nods i can arrange security
michael looks at him
the hundreds of cars limousines and flower cars line the stone wall that surrounds this italian catholic cemetary in queens village
hundreds of people stand in a cluster others watch take pictures etc
michael stands with his family his mother
and tom hagen
softly christ tom i needed more time with him
i really needed him
did he give you his politicians
i needed another four months and i would have had them all
he looks at tom i guess youve figured it all out
how will they come at you
i know now
a passion wells up inside of michael ill make them call me don
have you agreed on a meeting
nods a week from tonight
in brooklyn on tessios ground where ill be safe
hagen looks at him understands
but after the baptism
ive decided to stand as godfather to connies baby
they look up
the coffin is lowered into an excavation behind which stands an enormous stone monument it is of a weeping angel with the bold inscription corleone
albert neri moves around in his small corona apartment he pulls a small trunk from under his bed
he opens it and we see in it nearly folded a new york city policemans uniform
he takes it out piece by piece almost reverently
then the badge and the identification card with his picture on it
slowly in the solitude of his room he begins to dress
michael and kay are getting dressed for the christening in their room
michael looks very well very calm kay is beginning to take on a matronly look
in a long island motel
rocco lampone carefully disassembles a revolver oils it checks it and puts it back together
peter clemenza about to get in his lincoln
he hesitates takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender and then gets in drives off
various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the church
they laugh and talk
a monsignor is officiating
not all of the participants have arrived yet
connie is there with a beaming carlo
she holds the infant showing him off to interested people
neri walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the un building
he is dressed as and has the bearing of a policeman
he carries a huge flashlight
lampone steps out onto the little balcony of a sea resort motel we can see the bright neon lit sign advertising the church
connie holds the baby the monsignor is speaking kay and michael stand side by side around the urn
to michael do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless
do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world
yes i promise
neri continues up the th st
and fifth avenue area
he continues until he is in front of rockefeller center
on his side of the street he spots a limousine waiting directly across from the main entrance of the building
slowly he approaches the limo and taps on its fender with his nightstick
the driver looks up in surprise
neri points to the no parking sign
the driver turns his head away
ok wise guy you wanna summons or you wanna move
obviously a hood you better check with your precinct
the driver takes a ten dollar bill folds it deliberately and hands it out the window trying to put it under neris jacket
neri backs up letting the bill fall onto the street
then he crooks a finger at the driver
let me see you license and registration
lampone on the motel balcony spots a cadillac pulling up
a young pretty girl gets out
quickly he returns into the room
clemenza is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel
he rounds the corner puffs a little and then continues upward
close on the priests fingers as he gently applies oil to the infants ears and nostrils
so you may perceive the fragrance of gods sweetness
the driver of the limousine in front of rockefeller center is arguing with neri
now the driver looks up
two men in topcoats exit the building through the revolving glass doors
neri opens up fire trapping barzini in the shattering glass doors
the doors still rotate moving the dead body of barzini within them
in the church the view on michael
the priest hands him the infant
do you renounce satan
i do renounce him
and all his works
i do renounce them
lampone backed up by two other men in his regime runs down the iron rail steps and kicks in the door on room f
philip tattaglia old and wizened and naked leaps up a semi nude young girl leans up
they are riddled with gunfire
clemenza huffing and puffing climbs the back stairs with his package
the priest pours water over the forehead of the infant michael holds
do you wish to be baptized
i do wish to be baptized
clemenza out of breath climbs the final few steps
he walks through some glass doors and moves to an ornate elevator waiting shaft
the lights indicate the elevator has arrived
the doors open and we see a surprised cuneo standing with the dapper moe greene
clemenza fires into the small elevator with a shotgun
the priest hands a lighted candle to michael
i christen you michael francis rizzi
flash bulbs go off
everyone is smiles and crowds around michael kay connie
the christening party outside the church
four or five limousines have been waiting now pull up to receive mama connie and the baby and the others
everyone is very happy only michael seems aloof and grave
as the fuss is going on a car pulls up
lampone gets out and works his way to michael
he whispers in his ear
this is the news michael has been waiting for
connie holds the baby up to michael
kiss your godfather
the infant turns its head and michael uses that as an excuse to back away
weve had a change in the plans
mama connie kay and the kids will have to take the trip out to vegas without us
oh mike its our first vacation together
anxious to please jesus connie
go back to your house and wait for me
he kisses kay
to kay ill just be a couple of days
people are guided to the correct limousines they start to drive off
tessio sits in the kitchen of the main house on the mall
youd better make your call to barzini michaels ready
tessio nods moves to the telephone and dials a number
were on our way to brooklyn
he hangs up and smiles
i hope mike can get us a good deal tonight
gravely im sure he will
the two men walk out onto the mall toward a car
on their way they are stopped by two bodyguards
the boss says hell come in a separate car
he says for you two to go on ahead
frowning hell he cant do that
it screws up all my arrangements
three more bodyguards appear around him
gently i cant go with you either tessio
he flashes at the men surrounding him for a moment he panics and then he accepts it
after the pause tell mike it was business
i always liked him
he understands that
tessio looks at the men and then pauses
softly tom can you get me off the hook
for old times sake
hagen turns and walks away from the group
then about twenty paces away he stops and looks back
tessio is led into a waiting car
hagen looks away and walks off
carlo rizzi is alone in his house smoking waiting rather nervously
he moves to the window and looks out
michael still dressed in a dark suit followed by neri lampone and clemenza then hagen
they move toward us
excitedly carlo moves to the front door opens it
he wears a broad smile
you have to answer for santino
the smile on carlos face slowly fades then in a foolish attempt for safety he slams the door in their faces and backs into the living room
the door opens and the grim party enters
you fingered sonny for the barzini people
that little farce you played out with my sister
did barzini kid you that would fool a corleone
dignity i swear im innocent
i swear on the head of my children im innocent
mike dont do this to me please mike dont do this to me
quietly barzini is dead
so is philip tattaglia so are strachi cuneo and moe greene
i want to square all the family accounts tonight
so dont tell me youre innocent admit what you did
carlo is silent he wants to talk but is terrified
almost kindly dont be frightened
do you think id make my sister a widow
do you think id make your children fatherless
after all im godfather to your son
no your punishment is that youre out of the family business
im putting you on a plane to vegas and i want you to stay there
ill send connie an allowance thats all
but dont keep saying youre innocent it insults my intelligence and makes me angry
who approached you tattaglia or barzini
sees his way out barzini
softly good good
leave now theres a car waiting to take you to the airport
carlo moves to the door opens it
there is a car waiting with a group of men around it
he looks back at michael who reassures him
ill call your wife and tell her what flight youre on
carlo moves out to the mall the buttonmen are putting his things in the trunk
one opens the front door for him
someone is sitting in the rear seat though we cannot see who
carlo gets into the car out of nervousness he looks back to see the other man
it is clemenza who nods cordially
the motor starts and as the car pulls away clemenza suddenly throws the garrote around carlos neck
he chokes and leaps up like a fish on a line kicking his feet
the garrote is pulled tighter carlos face turns color
his thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield
then the body goes slack
clemenza makes a foul face and opens the window as the car drives off
michael and his party
then he turns and walks off and they follow
michael sits alone in the back of his car neri is driving
they do not speak for a long time it is night car lights flash by
neri turns back
you know i would never question anything you say
smiles speak your mind
ill do this for you you know i should
this i have to do
michaels car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood near an italian pizzeria
neri opens the door
sit in the car
he walks alone into the restaurant
a man is tossing pizza dough in the air
wheres the boss
in the back
hey frank someone wants you
a man comes out of the shadows with a strong italian accent
what is it
he stops frozen in fear
it is fabrizzio
view on michael
gunfire from under his coat
fabrizzio is cut down
michael throws the gun down turns and exits
several moving vans are parked in the mall one feels that these are the final days the families are moving out signs indicating that the property is for sale are
a black limousine pulls up and before it has even stopped the rear door flies open and connie attempts to run out restrained by mama
she manages to break free and runs across the mall into michaels house
inside the corleone house
big boxes have been packed furniture prepared for shipping
she hurries into the living room where she comes upon michael and kay
but connie avoids her and moves directly to michael
neri is watchful
you lousy bastard you killed my husband
you waited until our father died and nobody could stop you and you killed him you killed him
you blamed him about sonny you always did everybody did
but you never thought about me never gave a damn about me
crying what am i going to do now what am i going to do
two of michaels bodyguards move closer ready for orders from him
but he stands there waiting for his sister to finish
connie how could you say such things
why do you think he kept carlo on the mall
all the time he knew he was going to kill my husband
but he didnt dare while my father was alive
and then he stood godfather to our child
that coldhearted bastard
to kay and do you know how many men he had killed with carlo
just read the papers
thats your husband
she tries to spit into michaels face but in her hysteria she has no saliva
get her home and get a doctor
the two bodyguards immediately take her arms and move her gently but firmly
kay is shocked never taking her look of amazement from michael
he feels her look
but kay wont let him avoid her eyes
michael its not true
please tell me
dont ask me
all right this one time ill let you ask about my affairs one last time
is it true
she looks directly into his eyes he returns the look so directly that we know he will tell the truth
after a very long pause no
kay is relieved she throws her arms around him and hugs him
then she kisses him
through her tears we both need a drink
she moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the drinks
from her vantage point as she smilingly makes the drinks she sees clemenza neri and rocco lampone enter the house with their bodyguards
she watches with curiosity as michael stands to receive them
he stands arrogantly at ease weight resting on one foot slightly behind the other
one hand on his hip like a roman emperor
the caporegimes stand before him
clemenza takes michaels hand kissing it
the smile fades from kays face as she looks at what her husband has become
kay wears a shawl over her hand
she drops many coins in the coin box and lifts a burning taper and one by one in a pattern known only to herself lights thirty candles
