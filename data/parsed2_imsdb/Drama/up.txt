a s newsreel
movietown news presents
spotlight on adventure
the mysterious south american jungle
a massive waterfall cascades down a gigantic flat topped mountain
what you are now witnessing is footage never before seen by civilized humanity a lost world in south america
lurking in the shadow of majestic paradise falls it sports plants and animals undiscovered by science
who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit
a painted portrait of a dashing young adventurer
why our subject today charles muntz
a massive dirigible descends on an airfield
the beloved explorer lands his dirigible the spirit of adventure in new hampshire this week completing a year long expedition to the lost world
of everyone watching in the modest small town theater no one is more enthralled than year old carl fredricksen
this lighter than air craft was designed by muntz himself and is longer than prohibition paddy wagons placed end to end
young carl stares mouth agape wearing leather flight helmet and goggles just like his idol on the silver screen
and here comes the adventurer now
newsreel footage the dashing muntz descends down the gangplank to the delight of the crowd
his dogs trail him
never apart from his faithful dogs muntz conceived the craft for canine comfort
its a veritable floating palace in the sky
an opulent dining room
complete with doggie bath and mechanical canine walker
one dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time while a second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill
and jiminy cricket do the locals consider muntz the bees knees
cameras flash as muntz stands heroic striking his signature thumbs up stance
adventure is out there
in the theater young carl returns the thumbs up
but what has muntz brought back this time
muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium on stage beside a curtained object
gentlemen i give you the monster of paradise falls
he pulls away the drape to reveal a giant bird skeleton
young carl leans forward eyes bulging
and golly what a swell monster this is
but whats this
skeptical scientists analyze the bones
scientists cry foul
the national explorers society accuses muntz of fabricating the skeleton
muntzs portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other famous explorers
the organization strips muntz of his membership
muntzs explorers society badge is ceremoniously ripped from his jacket
muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield
he grimly addresses the crowd
humiliated muntz vows a return to paradise falls and promises to capture the beast
i promise to capture the beast
in the theater young carl smiles
and i will not come back until i do
the crowd cheers
muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible lifts off
and so the explorer is off to clear his name
bon voyage charles muntz and good luck capturing the monster of paradise falls
carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle
young carl flies his blue balloon the spirit of adventure hand written on it as he runs along the sidewalk
he still wears helmet and goggles
heres charles muntz piloting his famous dirigible
he hurdles pikes peak
carl jumps over a small rock
he hurdles the grand canyon
carl jumps over a crack in the sidewalk
he hurdles mount everest
carl jumps over a tree stump
and smacks into it instead
goes around mount everest
is there nothing he cannot do
yes as muntz himself says adventure is adventure is out there
who said that
the voice comes from a dilapidated house windows boarded up and lawn overgrown with weeds
the weather vane atop the house turns pulled by ropes
hard to starboard
must get the spirit of adventure over mount rushmore
carl walks toward the voice
hold together old girl
howre my dogs doing
carl squeezes through the broken door into the foyer
he follows the voice toward the living room
all engines ahead full
lets take her up to feet
rudders eighteen degrees towards the south
carl rounds the corner to see
ellie an eight year old girl her mussy red hair barely visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles
bare footed her overalls are patched and dirty
the old house has been transformed into a make believe dirigible cockpit
ellie steers the wheel made from a rusty old bicycle
its a beautiful day winds out of the east at ten knots
yells a command enter the weather in the logbook
the navigator her hamster skitters in its cage
ellie uses two tied together coke bottles as binoculars
theres something down there
i will bring it back for science
awwww its a puppy
carl is distracted by the muntz newspaper clippings taped to the wall
ellie pops up in front of carl
what are you doing
he lets go of his balloon
it floats through a broken part of the ceiling and disappears
ellie circles carl accusingly
dont you know this is an exclusive club
only explorers get in here
not just any kid off the street with a helmet and a pair of goggles
do you think you got what it takes
well do you
alright youre in
she offers her hand
carl looks down embarrassed
cant you talk
carl is frozen
hey i dont bite
she takes off her helmet
her hair frizzes out in all directions
she removes a homemade grape soda cap pin from her shirt and pins it on carl
you and me were in a club now
i saw where your balloon went
come on lets go get it
carl watches her stride out of the room
she pops back in
my names ellie
she grabs his hand
carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room
there it is
carl and ellie look across the attic at the balloon
between them the floor has collapsed save one rickety beam
well go ahead
she pushes him out onto the beam
carl steels his courage
he puts on his goggles starts forward
and falls through the floor
one lone light on upstairs
carl in bed reading a book by flashlight his arm in a cast
into the room floats carls lost blue balloon
carl jumps and calls out in fright
re arm ow
a head pops up from outside the open window
carl screams hitting himself in the face with the cast
ellie climbs in the window
thought you might need a little cheerin up
i got somethin to show ya
the two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight
ellie whispers as if to protect a national secret
i am about to let you see something i have never shown to another human being
in my life
carls eyes widen in alarm
youll have to swear you will not tell anyone
cross your heart
my adventure book
its a reused photo album with the words my adventure book written across it
she opens it to a photo of charles muntz
you know him
carl smiles excitedly
charles muntz explorer
when i get big im going where hes going south america
she turns the page to a map
its like america
wanna know where im gonna live
she turns to an engraving of a large waterfall
a small hand drawn picture of ellies clubhouse is glued to the top
reading caption paradise falls a land lost in time
i ripped this right out of a library book
carl gasps in horror
im gonna move my clubhouse there and park it right next to the falls
who knows what lives up there
and once i get there
she flips through her book revealing a page marked stuff im going to do
past that the pages are blank
well im saving these pages for all the adventures im gonna have
i just dont know how im gonna get to paradise falls
ellie closes the book disappointed
carl has a thought
he looks at his toy dirigible
you can take us there in a blimp
swear youll take us
cross your heart
cross your heart
no backing out
carl shakes his head no
well see you tomorrow kid
ellie hops up and jumps out the window
adventure is out there
she pops back in
you know you dont talk very much
i like you
carl looks out the window after her in amazement
he rests his head on his balloon
the balloon pops
a photo is taken of the wedding couple carl and ellie now
she jumps at him and gives him a big kiss
ellies side of the church erupts like wild frontiersmen
a gun shot is fired in the air
carls side rigid puritans in black clap politely
carl carries her past a sold sign
its the same house where they met as kids
still in their wedding clothes she saws as he hammers
they push two chairs into place side by side in the living room
ellie finishes painting carl ellie on their mailbox
carl leans in to admire her work but leaves a messy paint handprint on the mailbox
oh well ellie adds her handprint as well
their house now matches ellies colorful club house drawing from her childhood adventure book
they run up a hillside together
they lie side by side on a picnic blanket
she describes the clouds
he watches as a cloud transforms into a turtle
carl closes his eyes and smiles
hes lucky to be with her
ellie emerges from the south america house dressed in her zookeepers uniform
carl shows off his new balloon cart and uniform
behind him the balloons lift his cart off the ground
carl jumps to catch it
carl and ellie sit side by side in their chairs reading
without looking up from their books they hold hands
again at their picnic spot they watch clouds
ellie sees an elephant with wings
carl gives it a try and points out a baby
ellie lights up excited
she sees all the clouds as babies
carl is stunned
ellie finishes painting a wall mural of a stork carrying a bundle in its beak
carl hangs a mobile above the crib
carl touches ellies shoulder as the doctor explains
ellie drops her head in her hands
carl looks out the window
ellie sits alone under a tree the wind in her hair
carl joins ellie
he hands her the adventure book
ellie paints a mural of their house atop paradise falls over the mantle
carl organizes a compass map binoculars and native bird figurine beneath the painting
its their shrine to adventure
carl sets a jar on a table paradise falls written on it
ellie drops in a few coins
she looks at carl and crosses her heart
carl crosses his
the jar slowly fills as carl and ellie toss in spare change
their car blows a tire
the two stand by the jar reluctant
carl breaks the jar
carl in the hospital with a broken leg
a storm rages
a tree falls crushing the roof
carl struggles to tie his tie
they walk out the front door arm in arm
ellie struggles to tie carls tie as they rush out the door
a series of shots as ellie straightens carls ties
stylish s ties
wide s ties
paisley s ties
older carl and ellie smile at themselves in the hall mirror
carl in his s
they still work happily side by side at the zoo
carls cart lifts off the ground
he casually leans an elbow on it
carl and ellie dance in the evening candlelight
the paradise falls jar sits off to the side now dusty and forgotten
carl cleans the inside of the window
ellie cleans the outside
carl vacuums the adventure shrine on the mantle
carl smiles at a photo of ellie as a child wearing her flight helmet and goggles
he looks up at the mural of their house at paradise falls
his smile fades
behind him ellie sweeps the floor
their dream has gone unfulfilled
carl has an idea
carl buys two tickets to south america
carl hurries excitedly up picnic hill
he hides the airline tickets in his basket
behind him ellie falters and falls
she tries to get up but falls again
something is wrong
he runs to her
ellie lies in a hospital bed
she looks through her a blue balloon floats in to the room
carl stands at the door
he smiles and walks to her bedside
ellie pushes her adventure book toward him
she weakly pats his cheek and adjusts his tie
he kisses her on the forehead
carl sits alone next to a huge bouquet of balloons
carl walks into the house holding a single blue balloon
an alarm clock buzzes
an aged hand shuts it off and picks up the nearby glasses
carl sits alone in his double bed
he rubs his face
he gets out of bed stretching grunting and cracking bones
he grabs his cane with four tennis balls stuck to the bottom spokes
now dressed carl rides his elderly assistance chair down the staircase
this takes a long long time
three quarters of the way down the chair stops
he bangs the armrest and the chair restarts
carl eats breakfast by himself
carl cleans the window with a cloth
his lonely reflection stares back at him
carl dusts the mantle and shrine to adventure
carl looks in the hall mirror
he puts on his hat and considers his reflection
he straightens his grape soda pin
many locks are heard unlocking from inside
the door opens but bangs against the safety chain
carl grumbles in frustration
carl opens the door walks out onto his porch pulls the door shut and looks as if hes about to go somewhere
he sits in his porch chair
carls house is the lone surviving square on the block not under construction
machinery and workers circle busily
high rise buildings are being erected all around
carl looks at the activity around him
quite a sight huh ellie
noticing mailbox uhp mails here
carl walks to the mailbox
he touches ellies faded handprint and smiles
he looks through the mail
he sees a shady oaks retirement village pamphlet full of images of happy old people
shady oaks retirement
carl notices dust on his mailbox
he pulls up a leaf blower
he revs it and blasts off the dust
tom the construction foreman notices
need any help there
tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house
he points across the lot to a business man in a suit talking on a cell phone the real estate developer
well just to let you know my boss would be happy to take this old place off your hands and for double his last offer
whaddya say to that
the leaf blower blasts off his hat
uh i take that as a no then
i believe i made my position to your boss quite clear
you poured prune juice in his gas tank
oh yeah that was good
here let me talk to him
tom hands carl his megaphone
in megaphone you in the suit

tom grabs the megaphone
to boss re carl i am not with him
to carl this is serious
hes out to get your house
carl walks to his front door
tell your boss he can have our house
when im dead
carl slams the door
ill take that as a maybe
carl sits in his chair watching tv
a knock at the door
the door opens
a wilderness explorer stands reading from a wilderness explorer manual
he is in uniform complete with sash neckerchief hat and an enormous backpack stuffed with every piece of equipment there is
this is russell age
russell nose buried in his manual reads to carl
my name is russell
and i am a wilderness explorer in tribe sweatlodge
are you in need of any assistance today sir
as he finishes the script russell smiles up at carl
i could help you cross the street
i could help you cross your yard
i could help you cross your
well i gotta help you cross something
im doing fine
carl closes the door in russells face
carl listens through the door
is the kid gone
he opens it
my name is russell
and i am a wilderness explorer in tribe sweatlodge
but goes back to reading
are you in need of any assistance today sir
thank you but i dont need any help
carl swings the door shut but a small camping boot stops it
carl opens the door
russell stands at attention
my but skip to the end
russell points to his sash
it is covered with badges except for one glaringly empty space
these are my wilderness explorer badges
you may notice one is missing
its my assisting the elderly badge
if i get it i will become a senior wilderness explorer
russell makes the explorer sign his thumbs form a w his fingers the wings of a bird then the claws of a bear
the wilderness must be explored
this sets carls hearing aid off
carl grumbles in pain
its gonna be great
theres a big ceremony and all the dads come and they pin on our badges
so you want to assist an old person
then i will be a senior wilderness explorer
carl leans in close to russell
you ever heard of a snipe
every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas
im elderly and infirm
i cant catch it
if only someone could help me
ill do it
oh i dont know its awfully crafty
youd have to clap your hands three times to lure it in
ill find it mr
i think its burrow is two blocks down
if you go past two blocks down
russell runs down the block clapping and calling
here snipey snipey
calls after russell bring it back here when you find it
carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door
he stops short
a large truck is backing up getting dangerously close to okay keep her coming
the truck hits ellies mailbox crushing the front
carl is shocked
he runs to the box
what do you think youre doing
i am so sorry sir
the worker bangs on the mailbox trying to fix it
dont touch that
no no let me take care of that for you
carl grabs the mailbox trying to wrestle it from the worker
get away from our mailbox
hey sir i
i dont want you to touch it
carl hits the worker with his cane
he falls to the sidewalk
the worker rubs his head
carl backs up toward his door cradling his mailbox
what has he done
workers gather as does the real estate developer
carl backs into his house
carl shuts his door
he closes the curtains
he peeks out the window
the injured worker is helped to his feet
a police car pulls up
the real estate developer looks toward carls house
his hand rests on carls fence
carl sits alone on a bench holding a court summons
a guard opens the door
the real estate developer watches him enter
a police officer drops carl at his front gate
you dont seem like a public menace to me
she hands him a pamphlet for shady oaks retirement village
the guys from shady oaks will be by to pick you up in the morning okay
the officer drives off leaving carl alone
carl faces the house
he touches ellies dented mailbox
what do i do now ellie
all is quiet but the slow ticking of the clock
the empty hall
the front hall mirror
carl pulls out a suitcase
a book tips over
ellies adventure book
carl sits in his chair slowly paging through the book
he turns to the page marked stuff im going to do
he closes the book and sighs
carl looks at the adventure shrine and the painting of their house by paradise falls
he holds the shady oaks pamphlet
carls brows furrow
he looks up at the shrine and crosses his heart
lights are on inside the house
a shady oaks retirement village van pulls up
nurses george and a
walk to carls door and knock
carl answers holding a suitcase
good morning mr
you ready to go
ready as ill ever be
would you do me a favor and take this
carl hands over his suitcase
ill meet you at the van in just a minute
want to say one last goodbye to the old place
take all the time you need sir
carl closes the door
the nurses head back to the van
hes probably going to the bathroom for the eightieth time
empty helium tanks are strewn on the front lawn
youd think hed take better care of his house
a shadow falls over the nurses
they turn to look
a giant tarp rises behind carls house
it unfolds to reveal the balloons rise up like some massive multi colored cumulus cloud forming a thunderhead above the house
strings tug at the chimney
the house strains
pipes bend then break
electrical wires spark and snap
the house rips away from its foundation
the nurses duck and yell as the house soars over them
carl looks out the window and laughs
so long boys
ill send you a postcard from paradise falls
balloons spill colored light into a little girls room as the house floats past
the shadow of the house drifts through an intersection
a family watches the house float down the street
carl waves at a high rise window washer who tentatively waves back
the house crests the top of a building drifting over and away from the city
carl looks out his window
carl sets a compass next to the map of south america
sails made from stitched together curtains emerge from the windows and billow in the wind
carl steers using ropes attached to the weather vane
the compass needle rotates to point south
the house turns
carl looks out the window satisfied
he checks the balloons
carl kisses a photo of ellie
were on our way ellie
carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings tied to the grate
he chuckles and settles into his chair
he closes his eyes and smiles
shadows move gently across the fireplace mantle
the house drifts through the clouds
carl relaxes in his chair
he stares at the front door
he bolts up and approaches the door
he looks out the peep hole
nothing but the porch and clouds
he throws it open
he looks left
he looks right
its me russell
what are you doing out here kid
russell is plastered up against the wall terrified and holding on for dear life
i found the snipe and i followed it under your porch but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse
the flag on russells backpack blows off and falls through the clouds
please let me in
carl slams the door leaving russell alone
the door opens again
oh alright you can come
russell runs into the house past carl
russell pants panicked
he looks into living room
ive never been in a floating house before
carl follows russell into the living room
russell chuckles and points at the photo of young ellie
look at this stuff
russell finds ellies house drawing sitting on the pages of the open atlas
wow you going on a trip
reads from the engraving paradise falls a land lost in time
you going to south america mr
carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket
dont touch that
youll soil it
you know most people take a plane but youre smart because youll have all your tv and clocks and stuff
russell runs over to the steering rig
is this how you steer your house
does it really work
kid would you stop with the russell steers and the house tilts knocking carl back and forth
oh this makes it go right and that ways left
let go of the knock it off
russell looks out the window in front of him
hey look buildings
russell and carl arrive at the window
that buildings so close i could almost touch it
that gives carl an idea
carl lowers russell on a rope below the floating house
this is great
you should try this mr
look theres a bus that could take me home two blocks away
looking up hey i can see your house from here
struggling to hold on dont jerk around so much kid
the rope slips through carls hands
carl stands beside russell at the window
russells fall had been a daydream
well thats not gonna work
carl leaves russell at the window
i know that cloud its a cumulo nimbus
did you know that the cumulo nimbus
grumbling carl kneels at the fireplace to cut a few balloon strings with his housekeys
stayed up all night blowing up balloons for what
warm air goes by cool air and the airs go by each other and thats how we get lightning
thats nice kid
carl turns off his hearing aid
russell tries to get carls attention
a storm is brewing in the distance
nearly silent mr
fredricksen theres a big storm coming
its starting to get scary
were gonna get blown to bits
were in big trouble mr
a huge lightning bolt flash lights up the room
carl turns on his hearing aid
what are you doing over there
carl joins russell at the window
the tiny house is heading for a massive storm
carl struggles to steer the house away but is blown into the storm
the steering mechanism recoils and sends carl flying
plates fall from the walls and furniture slides as the house is rocked in the storm
russells backpack slides toward the front door
russell hops on top of the backpack
the pack slides toward the open front door
hes about to slide out when the house tilts and the door swings shut
the paradise falls jar rolls past carl
he chases after it
ellies chair slides across the room
carl gasps and runs to protect it
the photo of ellie rocks and slides off the wall
carl lunges to catch it
the storm rages
the house is tossed into the storm clouds
all goes black
carl is asleep
a finger pokes carls face
the finger pokes carls face again
carl wakes up
i thought you were dead
carl struggles to rise from the pile of ellies things hed been protecting
i steered us
i steered the house
after you tied your stuff down you took a nap so i went ahead and steered us down here
carl opens the window and looks out
the house floats motionless above an ocean of clouds
cant tell where we are
oh were in south america all right
it was a cinch with my wilderness explorer gps
russell holds up his wilderness explorer gps unit
my dad gave it to me
it shows exactly where we are on the planet
with this baby well never be lost
russell gestures tossing the unit out the window
carl and russell watch the tiny gps unit descend into the clouds
carl kneels by the fireplace and cuts at the balloon strings
well get you down find a bus stop
you just tell the man you want to go back to your mother
sure but i dont think they have busses in paradise falls
a small cluster of balloons fly up and away from the house
that ought to do it
here ill give you some change for bus fare
russell follows carl toward the front door
nah ill just use my city bus pass
the house lowers into the fog
whoah thats gonna be like a billion transfers to get back to my house
carl and russell stand on the porch as the house moves down into and through the thick dark clouds
fredricksen how much longer
well were up pretty high
could take hours to get down
something flashes by them in the fog
carl leans forward
that thing was
building or something
another dark object whooshes past them
what was that mr
we cant be close to the ground yet
a brief view of rocks directly below them
the house crashes into the ground
russell and carl fly off the porch and onto the ground
they land hard
carls house is floating away
carl runs after the garden hose dragging across the ground
no dont dont dont
carl grabs the hose and is pulled up in the air
russell jumps onto carls leg and the extra weight pulls them to the ground
russell hang on
carl and russell slide toward the edge of a cliff edge
they slide toward the edge
the drop is thousands of feet
carl is terrified
russell pulls carl by the leg away from the cliff edge
carl still hanging from the hose looks around
fog blankets the mysterious landscape revealing only scattered rocks
out of breath where
where are we
this doesnt look like the city or the jungle mr
the wind picks up and they struggle against it
to house dont worry ellie
i got it
the wind clears the fog slowly revealing a crescent shaped flat topped mountain on which they stand
across it some ten miles away is paradise falls
he cant believe it
there it is
ellie its so beautiful
the landscape is stunning
carl shows russell the engraving with the ellie drawing of the house atop the falls
we made it
we made it
russell we could float right over there
you mean assist you
okay ill climb up
russell climbs carl stepping on his leg arms and face
the hose jiggles as russell climbs out of frame
now when you get up there go ahead and hoist me up
russell continues to grunt and strain off screen
you on the porch yet
russell is just inches above carl still struggling to climb
he slides down onto carls head exhausted
i came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile
hey if i could assist you over there would you sign off on my badge
what are you talking about
we could walk your house to the falls
yeah after all we weigh it down
we could walk it right over there
like a parade balloon
carl considers this
the house floats against the sky
the hose descends from the house and y s to tie to both carl and russell
they wear the hose like a harness pulling the house as they walk
now were gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly with no rap music or flash dancing
russell inspects his surroundings
we have three days at best before the helium leaks out of those balloons
and if were not at the falls when that happens
were not getting to the falls
i found sand
carl rolls his eyes
he looks up at the house
dont you worry ellie
well get our house over there
russell looks up at the house
whos carl talking to
shrugs it off this is fun already isnt it
by the time we get there youre gonna feel so assisted
fredricksen if we happen to get separated use the wilderness explorer call
caw caw raaar
the wilderness explorer call sets off carls hearing aid
why are we going to paradise falls again
hey lets play a game
its called see who can be quiet the longest
my mom loves that game
they head toward paradise falls some miles away
mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape
something tall blasts through a maze of rocks
two dark shapes are chasing the prey
each has a light
the prey dodges various traps one after another
a metal cage slams shut a hidden net darts on a trip wire
the prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks a dead end
the hunters surround the prey stepping out into the light a sinister doberman pinscher a rottweiler and a bulldog each wearing large high tech collars
they surround the prey
escape looks impossible
the bird moves impossibly fast jumping over the three dogs and escaping in a flash
the dogs head off in pursuit
a high pitched squeal stops the dogs short their ears wincing in pain
they whimper and run off
carl steps out from behind a shrub
the squealing is in fact his hearing aid
calling back cmon russell would you hurry it up
russell plods forward dragging his feet
and my knee hurts
my elbow hurts and i have to go to the bathroom
i asked you about that five minutes ago
well i didnt have to go then
russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt
i dont want to walk anymore
can we stop
if you dont hurry up the tigers will eat you
theres no tigers in south america
russell rolls over to show carl a badge
oh for the love of pete
go on into the bushes and do your business
here hold my stuff
somehow energized russell jams his pack into carls hands secures his rope to a tree and tromps off into the shrubs
he goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand and a pile of leaves in another
ive always wanted to try this
carl waits standing by the tree his house is tied to
am i supposed to dig the hole before or after
none of my concern
carl covers his ears
russell pats down a mound and sighs in satisfaction
he is about to return to carl when he spots some tracks
russell follows the tracks into the dark jungle clapping
come on out snipe
the footprints continue for a time then stop
russell munches on a chocolate bar
something rustles in the bushes behind him
he turns to look
behind him a beak takes a nibble of the chocolate and zips out
russell peers into the shrub
dont be afraid little snipe
i am a wilderness explorer so i am a friend to all of nature
want some more
russell holds out the chocolate
the beak pokes out and nibbles
dont eat it all
come on out
the beak zips back into the bushes
dont be afraid little snipe
good little snipe
a massive shadowy creature rises up over russell
carl checks the knot on his hose harness
russell and the massive creature step up behind him
i found the snipe
humoring him oh did you
are they tall
oh yes theyre very tall
do they have a lot of colors
they do indeed
do they like chocolate
oh ye chocolate
carl turns to look
next to russell stands a foot tall multicolored bird
what is that thing
its a snipe
theres no such thing as a snipe
but you said snipes eat carl grabs russell pulling him away from the bird
the bird hisses at carl and grabs russell back
it cradles russell like a baby
carl pokes at the bird with his cane trying to scare it off
go on get out of here
the bird hisses
it takes russell up into a tree swinging him around playfully
it looks scary and fun
hey look mr
fredricksen it likes me
the bird grooms russell
no stop that tickles
carl pokes the bird with his cane
get out of here
go on git
the bird sets russell down
it stalks carl hissing and ruffling its feathers
no no no no no kevin its okay
fredricksen is nice
russell pats carl on the head
yeah thats his name i just gave him
the bird pats carl on the head with its beak
carl waves his cane
the bird eats it
the bird chokes and the cane comes back up
get out of here
carl shoos the bird away
the bird mimics him
go on beat it
grumbling carl gives up and throws his hands in the air
the bird mimics this as well
can we keep him
ill get the food for him ill walk him ill change his newspapers
an explorer is a friend to all be it plants or fish or tiny mole
that doesnt even rhyme
yeah it does
russell points up to the roof of carls house
youre not allowed up there
the bird is on carls roof
it swallows a balloon
the bird coughs up the deflated balloon
you come down here right now
the bird jumps down and hides behind russell
can you believe this ellie
russell contd uh hey ellie could i keep the bird
to carl she said for you to let me
to ellie but i told him no catches himself i told you no
the bird hisses at carl
carl and russell pull the house through the mist
russell discreetly drops chocolate pieces along their trail
the bird follows eating
i see you back there
it hides behind a rock still totally visible
go on get out of here
go annoy someone else for a while
hey are you okay over there
the bird dashes away
carl and russell look around
in the midst some feet away they see the figure of a man
carl walks toward the man
its nice to know someone else is up here
i can smell you
you can smell us
i can smell you
as they get closer they realize the man is in fact a rock
you were talking to a rock
russell points to another rock shape
hey that one looks like a turtle
look at that one
that one looks like a dog
the rock walks forward
it is a dog
uh were not allowed to have dogs in my apartment
the dog nuzzles russell who nervously pets it
hey i like dogs
calls out we have your dog
to self wonder who he belongs to
the dog sits
hey look hes trained
the dog raises his paw and russell shakes it
carl and russell freeze
did that dog just say hi there
carl jumps back
my name is dug
i have just met you and i love you
dug jumps up on to carl
dug wears a high tech collar
the dogs thoughts come out of it as words through a speaker
it can talk
unfortunately it talks non stop
my master made me this collar
he is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that i may talk squirrel
dug stares transfixed at a tree
my master is good and smart
its not possible
oh it is because my master is smart
what do these do boy
he inspects the collar and twists a dial
hey would you cuerdo con tigo i use that collar watashi wa hanashi ma to talk with i would be happy if you stopped
russell dont touch that
it could be radioactive or something
dug sniffs the ground around carl and russell
i am a great tracker
my pack sent me on a special mission all by myself
have you seen a bird
i want to find one and i have been on the scent
i am a great tracker did i mention that
the bird tackles dug and hisses
hey that is the bird
i have never seen one up close but this is the bird
to carl may i take your bird back to camp as my prisoner
and on the way learn how to bark like a real dog
oh i can bark
and heres howling
the bird hisses at dug
can we keep him
please please please
russell falls to his knees pleading
but its a talking dog
its just a weird trick or something
lets get to the falls
carl grabs russell
the bird follows as does dug
please be my prisoner
oh please oh please be my prisoner
a dogs nose follows the tracks
this is gamma a bulldog
oh here it is
i picked up the birds scent
a second dog beta a rottweiler
wait a minute wait a minute
what is this
i smell chocolate
im getting prunes and denture cream
who are they
ah man master will not be pleased
wed better tell him someone took the bird right alpha
alpha a doberman pinscher sits with his back to them
high pitched voice no
soon enough the bird will be ours yet again
alphas voice is high and squeaky as if hes breathed in helium
find the scent my compadres and you two shall have much rewardings from master for the toil factor you wage
beta and gamma look at each other
hey alpha i think theres something wrong with your collar
you must have bumped it
yeah your voice sounds funny
beta and gamma laugh
they stop laughing
mayhaps you desire to squirrel
all three dogs look for the squirrel
mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that i have been assigned by my strength and cunning
but maybe dug would
you might want to ask him
beta and gamma snicker derisively
yeah i wonder if hes found the bird on his very special mission
do not mention dug to me at this time
his fools errand will keep him most occupied most occupied indeed
ha ha ha
do you not agree with that which i am saying to you now
sure but the second master finds out you sent dug out by himself none of us will get a treat
you are wise my trusted lieutenant
alpha powers up a video screen on betas collar
this is alpha calling dug
come in dug
the screen shows ground moving past the view from dugs collar
hey your voice sounds funny
i know i know
have you seen the bird
why yes the bird is my prisoner now
the screen view adjusts to see the bird
where are you
i am here with the bird and i will bring it back and then you will like me
oh gotta go
on the collar screen the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a boys face
on video screen hey dug
who you talking to
the video screen goes blank
the dogs bark excitedly
whats dug doing
whys he with that small mailman
where are they
alpha pushes a button on betas collar
a tracking device locates dug
there he is
the dogs sprint off into the jungle
the bird drags dug still clamped onto its leg
oh please oh please oh please be my prisoner
dug stop bothering kevin
that man there says i can take the bird and i love that man there like he is my master
the bird hisses
i am not your master
the bird tries to shake dug off its leg
dug jumps up on it
i am warning you once again bird
i am jumping on you now bird
russell tries to separate them which pulls on carls tether
at this rate well never get to the falls
carl pulls on the tether knocking russell over
carl falls pulling the house into a tall rock
he turns his anger to the group
i am nobodys master got it
points to bird i dont want you here points to dug and i dont want you here
points to russell im stuck with you
and if you two dont clear out of here by the time i count to three dug sees the tennis balls on carls cane
oh boy oh boy
carl pops off one of the tennis balls
you want it boy
oh oh oh
yes i do
i do ever so want the ball
go get it
carl throws the ball far away
dug chases after it
oh boy oh boy
i will get it and then bring it back
quick russell give me some chocolate
just give it to me
carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird
carl throws the chocolate
the bird runs after it
carl grabs russell and runs
carl pulls them down a slope
above the tree line the house smashes into a tree
carl and russell crossing the river balance on rocks
carl slips and his foot goes into the water
what are we doing
carl pushes through thick jungle leaves
bugs buzz around him
carl climbs up the hill
he falls over a dead branch
hey uh were pretty far now
kevins gonna miss me
they climb over a ridge
dug and the bird are nowhere in sight
carl sits down on a rock breathing hard
i think that did the trick
with the ball in his mouth
carl turns the other way
it honks at him
dug drops the slobbery ball on carls lap
a clap of thunder
lightning flashes reveal rain pouring down on the house
beneath it carl and russell are kept dry sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire
carl looks at dug asleep wrapped around the birds leg
he rolls his eyes and looks up at the house
well thanks for keeping us dry anyway ellie
which ones the front
russell struggles to set up the tent
he reads his manual
is this step three or step five
carl rolls his eyes at russells ineptness
russell struggles with a tent pole trying to winch it into place
carl cant watch
an off screen smack
russell walks to carl
miraculously he looks unscathed
russell turns revealing a large red welt on his face
pointing to tent thats for you
the tent pole springs loose catapulting the tent over the cliff
tents are hard
wait arent you super wilderness guy
with the gpms and the badges
can i tell you a secret
alright here goes
i never actually built a tent before
i said it
youve been camping before havent you
well never outside
well why didnt you ask your dad how to build a tent
i dont think he wants to talk about this stuff
why dont you try him sometime
maybe hell surprise you
well hes away a lot
i dont see him much
hes got to be home sometime
well i called but phyllis told me i bug him too much
you call your own mother by her first name
phyllis isnt my mom
carl realizes he put his foot in it
the two sit silently together watching the fire
but he promised hed come to my explorer ceremony to pin on my assisting the elderly badge so he can show me about tents then right
carl studies russells sad optimism
he looks at the missing badge on russells sash
hey uh why dont you get some sleep
dont want to wake up the traveling flea circus
dug nuzzles around the sleeping birds leg
fredricksen dug says he wants to take kevin prisoner
we have to protect him
russell yawns and lies down on the rock next to carl
can kevin go with us
he can come
promise you wont leave him
cross your heart
carl looks down at russell
cross my heart
carl sits at the campfire the others asleep
he shakes his head and looks up at the house
what have i got myself into ellie
a frog sits next to carls glasses
carls hand smacks it like an alarm clock
the frog hops away
carl rises looking up at the house
the balloons on the house are wilting
we better get moving
he scans the camp
the bird is gone
maybe russell wont notice
calls out alright everybody up
russell sits up with a snort
hes wandered off
dug find kevin
dug crazily searches and sniffs looking for the bird
find the bird
find the bird
dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and points to the left
there he is
russell points to the right
the bird is on top of carls house
dug turns around
the bird has gathered a pile of food on carls roof
hey thats my food
get off my roof
yeah get off of his
in the distance baby birds call out
the bird calls back
what is it doing
the bird is calling to her babies
kevins a girl
the bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof
her house is over there in those twisty rocks
miles off is a huge grouping of rocks the labyrinth
the baby birds call from somewhere inside
she has been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them
the bird hugs russell goodbye and pats carl on the head with her beak
she hisses at dug
wait kevins just leaving
but you promised to protect her
her babies need her we gotta make sure theyre together
the bird hurries off toward the labyrinth
carl gathers up the hose tether
weve lost enough time already
the bird rounds a corner and hears rustling in the bushes ahead
she scampers back toward the house
russell chews on some chocolate
this was her favorite chocolate
because you sent her away theres more for you
carl rolls his eyes and sighs
they hear rustling from the bushes behind them
beta and gamma run toward carl and russell viciously barking and growling
carl protects russell with his cane
dug is conflicted
alpha walks forward and stares menacingly at carl
he turns toward dug
high pitched voice wheres the bird
you said you had the bird
since i have said that i can see how you would think that
where is it
come back tomorrow and then i will again have the bird
alpha barks angrily
you lost it
why do i not have a surprised feeling
well at least you now have lead us to the small mailman and the one who smells of prunes
carl and russell look at dug
he turned on them
dug shamefully lowers his head
master will be most pleased we have found them and will ask of them many questions
commanding to carl come
wait were not going with you
were going to the falls
gamma and beta bark fiercely at carl
get away from me
the dogs lead carl and russell like prisoners
the house is pulled after them and on the roof the bird
alpha leads carl and russell through a canyon
dogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls
four more large dogs join the group
carl and russell watch warily and continue their march
they round a bend
before them is a massive cave opening
the house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group approaches the huge cave opening
dozens of dogs step out of the cave
carl and russell stop
more dogs approach from the side
every way carl turns there are more dogs
growling and snarling the dogs surround carl and russell
from the darkness a voice stay
the dogs stop
a figure peers out from the darkness
it examines carl russell and the floating house
you came here in that
in a house
a floating house
the man laughs
carl and russell laugh along nervously
that is the darndest thing ive ever seen
youre not after my bird are you
but if you need to borrow a cup of sugar id be happy to oblige
the dogs laugh uproariously at the mans joke
well this is all a misunderstanding
my dogs made a mistake
the figure walks out toward carl into the light
carl recognizes him
wait are you charles muntz
the charles muntz
muntz gives him the thumbs up
adventure is out there
carl giggles with glee
its really him
to russell thats charles muntz
whos charles muntz
it is him
im carl fredricksen
my wife and i we were your biggest fans
carl rushes to shake muntzs hand
muntz is charmed
well youre a man of good taste
muntz laughs at his joke
carl joins in
you must be tired
to dogs attention everyone
these people are no longer intruders
they are our guests
the dogs cheer
i like you temporarily
you do smell like prunes
i will not bite you
muntz walks into the cave
carl and russell excitedly follow
carls eyes adjust to the dark
muntzs dirigible the spirit of adventure is tethered in the cave
im sorry about the dogs hope they werent too rough on you
go ahead and moor your airship right next to mine
muntz gestures to a pylon where carl ties off the house
muntz and the dogs walk up the gangplank of the dirigible
were not actually going inside the spirit of adventure itself
would you like to
carl giggles like a little boy
wait up mr
carl and russell follow up the ramp
dug follows but is blocked by alpha and beta
what do we do with dug
he has lost the bird
put him in the cone of shame
alpha gamma and beta walk into the dirigible
dug sits forlornly with a plastic cone around his neck
i do not like the cone of shame
carl and russell are speechless as they walk into the room
its a treasure trove of giant skeletons stuffed creatures and rare cultural artifacts
various servant dogs dust and polish as muntz leads carl and russell through the room
most of the collection is housed in the worlds top museums new york munich london
course i kept the best for myself
did you ever
will you look at that
oh yes the arsinoitherium
beast charged while i was brushing my teeth
used my shaving kit to bring him down
a dog approaches carrying a menu
muntz waves it off
oh surprise me
to carl only way to get it out of ethiopia at the time was to have it declared as dental equipment
behind him a dog cant resist gnawing at one of the bones
oh my gosh the giant somalian leopard tortoise
oh you recognize it
thats an interesting story there
a dog approaches with a bottle of champagne in his mouth
muntz glances at the bottle
hm excellent choice
to carl i found it on safari with roosevelt
two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle
they sloppily pour two glasses
he and i fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings
and did he cheat
oh he was horrible
muntz and carl laugh
high pitched voice master dinner is ready
oh dear broken translator
its that loose wire again
leans down fixes it there you go big fella
deep scary voice thank you master
i liked his other voice
well dinner is served
right this way
muntz leads carl and russell into the dining room and up to a large table
so how are things stateside
almost tempted to go back a few times but i have unfinished work here
dogs pull back chairs for them
dog waiters place napkins on their laps
i hope youre hungry because epsilon is the finest chef ive ever had
dogs bring out covered plates look at each other and remove the silver plate covers at the same time
the meals look delicious
oh epsilon youve done it again
russell is served a hot dog
his waiter cant resist and eats a bite
another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his glass
carl looks around still enthralled
oh my ellie would have loved all this
you know its because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by paradise falls
he gestures toward his house tethered outside the porthole window
and now youve made it
youre sure were not a bother
id hate to impose
its a pleasure to have guests a real treat
the dogs erupt into excited barking
i want a treat
no no quiet
in the excitement a dog swipes the rest of russells hot dog
shouldntve used that word
having guests is a delight
more often i get thieves come to steal whats rightfully mine
muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room
they called me a fraud those
but once i bring back this creature my name will be cleared
the lantern illuminates photographs drawings samples feathers
hundreds of them
all of the bird
this is muntzs obsession
he looks over to a full size skeleton
beautiful isnt it
ive spent a lifetime tracking it
sometimes years go by between sightings
muntz contd ive tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives
cant go in after it
once in theres no way out
lost so many dogs
muntz is lost in reverie
and here they come these bandits and think the bird is theirs to take
but they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place
distracted russell finally notices the skeleton
hey that looks like kevin
thats my new giant bird pet
i trained it to follow us
muntz and alpha exchange glances
she likes chocolate
russell holds up a chocolate bar to show muntz
yeah i gave her some of my chocolate
she goes ga ga for it
carl swipes the chocolate from russell and pockets it
but it ran off
its gone now
he walks to a table full of flight helmets
you know carl
these people who pass through here they all tell pretty good stories
a surveyor making a map
using his cane muntz topples a helmet from the table
it rolls across the floor
a botanist cataloguing plants
muntz topples another helmet
he lifts a third to show carl
an old man taking his house to paradise falls
he drops the helmet
it rolls to carls feet
thats the best one yet
i cant wait to hear how it ends
carl glances around nervously
out the window sitting on the roof of his house sits the well
its been a wonderful evening but wed better be going
carl gets up and pulls russell from the table
oh youre not leaving
we dont want to take advantage of your hospitality
come on russell
carl leads russell toward the door
but we havent even had dessert yet
muntz follows behind them slowly menacingly
no the boys right
you havent had dessert
epsilon here makes a delicious cherries jubilee
carl pulls russell along muntz following behind like something out of a bad dream
oh you really must stay
we have so much more to talk about
a distant haunted wail
muntz walks to the window and looks out
atop the roof he sees the bird
he turns back to carl
but theyre gone
to dogs get them
carl and russell untie carls house from the pylon
i am hurrying
dogs descend down the ramp behind them
carl and russell run toward the cave opening
dogs block the cave opening
carl stops short
master over here
dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave
carl and russell run toward him
the cave leads to a steep incline
the dogs are getting closer
theres no choice but to jump
the lift from the overhead balloons allows carl and russell to leap down the incline like astronauts
go toward the light master
dogs climb down the rocks closing in on carl and russell
the bird sees the dogs
she jumps off the house and lifts carl and russell on her back
she runs through the cave towing the house behind her
russell and carl hang on for dear life
bang bang bang
balloons pop as they scrape across the ceiling
the house lowers
ahead a giant rock sits in their path
carl tugs at the house but it crashes against the rock pulling russell onto the ground
dragging on the ground russell gets bumped around badly
the dogs close in on russell
alpha bites at his heels
carl fends off alpha with his cane
alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down
the dogs stop short
carl looks back as the bird keeps running
dug is up on the canyon wall
he caused the avalanche
go on master
i will stop the dogs
dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs
stop you dogs
the dogs run around dug
alpha bites dug by the neck and throws him out of the path
the bird carries carl russell dragging along behind
she rounds a corner
russell swings out over the abyss
the bird jumps from rock spire to spire
russell swings back and forth wildly in the air
russell does the wilderness explorer call
gimme your hand
carl holds out his cane so that russell can grab it and carl pulls him back onto the bird
meanwhile dug manages to rejoin his friends but just in time to reach the end of the line a cliff edge
a river winds feet below
carl looks above to see the houses momentum pulling forward
hang on to kevin
carl grabs onto kevin and picks dug up by the collar
just as the dogs reach our gang the houses momentum carries them across the chasm
alpha bites the bird on the leg but is kicked loose and falls into the river below
carl lands hard but safely across the river chasm
the dogs are stuck on the other side
carl painfully gets up
he looks up at his house
its still intact
he breathes a sigh of relief
the bird tries to stand but squawks pitifully and falls back to the ground
russell rushes to her side
the birds leg has been injured badly by the dog bite
she cant stand
russell applies a bandage
from the distant labyrinth of rocks the bird babies call
kevin calls back to them
she tries to stand but cant
russell runs to her side
no no no
to carl shes hurt real bad
cant we help her get home
carl looks at the birds wounds
he looks to the rock maze then to his house
he knows the right thing to do
and he hates himself for it
but weve got to hurry
dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing muntz
you lost them
uh it was dug
yeah hes with them
he helped them escape
muntz snarls in anger
wait a minute
he leans over a radar tracking device
dugs collar screen powers on and a signal zeroes in on dugs location
dug oblivious looks out over the landscape sniffing
carl and russell peek out from behind a tree
no my pack is not following us
boy they are dumb
dug scampers back to carl and russell who pull the house from behind a tree canopy
this is crazy
i finally meet my childhood hero and hes trying to kill us
what a joke
hey i know a joke
a squirrel walks up to a tree and says i forgot to store acorns for winter and now i am dead
it is funny because the squirrel gets dead
they pull the house keeping it hidden behind the trees
the house bumps into a tree jostling the injured bird on the porch
you okay kevin
kevin goes back to sleep
russell looks at her bandaged leg
you know what mr
the wilderness isnt quite what i expected
i mean its not how they made it sound in my book
hmm get used to that kid
my dad made it sound so easy
hes really good at camping and how to make fire from rocks and stuff
he used to come to all my sweatlodge meetings
russell smiles at the thought
and afterwards wed go get ice cream at fentons
i always get chocolate and he gets butter brickle
then wed sit on this one curb right outside and ill count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones and whoever gets the most wins
i like that curb
he looks up at carl
that might sound boring but i think the boring stuff is the stuff i remember the most
they walk in silence
the bird babies call out in the distance
kevin calls back
look there it is
russell spots the labyrinth now close by
he tries to run but is pulled back by his tether
laughing carl unclips russells tether
hold on russell stand still
carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree securing the house
russell helps kevin off the porch and the group run toward the labyrinth entrance
kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies
she runs off ahead
carl and russell laugh
look at that bird go
wait up you overgrown chicken
thats it go kevin
go find your babies
just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth a fierce spotlight hits them
muntzs dirigible lowers overhead
a net shoots out and binds her
she falls and calls out
the net catches on a rock
carl and russell run to her aid
russell give me your knife
carl saws frantically at the net
get away from my bird
muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible
beside them a group of dogs drag forward carls house
muntz hurls a lit lantern
flames burst up beneath the house
heat waves ripple up
carls house lowers into the fire
inside the living room ellies photo crashes to the floor
he rushes toward the house dropping the knife
muntz motions to the dogs
they swarm past russell knocking him down and grabbing the bird in the net
carl pulls his house away from the flames
the bird calls out plaintively as the dogs drag her into the dirigible
muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible
we want her in good shape for my return
let her go
russell runs after the dogs but the gangplank closes
the dirigible flies off
carl beats out the flames with his jacket
he extinguishes the flames
carl collapses on the side of his house
you gave away kevin
you just gave her away
this is none of my concern
i didnt ask for any of this
i am not your master
and if you hadnt a shown up none of this would have happened
dug slinks off tail between his legs
carl angrily puts on the harness
now whether you assist me or not i am going to paradise falls if it kills me
he walks off
russell falls in behind
an angry dawn breaks
now barely aloft carl pulls the house across the rocky landscape
russells harness drags along side empty
russell walks behind
with the last of his energy carl drags the house into place
the house groans as it comes to rest
carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff
he looks over
hes finally made it paradise falls
torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge
carl takes out ellies childhood drawing
next to him stands the real house just like ellie wanted
behind him russell throws his sash on the ground
i dont want this anymore
russell walks away
he sits on a rock alone
carl picks up the sash
he walks up the steps of his house
the door opens
carl steps in
hes back in his house for the first time in days
carl and ellies things are strewn across the floor a mess from the rough journey
carl rights ellies chair sets the lamp upright slides the table into position
he pushes their two chairs back into their place
carl closes his eyes takes a deep breath and sits
nothing save the distant sound of the falls outside
carl surveys the room
the adventure book rests on a table near him
he opens it and puts ellies drawing back
he looks through the pages remembering the newspaper clippings and old photographs the dreams of young ellie
he turns to the page marked stuff im going to do
he managed to bring the house to the falls but ellie never made it
he closes the book
but as he does carl sees something he hadnt before
the blank pages at the end are no longer blank
a wedding photo of the two of them
on a picnic
another and another
photos of their ordinary life together the ups and downs
carls face warms
ellie lived the life she wanted she saw adventure in everyday life
a photo of the two of them sitting side by side together in their chairs
beneath it ellie has written carl smiles
he looks over to ellies empty chair
on the arm is russells sash
carl picks it up
he looks to ellies chair
he crosses his heart
carl walks from the house and calls from the porch
but russell is nowhere to be seen
a shadow crosses carl
he looks up to see russell floating off hanging from a bunch of balloons
im gonna help kevin even if you wont
russell fires up a leaf blower and steers himself off into the sky
carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift it
he struggles but the house doesnt budge
the balloons have lost too much helium
furious he throws a chair off his porch
it lands atop the mountain rocks with a thud
this gives him an idea
the gramophone smashes onto the rocky ground
chairs dressers tables carl throws them all out of the house
slowly one corner of the house lifts
carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch
the house lifts off
the house floats off into the sky leaving a huge pile of things
beside it sits carl and ellies chairs side by side atop paradise falls
the house soars into the air sails billowing
inside the house carl adjusts his steering scans the skies
knock knock knock
carls eyes go wide
the door swings open
i was hiding under your porch because i love you
can i stay
can you stay
well youre my dog arent you
and im your master
you are my master
dug lunges forward and overwhelms carl with dog kisses
the house flies off into the sky
good boy dug
youre a good boy
russell steers through the clouds toward the dirigible
dogs play poker
behind them russell flies past with the leaf blower
they turn to look
russell steers wobbly toward an open dirigible window
he smashes into the wall
he tries again and tumbles through the window
russell releases the balloons and picks up the leaf blower ready for action
dont worry kevin
ill save growling dogs move toward him
russell blows the leaf blower at the dogs
muntz stares into the birds cage mesmerized
shes miserable and scared
and they wouldnt believe me
just wait till they get a look at you
the small mailman has returned
dogs tie russell to a chair
let me go
wheres your elderly friend
russell blows the leaf blower in muntzs face
hes not my friend anymore
muntz grabs the leaf blower and drags russell out
well if youre here fredricksen cant be far behind
muntz drags russell through the trophy room
where are you keeping kevin
muntz sets russell down and walks to a control panel
let me go
scream all you want small mailman
none of your mailman friends can hear you
ill unleash all my wilderness explorer training
muntz is about to throw a switch when he looks out the porthole
flying toward him is carls house
fredricksens coming back
guard that bird
if you see the old man you know what to do
muntz pulls the switch and walks out of the room
hey where are you going
im not finished with you
nice talking with you
muntz slams the door
light emerges from the floor
russell is on the ramp which is opening
muntz enters the cockpit and takes the wheel
where are you fredricksen
the dirigible turns revealing carls house sneaking up behind
carl steers toward the cockpit
he dons russells sash then hooks his cane onto his back
hes fighting for a cause
he hears screaming
tied to his chair he slides down the ramp as it lowers closer and closer to the edge
carl steers his house to the dirigible
carl flings the hose hooking it to the ramp railing
using his cane as a zip line carl slides to russell catching him just as russell slides off the ramp edge
they land safely together
bring er over
dug winches in the hose caddy pulling the house closer to the dirigible ramp
carl carries russell into the house
carl sets russell still bound down in the front hall
you came back for kevin
lets go get her
im getting kevin
you stay here
but i want to help
i dont want your help
i want you safe
carl leaps back into the dirigible
russell struggles against his bonds
carl and dug sneak down a hall
they see dogs ahead and hide
how do we get past these dogs
dug points to a grate in the wall
dug leads carl backstage through a vent shaft into the dirigible
they sneak past two biplanes
they emerge through a grate near the ceiling
they look down into the room where the bird is kept in a cage
the bird recognizes carl and cries out
dont worry kevin were on our way
alpha enters leading a group of dogs
carl and dug duck into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above
allow no one to be entering through these doors
guard well that bird my minions
what do we do now dug
dug is lost in ecstacy chomping on a tennis ball on the end of carls cane
carl drops down from the ceiling and stands on the cage
he bangs his cane
all the dogs turn
he grabs a ball from his cane and waves it in the air
who wants the ball
i want the ball
then go get it
carl throws the ball
the dogs scramble after it
the dogs pile into the hallway in pursuit
im gonna get there first
oh gonna get the ball
im gonna get it
gamma catches it
i got it
behind them carl shuts the door
the dogs realize their mistake
carl opens the cage door
im sorry kevin
lets get you out of here
muntz scans the horizon
suddenly the in ship communicator comes to life
on radio master
the old man
hes got the bird
the birds gone
one at a time
russell struggles to break free of the chair
i want to help
he manages to get his arms free
except that all his struggling causes the chair to hop out on the porch and fall off
russell screams as he falls
the hose unspools
russell reaches the end of the hose
russell grabs onto it and the chair jostles free falling thousands of feet down
the house drifts away from the dirigible
the melee of conflicting reports from the dogs continues
hes in hall d
hes in hall b
its the old man
does anyone know where they are
on cue russell splats into the dashboard window of the control room and squeegees across dangling from the hose
muntz stares slack jawed
the house floats off
into radio grey leader
take down the house
russell clings to the end of the hose swaying in the wind
whats that noise
from beneath the dirigible emerges
from beneath the dirigible three spitfire airplanes emerge
as they get closer it is clear they are being flown by dogs
into radio grey leader checking in
grey checking in
grey checking in
the planes fall into formation and fly toward the house
the dog squadron leader bites down on a squeaky bone chew toy that fires poison darts
the biplanes fire and strafe carls house with darts
russell screams swaying beneath it on the hose
carl dug and the bird escape through the trophy room
come on kevin
behind the door muntz is waiting for them
he grabs a sword from the wall display and attacks
dug hears and bites muntz on the leg
muntz kicks dug loose and out the door
he slams it shut
locked out dug jumps on the door and barks
he hears growling and turns around
there stands alpha and the other dogs
the dogs give chase
muntz swings his sword at carl but misses
carl uses his cane to defend himself
muntz smashes his trophy collection as he swings for carl
his sword gets stuck in a mounted skeleton
carl swings his cane and hits muntz on the head
the tennis balls bounce the cane off muntz and smack carl in the face
muntz pulls the sword free
he raises the sword over his head to strike and his back cracks loudly
carl raises his cane over his head and his back cracks too
carl and muntz struggle to move
muntz cracks his back free and kicks carl in the chest knocking him against a trophy
he has the upper hand now
he throttles him with his arm and lifts his sword
any last words fredricksen
come on spit it out
carl spits his false teeth at muntz
he falls backwards
carl collects his teeth and motions for kevin
muntz advances on carl who struggles to protect the bird
muntz is a wild man now smashing and destroying anything that gets in his way
im taking that bird back with me alive or dead
carl trips and falls to the floor
muntz is about to deal the final blow
meanwhile alpha backs dug into the control panel
he bumps a a lever
the entire dirigible rocks wildly to the side
muntz is knocked off balance
he slides to one side
trophy cases slide after him
the dirigible tilts to the other side
the broken trophy cases barrel straight toward carl
carl is thrown into a window which bursts open
carl falls through but manages to grab the frame with his cane
he dangles out over open air
he sees the biplanes circling the house russell hanging beneath it
the ship corrects again
carl climbs back inside
muntz comes at carl
come on kevin
carl climbs the work ladder up the side of the dirigible
he pushes the bird along as he goes
muntz follows up
alpha throws dug viciously across the room
alpha throws him again and dug crashes into the steering wheel knocking a radar shade off the control panel
alpha moves in
dug hides behind the steering wheel
i will have many enjoyments for what i am about to do dug
alpha lunges at dug through the steering wheel
dug cowers but then notices the radar shade
as alpha lunges again dug jams the shade over alphas head
alphas head is stuck trapped by the cone
the dogs all gasp
he wears the cone of shame
high pitched voice what
do not just continue sitting
the bump caused his collar to go funny again
the dogs all howl with laughter
high pitched voice no
stop your laughing
get this off of me
listen you dog
surprised at dugs moxy alpha sits
all other dogs sit too
i am not alpha he is oohhhh
russell tries to climb the hose
his hands are about to give out
the biplanes head straight at russell
out of breath i cant do it
behind him carl is climbing the side of the dirigible for dear life muntz closing in
far in the distance russell
carl calls for help the wilderness explorer call
you leave mr
hes more machine than boy now
biplanes shooting the whole way he climbs up onto the porch
the biplanes close in
russell yells to them
pointing down squirrel
all the dog pilots snap to attention
wheres the squirrel
the planes dive crash into each other
the dog pilots parachute out
i hate squirrels
muntz grabs carls foot
carl defends himself with his cane knocking muntz off the ladder
muntz catches on to a rung of the ladder
he watches carl and the bird climb
muntz descends the ladder
carl and the bird make it to the top of the dirigible
suddenly a trap door opens
but its dug
dug jumps up on carl licking his face
the house bears down on them
they run to meet it
russell steers the house toward carl
the house slows and lowers atop the airship
carl hoists the bird up onto the porch
come on kevin
carl helps dug onto the porch
he climbs up himself
muntz appears on top of the dirigible with a rifle
a bullet blasts through carls balloon strings
a third of them break or shoot skyward
the house plummets crashing onto the dirigible
carl is thrown from the house onto the airship
the house slides toward the edge russell dug and kevin still inside
carl scrambles to grab the hose trailing from the sliding house
the house slides on to the dirigibles tail fin
holding the hose carl digs in his heels and is just able to stop it
the house teeters on the very edge of the tail fin
get out of there
russell dug and kevin run toward the front porch
a bullet smashes the door jam next to them
muntz storms toward the house
carl holds desperately to the hose
leave them alone
russell and others duck inside and slam the door
the house tilts threatening to tip off at any second
carl holds on for his life
muntz pounds on the door with the butt of the rifle
russell dug and kevin back away from the door
the house slides farther over the edge
carl struggles to hold on
the hose caddy is ripping free from the house
the bolts pop from the wooden siding
its about to go
russell dug and kevin run into the living room
muntz kicks the door
suddenly carl has an idea
hang on to kevin
dont let go of her
confused russell follows carls directions
he dug and the bird huddle together
muntz breaks through the door
he lifts his rifle and sights the bird
through the window carl yells out
carl holds aloft a bar of chocolate
kevin lunges pushing past muntz and knocking the rifle from his hands
muntz lunges after them
the hose caddy breaks free
kevin leaps through the window russell and dug hanging from her side
muntz leaps after them
but balloon strings tangle around his leg and pull him back
muntz hangs for a moment
its thousands of feet from the ground
panting carl is left holding the hose
he pulls himself toward the edge
the hose curves beneath the tail fin
finally it swings out
that was cool
russell and dug dangle from it sitting on kevin
the bird holds on to the hose with her beak
carl laughs relieved
dont jerk around so much kid
russell climbs up followed by the bird and dug
oh i am ready to not be up high
carl laughs heartily as dug jumps on him and licks his face
carl looks into the distance
his house now empty floats softly down into the clouds and disappears
sorry about your house mr
he puts his arm around russell
you know its just a house
carl russell dug and kevin stand on the tail of the airship floating off over the clouds
carl and russell hold and cuddle the baby birds
the babies peck at carls head
carl and russell laugh
look at you
youre so soft
kevin calls out waiting for the babies at the gate to the labyrinth
time to go
i wish i could keep one
the babies run to the bird
one stops to hiss at dug
carl has misplaced something
huh wheres my cane
i just had it here
kevin starts hacking
she coughs up the cane
babies start hacking too
they cough up tennis balls
you know what
a little gift from me to you
the bird family enters the labyrinth
carl and russell wave
the bird looks back toward carl and russell and calls out one last time before disappearing into the mist
carl and russell both wear matching leather flight helmets and goggles
carl gives a thumbs up
muntzs dirigible ascends into the sky
dug and all of muntzs dogs stick their heads out the dirigible windows barking as they fly into the sunset
and by receiving their badges the following explorers will graduate to senior explorers
each junior wilderness explorer stands next to his father
as the camp master announces the achievement he hands the father a badge who pins it to his sons sash
for extreme mountaineering lore
hands badge to dad for wild animal defensive arts
hands badge for assisting the elderly
russell is tanned and dirty
the camp master clears his throat uncomfortably
russell looks for his dad in the audience

carl takes his place next to russell

the camp master hands carl the badge and continues down the line
russell for assisting the elderly and for performing above and beyond the call of duty i would like to award you the highest honor i can bestow the ellie badge
carl pins the badge onto the missing spot on russells sash
its ellies grape soda pin
they salute each other
russell gives carl a hug
carl returns it
russells mom sits in the audience with dug
russell proudly shows her the badge
alright i think that covers everybody
so lets give a big explorer call to our brand new senior wilderness explorers
the camp master leads the audience in the wilderness explorer muntzs dogs sit in the back barking in approval
carl and russell sit on a curb licking ice cream cones
russell has chocolate and carl has butter brickle
cars pass by

overhead muntzs dirigible is parked its ladder in the handicapped parking spot
on top of paradise falls sits carls house just as ellie imagined it
