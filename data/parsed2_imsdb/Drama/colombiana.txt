the page of a notebook turns revealing neat cursive handwriting covers the comic
cataleya restrepo cat for short a contained very centered year old pretty but with a toughness sitting at the dining room table in a well kept but modest home with
windows that look out over the steep hillside favela attends to her notebook
on the window there are half a dozen beautiful orchid plants
the rare cataleya orchid
all around there are packed cartons suitcases
moving day is at hand
is your homework finished yet
working on it mama
her mother taking time off from packing comes over to cat and turns the page of the notebook to reveal the lara croft comic and its copy
you draw beautifully my love but if you want to be something in life you have to study
i am studying mama
i want to be a super hero
her mother turns the page back to the lessons
better to be a doctor
are we going to see uncle emilio
i dont know
just waiting to hear from your father
cat looks up at a picture on the wall of the family
cat her mother and her father
her face carries a bit of worry
i cant believe this
mid s a gentleman calm courteous impeccably dressed
at a table with bottle of liquor and two glasses don luis sits opposite
off to the side don luiss right hand man marco stands like any right hand unobtrusive
because i love you fabio
like a brother
and i love you don luis
like a brother
he turns to marco
can you believe this guy marco
we started when we were little
how old were we fabio
ten year old bastards stealing apples from the carts in the market
after all weve been through
and now were on top he wants to leave
luis im going to be honest with you

since then im not a hundred percent
and you cant do this thing if youre not a hundred percent
so youll take a rest
you know how many times we should have been dead
i dont even want to count

and what about the future of this thing we built

im going to miss you
and im going to miss you
enough of this sentimental bullshit
next well be crying like two old women

he pours the liquor into the glasses
to the future
they tap glasses
they shoot the liquor down
business is all clear
he hands don luis a computer disc
its all here
no other copies
you even have to ask
opens his arms
the two men embrace
close as brothers
make sure he doesnt get in too much trouble
adios don fabio
ill do my best
and with that fabio exits the garden
don luis watches him sad to see his friend go
sighs deeply pours himself a whiskey downs it turns to marco
kill this motherfucker
two men holding automatics in their laps sit in the back the driver in the front
they see fabio very contained calm walking towards them
the driver turns the engine on
fabio slips into the passenger seat
the car takes off
smashes the dashboard
over and over
he keeps banging the dash
not ok boss
this bastard thinks im an idiot
playing it all mellow and shit
if he would have yelled and screamed and threatened to kill my whole family it would have been ok
we have an hour to get out of here
off the nervous looks of the guys in the car
fabios car comes to a screeching halt
fabio exits to three other gunmen nervous on edge
the gunmen from the car take defensive positions
fabio runs up the stairs
cat is still at the table drawing when she hears the screeching of tires the fast footsteps outside
she senses a storm coming
fabio bursts in
his wife sees his tension filled face
weve got ten minutes
cataleya go pack
im packed mama
cat is strangely calm just sits at the table
watches as fabio takes the family picture off the wall pries the frame back extracts a small chip hidden inside the frame comes over to cat
listen to me my darling
just in case of anything
he holds the chip up
this is your passport
do you understand
he places the chip in her hand takes a card out of his pocket
you find yourself alone
you go to the address on this card
show it to the man at the front gate
i dont understand papa
you dont have to understand
you just have to listen and remember
as cat looks at the chip
as fabios men keep a sharp lookout two suvs come rolling down the street
their fingers work the triggers of their weapons
the two suvs roll up
the blacked out windows roll down
we want to see don fabio
hes not home
you mind if we wait
fabio writes on top of cats drawing rips the page off folds it puts it in her pocket removes a medal from around his neck drapes it over hers
and this will keep you safe
cat looks down at the medal
an imprint of a flower
the cataleya orchid
it comes from one place on earth
my mother your grandmother used to grow them
every morning i would wake up to the sight of them
the smell of them
thats why i named you after them
it reminds us of who we are
he kisses her on the forehead
his wife appears at the doorway with two suitcases
the man in the suv is on the phone
they said hes not home yet
he hangs up
puts his phone back in his pocket
walks up to fabios men
change of plans
he pulls out his gun shoots them point blank
as they are exiting the house through a rear door the shots ring out
they see another black suv rushing up the street
he pushes his family back inside
fabio runs to the window
sees his men on the losing end of a gun battle
as the men fall and others run up the stairs firing as they retreat toward the front door
the mother drops the suitcases and runs to the rear room
fabio comes over to the unnaturally calm cat
i love you very much
i love you too papa
reaches under the table where cat is sitting takes a gun strapped there
next to the gun is a big knife
and then footsteps coming fast outside draw his attention
his wife runs into the room toting two big assed assault rifles
she tosses one to fabio
both of them take up shooters positions facing the door
sitting at the table very still
facing the front door hands gripping their assault rifles sweat dripping down their faces chests heaving waiting waiting to blow anyone who comes through the door to kingdom come
but they never get the chance because
machine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the room tearing into their bodies before they even get one shot off
tearing the orchid plants there to shred
cat watches in mute disbelief shocked as her parents bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them twitch and dance like marionettes on wires
their blood splattering across the room across her
silence so complete it is deafening in its absence of any sound
cat just sits in her chair
and then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into the room their assault weapons trained on the only living thing in the room
you in the kitchen
you the bedroom
you the back
the gunmen scatter
marco has his inquisitive eye on cat who does not drop her eyes impossible to read
one of the gunman strides over to cat jams a gun to her head
cat does not move a muscle
does not blink
examines the frame fabio dug the chip out of
he chambers a round is about to pull the trigger
what are you doing
as the other gunmen begin to tear the house apart looking for something marco strides over to cat
the frame in his hand
don luis said kill everyone
he also said no names
she wont remember
he is about to pull the trigger
the gunman stops
shes a kid
what do you mean so what
you take a kid teach them they have value
the gunman takes his gun lifts cats lip looks at her teeth
i couldnt even get ten bucks for her in the street
the gunman is about to pull the trigger again
are you stupid or what
marco hands him some cash
heres twenty asshole
go do your job
scowling the gunman joins the others in ripping the house apart looking for something
marco calmly goes to the fridge takes out two bottles of water cracks the caps sets one down on front of cat as he sits opposite her
her hands are in her lap
remember me cataleya
cat shakes her head no
i was at your confirmation
my name is marco and i was a very good friend of your father
i see he gave you his medal
alluding to the medal around her neck
the cataleya orchid
this way you will always remember him
i know this is a terrible thing for you to have seen
all the while his men are searching frisking the bodies of the dead even tearing the heels off their shoes
some things are too complicated for a kid to understand
this is one of them
but i am going to try explain it and make it very simple for you
so you understand
now you know who don luis is
cat responds shakes her head yes
her hand slips imperceptibly under the table
touches the handle of the knife taped there
of course you do
he was your fathers best friend since theyre kids
hes like an uncle to you
you know he has always been good to your family dont you
again cat shakes her head
this house the food you eat the clothes you wear
even your school fees
all this comes from don luis
you know that
again cat shakes her head
but when someone is good to you and you are not good to them back then bad things happen
he alludes to the riddled bodies of her dead parents
cat looks from the bodies and back to marco no emotion in her eyes
i know you are a smart girl
you do well in school
so i know this is not too complicated for you to understand
am i right
now your father had something that belonged to don luis
a little thing
no bigger than
he holds up his thumbnail
maybe it was in this
he holds up the frame shows where the chip was dug out of the wood
do you know what i am talking about
gripping the knife handle
do you know where it is
well if you give it to me don luis will be very grateful
and very generous
he will make sure that you are clothed fed and sent to the very best school
you will have everything you want
but if you dont give it to him he will be very unhappy
and you see what happens when he is not happy yes
cat nods yes
so why dont you just give that little thing which belongs to him
will you do that
cat hesitates for a moment and then removes one hand from underneath the table her fist closed tight
marco smiles kindly
he holds out his hand
you are a smart girl
marco opens his hand
and in this life smart girls get everything they want
what do you want cat
and just as she is about to open her hand
under the table gripping the handle of the knife taped there
just tell me sweetheart
what do you want
in a flash the knife is whipped out and buried into marcos unsuspecting open palm
driven with such force the knife pierces through the back of his hand and sticks into the table beneath pinning his hand
marco wants to scream but there is so much pain nothing escapes his throat
in his ear to kill don luis
the men searching look up and before they can react cat races past them
as she runs through the rooms of the house sprints to the bathroom where one foot hits the toilet springing her onto the ledge of a very small window
as she looks back she sees the gunmen in hot pursuit
and she jumps head first
barely squeezing her small frame through the tiny window
and she drops
six feet down onto a ledge that is just beneath the window
she flattens against the wall holding onto the medal of her father
one of the gunman comes to the window cannot fit through looks out does not see anybody across then hears something beneath him looks down sees the tip of a
puts his gun out the window points it down and
lets loose with a barrage from his weapon
she watches as the bullets split the cement all around her feet
coming inches from ripping into them
and then the barrage stops
his clip runs out
and as he fumbles to slam another one in
she hears the pause
looks out over the sprawl of houses that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela
she looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father gave her
pops the chip in her mouth swallows leaps over the small divide between her house and the next roof and takes off running
gets the clip to fit sees cat heading off across the roof out in the open exposed vulnerable
he lifts his gun to shoot when the gun muzzle is slammed up peppers the ceiling with bullets
the gunman turns to marco holding his bloody rag wrapped hand
we need her alive
cat leaps from one rooftop to another shinnies down a drain pipe onto another roof
jumping down from the window of cats home start to sprint across the roof in hot pursuit
she drops down to another roof this one filled with a vegetable patch where an old man is gardening
marco exits cats house wrapping his bloody hand tightly with a piece of his shirt
he orders four more gunmen who have just zoomed up on motorcycles
the souped up rice rockets take off in four different directions
as she comes off the last rooftop down into a small alley
she sprints across to a small door
she kicks at the door which gives way and enters
where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap
they look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood splattered school uniform do not say a word
and neither does cat
she just runs through to a small gate on the far side of the courtyard opens it and disappears
one of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the gate hiding it
they crash through the vegetable garden
the old man deftly kicks a rake leaning against the wall
it falls in between the rows of tomato vines
when the gunmen sprint through the first one trips over the rake goes crashing through the vines which causes the two men behind him to also trip and fall
the fourth man hurdles his fallen cohorts bounds over the roof
and the fifth man looks at the old man
knows what he has done
shoots him dead before jumping off the roof
she races down a steep hill in the crowded favela streets
they enter the laundry yard
the women dont even look up
the gunmen look around just see laundry hanging from the fence do not see the hidden door
race back out
she runs down a steep alley filled with people sitting outside their homes chatting playing dominoes
at the end of the alley two motorcycles appear
the riders see cat as she sees them
they turn their bikes into the alley
and bear down on cat
cat sprints back up the hill
she goes to escape into one of the open doors but she finds that one after another the doors have closed shut the people fled inside
the bikes eat up the hill
cats legs are no match for them
it seems she will be caught any second
she ducks down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal pipe running the length of the alley
as cat ducks through the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her tear through the sheets
she looks back to the dead gunmen disappears over the hill
marco in an open top jeep with three of his gunmen on board comes rolling up the road
he sees cat
the jeep screeches around
cat dashes down an alley
as she runs up the alley with its open sewers running on either side
the alley is too narrow for the jeep
the men spill out spring up the alley
she runs up the alley then ducks down another one
she comes to a ladder that leads up a fence begins to climb
running up the alley turning into the next one
where they see the ladder
one of the gunmen pulls out his cell phone
in the jeep scouting as it rolls along
she is running for all she is worth out of breath scared
more thugs on bikes on foot in cars
they are everywhere
she is leaning against a wall on a rooftop gulping air when she hears the roar of engines
looks over the side of the building to see dozens of gunmen flooding the area
climbing the ladder
hearing them coming
surrounding a building
throwing grappling hooks onto the roof ledge
seeing the grappling hooks claw onto the roof edge
cresting the roof from the ladder
rappelling up the side of the building on the grappling ropes
flooding onto the roof from both sides
coming to the spot where cat was only moments before
to find no cat
one of the gunmen takes out his cell
on the phone
were cutting off the southern streets
marco slams his phone shut
heads for his car
the gunmen clear the roof
as the last one leaves he takes one last suspicious sweep of the roof cannot figure where this wisp of a girl went to
his eyes briefly focus on the chimney
he clambers over the side of the roof
cat holding her breath listening keenly to the sound of the men departing is wedged into the chimney her hands and feet clinging like a lizard to the walls on
cat comes over the top of a hill the soot of the chimney mingled with the blood of her parents staining her dress
the doors and windows all along the street are shuttered tight
her eyes search the curb as she makes her way down the street
when she hears the sound of a vehicle
she looks up to a jeep turning the corner
in the windshield of the jeep staring at her
we got her
close the net
she sees marco
she pauses for a moment and then does something that stuns even marco
she starts to run right towards the jeep
a bit stunned
what is she doing
she keeps sprinting toward the jeep
another jeep appears over the hill behind her
starts to come at her
as his jeep speeds right for her
as she runs her eyes go to the right and it becomes apparent she knows exactly what she is doing
she has a plan
and she executes it
suddenly she leaps for the curb and
sees cat dive to the curb
as she wriggles her skinny little body down the grate with barely enough room to squeeze in
but in she does squeeze
in total disbelief watching her disappear down the narrow slit in the curb
both jeeps pull up
the men jump out
marco flattens to the street peers into the grate sees cat staring up at him
marco takes his gun out
jams it in the grate
empties his clip into the dark
when he runs out of ammo he peers down again
cat is gone
the gunmen run to the next sewer grate fire into that one
marco looks down no cat
get down there
the gunmen rip the grate out jump down the hole
the gunmen following the beams of their flashlights go tramping through the muck of the sewers trying to find cat
the only living things they find are rats scurrying across their feet
we lost her
he kicks every car in the street in frustration
the gunmen wait in the sewer waiting
come back out
the gunmen retreat back the way they came
they do not see someone watching them go
a small crevice in the sewer wall
cat has squeezed herself into the crack almost invisible
cars and trucks rumble along a busy thoroughfare
a hand emerges
and then cat pulls herself out into the street
she stands at the edge of the busy thoroughfare and looks around
she is in the heart of the city
where tall office buildings compete with graceful classical mansions
in the distance she sees the hillsides covered with the twinkling lights of the favelas two miles and a world away
two marines stand guard
looking straight ahead
the marine looks down to cat
bedraggled covered in soot and blood and shit
holding out the card her father gave her
the american looks at the card cat gave to the marine hands it to another american
and you say you have something for us
he turns to cat who nods yes
may i see it
cat takes a beat
puts her fingers down her throat
and throws up all over the mans desk
cat reaches into the goop on the desk and comes up with the chip
she hands it over to the man behind the desk who takes a handkerchief out and takes it from her gingerly
he looks at the chip looks at cat
facts figures names dates a wealth of information scrolls down
we have to record this
cat does not understand
the second american hits a button on a remote
where did you get this
and where is your papa
did he tell you what this is
cat watches out the window as the planes landing gear drops and the city of miami spreads out before her in all its shimmer and glistening glory
we are making our final approach to miami international airport
please fasten your seat belts
she looks down at the medal around her neck
a tear forms in her eye
rolls down her cheek
impossible to tell if it is a tear of joy or sadness
cat with a plastic envelope holding her travel documents around her neck accompanied by an airline rep walks down the jetway toward the entrance to the airport where a man
looking directly at her
all the passengers are filing to the left as they leave the jetway but as cat and her escort approach the man
come with me
he walks to the right
cat stands in front of a rotund bureaucrat with the man who escorted her handing over her passport
shes the one
she is indeed
the bureaucrat looks at her passport
as cat glimpses through the slatted window looking out over the customs floor where all the other passengers are being processed in long lines
you must have done something pretty important to get the royal treatment little lady
cat says nothing
he stamps her passport
welcome to america
cat looks at him not sure if this is good news or bad news
cat looks out the window of the car at the skyline passing by silent filled with wonder
you like music
cat looks at him doesnt respond
he turns the radio on
a god awful c w song comes on
cat looks at him for a moment then reaches over turns the radio off
goes back to looking out the window
the car passes a gate with a sign miss porters school for its been our mission statement since we first opened our doors in nineteen twenty three
to provide a safe healthy nurturing environment where young women can get the education they will need to meet the challenges of that amazing adventure called life
how does that sound to you my dear
cat does not respond she just stares out the window
its been a long day for her
heres the check for the years tuition
he hands over a check
and the five hundred dollars allowance for the first six months
he hands over a wad of bills
which we keep right here
she places the money in an envelope with cats name on it and puts the envelope into a drawer
and give you twenty a week for incidentals
she hands a twenty to cat
who takes it without saying a word
what do we say darling
where do i sleep
three dozen girls of all ages go about their business
some do homework on their beds others do their hair dance run around
and suddenly at the sound of a door opening they all stop and look in the same direction at cat and the monitor girls this is your new classmate
please welcome her and show her the ropes
wake up is at seven
all the girls stare at cat
no one makes a move
in the silence you can hear a pin drop until
the biggest girl in the dorm a head taller than everyone and twenty pounds heavier with bully written all over her face saunters down the aisle right towards cat
her name is
and you are
the girls all around twitter
sherri looks back at them no good rising on her smirking face
well very tired im sure you want to lay down and rest your little head
theres your bed
she points halfway down the aisle to an empty bed
cat is about to walk towards it when sherri puts a beefy hand in her chest
but its gonna cost you
cat looks at sherri
looks at the other girls all hanging on every word waiting to see what jumps off
cat considers then reaches into her jumper and extracts the twenty dollars the headmisstress gave her
hands it over to sherri
peace has its price yknow what im saying
cat says nothing just stares at sherri
are we clear on that
twenty dollars a week
sherri opens her sweatshirt to reveal a fanny pack
she unzips it puts cats twenty in with a wad of other twenties
we got a smart one
the other girls hoot and whistle
sherri removes her hand from cats chest
you can go now
cat still says nothing
she walks up the aisle past all the other girls who remain silent
it is only after cat has laid down on her bed that the laughing and twittering resumes
cat stares at the ceiling her hand reaches inside her jumper takes out the medal her father gave her
she holds it close in her hand just lays that way
all the girls are asleep in their beds
silence reigns except for the small cries and sighs of girls asleep
her eyes still open her hand clutching her fathers medal
she gets up
cat makes her way down the hall
at the end of the hall is a door marked exit
but she is not looking at the exit she is looking for something else
and she finds it
a door marked headmistress
cat tries the door it is locked
she takes her fathers medal from around her neck and uses it to pop the lock
looking left and right to make sure the coast is clear she enters
cat tries the drawer where the headmistress locked her money away
she looks around takes a letter opener off the desk pops the drawer extracts the envelope with her name on it
again cat walks down the darkened hall looking for another door
finds it marked infirmary
cat walks along the cabinets containing the pharmaceuticals until she finds what she is looking for
she smashes the glass door reaches in extracts one bottle
cat with four belts slung over her shoulder the bottle from the infirmary in one in one hand a cloth in the other stands over the sleeping sherri
cat pours the contents of the bottle out into the cloth
seals the bottle
puts it down
then takes the cloth and places it over sherris sleeping face ever so gently
the sun comes up over the horizon casts its first rays through the windows of
the sun hits the faces of the girls
as they wake they find two very interesting things
a twenty dollar bill on each bed
sherri fast asleep her hands and feet tied to the post of the bed with belts her shirt pulled up her money belt gone
and the word thief written in magic marker across her stomach
and the drawing of the cataleya orchid
a kind faced hispanic woman a
hola chica where are we wanting to go today
cat barely up to the window hands the ticket agent the piece of paper her father gave her
the woman looks at the paper
chicago is not next door you know
cat holds up the envelope from the headmistresses office
the landscape of america passes by through the window of a bus
clutching a new lara croft comic nibbling on a big mac and fries out of a bag cat sees
the sugar cane harvests in the florida wetlands
two big fat black women sitting on the porch of a shack shelling peas in the deep south
the steel mills of pittsburgh fire up
the endless expanse of corn and wheat stretching from horizon to horizon across ohio
the giant milk barns of indiana with their hundreds of cows
and finally sees the great city of chicago looming in the distance as the bus hurls down the highway towards it
as seedy as any bus terminal
people bustling people hustling
a veritable cauldron of humanity bubbling with the good the bad the ugly
the predators and the prey
cat exits into this stew of life looks around checks things out
as she is checked out in turn by some pretty sleazy types
cat ignores the eyes following her walks up to a dwarf hawking newspapers
hands him her slip of paper
he points her in a direction
cat walks across the neighborhoods of chicago
sees the signs in polish change into signs in italian in spanish chinese ethiopian
she hands her paper to an ethiopian cabbie
he points her onward
she walks past bars where black gangbangers watch her pass
she hands one her paper he points her on
she walks past massive churches synagogues mosques
she walks past the stately houses of the gold coast along the deserted stretches of the glam shops on michigan avenue over the bridges
until she comes to
the denizens of this world look every bit as dangerous as they are
gangbangers con artists trouble waiting to happen at every turn
cat walking down the block as the eyes of everyone she passes follow her
she stops on a street corner
opposite her a group of men hanging outside a bar see her
the leader of the group calls her over
you know what time it is
cat shakes her head
its late and this is not the kind of place a kid should be hanging out
what are you doing here
cat hands him her paper
he looks at her suspicious
who are you
the man takes a moment
he disappears up a small alley into the darkness beyond
cat not knowing what to do sits down on the curb watches street life
hookers soliciting men in passing cars
cops sitting in a patrol car bored blase
men playing craps against a wall
some very discreet dope deals more sleight of hand than anything else
a very bloodied face
once twice three times
emilio restrepo a hard case fuck with me at your own risk written all over his face is about to deliver another crushing blow to a poor soul strapped to
a chair when
the beating stops emilio turns
theres a girl looking for you
im not interested in a girl right now
he turns back to the task at hand
cocks his fist
its not that sort of thing
again emilio stops
the man hands her cats paper
says her names cataleya
this focuses emilios attention
cat is sitting watching the street when a pair of legs appear in front of her
cat looks up to the man who disappeared
come with me
he turns abruptly heads back up the alley
cat follows the man through a darkened alley
at intervals on either side dangerous looking men armed to the teeth stand in the shadows
the man opens a door beckons cat to enter
cat follows the man as he moves down a long hallway
cat looks into the rooms on either side of the hall as she walks along
in one room opening out to a trucking bay tv sets are being unloaded into a big warehouse full of stolen merchandise
in another room guns are being serviced
lots of guns hand guns assault rifles
cats attention is drawn away from the room with the guns to the man holding a door open for her at the very end of the hall
cat enters an office with three women working on computers
looks like any other business office
at the sight of cat the women get up and exit closing the door behind them
cat is left alone
she looks around the office when the sound of a door opening behind her
she turns to emilio
who approaches her cautiously scrutinizing her
now it is cat who hesitates
emilio covers his mouth seems rocked
i thought you were dead
he crosses himself
i thought you were all
cat stands stock still
emilio takes her up in his arms lifts her crushes her to his chest
cat remains suspended emotionless for a moment
and then for the first time emotion real emotion washes across her face
her lower lip begins to tremble
tears well up in her eyes
she bursts into tears
youre safe now
all the emotion the fear the anger that she has kept locked away deep inside rushes to the surface in one massive wave
the sun peeks over the horizon spreading the fog infused light coming off lake michigan across the sleeping city as it ascends in the sky
one beam of sunlight slips through the narrow crack between a window and the shade covering it
the ray of sunlight washes across cats sleeping face
she wakes slowly
her eyes open after a long sleep
for a moment she does not remember where she is
cat looks around the clean orderly bedroom as she gathers her thoughts
her eyes move around the room
it is a boys room
with models of soldiers futuristic warriors a big poster of al pacino as tony montana in scarface
a poster with every imaginable type of assault rifle
emilio sits reading the financial section of the morning paper over what seems to be the remains of a very hearty breakfast
an elderly woman grandmotherly fills his coffee cup
a noise turns both of them to the doorway and cat
buenos diaz cara
ill make you some eggs
mama caresses her face her eyes glisten with a grandmothers love
kisses her on the forehead lovingly whispers into her ear
you have your mothers beautiful eyes
dont be scared
this is your home
slowly hesitantly cat makes her way across the kitchen to the table where she sits opposite emilio tentative
when was the last time you slept
i dont know
a long time ago
a growing body needs sleep
when i was your age i would sleep half the day
i dont know if it helped with the growing but i was well rested for whatever came after
whose room is that
where is he
his voice holds anger not sadness
no one who is still alive
mama comes over puts a plate of eggs in front of her
as she begins to wolf down the food
he holds up the page of her drawing the one her father put his address on
you are very talented
is this what you want to be
i used to want to be like lara
a super agent
shoveling more food into her mouth
chewing cat shakes her head
matter of fact i want to be a killer
she keeps shoveling food in her mouth
emilio looks up at his mother who crosses herself
cat finishes the last mouthful looks up
can you help
emilio blinks once
emilio walks cat down the street
he is carrying a kids book bag
the good news is your father bought you your life with what he gave you
the bad news is don luis was playing both sides and has disappeared
you tore down everything he spent years building up with that little chip
it is something he will not forget
there is a law in this thing of ours
if someone does you the revenge goes all the way down the line
women children grandmothers dogs cats
are you trying to scare me
i am trying to educate you
the principal watches emilio count the money out
normally we dont accept students in the middle of the academic year but under the circumstances losing her parents in that tragic car accident
cat looks out the window saying nothing
he hands a list over to cat
who keeps looking out the window
these are the school supplies youll need
emilio takes them
shes still in a bit of shock
see you monday cataleya
such a pretty name
she keeps looking out the window
as emilio walks along with cataleya reading the list of supplies
well get all this stuff then go over to this little place i know down on maxwell street for some of these hot dogs the polish people make here
he turns left at the cross street
you like hot dogs
he looks down sees no cat
looks back to see cat walking in the opposite direction
cat keeps going
he hurries catches up with her
where you going
ive already been to school
i told you what i want to be
you dont want to help me fine
ill do it myself
she walks off
emilio grabs her
any idiot can be a killer
emilio draws a
magnum pistol from his shoulder holster and empties the entire clip into the front of a car coming down the street
the car careens off the road smashes a fire hydrant crashes through a plate glass window of a shop across the street
the water from the hydrant shoot twenty feet in the air
emilio holsters his gun
you want me to teach you to be a killer
ill teach you
but youll be dead in five years
if you want to be a killer and survive you have to be a smart one
you have to know things besides how to pull a trigger
you have to know how the world works
how people think
you got to learn to be psychological
that i cannot teach you unless you learn the basics at school
cat glares at him
now whats it going to be
he holds out the gun in one hand and the schoolbag in the other
cat hesitates for a moment
takes the schoolbag from emilio
then takes his hand and they walk off together as police sirens announce the arrival of cruisers and people pour out of the school and the surrounding stores
as they put distance between the chaos and themselves
but i still want to be a killer
a sleepy california town on the way to nowhere
a police cruiser sits on a quiet street right off a wider avenue
there is no traffic either way
the nose of the cop car juts out just off the street
two cops are sitting peeling back the wrappers on their burgers
so then i suggest yknow we buy some things to spice it up a bit
as they nibble and talk they pay scant attention to a set of headlights coming up the broad avenue
a garter belt some of those stockings that come up the thigh
its fourteen years
know what i mean
the lights come closer
no matter how much you like steak sometime a lamb chop is not a bad thing
the lights shine right into the car
only then when the lights are directly on them do the cops turn to see a car heading right toward their front end
the front end of the cop car gets sheared right off by the impact
glass shatters metal crunches airbags explode
the other car
the drivers door opens
a vodka bottle falls out clinks to the sidewalk
and a moment later two legs emerge from the car
two very long very shapely legs
legs that never end
in very high heels and a very short mini skirt
and the face on top of it framed by a mane of wild hair is drop dead think you have died and gone to heaven gorgeous
the whole package reads supermodel
and by the way she is weaving when she stands and the bottle at her feet the read is very drunk supermodel
who looks at the crumpled police cruiser looks into the windshield of the cruiser at the stunned cops and says in the most sweetly drunk voice
the cops cant believe this
they regain their wits and bolt out of the car
thats all you have to say
and ever so sensually she starts to laugh
the cops look at each other perplexed
and she keeps laughing
the cops get pissed
and she keeps laughing
wanna laugh you crazy bitch
ill give you something to laugh about
and even when they slam her to the hood of the car jam her hands behind her back and slap the cuffs on she keeps laughing and laughing
a quiet night in the small station
cat stands in front of the booking desk so drunk the two cops have to hold her up
a surveillance camera over the desk innocuously records everything
cat keeps her head down her face obscured by her mane of hair
as the sergeant goes through her purse finds
no license no registration
no id except a library card
he reads off the library card
valarie phillips in addition to all that
youre being charged here with dui destruction of police property driving the wrong way on a two way street
is that it
unless you can think of anything else you should be charged with
wearing no panties
the sergeant and the arresting cops holding her up give her a long look as do any of the other cops in ear shot whose eyes go to her very
thats not a crime
and she teeters over passes out cold right on the sergeants desk
take her in the back lock her up put a cup of coffee in with her
let her sleep it off well book her tomorrow
the two cops who booked her drag her out
as they do the sergeant and the two other cops on duty lean over to try and get a look up her very long legs and her very short skirt
three black suvs with blacked out windows come rolling up to the station
the doors open and a dozen u
marshals jump out
vigilant forming a cordon around one of the vehicles out of which comes a hand cuffed kevlar wearing hard as nails mafia type
the marshals surround him guns bristling on the look out for any danger and hustle him towards the doors of the police station
the station doors slam open
marshals barge in
the head marshal approaches the surprised sergeant on the desk flashes his credentials
us marshal warren
we have gennaro rizzo here on an overnight
the mafia guy
on the way to testify up in san francisco tomorrow
they didnt notify you
hold on a second
he rifles through some papers
here we go
says here youre not expected until tomorrow
never expect the expected sergeant
to his men secure this place
the marshals come down the cell block checking everything out
they pass cat in her cell passed out cold her long legs and short skirt slows their progress a bit
after a long look they move on
rizzo is pushed into a cell
the door is slammed and locked
one man here
two more outside the front door
everyone else on the perimeter in teams of two
he hands out thermos bottles
its a caffeine kinda night fellas
a lone cop passes cats cell doing the nightly rounds
as soon as he is gone
cats eyes snap open
she sits up moves with the efficiency and determination of someone who has not has a drop of alcohol
she takes a spoon from the coffee cup left for her reaches into her mane of hair and extracts a small pin
she inserts the pin into the keyhole of the door jiggles it
the door pops open
cat exits the cell takes a broom leaning in the corner and keeping her eye on the camera above the door she slides along the wall until she is just
under the camera
she uses the broom handle to tilt the camera up just a bit
one lone cop sits in front of the various monitors
he does not notice that one tilts slightly up points toward a blank wall
cat under the camera unlocks the second door slips out
cat comes into the hall where several vending machines lean against the wall
on the far side is a door marked electrical
she is about to head for it when she hears a door open at the far end of the hall
at the far end of the hall
a cop comes in looks down the hall
where cat was standing he sees only the vending machines
he heads right for the machines
puts coins in the machine waits for his food
where cat is pressed hard against the flat surface inches from the cop
the sandwich falls the cop retrieves it moves off exits down the hall
cat waits until she hears the door shut on the far end of the wall
she crosses quickly to the door across the way enters
revealing the electrical control panel for the station
cat stands on a narrow shelf undoes the last screws on a vent in the ceiling with a screwdriver from the tool board on one wall
cat drops down opens the electrical control panel on the wall studies it for a moment finds the switch she is looking for then turns to the wall of tools
plucks some wire a cutter a spring
cat sets to work on a jury rigged mechanism with the items at hand
when she is finished she tugs at the waist band of her mini skirt and little by little she stretches a thin dun colored leotard suit over her whole body
she takes a small plastic vial fills it with some water from the tap and sets it just so above the device she has constructed
the device is hooked to the switch she selected a small weight hangs from the bottom of it by a wire
she sets the water container just so over the spoon from her cell
the water begins to drip a drop at a time
she closes the panel door sets her digital watch
hoists herself up to the vent in the ceiling and is gone
water dripping into the spoon a drop at a time
once inside the grate cat takes one of the buttons off her blouse and presses the top of it
the button becomes a pin light which she clasps between her teeth starts to crawl on her stomach pulling herself along by her elbows and her wriggling hips and knees
the light still between her teeth
as she moves through the maze of ducts
on the way she peers through the grates in each ceiling down into one cell after another catching various views of inmates asleep as she passes over them
until she comes to a ventilation fan blocking the way
the fan blades go round and round
cat looks at her watch looks at the fan
and cats jury rigged device
the water has almost filled the spoon one more drop one more drop
the digital counter goes from to to to
the last drop of water drips into the spoon the spoon tips tugging on the wire the wire trips the switch it is connected to the whole device comes apart
the separate pieces fall to the floor
the fan stops
the blades slow
the sergeant at the desk hears the ventilation system go off
he calls to one of the other cops on duty
go take a look at the breaker on the ventilation system will ya
doyle moves off
cat watches the blades of the vent fan slow
when they have completely stopped she starts to move herself through the very narrow space between the now stilled blades feet first
doyle enters the room opens the electrical panel
the spoon the weight the spring and the wire fall to the floor
doyle looks at them curiously for a moment
cat is half way through the fan blades
doyle looks at the switches going down the printed list on the door trying to locate the right one
cat is almost through
doyle finds the switch that corresponds to the ventilation system
cats neck passes through the fan blades
doyle hits the switch for the ventilation system
cat is just through when the blades start moving brush against her forehead as she makes it to the other side with no time and no room to spare
cat comes to a vent looks down begins to loosen the vent screws
cat drops down into a bathroom
looks at her watch
sits down waiting
rizzo is asleep in his cell
the marshal on duty finishes his coffee
looks at rizzo
then walks over to the door at the end of the wall
he hits a buzzer on the wall
the cop manning the bank of monitors wakes up sees the marshal in the monitor
the monitor hits a button
the door buzzes open
the marshal passes through
the marshal pushes the bathroom door open
the marshal finishes peeing zips himself up
right into a devastating reverse wheel kick
the cop on duty hears a buzz looks up to the bank of monitors and sees the marshal standing at the door
thinking nothing of it he hits the buzzer
cat propping the unconscious marshal up hides behind him
as the door buzzes she maneuvers the body around pushes through
on the other side she drops the body and takes his gun
on the monitor it looks like the marshal is passing through
rizzo is half asleep when the barrel of a gun taps him on the head
he opens his eyes slowly to
unbutton your shirt
rizzo looks over to where the marshal is passed out cold on the floor
he does as he is told
who the hell are you
not room service
she pumps four bullets into his head
the four shots reverberate throughout the station
two patrols of two marshals each hear the shots
the monitor wakes up
cops and marshals guns drawn come running
the knocked out marshal comes to
finds a gun in his hand
doesnt get it until he looks over to see rizzo with his face blown off
the door flies open and the marshals and cops come pouring through to find the marshal with the gun in his hand and the dead rizzo
the marshal is frozen totally confused
drop it joe
tension beyond the moon
i didnt do it
the marshal drops his gun
on the floor
call a bus
cat looks through the vent over the cell
sees the wobbly confused marshal with the gun in his hand hears feet coming fast
cat comes climbing out of a ventilation duct onto the roof
she looks out over the side of the building
marshals stationed outside are running into the building
cat takes off running
the cops are cuffing the marshal
i didnt do it
ambulance on the way
another marshal is checking rizzo
search the place
cat is running as fast as she can
cops and marshals are running through every room checking everywhere
cat reaches another air vent so about to pry it off when she hears
cops running up the stairs headed for a door above them
cat hears the door begin to open
she bangs her high heels together
and two blades come out of the front
she sees the door knob turning
she runs for the roofs edge
the cops burst through the door to
the cops pour onto the roof looking around guns drawn
clinging to the wall like a gekko
the dun colored wall blending with her dun colored suit
how is she doing this
the blades fitted into the seam between the bricks
her fingertips clinging to the small lip on the bottom of the roofs edge
the cops look around the roof
she holds there listening to the noise above
hears noise below looks down to see
cops searching the alley below
hanging to the edge of the building
the cops finding nothing head back out the door
a moment later
cats hand reaches up
when one hand has a firm grasp on the roof ledge she lets go with the other hand and grasps the ledge extracts the blades from the brick seams and
swings herself up on the roof
as her shoes dislodge some mortar comes loose and falls below
the crumbling mortar falls on the head of one cop he looks down sees the crumbly gravel looks up sees nothing
cat lands on the roof lays still
he examines the gravel looks up again
and then moves on
cat pries the vent cover off slips in
cops are checking every cell in the mens block
cat is crawling along as fast as she can
the cops come to the entrance of the womans cell block
cat comes to the vent in the hallway
the cops open the door to the womens cell block
begins to pull at her leotard
the cops look at the womens cells heading right toward cats
as they reach cats the same cop who did the rounds at the beginning of the night looks into her cell
cat is laying on her side away from them dead asleep in the same position she was when the cop first checked on her
the cops pause for a moment then move on
her eyes are wide open
she listens for the outer door closing and then she breathes out relieved
an ambulance pulls up along with the marshal contingent in their suvs
the marshals spill out of the suvs as a gurney with a corpse is wheeled into the morgue
as the marshals stand around the police coroner begins to unbutton the shirt of rizzo the corpse
what the fuck
on rizzos chest the word traitor is written in thick black letters
and above them a drawing of the cataleya orchid
the marshals knows what this is
the door of a small jet opens and marcus ross a keen eyed no nonsense all business fbi agent followed by a team of similarly focused men and women exits
down the stairs to
where is he
at the hospital
reporters are gathered trying to gain access
the police are keeping them out
over the clamor of reporters outside cat is just finishing with her finger printing wipes off as much of the ink as she can
the sergeant hands over her library card
i shouldnt drink
no you shouldnt
im so so sorry
tell it to the judge at your hearing in ten days
whats going on out there
alluding to all the commotion she sees through the window looking out into the main room
fill out the forms and you can go
we need to get things organized
but dont worry the judge will send you back for sure
i probably deserve it
he hands her a sheaf of papers and a pen
as the pen hits the paper
ross with his team standing off his shoulder looks down at the stomach
lets see the location
cat hands the paper work over to the sergeant
youre lucky no one was hurt
i would have never forgiven myself
keeping her back to the security camera overhead cat collects her things and exits
as the door closes
ross exits the suv to the crowd of reporters
is it rizzo
was it an assassination
are there any clues
is it true a marshal did it
ross sees cops coming and going from the station
he turns to the marshal with him
you didnt lock it down
it was after the fact
i didnt think
ross cannot believe what he is hearing
no one in or out
exiting the station
ross and his team sweep past her
no one in or out
cat just keeps walking right past ross who heads into the station as the cops try to keep the reporters at bay
walking away from the pandemonium she is leaving behind
as it recedes over her shoulder she picks at her fingers where the fingerprinting ink has stained them
her prints come off
she drops the fake prints down a sewer and keeps walking
ross scrutinizes rizzos cell as his team takes prints photos sweeps the cell for evidence
i want to see paper on everyone in and out of the station in the last twenty four hours
he looks up to the end of the hall
and i want the tapes from the security cameras
cat extracts a knapsack from the locker heads for the womans bathroom
cat tugs at her hair
the wild mane comes off to reveal her straight hair which she pulls back in a pony tail
she begins to strip out of her mini skirt
cat dressed in jeans a scuffed leather jacket a baseball cap with the brim pulled low over her eyes with her pony tail sticking out of the back the knap
sack on her shoulder waits on line to board the bus
she keeps her back to the security camera has her phone to her ear
a number is ringing
emilio fifteen years older is watching a soccer game picks up the phone
in the kitchen mama is cooking
are we good
cat moves up the line to board the bus
when are you back
i have something
the morning after ok
cant wait to see you cara
say hello to mama
he looks over to mama at the stove who waves over her shoulder
mama says hello back
he hangs up goes back to his game
cat boards the bus
the doors close behind her
as the camera zooms up and the bus pulls out onto the road
ross is pointing up at the camera cat tilted
he tilted the camera just enough so the angle would catch the guard not who was holding him
he turns to his team
twenty two murders in four years all with the same m
the word the flower
hes sending a message for sure
and im beginning to think its not to us
but were the only ones with the information
and were not getting anywhere with it are we
no one on the team can dispute this
it occurs to ross
if the message is not for us lets make sure the one its intended for gets it
i want you to put it out to the press
splash it across every newspaper every magazine
i want eyeballs on it coast to coast
lets see if anything comes back
a lincoln town car comes down the leafy quiet street of well kept homes
stops at a gate guarded by two men who wave him through
the car ends up in front of a very impressive house which sits at the end of a long driveway
toward the era of the walled property a garage and a guest house
richard in a suit and tie looking like a proper mid level government official or a lawyer exits newspaper in hand
as he approaches the front door richard looks over to see two more guards off to the side
he nods to them knows them
they nod back
richard approaches the front door knocks
while he is waiting he looks down at the paper
the door opens
richard looks up to a fifteen year older marco
been a long time
yes it has marco
hows the hand
marco holds up his scarred hand
only hurts when its humid
shouldve let us relocate you to arizona instead of new orleans
the boss likes it humid
there it is then
hes waiting for you
the door closes
don luis stares out a bay window drink in hand
don luis turns
i brought you the morning paper
he holds the paper up
ive seen it
twenty two times
a flower that only grows in one place on earth
that used to be the calling card of
what was his name
your former partner
the one who did your wet work
fabio maria restrepo
but i dont understand
why come here with this
because when we find the end of a string we like to know where it begins
now we are talking about string
im not a tailor
lets cut to the chase here ok
when the agency extracted your ass from colombia fifteen years ago and set you up here we let you resume your business when what we should have done was lock
you up for life
in exchange you were supposed to keep the information flowing
and i have
not much and not for a very long time
and this is what you traveled all the way down here to tell me
what i traveled all the way down here to tell you is theres a limit to our patience
the cia is not an amusement park
there are no free rides
everyone pays their way
and you my friend have not
what would you want
he slaps the newspaper down with the picture of rizzo
i had nothing to do with this
then find out who does
as he goes to leave
and don luis dont play the innocent with us
it wont sit well with my bosses if we find out you had anything to do with this
have a good day
richard walks to his car observed by
shes talking to us
it could be anyone
don luis reaches out fast as a cobra grabbing marco by the lapel pulling him close
i told you
down to the dog
you screwed up the first time
now go fix it
before she finds us
cat steps off the bus
looks around to
the total full on crush of people that a major metropolitan bus terminal holds
she sees a surveillance camera tucked in a corner
she pulls the brim of her hat low over her eyes takes off into the crowd
cat comes to a non descript high rise
cat enters a completely bare bones dwelling there is nothing that identifies the person who lives here
white bare walls a table with one chair a single bed
along one wall a cabinet
on the window sill a single cataleya orchid
cat waters the orchid
cat opens the cabinet to three computer screens
two of them are divided into quarters and show various views of the building entrance the lobby the stairway the elevator the hallway
the third screen is dark until cat hits a button and music fills the apartment
music with a heavy sensual back beat
ooh la la
and the screen pulses and glows in time to the beat
cats body responds to the music moving sexy her shoulders rolling her hips swaying
cat sashays across the open space a stripper strutting her stuff shedding first her blouse then her jeans her lingerie until by the time she reaches a free standing opaque
cylinder of a shower with an opaque shower curtain she is completely nude
she enters the shower
turns on the water
like a snake shedding a skin she lets the water divest her of everything that came before
since each and every one of the victims was a professional bad apple
weve narrowed motive down to payback or preemptive
ross has just pinned up rizzos picture on a wall filled with twenty two other deceased all with words and a cataleya orchid imprint on their stomachs
he turns to face his team
he points to rizzo on the wall
the most recent was done to keep him from talking
points to a gorgeous dead woman with the word grifter on her stomach
made a career of getting intimate with big stakes gamblers out of vegas and then taking them off and sending them to meet their maker
points to a huge black man with usurper written in white letters across his chest
tried to take over the heroin trade in houston from
he points to two mexicans identical twins one with pay written on his chest the other with the word back
the gemini cartel
their crimes are self explanatory if you can read
now i know some of you are thinking whoever is doing this makes less work for mother
and since theres no collateral damage why are we wasting valuable manpower and resources on the case
and since until now there has never been a clue to go on why go on
but with this last killing
he holds up a stack of folders from his desk
we have one
as we go to the video tape
he hits a button and the video replay of cat walking the unconscious guard through the door
we cant see the assassin but we can see
he freezes the tape
points to the time mark on the tape
which means our perp was in the station at
i dont have to spell it out for you
he begins to hand the folders out
these are the names phone numbers and addresses of everyone with a pulse who entered that police station before two am
cops criminals clerks janitors
one of them is our target
i want each of you to locate the ten people in the folder youve been given
i want a complete dossier on every one of them for the last ten years of their lives
run down every lead
check out every story
our killer is out there
and were going to find him
before he kills again
as an elevator train rumbles by below
an elevator train rumbles by above
a car parking
and danny delaney preoccupied a pleasant easy going good looker at closes the door and walks to the entrance of his low slung apartment building
danny puts his key in the door finds that it is unlocked
he pauses then enters
danny enters his darkened apartment
goes to turn on the switch
dannys hand freezes
he stands very still
take off your shirt
do i have to
and then a match is struck a candle is lit
standing before him in garters thigh highs a very sexy bra and fuck me pumps is
cat closes to an inch of him
you should have called
i could have been out
i have a key
i could have been late
she begins to kiss him lightly around the mouth
ive got nowhere to go
she keeps kissing him lightly on the neck
you show up whenever you want to
and then we have the most incredible sex
im just saying
he fumbles for the words
wouldnt you like to go to dinner sometime
she keeps nibbling
this taste good enough
or a movie
they put me to sleep
so lets pop in a dvd and you can spend the night here
looks him in the eye
would you like the key back
i just want to get
i dont know
she resumes nibbling on his neck
she runs her nails down his chest slowly teasing
her hand finds his groin
what she finds makes her smile
is this close enough
she gently lowers his hands to his sides holds them there
kisses him deeply
pushes him down onto the floor
and lowers herself on top of him
a small moan escapes his lips as she takes him inside her
his face holds the smile of the memory of the night before
he turns his head lazily
the pillow beside him is empty
cat is gone
dannys smile fades
emilio walks down the stairs carrying a shopping bag
track with him along the street
until he comes to a laundromat
emilio loads laundry from the shopping bag into a machine puts in the coins then sits down on a bench to watch the cycle
seems to talk to himself
and then we see he is talking to
on my end
what do we have
emilio takes a manila envelope out of the bag
places it on the seat next to him
cat picks it up looks through it
you remember the guy who was in the news for running that ponzi scheme about a year ago
the cover features william woogard the most unassuming baldheaded pudgy faced man a nerd
under the headline he disappeared fifty billion dollars
the money was never recovered
skipped out and bought himself citizenship on some shit hole of a caribbean island that calls itself a country with no extradition laws
lot of very pissed off people lost everything
cat goes to get up
theres something else
he slaps the newspaper down with rizzos picture on the front page
how long has this been going on
the paper says twenty two
all like this
tell me why
since youre a kid you dont do anything for no reason
dont play dumb it insults me
ive got to get ready
as she goes to rise emilio grabs her hand
its not just you in this
its me mama
you book the work you collect the fees
i watch your ass
each and every job i vet i double vet
for every one i book you i turn down five ten
i promised to keep you safe
i keep you safe
its a full time job no matter what you think
they freaked me out
i didnt realize
i come to you at nine
i say i want to be a killer
what kind of kid makes a career choice like that unless they have something on their mind
i live for the day that the blood of the son of bitch who did my parents drips in the gutter
stop playing the innocent with me
you know this
but the way youre playing it
they even have a name for you
the tag killer
i would have stopped it a long time ago
had i known about this
because i love you
a smile that could melt ice in winter
but a knowing smile
a dont bullshit a bullshitter smile
if you do you would never have let me get involved in the first place
the truth of her words deprive him of his
she kisses him him on the forehead
i love you too
and she exits leaving emilio more concerned
he looks down at the picture
ross is at his computer staring at the screen and the orchid alongside a map of colombia and the specific region where the cataleya is found
data comes up
and what he sees stuns him
a folder marked cia confidental
a ramshackle warehouse its windows streaked opaque with years of dust and grime surrounded by a fence and a weedy garden which is home to dozens of the most unique
wind chimes of all sizes and shapes made from scrap metal
and two of the biggest most ferocious dogs on earth laying on their sides asleep
the dogs ears perk up hearing something we dont a low growl begins to rumble deep in their throats
the gate to the garden begins to open and like a shot the dogs are up hurling themselves toward the opening gate eyes flashing barking loud enough to scare the
dead back to life fangs bared ready to kill
and then they stop cold when they see who it is coming into their domain
holding two very full shopping bags
and the dogs jump all over her licking her
she pets them plays with them
the dogs obey her in a heartbeat sitting expectantly
not making a sound
now lets see what good boys you can be
she reaches into one of the shopping bags pulls out two roasts
top cut sirloin
which she puts down on the ground
the dogs eyes go to the chunks of meat
the dogs can barely contain themselves
red juicy delicious
the dogs whimper in anticipation
she picks up the shopping bags and heads for the ramshackle warehouse
the dogs moan but do not move their eyes going from the meat to cat
cat reaches the door
sees the dogs looking at her
the dogs pounce
each one grabs a roast and tears into the meat with ferocious pent up glee
cat smiles at the sight enters the warehouse
the warehouse is filled with piles of rusting scrap metal the cannibalized carcasses of cars trucks shipping containers welding equipment hammers tongs all sorts of tools
in the corner is one fully built truck a big red monster with huge demolition fenders
this is home to old pepe an ancient blind man who is working away building yet another set of oversized chimes out of scrap metal
i guess the boys gave me away
the barking would only have stopped when their screaming began
you spoil them
i train them
if thats what you want to call it
cat kisses pepe taps one of the chimes it makes the most ethereal sound as one chime bangs against the other
she opens a cupboard in the makeshift kitchen area and starts unpacking the groceries
did you get the beans i like
and the salsa verde
and the salsa verde
not the one in the short bottle
the long one
i hate that other one the chili they use sucks
did you see your uncle
she moves from the kitchen walks across to the far wall
were going to church for easter
not this year
until she reaches a big discarded safe taller than her with an impregnable door
you should you know
i should do a lot of things
she turns the combination knob
you could start with that one
it would make us very happy
maybe next year
the door opens reveals shelves with dozens of passports stacks of cash
no one knows what happens tomorrow next year is a long time away
how was your trip
cat starts to remove some of the cash
starts to count it
stick it in her pocket
she takes a passport out
your ears are better than my eyes
you work too much
i keep telling that to emilio
the girl should have a life while she is still young enough to enjoy it
you should take a vacation
go some place warm
with a nice beach
she slams the big safe door shut
from the air surrounded by the bluest of waters
bestowed with the greenest of verdant foliage
surrounded by exquisite beaches
a spray of water fills the screen
an exquisite villa surrounded by a high wall
as the girls clamber out of the pool ignoring the four armed body guards patrolling poolside they are met by three maids holding robes for them to slip into
i pay to see more not less
the robes disappear
willie you are such a perv
as william slips into a robe held open for him he grabs the asses of two of the girls
lunch is served
giggling the girls scamper toward the villa where a sumptuous table is set on the veranda attended by more servants
william is handed a drink as he sips it watches their perfect barely covered butts his eyes pools of desire the servant holds out an envelope
for you sir
perplexed william takes his eyes off the girls and regards the envelope
no return address no stamps
he opens it and his perplexed look goes to one of concern
someone is looking for you
a where did this come from
it was in the post box this morning
william cannot fathom what this is all about
but he does not like it
over hot dance hall music the sun sets magnificently into the shimmering sea
the music blasts throughout the villa
there are several bodyguards stationed all around
two of the girls dance erotically for william who reclines on an oversized couch smoking from a hookah
the third girl is out in the foyer laying on the glass floor which is the top of a large aquarium where dozens of sharks swim back and forth
here fishy fishy
she taps on the floor the sharks ignore her
theyre ignoring me
william comes over
put a drop of blood in there and theyll be your biggest admirers
all the way down to your stripped clean bones
and speaking of stripped
he lifts her up like a piece of luggage
as she squeals with delight
the other girls come running
the party moves up the winding staircase
the bodyguards look at each other roll their eyes
william is at the double doors to his massive bedroom suite the girls are on the bed in the bg jumping around in the skimpiest bra and panty sets having
a pillow fight
to head of security bring extra security in for the night
and make sure were shut down tight
have a good night sir
i intend to
the doors close and lock
wild shrieks come from inside
a van rolls up to the main gate half a dozen security men exit
there are already guys in the garden and guys out back
i want you three upstairs two on the roof
you three downstairs
as they all enter the villa the camera lingers on the van
a figure dressed in black rolls out from under the carriage as it pulls away and disappears into the bushes
two guards stand outside the bedroom door
two guards are on the stairs
three guards in the salon
three more in the garden outside
the head of security goes around the villa checking that all the doors and windows are secure
his men are posted outside the door to the bedroom on the stairs in the salon
he closes lights as he goes
he walks across the aquarium floor in the foyer to the front door closes the lights so that only the glow from the aquarium lights illuminate the dark
and he exits closing the door behind him turning the lock
the sharks gliding back and forth
and then a figure in a black wet suit fins and a mask with a small back back comes gliding into through the sharks
who just go about their business
the figure stops at the edge of the glass floor takes something out of the back pack and very skillfully cuts a small hole in one of the glass panels
that makes up the floor
the diver lifts out of the aquarium pulls back the wet suit
it is cat
cat opens the backpack removes a silencer fitted pistol
cat enters silent closes the door approaches the bed where william is asleep sandwiched between the three passed out girls
empty champagne bottles and glasses are strewn about
cat stares down at the scene points her gun at william
one of the girls rolls over onto william ruining her shot
as sits up suddenly startled from sleep
no one is in the room
he looks around and notices the bedroom door ajar
he is more awake now sees the nymphettes sleeping soundly
he rises dressed in a silk sleeping robe
he feels something on his chest goes over to the mirror opens his gown and sees painted on his chest in red lipstick the word thief and a drawing of
a cataleya orchid
panic starts to set in
william tip toes to the ajar door
he peeks out and sees two guards with bullets through their foreheads blood leaked out across the white marble floor
really panicked he flattens himself against the inside of the door his breath coming in gasps
william holding the two guns of the dead guards in front of him makes his way down stairs past two more dead guards
growing more and more nervous by the moment he tries a light switch on the wall nothing
the only light comes from the ambient glow of the aquarium below
he reaches the bottom of the stairs
he crosses the aquarium floor and when he is right in the middle
stop right there
cat comes out of the dark
in her hand a silencer fitted pistol
who are you
doesnt matter who i am
he pulls the trigger on his gun
click click click
he tries the other one
again click click click
what do you want
i want you exactly where you are
and then without warning she puts a bullet in both his knees
he falls to the floor
the blood starts to seep out onto the glass
the sharks swim back and forth
whatever they paid you ill double it
you know the thing about sharks
you can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers
ill give you anything you want
dont kill me
im not going to kill you
she fires three shots into the glass square he is kneeling on
the glass shatters
william falls into the water
grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself up
his blood runs down into the clear water
cat turns and walks toward the door
he struggles frantically to pull himself out
and then the sharks hit
he is violently dragged under
the front page of a newspaper with a picture of the remains of william under the headline sharks eat shark
the newspaper drops to reveal richard at his desk
i cant believe this
he drops the paper is about to leave his office when the phone on his desk rings
who is this
fbi special agent jack ross
im lead agent on a case
a serial killer we call the tag killer
hiding his anger
ive seen the publicity
marks his victims with a flower
a cataleya orchid
when i try to access information i get stuck with a cia access denied folder
i understand you were the station chief down there when this rash of murders with the same mo
listen agent ross we dont give out any type of information over the phone
so what i suggest is you file a formal request with the agency for any information you might want
and ill be more than happy to get back to you as soon as i can
he hangs up
looking at his phone and the dial tone emittting from the handset
a plane lands
we think cat is getting off the plane
it is marco and two of his thugs
as he is crossing the terminal he passes a newspaper machine
the headline of the paper in the window catches his eye sharks eat shark
as he stares at the picture of the dead william his phone rings
a pissed off richard is on the phone
no more bullshitting me marco
ive got the fbi on my ass now
i want that problem taken care of
do you hear me
loud and clear
the newspaper picture of william being pinned to a board
ross turns from pinning up the picture alongside the other twenty two to his team
where are we
we idd everyone who came in and out of the police station for the twenty four hours preceding the incident
the only one that we could not verify was a
picked up for drunk driving four hours before the hit on rizzo
are you sure
its our only lead
lets see her booking report
well there was a little problem
seems she was too drunk to get a photo
but not to get prints
we ran the prints in the data base
no match was found
so if there is no booking record how did we get the name
a library card
the only id she had was a library card
i dont believe this
there are the surveillance tapes
from three angles
well lets see them
the two agents look at each other even more chagrined
one of them pushes a button on the computer
and the three angles come up
one has a shot of cats face covered by her hair one has a shot of her face covered by her hand and the third one has an angle of
its not a lot to go on
but put them in the data base and lets see what matches
the agents exit
ross looks at the pictures on the board
cannot believe it
marco and his thugs enter a small social club bar
a dimly lit place where strangers are few and suspicious looks from the rough men playing pool at the back to able and lining the bar are par for the
eduardo a small time hood lines up a shot with a pool cue when a hand comes down on the ball he is about to shoot
he looks up to
hello eduardo que pasa
i have fifty bucks on this shot
thats whats que pasa
he opens his arms
eduardo is friendly but there is a hesitation a tension in the air
as they break marco takes a roll of cash out
he goes to hand it to eduardo
first for fucking up your shot
second for an address
you remember fabio
the cataleya killer
its a long time
you went to school with his brother in law
what was his name
like i said
now the men at the bar are starting to take notice
i have a problem
and we think fabios kid is behind it
eduardo takes the roll of bills and puts it in marcos shirt pocket
i gotta be honest with you
everyone knows you guys were playing a double game and when the shit went down you were the only ones who got out of it clean
the men at the bar are now edging closer
one of them has a shot gun resting along his leg inconspicuous and conspicuous at the same time
so you do have a memory
now get the fuck out and let me take my shot
marco looks at eduardo who glares at him
eduardo goes to line up his shot
the tension in the room is thicker by the moment
as eduardo is about to hit the ball marco grabs his hair and slams his forehead into the cue ball
at the same moment marcos two thugs whip out their guns and blast away
the shotgun wielding man raises his gun and as he is killed by marco his blast takes out one of marcos thugs
in an instant it is over
everyone is dead except marco one of his thugs and the dazed eduardo
marco notices his ear is bleeding touches it it pisses him off that blood has soiled his white shirt
pissed marco yanks eduardo up from the floor and slams him onto the pool table
sticks his gun in his face
you dont tell me what i want to know by the count of three you scum sucking lowlife prick your memory will be permanently disabled
a buzzer sounds
danny opens the door to his building
danny enters to a candle lit room and
i brought you something
she is in a very sexy lingerie top
her hands are behind her back

she takes her hands out from behind her back presents him with a cute little stuffed alligator

cat hesitates standing there half dressed feelings that she never wants to deal with coming to the surface
im lonely sometimes
isnt that enough
its a good start
he smiles puts the stuffed animal aside
now we can have sex
cat smiles caught a bit off guard by his sweetness
he approaches her she goes to touch him
he puts her hands down gently
let me this time
and for the first time she lets him touch her first
lets him kiss her lips her neck and as he goes south kissing as he goes the camera holds on her face and for the first time she allows herself
to receive to give herself over to being the seduced rather than the seducer
and she likes it
the city wakes
turning over expecting to find no one there
surprise this time
because there is someone there sleeping peacefully her face half covered by her hair bathed in the soft light of dawn
danny smiles so pleased
danny puts the finishing touches on a breakfast tray
he looks at the stuffed animal she brought him
it warms his heart
danny stands with the breakfast tray looking at cat sleeping
he cannot quite believe it
he puts the tray down takes his iphone points it at her goes to take a picture
she wakes with a start
to find danny standing there with a breakfast tray and a big smile on his face
cat is disoriented
i didnt know if you like your eggs over easy or scrambled so i made
cat jumps out of bed starts to dress quickly
i shouldnt have done this
pulls on her jeans
any of it
can we talk about it
pulls on her top
we already talked
slips into her shoes
does not answer
i made breakfast
i dont like eggs
as she heads for the door she turns
now you know something else about me
and with a small smile she is gone
outside dannys door cat crosses to the elevator waits for it to come
as she does she fixes her clothes a bit her eyes on dannys door
dont come out
the door doesnt open
the elevator arrives
she takes a deep breath enters
the door closes
cat comes running in
cat hurries down the aisle keeping an eye on the security camera
making sure she stays on the far side out of its range
she stops in the middle of the aisle starts to examine paint brushes
sorry im late
standing next to her looking at a color chart hidden from the security camera as is she
he is pissed
he has the newspaper with woogards picture
he throws the paper in her face
cat is taken aback by a display of anger she has never seen in this man before
you said you would stop the writing
then he shoves an article cut from a paper in her face
as she starts
seven people slaughtered in a miami bar
i knew one of them
years ago in school
i dont like it
this is getting too close
could be anyone

he hands her an envelope
maybe this will help you understand what i am telling you
emilio leaves first this time
cat just stands there her world rocked
she opens the envelope takes out a photograph looks at it
dressed for her first communion
everyone is smiling
she is holding a cataleya orchid bouquet
her eyes well up
she cant hold it anymore
she begins to cry
brown eyes hazel really dark hair thick shiny
danny is sitting with his friend ryan

he hits the button
cats picture appears on the screen with the message begin download
cats picture gets turned into millions of pixels which start combining and recombining into faces that look like her dont look like her looking for a match
ross is staring at his cataleya orchid looking over his reports frustrated when his computer screen lights up the the following message data match and alongside the half assed pictures
of cat from the security tapes in the police station the picture from dannys iphone starts to form
ross picks up the phone
i want a trace put on an incoming transmission
ross continues watching his screen data match probability
a map comes up on his screen immediately
a grid map of the city with a focus finder bringing the search area closer and closer
until the area is identified one police plaza
emilio mama and pepe are sitting in a pew during easter mass
someone comes up from behind sits down next to them
they turn to cat
who smiles like a child
emilio smiles back
mama takes cats hand kisses it
they all sit and listen to the mass like all the other families around them
as everyone is exiting
you will come home for lunch
one thing at a time
she kisses them and walks off
that was such a nice surprise
i knew it would happen
everyone grows up
i think shes going to be ok
i think so
as their car pulls into the driveway of the house
from down the street
watching emilio mama and pepe enter the house
and three thugs
on a larger computer screen the various pictures of cat none of them conclusive
as ross and his team look on
we need a common base so lets try size
he punches his keyboard
the computer screen shuffles the pictures until they all match up one on top of the other
and on the screen size confirmation match good
now lets see
he focuses in on the hands on the pictures from the security tape and the ones from dannys iphone picture
the images start moving matching
and when they are coordinated on the screen hand confirmation match
he types in nose match
again the pictures shuffle line up
nose confirmation match nice nose
thats your girl
in the shower
the water pelting her face
cat outside the shower
cat in a bra and panties walks across to the kitchen pours a drink
downs half of it then refills the glass
cat sits by the living room window
takes the last drop of the drink
as she looks out on the night sky she lights a cigarette
feeling so alone
she takes one drag on the cigarette stubs it out
she takes the picture of herself and her parents looks at it sighs deeply
a tear forms
her loneliness her sense of isolation grows
for the first time she seems a bit lost
danny sits by his window also feeling a bit lost and also so lonely
he stares at the picture of cat on his phone
when the phone rings
dannys heart goes to his throat
oh my god
i cant believe it
rosss computer bings
dannys name and number come up with the message call active
ross looks up

ross and his team are listening to the call on an intercom
on the screen a tracer is looking for the location of the call
in my apartment

she opens her cabinet to the four screens
i didnt mean to offend you
cat attaches a device to her computer
does not respond
its just you looked so cute
i can erase it if you want
its not even a good picture
cat is not listening she is looking at a message flashing across the screen

on her surveillance screens cat sees fbi swat pulling up to the building
cat hangs up rushes into the bathroom turns the shower on full blast
hurrying out on her screens she sees the swat swarming into the building
cat opens a cabinet
on the back of the door are a dozen keys
she chooses one
she checks the screens one more time sees the swat rushing the stairs the elevators
she turns off her screens
and runs out of the apartment in her t shirt and panties
the swat are running up the stairs
the swat led by ross are watching the elevator numbers climb
cat reaches the stairs just as the elevator is reaching her floor
she ducks down the stairs as the elevator door opens and ross and his team step out guns raised exercising extreme caution keeping very quiet
cat takes the stairs two at a time
the swat comes running up the stairs two at a time
swat listens at cats door
ross is at the end of the corridor
whispers on mic shower
ross signals for a scope
swat takes a flex cam and begins to slide it under the door
cat comes to a door uses her key to open it
she enters to
a guy eating his lunch in front of the tv
he reaches out to grab her
cat grabs his hand and slams his face into his tray of food knocking him cold
ross watches the screen as the flex cam shows the interior of cats apartment
cat pulls down a camouflaged hinged door in the ceiling
on it is a harness with several things attached guns charges thick metal clips
she slips into the harness
rosss team goes from apartment to apartment
on the video cam ross is seeing nothing in cats apartment
he points to one of the swat signals for him to set charges against the door
the man begins to do so
cat is setting charges in a rectangular pattern on the rear bathtub wall
the agents at an apartment door
no maam everything is under control
we just need you to stay inside
may we have a look around
as the fbi enters
cat has finished setting her charges
she looks up at the ceiling listens
rosss man has finished setting the charges
he looks at ross
the rest of the team fingers their weapons
cat waits looking up
an fbi agent knocks on the door of the apartment she has just entered
ross give the go ahead nod
the swat hits his detonator
at the same moment that his charges explode
cat hits hers
cats door blows open the swat flood in
a perfect rectangle is blown in the wall revealing utility pipes
ross and his crew swarm all over the place
find the shower empty
cat has attached the hooks from the harness to the pipes
ross barks into his walkie talkie
shes not here
lock the building down
cat lets go
ross is looking at the bank of security monitors in cats cabinet sees all his men all over the place inside the building outside
where the hell did she go
cat lands on the floor next to door
she unhooks herself from the pipes and pushes out the door
enters through to the
cat looks around listens and then begins to make her way across the garage using the parked cars as cover from the security cameras
ross leads his men as they scour the building
no one in or out
lock this place down
cat reaches an open space where cars just cannot shield her
there are two security cameras covering it
cat draws one of her silencers and shoots the lens out of one camera
an agent is standing next to the building security guard when one camera goes out
one security camera down
cat shoots the second camera
heads across the open space quickly
the second one is down
into walkie talkie all units
converge on the garage
cover every exit
cat has reaches a vent which she removes having loosened the screws before
the swat and rosss team flood the garage
vehicles screeching in men running in full body armor guns ready
cat is just climbing into the space behind it
pull back to the swat all over the place
look under every car
in every trunk
cat hurries along a tunnel comes to a utility door and enters
cat enters a room full of lockers
she starts opening them until she finds what she is looking for
a maintenance uniform
cat walks along in coveralls boots and a hard hat passing several crews of workers welding hammering doing repairs
she disappears into the gloaming
a normal day
kids playing ball
trashmen picking up trash
cat enters the house
cat walks through the house like it could be a trap a silencer in her hand
her senses are keening she is that alert
and then she finds the first body
a bullet in her head
cat has all she can do to keep it together
then she finds pepe a bullet in his head
it is almost too much for her to bear
and then she finds emilio tied to a chair tortured
this is too much for her to bear
cat cuts emilios beaten and bloodied body loose and gently takes him in her arms
and begins to cry
an operator answers
federal bureau of investigation
how may i direct your call
cat is on a pay phone
id like to speak to the agent in charge of the tag killings
ross is pinning up the pictures of cat on his board
his phone rings
cat hangs up the phone
the building is emptying out
in the lobby ross passes a floor cleaner and a lone security guard
ross picks up a prepackaged meal
ross enters his building
ross enters turns on the lights revealing an apartment as austere as cats
heads for the small kitchen where he is about to put his precooked meal in the microwave
when he feels a gun in the back of his neck
this wont take long
ross raises his hands
cat reaches around removes his gun
ross faces her
she motions him into the chair behind him
just so you know all this
being so smart
covering all your bases
its not going to matter
its already over
the whole place is wired with web cams
his moment of triumph is short lived
cat reaches on the side of the counter
holds up six web cams wires ripped out
you mean these
tosses the ripped out cams onto the table
talking about covering all your bases
your chair is pressure wired
you move your ass one inch you dont have one anymore
ross looks under the chair
sure enough there are several wires leading out of the bottom of the chair
he looks further to the where the wires attach to a small charge
she puts her gun down on the table
i know what youre thinking
maybe yes a bluff maybe no
but you have to figure yes given what you know about me
ross does not move
this wasnt what i had in mind for myself when i was a kid
i wanted to be on the other side of things
so what happened
she takes out an old picture of don luis lifted from the internet
she takes out the picture of her parents and her as an eight year old
this is the last time i was happy
the next day they were dead
he killed them
and all this
all these clues
they werent for us
they were for him
i didnt know how else to find him
and you figured sooner or later we would make this public
it took you a long time
youre very patient
what else do i have to be
i have no one
until this morning
i had them
she takes out pictures of dead mama dead emilio dead pepe
you sent him a message
he sent you one back
and now i want to finish it
i cant help you
yes you can
hes protected by your government
by a part of the government i have no way of reaching
i dont know why
but theres no getting through it under it around it believe me ive tried
youre going to have to try harder
she takes a photo album out opens it
i found this on your table inside
your family right
begins to flip pages
brothers sisters nieces nephews
ross knows what is coming
i know this sounds harsh
but until i get what i want youll go to a funeral a week
and you will begin to feel what i have felt all these years
she places the photo album in his lap
puts his food in the microwave starts it
goes to exit
he points to the chair
when your dinners ready the timer on it will have expired
then you can get to work
and she is gone
ross watches the timer on the microwave
when it beeps he sits a moment longer
hesitates to get up
little by little he moves himself off the chair tentative
afraid that any moment boom
until he makes the final move stands just enough to clear the seat waiting for the worst to happen
and when it doesnt he breathes a sigh of relief
a non descript building
facing a large picture window
you understand i only agreed to this meeting out of professional courtesy
the president wanting us to reach out to you folks on the domestic side and all that pie in the sky crap
the truth is i really cant help you at all
cant or wont
same thing really
look lets put all our cards on the table here
ive met this woman
she trapped me
she told me if i did not get her this man
he puts luiss picture on the desk
she will kill a member of my family every day until i have none
then he begins to laugh
youre kidding me
do i look like i could make something like that up
richard says nothing
what should i do now
id go to the police
now if youll excuse me i have a meeting
he goes to rise when rosss phone rings
richard sits back down
she says you either give her what she wants or she is going to redecorate your office
ross points to richards chest where a red laser beam holds on his heart
what does she think this is
tell her that glass is tempered to resist a direct hit by a fifty seven millimeter ordinance
all of the sudden a bullet shatters the window destroying a picture of richard standing with the president hanging on the wall just behind his head
the red dot is back on richard in a heartbeat
she says shes using seven point six two steel jacketed armor piercing shells
and you have ten seconds to give her the address
richard starts to come unglued
how can i be sure once she has the address she wont kill me anyway
but i can assure you that if you dont give her the address you will be number twenty four on her hit parade
trust me on this one
after an interminable moment
eight seven six magnolia terrace
there is a long pause on the other end of the phone
she asked you to keep this conversation strictly confidential
a moment later the red dot disappears from richards chest
richard breathes out
ross reaches out shakes richards limp hand
because honestly i didnt know how i was going to explain you splattered all over your walls
richard looks at the shattered picture
the presidents head is intact
the bullet has ripped richards face clean off
close on a big steel door opening revealing an armory of weapons from pistols to rpgs
cat loads weapons and ammo into pepes big red truck
the last thing she takes a laws rocket launcher
the dogs sit there watching her
you guys ever been to new orleans
off the dogs puzzled faces
the red truck smashes through the doors of pepes warehouse
the truck heads off down the road disappearing into the night
cat drives through the night just watching the road
the dogs sit behind her also watching the road
she passes a sign new orleans miles
smith a courtly old architect opens his door and enters his building
smith enters to find
sitting with two cups of coffee and pastries
i didnt know if you took sugar and cream so i got one of each
who are you
you designed the house at eight seven six magnolia
you either leave immediately young lady or i am going to call the police
cat pulls a gun
i would love to see the plans of this house
you will take up positions here
as don luis sips a cognac staring out the big bay window onto the wide street beyond the garden
the house sits prominent in the middle of a quiet neighborhood
marco points to the floor plan explaining to the dozen thugs gathered with their weapons
you must expect the unexpected
she is like mist under a door like a mouse in the wall
she will never attack straight on
you will not see her until it is too late
she is that invisible
on don luis as he sips his cognac
he sees a big red truck approaching in the distance up the road
as he watches squinting curious the truck does an abrupt u turn
marco drones on in the background
we would prefer she be taken alive
but with a bitch like this if you get a kill shot you take it
don luis watches as a woman gets out of the truck
he cannot make out who it is what with the fog and his vision
he sees the woman open the rear door of the truck and pull something out
he takes his glasses out of his pocket puts them on
just in time to see
seeing the rocket heading right for the salon
they all leap out of the way just as the rocket comes crashing through the bay window
and blows the salon to smithereens
cat reenters the truck drives off fast
as the debris falls and the dust and smoke rises marco helps don luis up
he is a little stunned
through the gaping hole where the bay window was they see the red truck driving off
get the armored mercedes
we have to get don luis out of here
the four run off
everyone to their positions
as they all run out
the four thugs run into the garage where there are several cars
and a big armored van
but just as they open the doors to the big mercedes
cat leaps out of the truck and before the four startled thugs know what has hit them she puts three of them down with shots to the heart
the fourth runs out the back
the fourth thug runs for all he is worth bleeding from his forehead panicked
calmly exiting the garage she removes a set of throwing knives from a belt around her waist taking a long minute to gauge the distance
when he has almost reached the safety of the house
he drops like dead lead the two knives embedded in his back
inside the house seeing cat through a window
looking back at him
pointing a finger at him
before she disappears in to the drifting mists
you hide here
he opens a secret door in the wall revealing a small space
barely big enough for a man
wait for my call
either she is dead or we have her far enough away so you can make it to the garage
take the van
the armor is so thick nothing short of an atomic bomb can penetrate it
thats the first time you ever said that
dont get used to it
don luis shuts the door
off the door slamming
another door opens but this one is
on the side of the mansion and leads into the foundation
cat crawls in and pulls the door shut
marco and the men are walking through the mansion guns at the ready when they come to a long stretch of hallway
marco signals them to stop
he listens carefully
signals for one of the men to move down the hall
as marco and the other men wait the first thug makes his way down the hall looking left and right opening doors
as the man walks along above the floor creaks dust drops down in a fine cloud
as the man progresses and the dust gets closer and closer
turns to marco to signal everything is ok
just as he signals he is riddled from below with dozens of bullets
the man dances like a puppet on a string before falling to the floor dead
marco takes a grenade out flings it
marco and the thugs dive for cover
the grenade blows a big hole in the floor
as soon as the smoke and the debris stop falling
the thugs hesitate
marco points his gun at them
hesitant the thugs approach the hole
pointing their weapons they unload a barrage of bullets
one of them peers over the side
a single shot pieces his eye
the thugs and marco run
the thugs set up two big ass caliber machine guns at the two openings in the foundation
the thugs manning the guns let loose blasting away
smoke and flashes from the muzzles mingle with the fog
don luis hears the firing which thunders through his closet
the thugs fire until their ammo is spent
as the sound dies away silence reigns
don luis hears the silence
he speed dials on his phone
marcos phone rings
he motions for one of his men to look into the dark hope
hesitant the man peeks around the side
i think we got her
don luis lets out a sigh of relief
did you see the body
marco urges his man to look deeper expose himself more to look in the hole
marco watches as the man does so very cautiously
still no movement
he moves full body into the opening to peer in
is blown back by three fast shots
stay where you are
and then he starts screaming into the hole careful to stand just off to the side
you know what bitch
i loved killing your father
he was a coward
and you know what else
i screwed your mother behind your fathers back
we all did
she couldnt get enough of it
i killed her
i killed him
you want to avenge them
the whore and the coward
thats what you come from
come get the bullet with your name on it bitch
and then a whistle from above
marco looks up to see cat standing on a second floor balcony with two pistols
marco starts to fire his men raise their guns
in the blink of an eye with bullets flying wildly all around her cat blows five of the seven thugs surrounding marco away
marco and the remaining two thugs run toward the guest house
out of the range of her guns
don luis is panicking
yelling into the phone
marco and the two thugs run into the small house
you two here
that door opens
he points to the door they just came through
kill anything that comes through
marco runs into the bedroom
marco runs to the curtained windows rips the curtains back hoping to escape
and finds that the windows have metal hurricane shutters on them
marco pulls out a set of keys frantically tries fitting the keys to the locks
none of them work
he runs for the door again
just as he has his hand on the knob two shots ring out
he checks his gun realizes he is out of ammo
he knows his time has come
he drops is gun backs away from the door
backs right up to the bed and sits down
his phone rings
what the hells going on
marco just stares at the door
there is a small sound outside the door
i will hold here
the door shatters as cat kicks her way in
marco pulls his trigger
marco is frozen
just stares at cat
waiting for what is going to come
do it you bitch
isnt this the moment youve been waiting for
yes it is
she empties her gun into him
gripped by fear don luis runs for all he is worth across the fog shrouded garden until he reaches the garage
he yanks open the door runs inside
don luis runs around pepes red truck and the crumbled mercedes jumps in the armored van
don luis fumbles with the keys grinds the ignition in his desperation
the engine turns over
don luis slams the transmission into gear but bangs into the crumbled mercedes blocking his way
he slams the gearshift into reverse bashes into the wall behind him and then jerks the gear shift into drive ramming the mercedes with a little more room
back and forth back and forth don luis rams at the mercedes until he has made enough room to turn the van bang past the mercedes and smash his way
out of the garage
the van comes roaring out of the garage tearing up the gardens jumping on the driveway and speeding off to the main road
cat comes running from the opposite direction two guns blazing
as bullets ping off the van don luis regains some of his confidence
a small smile breaks across his face as he looks in his rear view mirror and sees cat running and firing losing ground
cat reaches the end of the driveway fires her last shots runs out of bullets
stands watching the van head off down the road
don luis watches her run out of ammo standing in the road receding
i beat you bitch
you cant kill me
i am unkillable
cat stands in the road watching the van
she takes out marcos cellphone
cat scrolls the phone book
she highlights van
presses don luis is at a red light so pleased with himself
humming a tune
when the van phone rings
surprised he looks at the call coming in
he presses the speaker
i dont understand you
you should have been dead a long time ago
you got lucky
you were given a second chance at a life
why did you not take it
why did you involve yourself with this insanity
for something you can never understand
the love i had for my parents
and you killed that
and because of that you have ruined your whole life to try to kill me
you stupid bitch
dont you get it
someone like me
i cannot be killed
i do the killing
not the other way around
and now it is your turn to be hunted
you will never find me
but as day follows night believe me i will find you
and i will kill you
and you know why
because i will never be where you can kill me
i will never be where you want me to be
actually don luis
you are exactly where i want you to be
don luis doesnt get it
and then he hears a low growling behind him
he turns a little sees sitting there in the dark recesses of the van two enormous dogs
his eyes register confusion then apprehension
cat hears the growl over the phone
a small smile breaks across her face
and then se speaks into the phone one last time
over the sounds of the dogs tearing don luis to pieces and his horrible screams the van shakes as if it were caught in an earthquake
cats shoulders sag relax
her face is peaceful as it has never been before
she looks at marcos phone
i want you to think hard
danny sits opposite ross
was there anything else
i already told you everything
she would come over wed have amazing sex and she would leave
its really late and im really tired if youre not going to arrest me
we dont really have anything to charge you with
then can i go
just a few more questions
can i have a cup of coffee
ross gets up and leaves the room
danny is feeling really shitty
he takes his phone out of his pocket looks at cats picture
and then it rings
im so sorry
i didnt mean
are you ok
she says it without the slightest bit of sarcasm
where are you
i didnt tell them anything
that i would come over and we would have amazing sex
your phone is tapped you know that
you have forty seconds before they pick up on this
gives you the time for three questions
whats your real name
danny looks at the orchid on rosss desk
sees the name tag
like the flower
now cat smiles
how did he know that
will i ever see you again
i know where to find you
ross is drawing coffee
were picking something up off that kids phone
ross drops the coffee hurries back to the office
if there is ever a chance
i want you to know
i could love you
if you let me
i love you
cat holds on that one for a moment
then the beeping of a phone connection cut
danny closes his eyes
ross bursts into the office
grabs the phone from his hands
cat in jeans t shirt a baseball cap with her pony tail sticking out the back exits a phone booth she boards a waiting bus
the doors close
the bus drives off down an endless road
