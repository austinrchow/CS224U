ed wood by scott alexander larry karaszewski by scott alexander larry karaszewski directed by tim burton november we move through a spooky shrouded parlor as a storm rages outside
thunder roars and lightning flashes in the giant windows
in the center of the room lies an oak coffin
suddenly the lid starts to creak open
a hand crawls past the edge
and then the lid slams up
famed psychic criswell pops out
criswell peers at us intently his gleaming eyes framed under his striking pale blonde hair
he intones with absolute conviction greetings my friend
you are interested in the unknown the mysterious the unexplainable
that is why you are here
so now for the first time we are bringing you the full story of what happened
extremely serious we are giving you all the evidence based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal
the incidents the places my friend we cannot keep this a secret any longer
can your hearts stand the shocking facts of the true story of edward d
we drift down past the dark clouds
through the torrential rain
and end up
weve landed in hollywood
were outside a teeny grungy playhouse
the cracked marquee proclaims the casual pacing nervously in the rain is ed wood our hero
larger than life charismatic confident errol flynn style handsome ed is a human magnet
hes a classically flawed optimist sweet and well intentioned yet doomed by his demons within
the doors open and eds pal john bunny breckinridge hurries out
bunny is a wealthy theatrical fop wearing a string of pearls
suddenly the rest of the cast runs up frantically upset
in a flowing white dress is dolores fuller a sharp hungry for a career ingenue
shes near tears
eddie my dove just flew out the window
she goes on in two minutes
what are we gonna do
they all look to ed awaiting a response
he thinks a second then excitedly claps his hands
dolores give me your shoes
the ghost can be barefoot
give me your shoes she hands ed her white shoes
he snatches one grabs a pair of scissors and starts cutting up the shoe
everyone is baffled
he keeps cutting the shoe
and it slowly takes on the shape of a dove
ed then grabs some pipe cleaners works them into a shape and sprints into the dressing room
he takes some green eye shadow and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners
ed then hurries back out jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut up shoe
and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth
the cast is flabbergasted
the soldiers suddenly look up
hey i think i see something
dolores floats down onto the stage holding out the dove
i offer you mortals the bird of peace so that you may change your ways and end all this destruction
ed and his gang celebrate opening night in a dirty hour diner
theyre noisily slugging down drinks in a big red booth
what a show
everyone was terrific
paul your second act monologue actually gave me chills he grins at actor aka paul marco a young eager beaver whos loyal like a dog
aw thanks eddie
actor aka conrad brooks a friendly simple minded lug runs up waving a newspaper
i got the early edition
it was just dropped off at the newsstand
he smiles at everyone this is the big moment
ed opens the paper to the entertainment page
insert the newspaper
ed turns to a column the theatrical life by victor crowley
under this is a photograph of an old man with an ascot
everybody excitedly crowds around and starts reading
and then their faces drop
clearly this is a disastrous review
their faces get sadder and sadder
and then they finish
a melancholy beat until what does that old queen know
he wasnt even there
he knocks back a drink sending a copy boy to do his dirty work
well fuck him do i really have a face like a horse
what does ostentatious mean
ed calmly waves his arms for attention
he tries to smile
hey its not that bad
you just cant concentrate on the negative
hes got some nice things to say
he scans the review see the soldier costumes are very realistic
everyone kind of stares at their drinks depressed
ed launches into an upbeat speech
hell ive seen a lot worse reviews
ive seen ones where they didnt even like the costumes
like that last francis the mule picture it got terrible notices
but it was a huge hit
lines around the block
so dont take it too seriously
were all doin great work
you really think so
its just the beginning
i promise this if we stick together one day ill make every single one of you famous
he smiles at everyone at the table
they all believe what he says and there is a hushed moment of dream filled hope
ed and dolores lie in bed in the dark
he stares vulnerably at her
honey what if im wrong
what if i just dont have it
ed it was only one review
orson welles was when he made citizen kane
ed youre still young
this is the part of your life when youre supposed to be struggling
but sometimes i get scared this is as good as its gonna get
dolores kisses ed affectionately
thingsll change for us
nobody stays on the fringe forever
she gets out of bed
we see her tiny apartment is drab and crumbling
dolores turns on the shower then walks to the closet
she looks inside
god wheres my pink sweater
i can never find my clothes anymore
he rolls over in bed away from her
cu on ed reading the hollywood reporter
a rude boss in suspenders suddenly strides up
hey big shot get off your ass
they need a potted palm over in the carl laemmle building
sure thing mr
ed jumps up
we widen revealing hes in a giant greenhouse packed with rows of potted plants and shrubs
ed grabs a small palm tree and hurries out
ed strolls across the busy movie lot lugging the palm
he passes a soundstage and notices the stage door open a crack
ed glances around then puts down the palm and hurries in
soundstage o same time a big budget foreign legion movie is shooting with a huge cast and crew
a giant desert set has been erected with camels and real sand dunes
ed is blown away
whoa look at all this sand
this is real sand
my god whered they get all this sand
a security guard sees him
this is a closed set
ed is caught
he hurries out
movie studio o day ed continues across the lot carrying his palm tree
an old crusty man sticks his head out an office window
come in here
i got some great new stuff to show you
ed puts down the plant again and runs in
editing rooms o day the old guy is proudly showing ed stock footage on a moviola
the footage is totally random giant explosions buffalos stampeding tanks an octopus swimming etc
ed is dazzled
this is fantastic
what are you gonna do with it all
eh probably file it away and never see it again
its such a waste if i had half a chance i could make an entire movie out of this stock footage
getting inspired see the story opens with these mysterious explosions
nobody knows whats causing them but its upsetting all the buffalo
so the military is called in to solve the mystery
ya forgot the octopus
no im saving that for the big underwater climax
the old guy cackles
ed finally carries the tree into the laemmle building
young secretaries in june cleaver hairdos are giggling
they say he was a girl trapped in a mans body
ill bet it hurt when they snipped his thing off
all the girls shriek in horror
ed walks in and puts down his plant
what are you ladies gabbin about
you know that christine jorgensen freak
he she its in variety
some producer is making a biopic
startled r really
i didnt see the story
ah it was buried in the back
the guys a real smallotime operator
she holds up her variety
ed hurriedly takes it
the story headline says boyotoochick flick to click
we pull out revealing were now in ed holds the newspaper while he paces around his apartment
the place has threadbare carpet faded wallpaper and an electric burner for a kitchen
a handful of mangy dogs run around
tacked up are movie posters for dracula freaks and the magnificent ambersons
dolores talks on the phone while ed silently coaches her
dolores on phone yes ive got mr
edward wood on the line
could you please hold
ed gives her a thumbs up perfect
he confidently takes the phone
ed on phone hello mr
i heard about your new project and was curious if you signed a director
oh you havent
well if we could get together i could explain why im more qualified to direct this than anyone else in town
beat uh id rather not go into it over the phone
lll see you then
ed hangs up and yelps excitedly
he kisses dolores
she pulls away
eddie i dont understand
why are you the most qualified director for the christine jorgensen story
nervous he lies aw er its just a bunch of hot air
i had to say something to get in the door
ed walks jauntily along wearing a snappy suit
he reaches a door that says screen classics o george weiss president
ed fixes his hair checks his clothes then enters
screen classics o same time its a crowded root piled with paperwork and files
film cans are stacked everywhere and framed oneosheets for test tube babies blonde pickup and girl gang litter the cracked walls
sitting behind the messy desk is georgie weiss a rug merchant turned exploitation film producer
he juggles a large sandwich and angrily barks into the phone
georgie on phone look when i said you could have the western territories i didnt mean all eleven states i meant california oregon and uh whats that one above it
well screw you
georgie slams down the phone
he smiles warmly at ed
can i help you
yes im ed wood
im here about directing the christine jorgensen picture
yeah well a couple of things have changed
it aint gonna be the christine jorgensen story no more
goddamn variety printed the story before i had the rights and now that bitch is asking for the sky
disappointed so youre not gonna make the movie
no of course im gonna make the movie
ive already preosold alabama and oklahoma
those repressed okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff
so well just make it without that she male
well fictitionalize it
georgie bites into his sandwich
ed is dazed
is there a script
but theres a poster
georgie pulls out artwork of a hermaphrodite man on the left side woman on the right
the lettering screams i changed my it opens in nine weeks in tulsa
mustering up his courage well mr
weiss im your guy
i work fast and im a deal i write and direct
and im good
i just did a play in hollywood and victor crowley praised its realism
theres five hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing
you said on the phone you had some kind of special qualifications
ed takes a measured piuse
this is his big revelation
weiss ive never told anyone what im about to tell you
but i really want this job
he gulps i like to dress in womens clothing
are you a fruit
no no not at all
i love women
wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them
so youre not a fruit
nah im all man
i even fought in beat course i was wearing ladies undergarments under my uniform
you gotta be kiddin me
confidentially i even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties
ill tell ya i wasnt scared of being killed but i was terrified of getting wounded and having the medics discover my secret
georgie sits back
its a hell of a story
and this is why you think youre the most qualified to make my movie
i know what its like to live with a secret and worry about what people are gonna think of you
my girlfriend still doesnt know why her sweaters are always stretched out
ed you seem like a nice kid but look around you
he gestures at the posters i dont hire directors with burning desires to tell their stories
i make movies like chained girls
i need someone with experience who can shoot a film in four days thatll make me a profit
beat im sorry
thats all that matters
bar o day ed sits morosely in a scuzzy bar three empty shot glasses in front of him
a bartender ambles over
are you gonna get something else
ed glumly empties his pocket
all he has is change
ed sighs and staggers out
ed shuffles down the street his head hanging low
a restaurant door opens and an eisenhower era nuclear family exits
whitebread dad mom son and daughter stride out in their starched clean clothes
they march obliviously past ed
he watches them go then continues
ed reaches a building hollywood mortuary and glances in the window
a pause then he does a doubletake
the showroom is filled with sample coffins
lying inside one is bela lugosi
he is flabbergasted
lugosi slowly sits up inside the coffin
bela is an aged year old man once a great star now a faded memory trying to hang on to his nobility
quite frail and tired he is still a master of the grand gesture
an unctuous salesman steps up
bela speaks in a thick hungarian accent which gives him an old world elegance
this is the most uncomfortable coffin i have ever been in
lugosi ive never had any complaints before
the selection is quite shoddy
you are wasting my time
mildly annoyed bela climbs out
he straightens his cloak and walks to the exit where be bumps into nervous ed
excuse me mr
irritated i told you i dont want any of your goddamn coffins
i dont work here
bela peers at ed then glances confusedly over his shoulder at the salesman
bela looks back at anxious ed
who are you
what do you want
i dont want anything
im just a really big big fan
ive seen all your movies
bela strides out
bela hurries along
ed chases after him
why were you buying a coffin
because im planning on dying soon
im embarking on another bus andotruck tour of dracula
twelve cities in ten days if thats conceivable
bela pulls out a large smelly cigar and lights it
you know i saw you perform dracula
in poughkeepsie in
eh that was a terrible production
renfield was a drunk
i thought it was great
you were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie
i waited to get your autograph but you never came outside
when i play dracula i put myself into a trance
it takes me much time to re emerge
a city bus approaches
oh theres my bus
he checks his pockets shit wheres my transfer
dont you bave a car
i refuse to drive in this country
too many madmen
the bus pulls up and the doors open
ed is worried hes about to lose his new friend
he gets an idea
ed drives anxiously
bela sits next to him filling the car with smoke from his big cigar
lugosi you must lead such an exciting life
when is your next picture coming out
i have no next picture
ah you gotta be jokin
a great man like you
ill bet you have dozens of em lined up
back in the old days yes
but now no one give two fucks for bela
bela puffs on his oversized cigar
but youre a big star
i havent worked in four years
this town it chews you up then spits you out
im just an ex bogeyman
he points make a right
ed drives past pumping oil wells and into a seedy neighborhood
they reach a tiny well manicured house
ed and bela get out
bitter they dont want the classic horror films anymore
today its all giant bugs giant spiders giant grasshoppers who would believe such nonsense
the old ones were much spookier
they had castles full moons
they were mythic they had a poetry to them
he lowers his voice and you know what else
the women prefer the traditional monsters
the women the pure horror it both repels and attracts them
because in their collective unconsciousness they have the agony of childbirth
the blood is horror
i never thought of that
take my word for it
you want to score with a young lady you take her to see dracula
belas eyes twinkle
he reaches his front door and unlocks it
squalid dark with skulls and strange voodoo objects scattered about
up front hangs a large photograph of shockingly young bela handsome and regal
ed is stunned by this dismal place but doesnt say anything
within dogs start barking crazily
ugh what a mess
beat my wife of twenty years left me last month
im not much of a housekeeper
the dogs bark louder
i will feed you
i guess i should go
perhaps we could get together again
he shakes his hand certainly
but now the children of the night are calling me
bela smiles and steps inside
the door closes
dolores is in her s kitchenette making a green jello mold
ed bursts in euphoric
sweetie you wont believe it
ive got the most incredible news
excited you got the job
confused oh uh no i didnt get the job
but something better happened
better than not getting a job
i met a movie star
somebody really big who
a horror movie star
the other one
you met basil rathbone
oh the hell with you
i met bela i thought he was dead
eds eyes pop
hes very alive
hes old and frail but hes still bela lugosi
and hes really nice
boy i cant even remember the last time he was in a picture
its a shame
hes such a rest actor and nobody uses him anymore
so did you get his autograph
ed calms down
he smiles beatifically
it wasnt like that at all
it was just the two of us and we were talkin
and he treated me like a friend
ed is back in the plant department arguing with his boss
hes a bum no hes not
do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years
the black cat
well now hes a junkie
he dont deserve to work
thats not true hes so great you hire him
defensive well uh if i could i would
the guy takes a mocking face and struts out
its halloween night
children in trick or treating costumes parade up and down the streets
through belas window we see him and ed watching television a small fuzzy screen in a huge console
on the tv one of belas old s horror films plays
belas evil character is hypnotizing somebody his eyes stare the famous stare then his hand does the famous hypnotic gesture
they are entranced
the men drink beers in silence
belas two dogs lie at his feet
the old movie suddenly stops and vampira appears on the tv screen
vampira is the sexy creature feature hostess a pale ghoul slipped into a tight black dress
she leers in front of a corny fog shrouded set
there is a pumpkin a broomstick and a sign reading happy halloween
vampira on tv ooo
he gives me the willies
the only thing scarier than him is this guy i dated last week charlie from pittsburgh
boy talk about the living dead
ed is disgruntled
i hate the way she interrupts the pictures
she doesnt show em the proper respect
glued to the tv i think shes a honey
look at those jugs
bela waves his arm and starts doing his hypnotic hand gesture at the tv
you will come under my spell
you will be my slave of love
fascinated by belas hand hey bela how do you do that
you must be double jointed and you must be hungarian
back at the tv vampira look at me
stare into my eyes
ed joins bela in this activity
the two of them wave their arms spookily at the tv
bela becomes fatigued
i am getting tired
i need to take my medicine
do you want me to get it for you
no thank you eddie
ill be alright
he gets up shuffles across the room and steps behind a curtain ed is puzzled
belas thin arm appears and draws the curtain tight
we hear mysterious clanging drawers opening and closing and then silence
ed sits waiting
behind the curtain something drops
we hear a muffled shit
ed is getting worried
but then the curtain whips open and bela bounds out grinning
hes a bundle of energy
i feel better now
the doorbell rings
kids shout trick or treat
bela jumps up gleefully
i love children
bela puts on his famous cape then gets a pair of fangs and sticks them in his mouth
little kids in lone ranger and howdy doody costumes giggle expectantly
suddenly the door flies open and standing there is count dracula
the real count dracula
the kids scream and run
every kid is gone
except one tough boy
arent you scared little boy
im going to drink your blood
ehh youre not a real vampire
you cant turn into a bat and those teeth dont frighten me
suddenly ed lurches out menacingly
well how about these teeth ed rips his teeth out of his head and thrusts them at the kid
the boy screams in terror and races away
bela is wowed
hey howd you do that
ed smiles impishly then sticks the teeth back in his mouth
i lost my pearlies in the war
ed and bela run toward us belas cape flapping in the wind
ed takes a swig from belas flask
theyre a bit tipsy
are you sure this is okay
i do it every halloween
the moonlight shines down on a rickety old cemetery
the wind blows hauntingly and tombstones gleam in the blackness
ed and bela reach the locked gates
they glance at each other then start to climb over
ed helps bela
they jump down and ed peers nervously
bela looks like a child on christmas morning
he takes another swig then starts running giddily
he disappears into the cemetery
i am dracula
bela darts happily through the graves
his cape flies behind him
i am the bat
eds eyes light up
he starts chasing after bela
belas heart is racing
he zig zags past ancient crypts
gargoyles peer down
the wind howls through the skeletal trees silhouetted against the cloudy sky
ed runs through the shadows trying to catch up
bela flaps his cape up and down
we almost think hes going to fly
ed races up then quietly stops
he eagerly watches bela practically expecting him to turn into a bat
its a magical crazed moment
i am dracula
i will live forever
bela laughs then lies down on the grass
ed slowly walks over and lies next to bela
theyre happy eyes alert on top of the world
ed peers in wonder at his new friend
ed sits across from georgie
eds very excited
so whats the big news you couldnt tell me over the phone
ed gulps excitedly
he has a spiel all planned out
weiss i was thinkin about what you said about how all your movies have to make a profit
and i realized whats the one thing that if you put in a movie itll be successful
he thinks tits
better than tits a star georgie shakes his head
eddie you must have me confused with david selznick
i dont make major motion pictures
i make crap
yeah but if you took that crap and put a star in it youd have something
crap with a star
it would be something better
something impressive the biggest moneymaker youve ever had
fine maybe youre right
but it doesnt friggin matter
i cant afford a star so i dont even know what were talking about
what if i told you you could have a star for
ed opens his valise and whips out an x glossy of bela
lugosi isnt he dead
annoyed no hes not dead
he lives in baldwin hills
i met him recently and he wants to be in our picture
sheepishly uh yeah
georgie mulls this over
why would lugosi want to be in a sex change flick
because hes my friend georgie stares carefully at ed then finally smiles
you can direct it
i want a script in three days and we start shooting a week from monday
he leaps up euphorically
he eagerly pumps georgies hand
bless you mr
i promise i wont let you down
cu on a royal typewriter
eds hands whirl across the portable typewriter frantically feeding in pages as fast as be can type
we pull out
ed sits on the bed typing
hes a blur of activity juggling a cigarette coffee and a telephone while he writes
ed on phone but bunny youre perfect for this job
youre so good at organizing
his adrenalin is pumping
ed pours some booze into his coffee
you know these people
i need all the transsexuals and transvestites you can get
he sucks on his cigarette no i dont care if theyre not actors
i want realism
i want this film to tell the truth ive waited my whole life for this shot and im not gonna blow it
theres a knock at the door
ed carries the phone on a long cord and answers it
bela hurries in smiling broadly
eddie you got a new movie for me
yeah its gonna be a great picture
youll love your character
back into the phone bunny belas here
look hit the bars work some parties and get me transvestites
i need transvestites ed hangs up and resumes typing
bela is puzzled
eddie what kind of movie is this
well its about how people have two personalities
the side they show to the world and then the secret person they hide inside
delighted oh like jekyll and hyde
ah ive always wanted to play jekyll and hyde
im looking forward to this production
ed stops typing
he pours bela a drink
ehh your parts a little different
youre like the god that looks down on all the characters and oversees everything
i dont understand
you control everyones fate
youre like the puppetmaster
getting it ah so i pull the strings
you pull the strings he suddenly gets a look pull the strings
hey thats pretty good
ed quickly starts typing again
ed and dolores sit at a card table finishing up dinner
the dogs eat scraps below them
wipe off your hands
ive got a little surprise for you
he smiles nervously i finished my script
ed anxiously pulls out a pile of pages
dolores looks in awe at the cover glen or glenda by edward d
wood jr ed im so proud
ill read it as soon as i get home
apprehensive well id really like to know what you think
why dont you go in the bedroom and take a look at it
theres an uneasy moment between them
she senses something funny
dolores takes the script and goes into the bedroom
the door closes
ed starts pacing
dolores reads the script
she finishes the last page then looks up
she is very shaken
she grabs the door and opens it
ed stands somberly in drag hes in a pantsuit heels and pink angora sweater
dolores is totally rattled
she struggles for a response
so thats where my sweaters been
ed silently nods
how long have you been doing this
since i was a kid
my mom wanted a girl so she used to dress me in girlie clothing
it just kinda became a habit
and you never told me
this is my way of telling you furious what by putting it in a fuckin script for everyone to see
what kind of sick mind would operate like that
ed is terribly hurt
dolores shakes tht script
and what about this so called barbara character
its obviously me
im so embarrassed
this is our life quiet of course it is
and thats why you should play the part
you got nerve buddy
he calmly points at the script
its a damn good role
thats not the issue she suddenly stops ugh
how can you act so casual when youre dressed like that
it takes me comfortable
oh just like in the script
ed smiles serenely
he takes her hand so what do ya say
do you wanna break up
or do you wanna do the movie with me
the hallway is filled with eager transvestites
its a very festive atmosphere and bunny tries to create some order
inside the busy office paul types and conrad cranks a mimeograph machine
its good to have a job
now i can get my phone reconnected
in a corner georgie angrily waves the script at ed
i thought this was gonna be a sex change film
defensive theres still a sex change yeah
five pages right before it ends
the rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters
i dont think hes a schmuck
and whats with this new title
my poster says i changed my sex
so change the poster
trust me youll be better off
this is a story thats gonna grab people
he goes into a pitch its about this guy
hes crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses
should he tell her
should he not tell her
george this is drama
georgie throws up his hands fine shoot whatever baloney you want
i give up
just make sure its seven reels long we are on location for eds first film
a small crew of a dozen unpacks the camera and reflectors from their cars
eds voice rises above the hubbub
excuse me could i have everyones attention
could you gather around
ive got something to say
the crew members put down their things and gather in a circle
in the middle we reveal ed in complete drag
dress nylons pumps lovely blonde wig
hes quite a sight
like an eager scoutmaster he addresses his troops
everybody were about to embark on quite a journey
four days of hard work
but when its over well have a picture thatll entertain enlighten and maybe even move millions of people
a couple grips glance at each other
now the only way were gonna achieve all this is if we stay on schedule
day one today well start easy
we have eighteen silent scenes that can be shot quickly cars parking patricks suicide me strolling as a man me strolling as a woman etc
beat after lunch well bring in the inspector and the doctor
the doctor is very important to the plot so we might have to spend time on retakes
but its worth it
scene totals for the first day is thirty four
he catches a breath day two well be a little busier veteran cameraman bill an old guy with thick glasses speaks
excuse me eddie i dont mean to interrupt
but im gettin a little worried about those clouds
he points up
everybody looks at the sky
the clouds are gray
ed nods in agreement
good thinkin well talk about days three and four later
now lets get that first shot off
its scene glenda looking in the window
ed quickly runs in his heels over to the burly make up man harry
okay do i need any touch up
im telling ya eyelashes are the way to go
irritated harry weve discussed this a million times
i dont want to look like a girl
i want to look like myself
then you look beautiful harry humorlessly powders eds nose
ed turns away and suddenly shouts into a giant megaphone
ed chucks the megaphone and runs crazily past the camera and behind a building
a pause and then ed in character as glenda calm and dignified steps out and walks down the sidewalk
ed stops at a store window
hes totally in shadow
a grip grimaces
he turns on a light ed lights up
he looks in the window admires a dress on display then silently walks out of frame
lets move on
dont you want a second take for protection
exhilarated whats to protect
it was perfect
suddenly a police car turns the corner
we dont have a permit
everyone grabs equipment and takes off
the company is now shooting inside a dinky soundstage
there are dirty mattresses tacked on the walls
they prep belas set a fishnet draped armchair in front of a flat
ed is perched high in his directors chair back in mens clothes
the set doesnt look right
it looks too
clutter it up
put a skeleton in the corner
and whats that thing over there
i dont know
well it looks good
lets use it
georgie hurriedly strides over
he holds the script
whats with these revised pages
a scene in a smelting factory
a buffalo stampede
three hundred soldiers storming anzio beach whats going on here
i cant afford to film this nonsense
were not gonna film any of it
then hows it gonna get in the picture i know a guy in universals stock house hes giving me the footage for free
this movies gonna look like a million bucks
lugosi has arrived
ed jumps excitedly
oh my god
he yells mr
lugosi is here
now everyone when he walks on the stage nobody is listening so ed uses his megaphone now everyone when he walks on the stage treat him normal
i know bela lugosi is a world famous star and youre all a little excited but were professionals
so if you treat him with respect everything will be alright
the door swings open and bela strides in looking dapper
he glances at the teensy stage and his face falls imperceptibly
ed runs up bounding with enthusiasm
its so great to see you
he glances at his watch and eight oclock on the dot
right on time
i am always on time
well we got a big day planned for you
first were gonna start off a little easy with you in that armchair over there
then once youre up to speed and cooking well reset and bring out the laboratory equipment he leans in and whispers uh eddie do you have my money
oh yeah of course
ed and bela step over to a corner
from a distance ed pulls a wad of money from his pocket and peels off a few bills for bela
the crew watches fascinated
bela is seated in the ratty armchair on the set
harry does his make up
harry glances at belas arm and it is full of track marks
harry grimaces but doesnt say anything
conrad eagerly scurries up
lugosi i know youre very busy but could i have your autograph
cordial of course
conrad hands him a scrap of paper
bela signs it
you know which movie of yours i love mr
the invisible ray
you were great as karloffs sidekick
belas face suddenly hardens
bela insanely rips up the autograph
karloff doesnt deserve to smell my shit
that limey cocksucker can rot in hell for all i care
ed panickedly runs up
jesus connie what did you do
upset close to crying nothin
i told him he was great
how dare that asshole bring up karloff
you think it takes talent to play frankenstein
its just make up and grunting
ed is frozen in fear
he glances across the stage
georgie is flabbergasted
he points urgently at his watch
he motions to conrad get out of here
conrad runs away
ed leans in to bela
youre right bela
now dracula thats a part that takes acting
dracula requires presence its all in the voice and the eyes and the hand bela waves his outstretched arm
ed tries to calm him
look you seem a little agitated
do you maybe wanna take a little break go for a nice walk
and then well come back and shoot the scene
i am ready now
roll the camera
the crew is baffled
ed shrugs at them
roll camera unsure rolling
scene thirty one
the assistant claps the slate in front of bela then runs
its dead quiet
nobody knows whats about to happen
we move in to bela
he suddenly assumes character
like the consumate pro he is
bela gets a wicked sinister leer then starts intoning threateningly bela as the spirit beware
beware of the big green dragon that sits on your doorstep
he eats little boys
puppy dog tails
big fat snails
he is blown away
he quietly mumbles in amazement
dolores studies her script as the crew lights a flimsy kitchen set
ed strolls past nonchalantly removing a ladies wig and earrings
she stares in disbelief
how can you just walk around like that in front of all these people
hon nobodys bothered but you
he gestures look around they couldnt care less
ed this isnt the real world
youve surrounded yourself with say it a little louder
i dont think bela heard you in his trailer
dolores quiets down
she feels bad
i need your help
a scene is being shot on camera
ed as glen and dolores as barbara stare into each others eyes
hes dressed normal and she wears a fuzzy angora sweater
ed as glen my minds in a muddle
i thought i could stop wearing these things
i tried honestly i tried
dolores as barbara tentative glen i dont fully understand this
but maybe together we can work it out
she stands up dramatically takes off her angora sweater and gives it to ed
he holds it meaningfully then smiles proudly
and cut and print it
ed and dolores hug
on a moviola we see the black and white image of dolores taking off her angora and giving it to ed
we pull out
ed and georgie are hunched over watching the movie
ed smiles proudly
and we fade out
the film runs out what do you think
georgie peers at his watch
he shakes his bead
i think its fifty seven minutes long
so did you like it
like a lecturing teacher ed what was the one thing i asked you to do
make it seven reels long ive got contracts with my exhibitors
if it aint over an hour they wont play it
gee i used every frame of film we shot
maybe they wont notice
beat look why dont you let me take over from here
i can do a few tricks pad it out with more stock footage add establishing shots
um i guess good
and one more thing
i think your written directed and starring ed wood credit is a bad idea
i did all those things
hell i even built the props
and you did a bang up job too
but you dont want other producers to know thats you in drag
its a career killer
ed is quite upset
but im proud
i wrote directed and starred in it just like orson welles in citizen kane
well orson welles didnt wear angora sweaters did he
ed is beaten
its the cast and crew screening
the eager two dozen people are packed into a tiny screening room
the lights dim and the movie starts
a library music fanfare and then bela lugosi in glen or glenda everyone applauds excitedly
credits continue featuring daniel davis and dolores fuller the audience is audibly baffled
bunny blurts out
daniel who dolores leans in to ed
ed who is daniel davis
sour some weirdo who likes to wear dresses
on screen dolores looks tenderly at ed
dolores on screen glen
is it another woman
ed as glen nervously ponders his response
but suddenly music thunders in
the movie cuts to buffalo stampeding belas angry face is superimposed over this
bela on screen pull the string
pull the string
people are impressed by this technique
bela nods in approval
out of nowhere cheap jazz music starts and the movie abruptly cuts to sleazy stag party style footage
a bare chested man whips a bound woman
a woman dominates another tied to a large stick
a brunette violently rips off her dress and does a hoochie coochie dance
the crowd is stunned
i didnt shoot that
ed looks back at georgie whos wearing a big satisfied grin
georgie whats with the stag footage
you said you were cutting in establishing shots i did
i established some tits and ass
ed rolls his eyes
he turns back to the movie
everybody is celebrating with a raucous party
people are boozing it up
big band music plays
ed dances with dolores
paul smokes a joint
conrad falls over a table and breaks a lamp
bela dances happily with a cute young redhead
wasnt i something
did you see how i command the screen
eds giddy buddies stumble over with foaming glasses of beer
ed it was superb
a great show
a little strange
but great especially my scenes
just like i always promised
now youre among the immortals
youre movie stars
he raises his glass heres to ed
for making us into something
its a warm moment
they all clink their glasses
dolores kisses ed
were outside a cute little spanish bungalow house
ed and dolores are moving in
they lug furniture from a rented truck
from today on our lives are different
well be swimming laps in the same pool jean harlow did
i dont know
its so much money
were on a roll
these are the moments in life youre supposed to grab
but ed were not even married
and you dont have a job
but you do
and anyway ive got tons of new scripts
and now that i have a track record studios are bound to hire me
she just stares
ed shrugs semi reassuringly
look on the bright side
if we miss the rent whats the worst they can do
toss us out on our ass
the house is moved in
eds unkempt dogs run about
pumped up ed sits on the bed typing fiendishly fast while wearing an angora sweater
a cigarette dangles from his mouth and a bottle of booze lays in his lap
bela sits quietly nearby
how bout a western
people love westerns
but i dont like horses
do i have to get on one
eh forget it
what else is big
his face lights up teenagers
you got the juvenile delinquent his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks who do i play
uh a cop
you play the father
hes angry he doesnt like seeing his son no he doesnt like seeing his daughter behave this way
cautious not to offend well
cant i play the romantic part
im tired of always being the bad guy
you know back in hungary i played romeo
i would like to be the lover again me in a boat with the girl
ed considers this
romance thats great
to engineer your comeback were gonna need a whole slate of pictures
once glen or glenda takes off well slam you into one then another then another
he smiles thats good
i could use the money
but we need to start off with a bang
something we know the audience will want to see
what was your biggest hit
he thinks hmm
my biggest hit
that would probably be dracula
ed crabs a pen and excitedly scrawls out the word dracula
those bastards at universal
i made so much money for them and now i cant get the time of day
so lets make another dracula
lets make the return of dracula
those sons a bitches control the rights
there must be a way to get around that
eds mind is working
he holds out the paper and stares at it
suddenly he grins
he grabs the pen and makes a period after the dr
it now says dr
acula ha ha
doctor acula you can still wear the cape have the fangs
but youre a doctor
not a count
this is very exciting
inspired i gotta type this up while its still fresh
ed rips the paper from his typewriter puts in a blank page and starts typing
were outside the imposing gates of mgm
the lion logo is overhead
ed drives up in his dirty nash rambler convertible
he wears his nicest suit
ed peers nervously at the guard
excuse me im here to see mr
the guard stares suspiciously at ed
his filthy car is leaking oil
whats your name
the man frowns
he looks through his files then finds a parking slip with eds name
he is surprised
eh hes in the executive building
you can park in the reserved section
the room is very posh with fancy paneling and marble floors
ed sits nervously under posters for grand hotel and quo vadis
film cans labled glen or glenda rest in his lap
feldman will see you now
she hits an electric button
a large oak door swings open
behind a giant desk is mr
feldman a glib thin over caffeinated man
he jumps up smiling
ward its a delight to meet you
shaking his hand its wood
puzzled he glances at his appointment book hey what do you know
it is wood
dang secretaries you can never get a good one
so what are you bringing me
looks like you got some film cans
feldman some people have resumes to show
ive got my own movie
well good for you
i just made this picture over at screen classics
it opens next week
hmm dont know them
nobody in town has seen it so im givin you first crack at my talents
i cant wait to take a look
he claps his hands so whats up next
ed leans in
feldman i dont believe in thinking small
so ive got a whole slate of pictures for you the vampires tomb the ghoul goes west
and doctor acula
i dont get it
acula ed writes it out dr
acula then waves it in feldmans face
i get it
beat i dont like it
but bela lugosis in it
lugosis washed up
what else you got
lugosi was of his pitch
ive got another project i wasnt gonna tell you about
lugosis in it but hes got a smaller part
the lead is an ingenue a sterling young actress named dolores fuller
the title is bride of the atom
atomic age stuff huh
i like it
he smiles ill tell you what mr
why dont you leave those film cans and my associates and i will take a look at your little opus
maybe we can do business together
ed is elated
feldman and his fellow smarmy executives sit in a plush screening room
they are viewing glen or glenda
on screen ed is in drag
a solemn narrator within the movie speaks give this man satin undies a dress and a sweater
and hes the happiest man in the world
he can work better think better even play better and be more of a credit to his community and his government
they are stupefied
what the hell is this
is this an actual movie
it cant be
its fuckin ridiculous
feldman squints at the screen
wait a minute that guy in the dress hes the one i met with today
this must be a big put on
he chuckles its probably another one of billy wellmans practical jokes
everybody suddenly starts howling with laughter
ed zooms up and chipperly jumps from his car
he buys a los angeles herald express eagerly opens it to the entertainment pages
and then gets a confused look
ed quickly starts rifling through the pages something is wrong
ed angrily shouts into the phone
georgie what happened
i thought glen or glenda was opening next week
wheres the ads
an old fashioned split screen of georgie on the phone appears
pissed off wheres the ads
the ads are in alabama indiana and missouri
you schmuck it aint gonna play l
because i cant sell it to save my life
you made a goddamn feathered fish
is it an art film a horror show a hygiene flick
im beggin people to book it
insulted maybe it needs special handling
screw you wood
i even sunk more money into different titles transvestite he or she
i led two lives
it doesnt matter
nobody wants to see the piece of shit
you cant talk that way about my movie
i wish it was your movie
i wish i hadnt blown every dime i ever made into this stinkbomb
if i ever see you again ill kill you
georgie slams down the phone
his split screen wipes off leaving ed standing alone
ed stares at the phone then quietly hangs it up
a wrestler throws another wrestler at the mat
the crowd cheers raucously
were at the saturday night wrestling matches
in the stands are ed dolores bunny and bunnys new young male friend
seated around them are hollering truckers and ex marines
bunny giggles and nudges gloomy ed
so guess where im going next weekend
i dont know
and guess what im going to do there
not enjoying this game i dunno
lie on the beach
im getting my first series of hormone shots
and once those babies kick in theyre gonna remove my organs and make me a woman
ed is astonished
are you serious
ive dreamed of it for years but your movie made me realize ive got to take action
the truckers nearby stare
dolores covers her face
will you keep it down
the crowd suddenly roars and jumps up
a favorite wrestler has entered the ring massive tor johnson
tor is an incredible sight a bald lumbering behemoth
ring announcer amplified now entering the ring in the gold trunks bone crunching pounds of pure strength the swedish angel
the crowd goes apeshit
the stands are going to collapse from the shouting
eds eyes are the size of saucers
my god look at that guy
hes a mountain
the bell rings
tor quickly grabs his opponent a man in a blue mask and throws him at the ground
then tor jumps onto his stomach easily picks him up and heaves him at the ropes
ed is flabbergasted
ive never seen anything like him
and once im a woman jean claude and i are getting married eyes glued to the ring ssh
hes so big
hes a monster can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie
he screams maniacally in swedish
tor lifts the opponent over his head and tosses him into the stands
three rows of chairs get knocked over
a tiny miniature european car pulls up
tor johnson is squeezed inside ludicrously oversized for this vehicle
tor carefully wedges himself out and enters the bar
this rowdy bar is packed with burly wrestlers
tor walks in and men cheerily yell out hey tor
in person he actually seems a jolly outgoing fellow
ed waves from the corner mr
johnson over here
tor smiles and lumbers over glad you could fit me in your schedule
in a hoarse swedish accent da pleasure be mine
they shake hands
eds hands look like a babys in tors giant mitts
tor tries to sit in the booth
but he cant fit
could we moovf to table
oh of course
ed jumps up
they move to a large table
now tor is happy
he starts shoveling beer nuts into his mouth
have you ever thought about becoming an actor
he chuckles mm not good lookink enough
i think youre quite handsome
with hair yah
but i must shave head for wrestlink
it scare da crowds
dey like that
well i think youd be a sensation in pictures
but what bout accent
some people tink i haf too much accent
nah that doesnt matter
its a visual medium
a waitress saunters over
tor what can i get ya
ill haf eight beers
nonchalant to ed and you
uhh ill have just one
she walks off
tor shakes the now empty nut bowl
and more nuts
ed tries to grab tors attention
so anyway ive got this new script bride of the atom and theres a part youre ideal for lobo
but he has a heart and at the end he saves the girl
he laughs merrily i like
when do movie shoot
hopefully very soon
im just awaiting the final okay from mr
feldman at mgm
ed and dolores are asleep
suddenly the phone rings
ed fumbles for it and groggily answers
we hear belas weak voice
bela on phone eddie
bela on phone eddie
please come over click
the phone hangs up
ed is very alarmed
the wind is blowing
eds nash roars up and he jumps out a coat over his pajamas
he runs up and pounds on belas door
ed tries the door
ed steps into the dark room and is stunned by what he sees bela is slumped on the floor pasty white eyes glazed
a rubber tube is tied on his arm and a hypodermic needle lies next to him
the dogs crouch behind him whimpering despondent bela looks up through half opened eyes
aghast ed runs over
bela what happened
i didnt feel well
let me take you to the hospital
just take me to the couch
he picks up the old man and carries him across the room to the couch
the large portrait of bela young and robust peers down
should i call a doctor
this happens all the time
ed puts a pillow under belas head
is there anything i can get you
distressed i dont know how to make goulash
ed sits next to him
an awkward pause
whats in the needle
morphine with a demerol chaser
he starts crying eddie im so broke
i dont know what im gonna do
ill do something
ed stands outside mgm talking into a phone at the guard gate
ed on phone mr
i havent been able to get through so i just showed up
yeah out front
so are we gonna be working together
his face slowly falls really worst film you ever saw
beat well my next one will be better
dolores tries to cheer up gloomy ed
hes wearing angora
im no good
ed its just one mans opinion
bela needs a job
i cant even get a film going
listless but of course i cant i made the worst movie of all time
all i wanna do is tell stories
the things i find interesting
well maybe youre not studio kind of material
maybe you just need to raise the money yourself
ed looks up
ed sits opposite a loan officer
the movie is called bride of the atom
ed continues pitching to three dentists in white coats
it will star bela lugosi
each of you would put up
ed stands at a busy intersection
he yells into a phone
yes thats right
the bela lugosi
hes still alive
is he available friday night
gee i suppose so
cut to were backstage at a os variety show
its exciting live tv showgirls techies and cast members dart about in a state of hyped up tumult
bela and ed sit in his dressing room running lines
bela is in his count outfit cape jet black hair red lips etc
they both read off scripts
i am the count
i am slick slomopavitz seeker of adventure
say thats a funny place to sleep
it is my home
oh tract housing huh
you need a new real estate agent
beg to differ
this casket incarpratates er inporporates ed interrupts
no bela thats incorporates
look just say this casket has
how do they expect a hungarian to pronounce this dialogue
this live television is madness
an assistant knocks and sticks her head in
five minutes mr
ed and bela stand in the wings
onstage is the show host a cheesy comedian
he is doing a routine with criswell the famed psychic who opened this movie
criswell wears a tux and a turban and is acting mysterious
and then whats gonna happen
in the automobile will have retractable wings so it can fly
sounds like a heck of a way to beat traffic
criswell rubs his temples enigmatically
by man will have colonized mars
millions of people will live there
ed is mesmerized
aint that something
were out in the audience
the curtain rises on a spooky set shadows cobwebs and a coffin in the center
the host walks onstage to huge applause
hes playing his slick character a befuddled moron in a funny hat
the host shines a flashlight around and then the coffin opens
bela sits up
theres more greetings
i am the count
i am slick slomopavitz seeker of adventure
the audience laughs
say thats a funny place to sleep
it is my home
oh tract housing huh
he starts ad libbing i guess i shouldnt complain about my duplex in burbank
what a dump
some places have a murphy bed this place has a murphy shower i still dont know where to hang the towels
the audience howls with laughter
bela is totally lost
he seems incredibly confused
uh beg to differ
beg to differ
hey im talkin about my duplex in burbank
terrified groping uh greetings
i am the count
ed covers his face in embarrassment
the host angrily storms past
i told you we shouldve gotten karloff
a door opens and ed and bela quietly step out
bela dont worry
youre better than all this crap
distraught i never said i could ad lib
forget about it
well make our new movie and youll be a star again
they shuffle away
until criswell and his snazzy entourage burst around a corner
even in person criswell is ethereal and quite self important
he is delighted to see bela
lugosi it is an unparalleled privilege to meet you
allow me to introduce myself
i am criswell
morose its a pleasure
ah cheer up
dont lose heart over what happened tonight
he points at his temple i predict that your next project will be an outstanding success
and who may you be
edward wood sir
the director of glen or glenda
startled h howd you know
i know all
latin horns blast onstage of this hopping os nightclub
cigarette girls roam about
seated at a front table is ed bela and criswells group
everyones plastered and laughing
criswell shouts above the din at a waiter
bring me two more beefeater martinis
eddie will have another whiskey dagmars a rum and coke moustapha and king are chablis hey bela would you like a wine
i never drink wine
the whole table cracks up
bela cheers up
ed turns to criswell
hey cris howd you know wed be living on mars by
howd you know it wouldnt be or even
i dont understand
i made it up
eds jaw drops
theres no such thing as a psychic
people believe my folderol because i wear a turban and a black tuxedo
its that easy
eddie were in show biz
its all about razzle dazzle
if you dress nice and talk well people will swallow anything
criswell smiles knowingly
ed nods at this profound wisdom
were outside the legendary hat shaped restaurant
a large eldorado pulls up and a conservative man and his plump wife step out and approach the doorman
were here for the wood party
ah that would be in the venetian room sir
the couple raise their eyebrows
a large banner says bride of the atom next years smash in a private back room ed is throwing a lavish backers party
all his riff raff friends are dressed in tuxedos and gowns strutting about with flutes of champagne like theyre extras in the great gatsby
bewildered potential backers wander around
ed shmoozes them
were gonna have the most terrifying monster ever seen on film
a ghastly creature created from an atomic mutation
i dont like scary movies
i go more for ones with love stories
without dropping a beat well thats what this movie is a heartbreaking romance
its about a young reporter janet lawton in love with a young cop dick craig
conrad and paul sit in a corner
conrad has a shoe off and is scratching his foot
ed alarmedly runs over
what do you think youre doin
these shoes are itchy
you cant sit you gotta walk around with good posture
you want these people to think we have class
otherwise theyll never invest in our movie
two amazed backers have their hands around tors giant arm
bernie get a load of this guy
proud of his size biceps
youre quite a specimen
beat and youre gonna be in the picture
i play lobo
an excited hick backer shakes belas hand
lugosi i cant believe im meeting you in person
this is one of the most exciting moments of my life
and you are
i manufacture toothpaste tubes
criswell struts in the b
talking to someone
i predict bride of the atom will be the biggest moneymaker of all time
in the f
ed introduces dolores to a southern backer
and this is lovely starlet dolores fuller who will play janet lawton
and how much will this picture cost
in a normal studio it would be half a million with all their wasteful overhead and fancy offices
but because were more efficient we can bring it in for seventy grand
well ill consider it
ed and his buddies wave goodbye to the departing backers
to ed so howd we do
faking a big smile but sotto voce to bela we didnt make a dime
a valet hands the car keys to the conservative backer
thats twenty five cents sir
the man glances at his wife
i gave all my money to the babysitter
the man grimaces
he checks his pockets pulls out a handful of pennies and counts them out
ed sits in a chaise lounge by the pool studying papers and drinking shots of whiskey
hes in a womans pantsuit and fuzzy slippers
dolores marches out
ed the landlord called again
he wants his money
tell him bride is in pre production
ed the landlord doesnt care
thats the problem
nobody cares about my movie
im tryin so hard i dont know what else to do
dont get angry at me
maybe you just need a day job
upset dolores dont you understand
im a director now
i made glen or glenda
directing is my day job
irate all i know is ever since glen or glenda all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes
suddenly paul hesitantly steps through the back gate
uh yoo hoo
sorry to interrupt but i got some big news
well my cousin fred met this dame from back east
shes from old money and he thinks shes loaded
and heres the kicker shes very interested in the picture business
he slowly smiles
its like sun breaking through rain clouds
were at a fancy outdoor brunch
ed is shaking hands with pretty loretta king a pale brunette in a classy dress
pleased to meet you
im loretta king
i understand you just moved here
hollywood is oh so exciting
a waiter walks over with a water pitcher
suddenly freaking out no
im terribly allergic to them
the waiter is bewildered
he hurries away
ed leans in
so my associate mr
marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture
perhaps a small amount of money
she smiles how much do one of your motion pictures cost
for this one we need
that seems very reasonable for an entire picture
ed perks up
shes a live one
ed pulls a script from his briefcase and hands it to her
perhaps youd like to look at the photoplay
oh my this is very interesting
she skims the pages say
do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts
very enthused oh of course
theres a couple characters youd be perfect for the secretary at the newspaper office or the file clerk
those sound kind of small
stopping at a page oh heres one that looks good janet lawton
id sure like to play her
j janet lawton
yes janet layton is clearly the part to play
shes got some real meaty scenes
cant you just see me in that part
he is aghast
what a stomach churning decision
he stares at loretta then slowly croaks a response
beat youd be perfect
we hear dishes being violently thrown
dolores screams inside
you two timing dress wearing son of a bitch
dolores is crying and screaming angrily
ed ducks the objects she hurls at him
it was the only way i could get the movie made
who do you thinks been paying the rent
who helped type your script and did all your grunt work
what did you want me to say
i wanted you to say no
i wrote the part for my girlfriend dolores
but theres plenty of other parts
like what nervous the secretary
or the file clerk
dolores is stunned
she hurls a pot at ed
it slams him in the head
the sets are being erected for bride of the atom
the crew hurries about the small stage as ed energetically supervises
he has a large band aid on his head
this is gonna be belas laboratory so it should be real impressive
like one of those mad scientist movies
i want beakers and test tubes and one of those electrical things that buzzes
you mean a tesla coil
if you say so
tor lumbers over in his ripped lobo outfit
his face has fake gashed up scars
tor holds the script
i haf question bout script
my vife greta she read
and she no like
was the third act too intense
trying to be polite no
she tink lobo is waste of my time
lobo dont talk
but tor its a starring part
youre second billed
bela he talk
loretta she talk
but tor he no talk
he quickly puts a spin on this
tor dialogue is overrated
you look at the classic film actors who are they
they didnt talk
they did it all with their face
still bothered but greta say loretta walks over holding two dresses
eddie which dress do you like better
i dont know
he yells o
hey bill which dress is better for you the green or the red one
cameraman bill is standing at the camera
which one is the red one
confused what do you mean
i mean i cant see the difference
im color blind
beat but i like the dark gray one
the crew is shooting on a spooky castle foyer set
bela enters wearing a lab coat costume
as he slowly crosses the old man rubs his hands fiendishly
ed yells live direction through a megaphone
okay youre dr
youve worked so hard on this experisent and you dont want to see it fail
bela stops to emote no youre not that upset
you want to keep moving
you wanna cross the room
bela exits okay cut
ed claps his hands triumphantly
alright lets go immediately to scene
tor are you in place
okay cue rainstorm
behind the window conrad pours a watering can
and roll camera
tor enters but can barely squeeze his bulk through the door
finally he enters
ed yells through the segaphone
okay youre lobo
youve worked so hard helping dr
vornoff on this experiment and you dont want to see it fail
tor stops to emote no youre not that upset
you want to keep moving
you wanna cross the room
tor exits okay cut
bela talks to tor
at universal they shot two scenes a day
eddie can knock off twenty or thirty
cameraman bill leans in to ed
hey ed shouldnt we do another take
big baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway
no its fine
in actuality lobo would struggle with that problem every day
they are back on the completed lab set
beyond the bunsen burners and beakers is a kitchenette in the corner
wow this lab looks great
except why is there a stove and refrigerator
we couldnt afford any more props
if it seems weird maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner
nah itll work
bela is asleep on a couch
ed nudges him
bela are you ready
he groggily wakes up mmph
where am i
youre shooting bride of the atom
he stands up then grimaces in pain
so he pulls two bright little pills from his pocket and swallows them
ed walks bela onto the lab set
youll be sitting on the right
he glares at the sparking tesla coils im not getting near that goddamn thing
one of those burned me on the return of chandu
then youll be sitting on the left ed turns to tor and loretta
she wears a wedding gown
heres the scene
loretta youre in a trance
you glide in and get on the operating table
now tor youre supposed to tie her down
but you have an angora fetish
and when you rub that swatch of angora it makes you refuse so bela has to discipline you
the scene begins
bela as vornoff now we are ready for the girl
bela does his patented hypnotic arm wave
he actually has a powerful intensity
loretta staggers in eyes glazed
like a zombie she climbs onto the operating table
dear you are a woman of super strength and beauty
a lovely vision of exquisitely beauty shit
he breaks character damn
eddie im sorry i cant remember all this
im an old man
its too long
thats fine bela
were still rolling
just say dear youre lovely
he snaps back into character dear youre lovely
he turns to tor strap her to the table
tor starts to tie loretta down then gets distracted by a piece of angora hooked to his waist
he rubs it lovingly calmed then suddenly refuses
bela is furious
do as i command you
bela pulls out an oversized bullwhip and starts whipping tor
tor screams in agony
ill teach you to disobey me
bela chases tor around the set whipping him
he dances about happily
i love being movie star
tor jubilantly hugs loretta
not so hard tor
a surly stage manager strides over to ed
your check bounced
okay ill get you the money later
i need it now
ed nods grimly
he grabs loretta and takes her aside
sorry to bother you while were shooting but the guy who owns the stage needs his money
well then you should pay him shouldnt you
he smiles yeah
theres a pause
they stare at each other
i kinda need it now
baffled what are you looking at me like that for
i already gave you my three hundred
well i need the other sixty thousand
what other sixty thousand
the other sixty thousand you said youd give me
i gave you everything i have in the world three hundred dollars
he looks like he s going to throw up
oh my god
the large stage door slams shut
eds disoriented cast and crew stand in the street
bela tor and loretta are still in costume
ed looks totally dazed
he blinks in the bright sunlight
were back at the brown derby for another backers party
the same banner is hanging bride of the atom next years smash the whole crowd is there dressed up
bela sits in the corner knocking back a drink
here we go again
paul whispers to bunny
so is dolores coming
very catty i cant imagine why
i wouldnt put up with a boyfriend who sold me out for three hundred dollars
ed stands with a circle of potential backers
he has an edge of desperation weve never seen before
lemme tell you you cant lose
and if you dont like that its romantic
bela lugosi portrays dr
vornoff and lovely ingenue loretta king is reporter janet lawton
lugosi looks pretty old
he squints across the room which role is vampira playing
vampira bewildered why do you ask
well i see her standing over there
the guy points
ed turns and looks and vampira is standing in the next room shes at a different party
shes playing beat could you excuse me one moment
ed dashes from the room
vampira is drinking with a bunch of artsy fartsy types
shes in street clothes but clearly recognizable
ed runs up
excuse me miss vampira
sweaty you dont know me but my name is ed wood
im a film producer
im currently in production on a science fiction piece with bela lugosi and swedish wrestler tor johnson
and i saw you here and i thought kismet
vampira stares totally uncomprehending
i dont understand
do you want my autograph
i think my film is perfect for you
you want me to show it on my tv program
well i got nothing to do with that
you should call up the station manager at channel seven unyielding no
i dont want you to show the movie i want you to be in it see maybe i should explain we started shooting but then after three days we got
so were having a backers party to raise some more money
perhaps youd like to come next door and meet some of the backers
vampire glances at her friends
they uncomfortably turn away
uh look im with some friends and were about to eat begging please
itll only take a minute
you can have some hors doeuvres and meet my backers
theres a really nice dentist from oxnard
pissed off look buddy im a big star
ive got real offers from real studios
i dont need to blow some dentist for a part
so forget it
the backers glance into the next room
ed is in front of vampira begging on his hands and knees
to another backer im getting a bad feeling about this
lets get out of here
the backers pick up their coats
through the doorway ed sees this
he jumps up and frantically runs back in
where are you guys going
you cant leave
running out goodbye mr
insane you cant go
you havent seen the storyboards
the backers run out of the room
ed shouts after them
if you dont have the balls to roll the dice then i dont want your stinking money
please come back
ed and dolores are being evicted
their belongings are scattered in front
they bitterly carry furniture out of the house
ed stumbles and slurs his speech
he is drunk goddamn landlord
i told you this was gonna happen
maybe if youd come to the backers party i wouldve gotten the money
why would a bit player impress a backer
he starts yelling look how many times can i say im sorry
i blew it
i thought she was rich
thats a good reason to dump your girlfriend
i didnt dump you get it through your skull i just recast the part
ed drops the furniture
he flops onto the sidewalk
youre a fuckin mess
look we gotta figure out where were gonna stay
im going to my mothers
does she have room for me
dolores shakes her head
i think you should stay with one of your friends
ed and bela stroll through a parking lot
ed is sobered up and remorseful
bela wears a beret and smokes a huge cigar
bela i dont know what im doin anymore
this is going to raise your spirits
they reach the strange entrance to an avant garde eastern based quasi religious temple
bela puts out his cigar and they enter the oversized doors
sphinxes and bodhisatvas peer down from the marble walls
a service is in progress
a wiry enigmatic lecturer speaks
thou eternal sun who has covered the consciousness with thy golden disc do thou remove the veil so that i may see the truth within
bela leads ed to a seat stepping past men in fezzes and odd elderly women in fur coats
as the lecture continues ed whispers in bafflement
what is this place
this is the philosophical research society
a refuge for free thinkers
ive been coming here for twenty years
for the truth which is within thee is within me
and i am truth
most people in this country they know nothing about eastern mysticism
they are afraid of it
beat but i am open minded
it gives me hope
we have the wisdom to govern and the divine right to inherit the earth in good condition
we have the power to build worlds
ed leans in to bela
was i wrong to cast loretta
bad decisions are easy to live with
just keep looking forward
but was it a bad decision
at the time i thought her money would save the movie
eddie you screwed up
he nods yeah i did
the lecture is over
the speaker shakes hands with people
bela leads ed along
in life the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just dont know
where right or wrong will never be answered
beat years ago the hungarians contacted me
the government wanted me to come home to be minister of culture
it was a very impressive offer
fancy offices a big home
id be treated like a king
so why didnt you do it
i didnt know if it was a trick
they might arrest me and throw me in a gulag
pause i am hungarys most famous emigrant
theyd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave
but maybe not
so instead i stayed here waiting for my comeback
the next film the next film
that would be the one
they reach the exit
ed stops in the huge doorway
your next film
that will be the one
bela smiles sweetly
were in a noisy meat packing plant
workers in blood stained aprons slam cleavers into hunks of beef
ed walks down an aisle with donald e
mccoy a wealthy texan meat man
old man mccoy is a tough talking tobacco chewing straight shooter
and then dr
vornoff falls in the pit and his own octopus attacks and eats him
old man mccoy whew
thats quite a story
so you made the movie and now you want to make it again
gently correcting him no
we shot ten minutes of the movie and now were looking for completion funds
old man mccoy son youre too vague
i come from the world of business
i need to know what i get for my investment
movies are very popular
you could make a lot of money
old man mccoy yeah but most of em flop dont they
what am i tangibly guaranteed
you get executive producer credit
old man mccoy that dont mean diddley
he suddenly shouts angrily billy bob
youre cutting em too mccoy grabs a cleaver from a worker and slams it into a chop
mccoy how can i make you happy
old man mccoy cut to the chase heh
thats very good
mccoy spits his tobacco
old man mccoy okay two things
number one i want the movie to end with a big explosion
sky full of smoke
but the story ends with dr
vornoff falling in the pit old man mccoy not anymore
and number two ive got a son
hes a little slow but a good boy
and something tells me hed make a hell of a leading man
under eds cheery frozen smile his face clearly falls
were at a rowdy wrestling match
tor johnson is in the middle of a screaming four man tag team event
tor throws his opponent to the ground then tags with his partner and goes to the corner
suddenly a wrestling coach runs up dragging a telephone on a very long cord
tor you got a phone call
they said it was an emergency
he hands sweaty tor the phone
tor speaks into it
tor this is ed
glad i could find you
i got the money and we resume shooting tomorrow morning
but im in utah
then youll have to drive all night
im counting on you big guy
breakfast is at seven
ed hangs up
tor is flabbergasted
bride of the atom is back in production
eds stock company is reunited
people drink coffee and gossip
this is unbelievable
i woulda bet a million bucks that ed wouldnt finish this picture
it aint finished yet
anything could happen
the stage door opens and standing there in silhouette is dolores everybody quiets
people glance nervously at loretta
stay out of scratching distance
ed runs over
dolores is beautifully made up and wearing a furry angora sweater
ed speaks awkwardly
honey you made it
i wasnt sure you got my message
icy of course im here
today is the file clerks big scene
i see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here
she looks around say whos the lug
in a corner standing by himself is dumb tony mccoy old man mccoys worthless son
hes a good looking moody hunk
tony is practicing his lines from a script but hes terribly stiff
now janet i want you straying away oops staying away from the old willows place
thats tony mccoy
hes playing lieutenant dick craig
how much money did he put up
beat but his dad gave me fifty grand
snide wood productions
the mark of quality
hey the movies getting made thats the main thing
dolores shakes her head contemptuously
then she strides off
ed stands alone feeling bad
the set is a one wall office hallway a doorway and a water cooler
loretta sits in a make up chair as harry works on her
hey harry long time no see
harry turns surprised
dolores stands behind him
theres a thick tension
he smiles anxiously
oh youre dolores
ive heard so much about you
im loretta king
she chipperly jumps up here take the chair
bitchy dont be silly let harry finish
you still need more work
no im done
all i needed was a touch up
mm that mole still shows
ed quickly steps in
you both look fine
why dont we talk about the scene
janet lawton has discovered that dr
vornoff bought the old willows estate
so now she wants to prove that all the monster stories are true
dolores nods sourly
she s in a trouble making mood
eddie whats my motivation
thrown off oh
well youre the file clerk
youre hurrying into the next room when you bump into janet
but whats our relationship
are we good friends or is she just a casual acquaintance
annoyed dolores i got five days to shoot this movie
quit kidding around
were watching dailies
projected on screen a camera assistant claps the slate
we hear ed yell action
loretta hurries down the hallway
dolores sees her run past and shouts out
dolores as file clerk janet the boss has been looking for you
loretta as janet lawton thanks
loretta runs out
dolores just stands there
we hear ed dolores turns deadpan to the camera
of course it was
the film runs out
the screening room lights come up on the crew
ed sits in gloomy haze
suddenly theres loud clapping from the back of the room
he smiles cris you made it
thanks a lot
im always happy to assist in a little larceny
g pink cadillac convertible races down the ed and criswell are in front and tor conrad and paul to the back
my head is cold
you know how much this car cost me
ten thousand dollars
miss mae west herself sold it to me
she said cris you belong in a pink cadillac
criswell turns to ed
incidentally you promise youre not going to scratch my car
cocky i told you the octopus is made of rubber
this is a piece o cake
the five men climb over a fence
theyre breaking into republic studios
paul is panicked
ed you said you were getting permission
uh i couldnt reach the guy
he was in meetings all day
but thisll be great i promise
ed smiles at conrad
im no good at climbink
tor gives up and simply bashes through the locked gate
everyone is amazed
im good at bashink
hey keep it down
my publicist will throttle me if we get caught
they all sneak across the shadowy lot
remnants of old scary sets tower over them
they reach a stage door
ed tries it but its locked
i thought they kept this open
everyone looks at tor
lobo will fix
tor grabs the heavy door and easily snaps the lock
this place is the mythic eclectic prop room
guillotines rocketships a stuffed vulture
strange mysterious props from untold movies loom everywhere in the darkness
its a place of wonderment and fear
the men stare in awe
this place gives se the creeps
lets get the hell out of here
not so fast
first we have to get it down
ed gestures above
everyone glances straight up
a giant octopus is lashed to the ceiling
conrad and criswell are way up on the catwalk holding onto dangling paul by his belt
paul leans way out reaching for the octopus
he shouts nervously
youre sure this is gonna work
youre sure standing straight below is tor
the swede has his arms outstretched waiting
ed supervises a good distance away
he motions to paul
paul gulps then unties the octopus
it drops incredibly fast
the thing must weigh half a ton
tors eyes widen
and the octopus smashes straight on top of him
tor is gone from sight
one of the eight tentacles snaps off
oh my god
we killed him
ed runs to the octopus and looks for tor underneath
are you okay
and then the octopus flips over
tor sits up battered but smiling
bedder than wrestlink
the five men hurry across the lot carrying the hubongous octopus on their shoulders
suddenly a flashlight shines on them
what are you doing
the men jump with fear
they break into a fast waddling run
thank god tor broke the fence
the team runs through the busted gate and escapes
the cadillac screeches away
the octopus flops on top of the five men
the movie crew is setting up for a big night shoot
lights and generators are sprawled across this isolated area
tony mccoy perches goofily on his own personalized chair
he runs lines by himself
now janet i want you staying away from the old willows place
the octopus lays in a dried up riverbed
theres only about an inch of water
ed yells at conrad
you dont understand
the octopus is supposed to live in a lake this is kind of a stream no
it has to be underwater
ed storms away
conrad scratches his head
bela sits inertly in the back of an open car
he weakly hails over ed
eddie im so tired
i dont know if i can handle a night shoot
you look great suddenly he catches himself he speaks more sincerely look uh why dont you lie down and take a little nap
well film around you for a while
ed smiles warmly then walks off
bela stares after him then absent mindedly searches through his pockets
finally he finds what hes looking for a rubber tube
bela looks to make sure no ones around then ties the tube around his upper arm
crew members have dammed up the end of the river and bunny fills it with a hose
there is now a foot of water ed stands at the shore admiring it
this is looking good
he turns to paul paul wheres the octopus motor
what octopus motor
you know to make the legs move defensive hey dont blame me
you didnt say anything about no motor when i was up on that ceiling
bela stumbles up with a dazed smile
lets shoot this fucker
where do i go
youll be fighting with the octopus
out there he points at the water what happened to the stream
thisll look a lot better
we have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater
oh for christs sake
bela rolls up his pants and wades out into the water
goddamn its cold
once youre in it it warms up
you come out here
beat hey toss me that j
a crew member throws bela a bottle of jack daniels
bela pops the cap and chugs half the bottle in one swig
he licks his lips then climbs onto the octopus
how do we turn this thing on
bela somebody misplaced the motor
so when you wrestle the octopus shake the legs a bit to make it look like its killing you
bela stares deadpan
do you know i turned down frankenstein
after i did dracula the studio offered me frankenstein
but i turned it down the part wasnt sexy enough
it was too degrading for a big star like me
the crew glances at ed
bela ive got twenty five scenes to shoot tonight
dont let me slow you down
lets put it on film
bela takes another swig of j
then throws it off camera
bela starts flailing around the octopus legs and screaming in horror
this image is truly ridiculous
ed is pleased
some crew members nod pretty good
then suddenly the dam walls burst
the water rushes from the lake and floods the park below
crew members straggle in for the final shoot
everybody looks bleary eyed from last night
ed stands cheerily at the entrance greeting them
just one more day
just have some coffee youll feel better
tony staggers up
wood i only got one hour of sleep
well i got no sleep and i feel great
ed sees bela slowly shuffling along
ed runs over to him
i just wanna thank you again for last night
exhausted thats fine eddie
all in the line of duty
i want you to know how much i appreciate what youve done for me
a great man like you shouldnt have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning
well there arent too many other fellas id do it for
he smiles then pulls out a script page i wrote something special for you
i got to thinking about all the sacrifices youve made
and so i wrote you a new final speech
ed hands him the paper
bela starts reading it as ed watches anxiously
bela is very touched
still reading eddie this is quite a scene
i know its a lot to give you at the last second
bela looks up
these lines ill have no problem remembering
they are shooting
ed watches off camera as bela acts a somber scene with an actor playing professor strowski a threatening european
our government wants you to return
to continue your experiments there
where you can have everything at your disposal
bela as vornoff my dear professor strowski twenty years ago i was banned from my home land
i was classed as a madman a charlatan outlawed in the world of science which previously honored me as a genius
he gets very subdued now here in this forsaken jungle hell i have proven that i am alright
yes the authorities have learned how correct your findings were
so i am here sent to bring you home
i have no home
living like an animal the jungle is my home
but i will show the world that i can be its master
i shall perfect my own race of people a race of atomic supermen that will conquer the world
its an incredible performance of crowning tragedy
bela is totally drained
he is very moved
he whispers barely audible
its a wrap
the wrap party is being thrown in the meat packing plant
people laugh and shout and carry on
tor pours booze in the punch
r b music plays
old man mccoy dances with loretta
bunny dances with a young stud
dolores stands by herself
bela and criswell are giggling
so you sleep in coffins
there is nothing more comfortable
i cant believe this
sleep in coffins
my father ran a mortuary its an old habit
they clink beers
outside vampira and two girl friends walk up
they peer at a tin sign
mccoy meat packing
are you sure theres a party here
holding an invitation yeah i got this invitation
its a bride of the atom party whatever that means
they open the large steel door and inside is the wild bash
across the room paul and conrad chat
glen or glenda now that was a hell of a picture
well this new ones gonna be a hundred times better
is that possible
dolores overhears this
she stares in disbelief
someone changes the record
brassy stripper music begins
a door opens and ed struts out in full gaudy drag
they start whistling and hollaring
ed grins and starts into a wacky bump and grind
go baby go
bunny runs up and sticks a dollar bill between eds fake tits
people laugh hysterically
dolores is appalled
ed shimmies to the music blowing kisses all around
he sees vampira and waves
vampiras jaw drops in recognition
i dont believe it
its him ed sashays up to bela and dances a few steps with him
the music is building to a climax
ed hurries off to center stage and as the music ends he does a final swing of his hips then suddenly yanks out his teeth
this brings down the house
everyone stamps their feet and claps crazily
everyone except dolores
suddenly she explodes
you people are insane
take a look around youre all freaks
the room quiets
dolores has snapped
youre wasting your lives making shit
these movies are terrible
beat i cant take it any longer
the group is shocked
dolores runs out of the party
ed just stands dumbstruck
then he chases after her in his high heels and dress
dolores runs across the parking lot in tears
ed catches up with her
ed its over
i need a normal life
hurt did you really mean those things you said
im tired of living on the fringe
but you used to say ed
i just stuck it out so you could finish your movie
pause now that its done so am i
she turns and walks away
ed is crushed
he stands motionless in his dress in the dark
eds new home is a single apartment still filled with moving boxes
half eaten plates of food are scattered about
ed lies asleep in bed unshaven in the middle of the day
the phone rings
ed awakens and woozily answers it
tor on phone ed dit i wake you
its two in avternoon
no i was just doin a little work
tor on phone bullchit
you been like dis too many days
i want to cheer you up
ed drives his nash though a tract valley neighborhood and reaches tors little house
ed gets out still looking groggy
he walks up the tulip lined path and rings the doorbell
clanging swedish chimes bong inside
the door flies open and tor appears beaming
edvard you come
tor gives ed a back breaking hug
ed steps in
the house is filled with cuckoo clocks and little swedish knick knacks
tor gestures proudly
im so happy you visit
meet my family
greta karl and connie
three colossal people lumber out
tor has the largest family weve ever seen
not fat but big boned greta is tors gigantic swedish wife and karl and connie are their two elephantine children
they adlib greetings hallo
is a pleasure
ed cannot believe what hes seeing
everyone noisily eats dinner
the table looks like a smorgasbord
entire hams turkeys a full case of beer incredible quantities are being shoveled in
tor empties a beer in one gulp then opens another
pass the meatballs
this strudel is delicious mama
ed is stupefied
he picks at a little dainty serving
youre not eatink
uh i dont have much of an appetite lately
the food will make you feel bedder
look at me im da happiest guy i know
all the johnsons chuckle
id be happy too if i had such a great family
you just havent met right woman yet
that cabbage goes right through me
tor stands and hurries from the room
ed awkwardly makes conversation
greta your husband is a terrific actor
you should come down and visit the set
i dont think so
no its really no problem at all
steely i do not approve of what you do with my husband tor
he is not a monster
these horror pictures are humiliating
ed has no response
theres a loud o
slam falling porcelain then tor shouts furiously in swedish
earl and connie begin giggling
ed is totally baffled
tor runs out angrily holding a broken toilet seat
it is split in two
look it happened again
ed is boggle eyed
this house is sadness
tor i should be getting home
you must try our hot glug
its very late
tor and ed sit in the living room drinking from a steaming pot of hot stilled wine
they are smashed
my friend you tink greta is first woman i ever see
many duds before i find her
but i thought me and dolores had something
a good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish
tor finishes his glug and then his eyes roll back into his head and he falls off the couch
he starts snoring
ed stares at tor then gets up
ed turns off the lights and goes home
ed smokes a cigarette and watches tv
vampira is doing her shtick
vampira on tv ooo
that was so scary it gave me goosebumps
someone quacks os
she pretends to be angry no dummy
i didnt say goose i said goosebumps
well be sure to join me next week for the mummys curse
vampira blows a kiss then disappears into the mist
a used car commercial abruptly comes on
he stares at the tv then picks up the phone
vampira is walking off stage
she removes her black wig
god we need some better jokes on this show
a production assistant carries over a phone
vampira you got a phone call
at this hour
she takes the phone hello
hi this is ed wood
you came to my party
i directed bride of the atom
ed pauses nervously
well i was wondering if maybe sometime youd like to go out and maybe grab some dinner
you mean like a date
i thought you were a fag
no uh im just a transvestite
isnt that the same thing
i like girls
so how bout friday
uncomfortable look you seem like a nice guy ed but youre just not my type
beat but keep in touch
let me know when your movie opens
the phone hangs up
poor ed just stands there forlorn
ed shuffles down the street mr
lonely guy feeling sorry for himself
he glances in a coffee shop and sees a sweet young woman inside
her name is norma mccarty
she wears a bow in her hair mary jane shoes and a fuzzy white angora sweater
eds eyes widen
innocent norma sits by herself eating
is that angora
norma looks up
standing over her is ed smiling
dont you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing
its very expensive
its made from specially bred rabbits that live in the himalayas
what are you an angora wholesaler
no i work in pictures
im a director actor writer producer
she laughs ah cmon
nobody does all that
two people do
orson welles and me
you know youre a very attractive girl
my goodness youre embarrassing me
you shouldnt be embarrassed by the truth
he smoothly sits down mind if i order some hotcakes
criswell and paul drive at night
theyre dressed up
swing music plays on the radio
so whos the surprise for
ed was real mysterious
all hed say was its a surprise party
isnt that like him
beat and isnt that like us that we show up anyway
they pull up to a guard gate
theyre at a studio
were here for the wood party
theyve rented stage
drive straight back
there is another rambunctious party in progress
crepe paper streamers hang down
bela approaches tor
so what are we doing here
but theres a lotta booze
suddenly ed steps into the middle of the room
hes extremely handsome in his tuxedo and beaming happily
could everyone please quiet down
the room quiets first of all i want to thank you all my good friends for being here tonight
and second if youre wondering what the big surprise is
well tonight im getting married
the crowd is stunned
many people drop their glasses
ed proudly pulls out norma
shes in a wedding gown
everybody this is norma theyre bewildered
who the fuck is she
i never heard of her
ed walks over
he hugs bela
and bela i want you to be the best man
bela smiles trying to hide his total confusion
the wedding is in progress
the crowd is seated
a minister performs the ceremony with ed and norma
norma do you promise to love honor and cherish
everybody is quietly gossiping
i didnt even know he had a girlfriend
he taps him on the shoulder i hear shes an actress who gave him money
nah i heard shes his childhood sweetheart from poughkeepsie
i predict its dolores in a mask
the minister is speaking to ed
in sickness and in health till death do you part
he smiles then i now pronounce you man and wife
ed kisses norma
the crowd doesnt applaud
theyre too baffled by this whole event
everyones drinking and dancing
ed proudly introduces norma to his buddies
norma this is bela bela this is norma
norma this is tor tor this is norma
norma this is paul paul this is norma
he cant resist so how long have you known eddie
sweetly since tuesday
criswell grabs ed and pulls him aside
edward are you sure you know what youre doing
it seems a little crazy but sometimes you just know shes perfect for me
outside a car honks
oop thats our cue
to norma honey we gotta go
goodbye ed and norma run out the door
the crowd hurries after them
ed and norma jump into his nash
it says just married and is festooned with dangling tin cans
the car screeches away
the cans rattle noisily then slowly fade into the distance
were at a desert roadside motel the san bernardino arms
a vacancy light flashes
ed excitedly carries norma over the threshold
he throws her onto the bed and they start ardently making out
eddie im just a small town girl
ive never done this before
kissing her dont worry ill teach you
he helps her remove her wedding dress
she is very shy
i dont know anything
ed removes his jacket then gestures to his shirt
norma nervously starts unbuttoning it
ed bites his lip in anticipation
norma opens the shirt
and inside ed is wearing a bra norma is horrified
what the heck is this
honey i have a little secret to share with you
theres a loud womans scream
then the door slams open and norma runs hysterically out clutching her dress about her
stay away from me
ed runs out after her
please be compassionate
im your husband
no youre not
this marriage was never consummated
im getting an annulment
ed drives sadly through the streets alone
his car still says just married and the tin cans rattle behind him
eds car pulls up
ed stumbles out yanks off the tin cans and throws them in someones trash
ed despondently approaches belas
inside a light glows and the dogs bark
ed is relieved
he bangs on the door
bela let me in
bela its eddie
he keeps banging
finally the door opens and bela stands there shakily waving a gun bela is doped up glassy eyed and disturbingly haggard
why are you here
bela whats with the gun
why arent you on your honeymoon
she changed her mind
she doesnt wanna marry me
beat can you put down the gun
bela weakly lowers the gun
ed walks in in a near stupor
needles and drug paraphernalia are scattered about what are you doing
i was thinking about killing myself
jesus christ what an evening
he looks around what happened
near tears eddie i received a letter from the government
theyre cutting off my unemployment
thats all ive got
without it i cant pay the rent
dont you have any savings
i have nothing to live for
tonight i should die
distraught and you should come with me
frail bela points the gun at ed
ed is terrified
buddy i dont know if thats such a good idea
itll be wonderful
well be at peace
in the afterlife you dont have to worry about finding work
bela im on your side
cmon give me the gun
he cautiously steps forward if you give me the gun ill make you a drink
what are you drinking
ed stares in anguish
straight up or on the rocks
bela drops the gun
he starts weeping
ed walks over and hugs the shaking old man
im sorry eddie
im so sorry
everythings gonna be all right
eds car pulls up at the south metropolitan state hospital
its a grim unwelcoming edifice
ed helps weak bela from the car
they look at each other then ed gingerly leads bela in
the lobby is clammy and dim
ed and bela reach the desk
a nurse looks up startled
my goodness you gave me the willies
you look like that dracula guy
very somber my name is bela lugosi
i wish to commit myself
for what reason
i have been a drug addict for twenty years
i need help
the nurse nods
she takes belas arm and leads him away
bela glances at ed then steps through a wide door
as it swings shut we see a doctor walk over and shake belas hand
ed stares at the door dazed by all thats happened
he sits down in a chair exhausted
eds eyes slowly close and he falls asleep
ed is still asleep but now sunlight beats in
ed stirs and wakes up
he groggily looks around and sitting across from him is a woman knitting
this is kathy ohara solid reflective with a dry sense of humor
ed peers at her
beat youre sleeping in a tuxedo
i got married last night
the marriage already ended
ed watches her knit
what are you making
booties for my father
he gets cold in this hospital
how longs he been here
this is my thirteenth pair
he spots the doctor walk by
he runs to the doctor doctor
im with mr
how is he
theres a lot of junk in his system for such an old man
apparently he was addicted to morphine tried to kick it and got re addicted to methadone
will he be okay
well do our best
we are outside belas room
he can be glimpsed inside strapped to the bed and screaming in pain
he is going through painful withdrawal and shakes horribly
ed strides into the hospital wearing different clothes and carrying a box of chocolates
he waves at the nurse
she smiles hi ed
boy hes got a lot of visitors today
ed is puzzled
he hurries back
a crowd of newspaper reporters and photographers overflow belas room
ed is astonished
whats going on here
decrepit bela is propped up in his bed as the mob of reporters throw questions at hit and snap shots bela how long have you been a junkie
bela look this way
ed angrily pushes through
this is a hospital
get out of here
ed forces them out then slams the door
in a hoarse whisper isnt it wonderful
after all these years the press is showing an interest again in bela lugosi
surprised bela theyre parasites
they just want to exploit you
there is no such thing as bad press
a man from new york even said hes putting me on the front page
first celebrity to ever check into rehab
he smiles feebly when i get out of here i will be healthy
i will be primed for my comeback
bela starts coughing heavily
ed stares sadly
ed sits tensely in the lobby holding vigil
kathy ohara walks by
oh its you again
you look beat
hows your father
thank you for asking
pause hows your friend
kathy reaches in her purse and pulls out two black booties
well i made him some booties to cheer him up
beat theyre black to match his cape
ed slowly smiles in response
but this isnt his normal slick smile
would you maybe like to get a coffee
ed and the doctor stand in a doorway talking
we thought mr
lugosi was insured though the screen actors guild
they say his eligibility ran out years ago
look he doesnt have any money
but ill give you everything ive got
i have a few hundred dollars
the doctor shakes his head grimly
that wont even begin to cover it
hes going to have to leave
bela lies sleeping in bed pasty and pale
newspaper clippings of his hospital stay are tacked up
ed anxiously tiptoes in
he quietly speaks
bela wake up
bela stirs lethargically
ed puts on a fake smile
ive got some good news
the doctor says youre all better
you can come home
so weak hes barely audible really
i dont feel so great
no you look good
and the tests came back fine
a poignant pause cmon
ed gingerly helps bela up
bela slowly gets into eds car
eddie i wanna make another picture
when are we gonna make another picture
ed is desperately trying to cut a deal with the old manager
please i just need it for one afternoon
ed if i cut a deal for you i gotta cut one for everybody
this is different
itll mean so much to me
all i need is a camera and a tripod
no lights no sound
and thats it
and one roll of film
the old guy gives ed a tough look
bela is dressed in his sunday finest standing in front of his little house
he wears a cloak and a wide brimmed hat
this is so exciting
out on the lawn
is just ed
with the camera
so eddie dont we need a sound crew
no this is just the second unit
well do the main footage later
so what is the scene about
youre a very important and respected man
youre leaving your house
and youre in a hurry to a big social event
he mulls this over
but what if im not in too big a hurry
what if i take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life
to smell a flower
he smiles thats great
lets do a take
bela goes in the front door
ed gets behind the camera then turns it on
okay roll camera
scene one take one
theres a moment
and then bela slowly steps outside calm dignified walking with a cane
he looks about and then something catches his eye
he leans down and picks a flower
bela smells the flower then abruptly drops it
he starts crying
a pause and then he composes himself
the old man slowly shuffles out of frame
ed peers emotionally from behind the camera
eddie how was i
bela is pleased
beat now what about my close up
eds nash convertible pulls up outside a neat little duplex in a nice neighborhood
ed is dressed up for a date
he checks his hair nervously in the mirror revealing an anxious boyishness weve never seen before
ed carries a bouquet of flowers to the front door
he rings the bell
kathy opens the door
she looks very pretty in a full skirt with a crinolin
i didnt know you were so traditional
a little embarrassed i just picked them up on the way over
theyre very nice
she smiles sweetly let me get my coat
ed and kathy are at a tattered traveling carnival
rattling steel rides and flashing lights spin about them
they stroll through the crowds eating cotton candy
kathy wears one of eds flowers on her dress
so have you always lived in l
im from back east
you know all american small town
everybody knew everybody i was a boy scout my dad worked for the post office
sounds like you lived in grovers corners
ed and kathy ride through the old mechanical spook house
did you find it boring
nah cause i had my comic books
and i read pulp magazines
and i listened to the radio dramas
a wooden witch jumps out at them
they ignore it
i loved those shows
the shadow getting excited yeah
dont forget mercury theatre
and then every saturday id go to the little movie theater down the street
i even started ushering there
a creaky ghost flies overhead
youre not gonna believe the first picture i ever saw
what do you mean
ed freaks out
thats the first picture ever saw
mechanical bats drop down and flap around them
that is incredible
beat you know i had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie
i had to sleep with the lights on for a month
he smiles but i never missed a lugosi picture after that
a few years ago i actually saw him do dracula live
i thought he was much scarier in person
he starts at kathy in wonder
he is overcome
their car smashes through the tin exit doors
ed and kathys little car comes to a stop
he gets very serious
kathy im about to tell you something ive never told any girl on a first date
but i think its important that you know
beat i like to wear womens clothes
i like to wear womens clothes panties brassieres sweaters pumps
its just something i do
and i cant believe im telling you but i really like you and i dont want it getting in the way down the road
kathy is amazed
she contemplates all this
does this mean you dont like sex with girls
i love sex with girls
kathy slyly grins
ed grins back
ed is on the telephone
we split screen with vampira
ed on phone vampira
hi its ed wood
vampira on phone ed i told you i dont wanna go out
no dont worry i moved on
i was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film bride of the monster
confused didnt you just make one called bride of the atom
its the same film
but the distributor wanted a punchier title
its gonna be a big event were going all out
bela tor and cris are coming
youll have fun
vampira rolls her eyes
hundreds of kids and teenagers enter a dilapidated second run theater
a banner says bride of the monster world premiere
celebrities in person
an antique limousine hearse drives down a dingy street
tor ill bela vampira and criswell are crammed in with him along with bewildered kathy
everyone is dressed in gaudy scary outfits
tor wears his frightening white contact lenses
my eyes are killink me
were almost there
still hoarse eddie where are we
we passed that carwash twenty minutes ago
i predict were lost
to bela hey
you wanna watch the hands
bela sheepishly removes his hand from her thigh
he looks around baffled has anyone ever been to downey
the audience is so restless theyre practically rioting
they clap and chant angrily
a fat patronizing manager steps on stage
children if you dont calm down there wont be the entertainment
it was supposed to start an hour ago
tempers are flaring
my eyes are burnink
theres the theater
i cant see nothink
the hearse pulls up
a frantic usher runs over
thank god youre here
theyre tearing the place apart
the gang awkwardly steps out of the hearse
tor gets out and blindly walks straight into a lamp post
bela moves slowly very feeble
vampira smooths out her slinky black dress then puts her arm around bela to help him
criswell points tor in the right direction and the group stumbles in
ed escorts excited kathy
ive never been to a premiere before
the usher opens the auditorium doors
people are screaming and shouting
kids jump up and down on top of the chairs
bela tor vaspira and criswell are alarmed
the lights dim on and off
scratchy spooky music blasts over the sound system
go knock em dead
criswell pushes blind tor towards the stage
tor sticks out his arms and scarily staggers down the aisle
criswell nervously follows
vampira escorts bela
the crowd boos
they pelt our gang with popcorn
tor growls like a monster
kids laugh and jeer
in back ed speaks in a frightening manner into a microphone ed amplified ooooo
at the stroke of midnight the witching hour the ghouls arise from the dead tor slips in some butter
he tumbles and falls
a womans voice cackles
its the blind leading the blind
tor staggers to his feet
all disoriented he starts walking the wrong direction and falls over a chair
criswell quickly helps his up
dis is a nightmare
its show biz
criswell pushes tor in the right direction
some roughnecks knock down criswell and snatch his wallet
a mean boy jumps on his chair ripping the stuffing out of the seat
he throws the fibers in the air and they float over bela and vampira
what is that
i think theyre getting ready to burn this place down
a high school punk runs up and grabs vampiras breasts
hey vampira how bout a little love
she impulsively swings her arm and slams the kid
the manager pleads to the mob
somebody throws a bottle and hits him in the head
he goes down
the lights suddenly go off
some girls scream
he grabs kathy and runs down to his friends
were getting the hell out of here
ed rounds up bela tor criswell and vampira
the crowd boos louder
blind tor is totally confused
what is happening
the group runs up the aisle and leaves
as the doors close bride of the monster starts unspooling on the screen
the gang frantically runs out scared for their lives
they look over
some juvenile delinquents are stripping the hearse
were gonna die
the theater doors crash open
the angry mob pours out
ed spins wildly around
and sees a cab approaching
kathy runs frenziedly into the street and throws herself at the cab
it screeches to a halt
everybody sprints over and jumps in
the cab roars away
all of them are breathing heavily
they watch in the rear window as they drive away from the rampage
a nervous silence
until bela speaks
now that was a premiere
all of them laugh
bela and ed stroll down the street in high spirits
bela smokes a big fat cigar
last night was quite a romp
did you see that kid grab vampiras tits
i envied him
he chuckles hell i envied you too having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that
yeah shes really somethin
i know none of my wives wouldve
bela puffs his cigar
eddie i want to thank you
these last few days have been a good time
i just wish you coulda seen the movie
i know it by heart
bela stops walking
and in a booming theatrical voice he suddenly launches into his impassioned climactic speech from bride of the monster
i have no home
living like an animal the jungle is my home
but i will show the world that i can be its master
i shall perfect my own race of people
a race of atomic supermen that will conquer the world
ed is touched
a few people around them applaud
belas face lights up proud
an awed midwestern tourist hands him a pen and paper
lugosi could i have your autograph
boy that was incredible
youre just as good an actor as you always were
bela puffs out his chest majestically
beat im seventy four but i dont know it
if the brain is young then the spirit is still vigorous
like a young man
bela turns and smiles wanly at ed
ed smiles back
ed and kathy stand in his kitchen making dinner
she sticks her finger in a pot
ed this spaghetti sauce is delicious
its actually the only thing i know how to make
he motions hey can you grab that strainer
she holds a strainer
ed pours the spaghetti over it
suddenly the phone rings
always at the wrong time
he answers the phone hello
and then he gets a very somber expression
ed hangs up the phone
he looks pained
what was that
quiet bela died
its belas funeral
ed sits crying in the front row with kathy at his side
all belas friends are there
theyre very subdued
bela lies inside made up in his full dracula outfit
his hair is died black and he wears the famous cape
on a grassy hill bela is laid to rest
the small crowd of mourners stands silhouetted against the dark gray clouds
the coffin is lowered into the ground
ed stands at the front silently watching
a few tabloid photographers snap pictures
whose crazy idea was it to bury him in the cape
i heard it was in the will
it was how he wanted to be remembered
ed is alone in a darkened screening room depressed
playing on the screen is the last footage of bela bela stumbles around in front of his house and smells the flower
ed drinks out of a flask
the film runs out
a voice comes over a loudspeaker
do you want me to run it again
ed silently nods
eds apartment has gone to hell
ed is in a robe unshaven and clutching a bottle of whiskey
newspapers are everywhere
belas and eds dogs eat out of the trash
kathy tries to straighten things up
ed stares listlessly
id seen him in a coffin so many times i expected him to jump out
ed youve got to snap out of this
belas dead youre not i might as well be
i made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see
beat i blew it
all he wanted was a comeback
that last glory
well you tried angry i was a fuckin hack
i let people recut the movies cast their relatives
beat i let bela down
a new studebaker pulls up
a bumper sticker says jesus saves a man in a plain brown suit steps out
this is j
edward reynolds eds santironious southern christian landlord
reynolds assertively bangs on eds front door
wood this is mr
reynolds your landlord
could you please open up
the door opens a crack
bleary ed peers out
wood you have bounced your third and final rent check
he sloppily lies im real sorry
my stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account
cmon in ill write you another one
ed motions reynolds in
reynolds peers unsurely at the tornado inside
then he notices a framed one sheet for bride of the monster
reynolds admires it
hmm so youre in the picture business
rummaging for a check you could say that im interested in the picture business
my associates and i wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films on the apostles
but unfortunately we dont have enough money
distracted raising money is tough
our church has the money for one film
we just dont have it for all twelve
his eyes suddenly pop
the color comes back to his fact
a plan is quickly boiling over inside eds head
he starts feverishly pacing around
okay you know what you do
you produce a film in a commercially proven genre
and after its a hit you take the profits from that and make the twelve apostles movies
would that work
you see this script
ed randomly grabs a script off the messy floor then glances down to see which one he picked up
it says graverobbers from outer space
graverobbers from outer space
its money in the bank graverobbers from what from outer space
its science fiction
very big with the kids
if you make this picture youll have enough money to finance a hundred religious films
beat and pay my back rent from the profits
reynolds scratches his head
i dont know
this is all a lot to absorb
its a guaranteed blockbuster
um i understand that this science friction is popular but dont the big hits always have big stars
in a frenzy yeah well weve got a big star
mystified lugosi didnt be pass on
ed grins maniacally
he grabs a small reel of mm film
yes but ive got the last footage he ever shot
just it doesnt look like very much
its the acorn that will grow a great oak
ill just find a double to finish his scenes and well release it as bela lugosis final film a beat
reynolds stares intrigued
the place is cleaned up
ed shouts excitedly into the phone
were making another film
yeah i got the baptist church of beverly hills to put up the cash
paul sticks his head in
ed i got the lugosi lookalikes outside
bring em in
bunny i gotta run
ed hangs up
paul leads in three
they look nothing like bela
one is a homeless bum one is a short fat man and one is chinese
ed inspects them
he glances at the chinese guy and this guy doesnt work at all
well i was thinkin like when bela played fu manchu
that was karloff
beat paul you gotta try harder
i dont want this film to be haif assed
this time we go for the quality
paul turns to go
and by the way keep sunday free
the producers want all of us to get baptized
kathy reads a newspaper while knitting an angora sweater
ed is typing deliriously fast in one of his artistic fevers
you know when you rewrite a script it just gets better and better
do you want your buttons on the left or the right
its more natural
he squints at his script hey ive got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb
what would that be made of
uh atomic energy
theyre beyond that
theyre smarter than the humans
whats more advanced
dynamite no bigger
whats the biggest energy
oh thats gonna seem so scientific
he resumes typing this movies gonna be the ultimate ed wood film
no compromises kathy suddenly jumps up shocked
oh my god
look at this
she runs over and shows ed the newspaper
a small headline says vampira revealed to be red
underneath is the story channel has fired popular horror hostess vampira after learning of her suspected communist leanings
the poor girls out of a job
he looks up i should give her a call
ed and kathy sit with a shaken up vampira
im really sorry
people wont even return my calls
its like i dont exist
i know what thats like
he pulls out his script anyway i brought a copy of the script
you would play the ghouls wife
she grimaces the ghouls wife god i cant believe im doing this
you should feel lucky
eds the only guy in town who doesnt pass judgment on people
he laughs hell if i did i wouldnt have any friends
vampira smiles uncomfortably
would it be possible to make the ghouls wife a little less prominent so people wont really notice me in the movie
you dont wanna be noticed
hey how bout this what if i dont have any lines
ill do the part mute
kathy suddenly sees someone
look its dr
she shouts hey dr
tom mason a tall slender year old chiropractor strides over
kathy how are you
youre looking in alignment today
actually my necks a little funny
mason grabs kathys neck and cracks it loudly
ed stares at the doctor in astonishment
ed is riveted
wait a second
ed excitedly jumps up takes his napxin and covers the doctors face from the nose down
its uncanny whats uncanny
services are in progress
edward reynolds leads a choir singing an emotional spiritual
ed tor criswell paul conrad vampira kathy bunny and dr
tom mason sit in back
theyre all wearing white robes and arguing about the doctor
he look nutink like bela
hes kinds got his ears
no cover up his face
kathy lifts dr
masons robe over his bewildered face
now i see it
goofily imitating bela i want to suck your blood
everybody cracks up
ed waves his arms
we want these baptists to like us
like bad kids they quiet down
ingenuous southern reverend lyn lemon speaks up front
brothers and sisters weve reached a special part of the service
the baptism of our new members
beat if the congregation will oblige wed like to adjourn and reconvene at emma duboiss back yard
the straight laced devout congregation is gathered around a large swimming pool
reverend lemon reynolds and our misfits stand in the shallow end in their white robes
criswell whispers to vampira
why couldnt we do this in the church
because brother tori couldnt fit in the sacred tub
do you accept the lord jesus christ as your savior
reynolds dunks ed in the water
do you reject satan and all his works
hiding a smirk i do
reynolds dunks bunny
do you repent for all your sins
tor winks slyly at criswell
reynolds dunks tor
but tor slips from reynolds grasp and sinks to the bottom of the pool
oh my god i dropped him tor lies on the bottom staring lifeinsly
mischievous i dont think hes coming up
the mans drowning
scared what do we do
the whole congregation starts jumping in
men and women in their sunday finest leap into the pool and start tugging on tor
but nobody can budge the big whale
near tears dear jesus please forgive us
he suddenly rises poseidon like from the pool
tor spits out water then lets out a hearty belly lavgh
tor make good joke
the baptists arent amused
a bus drives along
every passenger stares at something up front vampira in her slinky black outfit she reads a grave robbers from outer space script
the bus stops in a scary run down neighborhood
vampira off and warily looks around
this cant be the right address
she nervously walks down a dingy alley
vampira gets to an unmarked grimy door gulps then slowly opens it
and inside is the grave robbers from outer space famous cemetery set
the film is in production
packed into a stinking little studio are a few scrawny twigs branches and flimsy cardboard tombstones set against a black drop
tot struts about gregariously in his inspector clay suit
he chats up the crew
i am so happy
finally i am star wit dialogue i memorized every wordt
eddie will be so proud
the baptists chase ed around
they wave the script
before we start shooting mr
wood we have a few questions the script refers on numerous occasions to graverobbing
now we find the concept of digging up consecrated ground highly offensive
very annoyed what are you talking about
its the premise of the movie
its even the title for christs sake
yes about that title it strikes us as very inflammatory
why dont we change it to plan nine from outer space
ed shakes his head
theyre filming the cops arriving at the pitch black cemetery
theres a prop police car and an assistant blows fog in
tor steps onto the set tor as inspector clay medicul eksaminer been aroundt yet
the morgue wagon oughta be along most any time
you get statement frumk vitnesses
yeah but theyre pretty scared
findink mess like dis oughta make anyone frightened
have one of da boyz take dem back to town
you take jarge
everybody grices trying to understand tor
the script girl shakes her head
the baptists angrily pull ed aside
whatd you give him all the lines for
look lugosi is dead and vampira wont talk
ihad to give somebody the dialogue
thats not an answer
as inspector clay tor wanders around the cemtery waving his flashlight and nervously fingering his gun
ed grins at the baptists
see no talking
isnt he good
he grabs his megaphone dr
the door of a large paper mache crypt creeps open
tom uncertainly steps out impersonating bela
he holds the cape over his face and stalks tor
ed is pleased as punch
he whispers to the baptists
isnt it wonderful
doesnt this strike you as a bit morbid
no he wouldve loved it
belas returned from the grave like dracula
he grabs the megaphone vampira steps out walking in a trance
tor is now cornered
he fruitlessly fires his gun but bullets cant stop zombies
vampira and dr
tom kill him
paul and conrad are scared cops exploring the cemetery
conrad as a cop lets go down and find out whose grave it is
paul marco as a cop why do i always get hooked up with these spook details
off stage a grip on a ladder pans a k searchlight
the light crosses the actors
they look up in horror then clumsily fall down
a rickety fake tombstone tips over
freaking out perfect
wood do you know anything about the art of film production
i like to think so
that cardboard headstone tipped over
this graveyard is obviously phony
people wont notice
filmmaking isnt about picky details its about the big picture
oh you wanna talk about the big picture
how bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight but now its suddenly night
ed suddenly flips out
you dont know anything
havent you ever heard of suspension of disbelief
a strapping young man walks up
he smiles at the baptists reverend im here
baffled whos he this is our choir director
hes gonna play the young hero
furious are you in ane
im the director
make the casting decisions around here
i thought this was a group effort
ed spastically storms away
ed bursts in
he paces about hysterically traumatized
theyre driving me crazy
these baptists are stupid stupid stupid
ed glances at a clothing rack and sees an angora sweater
ed is taken aback
he slowly removes it from the hanger and rubs it against his face
his breathing slows
i need to calm
take deep breaths
he rubs the angora ohh its so smooth
the dressing room door flies open
ed slowly struts out in the sweater pantsuit and pumps he is calmed and at ease
the stage quiets
people are staring
lets set up for scene
move the crypt stage left and get ready with tors make up effect
the crew resumes working
but the baptists charge up aghast
what do you think youre doing im directing
not like that youre not
remove that get up immediately
you shame our lord
ed throws up his hands
i give up
ed frantically marches out of the building
hes still in his ladies outfit
ed sees a cab and whistles loudly
the cab pulls over
ed jumps in
take me to the nearest bar
the place is quiet mid morning
frazzled ed enters and sits at the bar
imperial whiskey straight up
the bartender nonchalantly pours a shot
ed takes the drink
he quietly sips his booze and reflects upon his day
ed glances around
and then suddenly his eyes widen
sitting at a table is orson welles
the portly world famous filmmaker sits alone eating lunch with one hand and drawing storyboards with the other
ed is thunderstruck
oh my god
its orson welles
ed nervously stands
he starts to step forward when he catches his own reflection in a mirror
hes still in drag
ed rolls his eyes
he runs his hand through his hair then slowly approaches orson welles
ed is terrified
excuse me sir
he casually looks up yes
uh uh im a young filmmaker and a really big fan
and i just wanted to meet you
he extends his hand my pleasure
im orson welles
um im ed wood
he smiles anxiously so what are you working on now
eh the financing just fell through for the third time on don quixote
so im trying to finish a promo for something else
but i cant find the soundtrack he shrugs i think i left it in malta
ed is astonished
i cant believe it
these sound like my problems
its the damn money men
you never know whos a windbag and whos got the goods
and then they all think theyre a director
aint that the truth
ive even bad producers recut my movies ugh i hate when that happens
on a roll and they always want to cast their buddies it doesnt even matter if theyre right for the part
tell me about it
im supposed to do a thriller at universal and they want charlton heston to play a mexican ed shakes his head
welles is it all worth it
it is when it works
solemn you know the one film of mine i can stand to watch
the studio hated it
but they didnt get to touch a frame
he smiles warmly ed visions are worth fighting for
why spend your life making someone elses dreams
he has seen god
ed bursts onto the stage a changed man
re energized he confidently grabs the baptists
we are gonna finish this film just the way i want it because you cant compromise an artists vision
flustered b but its our money and youre gonna make a bundle
this movies gonna be famous
but only if you shut up and let me do it my way
reynolds and rev
lemon are speechiess
he beams turns and shouts triumphantly into the soundstage
tor plays a zombie rising from the dead
he wears the scary white contact lenses
tors so big he has trouble lifting himself from the grave
ed and his stock footage buddy watch a moviola
okay i want that tank
and i want that bomb
harry paints bunnys face green like a martian
the aliens should look like people
im tellin ya aliens are always green
not in my movie theyre not
bunnys make up is now normal
he wears an alien suit
a hammy alien enters and salutes with a bizarre crossing gesture
what plan will we follow
he consults his papers ah yes
plan nine deals with the resurrection of the dead
tor staggers up to paul marco and clobbers him
ed smiles at the baptists
maybe you guys were right
plan nine is a good title
ed shoots the famous flying saucers
paul holds a paper plate and conrad lights it on fire
the saucer soars on fishing line over a little miniature town
tom glides in his cape over his face
a woman screams
ed stands in front of a masonite board and two chairs
an actor playing the airplane pilot walks up
wheres the cockpit set
youre standing in it
he yells off alright bring in the shower curtain
a shower curtain gets lowered into the doorway
a car zooms by
kathy drives as ed shoots handheld out the back window
th hammy alien argues with the humans
so what if we develop this solarnite bomb
wed be even a stronger nation
your stupid minds
thats all im taking from you
he whacks the alien
a brawl breaks out
criswell lectures behind a desk with mysterious lighting perhaps on your way home someone will pass you in the dark and you will never know it
for they will be from outer space
the famous shot tor and vampira walk in a trance through foggy cemetery
off stage ed stands with the crew
he shouts gleefully
he beams and cut
its a wrap
its pouring rain
standing in the drench is ed
hes wearing a tux and fighting with his open convertible top
the rambler is filled with water
kathy stands under an awning
she wears a pretty gown
i cant get it to go up
ed youre gonna miss your own premiere
he gives up cmon
lets just go
ed impulsively opens the car door
water pours out
kathy scurries out and jumps in the wet car with him
the rain is gushing down
the marquee proclaims world people hurry in
ed and kathy roar up in the open convertible totally soaked
he jumps out opens her door and they run inside
the theater is packed
all the gang and their friends and families are gathered
criswell stands on stage speaking into a mike
you are about to see en extraordinary motion picture
but before it begins i think we ought to give a hand to the man without whom we wouldnt be here tonight
eddie take a bow
the crowd erupts in applause
everybody goes crazy even the baptists
people yell speech
ed smiles proudly
kathy kisses him
ed runs down front hugs criswell then takes the microphone
thanks a million
i just wanna say
this film is for bela
the lights dim
the title plan from outer space is projected onto the screen
as random images from the film play out we drift over the happy faces of our friends watching
paul and conrad stare enthralled
tor laughs as he sees himself
bunny nudges her playfully
criswell mouths his own lines
bela appears in his little suit
in the last footage he ever shot he shuffles around in front of his house then tenderly smells the flower
he watches entranced
then he smiles to himself
this is the one
i know ill be remembered for this film
the boisterous crowd is in high spirits
people congratulate ed and pat him on the back
it was great
its your best one yet
bela wouldve loved it
ed drifts through the crowd basking in the glory
its like a wonderful dream
the rain comes down in sheets
the doors burst open and ed and kathy run out
ed im so happy for you
lets get married
right now lets drive to vegas
but its pouring
and the car top is stuck
he gives his killer grin so
its only a five hour drive
and itll probably clear up once we hit the desert
heck itll probably clear up once we drive around the corner
kathy stares in disbelief
then she smiles
ed and kathy jump into the open convertible
the engine starts and they drive away disappearing into the pouring rain
and then we move up up into the black clouds
lightning cracks across the sky
we slowly pull out from the sky move through a window
and were back inside criswell is sitting inside his coffin
he stares at us
my friend you have just seen the story of edward d
stranger than fact
and yet every incident based on sworn testimony
his eyes gleam a man
can you prove it didnt happen
a beat to ponder this
and then criswell slowly lies back in his coffin and the lid mysteriously closes over him
