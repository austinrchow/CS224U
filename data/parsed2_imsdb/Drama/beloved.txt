written by richard lagravenese based on the novel by toni morrison october it is winter in ohio
a house sits isolated beside a barren field
the field stretches beyond until a line of distant woods stops it
around the back of the house stands a rundown storage shed a cold house a privy and a water pump
a porch with a single door serves as the only entrance
camera begins a slow move toward the house as we we hear sounds from inside the house bumps a chair falling over
and feet running on wooden floor boards
old and howard yrs
old run down the steps from the second floor
they are fully dressed carrying a small bag of belongings
we gonna need food
bulgar reluctantly lets go of howards hand as the latter runs into the kitchen
alone he edges towards the front door when suddenly the door slowly creaks open on its own
scared he steps away slowly
howard is trying to toss some food into a bag
he spots a cake sitting on top the wooden table with some pieces already eaten
he finds a knife and approaches the table
he is about to cut into the cake when he sees two tiny hand prints appear on the cakes surface
howard stops cold dropping the knife
howard exits the kitchen and takes bulgars hand come on
the boys look up the stairs and see their baby sister nine year old denver
where you goin
the brothers are brokenhearted at the sight of her
they love their sister
but there are stronger forces here
a mirror on a wall beside howard cracks down the middle
we gotta go
bulgar looks up to denver
they exchange a look of deep affection and pained longing
he wants to take her
you take care
bulgar is starting to cry
he rushes up the steps and hugs his sister
he kisses her hard then breaks away
denvers outstretched hand misses his shirt and hangs mid air
bulgar flies down the steps and disappears out of the house holding howards hand once more
denver sits alone at the top of the stairs
she sadly looks up and weeps as if to the house itself now what you go and do that for
the voice of sethe humming a melody carries over the images of the two boys running for their lives towards the train holding hands all the way
howard is the first to reach it
as it passes by he throws his bag upon it and jumps in
bulgar races beside it as howard reaches for him
howards hand reaching for bulgars
wide shot the boys are on the train as it leaves town
on its route the train passes a ramshackle graveyard
camera moves slowly into the graveyard until it reaches a headstone made with flecked pink stone
upon the headstone is only one word camera moves slowly towards the side exterior of into a close up of a woman looking out of a second floor bedroom window
it is sethe mother of the two boys and denver
she hums her melody softly sadly with a resigned understanding of why her boys are running away
and a deep pain that is too constant to notice
baby suggs grandmother and mother in law to sethe sits in her bed fondling colored fabric of bright green
it is the only vibrant color in an otherwise drab surrounding
suggs is bed ridden exhausted to her bones her face a mosaic of suffering and sacrifice and tested faith
ya know what id love to see
i loved to see me some lavender
you got any lavender
or even pink pinkll do
sethe is placing folded laundry into a dresser
she stops and checks her pockets for rags or swatches
she looks around the room
ah winter in ohio is especially rough if youve got an appetite for color
suggs goes back to contemplating her green until oh wait
suggs looks up to see sethe sticking her pink tongue out at her
oh thats fine
sethe lets out a small laugh
she walks toward the window stretching her body
her expression changes as she thinks of her boys
baby suggs reads her like a book
theyll be all right
im surprised they lasted here this long
i dont know
maybe we should have moved
whatd be the point
not a house in the country aint packed to the rafters with some dead negros grief
we lucky our ghost is a baby
my husband spirit come back
dont talk to me
you got one child left still pullin at your skirts
i had eight
eight with six fathers
every one of them gone from me
four taken four chased and all i expect worrying somebodys house into evil
my first born alls i can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread
her little hands
i wouldnt knowem if they slapped me
can you beat that
eight children and thats all i remember
returning to her work you remember halle
oh i remember bits and pieces of all ofem i guess
halle of course
i had halle a lifetime
almost twenty years
my two girls sold and gone before i could even a heard about it and them without their grown up teeth yet
my third child my son after halle
i let that straw boss have me for four months sos i could keep that boy
next year he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child
i couldnt love that child
not any of the rest either
god take what he would
and he did
the boys wouldnt have left if halle were here
those boys didnt even know him
you had six whole years of marriage to my halle fathered every one of your children
i learned hard that a mans just a man but a son like that
now thats somebody
sethes mixed feelings show all over her face
although she loved halle there is clearly something unresolved in her
just got a few more things to do then ill start supper
denver is playing in the front yard by herself
sethe is pumping water into a bucket for clothes washing
a gentle breeze carries a leaf into the bucket
sethe sees it floating atop the water for a moment then picks it up
of sethe as the image triggers a feeling and the feeling a memory from long ago
sethe looks around her and finds she is no longer standing in the barren field of
but rather a stunning vista of the plantation sweet home sun beating down on groves and rows of gorgeous sycamores for as far as the eye can see
sethes figure dwarfed by the majestic landscape
sethe looks frightened
her breathing grows shallow
she hears something the sound of a wagons wheels rolling over a road growing louder coming towards her sethe turns away from the sycamores towards the road to see a
man driving a horse and wagon with two children in the back coming up bluestone road
he wears no hat
sethe breathes easily
she looks around her the reality of s barren field has returned
the memory of sweet homes sycamores have vanished
denver is playing near the road
as the wagon nears denver looks up and smiles
the man whips the horse hard so as to ride past the house faster
the children stare at denver and with horror and curiosity
the stares of the children destroy denvers smile
she watches them go then turns to hide her upset and sees her mother watching her
sethe looks to denver with empathy and impotence wanting to ease her daughters pain and knowing full well she cannot
hurt and angry denver runs past sethe towards the woods
denver runs with a purpose knowing exactly where she is going
she reaches five boxwood bushes planted in a ring
the tall bushes stretch toward each other four feet off the ground forming a round emerald room in the center seven feet high with walls fifty inches thick of murmuring
this is denvers private place
she bends low and crawls through the leaves into the center
once there this lonely child wipes away her tears and tries to pull herself together
she lays her face against the cool earth
denver walks to her room in her night dress
she passes the opened door of her mothers bedroom and peeks in sethe kneeling by her bed as if praying
beside sethe a white dress kneels as well with its sleeve around sethes waist
like two friendly grown up women comforting each other in prayer
denver tip toes away
sethe enters to check on denver whom she thinks is asleep
she leans over and kisses her forehead only to discover she is awake mama
what is it baby
you think maybe when daddy comes he could talk to the baby ghost
maybe make her behave and then people wont be scared of here no more
i dont know
why wont she ever settle
shes mad like a baby gets mad
you forgetting how little it is
she wasnt even two years old when she died
too little to understand
for a baby she throws a powerful spell
no more powerful than the way i loved her
hearing her mother say this moves denver
what do you pray for mama
oh i dont really pray anymore
i just talk
oh about time
how some things go
some things just stay
like the place i was at before here sweet home
even if that whole farm and every tree and blade of grass on it died itll still be there
and if you go and stand in the place where it was what happened there once will happen again
if its still there waiting that mean nothing ever dies
nothing ever does
thats why i had to get my children out
no matter what
thats why you can never go there
you never tell me all what happened
just that they whipped you and you run off pregnant with me
you dont need to know nothing else
nods i saw a white dress kneeling next to you when you was praying
maybe it was my bedding dress
describe it to me
had a high neck
whole mess of buttons coming down the back
well thats not my bedding dress
i never had a button on nothing
a bunch at the back
on the sit down part
i dont know what its called
you say it was holding on to me
kneeling next to you while you were praying
i mean talking
it looked just like you
well ill be
i think it was a sign
i think maybe babys got plans
i dont know but that dress holding onto you got to mean something
maybe it does
sethe smiles sympathetically for her lonely child
they hear a sound in the house floor boards creaking
shes crawling again
sethe nods and holds her daughters hand as they listen
paul stands on the road gazing up at the house
grateful hes arrived cautious about what hell find he steps towards the porch
his clothes are ragged
his feet sore and blistering in his shoes
off to the side of the house sethe washes her feet and legs at the pump
she looks up and sees pauls figure walking towards the house
the sun blazes in her eyes
she cant make out who it is or whether or not hes even real
as he reaches the porch paul disappears from view
sethe walks towards the front of the house
when she is little more than forty feet away she stops still not certain paul is a real man or an hallucination of the past
is that you
smiles whats left
he rises how you been girl besides barefoot
sethe jams her balled up stockings into her pocket
she smiles like a little girl not able to believe her eyes
you looking good
he lets me look good long as i feel bad
how long has it been
bout eighteen years i figure
and i swear i been walking every one of them
mind if i join you
he begins taking off his shoes
you want to soak them
let me get you some water
no uh uh
cant baby feet
a whole more tramping they got to do yet
youre not leaving right away are you
you stay awhile
well long enough to see baby suggs you
where is she
eight years now
was it hard
i hope she didnt die hard
soft as cream
being alive was the hard part
sorry you missed her though
is that what you came by for
thats some of what i came for
the rest is you
sethe doesnt know what to do with her eyes when he says this
she looks away instinctively
paul realizes that may have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs the truth be known i go anywhere these days
anywhere they let me sit down
come on inside
porch is fine
cool out here
sit with me
like a nervous little girl sethe takes a sit beside a man for the first time in years folding her sweat stained skirt beneath her
so baby suggs is gone
somehow never thought death would find her
it finds everyone
we managed well enough without meeting it
sethe tries to find the words to a difficult question but one that is foremost in her mind i wouldnt have to ask about him would i
youd tell me if there was anything to tell wouldnt you
paul knows instantly she is asking about halle
you know i would
but i dont know any more about what happened to halle now than i did then
something about pauls expression might suggest hes keeping something from her
he turns his gaze outward as he says you must think hes still alive
i think hes dead
its just not being sure that keeps him alive
what did baby suggs think
ha listen to her all her children dead and she felt each one go the very day and hour it happened
when she say halle went
same day my baby was born
you had that baby did you
damn never thought youd make it
running off pregnant
couldnt be no waiting
all by yourself too
a white girl helped me
then she helped herself god bless her
we got spare rooms
you could stay the night if you had a mind to
you dont sound too steady in the offer
its truly meant
i just hope youll pardon my house
paul smiles a warm touched smile that after all that theyve survived sethe is worried about what hell think of her home
i like the sound of that
sethe smiles then rises to escort him in
sethe opens the front door and enters with paul behind her hanging his shoes by the laces over his shoulder
as he follows her in a pool of red undulating light forms around him
it worries him
you got company
on and off
the light undulates faster and faster extending all the way to the kitchen at the end of the hall
frightened paul steps back out the door
what kind of evil you got in there
its not evil
just step through
sethe reaches out her hand
paul tentatively takes it and is lead through the red light of the hallway through to the kitchen where it ends
as he walks through we can see paul affected by the light
it is sad
a sadness that touches him welling up inside until tears are brimming in his eyes
he reaches the normal light of the kitchen and steps out of it
paul turns back to find the red light in the hall is gone
i thought you said she died soft as cream
busying herself in kitchen oh thats not baby suggs
thats my daughter
the one i sent ahead with the boys before i run off
she didnt live
the boys too
no they alive they run off before baby suggs died
the one i was carrying when i left sweet home is all i got left
still affected by the light paul eases himself down at the table finding something to say
well probably best
if a negro boy got legs he ought to use them
sit down too long somebody figure out a way to tie them up
the image disturbs sethe you by yourself then
me and denver
sethe shakes head no and thats all right by you
its all right by me
i cook at a restaurant in town
sew a little on the sly
she places a bottle and a glass on the table before him
the light jarred him
he snatches the bottle to drink and calm himself down
you look more done in by a walk through my front hall than all those eighteen years of walking put together
got that right
denver all of eighteen years old now and beautiful is buttoning up her dress when she hears the voice of a man down in the kitchen
her face lights up
she runs down the white staircase
as denver runs into the kitchen we hear wont you stay a little while
cant nobody catch up on eighteen years in a day
denver appears expectantly down the white staircase that leads from the second floor
she looks at paul wide eyed
they turn to her with gentle smiles baby this heres paul d
paul this is my denver
pauls the last of the sweet home men
denvers heart sinks
good morning miss denver
its a pleasure
good morning mr
glad to get a look at you
last time i saw your mama you were pushing out the front of her dress
shes a fine looking young lady sethe
got her daddys sweet face
you knew my father
knew him well
of course he did
i told you hes from sweet home
paul may stay with us a while
wont that be nice having an old friend stay a spell
but denver reacts with surprise and dismay
paul is not her friend
paul right now is more of an intruder
if thats all right with you that is
we have a ghost here you know
but sad your mama said
no sir not evil
but not sad either
i dont see how it could be lonely spending every minute with us like it does
its my sister
she was just a baby when she died in this house
reminds me of that headless bride back behind sweet home
remember that sethe
used to roam them woods regular
annoyed resentful mama doesnt like talk about sweet home
says it was never sweet and it sure wasnt home
girl mind yourself
now now she got it right there sethe
but its where we were
its where i met your father
and it comes back on us whether we want it to or not
then why dont you ever tell me about it
sethe pauses unnerved and irritated by denvers challenge
denver start up the stove
paul must be hungry
dont go to no trouble on my account
breads no trouble
the rest i brought back from where i work
least i can do cooking dawn to noon is bring dinner home
you got any objections to pike
if he dont object to me i dont object to him
he addresses his humor to denver who offers no response
she crosses to the stove and works on lighting it
wheres he going to sleep
baby suggs room got no sheets or nothing
well figure it out
maybe you should stay with mama mr
then you two can talk about sweet home all night long
explodes whats the matter with you
i never knew you to behave like this
leave her be sethe
im a stranger to her
thats just it
she got no cause to act up with a stranger
denver collapses where she stands sobbing out loud
sethe moves to her
baby what is it
did something happen
denver moves away
sethe registers this rejection
i cant no more
i cant no more
what cant you
i cant live here
i dont know where to go or what to do but i cant live here
nobody speaks to us
nobody comes by
nobody even knows im alive
what she talking about nobody speaks to you
its the house
its not the house
leave off sethe
its hard for a young girl living in a haunted place
that cant be easy
growing irritated its easier than some other things
come here baby
denver allows herself to be held
im a grown man with nothing new left to see or do and im telling you it aint easy
maybe you oughta move
its all right the way it is
you going to tell me its all right with this child half out of her mind
holding denver in her arms i got a tree on my back and a haunt in my house and nothing in between but the daughter im holding in my arms
no more running from nothing
i will never run from another thing on this earth you hear
i took one journey and i paid the ticket but let me tell you something paul d
garner it cost too much
do you hear me
it cost too much
now sit down and eat with us or leave us be
sethes sudden outburst startles paul
he watches as sethe ushers denver out to the keeping room off the kitchen to quiet her down
alone paul is disturbed by sethes words
he fishes out a pouch of tobacco and concentrates on it searching for smoking papers he knows he doesnt have
waiting for sethe to return
when she does she heads straight for the stove
she spits on her finger and touches it to check its heat
she then begins to make bread from flour soda and salt keeping her back to paul throughout as the scene continues what tree sethe
what tree on your back
i dont see nothing growing on your back
its there all the same
who told you that
thats what she called it
i never seen it and never will
but she said thats what it looked like
a chokecherry tree
that was years ago
could have cherries by now for all i know
i dont follow
something in her decides to tell paul d although she keeps working on the bread to stay in control i had milk see
i was pregnant with denver but i had milk for my baby girl that i sent ahead with the boys
i hadnt stopped nursing her when i sent her and the boys ahead of me
anybody could smell me long before they saw me
nothing i could do about it
all i knew is i had to get my milk to my little girl
nobody was going to nurse her like me
nobody was going to get it to her fast enough or take it away when she had enough
nobody knew she couldnt pass her air if you held her up on your shoulder only if she was lying on your knee
nobody knew that but me
paul listens half dreading where he thinks this storys going
we was talking about a tree sethe
sethe works faster
it is the work taking an action any action that allows her tell the story numbly without the pain of reliving it
without the images attacking schoolteachers boys drag me into the barn and took my milk
yet the images come anyway
intercut flashes of memory attack as sethe tells her sethe being raped beaten held down by schoolteachers boys in a barn with a loft
held me down in that barn and took it
sethe screams and is smacked across the face
they were like boulders on me
their hands over my mouth and on my shoulders and my legs
one of the boys holds her face and mouth and head as the two others hold down her body and ravage her
i couldnt move
alls i could see was the loft above their heads
her mouth covered her head immobile she stares up at the loft
sethe squeezes her eyes to erase the image and works harder on the biscuit dough
the flashes of images stop
i told mrs
garner on them
she had that lump on her neck and couldnt speak but her eyes rolled out tears i remember
them boys found out i told on em and schoolteacher made one open up my back and when it closed it made a tree
they used cowhide on you
and they took my milk
they beat you and you was pregnant
and they took my milk
sethe has separated the dough into biscuits which she slips into the stove
as she rises paul steps gently behind her
he slowly caresses her breasts from behind pressing his cheek against her back
he rubs his cheek against it feeling the scars beneath the dress
raising his fingers to the hooks as sethe cries silently he undoes her dress which slips down to her hips exposing the sculpture her back has become
aw lord girl
grateful to have her body be someone elses responsibility for the moment sethe closes her eyes as paul touches every ridge and leaf of her tree with his mouth
the tenderness is almost unbearable
suddenly pauls legs begin trembling
he pauses and looks down
he realizes it is not his legs that tremble but rather the house from side to side
sethe slides to the floor struggling with her dress
on all fours denver crawls in from the keeping room as if trying to keep the house together
paul falling reaching for an anchor begins to shout god damn it
leave this place alone
get the hell outta here
a table rushes at him but paul grabs its leg
managing to stand at an angle as the house continues to pitch he holds the table by two legs and bashes it about wrecking everything screaming at the house the
quaking slows to an occasional lurch but paul does not stop whipping the table around until everything it is absolutely still
he leans against the wall panting
sethe is crouched by the stove
a mixed expression of relief and guilt the expression of a mother whose disobedient child has been sent away
but a child she loves nonetheless
denver looks frightened
more alone than ever now that her one companion is gone
all three are breathing together as if to the same beat like one tired person
denver walks through the broken furniture and dishes
at the stove she ashes over the fire and pulls the pan of biscuits from the oven a shirtless paul d
is by the water pump washing himself
denver lifts the fallen jelly cupboard its contents laying in a heap in the corner of the bottom shelf
she takes out a jar
she looks for a plate and finds half of one by the broken table
she picks it up as she hears paul enter through the front door
sethe prepares a bed for paul
baby suggs quilt is on the bed
she hesitates whether or not to leave it there
paul stands by the door with his shoes in his bands his shirt hanging open down the front
sethe is surprised to see him there she feels awkward
why dont you
take a rest
ill call you when were ready
sure you dont want me to help clean up
youd just get in my way
denver and mell do it
they stand in silence looking at each other for a moment
the awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny
paul starts smiling
sethe covers her mouth to conceal it
and then just as quickly the urge to laugh subsides and the fear they feel takes its place
paul slowly closes the door and places his shoes on the floor
sethe watches him
paul crosses to her
he moves in to kiss her
they approach each others lips like two burn victims trying desperately not to hurt the other with their touch
denver sits on the porch steps alone once again
miserably eating the biscuit and jelly off of a half broken plate
sethe and paul lay in bed after lovemaking
they are still fully clothed
the lovemaking was fast and finished quickly
now there is an awkwardness that is without humor or excitement but sits like a chasm between them
as sethe lays there she remembers a brilliant bright yellow and green corn stalks in a tiny corn field
sethe and a slightly older halle handsome strong run through the field until halle stops them at an isolated spot
out in the open
look around can you see anybody
sethe looks and can see nothing through the corn stalks
she shakes her head no
then nothing can see us neither
he takes off his shirt
seethe giggles as she gets on the ground keeping her ankles crossed
halle lays her back and gently separates her legs
halle pauses before laying on top of her
you are a beautiful sight
dont talk stupid
youre my wife now
i can talk as stupid as i like about you
she giggles i aint never loved nothing like you before sethe
sethe is moved and after i get mama out
then i get us out too
and youll see baby girl
smiles were gonna have us a liiife
he sings the word life so that sethe laughs
then halle lowers himself slowly to her and they begin to make love
as camera pans up to a hill above the field we hear sethe ask you sure nobody can see
we hear halle grunt uh huh as we arrive on the hill where a great tree sits
beneath the tree paul d sixo and pauls brothers paul a
and paul p
are pouring water over heads and watching pov unbeknownst to halle and sethe their lovemaking is in clear view to anyone on the hill
i dont get why she picked him
halles got that way about him
that way a woman feels hes doing it all for her not for himself at all
i cant see nothing so special about halle
what about what hes doing for his mama
fool thing if you ask me
by the time he buys it freedom wont mean a thing to somebody that old and worn
freedom mean something anytime it come
the men watch the corn stalks swaying to the lovemaking
a young paul d
in particular watches with tender yearning
garner the man who owns and runs sweet home
he offers cooked corn to the men
raccoon mustve got into my corn
damaged a few so no use throwing them out
the men looks to each other suppressing a laugh
sethe get the butter there
everyone looks at each other as they thank no
garner and begin to smear butter on their corn and eat
a neighboring farmer visiting the garners cautions him you spoil these nigger boys
maybe you got boys on your farm
my niggers are men
not a boy amongem
bought em thataway raisedem thataway
beg to differ garner
aint no nigger men
not if you scared
but if you a man yourself youll want your niggers to be men too
wouldnt have no nigger men around my wife
neither would i
neither would i
sethe hides a smile as she hands a piece of corn to halle
paul a and paul f hesitate as they think of eating the corn which the lovers consummated
but sixo digs right in
paul d eats slowly his eyes never leaving sethe as she moves around the kitchen her eyes never leaving halle
pauls attraction and love for her are apparent
on paul on his back turned away from sethe
what began as sethes memory has blended into pauls
sethe rises off the bed breaking the thick silence between them ill call you when theres something to eat
she exits leaving paul alone on the bed
we see the house now
no creaking or sounds of breaking furniture
just the sound of paul d
paul is singing as he fixes the table he broke while driving the baby ghost away
denver is sweeping the floor irritated by pauls presence and voice
they both hear the front door open as sethe arrives home from work
they look to each other to see which one will make a move for sethe first
paul knows enough to bide his time with denver
he watches as she places the broom down and exits the kitchen
paul and sethe sit on the porch together
sethe is sewing
paul nervously gets up his nerve to ask sethe
she stops and looks i was thinking of looking for work around here
what do you think
hogs is fine
paul moves to where sethe is sitting
i dont need much sethe
eat sleep sing a little when it strikes me
i dont ask for more to
to live somewhere
sethe realizes what he is asking and tentatively responds all right
its fine with me
your girl denver
seems shes of a different mind
dont worry about her
shes a charmed child
nothing ever touch her too bad
from the beginning
everybody i knew dead or gone but not her
pause you got to know something though this here aint no better life
its just not that other one
what i do here all i ever do is keep denver from that other
so if you stay theres no more talk about sweet home or anything else
i wont let the past in my yard again
getting me and denver through this here life is all that matters
dangerous to love anything that much sethe
best thing is to love everything just a little bit
that way when it breaks or runs off or gets taken well maybe youd have a little love left over for the next one
dont be asking me to choose paul d
there aint no choice here
thats the whole point
im not asking you to choose
just want to know if theres some space for me
want to know if its more than you can stay its fine
more like i want you here paul
sethe is frightened by the prospect of feeling for him
maybe we should leave things the way they are
sethe rises to enter the house when pauls words stop her how are they
we get along
what about inside
i dont go inside
sethe if im here with you with denver you can go anywhere you want
jump if you want to cause ill catch you
go as far inside as you need ill hold your ankles
make sure you get back out
im not saying this because i need a place to stay
i told you im a walking man but i been heading in this direction for seven years
when i got here and sat out there on the porch waiting for you well i knew it wasnt the place i was heading toward
it was you
we can make a life girl
scared i dont know
i dont know
leave it to me
see how it goes
no promises if you dont want to make any
just see how it goes all right
sethes heart is twisted
she wants to cry
because she feels hope
and because she feels fear
well see how it goes
you willing to leave it to me
some of it
sethe manages a smile
denver lies curled up in her bed
sethe enters and crawls in unexpectedly
denver looks up surprised to see her
what is it
lay back down
denver obeys unsure
you think baby ghosts really gone
i miss her
sethe lets out a small laugh
baby suggs told me baby ghost would never hurt me
she was my sister
when i was little after the boys left i used to think that she and me both were waiting for daddy to come
and once he did she wouldnt be mad no more
sethe listens sadly they hear paul singing out on the porch
wish hed shut up
hes ruined everything
no he hasnt
he wants to takes us to the carnival next thursday
denvers eyes light up with excitement then caution
you mean go out where theyll be other people
dress up a little bit
wear our hats
what do you think
downplaying her excitement maybe
difficult for her to say can i ask you something
denver nods her back to sethe i was wondrin
what you think about us
maybe thinking we could start
if we got an idea to thinking we could start
she stops on what mama
countin on what
sethe can barely bring herself to say
but for denver she forces herself and whispers something
paul and sethe and denver walk among the hundreds of black townspeople gathered for the carnival
a sign reads colored thursday
two pennies entrance fee
paul is in high spirits
saying hello to anyone whose eye he catches
willing eager to get anything for denver she wants
feeling a little more like a normal van in a normal life
denver is excited but worried
she doesnt want to like paul but cant help the thrill shes feeling
and when one or two passersby shout out hey denver
hi there denver
denver heart almost weeps with joy
sethe walks cautiously
overdressed for the occasion it is her first outing among neighborhood folk in many years
she catches the eyes of some of the women she knows
ella and lady jones
good christian women who nod in their acknowledgement yet are holding back something
paul doesnt notice them and for this sethe is glad
montage of scenes
the various carnival acts all performed by a white troupe magic clowning fire swallowing spitting ribbons acrobats forming pyramids
our trio take it all in like water to the thirsty
at one point a white carnival barker shouts to the children all pickaninnies free
the phrase stabs sethe and paul a bit
but paul whispers two pennies and an insult well spent in my opinion to see the spectacle of whitefolks making a spectacle of themselves
sethe cant help but let out a small laugh and with that laugh a sudden sensation of relief
paul buys denver some licorice peppermint and lemonade
holding the lemonade for her paul asks mind if i take a sip
paul takes some lemonade then wipes the rim where he sipped with a small napkin and gently hands it back to her
denver in spite of herself is starting to like him
our trio are leaving the carnival walking three astride with distance in between each
the sunlight casts strong shadows
sethes eyes glance towards the ground behind them and sees their three shadows are holding hands
as they walk home
wide angle of a beautiful wide stream more like a small river with a mulberry tree standing tall on the bank before it
there is not a soul in sight as the stream moves gracefully beneath the sun
exhausted sopping wet and breathing heavily as if from asthma she sits leaning against the mulberry tree
she seems too tired to even hold her head upon her neck
yet her skin is like new lineless and smooth
although racked with pain she is smiling
smiling the way travellers smile when they have finally arrived after a long and arduous journey
the young black woman makes her way through the woods
she passes by denvers boxwood bush secret place
then continues forward as if with a specific direction in mind
sethe paul and denver approach
denver is the first to see
what is that
all three look to see the young black woman sitting on a stump not far from the steps of
as the three approach the young woman lifts her head and stares directly at sethe
the two women exchange a moment in their eyes sethe curious yet warm
the young woman happy yet there is a hunger in her stare
the young woman seated on a chair as denver refills a tin cup of water
the young woman drinks greedily cup after cup
you from around here
the young woman shakes her head no
she reaches down and takes off her shoes which sethe notices as new
sethe bends down to pick them up
the young woman never lets her eyes leave sethe
those shoes look brand new
what might your name be
the young woman speaks in a low rough voice beloved
sethe drops the shoes
denver sits down
paul smiles beloved
you use a last name beloved
she spells it as she spells it we see sethes reaction she is deeply touched
then denvers who looks both amazed and curiously excited
sethe hangs her own hat on a peg then approaches beloved
thats a pretty name beloved
take off your hat and ill make us something
we just got back from the carnival over near cincinnati but beloved has fallen asleep upright in the chair
miss you want to lay down
her eyes open to slits
paul is about to help her when denver rises ill take her up
she can sleep in baby suggs room that all right mama
denver eases beloved onto her feet which sethe and paul notice do not have a line or sore on them
whispers to sethe look at her feet
theyre not walking feet
more like she rode from somewhere all the way here
yet beloved can barely stand upon them as denver escorts her to the white staircase
beloved starts coughing
sounds like the croup
is she feverish denver
then she is
fever goes from hot to cold
could have the cholera
adamant shes not sick
denver helps her up the stairs
sethe and paul register denvers defensive reaction
denver eases beloved into the bed
beloved falls asleep the second she hits the pillow
denver gently cautiously strokes beloveds forehead and cheek
denver stands vigil beside beloved wrapped beneath a quilt
denver watches her sleep wiping her hot forehead with cold cloths
denver washes out beloveds underwear and stockings
she hears beloved murmuring
she moves quickly to her side
beloved im here
what is it
this place is heavy
would you like to sit up
beloved shakes her head no
she takes hold of denvers arm and wraps it around her own body
denver sits up against the pillow as beloved snuggles her body into denvers arms and falls back asleep
denver holds her lovingly
denver has not left her bedside
she places another quilt upon her tucking it in around the sides
as she does this beloveds eyes open for a brief moment catching the sight of denver over her
denver gratefully smiles back
can i get you anything
are you hungry
beloved looks over to a plate of half finished food denvers meal
denver picks up a piece of sweet bread and feeds her
denver is thrilled
denver places sugar between two pieces of bread and gives the sandwich to beloved who no longer feeling sickly accepts it with a bright smile
denver explains how to pack mud in the cracks of the hen house as beloved listens attentively eating jelly out of a jar
denver explains to beloved how to warm the chicks with their skirts as the latter eats something sweet
they both giggle at the softness of the chicks
denver is showing beloved how to make her bed
then you fold it over like this see
this here used to be where my brothers and me slept
i was always at the top
how you get so smart
i aint so smart
yes you are
well i used to go to lady jones
shed teach us with songs how to spell and count
you dont go no more
i had to stop going
you so smart
tell me about your brothers
theyre names were howard and
as denver continues beloved steps towards her and begins to touch her face examining her lips her nose her skin as if it were a rose to admire
denver drinks in the attention her heart expanding with love with every touch from this strange creature
at night we used to
crawl into bed together
id lay down on buls lap and howard would tell us die witch stories
he said they would protect us
and if i learned them they would protect me if ever they were gone
everyone is sitting on the porch after dinner
beloved looking strong and fit eats a cane stick gnawing at it to the flax keeping the strings in her mouth long after the syrup had been sucked off
it makes denver laugh as she licks her cane stick
it makes sethe smile to see them both happy
it makes paul disgusted
paul confronts sethe as she sews
you gonna just feed her from now on
denver likes her
shes no real trouble
but dont she have a home
some place to go
didnt mention one
i thought wed wait until her breathing got better
she still sounds a little lumbar
she breathe like she can eat she could blow this whole house down
and all those sweets
sometimes the body needs that sugar for strength when its trying to recover after an illness
but thats just it
she dont seem sick
something funny about her
acts sick sounds sick but she dont look sick
good skin bright hands and strong as a bull
she can hardly walk without holding onto something
thats what i mean
cant walk but i passed by baby suggs room this morning and saw her lifting the rocker with one hand
dont tell me
she was right there
at that moment denver passes by on her way to the kitchen
come in here a minute
denver enters the keeping room
paul says you saw beloved pick up the rocking chair in baby suggs room with one hand
denver looks at paul with a hard gaze i didnt see no such thing
from pauls expression we can tell denver is lying
and whatever fragile connection they were building is swiftly destroyed
sethe is getting ready for bed
denver sticks her head in have you seen her
i cant find her
sethe shakes her head
denver exits anxiously
the mentions of beloveds name stir a memory in sethe sethe talks to the headstone engraver as he works in the hot sun
his young son helps him
she need a marker
somethin to tell me where she is
but i aint got no money
the engraver eyes her body
what you got then
sethe is embarrassed by his lascivious tone especially in front of the young boy
the engraver rises takes a step toward sethe and touches her hip curling his hand around to her back
what you want it to say
i was thinking what the preacher say at the funeral
touching her for ten minutes i give you one word for free
his hand glides down to her buttocks
sethe cant help but see the young boy watching the scene
end of memory
as the memory starts to fade form her mind sethe suddenly feels someone elses presence
she looks up to find beloved standing by the door watching her
i didnt know you were there
can i help
help what honey
beloved kneels before her on the floor and finishes buttoning up sethes night dress
where you go in the morning
i work in a restaurant
what time you go
little after the sun come up
i like to make a loaf of bread before i go
how you feelin
beloved nods absorbing the information
you remember your mother at all
scratching back of her head i remember a woman who was mine and i remember bein snatched away from her
sethe nods understanding such things
she cautiously reaches out to stroke beloveds face
beloved responds like a puppy pressing her cheek against sethes hand
sethe is moved
sethe enters the kitchen to make bread before she leaves for work
she finds beloved waiting for her placing out her cooking things on the table
beloved looks up and smiles
im helpin make your bread
beloved waits anxiously at the window for the sight of sethe coming home from work
when she sees her she runs through the house out the door to meet her
denver appears at the door upset by beloveds loss of attention in her
sethe as she leans her tired head against the porch sitting on the step
she closes her eyes and is about to drift off when beloveds hand gently touches her shoulder settling there
sethe looks up and smiles patting her hand
beloved stands above her as denver takes a seat on the step
beloved searches sethes eyes and asks where your diamonds
the question surprises sethe
and startles denver
what would i be doing with diamonds
on your ears
wish i did
come to think of it i had some crystal once
a present from mrs
garner woman i worked for at sweet home
i never saw you with no earrings
tell me about your diamonds
beloved kneels at her feet
to beloved maam dont talk about sweet home
ignoring her tell me
tell me about your diamonds
denver awaits her mothers reaction with great interest
sethe looks at beloved sweet innocent expression and something in her resistance eases well
this lady i worked for in kentucky gave them to me when i got married
denver is both interested and slightly hurt at her mothers willingness to tell beloved what shed never tell her what they called married back then
i remember going up to her in the kitchen to tell her
id help her make ink for mr
garner in the kitchen
i was fool enough to think i was going have some kind of ceremony
maybe even a new dress
sethes continues telling beloved an attentive audience
denver more attuned to beloveds interest than the story is disturbed at her mothers telling of it
camera moves up from the mended legs of the table paul broke to a suspicious paul glares at beloved as they eat dinner
beloved is ever ready to pass sethe a bowl or napkin or whatever she needs
she is shining for sethe and for sethe alone
denver notices it as well
it is raining outside
both denver and beloved are wet from the rain
denvers hair is all tangled
best unbraid that hair
todays always here
comb it everyday it wont
your woman never fixed up your hair
all three look to beloved puzzled by her question which is clearly intended for sethe
pauls getting more annoyed
you mean my mother
paul and denver exchange a curious look
if she did i dont remember
i dont think i saw her but a few times
tell me bout her
paul and denver look to sethe waiting to see if shell answer
i remember once she picked me up and carried me behind the smokehouse
the only thing i do remember in fact
paul is disturbed by sethes carefree storytelling how it contradicts her words to him that first day and worried it will lead to no good
once again denver is surprised to hear what shes never heard before
she looks to paul and knows what he is thinking
paul looks back and knows denver realizes it
but denver returns his glance with a defensive dismissal of the eyes
she opened up her dress and right on her rib right here was a circle and a cross burnt right into the skin
interrupts her sethe
paul doesnt want her to continue but doesnt want to say so
any more beans
sethe rises to get him more food and she continues anyway she points to this mark and says to me this is your maam
i am the only one whose got this mark now
the rest all dead
if something happens to me and you cant tell me by my face you can know me by this mark
scared me so
i couldnt think of anything to say so i said yes maam
but how will you know us
mark me too
mark the mark on me too
she slapped my face
i didnt understand it then
not until i had a mark of my own
paul is disturbed
he can see sethe getting upset
he is mad at beloved for her damn questions
what happened to her
something inside of sethe stops a wall erected
something unwanted is coming into her consciousness
paul notices it
she rises dont know
sethe collects a few dishes and crosses to the sink as paul asks well as long as were all asking questions getting to know each other
to beloved why dont you tell us a little bit about yourself
camera follows sethe as she arrives at the sink placing the dish inside
we hear the others o
defensively she dont remember nothing
you be surprised what you start remembering once you start talking
can i have some more pudding
camera stays on sethe as we drown out the voices at the kitchen table
she is staring out the window above the sink as if watching the memory being relived in her yard a crowd of people surround a tree
several white men are preparing to hang a group of black men and women standing in line awaiting their turn
among the crowd is a child sethe holding the hand of an older black slave woman nan
nan is pointing to a woman sethes mother who is one of the people waiting in line to be hanged
nan whispers to sethe thats your mama right there
little sethe looks up and sees her mother her face a mask of courage and rage and tears
she looks straight ahead not at anyone in particular especially not her daughter
im telling you small girl sethe
me and your mama was taken by the men many times
she threw them other babies away
the others from the whites without names she threw them away
but you she gave the name of the black man
she had her arms around him child
the others she did not put her arms around
the child sethe listens watching her mother move further down the line
end of memory as we cut back to sethe the memory passing hears the voices in her kitchen aint you got no brothers or sisters
i dont have nobody
she finds paul interrogating beloved who eats a second pudding
denver tries to interfere
she has us now
you been here five weeks we still dont know nothing bout you
paul stop it
denver bring those dishes
what was you looking for when you came here
i was looking for this place i could be in
somebody tell you about this place
at the sink both sethe and denver pause obviously interested
she told me
when i was at the bridge she told me
paul looks quizzically at sethe who shrugs must be somebody from the old days
howd you come
who brought you
i walked here
a long long long long way
nobody bring me
you had new shoes
if you walked so long why dont your shoes show it
stop picking on her
i want to know
whered you get them shoes and that dress you had on
i take the shoes
coughs i take the dress
coughs the shoe strings dont fit
suddenly she begins to choke on a raisin from the pudding and falls backward off the chair
denver and sethe rush towards her
beloved thrashes around until they help her turn over and spit up the raisin
she breathes in sethes arms as denver wipes up the mess glaring at paul
you all right
whispers i want to go to sleep now
come to my room
i can watch out for you up there
sethe gets beloved to her feet
denver takes her up the staircase to her room glaring at paul
when the girls have gone sethe turns on paul as she cleans up
whats the matter with you
i dont understand what the hold is
its clear why she holds onto you but i just cant see why you holding on to her
what you care whos holding on to who
feeding her is no trouble
and shes nice company for denver
we was just starting to feel a little like a family ourselves
is that whats got your teeth on edge
i cant place it
its a feeling in me
you wanna feel somethin
feel how it is to have a bed to sleep in and somebody there not worrying you to death about what you got to do each day to deserve it
and if that dont get it feel how it feels to be a colored woman roaming the roads with anything god made liable to jump on you
i know every bit of that sethe
i wasnt born yesterday and i never mistreated a woman in my life
well that makes one of you in this world
what halle ever do to you
halle stood by you
he never left you
ha whatd he leave then if not me huh
i dont know but it wasnt you
thats a fact
then he did worse he left his children
you dont know that
he wasnt there
he wasnt where he said he would be
i had to pack my babies off ahead of me on their own so i could stay behind to look for him
underground agent said by sunday we had to leave
sunday came and he wasnt there
he couldnt get out of the loft i expect
forgetting himself paul let that slip out
hesitates the one over your head
the one in the barn
sethe stops dead cold
its no use
the memory takes over violent rapid images of sethe being raped and beaten held down by schoolteachers boys
sethe pinned down stares up at the loft
camera rises up
there in the loft hides halle
the expression on his face is that of a man broken in two
end of memory
sethe wraps her arms tightly around herself and asks he saw
he told you he saw
you told me
the day i came here
you said they stole your milk
i never knew what messed halle up
that was it i guess
i seen him the day after you left
says where you been halle
all he says to me was the loft
i asked him what he meant not going with you but he never answers me
but i knew was something broke him
not one of them years of saturdays sundays and nighttime extra never touched him
but whatever he saw go on in the barn that day broke him like a twig
he saw them boys do that to me and let them keep on breathing
a man aint a goddamn ax sethe
chopping hacking busting every goddamn minute of the day
things get to him
things he cant chop down cause they inside him
the last time i saw him i knew he was broken for good
what did he say
what did you say
didnt you say anything to him
why the hell not
on paul who doesnt want to explain or even remember as we cut to he is being lead away from sweet home with other black men by three white men
the bit jerks his head back saliva spills uncontrollably out of his mouth
his hands are chained behind him
his feet chained together at the ankles
another chain is connected to an iron belt and stretches to a wagon
he is being lead away with forty five other prisoners
i tried to kill brandywine man schoolteacher sold me to
dont know what possessed me
me and about other prisoners were being walked from kentucky to virginia
then on to georgia
two places i dont ever want to see again
he is lead past the milk shed when he sees halle alone with a crazed faraway look in his eyes sitting by the butter churn
halles face is covered with butter and clabber
he sticks his hands in the churn and continues to cover his face with the sticky slippery white substance covering his face and head squeezing it through his hands
the white men laugh
paul is aching to scream out to him but the iron bit holds down his tongue
as paul is lead past halle a rooster named mister is sitting on a tub in the sun shrieks with an almost arrogant glee
look at mister there
referring to the rooster you go tell these niggers where to go there mister
crowem right outta here
mister crows and the white men laugh
tears of rage and humiliation stream down pauls face
he struggles to keep a view of halle until he is out of sight
paul approaches sethe touching her gently
i didnt mean to tell you that
i didnt plan on hearing it
i cant take it back but i can leave it alone
sethe instead of collapsing from the information she seems hardened
lets do that
lets leave it alone now
more to herself let it alone
just sit down and leave it be
yeah that would be nice
would be even nicer to lose it altogether if i had my choice
other peoples brains stopped went crazy
how sweet that would have been
me and halle squatting by that churn smashing cold lumpy butter in our faces not a care in the world
sethe dont do this
what a relief to just stop it all right there huh
close it shut
squeeze that butter
but i had three children on their way to ohio and nothing would have changed that
and you tell me he didnt leave me
sethe exits o
paul is left alone on the porch until beloved runs out of the house giggling with denver in pursuit
as denver passes paul sarcastically remarks guess shes feeling better huh
denver gives him a quick disdainful look then continues after beloved
the two girls run towards the woods
beloved is dancing beneath a bright moon
denver is an attentive grateful audience
whered you learn to dance
look at me do this
she puts her fists on her hips and skips
she takes denvers hand and places another on her shoulder
as they dance denver laughs harder and harder a giddiness from the dizziness and the gratitude she feels for beloveds attention
they spin and fall to the ground like two lovers nestled
beloved catches her breath as denver asks why you call yourself beloved
in the dark my name is beloved
whats it like where you were before
a thoughtful expression dark
im small in that place
im like this here
were you cold
nothing to breathe there
no room to move
how did you get here
i wait then i got on the bridge
i stay there in the dark in the daytime in the dark in the daytime
all this time you were on the bridge
when i got out
whyd you come here
to see her face
and with that denver takes a breath of courage to ask the question shes been longing to ask you my sister aint you
you really are
beloved looks at her and smiles
they are so close she leans in curiously and touching denvers face kisses her on the lips
you wont leave us will you
this is where i am
i knew it
first time i saw you and you said your name
and when you touched me real gentle
like id felt that touch before
smiling beloved moves to touch denvers cheek when suddenly denver sits up cross legged and urges beloved dont tell mama
you musnt tell her who you really are
i dont know what shed do
please you hear
suddenly beloveds face turns to rage as she rises up as well dont tell me what to do
dont never tell me what to do
but im on your side
i want to protect you
stands above denver shes the one
shes the one i need
you can go but shes the one i have to have
beloved abruptly drops to her knees and crawls out the boxwood bush room as denvers pleads no
i didnt do nothing
we were dancing
the room is still dark from the night but the sun is rising outside
suddenly beloved awakens with a start
she senses something
she rises and looks out the window to see beloved quickly grabs her clothes and exits to follow her as denver awakens just in time to see her go
sethe is dressed as if for church as she makes her way through the woods with a specific destination in mind
soon she comes upon sethe steps out of the woods and into an open clearing
a large rock sits in the clearing like a pulpit above the pews of grass and weeds
sethe remembers the place as it was
she hears the voices of a crowd
a gathering of people though the clearing remains empty
she crosses to the rock and sits
camera moves up to reveal baby suggs vital and strong standing on the rock preaching im not here to tell you all to clean up your lives and sin no
im not here to tell you were the blessed meek and are glorybound
im here to tell you that the only grace we can have is the grace we can imagine
and if you cannot see it then you shall not have it
on sethe as she remembers baby suggs words sitting alone in the clearing the images of the past gone
beloved has found her and watches from a hidden place
camera moves beyond her to find denver having followed beloved watches her from a distance
sethe remembers baby suggs advice god lead you home
so now layem down child
sword and shield
dont study war no more
lay all that mess down
sword and shield
sword and shield
she slides to the ground and holds her head to weep
she covers her head from god and cries as she lets the memories come
memories she can no longer fight from coming sethe is in the same bent over position only here her back is exposed and she is being beaten by the schoolteachers
the boy beating sethe never stops with the whip for a second as he rants they beat her mercilessly
sethe tear stained bloody and very pregnant fights her way through a corn field as she makes her escape
her dress hangs torn at the back her wounds open and bleeding
her feet already swollen and blistered
she is in agonizing pain
she moves like a figure in a nightmare
sethe falls to the ground unable to move her contractions have started and the pain is unbearable
her breasts are leaking on her sweat stained body
her legs are scratched and bleeding from moving through broken twigs and rock
on her back the tree is starting to form
she lays there waiting for death
until a voice asks sethe can not answer as she hears two feet moving through the field
she clutches her pregnant stomach as if somehow she might hide it from whoever might be coming to harm her
a raggedly looking white girl with arms like cane stalks and enough hair for five heads steps through into view
if that dont beat all
sethe can not speak for fear
man you bout the scariest looking something i ever seen
what you doing back up here
sethe manages to control her breath and push out the word running
amy looks at sethes swollen bloody flesh at the end of her legs
them the feet you running on
my jesus my
semi delerious am i in ohio
fool girl you in kentucky
you bout a thousand miles from ohio
murmurs to herself im still in kentucky
you got anything on you gal pass for food

thats why i come up here

i expect this baby maam is gonna die in these wild onions
amy doesnt know what to do with that information
well i got to eat something
any stands and looks as if shes about to leave when sethe feeling the girl is safe stops her with a question
where you on your way to miss
eager to tell boston

boston is that far
farther than ohio

whats it like
sethe desperately wants her to stay to not be alone
amy kneels back down to her curious now what they call you
what you gonna do just lay there and foal
i cant get up
i cant get up
amy wipes her nose and looks up beyond sethe
theres a house back yonder
well not a house with people in it more like a lean to near the river
make a difference does it
you stay here snake might get you
well he may come but i cant stand up let alone walk
and god help me i cant crawl
sure you can lu
amy helps sethe turn over onto all fours
amy walks beside sethe as the latter painfully crawls taking moments to stop and let the pain go through her
come on lu
you got to move faster than that
you wont get to ohio til you ninety years old you keep moving that ways
amy makes a pile of leaves for sethe to lay on and some rocks for her to put up her feet
she talks non stop as she works
never know it to look at me but i used to be a good size
nice arms everything
that was before they put me in the root cellar
she eases sethe onto the leaves then lifts her feet onto the rocks
mama worked for these people here to pay for her passage but then she had me and died right after so i had to work forem
i was fishing off the beaver once and a nigger floated right by me
i dont like drowned people do you
your feet remind me of him
all swole like
amy props sethe up from behind when she notices you all bloody back here
gal you a mess
undo your dress let me see
sethe makes a tremendous effort just to turn to her side as amy undoes her dress lord i aint never seen a poorer excuse for a amy sees sethes back
and for a moment is speechless
its a tree lu
a chokecherry tree
i had me some whippings but i dont remember nothing like this
glad i aint you
what god have in mind i wonder

spiderwebs all i can do for you
whats in here aint enough
ill look outside
maybe i ought to break them blossoms open and let the pus run
rises smiles that you aint dead yet lus a miracle

to sethes amazement amy begins to massage her feet and legs the pain of which causes sethe to cry
its gonna hurt now
anything dead coming back to life hurts
stop wiggling girl
sings talks dont up and die on me in the night you hear me lu
i dont want to see your ugly face hankering over me
if you do die just go on off somewhere where i cant see you hear

amy continues singing
sethe is trying to walk holding on to amy at first then a tree
cause of me you up and walking

yeah you good
whats that all over your dress

amy doesnt know what to say so she says you hungry
sethe keeps trying to walk i aint nothing but in a hurry miss

i figured how
amy cutting two pieces form sethe shawl then filling them with leaves and tying them over her feet sethe and amy walk towards the river when then see a small
abandoned rowboat with oars
jesus looking at you girl
sethe cant believe her eyes
she walks right into the water when suddenly her own water breaks and her labor begins
she doubles up in pain what you doing that for
aint you got a brain in your head
stop that right now
i said stop it lu
you the dumbest thing on this here earth lu
sethe on her knees crawls into the boat and props her feet up
water leaks in wherever it can rising up as high as her waist
amy takes her position to assist
oh jesus im awful sorry bout the braggin
i need you here now
come on jesus
dont be getting lost on me now
sethe screams in agony as the child pushes through
amy curses damn daddies never around cept for the fun part
biggest joke god made on woman was giving men the planters stead of the soil
gasping amys strong hands pull denvers head out and up to meet sethes eyes
sethe cannot believe this creature made it through
amy rinses it with water then wrapping it in her skirt holds it up to sethe
shes never gonna know who i am
you gonna tell her
who brought her into this world
you better tell her you hear
you say miss amy denver
sethe awakens mud caked on the banks of the river
her baby girl crying beside her
amy is gone
she rises painfully picks up her child and continues on her way
a thunderstorm cracks across the sky and floods the river
sethe is sitting beneath the oak the rain soaking her as she breast feeds her baby
she cries out loud but her sobs and tears are lost in the rain and thunder
sethe walks downriver with denver tied to her chest
she stops when she sees a flatbed gliding down river
she cant make out if theyre white people or not so she hides behind a tree until it passes waiting behind the tree we see that sethe is sweating a
but denver seems to be doing fine
she sees the flatbed pass her and continues on her way
she sees three colored people an older man and two boys fishing
she approaches cautiously
one of the boys is the first to see her
sethes bloody and torn clothes and her feverish face make her quite a sight to the young boy
he taps the old man on the shoulder and motions for him to turn around
the old man takes in sethe and instantly knows where shes been and why shes there
anybody know you coming
my mother in law over in
stamp paid raises his hand to stop her
he looks around to see that no one else is in sight then motions for her to sit on a rock
as she does he gets a water jug and hands it to her she drinks like a madman in the desert
the boys watch in fascination
stamp paid turns to one of them and says take off that coat
you heard me
the boy slips out of his jacket complaining
what am i gonna wear
you want it back
he unties the baby from sethe and wraps it in the coat
then you go head and take it off this baby
and if you can do that then go way somewhere and dont come back
on a flatbed stamp paid crosses the river with sethe her baby and the two boys
stamp paid helps sethe walk up a very steep bank while the boy without a jacket carries the baby who wears it
stamp paid leads sethe and the others into the hutch
somebody be here directly
theyll find you
whats your name so i can remember you right
watch out for that baby you hear
she nods as he and the boys exit
sethe is asleep with the baby when ella enters the hutch saw the sign a while ago but i couldnt get here no quicker
stamp always leave the old sty open when theres a crossing
knots a white rag on the post if its a child too
kneels my names ella
where you headed
ella empties a sack with a wool blanket cotton cloth two baked sweet potatoes and a pair of mens shoes
my mother in laws
names baby suggs
she got my other three children i sent ahead
when was this one born
i hope she makes it
hard to say
gives her mens shoes lets try to get these on your feet
baby suggs rises off the bench on the porch when she sees sethe coming up the walk
she runs to her and embraces sethe and the baby tears in her eyes
oh my lord
my sweet lord thank you
baby suggs welcomes sethe into the house kissing her hard on the lips
sethe cant believe shes in her arms
sethe looks at her with confusion and exhaustion
he wasnt there
a flash of fear is quickly transformed into pragmatism
well he be along presently im sure
where are the children
you too ugly looking to wake em up in the night
first we get you well
baby suggs bathes sethe first her face her body
hands arms legs
when she gets to her unrecognizable feet she touches them
you feel this
baby suggs notices roses of blood on sethes back
she looks and covers her mouth when she sees the remnants of the whipping
baby suggs with two other grown women attend to sethes back greasing it and pinning double thicknesses of cloth to the inside of a newly stitched dress
sethe sitting in bed with her new dress and her wounds dressed waits for her children
baby suggs opens the door and the boys are ushered in
sethe welcomes them to her arms
they run to her jumping on the bed
the startle causes some pain but sethe doesnt care
the little girl beloved is crawling and ushered toward her mama
already crawling aint that somethin
come on baby girl
right this way
sethe picks her up and the tears flow
she cant stop kissing them their necks their heads their hands
the boys inspect her strange looking feet and ask pappie come
baby suggs seems doubtful but appreciates the lie for the children
all right boys mamas home now you be seeing her all the time
go downstairs and get your supper
sethe hugs and kisses them as if for the last time as if she still doesnt believe she can just get out of bed walk downstairs and be with them
the boys leave as sethe cradles the little girl
sethe anxiously undoes her dress and carefully guides her breast to the little girl
she winces with pain and smiles she got her milk to her baby girl
baby suggs gathers the rags sethe wore when she first arrived
nothing worth saving here
look and see if theres something knotted up in the petticoat
baby suggs finds two crystal earrings
be nice if there was a groom to go with it
what do you think happened to him
i dont know
he wasnt where he said to meet him at
i had to get out
i had to
hell make it
if i made it halle sure can
skeptical well put these on maybe theyll light his way
as sethe takes the earrings the little baby girl reaches for them
through her eyes we see them sparkle and shine like diamonds
baby suggs hands gently massage sethes neck as she says whatever happens now
god lead you home
so now layem down sethe
sword and shield
dont study war no more
lay all that mess down
sword and shield
sethe surrenders herself to baby suggs firm safe hands letting go of the diamonds one of which lands in the hands of the little girl
who plays with them in fascination
sethe is remembering these last images she eases her own hand up to her neck rubbing herself the way baby suggs did
she realizes how much she misses her
and wonder who can touch her now and help her lay it all down
and then quite suddenly paul
there is paul
sethe realizes as images flash across sethe rises from the ground as if with a new realization
she begins to walk out of the clearing and into the woods her pace increasing with each image
sethe walks through the woods passing beloved unawares who has fallen asleep by a tree
beloved is awakened as sethe walks by and gets to her feet to follow
further on sethe passes a sleeping denver who also awakens upon hearing the footsteps of her mother followed by beloved
sethe walks on unaware of them following her
wide angle of sethe walking well ahead of beloved and denver
sethe is walking with great purpose and energy
sethe enters and runs through the house to the kitchen paul
paul you home
paul sits in a tub under the white staircase
sethe is relieved
grateful to find him there for her
where else would i be on a sunday off
sethe smiles almost in tears
why dont you come on in here
what if the girls came in
i dont hear nobody
i have to cook
stands up in the tub and holds sethe against his wet naked body
what you gonna cook
loving his body and his attention i thought id make some snap beans
fry up a little corn
he kisses her and thats exactly what she wanted
im right here baby
thank you lord
camera slowly moves out of the kitchen as sethe and paul begin to make love revealing beloved watching from the doorway unknown to sethe or paul
she is disgusted envious
and runs out
beloved runs out of the house and heads back for the woods
she passes denver as if she werent there
beloved reaches the stream and steps in
she begins to violently hit the water around her then begins hitting her own face and head clawing at it as if to escape from the boundaries of flesh
suddenly she submerges herself underwater and holds herself there as if to drown herself
she bursts out of the water gasping for air
slowly her rage subsides replaced with a calm ruthless understanding beloved is walking back toward the house
she looks back at the house to the kitchen window knowing paul and sethe are in there
she approaches the kitchen window and looks in
pov sethe is drying off pauls body and rebuttoning her dress
camera moves slowly into a c
of beloved this time her focus is on paul
the inhabitants eat dinner in silence
denver awaits a look from beloved
as beloved passes her a bowl of peas with a smile denver is satisfied
beloved then turns to paul offering him the bowl
you have brothers or sisters
caught off guard paul looks to sethe whose expression asks him to be nice
we dont talk about that
sethe told us you been walking for eighteen years
where you been all that time
paul is about to get mad when he looks to sethe again reels it back in and answers curtly but politely lots of places
i dont remember them all
dont remember much about anything
you be surprised what you start remembering once you start talking
hearing his own words echoed back to him annoys him
well not me
whats gone is gone
no good come from bringing it back
paul focuses on his dinner suddenly ill at ease
he cant help looking covertly at beloved and finds beloved staring right back at him
it makes him shiver
sethe is asleep
paul is restless tossing and turning as we intercut dream images flashing across his mind
on his knees before a white guard crotch
sethe enters to find paul asleep in the rocker by the stove
she stirs him
waking up mmmm
i called you two or three times but i gave up round midnight
i thought maybe you went out somewhere
im sorry honey
ill make some breakfast you get yourself washed up
sethe begins to make breakfast as beloved enters the kitchen and sees paul has slept in the rocker
she looks at him with a smile as if she knows more than shes letting on
paul registers the look
paul is asleep in the rocker
he is restless
he dreams paul is chained by the ankles to forty five other men
he hands are shackled
in his mouth an iron bit
the men are being led by white guards with rifles
camera follows them under a burning sun as they approach a trench
one thousand feet long
five feet deep
five feet wide
camera tilts down to reveal within the trench wooden boxes with scrap limber roofs and a door of bars fitted on them like a cage that opens up to a
wall of red dirt stretching two feet above the top of the bars themselves
his face and body drenched in sweat
walks across the field with a thin blanket over his nightclothes walking toward the storeroom
in the window of her bedroom sethe watches him sensing he is moving further and further away from her
in the window of denvers room beloved watches paul as well with a pleased expression
three white men walk along the trench unlocking the cage doors one by one
one by one the black men emerge and stand in a line in the trench
when all are assembled a second rifle shot signals them to climb out of the trench to the ground above
waiting for them above the trench is one thousand feet of chain
each black man bends over and waits as the first man on line threads the chain through his leg iron passing it to the second and so on
as they connect each other to the chain camera pans down the line of men and while not a word is spoken we hear their thoughts
thoughts to themselves or if possible through their eyes to the man beside them im a make it
steady now steady
this mornins bad
the white guards walk passed them
one white guard stops in front of the man beside paul d
he turns to him
want some breakfast nigger
here you go
the white guard unzips his fly and undoes his pants and moves a step closer to the black mans mouth
looks ahead trembling
the guard steps away as another guard steps in and hits paul on the shoulder with a rifle
the black men work
sledge hammers in hand
as they work miraculously they sing
they sing about the women they knew the children they had been
they sing of bosses and masters and misses
of mules and dogs and the shamelessness of life
they sing of sisters long gone
they sing love songs to death
a torrential downpour
the men in the wooden cages watch the rain filling the trench corroding the red dirt wall around them
bugs and human debris swirl around their legs and feet
mud covering them through the cracks of the scrap lumber roof
some finds rest
others minds are long gone
camera finds paul
he is screaming
but there is no sound coming from his mouth
tears flow down his face but when he touches them he realizes they are tears of mud
he looks up and the wooden planked roof is breaking under the power of the rain
he looks down and the water is up to his thighs
suddenly the chain linking his feet is pulled and he is knocked down
he gets up searches through the mud for the chain and notices its slack
he pulls as well
one by one the men in the boxes realize the chains end is being undone by the rain as camera tracks down towards the last box to the dirt wall
into which the chain has been locked
it is giving way within the muddy wall
of the trench before mud and water drown them
paul climbs with the will of ten men with every ounce of strength he has left
end of memory
is wide awake
the memories wont let him sleep
winter has arrived and the night is cold
he lies underneath a thin blanket in yet another sleeping place even further from the house
he adds newspapers under and around his body to stay warm
he looks as if he has given up on sleeping altogether
he hears the door to the cold room open
but he does not turn to look
what do you want in here
beloved enters the cold room
i want you to touch me on the inside part and call me my name
she hoists up her skirt and turns her head away
paul stares at a silver lard can so as not to look
when good people take you in and treat you good you ought to try to be good back
sethe loves you
much as her own daughter
you know that
drops her skirt she dont love me like i love her
i dont love nobody but her
then what you come in here for
i want you to touch me on the inside part
ever since you come here feel like i got a new devil to face
you have to touch me
on the inside part
and you have to call me my name
aint no chains on me no more
i dont have to do nothing
now go back in that house and go to bed
paul continues to stare at the lard can like lots wife hes fearful what turning to look will do
call me my name
beloved moves closer right up behind him entwining her arms around his body like chains
aint no chains on me
aint no chains on me
ill go if you say it
tears well up in his eyes
paul can feel her warmth
beloved presses her body against his
he turns and grabs her kissing her with a passion bordering on hatred
denver sits outside the cold house and listens to the sounds of lovemaking
sethe denver paul and beloved eat dinner
beloved is wrapping her body with a blanket as paul lies on his bed of newspapers their lovemaking finished
beloved gives him a final look no tenderness or affection or even friendliness
just a cold look void of respect or even attraction
she exits the cold house leaving paul alone
he is on the verge of tears
paul stands above the sleeping sethe his guilt driving him mad
he wants to touch her to wake her to ask for forgiveness and help
but he can not and buries his head in his hands
paul waits outside in the cold cupping his hands and breathing inside to keep them warm
he is rehearsing look here sethe
you aint gonna like what i got to say but i got to say it
see its not the
a man cant
what i mean is it aint really me
see it aint weakness the kind of weakness i can fight that girl is doing it
i know you think i never liked her nohow still dont but she is doing it to me anyway
fixing me sethe shes fixed me and i cant break it
sethe appears exiting the back door of the restaurant with a scrap pan in the crook of her arm
to her surprise
she finds paul waiting for her
man you make me feel like a young girl you coming by to pick me up after work
nobody ever did that before
better watch out i might start looking forward to it
she tosses the bones and skins from the scrap pan into a heap before four dogs who wait there as if by appointment
got to rinse this out
she enters the restaurant
paul watches the dogs eat watching them getting what they wanted
sethe re appears with a cloth over her head
you get off early or what
i took off early
anything the matter
in a way of speaking
not cut back
they got plenty of work with them pigs
more they can handle
sethe waits you aint gonna like what im about to say sethe
sethe steps forward to hear what paul came to tell her
there is no apprehension or anger in her look
instead a calm resolve as if she were already able to accept whatever he had to tell her without it being anyones fault
as if she already knew he cane to say he was leaving her
well say it paul d
whether i like it or not
paul knows what shes expecting
and when he sees her diminished expectation the melancholy without blame in her eyes
he cant tell her about beloved
he is filled with respect and admiration for her in that moment
something pops into his head and out of his mouth that wasnt planned i want you pregnant sethe
would you do that for me
sethe breaks up with laughter
paul joins in
you came by here to ask me that
you are one crazy headed man
you right i dont like it
dont you think im a little too old to start that all over again
she slips her fingers into his
think about it
paul lifts them putting the tips of her fingers on his cheek
he smiles broadly she laughs shaking her head
a burden transformed into a gift so suddenly
they begin walking
sethe and paul catch and snatch each others fingers stealing quick pats on the behind joyfully
paul throws his arm around sethe and squeezes
she lets her head touch his chest
they stop and stay that way for a moment not breathing
sethe closes her eyes
paul looks up to the trees lining the roadside like defending arms against attack
softly suddenly it begins to snow
sethe opens her eyes mercy
on the road towards paul and sethe run hand in hand
snow falling all around them
i been on my feet all day paul d
where i been
i dont have the legs for this
they slow to a walk
then giveem to me
before she can stop him paul hoists sethe up over his shoulders
you need some babies
somebody to play with in the snow
i sure would like to give it a try
need a willing partner though
very very willing
they continue laughing and moving down bluestone road when they are jolted by the appearance of beloved
waiting in her usual place for sethe
her hands wrapped in a long shawl waiting to be given to sethe
her eyes only on sethe not even acknowledging pauls presence
sethe gets herself down from paul
you out here with nothing on
she takes the shawl from beloveds hands and wraps it around her shoulders
you got to learn more sense than that
she walks on ahead with beloved
paul suddenly icy cold and filled with anger walks behind
denver waits on the porch
sethe and beloved walk by her
sethe and beloved enter the house
as paul approaches he stops before denver
their eyes meet
paul stares at her as if to ask whos ally are you
denver unnerved by his look runs into the house
paul waits on the porch until a moment later sethe re appears
now i know you not sleeping out there tonight are you paul d
paul doesnt reply you come upstairs tonight
where you belong
and stay there
as if healed by her strength pauls face melts into relief
denver is cleaning the dishes
beloved sits like an angry upset five year old with her fingers in her mouth
she likes him here
to denver make him go away
shed be mad if he leaves
beloved didnt consider that
her fingers move violently in her mouth as if something were bothering her
until finally she pulls out a back tooth
her lips slightly bloody
didnt that hurt you
its like my dreams
i get two dreams see
one i exploding
the other i being swallowed
sometimes its hard to keep my head on my neck or these legs connected to my hips
one day i think i might wake up and ill be in pieces
looks at tooth maybe its starting
cleans beloveds mouth oh stop
its just a tooth
does it hurt
then why dont you cry
if it hurts why dont you cry
beloved eases herself into denvers arms and cries
we see sethe and paul united as the snow begins to pile up
sethe lies with paul in the dark her face looking up to the ceiling
paul is asleep
on her face are reservations
she rises crossing to the window to look out
at the same time beloved appears silently at the doorway of the room looking at sethe hurt and sad
she walks by without sethe noticing her
sethe takes a breath at the window watching the snow fall
then as she moves back to the bed
camera moves ahead of her to sethe halle and the baby girl beloved sleep together by the wall
the boys sleep together under a window
halle is trying to sleep but sethe is awake
what you think about schoolteacher
he white aint he
i mean is he different like mr
how was he different
well he and mrs
garner they aint like other whites i seen before
garner always spoke soft for one
loud or soft what they say is the same
garner let you buy out your mother
found that house for her to live in from those friends of his in ohio
if he hadnt she would have dropped in his cooking stove
still he did it
let you work off her fee lending yourself out on sundays
he could of said no
he didnt tell you no
no he didnt tell me no
she worked here ten years
if she worked another ten ya think she would have made it
i pay him for her last years and in return he got you me and three more coming
he always treated you fair
called you all men said he never wanted niggers on his farm
thats just it
we was men because he said so
we was men because we was on his land
you think he be calling us men if we ever walked off his land
when we walk dont matter what they call you
youll be free
baby girl that aint gonna happen
not by walking anyway
what you mean
schoolteacher in there told me to quit lending myself out
while the boys is small
causes sethe to look at her sleeping boys
how you gonna buy yourself out
points to the children or me
halle raises himself up to face her to give her the final blow
aint gonna be no buying us out like i did with mama
as far as schoolteacher concerned aint no other life ahead for any of us but this one
sethe understands looks to her sleeping children and is frightened
what we going to do
whispers sixo ya know he creeps out at night
he says the way they took my maam
he says freedom is that way
he and paul a
got a plan
they heard of this man what they call an underground agent
if we do what he says dont need no buy out
but what if we caught
whatd they do to us
to the children
same thing theyre doing now honey only quicker
sethe carries a big basket of berries as young howard and bulgar run ahead of her
she turns in the opposite direction and walks along the side of the house to the back entrance of the kitchen
she passes the open window of the classroom and hears which one are you doing
hearing her name sethe stops and peeks through the window
schoolteacher is standing over the student who has been writing in a notebook
schoolteacher licks his finger and thumbs a couple of pages before saying no no
thats not the way
i told you to put her human characteristics on the left her animal ones on the right
and dont forget to line them up
although sethe doesnt entirely understand something about the words disturb her
she looks to her children
garner is sick in bed with a goiter
sethe enters with some soup
i dont think i can swallow that
im sure its too thick
want me to loosen it up with a little water
take it away
bring me some cool water thats all
sethe helps her drink a glass of cold water
yes you can have quite a few
thank you sethe
now tell me i know halles no trouble but the others the pauls and sixo hows my brother in law handling them
look like it
they do what he tells them
they dont need telling
thats a mercy
i know hes no mr
but after he died i had no else to turn to
i wouldve had to sell one
it wasnt even enough selling paul f
and in my condition
i needed help
people said i shouldnt be alone here with nothing but negroes
and he is a learned man being a schoolteacher
as sethe fills mrs
garners basin with fresh water she looks out the window and sees schoolteacher outside with his students we notice he wears a very distinctive hat as mrs
garners description continues i know his ways might be a little more strict but as long as the men do as theyre told im sure itll be fine
all right im through
talking makes me tired
sethe lies beaten and raped her clothes torn her body aching and sweaty
she struggles to get to her feet and exit the barn
sethe opens the door to find her children asleep
she is about to wake them when she notices mrs
garners light is on in her bedroom window
sethe blind with rage decides theres one thing she must do before she takes her children to the meeting place
garner lies ailing through a sleepless night when her bedroom door opens
sethe enters her appearance tells all
my god sethe
what happened to you
sethe carried her baby girl in one arm her two boys by the hand with the other
they move as fast as they can
they arrive at the meeting place where a woman crouching in the field is waiting
hands her the children here
just go with her
do what i tell ya
sethe carefully hands her baby girl to the woman
put sugar water on that cloth for her to suck so she wont forget me til i come
where you going
halle wasnt there
i gotta go back
take em out
ill get there myself
i got her milk
ill get there
she kisses her baby girl a little too hard perhaps waking her
along with the boys
sethe disappears back into the corn field leaving the woman holding the baby girl
as bulgar cries out
sethe exits the corn field and heads for her living quarters when suddenly the four boys appears from out of nowhere
two restraining her one holding a horsewhip
you nigger bastard
sethe struggles and is about to scream out when she is slapped and muffled and dragged into the corn field to be beaten
sethe awakens sweating from having fallen asleep and reliving her past nightmare
she sits up and realizes where she is
she looks beside her and sees paul asleep
she lays down pressing her body against his so that there is no space between enfolding her arms around him
pigs are crying in the chute as paul stamp paid and twenty other workers push and prod them towards the slaughterhouse
although steeped in pig shit on a wintry day his hands numb from the cold paul d
is in high spirits
he sings as he works much to the amusement of his fellow co workers
hey you like this work so much maybe you best get in the chute with the others
you aint got much more sense than they do
the men laugh
paul smiles and brushes it off
aint just a job reason to sing
other things a mans got to look forward to that a job just a way to spend your day til the good times arrive
aint no such day
its all a state a mind right paul d
if you can think it it can happen
more than that
when a man can make plans then a man can make good times happen
oh the mans got plans
you saving up for a gold mine boy
more laughter better then gold my friend
me and my womans planning on starting a family
stamp paids face registers sudden concern
born free hear
now if that dont define a good tine i dont know what does
nothing born free ever again
what you talkin
nobody owns us no more
nobody gonna own my children neither
children inherit what come beforeem
just cause you cant see no chains dont mean they not there
were not free men
were somewhere between freedom and chains
and as long as the world is white thats where were stayin
the truth of this causes the men to be silent as they continue working
stamp paid looks at paul confused by what he should do
the men are on break
paul sits alone enjoying a lunch packed by sethe
stamp paid approaches and sits beside him
no matter what anybody says
i like the way you think boy
good to think that way
friend of mine baby suggs was her name
sort of became a preacher in these parts
that was her way of thinking too
when she was at her best that is
you knew baby suggs
youre not one of her sweet home men now are you
me and my brothers and her son
oh i see now
sethe told me she died soft as cream
maybe on the outside
why is that
stamp paid looks at him with sympathetic sudden understanding
you dont know son do you
see i had to figure that out first
stamp paid pulls out an old newspaper clipping from a bag he carries with him all the time
he hands it to paul who looks to see a drawing of a young black woman beneath a headline murder
who is it
that theres a picture of sethe
studies it nah that aint her mouth
i can see where you might think it around the eyes but that there aint her mouth
besides why would some black womans picture be in the paper
you dont read son do you
paul shakes head no you want me to read to you
paul senses something terribly wrong
and doesnt know whether to say yes or no
sethe is sweeping the porch
paul appears on the road
when he sees sethe on the porch in the distance he stops
sethe sees him and smiles but something about his slow approach to the house sends off an alarm within her
paul makes his way to the porch
he stops before her
already fed the girls
he shakes no want something
paul doesnt answer
instead he steps up to her as he removes the clipping from his pocket and hands it to her
sethes heart stops beating for a moment not having seen this image for many years
but shes survived worse than the telling so she faces him
best you come inside
she rises and enters the house
paul sits at the table
sethe begins her story seated before him
i dont have to tell you about sweet home
what it was
but maybe you dont know what it was like for me to get away from there
she looks for a response but expects none
i did it
i got us all out
without halle too
up til then it was the only thing i ever did on my own
and it came off right like it was supposed to
she rises and begins to move about the room circling paul as she tries to find a way to explain it all we was here
each and every one of my babies and me too
i birthed them and i got em out and it wasnt no accident
i did that
i had help of course lots of that but still it was me doing it me saying go on and now
me having to look out
me using my own head
but it was more than that
it was a kind of thinking about myself i never knew nothing about before
it felt good
good and right
i was big paul and deep and wide and when i stretched out my arms all my children could get in between
i was that wide
look like i loved them more after i got them here
or maybe i couldnt loveem proper in sweet home cause they wasnt mine to love
but when i got here when i jumped off that wagon there wasnt nobody in the world i couldnt love if i wanted to
as sethe narrates i had days
good days of free life
sethe out of habit is awake before the sun has risen
she is fully dressed
of getting up like i always did getting dressed before the sun came out and then realizing i had to decide myself what to do with the day
she sits on the bed watching the sun rise
sethe watches her children sleeping safely
days of watching my children sleep away the morning
and taking care of my baby like it was the most important thing i had to do
denver is asleep in a bassinet
sethe reaches in and picks her up
she sits by a window and breast feeds her as she hums a melody
this is the same melody we heard sethe humming in the beginning of the film
sethes melody carries itself over the following images sethe is carrying a bucket of water to the house
she sees bulgar and howard running and playing
howard tackles his brother and starts tickling him
the two boys laugh hard
sethe watches a moment of fear across her face id hear my boys laughing a laugh i aint never heard
and for a second id get scared scared someone might hear them and get mad
sethe realizes placing down the bucket then i remembered
and if they laughed that hard til it hurt that would be the only hurt they had all day
sethe sobs uncontrollably
ella teaches sethe a new stitch as she chatters on
we had us days of company
another woman teaches sethe the alphabet as sethe cradles denver and the little girl beloved crawls around her feet
baby suggs and sethe cook with a kitchen full of men and women who have come for a visit
of ease and real talk
talks about the fugitive bill dred scott or book learning
talks as quiet or as stormy as we wanted
two men get into an argument to the amusement of the women
as folks gather to hear baby suggs preach she introduces a smiling shy sethe to each one
and when everyone would gather to hear baby suggs i saw something i aint never seen before in my whole life
alone for a moment sethe looks around at the crowd of faces sethes melody stops as baby suggs stands on her rock and calls to the crowd let the children
camera follows the joyous exodus to reveal the clearing is filled with adults the entire black community of the days when sethe first arrived
the children run to their respective families with joy let your mothers hear you laugh
the children loving the game laugh hard
the adults get a kick out of it
sethe watches her boys and hides her laughter
let the grown men come
the men form a circle and dance as the crowd supports them with a clapping rhythm
a song arises from the women to accompany to dance
i want you to cry
for the living
for the dead
camera follows those women who are not singing as one by one they remember and weep
something in me knew halle was never gonna knock on our door
he was never gonna see what i saw that day
i saw what men look like
and i saw mothers for the first time
stamp paid walks up to the porch carrying a two big baskets of blackberries
his body dirty scratched and bleeding
i think it was stamp paid who started it
he walked six miles to the riverbank slid into a ravine reached through blood drawing thorns suffered mosquitoes wasps and the meanest lady spiders in the state just to bring
us those berries
he places the baskets on the porch in front of baby suggs sethe who is holding denver
and the little girl beloved
laughs what a sight you are stamp
worth it though
just one bite of these berries and you feel down right anointed
he puts one into denvers mouth
shes too little for that stamp
her bowels be soup
itll sickify her stomach
now go wash up round back
it was real nice of him
hes a good one no doubt of that
i can get three maybe four pies out of this
seems a shame just for us though
im gonna invite ella and john over
how bout if i make a couple of chickens to back it up
and thats how it began
sethe and baby suggs and ella and several other women cook
three pies became twelve
two hens became five turkeys
various images of people gathered enjoying food and drink
laughing and singing
and ella and john turned into almost ninety others
women serving up the food
older men sitting and talking as they eat
younger men playing with the children
chasing them with sheets on their backs scaring them into laughter
a man with a guitar playing a blues song and singing
while sethe enjoys her free life and most of all her children the boys running around her
denver in her arms
her little girl beloved by her side
baby suggs visits with various guests serving up the food
everybody ate so well and laughed so much
intercut images of whispers exchanged between some of the women it made them angry
women head to head with a remark or an eye of disapproval towards baby suggs as she continues cooking and feeding
the pies the turkeys
the bread pudding and shortbread
the one whole block of ice brought all the way from cincinnati it made em mad
loaves and fishes were jesuss powers
they did not belong to an ex slave who never had a white boy beat her who had her freedom bought who rented a house from white folks that hated
slavery worse than they hated slaves
it madeem furious her thoughtless generosity and un called for pride
she had over stepped
offended them by giving too much
and they left their disapproval there sos you could smell in the air the whole next day
baby suggs works the field not far from stamp paid
later on i wondered why no one warned us
why no one saw them coming and ran to to tell us
she chops at the soil over the roots of the pepper plants
she stops sensing something is wrong
she looks up at a clear blue sky
she hears the birds and the stream way down beyond the woods
she looks around and sees bulgar howard and the little girl beloved playing with loud voices by the side of the house
she sees sethe squatted in the pole beans with denver in a bushel basket beside her
the clok clok of wood being chopped causes her to look over to stamp paid helping out with the axe
she returns to her work
but something is deeply wrong
and then she hears it the sound of horses and a horse drawn wagon coming from the distance
the same sound sethe heard in her first memory of the sycamores earlier on she rises up and looks far in the distance four horsemen are riding toward them
one drives a wagon and is wearing a distinctive hat it is sethe continues working until she notices peripherally that baby suggs is standing stock still staring at something
sethe rises and looks in the same direction the four horsemen are closer
sethes face freezes in terror as
stamp paid in between chops looks up and sees the two women
then turns his face to see the men
oncoming approach of the four horsemen and hear her words theres a look whitefolks get
a look every negro learns to recognize along with his maams tit
that righteous look thats like a flag going up the pole
the righteousness that announces the whip the fist the burning the lie
long before it happens in the open
over the above speech we see in sethes expression a death of soul an instantaneous loss of hope for possibilities of joy and life
and with it an insane rage
sethe grabs denver out of the basket then scrambles after the crawling little girl beloved scooping her under her free arm
the tone of her voice cause the boys to freeze
she runs towards them grabbing one by the hand and ordering the other to run in front of them
she moves and speaks with efficient clarity
get in the shed
baby suggs and stamp paid watch helplessly the four horsemen schoolteacher his nephew a slave catcher and a sheriff arrive at the house and dismount tying their horses to the
front gate which is no longer there
the nephew scampers to the front of the house and peers in the window he listens
hearing nothing he motions for them to go round the side of the house
camera follows them as it reveals baby suggs and stamp paid standing exactly where we left them
except they are both staring at the shed out of which strange noises thuds and the frightened cries of children are heard
two black boys and several woman are coming up the road
the slave catcher motions with his rifle for them to stop and they do
the men move towards the shed meeting up with the nephew as he runs past baby suggs and stamp paid
camera moves closer towards the shed the sounds coning from within more audible now
the nephew opens the door
the four men enter
howard and bulgar are bleeding in the sawdust unconscious a bloody shovel lays near them
sethe is holding a blood soaked little girl beloved to her chest with one hand
and denver by the heels of the other
she is swinging denver toward the wall planks misses then tries again
when out of nowhere stamp paid rushes by the horrified white men and grabs denver out of sethes hand before she can swing her a second time
schoolteacher looks at the carnage
a bloody saw lies at sethes feet the weapon she used on her own childs throat
the nephew is paralyzed
what she go and do that for
what she go and do that for
baby suggs walks in
whatever amount of gods grace she could imagine and will into being vanishes with one look into that shed
you all better go on
to schoolteacher nothing here to claim i guess
look like your business is over
schoolteacher beats his hat against his thigh and spits in the shed before exiting followed by the catcher and the nephew
the sheriff speaks to sethe
ill have to take you in
no trouble now
youve done enough to last you
sethe doesnt move
you come quiet here and i wont have to tie you up
meanwhile baby suggs notices who breathes and who does not and moves straight to the boys
stamp paid extends his arm to sethe
you take my arm and gimme yours
sethe turns to him the first time shes looked into anyones eyes and sees denver in his arms
a sound escapes from her throat as though shed made a mistake
im going out here and send for a wagon
baby suggs rubs the boys hands tries to raise their eyelids spits on her dress and wipes away the blood as they slowly regain a dazed consciousness
she whispers i beg you pardon
i beg your pardon
sethe clutching the dead baby to her chest is led out of the shed by stamp paid outside a throng of black faces have gathered who stop murmuring the second
they see her
among them are ella and lady jones
they are shocked and pained
sethe is led past them to a waiting cart in total silence
baby suggs at the same time is getting the boys up the porch into the house
when denver cries in stamp paids arms she stops
lets the boys sit and runs towards the cart
sethe is seated in the cart beside the sheriff
baby suggs takes the crying denver from stamp paid
she tells the sheriff
but the child needs nursin
needs the mothers milk
then shes best come too
baby suggs approaches sethe who sees denver crying and reaches for her without letting the baby go
baby suggs resists one at a time
and you gotta clean yourself up
but sethe only wants her living child
the two women struggle as stamp paid does what he can
finally sethe wins and takes denver with her free hand undoes her dress and nurses her with a bloody breast
baby suggs breaks inside
breaks right in two although from outwards appearances she looks merely numbed by shock
a white boy makes his way through the crowd with a pair of shoes and hands them to her
mama says wednesday
she says you got to have them fixed by wednesday
baby suggs looks at him not understanding
you hear baby
she says wednesday
taking the shoes i beg your pardon
lord i beg your pardon
i sure do
sits at the kitchen table
the story told
sethe looks out the window
your love is too thick sethe
love is or it isnt
thin love aint love at all
i did stop him
i took and put my babies where theyd be safe
didnt work though did it
your boys gone you dont know where
one girl dead the other cant go farther than the yard
how did it work
they aint at sweet home
schoolteacher aint gotem
maybe theres worse
it aint my job to know whats worse
its my job to know what is and keep them away from what i know is terrible
i did that
what you did was wrong sethe
i should have gone back there
taken my babies back there
there could have been a way
some other way
you got two feet sethe
that jumped out before he had a chance to choose saying it
sethe has no response
the distance between these two people in this small room is suddenly vast
paul rises playing with his hat
not knowing how to leave
but desperately needing to
he moves to the exit and stops
you can set aside supper for me
might be late getting back
unable to look at her he turns to exit
when sethe speaks in a soft forgiving tone he stops to listen after all i told you paul d
and after telling me how many feet i have you think saying goodbye is gonna break me into pieces
paul turns to look at her and realizes she saw right through him
youre a sweet man
unable to bear it paul turns and leaves
sethe stands still fighting tears and whispers
so long paul d
sethe is scrubbing the floor with denver trailing by with dry rags
beloved enters holding a pair of ice skates what do these do
sethe and beloved look up
sethe smiles my lord
whered you dig up those
there for skating on the ice
we have another pair and half of another i think
can we try them
sethe takes the skates and looks at them with a curious lightness go ice skating
beat why not
you sure mama
strikes me that after your man leaves it might just be the wrong time to be scrubbing floors
might just be the perfect time to go ice skating
denver and beloved register hopefulness in the light of sethes attitude
sethe speaks to denver go get the shawls
and find me an old shoe for that half a pair
the girls get excited
sethe tosses the scrub brush into the pail
a bright cold winter day
beloved wears a pair of old skates
denver wears the second pair and sethe has one skate and one shoe
the two girls giggle and fall as they try to skate on the ice
helping each other up
their skirts whirling
their laughter mingled with screams of delight
sethe wearing only shoes watches them and laughs
come on maam
sethe steps onto the ice and takes a few strides and promptly falls on her rear
the girls scream with laughter
sethe tries to get up and falls their laughter infecting her as well
the girls try to help her and fall over each other in the trying
denver rises and tries an independent glide
the tip of her skate hits a bump and she falls flapping her arms wildly
all three laugh so hard they start coughing
beloved goes to denvers aid
sethe rises up on her hands and knees her laughter shaking her chest and causing her eyes to tear in the cold air
beloved helps denver and falls as well
the two girls see sethe laughing and play it up even more a few more times
until denver notices something and motions beloved to stop and look
the two glide back to sethe
her laughter has stopped but her tears have not
they gently comfortingly touch her shoulder
it is a snowy night outside the windows
sethe has laid out blankets and quilts in front of the fire in the stove
she has made sweet milk that she hands to the girls before taking her place in between them on the floor facing the fire denver on her right rests her
head on her lap
beloved sits on her left
she looks over to beloved who is staring at the fire
the illumination highlights her beauty and her profile the chin mouth forehead all copied and exaggerated in a huge shadow the fire threw on the wall
sethe cant help but stare as another thought occurs to her all i remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread
her little hands
i wouldnt know em if they slapped me
see this mark
if you cant tell me by my face look here
beloved lifts her head towards the fire at the same time she leans back to rest on a propped up pillow
in the flickering of the firelight sethe can see sethe knows before shes aware of it consciously
and just as it hits her beloved begins to hum a melody
sethe recognizes it as her own melody
i made that song up
i made it up and sang it to my children
denver lifts her head from her mothers lap to look at sethe knowing what is happening
nobody knows that song but me and my children
beloved turns to sethe i know it
sethe looks at her daughter returned
there is no gasp of astonishment no exclaim for the miraculous
for what is truly miraculous is so because the magic lies in the fact that you knew it was there for you all along
its snowy white outside
the girls are still asleep in front of the stove
but denver awakens upon hearing her mother load the stove with dry wood and begin to cook breakfast
sethe hears her wake up and turns as she beats eggs in a bowl back stiff
dont know if its the floor or the skating
could be that fall you took
that was fun
beloved snores lightly beside her should i wake her
no let her rest
she likes to see you off in the morning
ill make sure she does
but first im going make up a nice big breakfast against that cold outside
wont you be late for work
first time ill be late in nine years
no great trouble
whatever goes on out there goes on with or without me showing up on time
looks at the girls the world is in this room baby
this is all there is and all there needs to be
denver smiles but it is a cautious smile
something about her mothers statement both elates and disturbs her
a conflicted and contrite stamp paid walks through the snow down bluestone road towards
as he does he remembers his last conversation with baby suggs a fall day
leaves ankle high
stamp paid is walking when he sees baby suggs carrying a carpetbag full of repaired shoes
he crosses over to her as he gets her attention you missed the clearing meeting three saturdays running
baby suggs turns to her old friend but there is no sign of welcome or recognition
there is a noticeable change in her demeanor
she continues walking
he follows folks came
here let me carry that
he reaches for the carpetbag but baby suggs pulls it away
i got a delivery around here
name of tucker
twin chestnuts in the yard
they walk a bit until well
this saturday you coming to call or what
if i call them and they come what on earth am i going to say to them
say the word
two whitemen raking leaves look up at the sound of stamp paids voice which was too loud
so he whispers the word
what you was put here to speak
thats the last thing they took from me
but you got to do it
you got to
cant nobody call like you
you have to be there
what i have to do is get in my bed and lay down
i want to fix on something harmless in this world

what i know is what i see a nigger woman hauling shoes
he stops her before the twin chestnuts of the tucker house
we have to be steady
these things too will pass
what you looking for
im looking for what i was put here to look for the back door
they exchange a look of silence and finality
she turns and walks to the back door of the house and knocks
a moment later a white woman appears takes the carpetbag and keeps baby waiting on the back steps while she goes in for a dime
baby rests on the railing until the whitewoman returns
now stamp paid feels the need to find out whats going on inside since he caused paul to leave
he approaches the porch then the front door
he raises his hands to knock but he cant bring himself to do it
he turns to walk away then stops
he turns back and with a force of will knocks loudly upon the door
he knocks again
still no answer
he steps back trying to sense if anyones there
he turns to leave when he sees two heads in the window
denver and beloved
denver bolts away but beloved remains a moment longer looking in stamp paids eye then disappearing into the house
stamp paid is unnerved by her look
sethe enters late putting on her apron as sawyer yells what the hell you thinking girl
strolling in here this late
dont talk to me mr
dont say nothing to me this morning
you talking back to me
im telling you dont say nothing to me
sethe begins organizing her counter to make pies
you better get them pies made
sethe ignores him as she begins
sawyer is at a loss
not too sweet
you make it too sweet they dont eat it
make it the way i always do
he exits ella opens the front door for stamp paid
he looks disturbed
where you been keeping yourself
i told john must be cold if stamp stay inside
oh i been out
stamp takes off his hat and follows ella who is doing laundry in the kitchen
was over to baby suggs
what you want there

thats babys kin
i dont need no invite to look after her people
ella shrugs and continues folding wet laundry on a line behind the stove
somebody new there

i know denver
i know what i see

except her from when they was at that place baby suggs was at
he knew baby suggs

and he left when he found out what sethe did
stamp sits what you say casts a different light on it i guess
i thought stamp knows what she thought
but you didnt come here talking bout paul
you came asking about a new girl
well paul d
must know who she is
or what she is
you mind loaded with spirits
everywhere you look you see one
you know as well as i do stamp that people who die bad dont stay in the ground
stamp can not deny this
sethe is walking home to her daughters
there is a serene introverted expression on her face
as if she were detached from the world around her safe inside
we hear her thoughts beloved she my daughter
she come back to me of her own free will and i dont have to explain a thing
she had to be safe and i put her where i knew she would be
but my love was tough and she back now
she come back to me in the flesh
i wont never let her go
ill explain to her even though i dont have to
why i did it
how if i hadnt killed her she would have died and that is something i couldnt let happen to her
when i explain shell understand cause she understands everything already
and she aint even mad
when i put that headstone up i wanted to lay in there with you put your head on my shoulder and keep you warm and i would have if bulgar
and howard and denver didnt need me because my mind was homeless then
i couldnt lay down with you then
no matter how much i wanted to
i couldnt lay down nowhere in peace back then
now i can
i can sleep like the drowned have mercy
she come back to me my daughter my beloved and she beloved is my is mine
and she is mine
denver is cleaning the kitchen waiting for her mother
we hear her thoughts i swallowed her blood right along with my mothers milk
she played with me and always came to be with me whenever i needed her
me and her waited for our daddy
i love her
she never hurt me
i love my mother but i know she killed one of her own and tender as she is with me im scared of her because of it
all the time im afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own could happen again
whatever it is it comes from outside this house outside the yard
so i never leave this house and i watch over the yard so it cant happen again
i have to keep it away from my sister
ill protect beloved
cause shes mine
shes mine i am beloved and she is mine
beloved waiting for sethe to come home sees her approaching
we hear her thoughts i am not separate from her
there is no place where i stop
her face is my own and i want to be there in the place where her face is and to be looking at it too
a hot thing
in the beginning i could see her
i could not help her because the clouds were in the way
but i could see her
the shining in her ears
i look hard at her so she will know that the clouds are in the way
i cannot lose her again
i see her face which is mine
it is the face that was going to smile at me in the place where we crouched before i come up out of the blue water
sethes is the face that left me
sethes sees me in her and i see the smile
she is my face smiling at me
it is the face i lost
now we can join
a hot thing
sethe comes to the waiting beloved and smiles
she offers her hand and beloved rises
denver exits to them and smiles
she extends her hand to beloveds free hand
the three women stand astride each other arms around each others waist as they walk toward the porch
the dusk sunlight creates three shadows three figures holding each other the way sethe saw the shadows at the carnival
only they werent hers denvers and pauls
they were hers denvers and beloveds
the girls rush into the house and down the hall
then turns back to the door
a cold day
sits against the church drinking from a bottle when a voice causes him to look up howdy
stamp has his hands in his pockets moving about
you got any more newspaper in that pocket for me just a waste of time
stamp sits beside him
this is hard for me
but i got to do it
two things i got to say to you
im a take the easy one first
laughs if its hard for you might kill me dead
he drinks i come looking for you to ask your pardon
you pick any house any house where colored live
pick any one and you welcome to stay there
im apologizing cause they didnt offer to tell you
but you welcome anywhere you want to be
john and ella
miss lady jones
you aint got to sleep in no cellar and i apologize for each and every night
i did get offered one place but i just wanted to be off by myself a spell
oh thats load off
i thought everybody gone crazy
you planning to do anything about it
i got big plans
he drinks from the bottle like an angry broken man
it stabs at stamps heart to see him like this
a white man in a horse and wagon drives up the path leading to the church
he leans stops before them and leans forward hey
on his feet yes sir
im looking for a gal name of judy
works over by the slaughterhouse
said she lived on plank road
thats up a ways
you dont know her
works in the slaughterhouse
no sir i dont but i know plank road
bout a mile up thataway
paul drinks from the bottle
the white man addresses him
theres a cross up there so i guess this heres a church or used to be
seems to me like you ought to show it some respect you follow me
you right about that
thats just what i come over to talk to him about
paul offers no response
the white man clicks his tongue and drives off
stamp breathes a sigh of relief
you remember your price stamp
never found out
down to the cent
always wondered though what mrs
garner got for my brother paul f
must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for sweet home for almost two years
but then they hung my other brother paul a
up on a tree so i guess he wasnt worth the same
i wonder what was baby suggs worth
i wasnt surprised when i found out they tracked down sethe all the way to cincinatti
her price must have been higher than all of us her being property that reproduced itself without cost
no use thinking these things now
oh but we got to
how we gonna know our price in the future
how are childrens childrens children gonna know what they cost
whos gonna tell them
what are they gonna pay for us if we free
children aint gonna need to know that kind of thing
theyll know as soon as they born
cause its inside us stamp
itll be inside them
well pass it down
schoolteacher didnt just change the outside he changed the mind
and the blood
and what it carries
and what its worth
i dont believe that
there was a rooster named mister down at sweet home
last time i saw halle with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth i saw mister sitting on a tub
he loved that tub
like king on a throne
he was a hateful thing
bloody and evil
but he was better than me
mister was allowed to be and stay what he was
even if you cooked him youd be cooking a rooster named mister
but wasnt no way id ever be paul d
schoolteacher changed me
was never no beating under mr
schoolteacher changed that
why wouldnt a man run from that
why wouldnt a man not work kill starve pull out his own heart to stop feeling stead of feeling that
and it strikes me its got to be cause we were something else
and that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub
i said i had two things to say to you
i only told you one
i have to tell you the other
i dont want to know
i was there paul d
there in the yard
when she did it
when who and then paul realizes hes talking of sethe
it aint what you think
you dont know what i think
she aint crazy
she love those children
she was trying to outhurt the hurters all
she was only stamp leave off i said
i knew her when she was a girl
she scares me and i knew her when she was a girl
you aint scared of sethe
i dont believe you
she scares me
i scare me
and that girl in her house scares me
who is she
where she come from
just shot up one day from a stump
she what run you off
not what i told you bout sethe
paul thinks a moment
then tears brimming in his eyes tell me something stamp
tell me this one thing
how much is a nigger supposed to take
all he can
all he can
the sun shines on a warm april day
a day abundant with growth and renewed hope
but a shadow appears to be hovering over
it looks more worn than before
a broken window
the front door off its hinge
a front step splintered and dangerous
camera opens on the front hall and moves through the house revealing the same neglect inside broken furniture dusty floors mess and disorder
camera enters dirty pans crusted food on the table window curtains hanging askew
sethe sits hunched over asleep in a chair against the wall
she wears a dirty torn dress that hangs on her body which seems withered frailer since we last saw her
in her lap lies a clean pretty dress she was in the process of sewing when she fell asleep from fatigue
a loud crash wakes her up
followed by a loud frustrated yell
her face registers fear
she realizes where she is what time it is
and begins organizing breakfast
she places the dress neatly on the chair then grabs a cloth and wipes away the crumbs and dirty plates from supper placing them in the sink
she opens a pantry cupboard to reveal bare shelves except for a single egg and a bowl of hominy grains about full
she searches in a panic for more food anywhere opening cabinets doors places that never stored food
she realizes there is none left
denver finished dressing
she has been able to maintain a semblance of order about her person and room
but as she steps out into the second floor hallway we see the same disarray as downstairs
she passes by baby suggs old room and discovers beloved sprawled across the bed half naked
her belly is huge her body unwashed
she looks and behaves like a wild animal
a broken lamp lies on the fall pushed over by her leg as she shifted in bed
her feet overhanging the bed are still touching the bedside table where the lamp sat
she is awake now making a small hole larger in baby suggs old quilt
you shouldnt be in here
beloved jolts her head up to denver
she doesnt like being looked at unawares
what do you know about it
i sleep where i want
you best leave that quilt alone
that was grandmas quilt
beloved looks at denver then at the quilt then abruptly tears the hole apart with one strong pull
triumphant she gets out of bed and exits passing denver breakfast ready
sethe has prepared all the food that was left and placed it on one plate which she sets on the table
she stands at the stove with her back to us picking crusted pieces of food off the bottom of the pan
beloved moves straight to the chair in front of the place and begins to eat shovelling the food into her mouth
denver sees her mother covertly eating the burnt pan crumbs as she pretends to wash the dishes
sethe turns not realizing denver was there as well
their eyes meet
sethe wonders if her daughter saw her eating the pan crumbs
she smiles you hungry
knowing there must be nothing left denver answers no maam
sethe looks relieved
ill finish those
why dont you sit down
denver crosses to the dishes taking the pan from her mother
sethe nods and crosses to the table to sit down
but as she sinks into the chair beloved kicks it away you dont sit with me
baby dont be like that
you dont sit with me
i dont sit with people who leave me
dont talk like that
your mama loves you
i had another dream last night
as she eats the dead man laying on top of me and i had nothing to eat
and the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said beloved in the dark and bitch in the light
dont say those things
you forget about those dreams
you gave me the bad dreams
you left me behind
mama told you id give up my own life every minute every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby
my children my best thing
you my best thing
youre werent nice to me
you didnt smile at me
thats not true
i told you i had to get you out make you safe
sos you and me could be together on the other side forever
no one pays attention to denver
beloved flings her plate at sethe hitting her hard across the eye
the plate breaking
hold back denver im fine
you go on upstairs
ill do the cleaning up
go upstairs i said
sethes harsh tone is only for denver
denver exits the kitchen afraid to leave them alone
as she moves from the kitchen she hears i want somethin sweet
we dont have nothing sweet no more baby
not for me you dont
you dont let me eat the pies
since mama lost her job we dont have no more pies
denver walks up the white stairs
denver has straightened up her grandmothers room
cleaned away the broken pieces of the lamp
gathered the remnants of the quilt
she holds the quilt as she sits on the bed facing the headboard
she remembers baby suggs near death lying in her bed chuckles and coughs you mean i never told you about your daddy
about the bodwins who let me rent this here house while i do my shoe repairing
about your mothers feet not to mention her back
i never told you all that
a nine year old denver shakes her head
is that why you cant walk down the steps and out yonder by yourself
denver cant answer
why you never go back to lady jones and learn your letters
you liked going there i remember
seeing the other children
then all a sudden you stop
there was a boy there
said mama was a jailbird
said he could prove it
baby suggs face registers the pain of her granddaughter hurt by hurtful words
my jesus my
what people wont say
why didnt you come and ask me
denver shrugs fraid ill tell ya huh
denver looks at her come here child
denver crawls into her arms
you got to go sometime
you got to go out there by yourself sometime
but you said
you said out there there aint no
what was that word
no de fense
then what do i do
know it and go on out the yard
denver has crawled up and snuggled against the pillow in the same position as when she was nine in her grandmas arms
denver has changed into a clean pretty dress and is approaching the stairs when she passes sethes room
its door is open
she looks in
sethe stands with her back to the door cleaned up wearing her best dress and the hat she last wore to the carnival
denver smiles hopefully mama
sethe turns startled to reveal it is beloved in sethes best clothes
when beloved sees denver she smiles tauntingly and strikes a pose
i look just like her
disgusted denver exits
denver walks down the stairs entering the kitchen sethe is on her knees picking up pieces of broken plate
as she moves the skin on her knees bleeds as it scrapes against pieces too small to clean
mama let me help you
she wanted me to do it
sethe continues her work without even looking at denver
denver pauses a moment realizing she is of no use here but knowing she needs to help her mother somehow
she looks up to the kitchen where every cupboard door is open revealing empty shelves
she exits heading for the denvers hands slowly reaches towards the door lock and denver opens the door then pushes the broken screen door off its hinge
she closes the door behind her
she begins her walk from the porch to the road
the first time shes ever gone alone
not knowing what she will face beyond the perimeters of her home
she reaches bluestone road and stops
she looks in either direction and sees not a soul
she takes a breath
she begins to walk to get help
a block from the house two black men turn a corner and walk towards her
denver stops frightened not knowing what to do
the two black men pass her tipping their hats saying morning
and they walk by
denvers eyes speak the gratitude she never got her mouth open in time to reply
heartened by the encounter she picks up speed
lady jones a light skinned black woman with gray eyes and yellow woolly hair opens the door to find denver
look at you
denver manages to smile
its been so long
its so nice of you to come see me
what brings you
unfortunately denver cant manage anything beyond the smile
well never mind nobody needs a reason to visit
let me make us some tea
lady jones takes her by the hand and leads her inside
tea things sit on a table between them
denver eats whatever she can
lady jones watches with care and concern
hows your family honey
denver swallows a bite of something with some tea then i want to work miss lady
start learnin your letters again
i mean work work
well what can you do
i cant do anything but i would learn it for you if you have a little extra
my mama she doesnt feel well
i couldnt stay away from her too long cause of her condition but i could do chores in the mornings
i dont know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves
but if you all need to eat until your mothers well all you have to do is say so
we have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry
no that wont do
lady jones can sense something far more serious is going on
denver brings four eggs some rice and some tea onto the kitchen table
sethes eyes well up
she looks at denver as if for the first time
her face an expression of gratitude
suddenly sethe and denver rush out of the kitchen to see beloved running through the rooms clawing at her throat causing it to bleed
sethe and denver rush towards into the keeping room
sethe stumbles over a chair to get to beloved kneeling on the floor ripping at her own neck
denver gets her from behind and sethe grabs her from the front pinning her down trying to stop her from hurting herself
beloved screams and strikes out at sethe pulling her hair clawing at her as well
denver exits the house because she sees something unusual in the yard on the same stump that beloved first appeared sits a basket of eggs
denver crosses to it lifts it and a paper flutters to the ground
she reads it denver returns the empty basket to m
beloved eats ravenously from a bowl of white beans
sethe sits in the corner as if waiting to serve her
upon the stump sits a plate of cold rabbit meat which denver brings inside
denver is returning a bowl to grace a friendly woman
thats not my bowl
mines got a blue ring around it
would you like to come in a spell
beloved sleeps curled up on the kitchen floor after eating her mouth still dirty from the meal
sethe unwashed her hair uncombed sits in her corner chair
she is trying to mend a torn dress
denver eats a little from the latest neighborhood gift
she hears her mother mumbling to herself like a madwoman
nobodys going be doing that
nobody going be writing my daughters characteristics on the animal side
i dont care
aint laying that down
mama shes asleep
why dont you eat something
she likes this dress
but youll hurt your eyes doin it there
come sit at the table
sethe considers this
she rises cautiously then sits at the table
denver rises and gets her some food placing it before her
please mama eat something
denver is getting more and more frightened of losing her mother completely
instead of protecting beloved from sethe she must protect her mother from beloved
a white family home in a white ohio neighborhood
janey wagon a benevolent black servant woman opens the back door for denver
may i come in
what you want
i want to see mr
they brother and sister darlin
what you wantem for
im looking for work
i was thinking they might know of some
smiles you baby suggs kin aint you
i heard your mother took sick that so
well come on in
you letting in flies
the house is filled with books and pearl white lamps and glass cases filled with glistening things
denver pushes her feet into the soft blue carpet as she sits with janey
you know what
ive been here since i was fourteen and i remember like yesterday when baby suggs holy came here and sat right where you are
whiteman name of garner brought her
he and mr
bodwin were good friends
thats how she got that house you all live in
other things too
i never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me
never be another like her
i miss her
bet you do
everybody miss her
that was a good woman
well i dont know whether the bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help
hopeful ya think
they getting older now and i cant take care of em like i used to
more and more they keep asking me to sleep over night
now i dont want to quit these people but they cant have all my days and nights too
i got my own family needs me
itll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper take care of your mama during the day then earn a little something at night hows that
but what would i do at night
in case of what
in case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad i cant get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after
laughs dont ask me what whitefolks need at night
during janeys lines denver looks about the house imagining herself here at night
her eyes happen upon a statue of a black boy on his knees his head thrown back farther than a head could go his mouth wide open like a cup
and filled with money for delivery tips
on the pedestal are the words at yo they good whitefolks
cant say they aint good
i wouldnt trade them for another pair tell you that
but you come back in a few days give me a chance to leadem to it
denver nods beaming gratefully so gratefully that no words come only tears
janey reaches for denvers hand and holds it warmly what is it child
whats the trouble with sethe
denver looks at her and we know she needs to tell someone
ella has gathered all the women of the town for a meeting including lady jones janey wagon m
lucille williams grace but is it really the daughter janey
the killed one
that what she say
how they know its her
its sitting there
sleeps eats and raises hell
whipping sethe every day
the age it would have been had it lived
in the flesh
and whipping her
guess she had it coming a little
nobody got that coming
but ella you cant just up and kill your children
no and the children cant just up and kill the mama
whats fair aint necessarily right
the women listen now you all know how i felt about the whole thing
i know the rage sethe felt in that shed that day
we all do
but what i could not understand and still dont was her reaction to it
too damn complicated for a black woman in her position before god
but whatever she done i dont like the idea of past errors taking possession of the present
i dont cotton to sin moving in on a house unleashed and sassy
every day life takes enough takes all a woman has
sufficient unto the day is evil thereof and nobody needs more
nobody needs a grown up evil sitting at a table with a grudge
as long as that ghost showed itself from a ghostly place i respected it
but once it take on flesh and come into this world well the shoes on the other foot now
i dont mind a little communication between worlds
but this heres an invasion
the women agree
should we pray
then we got to get down to business
denver comes down the stairs entering the kitchen
sethe worn out looking more beaten and ravaged than before stands at the sink with an ice pick chopping up ice
denver speaks to her but she does not turn or acknowledge her
mama im going out
no response mama i got a job
working over at the bodwins at night
bodwin coming over now to pick me up on his way back from town
ill be staying there nights and coming back here for the daytime
well have some money mama
sethe continues her action as if hypnotized
denver approaches her from behind and whispers softly im going help you mama
dont you give up yet
denver touches her gently but sethe acts as if she hears and feels nothing
denver is sitting on the stump waiting for mr
bodwin when she hears thirty women gathered together walking up bluestone rd
towards singing a holy song denver is amazed by the sight as the women position themselves right in front of armed with bibles crucifixes and whatever other symbols of heavenly
power they could find
sethe is rubbing a naked beloveds forehead with a cool cloth filled with ice when the two women hear the singing
beloved rises first and moves to the window to see
the women continue singing
bodwin sitting on a wagon pulled by a horse is riding toward when he hears the singing as well
schoolteacher wore on that fateful day
the women continue singing as sethe and beloved her belly as big as a pregnant womans exit the house
the women are stunned by the sight and slightly confused by the lack of fear between the women
sethe is holding beloveds hand
beloved is smiling brightly at the beautiful singing
denver looks to her mother tears run down sethes face but she is not crying
the sound of the womens voices wash over her like a baptism
she looks to all the women faces she remembers faces she has missed although up until this moment was not conscious of missing
then sethe looks beyond the women and sees sethes expression turns to fear then rage
in her ravaged mind she thinks it is schoolteacher coming back
no hes not coming into my yard
he not taking my best thing
she releases beloveds hand and moves forward
she passes denver feeling for the ice pick in her apron
bodwin reaches the thirty women who separate him from beloved watches from the house watches sethe attack and defend with the ice pick
and something within her is resolved
for a moment we see a calm spirit instead of a wild animal
and a tear upon her face
then just as quickly she sprints around the side of the house and disappears from view
the women try to help sethe as denver cries for her mother
bodwin looks on stunned
is on his way to work when he sees a poised confident denver walking in the opposite direction
she spots him and smiles good morning paul d
paul is clearly impressed by the sight of her
well is it now
how you getting along
dont pay to complain
you on your way home
got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory
figure between that and my night work at the bodwins i might be able to put something away for me and mama
they treating you right over at the bodwins

miss bodwin she teach me stuff
she says i might go to oberlin
shes experimenting on me
paul smiles wanting to warn her but deciding not to spoil the possibilities that lay before her
your mother all right
not a bit all right
hasnt gotten out of bed since that day
you think i should stop by
think shed welcome it
i dont know
i think ive lost my mother paul d
you know beloved
she gone like they say
havent seen her since that day
ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but
i dont think so
mama thinks shes gone for good
says she can feel it
you think she sure nough your sister
at other times i think she was
but who would know that better than you
i mean you sure nough you her
she levels her eyes at him and he knows what she means
well if you want my opinion
i have my own
yes sir well good luck with the job
they pass each other until denver turns back and paul d
you dont have to stay way but be careful how you talk to my mama hear
paul watches her walk away
he watches as a young black man runs towards her shouting hey miss denver
he watches as the two young people the future walk together
paul enters the house and hears humming
he walks towards the keeping room whose door is ajar sethe lies in bed with the remnants of baby suggs quilt over her as she hums her melody and looks
out of the window
turns to him paul d
she looks like shes dying
he approaches her
no you looking good
whats this i hear about you not getting out of bed
no response i saw denver
she tell you
she comes in the daytime
she still with me my denver
nervous you got to get up from here girl
im tired paul
i have to rest a while
getting upset shouts dont you die on me
this is baby suggs quilt
is that what you planning
oh i dont have no plans
no plans at all
look denver be here in the day
i be here in the night
im a take care of you you hear
sethe looks at him a long look and sees in him that thing that blessedness that makes him the kind of man who can walk into a house and make
women cry make women tell him things they could only tell each other
cries she left me
shes gone again
me and you we got more yesterday than anybody
we need some kind of tomorrow
she was my best thing
paul leans down and takes her hand entwining his fingers into hers
you your best thing sethe
sethe smiles with tears in her eyes looking almost surprised me
a beautiful sunny day
the clearing is full
everyone looks bright and hopeful
dressed in bright summer clothes
a robust baby suggs is on her rock giving her best call as camera pans the crowd of faces eager to believe
the only grace we can have is the grace we can imagine
if you cannot see it you will not have it
here in this place we are flesh
flesh that weeps laughs dances on bare feet in the grass
love it hard
yonder they do not love your flesh
they despise it
they flay it
o my people they do not love your hands
those they only use tie bind chop off and leave empty love your hands
raise them up and kiss them
touch others with them put them together stroke them on your face cause they dont love that either
you got to love it
yonder out there they aint in love with your moth
they will see it broken and break it again
what you say out of it they will not heed
what you scream from it they do not hear
no they dont love your mother
you got to love it
and the feet that need to rest and to dance
the backs that needs support
the shoulders that need arms strong arms im telling you
o my people out yonder they dont love your neck unnoosed and straight
so love your neck put a hand on it grace it stroke it and hold it up
love all your inside parts love em
and the beating heart love that too
more than eyes or feet
more than lungs that have yet to draw free air love your heart
for this is the prize
and with her twisted broken old body baby suggs begins to and the crowd gives her music singing in four part harmony
camera pans the crowd of beautiful faces singing together
among the crowd we see familiar faces
we stamp paid ella john and lady jones
