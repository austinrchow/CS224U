href b b manhunter screenplay by michael mann july the highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men imposed in front of it
the beach is white sand
jack crawford mid forties large came down from washington
his suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled up white sleeves says city not florida keys
will graham late thirties in a faded hawaiian number and sun bleached vio let shorts belongs
crawford drinks from a glass of iced tea
then i should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work
you dont want to talk about it here
i dont want to talk about it anywhere
beat if you brought pictures leave them in the briefcase
molly and kevin will be back soon
how much do you know
what was in the miami herald and the times
eighty six so far
he smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces
beat none of them knew that what else did you keep out of the papers
blond right handed really strong wears a size eleven shoe
the prints are all smooth gloves
hes on a full moon cycle
his blood is ab positive
somebody hurt him
typed him from semen
hes a secretor
crawford takes a sip of the iced tea and looks at graham
graham flips his cigarette into the surf
you saw this in the papers
the second one was all over tv
did you ever think about givin me a call
the bureau already has the best lab
plus you have bloom at the university of chicago
and i got you down here fixing fuckin boat motors
you dont need me
i wouldnt be useful to you anymore jack
last two like this we had you caught
that was three years ago
and by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing
thats not entirely true will
its the way you think
i think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way i think
beat i came down here to get away from all that
you look all right now
i am all right
crawford pulls two pictures from his shirt pocket
he keeps them face down
they draw at will
crawford knows this
if you cant look anymore i understand
as long as theyre dead
these are all dead will
if we expected gory crime photos these are not them
two snapshots a woman followed by three children and a duck carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond
a second family behind a birthday cake at a table
theyre all smiling
looks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds
then he puts them down and looks along the beach
kevin lanky and tall at eleven hunkers down at the waters edge yards away examining something in the sand
molly suntanned blonde and sensuous at thirty stands watching the two men her hand on her hip
waves careen around her ankles
her body language openly states hostility
its towards crawford
lets talk after dinner
stay and eat
ill come back later
i got messages at the holiday inn to collect molly starts walking forward
are doing dishes
graham wipes while molly washes
he stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here
what did he want
he asked how you are
and you said
i said you are fine he should leave you the hell alone
im a forensic specialist molly
youve seen my diploma
sarcastic i got a diploma and everything
you mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma
heat you are open and easy now
it took you a lot of work to get to that
we have it good dont we
all the things that happened to you before make you know that
there is a soft pleading in her voice
what the hell can i do
after a pause what youve already decided
youre not really asking
if i were
facing him stay here with me
heat thats selfish huh
touches the side of her face i dont care
beat hell never see me or know my name
if we find him the police will have to take him down
not me im just looking at evidence
as he puts an arm around molly
is working in the sand
behind him graham is stapling chicken wire to two foot high fence posts
will it keep them out
how many turtle eggs you think are in here
in this hatchery
forty to fifty
crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea huh
yeah but not now
these will all make it
on the porch swing
beyond them at the waters edge graham nothing to each other the fence
crawford and molly say or a while
then finally whatever i say youll take him away wont you
i have to
youre his friend jack
why cant you leave him alone
because its his bad luck to be special
he thinks you want him to look at evidence
nobodys better with evidence
but he has the other thing too
he doesnt like that part of it
you wouldnt like it either if you had it
there is a pause between them
molly lights a cigarette
crawford leans forward resting his thick pale forearms on his knees
talking about like you dont like me very much do you
beat i dont like people who park in the handicapped zone
ill try to keep him as far away from it as i can
small poplars line the curb
the sidewalks are wet
they are drying in splotches
the street is deserted
the front walk vertically bisects the frame
an atlanta police department car pulls to the curb and stops
the door opens lighting the interior and will graham starts out the passenger side
distant thanks for the lift
ill come inside with you if you like but mr
crawford said youd probably want to be alone
theres a vtr setup waiting in your hotel room that you asked for they transferred the home movies of both families once half inch vhs
getting out thanks
graham exits the car and walks towards us
we pan around as he moves through extreme closeup and see the leeds family house with all of the atlanta police department crime scene postings graham doesnt enter the front
be walks around the side
three big sliding glass doors
the center one has been re placed with plywood
a flashlights beam starts playing through the bushes in the side yard
then the light appears and blasts in the lens
it lights lots of dishes in the sink
the dark kitchen looks like anybodys kitchen
the house feels occupied
the leeds possessions have been undisturbed
we hear the lock click and the door slide open as graham enters
its like hes a burglar
walk through the kitchen as if he knows where he is going
a thermostat clicks and air conditioning comes on loudly
grahams feet pass our of frame
the carpet is dark
we hear grahams footsteps up the stairs
then his feet enter the frame and a flash light beam hits the carpet
it dwells on a couple of dark stains
track with grahams feet to the entry to the master bedroom
the bedroom is dark
we see nothing
grahams hand enters
he hits the light switch
screams at us from the walls
doesnt visibly react
moves into the room
the bloodstains are extensive
half the walls look like a monochromatic jackson pollock
the mirrors are smashed
taped outlines on the mattress indi cate where the bodies had been found
graham opens the file he carries containing autopsy lab and crime reports
standing alone in the middle of the master bedroom
the crime scene the disarray the big splashes of arterial blood on the walls the smashed mirrors taped outlines or bodies is a testament to a violence that is pornographic
graham pulls out a tape recorder and starts dictating his own notes thumbing through various reports for reference
intruder entered through kitchen sliding door
probably a glass cutter
why didnt he care that he left ab saliva on the glass
it was hot out that night
inside the house must have been pleasantly cool to him
beat the intruder cut charles leeds throat as he lay asleep beside mrs
he shot mrs
leeds as she was rising
bullet entered the right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine but she died of strangulation
increase of serotonin and free histimine levels in the gunshot wound indicates
she lived at least five minutes after she was shot
all her other injuries were post mortem
beat then he went toward the childrens room
beat direction and velocity of blood stains on the east wall indicate arterial spray
with his throat cut mr
leeds still tried to fight
because the intruder was moving to the childrens room
beat in the childrens room the intruder shot the first boy in bed
second boy was found in bed but dustballs indicate he was dragged out from under his bed to be shot
beat profusion of bloodstains and matted sliding marks on hall carpet and west wall of master bedroom remain unexplained
as does superficial ligature mark around mr
leeds chest believed to be post mortem
what did the killer do with them after they were dead
and before he put the boys back in their beds
we see nothing
light comes on
he rests his hands on the sides of the sink
he turns on the water
he pops two pills cups his hands under the faucet and drinks
he looks at himself in the mirror
be is breathing normally
over his shoulder he sees
still hanging on a towel railing over the bathtub
graham is staring at the normal domesticity of a family bathroom
he doesnt let it unnerve him
the window opens and graham climbs onto the porch roof and sits on the gritty shingles
were looking for a distressed reaction
there is none
graham is clamped down
beyond him the lights of atlanta and the stars are brilliant
more brilliant than they ought to be
the delta aquirid meteor showers at its maximum this is not a normal image
he takes out his tape recorder again
theres a wicker dog bed on the back porch
theres a doghouse in the back yard
wheres the dog
hold on graham
graham riding up with two half drunk conventioneers with big hi badges
one conventioneer is looking over at the lobby below
a good looking woman in a floral dress walks underneath them
graham is leaning against the glass
like to rip me off a piece of that
fuck her til her nose bleeds
the other cracks up
snaps alert and stares at conventioneer
sips his gin and tonic senses grahams stare
he smiles what the fuck are you lookin at
graham looks away
the elevator stops
the door opens
conventioneer drags conventioneer
conventioneer l being pulled out of elevator what are you a faggot
both conventioneers laugh as they walk down the hall
conventioneer wiggles his fat hips and apes a limp wrist graham looks away
we are seeing a videotape transfer of the leeds family home movie
leeds and mrs
leeds are behind the table while the youngest boy is in the center
his brother sits next to him
the birthday cake has eleven candles on it
all are mouthing silently happy birthday to you happy birth day to you
leeds has her arms crossed underneath her breasts
shes a young mother sensual and warm
the camera must be on a tripod because mr
leeds runs into the frame tousles his sons hair and kisses his wifes cheek
he has thinning hair
hes a big man
he looks like a nice guy
he darts out of the frame back to the camera
they finish singing
the youngest leeds boy blows out the candles
leeds holds up for the camera a large yellow envelope that says follow the ribbon
a big yellow ribbon is attached to the envelope
the camera pans right as the youngest leeds boy starts to follow the ribbon
the image suddenly ours out
has hit the stop button
he picks up a measured field sketch of the master bedroom
the bloodstains are represented in outline
three are along the left wall
the arterial splashes from mr
leeds are on the right wall
leeds body positions are indicated on the king size mat tress
into the tape recorder when they were dead except possibly mrs
leeds he smashed the mirrors and began selecting shards that he used later on mrs
what did he do in the interval
struggling with mr
leeds and killing the others would take less than a minute
beat three bloodstains on the east wall not from mr
leeds arterial spray
what did killer do after they were dead
graham cant go any further
he is frustrated
he picks up the phone and dials
then into phone molly
is that you
ill call you tomorrow sweetheart
go back to sleep
beat i love you
i love you too will
will hangs up the phone
he reaches over and punches play on the vtr
vtr backs up starts to play and we see the image of mrs
leeds again in the home movie they follow the yellow rib bon down the stairs to a bicycle
its rain ing outside
the eleven year old leeds boy is ecstatic
into tape recorder you moved the kids after you killed them didnt you
did you arrange them for your performance with mrs
leeds on their bed
did you tie mr
leeds sitting up in bed
thats the postmortem ligature on his chest
did you make them your audience
did you open their eyes
there is something you cant afford for me to know about
leeds was lovely wasnt she
it was maddening to have to wear gloves when you touched her wasnt it
beat there was talcum powder on her leg
there was no talcum powder in the bathroom
beat the powder they found came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off to touch her
you took off your glove to touch her
didnt you you son of a bitch
you touched her with your bare hands
and then you put the gloves back an
and you wiped her down
while your gloves were off
shouts snakes out and hits the stop button on the vtr
is picked up and we move with it to his face
graham punches numbers into the phone
he clamps dawn again
he is cold calm
jack this is graham
is price still in latent prints
hes working on the single print index
what time is it
get him to atlanta
you said the guy down here is good
he is good
bur not as good as price
what do you want to do
leeds fingernails and toenails
i think he took off his gloves jack
heat and dust all the corneas of all their eyes
down the corridor
our people swear he wore surgeons gloves the whole time
they dusted everything
the report didnt mention nails and eyes
why do you think he took his gloves off
leeds was a good looking woman
id want to touch her skin in an intimate situation wouldnt you
sudden distaste intimate
they had privacy
beat everybody else was dead
springfield looks at graham
springfield needs answers not voodoo
then they enter the squad room
twenty detectives sit at desks
graham and crawford move to the back of the class
house to house interviews will be extended four additional blocks
r i has loaned us two clerks to help cross matching airline reservations between birmingham last month and between atlanta now
dominique princi chief medical examiner for fulton county walks to the front and stands under a drawing of teeth
he holds up a dental cast
this is what the subjects teeth look like
the smithsonian in washington reconstructed them from the impressions we took of bite marks off the leeds woman here and off the jacobi woman last month in birmingham
beat as you can see he has pegged lateral incisors the teeth here and here
the teeth look like teeth from a small bear
investigator graham has worked this kind of thing before
can you add anything
graham doesnt like talking in public
he stutters and starts to say something
cant hear you
can you come up to the front
graham walks to the front of the room
he may have a history of biting barroom fights or child abuse
he only bit women so far right
thats all we know about
beat most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center
a suck mark
so for him biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior
beat you could try emergency room personnel treatment for bite wounds
i know thats pretty thin
beat he bites a lot
sex murder three
he likes to bite
six bad ones in mrs
eight in mrs
beat thats all i have
graham sits down
vice and narcotics take the k y cowboys and the leather bars
marcus and whitman heads up at the funeral
the rest of you your assignments are on the sheet
they start to rise
one more thing ive heard officers referring to the killer as the tooth fairy
on laughter yeah yeah but i dont want to hear that in public or internal memoranda
detectives file out
crawford and graham remain
springfield crosses to them and they wait for all the other detectives to leave
to crawford we dont have shit and we know it
princi joins them
to graham the commissioner was saying you were the one that caught dr
lecter three years ago
beat he killed nine people didnt he
nine that we know of
two didnt die
what happened to them
ones on the respirator at a hospital in baltimore
the other is in a private mental hospital in denver
what did the psychologists say was wrong with lecter
psychologists call him a sociopath
they dont know what else to call him
what would you call him
graham doesnt answer
i call him a monster
i understand he cut you pretty good
cold right turn what about the dog
its at the vets
the kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen
icepick or an awl
was the dog wearing a collar with the leeds name on it
did the jacobis in birmingham have a dog
alert a cat
we found a litter box downstairs but not the cat
neighbors are watching for it
why dont you get birmingham p
a methane probe out of d
and have them cover the backyard
maybe the cats dead and the kids buried it
crawford starts to move
the phone rings
waits lemme put you on the speaker phone
who am i talking to
jimmie its me jack crawford and you got will graham here
i got a partial with a tented arch thats probably a thumb print and a fragment of a palm
came off the oldest kids left eye
it stood out against an eight ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound
can you make an identification off it
the palm came off the nail of mrs
leeds left big toe
i want to work these up in my own darkroom
ill fax the prints down to you this afternoon
thought graham was ridiculous
now his expression is very changed
senses springfields staring at him
grahams face is blank
springfield shaking crawfords hand watches graham all the way to the door
atlanta police headquarters graham s crawford day coming down the stairs
news media are all over springfield the commissioner the mayors p
officer in the b
no body recognizes crawford and graham except one short man who separates himself from the pack and darts up to them
he is lounds
he starts chasing behind them
i covered the lecter case for the tattler
i did the paperback
walking down the stairs
his face is locked like a steel trap
hes repressing something powerful
running on behind them when did they call you in will
what have you got
graham wont answer him
they are on the sidewalk by now
lounds give it a rest
come on graham
talk to me
graham and crawford are moving dawn the sidewalk now
crawford tries to block lounds
lounds moves around him dogging graham how does this guy compare with lecter
how does he do them
right now he makes the mistake of grabbing grahams arm to turn him around
grabs lounds by the labels kicks his legs out from under him and throws him over the hood of a car upside down
the impact stars the windshield lounds is scared to death
the violence totally surprises us
grahams face is inches from lounds
very low keep the fuck away from me
crawford is pulling on graham
he cant budge him
graham lets go
down the sidewalk and lounds who slides off the car hood and lands on all fours
over his shoulder to lounds get the hell away from here lounds
graham is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee
crawford is looking at him
finally snuck in the hospital while i was sedated flipped back the sheets and shot pictures
the only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls
graham looks away
then he lights another cigarette
back to business atlanta and birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders
five will get you ten they dont come up with an identification
jimmie may in the finder program
if hes ever been printed and in his index
say weve arrested a good suspect
you walk in and see him
what is there about him that doesnt surprise you
i dont know jack
hes got no face for me
you can tell something about him or we wouldnt have found the finger print
dont expect too much from me jack all right
pause well get him one way or the other
whats one way
we find an event that connects both families
same vacation hotel same hospital different times
then we check employees and come up with a male nurse hairdresser whatever
beat if we find out how he found them then well find him
were running it through the computers now
so far theres no event or service that doubles back into both families
plus they were big consumers snowmobiles fishing trips scuba videogames lots of routine medical and dental
its a haystack
beat whats the other
he makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time
no other possibilities
you think im gonna spot him across a crowded room
thats ezio pinza youre thinking about
beat the tooth fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky
he wont stop
because he has a genuine taste for it jack
you do know something about him
long stare at crawford then im going to see lecter
crawfords cup of coffee stops in front of his mouth for christs sake why
matter of fact to recover the mind set
in the middle of packing
then the phone rings
where are you
at the store
you doin some good
none youd notice
and very erotic
tell me about yourself
that or the day to day
laughs lets keep it the day to day stuff
beat hows kevin
he had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in
the dogs dug them up
tell me what youre doing
eating junk food
beat they dont have a lock on anything molly
theres not enough information
or i havent done enough with it
will you be in atlanta for a while
im not buggin you about coming home i just wondered
z dont know
im goin up to baltimore this afternoon
to do what
i have to see somebody
there is a silence
graham does not want to tell her that he is going to see lecter
molly stays cool she doesnt pursue it
im thinking about painting the kitchen
what color do you like will
are you there
coming back yeah
yellow lets paint it yellow
yellows a bad color for me
ill look green at breakfast
blue is cold
hey goddamn it paint it shit brown for all i care
beat look im sorry
when i come home well go to the paint store together and get some chips and
molly interrupts will i dont know why im talking about this stuff
beat i called to tell you i love you and i miss you
and you are doing the right thing
its costing you too
and i know that
and im here
ill be here whenever you come home
or ill meet you anywhere
thats what i called to say
graham holds the phone close to him
as if it were a part of molly herself
molly dear molly
go to bed now baby
i love you
slowly hangs up the phone
he sits round shouldered on the bed
all over the room are clothes out of drawers and closets videotapes and files the mess of being only half packed
bloom called me yesterday mr
or should i call you dr
im not a doctor
beat i need to see lecter in as much privacy as possible
graham sits in front of his desk in a chair
he appears repressed clamped down
chilton is a sincere chief of staff but not gifted
lecter will stay in his room
that is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints
one wall of his room is a double barrier
i will have a chair put just outside
i might have to show him some material that could stimulate him
as long as its on soft paper
you may pause find this curious
he pulls an ekg tape from a drawer and points to the spiky lines
here lecters resting on the examining table getting an electrocardiogram
complained of chest pains
pulse seventy two
here he grabs the nurses head and pulls her down to him
here hes subdued by the attendant and lecters shoulder is dislocated
do you notice the strange thing
pause his pulse never got over eighty five
even when he tore into her face
chilton looks over at graham perhaps expecting a
there is nothing to read in grahams face
it is a blank
the consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of dr
hannibal lecter is you mr
can you tell me anything about him
when you saw dr
lecktors murders their style so to speak were you able to reconstruct his fantasies
and did that help you identify him
looks at graham
chilton has seen a lot of hostility
right now hes seeing some more
stands i want to see lecktor now
we hear three locks opening
the door opens
an attendant behind graham closes the door and we hear the bolts lock again
as graham is walking towards us we widen and track in
it makes the b
disorienting as we get closer to grahams face
the camera drops as graham sits in a single chair
we havent yet seen what graham looks at
now a x cage
in the center of the bars separating graham from the occupant is a three foot square perspex sheet
the occupant cant get at someone sitting in front of him
in the perspex square is a letter passing drawer
in the cell laying on his bunk is dr
he appears to be asleep
his back is to graham
he has not stirred
then thats the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago
i keep getting it for christmas
turns to us
his small eyes drill into grahams brain
lecktors attitude is professionally psychiatric as if graham is the patient
did you get my card
i got it
struggle will be to keep locked down inside himself all his emotional reactions
and how is officer stuart
the one who was the first to see my basement
stuart is fine
emotional problems i hear
he was a very promising young officer
do you ever have any problems will
of course you dont
pause im glad you came
my callers are all professional
clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere
second raters the lot
bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of clinical psychiatry
very interesting even to a layman
lecktor rolls around and examines the term layman in his head
then a layman
so many experts on government grants
and you say youre a layman
but it was you who caught me wasnt it will
do you know how you did it youve read the transcript
its all there
no its not
do you know how you did it will
its in the transcript
what does it matter now
smiles it doesnt matter to me will
i want you to help me dr
yes i thought so
its about atlanta and birmingham
you read about it im sure
in the papers
i dont rear out the articles
laughs i wouldnt want them to think i was dwelling on anything morbid
you want to know how hes choosing them dont you
i thought you would have some ideas
why should i tell you
there are things you dont have
i could speak to the chief of staff
gruesome isnt he
he fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle
laugh he actually tries to give me a thematic and apperception test
sat there waiting for mf to come up
its a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground
i was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation
i laughed in his face
beat never mind its boring
youll get to see the file on this case
and theres another reason
i thought you might be curious to find our if youre smarter than the person im looking for
then by implication you think that you are smarter than me since you caught me
i knew that im nor smarter than you are
then how did you catch me will
you had disadvantages
youre very tan will
graham does not answer if anything happens there is a tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to lecktor
your hands are rough
they dont look like a cop s hands anymore
that shaving lotion is something a child would select
it has a ship on the bottle doesnt it
lecktors eyes look as if theyre drilling into grahams head trying to find out things
trying to find a way to hurt graham
hes very threatening
then relaxes dont think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity
i dont think ill persuade you
youll do it or you wont
bloom is working an it anyway and hes the best
interrupts do you have the file with you yes
let me have them and i might consider it
do you dream much will
good bye dr
you havent threatened to take away my books yet
graham gets up and starts to walk away
let me have the file
then ill tell you what i think
graham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant
then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding tray
lecktor pulls it through
sits in the chair
he wants a cigarette
he doesnt take one
and he watches
what he sees
toothbrush mirror sink sryrofoam cups soft paper jour nals t shirts neatly stacked hospital pads sneakers with no shoelaces the wall seatless toilet bowl etc etc all the objects are
brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light
their edges are sharper and more defined than normal
the shadows of the bars make hard edged stripes
it is a high resolution highly brilliant sec of images
it feels like a hyper perception of reality a super realism perceived by the mind of graham
it is interrupted when there is a very shy boy will
snaps back to the present looks at lecktor
what were the yards like
big backyards fences some hedges why
because my dear will if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon he might go outside and look at it
have you seen blood in moonlight will
it appears quite black
if one were nude it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing
its not interesting
you thought of it before
id considered it
you came here to look at me will
to get the old scent again didnt you
i want your opinion
i dont have one right now
when you do have one id like to hear it
may i keep the file
i havent decided yet
ill study it will
when you get more files id like to see them too
you can call me
when i have to call my lawyer they bring me a telephone
would you like to give me your home number
do you know how you caught me will
you can leave messages for me at the number on the file
graham bangs on the door
locks are starting to be unlocked
graham cant wait to get out of here
he wants the locks to get unlocked faster
do you know how you caught me
the door is now open
graham fights down the impulse to run through
as graham controlled steps out what he hears is the reason you caught me will is were just alike
you want the scent
the door slams shut on lecktor
walks down the corridor
hes very stiff
hes walking towards the outside door
the door is a rectangle of white light that sends daggers of brilliance across the highly polished institutions floor
graham walks for the light
the door slams open and graham comes out into daylight and air
the air is tactile to him
he can almost feel the motes of dust and light that swim freely
is dappled with pointillist points of color a spectral breakup
as it returns to a normal green
he stands in front of the sign on the building chesapeake state hospital for the criminally insane
he leans against the railing and breathes clean air
the image is flattened in a long lens
we hear a click
it focuses and de focuses
is photographing graham with a nikon and a mm questar reflector
be puts the camera to his eye again and hits the button
the motor drive knocks off three shots
the quadrants display home movies at six times normal speed an old couple men a baby and a family
the fam ily quadrant slows to normal
we tighten in on it
we will come to know these people as the shermans
an year old boy a i year old girl mr
sherman and mrs
a handmade sign says the new house swimming pool
sherman has brown hair
she wears a bikini
she has a nice body
shes sensuous and tan in her thirties
she dives into the pool
the next shot water
out of the water surfaces mrs
she shakes her head and water sprays off her hair
a couple drops hit the lens and diffuse a small area of the image
sherman puts her hands on the side of the pool and shoves down to hoist herself out
her breasts are glis tening
her teeth are white
she smiles at the camera
whoever controls the console puts mrs
sherman in reverse
it runs forward again
shermans glistening body coming our of the water
beyond is the screen
the man at the console is francis dollarhyde
he has a weightlifters body
we dont see his face
black goggles with red lenses are on the console
he puts them on and watches mrs
it slams open
dollarhyde enters and walks through the dim green light past the developers in his black goggles with red lenses
thousands of feet of negative move through the tank on rollers
dollarhyde walks past the baths
we track with him to the door
as he reaches the next door
enters and we track with him past film snaking across pul leys and rollers through the drying cabinets
as dollarhyde passes the dryers
in the brilliant aluminum and peach cafeteria gets coffee
a newspapers under his arm
as he waits to pay eileen approaches
she too wears goggles but on a lanyard around her neck
shes petite fragile
dollarhyde towers over her
his face bears the scars of a z plast procedure to fix a harelip and cleft palate
immediately in characteristic gesture he curls his right hand under his nose to hide his z plast scars
bill told me to tell you there was a variation in the gamma of the number three developer
but he caught it
on the densitometer it came out within tolerances
thank you eileen
graciously dollarhyde lets her go first and then he crosses to an empty table
he opens his newspaper
where the fabric stretches between his shoulder blades and past his cheap haircuts line at the nape of his neck into his left shoulder to reveal hes reading the national
its about will graham with a freddie lounds byline
the only words we catch are fbi manhunter consults fiend who tried to kill him by freddie lounds
we also catch the tooth fairy psychopathic slayer of entire families in birmingham and atlanta
takes off the black goggles with red lenses
his eyes are white violet
he turns the page
its the one lounds took after graham was slashed by lecktor
its a black and white square image of a sleeping man with a myriad of tubes running into his stomach and a temporary colostomy bag
a black square is imposed over his genitals
the caption reads federal manhunter will graham recover ing from near fatal slashing by hannibal the cannibal lecktor
in newsprint the one lounds took at the chesapeake hospi tal
the half tone dots comorising the image are visible
dollarhydes massive finger slides across the image brush ing it sensitively
it works its way to grahams face and the finger stops and blots it out
receives a telephone
the attendant who brought it waits
thank you so much
ill call you when im finished
then he leaves
lecktor is allowed to call his attorney in privacy
picks up the phone and punches in his number

thank you very much
on the phone as lecktor hangs up
squeezed into a narrow seat
he sits on the aisle
next to him is a seven year old girl at the window her mother
he opens and reads a telex in yellow envelope birmingham p
clears the trays
contorts his body to pull his briefcase from under the seat in front
he extracts the leeds and jacobi files
from each he takes a snapshot of a happy family picture and paperclips them to the front of the files
he stands them on the dinner tray and stares at them
slowly zoom in to the jacobi family
as we get closer and closer to mrs
jacobi in a bikini her face abstracts into pointillist dots of color
moves down to us
approaches in slow motion raising a bag of shrimp and a six pack of dos equis
guiding the engine down wears faded violet shorts and no shirt
we see a huge circular scar ending in a hook on his abdomen as the engine lands
reverb distant block her off mitch
graham waves to molly
on the dock
the hot sun turns the water a brilliant aqua and silver
grahams tan body in the violet shorts on the silver wood
molly reaches in the bag for another shrimp
graham looks at her
as she rips the head off the shrimp
the warm mouth her shiny teeth look like a pepsodent commercial
as the shrimp is ripped apart we see in horror
we hear screaming coming from a differ ent place as we
the child next to graham is screaming
the mother is shouting at him
graham is confused stunned
he doesnt know whats wrong
he looks around
the stewardess is handling things on his tray in front of him
the file has spilled open
crime photos of the leeds and jacobi families with mirrors in their eyes and the almost separated head of mr
jacobi glaring at a weird angle the pornography of it all are spilled across grahams tray and in his lap
mumbles apologies scrambles to collect crime photos
the mother wants her seat changed
graham is excruciatingly embarrassed clumsily shoving them back into their files
we move into the knob
it starts to turn
sud denly door slams open revealing real estate agent geehan and graham it was last thursday
this couple from duluth
i had them down to the short strokes talking mortgages i mean that man could have written a check for the whole goddamn place
im figuring geehan you lucky sonofabitch you gonna unload this turkey
beat then the squad car rolls up
they ask a coupla questions
the good officers give them the whole fuckin guided tour
who was laying where
where all the blood sprayed
beat off they go in their sedan deville the hell out of here
have any single men asked to look at it
havent asked me
beat took four coats of interior latex five in places
pause you can drop that key in the mailbox
you dont have to come back by do you
the door closes with a slam
in the empty white living room
graham walks out of frame
bare floors and dead air
his footsteps echo in the empty house
an image from bill owens suburbia
a family house
no different than any other family house around
but it is somehow sinister in its vacancy
it ought to be littered with bicycles and wagons the signs and symbols of suburban normalcy
track left to reveal the back of graham staring at the house from across the street
in a different position staring at the rear of the house from a neighbors bushes
we dont know why graham is staring at the jacobi house from different vantage points
graham looking at the house from the third vantage point
and turned earth where the cat was found
starts backing up and we move with him
he looks over his shoulder at us and keeps walking backwards
trees enter the frame on the left and right
he stumbles through underbrush into a dry streambed
he backs up a slope on the other side and finds himself in some trees
there are three
graham looks around
now obscure the jacobi house
something glints right
at the base of one elm tree
a ring tab from a soft drink can is half buried in leaves
grahams fingers move leaves aside
looks slowly up the tree trunk
wedged into the first strong limb its from the instep of a boot
hangs his coat on the branch of a neighboring tree and climbs the far side of the elm
his head and his cheek raise through limbs
his eye is six inches away when he finds a soft drink can wedged between limb and trunk
i love it
sweet jesus yes come on can
he photographs its placement with the camera on his belt bracketing exposures
then he tears a small branch and uses it to put the can in an evidence bag
graham climbs higher until his foot is level to where he saw the mud
he looks to his left
something he sees stops him cold
is carved in the wood
photographs this as well as a branch thats been trimmed by a cutting tool
then he looks
a perfect view
high in the tree leans back against the trunk
re seems frozen
then mumbling to himself after you killed the cat and threw it into the yard my man you climbed up hero and waited
you used a cutting tool on these branches so you could see
you watched the children and passed the time whittling and dreaming
beat when night came you saw them passing their bright windows and you watched the shades go down and you saw the lights go out one by one
and after a while you climbed down and you went in to them didnt you
shouts beat thats why you like houses with big yards the easier to see them geehan showing some new candidates around the house
its a young couple and they look interested
they dont build houses this way anymore solid lath and plaster construction
none of your drywall stuff and aluminum studs here
no sirree bob
i like it hon
lets go to your office and see if we can work out some terms
you goin love this house
geehans got a sale
hes at the front door
he opens it
the door is opened by geehan and his big smile shepherding his customers to be out the front door
the smile falls off geehans face
the young buyers look quizzically
has deflated against the doorframe
with flashers going are converging onto the scene
will graham is at the nearest police car talking on a cellular phone
im sending the can to jimmie price to dust for prints
fast beat i need bowman in documents to fall on this carving
then i need the firearms and toolmarks section out here on the severed branch
i need to know what kind of cutting tool he used
on phone to graham
is it weird
if the documents section cant do it
ill send it up to langley
did price get anywhere with the single prints off the leeds
as another line on crawfords phone rings we pull back to his secretary sarahs area
fading up fading down special agent crawfords no
the killers not in office
the single print index
he must never have been printed
tighten on sarah
we dont hear whats said to her
graham is not in the office bur let me
beat wait ill be glad to

she holds the receiver as though it had died in her hand and crosses into crawfords office
to graham bur if we find him the print as evidence will get a conviction hold on
he asked for will
he said he might call back tonight
i tried to hold him
he said tell graham broken mirrors
to graham will
get right back here
he just called
who did he ask for
its now sunset out the window
both men are tense
on crawfords desk are two new telephones and a tape recorder
also in the room are sarah and dr
sidney bloom a forensic psychologist
food wrappings and styrofoam coffee cups litter his desk
bloom only ate half his pastrami on rye anybody want the rest of the cholesterol special
so how do i play him sidney
tell him most people dont have the intellectual capacity to understand what has happened that sort of thing
beat if hes paranoid play into his grievance
let him air it
beat if hes picked you as an adversary and wants to gloat give him what hes after
a little at a time
if its all electronic switching well need a minute for the trace
graham turns to the window
crawford taps a pencil on his desk
they wait crawfords feet are on his desk
graham leans against the other wall
four more rings
into phone special agent crawfords office
beat bill call back on twenty four four
we need to keep this line clear
she hangs up
crawford takes bills call on the other line
the rest exhale tension and go back to waiting
stares at it
he puts his hands under and runs cold water on his upturned wrists
looking through reports
he picks up a pencil and starts to correct a line when ring
where the hells graham
he went to the mens room
for christs sake get him
an assistant runs out
he slips on the polished floor recovers himself he darts through crawfords door
tries to catch his breath as sarah snaps up the phone
special agent crawfords office
she nods its him could you hold on a second ill see if i can find him
sarah punches hold
crawford is counting seconds
he raises his thumb
graham grabs the phone
calm this is will graham
can i help you
i can help you
i dont understand
atlanta and birmingham
scribbles on a piece of paper
do you know something about that
why do you think i called
i get a lot of calls
most of them are from people who say they know things
crawford holds up the piece of paper
it says chicago phone booth
talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they dont have the capacity to even understand whats going on
you tell me what you know about him
ill tell you whether youre right or not
lets get straight who weve talking about
beat are you the man im interested in
i dont think ill tell you
hes right handed
most people are
cut the general crap
graham stares at crawford
crawford makes a circular motion with his hand string him on
hes very strong physically
hes white and six feet tall
you havent told me anything yet
describe exactly what you think he did to mrs
leeds and ill tell you if youre right or not
i dont want to do that goodbye
graham and us hear a telephone booth door slam open
we hear a receiver fall with a clang
he hear faint voices
the receiver bangs as its swung on the cord
everyone in the outer office hears it on the speaker phone
they also hear freeze
dont even twitch
now lock your fingers behind your head and back our of the booth slowly
graham drops the phone
tension floods out of him
in the outer office people are cheering his eyes almost start to tear in relief as he turns his back and looks out the window
who am i speaking to
graham grabs the phone
will graham fbi
this is sergeant stanley riddle chicago police department
will you tell me what the hells goin on you tell me
you have a man in custody
beat freddie lounds
zoom in on grahams face
it locks in rage
can you hear me
beat are you preferring charges against him or you want him to just run along
im preferring charges
obstruction of justice
you lock that asshole up
you hold him for the u
grabs for the phone
there is a knock on his door
when we were cleaning out dr
lectors cell he heard us coming and hid something in a book
we got him out of there and dug around
fast do you have it
its right here
guard pulls three sheers of toiler paper with writing on them out of his pocket
we hold on it
is already dialling a number
put it down on my desk blotter and dont touch it again
has anyone else handled it except you
sarah answers the phone
special agent crawfords office
in the b
all hell is breaking loose
crawford and graham are both hollering into the phone at freddie lounds
speak up please
i can hardly hear you
shouting i said i need to speak to special agent crawford or mr
holding one ear closed im sorry
special agent crawford and graham are tied up tight now
can i get them to call you back
going nuts this is dr
at the chesapeake hospital
will you please call them this is very very urgent
beat ill hold on
sarah puts chilton on hold
track her into the room
she starts to say something
crawford holds up a hand
hollering howd you know broken mirrors
bribe a cop
beat tell it to the u
seeing sarah what is it
its a dr
he says its urgent
graham punches the phone and takes the call
crawfords yelling at lounds
its will graham
well its about goddamn time
i have a note here or two pieces of a note that appears to be from the man who killed those people in atlanta and
where did you get it
graham waves crawford to the other phone
from hannibal lecktors cell
it was hidden in a book
to lounds run along to the police station freddie
well talk to you when we get around to it
crawford punches into dr
can you read it to me
its written on toilet tissue
reads my dear dr
lecktor i wanted to tell you im delighted that youve taken an interest in me
i know that you alone can understand what im becoming
reads i know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the
radiance of what i am becoming
just as the source of light is burning
graham theres a hole torn and punched our then it says
reads i have a complete collection of your press notices
f think of them as unfair
as unfair as mine
the tooth fairy
what could be more inappropriate
investigator graham interests me
very purposeful locking
i hope we can correspond
beat theres another piece missing here
ill read the bottom part
reads after i hear back from you i might send you something wet
signed avid fan
to graham it has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom
punches the other line
sarah order a chopper
i want the next thing smoking and i dont care whose
or the marines
then call documents
tell them to scramble a team
i want everybody moving in five minutes
punches into dr
chiltons line dr
chilton please do not handle the note
i have a documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up
after weve worked the note we want to replace it in lecktors cell
i dont want him to know we found it
beat wheres lector now
in a holding cell
how long can you keep lecktor out without him getting suspicious
three four hours
have your building superintendent shut off the water and most of the lighting in lecktors hall
have him walk through carrying tools and being pissed off or something yes
we can manage all that
hits another line brian
we have a note coming in on the fly
possibly from the tooth fairy
number one priority
it has to go to hair and fiber latent prints and documents
graham and i will be walking it through
is bent over a microscope
shes under it
behind her a male assistant brushes a childs bib overalls with a metal spatula
he is collecting whatever debris comes off the clothing onto a white paper sheet
beverly katz lifts something with tweezers
she leans away from the micro scope
one hair graham
maybe a thirty second of an inch
a couple of blue grains
ill work it up
what else have you got
hair from lecktors comb
whiskers from an electric razor they let him use
this is hair from the cleaning man
winces at the sight of the paper
he slips it under the helium cadmium laser
bombards the toilet paper with light
growing smudges appear on the paper
perspiration stains nothing else
beat how many guys handled this without gloves
the cleanup man and lecktor
the cleanup man scrubbing sinks probably had the oil washed off his fingers
but the others
beat i could fume it will but couldnt guarantee the iodine stains would fade our in the time youve got to get it back
boosted with heat
we couldnt wash it after
i cant get a print off this will
there isnt one
is underlit by his translucent light box
the note is on it
without looking up how long do i have
twenty minutes max
the main thing is how was lecktor to reply
thats probably in the part lecktor tore out
beat at the top it says i hope we can correspond
and then the hole begins
beat it looks like lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away
he doesnt have anything to cut with
moves under a rostrum camera setup
there are lights mounted on a degree rim even with the base of the rostrum bowman hits a switch
the top lights go out
the side lights are very oblique
under the oblique light the tooth impressions stand out
we hear a shutter click as they are photographed
now we can mash it a little
a pane of glass descends on the note and flattens the jagged edges of the hole
are tattered and smeared with vermillion ink
bowmans fingers hit it
the room is darkened except for a dull glow from the infrared source
chants under his breath youre so sly but so am i
bowman switches to a closed circuit tv camera
the image focuses as bowman focuses the lens
then the ink smear is gone
fragments of writing appear
aniline dyes in the inks in felt tip pens which is what lecktor has are transparent to infrared
the tooth fairys ballpoint isnt
that could be the tip of a t
here and here
at the end is the tail of what could be an r
at the monitor lit by the infrared glow
we know the tooth fairy reads the tattler
the stuff about me and lector
i dont know any other paper that carried it
theres three ts and an r in tattler
as they run out of the room everyone weve seen is assembled graham crawford beverly katz jimmie price and bowman
the chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the tattler right now
when do they go to press
in thirty five minutes
after we find lecktors response we substitute our own
somewhere tomorrow night the tooth fairy will actually buy tattler looking for lecktors message
heres what hell find bill
reads dear avid fan inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements
mementoes for you at baltimore central
its a secret service letter drop and stakeout
he shows we take him
beat anything from chicago
lets get to the physical
there was no print
im here for kicks
scale counts and core size match hannibal lecktors
so does color
the colors different than the tooth fairys taken in birmingham and atlanta
three blue grains and some dark flecks went to brians end
the grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine
must be from the cleaning man
there are several particles of dried blood
not enough to type
its snow white toilet paper
bowman sets up his photographs on an easel
beat if theres any doubt we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the smithsonian teeth
this is your boy
beat he folded the bottom part including what lecktor tore out
in this enlargement of the back side oblique light revealed impressions
we can make out six six six
beat i didnt spot it until i had this high contrast print
i advised chicago as soon as i saw it
issue the toilet paper tear as a
the phone rings
graham punches the speaker
this is chester here
who am i talking to
will graham jack crawford
we got an ad order in tonights tattler with six six six in it
its being telexed to you right now
reads dear pilgrim you honor me
lecktor called him a pilgrim when he was talking to me
youre very beautiful
i offer one hundred prayers for your safety
find help in john luke l galatians
acts revelations i jonah
beat its signed bless you bowman is already running through the onion skinned pages of a bible he took from a shelf
nobody talks to him
checks watch twenty eight minutes
low to sarah cryptography at langley
they got shot a telex
theyre on if now
everybody exhibits disciplined surface calm
the tension is screaming underneath
furiously looking through pages of the bible suddenly stops
to graham no
beat the numbers arent right for a jailhouse alphabet code
its a book code
beat and your message has to go out in it or hell know its not lecktor talking to him
one hundred prayers could be the page number
the paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter
but what book
not the bible
galatians has only six chapters
the same with jonah jonah has four chapters
lecktor wasnt using a bible
then the tooth fairy named the book in the part lecktor tore out
beat what about sweating lecktor
they tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a princeton student
beat he gave them a recipe for potato chip dip
it has to be a book the tooth fairy would know lecktor has in his cell
hed know it from articles hes read about lecktor
willingham when he tossed his cell took polaroids so they could get everything back in place
have him meet me with pictures of lecktors books
library of congress
bowmans our the door
twenty five minutes
we wont make it in time
looks at watch we let lecktors message run as is and decode it after
or we pull it work our the code and put ours in next week
can we still get lecktors message out of the paper
and im leery of running lecktors message without knowing what it says
and if we pull it we lose a week
we only have two to the next full moon
its your call will
what do we do
graham has to decide
then he looks up run it
what if it encourages the tooth fairy to do something besides write
we will feel sick for a very long time
the floor is in focus
in the b
are busy out of focus images newspapers magazines people passing
we dont know why we are holding on the empty floor
then a stack of tattlers hits the floor
the headlines include head transplant and astronomers glimpse god
asleep in bed
sheets are twisted between his legs
his arms are widespread
the phone rings
will graham doesnt hear it
it keeps ringing
move in on graham
finally he stirs then fights his way up out of sleep
his hand snakes out and grabs the phone to make it stop ringing
who is it
will bowman just broke the code
it was a james beard cook book
you need to know what it says right now
whatd it say
ill tell you in a second
now listen to me everything is okay im taking care of it so stay on the phone when i tell you
tell me now
it says graham home desoto highway marathon florida
kill them all
beat its your home address will
the bastard gave him your home address
get me a plane
get me a plane
ill pick you up in
i wont be here
on the move
kevin looks over her shoulder out the window as if hes scared of something
what time is it
mom someones outside
starts and sits up
dark shadows play against darkened walls
we hear crashing wave
moonlight makes trees whipped in the wind throw dappled shadows across the corridor
molly enters the frame in close shot
we track with her in a three quarter rear shot behind the back of her head
she feels vulnerable
the dappled leaves whip across her face in a sudden gust
mollys head snaps around
with the tree moving in the wind
beyond is the ocean with moonlight on the surf
moves into the kitchen
a streetlight hits part of the kitchen with a dim phosphorescent green
whispers go into your room and lock the door
he catches mollys eye a silhouette shape moves past the window
the angle of the streetlight plays its shadow on the wall against molly
she hears the outer screen door being opened
the shape is at the door
molly takes a couple of steps and cant go any further
breathless opens the door
reveals florida state trooper
are you all right maam
fast breathing yes
beat whats going on as molly comes out of the house we pull back and crane up into a very high angle wide shot revealing four state trooper cars parked
on grahams property
on the road are two roadblocks yards apart on either side of grahams house
all their flashers are going
molly looks around in confusion
we see her turn to the sea a coast guard launch pulls to yards off the beach
its searchlight plays on the waters edge then across the property
molly look at all the policemen
advances on us its engine screaming
its front wheel brakes to a stop right before camera
running down the stairs and across the tarmac is will graham in shirtsleeves with a car assault rifle with collapsible stock
his eyes scan the perimeter
moving fast follow graham
their eyes sweep the terminal area
one carries an uzi submachine gun the other two handguns
hussle molly and kevin between them from their cars towards graham
two carry suitcases
inside the protective barrier of men
graham moves molly and kevin up into the gulf stream
fbi men follow
the troopers back off
the flashers on their cars are still turning
pan right with the gulf stream as it taxis to the head of the runway
it pauses a moment then blasts down the runway and up into the morning sun
then it opens
molly and kevin followed by graham
unmarked fbi cars are parked on the front lawn
molly enters the foyer looks around and stops
holiday inn decor
who decorated this place richard nixon
molly takes a deep breath
then lets it out
graham takes her hand
im sorry this happened to you
you didnt do it to me will its happened to us
touches his face and if i survive the wallpaper well be okay
graham has to smile hes after you now isnt he
she didnt check to see that kevin is our of earshot
its a precaution
to kevin why dont you run down to the bay
they got a swimming float
ill hang around in here
ill just be in the kitchen mom
to molly what is he
afraid to leave you alone with me now
beat he read the tattler piece didnt he
he didnt know you had been in a mental institution
be asked me if i knew
i said yes
i wanted to talk to him
he said he wanted to bring it up to you
face to face
good for him
beat thanks a lot freddie
to kevin kevin
were going grocery shopping
push a basket collecting stuff from the shelves
other families are shopping the place is medium crowded
mind dulling muzak comes from the ceiling
is there anything i need to know to see about mom
youre very well protected
no one can find our where you are
barrys mom had this newspaper
it said you killed the guy in minnesota and were in a mental hospital
is it true
i figured id ask you
i was in the psychiatric wing
it bothers you finding out i was in there
i told my dad before he died id take care of mom
and ill do it
beat this guy wants to kill you
we dont know that
are you gonna kill him
its just my job to find him
beat i was in the hospital after garrett jacob hobbs
how did it happen
hobbs was insane
he was attacking college girls and he killed them
with a knife
beat i found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls
the kind of shred a pipe threader makes
i was taking a look at steam fitters plumbers
it took a long time
in one place there was a resignation letter from a man named hobbs
i saw it and it was
beat i was going up these stairs to hobbs apartment
i was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me
she was dying
beat i sent the officer with me to call a swat team
but i could hear kids in there and screaming
i couldnt wait
you went in the apartment
hobbs had one of his daughters from behind
he was cutting her
i shot him
we get the feeling graham is leaving out lots of pieces and gives kevin only the bare bones of what he needs to know
i kept thinking there must be some way i could have handled it better
it kept replaying in my mind
later i got depressed
a doctor friend of mine dr
bloom asked me to go into a hospital
after a while i got some distance on it and was okay
did the girl die
she got all right
after a while
and hobbs died
kevin pauses then asks with year old innocence killing somebody feels that bad
turns and stares at kevin kevin its the ugliest thing in the world
kevin thinks about this for a long time
he feels he understands graham and is closer to him for it what kind of coffee do you like
you like that colombian stuff dont you
kevin reaches for the coffee and puts it in the basket
mom likes that too
walk down the aisle
graham puts his hand over kevins shoulder
they look like father and son
as they disappear around a corner
beyond is chesapeake bay and the nightlights of baltimore reflecting across it
the swimming float bobs in the distance
one yellow light is on it
the grass looks cold in the moonlight
holly wears a heavy cardigan
behind them with yellow lights the house looks like a motel
its hard to have anything isnt it
rare to get it hard to keep it
this is a damn slippery planet
when she said this she was staring out to sea
now she turns to look at graham and puts a hand on his arm
he still stares out to sea slick as hell
then graham looks at her and covers her hand with his own
you remember when we first met
and were together alone in that room
and the exhilaration was too much to hold on to
and then something flickered across your face like a shadow and i asked you what was wrong
do you remember what you said
i said this is too good to live
molly stares into his eyes
time is luck will
heat i know the value of our days
they stare into each other
theres a pause
she puts her arm around grahams waist
they start towards the house
lets go to bed
ill rub your back
i need to talk to you about will graham
what about him
i need to ask you questions of a psychological nature
remember when you asked for a study on him i refused
same goes for now
that was peterson upstairs
it was you who did the asking
he doesnt think you run mind games on him
i wouldnt presume to try
youre never alone in a room with graham are you
youre smooth about it but youre never one on one with him
do you think hes psychic
hes an eideteker
he has almost total recall
but i dont think hes psychic
what he has it empathy and projection he can assume your point of view and mine
and some other points of view that scare and sicken him
why arent you ever alone with him
because im professionally concerned about him
and hed pick up on that
he hates being prodded and poked
beat so do i
beat what do you want
his nervous breakdown followed hobbs
could he kill again if he had to save his life
or would he hesitate
ill tell you the events
the psychologys none of your business
hobbs was trying to cut his eleven year old daughters throat
graham shot him with his
hobbs still didnt go down
he had to wade in
thats when it happened
it happened when graham went to see hobbs daughter four months later in the hospital
she saved her carotid artery
but lost three fingers and her larynx
she was connected up to a voice box
when graham went to see her she asked him through the speaker why did you have to kill my daddy
beat thats when graham had his nervous breakdown
whats the bottom line
if he pushes too deep into our boys mind set he may destroy himself
beat what are you planning jack
could he handle a direct contact
i dont recommend it
you dont recommend what sidney
crawford is surprised at grahams entry
crawford has a proposition
i dont think its a good idea
if the tooth fairy listens to lecktor hell come for me
so were going to set me up as bait to draw him out
give him a clean shot
beat thats what you were thinking isnt it
bloom said graham was fast
ill use lounds
now blooms surprised
sidney he doesnt read the sunday times literary supplement
he reads lounds in the tattler
beat and i want this over with
graham leans against a table his back to a window
i believe hes socially maladjusted
laughed at by his contemporaries
how does he rate compared to dr hannibal lecktor
hes not as intelligent
pull back to reveal bloom crawford a photographer and assistant
graham motions for lounds to turn off his tape recorder
to bloom what have we missed
he may have an unconscious homosexual conflict
a fear of being gay
he objects to the word fairy
plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on charles leeds after he was dead
i believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in mr leeds
graham motions lounds to turn the tape recorder on again
the killer has sexually molested all his male victims
he is a homosexual and impotent with persons of the opposite sex
beat our forensic psychologists have projected he may have been the product of an incestuous home life
added afterthought and probably had sexual relations with his mother
crawford stifles a laugh
how long will you stay in washington
until weve taken out the tooth fairy
graham gestures for lounds to turn off the tape recorder
lets shoot the pictures
to crawford i want shots with me and graham together
cmon cmon cmon
you want this to look real dont you
lounds lays grahams arm over his own shoulder and mugs or the camera
behind him is the flood lit capitol dome and the sign of a motel across the street
keep the motel sign across the street just slightly out of focus
he has to be able to read it but it cant look too obvious
lounds barks orders to the still photographer and splits
the photographer starts breaking down his gear
crawford takes graham aside
low asian studies at langley said the mark you found on the tree is a chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling
the character also appears on a mah jongg piece
beat it means red dragon
beat that mean anything to you
spurgen chief swat instructor from quantico examines the parking lot
weve cut in mid dialogue
if hes smart hell approach from the front pass and take you from the back
how well do you hear

itll be invisible in this light but youll stand out like a zebra for us
beat they told me you checked out a
charter arms bulldog

spurgen hands graham a glycine envelope containing rounds of
instead of a lead bullet theres a matte black blunt nosed cylinder
glaser safety slugs
nods commercially prohibited

on impact it all opens up in the target
expect the recoil
theyre hot loads
kevlar second chance
i hope you have a second chance
because hes gone for the head shot seven out of eight times you got it
lets walk the route
as they start across the parking lot weve been here before
the floor is empty
in the wide angle out of focus the newsstand operator is squatted down reading the chicago tribune
in the empty space is dumped a bundle of tattlers a pair of black zippered boots enters and stands behind the man
without looking what is it
youll have to wait until i bust a bundle
one black boot kicks the tattler bundle
hot i said wait til i bust a bundle
a hand and a flash of bright steel rip through the frame
the wire is cut with a pop
a dollar bill is thrown on the floor
the hand whips a tattler out from the center of the bundle
raise up with the outraged newsstand operator
the retreating man turns to face him
it is francis dollarhyde
fuckin told you
interrupting you told me what
he starts coming back
he rakes off his silver sunglasses revealing the white violet eyes
you told me what
you got a quarter comin back
pulls into the prescribed space
he kills the engine and gets out
exiting the car
the image is in green and black
we are behind the balustrade in a prone firing position sighting through a heavy barrelled heckler and koch model with a startron scope
also in green and black
reveal we are with the same rifle sweeping the parking lot
he reacts to something to his left
walking along the determined line fifty yards from the apartment building
hears something through the delicate patter of the rain
a distant plop plop plop of running feet
then entering around the corner is a running man
hes heavy and wears a running suit with the hood up
his face is lost in its shadow
is gloved and slips into the pocket of his jacket grasping something
splash through shallow puddles
the foot beats are getting louder
like taut wire about to snap
on the left
the runner enters on the right
in slow motion as they cross graham slams him sideways
is knocked off balance and slams face forward into the side of a car
he comes off the car violently to turn to fight
pressure on the trigger
turns into camera
he is a black man with a moustache and scared eyes staring into the
his hands shoot into the air yo boss
plastic and cash in the right pocket
re the mistake god dammit
walking away graham rips off his jacket and the kevlar vest
coming off the expectation of contact graham is explosive
the runner looks at graham as if hes crazy spurgen and two d
cops are running in
arrest dat sucker
crawford catches up to graham you okay
graham shoulders past crawford he throws the kevlar vest across the parking lot
he almost killed the man
meanwhile spurgen is with the runner
it was a mistake
sorry yo mama
runner pissed off starts towards graham
spurgen stops him
we thought you were someone were trying to catch
backs up hold onto this
grabs his groin i get dat cannon stuck up mah face
car dirt splattered up and down mah calvin kleins
you couldnt catch yo ass with yo right hand
you lucky you muther fuckers catch a cold
who the hell goin pay my cleanin bill
huge laughter which is coming from
lounds and two secretaries are cracking up
he apparently told them the funniest joke they ever heard
see you freddie
pleased with himself walks to his car
enters frame unlocking his car door
a hand falls on lounds shoulder and turns him into camera lounds self satisfied smile still beams
a chloroformed rag jams into his face
a massive hand holds his head and neck steady and is nor bothered by his struggles
a hand puts ammonia under his nose
lounds regains consciousness
he tries to move
there are sanitary napkins covering lounds eyes and mouth
the one on his mouth is removed
we will see only lounds
are you cold
would you like a blanket
was i in an accident
youll be just fine
my back hurts my skin
did i get burned
i hope to god im not burned
you just rest there
ill be right back
let me lie down
listen i want to call my office
my god im in a stryker frame
my backs broken
tell me the truth
footsteps are going away
what am i doing here
do you know who i am mr
i dont want to know
according to you im a sexual failure
an animal you said
beat you know now dont you
do you feel privileged
im very scared
do you pray to god mr
do you believe god is in attendance here mr
i dont know
in a little while ill help you understand
a kettle whistles
ill be right back
as if he had any choice
lounds face moves he strains
his arms are glued to the chair
dollarhydes hand comes back with a cup of tea and a straw
id do a big story
anything you want to say
describe you any way you want or no description
the hand rips off the sanitary napkins covering lounds eyes
lounds jams his eyes shut
the lights brighten
a single finger taps the top of his head
open your eyes mr
i dont want to see you
lounds youre a reporter
youre here to titillate your readers
if you dont open your eyes ill staple your eyelids to your forehead
a finger taps lounds on his chest
a touch on his eyelids
lounds slowly opens his eyes
his face goes white
singsong well here
dollarhyde opens and drops the black silk kimono
his muscular frame bears the full body tattoo of william blakes red dragon the head on dollarhydes chest the tail snaking down and wrapping around one of dollarhydes legs
his back is to us in a weight lifters pose
a rolled up stocking covers dollarhydes head to just below his nose
dollarhydes teeth are jagged and brown stained
and he smiles at lounds in front of the white screen
oh my dear god jesus
the shape of dollarhyde passes behind his head
the kimono is on again
a slide appears
it is blakes painting
look at the screen
that is william blakes the great red dragon and the woman clothed with the sun
do you see
next picture mrs
jacobi eyes wide
do you see
leeds alive locked into a silent scream in her bedroom
do you see
staring in horror
we will not see the rest of the slider
leeds harlequined with blood her husband beside her
do you see
jacobi after her changing
as lounds nods the dragon rampant
do you see
do you see
do you see
are you a man
do you imply that im a queer
are you queer mr
beyond him is the screen and the image of freddie lounds with grahams arm over his shoulder
before me you are a slug in the sun
you are privy to a great becoming and you recognize nothing
you are an ant in the afterbirth
beat it is your nature to do only one thing correctly tremble
bur fear is not what you owe me
lounds you and the others you owe me awe
long pause we have one more piece of work to do
lounds closes his eyes
to himself didnt take off the mask
please god let him not take off the mask
if he comes back with it off im dead
carries a tape recorder
we pan it across the room to lounds face
open your eyes mr
the stocking mask and teeth stained and jagged are in place
now you will read this into the tape recorder
i have had a great privilege
i have seen with wonder the strength of the red dragon
all i wrote about him before was lies from will graham
he made me write them
now i understand
beat will graham you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread
because i was forced to lie he will be more merciful to me than to you
beat i will be a testament to the truth now
about his work
about his becoming
turns off the tape recorder
you did very well
i apologize for the crude images
next time ill have film stock that doesnt need lights
youll let me go now
you will tell the truth
beat well seal your promise with
with the stocking rolled down over his nose smiles his dentured smile
and with his kimono open revealing the face of the dragon emblazoned in crimson on his muscular torso he leans into camera
with a kiss
the figures seen from the back
we dont know what dollar hyde leaning over lounds is doing but lounds screams
dollarhydes van is on the left against the wall
the alley is empty
then we see shapes between the van and the wall
we do not see his face
we see his shoulder and his lap
from an unseen facial wound blood drips onto his pants leg
dollarhyde starts spilling liquid on lounds
lounds starts to moan and rouse from unconsciousness
his head starts to turn
he knows hes going to die
and he has some courage
go head and kill ee you astard
you rot in ell
rot in ell
he pencils some selections
start tracking left across the back of his neck
midway we hear the squeak of a wheel chair
the parking attendant hears it too
as the track continues over his left shoulder he puts down the racing form and looks
then he goes back to the racing form
now the wheels squeak and echo louder
his head raises again
he turns into camera
theres a loud woosh
his eyes go wide
he explodes out of his chair screaming
lounds is a fireball racing towards us
just before the fireball would smash into camera
graham and molly are sitting at the kitchen table over cups of coffee
graham is looking down into the formica
he and molly say nothing for a long time
then can i have one of your cigarettes
surprised you havent smoked in two years
id like one of your cigarettes please
graham gives her one
molly lights up
she picks a piece or tobacco from her lips
shes trying to control fear
have you ever omitted telling me
i wanted it over fast
beat it felt dirty to not tell you
can you quit
where are things
where were at is nowhere
we have nothing
were running out of time
there is a long pause
molly suspects what will you do
i have to go back to birmingham
is crawford going with you
i have to be
maybe theres something for me if i know how he feels and thinks
william you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed
graham says nothing
kevin and i have lived through
with kevins father
and we cant
she cant finish
theres a pause
then she looks at him
you should go to montana
stay with kevins grandparents
they havent seen him for a while
beat ill come and get you afterwards
he shakes his head and locks away from her wondering about himself molly
pause i love you
and im not really going to be fit to be with for awhile
they are both frozen in the same room but very separate
mollys eyes are moist
she gets up and leaves
graham sits at the kitchen table by himself both hands around his mug of coffee
slowly deliberately he picks up the mug to take a sip
then he sits alone in the kitchen
on a pay phone to dr
sidney i dont understand him
we know he re arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience
to witness the act
we know he thinks the act is making him into something different
his becoming but i dont know what it is he thinks hes becoming
beat the answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors
thats whats missing for me
why the mirrors
the usual motivation doesnt apply to him nor the way he uses them
i dont have an answer for you
beat listen to me my friend leave this
and do what
read about the next family in the morning paper
in my monkey ward safehouse cause i cant take my family home
beat this ends when i make it over
how are molly and the boy
kevin and molly are on their way to montana
beat who the hell is he to do this to my family sidney
answer me that
sidney bloom has no answer
outside is gray
rain stripes the glass
sheets of rain whip across the silver planes and yellow utility vehicles
grahams hand enters and flattens against his half reflection on the cool glass
he hears ansaphone recording hello
this is valerie leeds
im sorry i cant come to the phone right now
im sorry too
the waitress looks at him strangely
he stares at his handprint and says
its just you and me now sport
and id better hurry up and find you
beat because im losing all this
it is almost totally dark
in the green dullness we make our the forms of a woman and dollarhyde
mcclain im francis dollarhyde
i came about the low light level infrared film stock
put your back against the doer
come forward three steps until you feel the tile an your feet and there will be a stool just to your left
we see dollarhydes form follow instructions and sit
can you give me an idea of the conditions
shooting at maybe eight feet
i cant use any lights
whats being photographed
the activities of nocturnal animals
when do you need it
in eight days
let me stick this in the black hole
we see some movements
then the light comes on
hand is curled under his nose hiding his z plast scars
then he reacts to something
his face lights up in an uncharacteristically open smile
he brazenly looks the woman up and down
we dont understand why he can do this
reba mcclain is blind
her white cane is propped in the corner
shes thirty with a handsome prairie face
the c infrared sensitive film must be handled in total darkness
i keep the samples straight by touch code
beat its still easier to handle than a series
think itll do
itll do fine
young manager of the department enters checks watch
reba dear ive got to fly
dollarhyde if it wouldnt be too much trouble could you help her home
i can help myself home ralph
dollarhyde stares after him
he doesnt like him
then ill take you
standing close no thanks
i manage very well
beat ill order you twelve hundred feet of c tomorrow
reba walks our of the dark room
we pass reba on the sidewalk
she is walking briskly with her cane and tapping in front of her
shes very confident
ride with me
thanks but ill take the bus
i do it all the time
dandridge is a condescending prick
ride with me
it would be because i want you to
she likes dollarhydes directness
he gets our and comes around to help her in
he starts to take her arm
its better if i rake your arm
we hear footsteps come up
rebas key is in the lock
as the door is starting to open come on in
beat how about a gin and tonic
tonic will be fine
in the kitchen
she momentarily forgets retraces her steps and turns on the light
she opens the refrigerator
during the next pieces of dialogue we will see reba being ex tremely competent making the drinks
how did you come to gateway
they had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract
reba takes a l inch chefs knife and deftly cuts the lime guiding it with her thumb
you worked out well
you know you speak very well although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech
at the riker institute for the blind
i trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children
reacts to speech therapy
characteristically his attention goes to in rebas hand
its extremely sharp cutting edge glints in the light
another slice of lime falls
ill probably go back to it someday
reba hands him his drink
if you dont want to talk
bur i hope you will
because i like what you say
dollarhyde is stunned at both her perception and frankness
may i touch your face
as dollarhyde reacts i want to know if youre smiling or frowning
i want to know if i should just shut up or not
theres a smile on her face
now her hand moves up towards dollarhydes mouth with the z plast scars where his harelip and cleft palate were fixed
dollarhydes fist grabs it
turns her hand in the light
take my word for it that im
there is no smile on dollarhydes face
if ive offended you i didnt mean to
he still has her hand in his grasp
i have to go now
he lets go of her hand
sits among piles of leeds family possessions
he opens a childs toy
its large pink plastic and heart shaped
its a mexican fantasy house with puffy white plastic clouds strange handles and doors with eyes in them half and half out of a shaft of yellow light that radiates
motes of dust in the air
graham merely sits and stares into all of the debris of this dead family
pull back to see the vast expanse of the room which is a total disarray of all the furniture all the possessions and papers all the bits and pieces of
matter that are accumulated in a life by two adults and three children
everything from washing machines to tricycles to sleds
they litter the vast floor space
while we widen we hear whats he doin
been in there all day
just sits and stares at the stuff
the camera now includes two uniformed security guards at the door
they watch graham as we widen and pull back they fall into rear shot
her cane taps the white tile floor
its antiseptic and sinister
we worry about where hes taking her
ready to tell me what kind of outing this is
its a surprise
her head arcs back as she senses francis
were at the zoo
in two days were going to cap his tooth
can you smell him
are you apprehensive
your protective and muscular gentleman over there is watching us like a cat
i want to
dollarhyde reacts with a light smile at the compliment
all right put your left hand on the edge of the table and you can explore with your right
ill be right here beside you
we see reba start to reach out
then we see what she is about to touch
rebas hand feels the fur slide across her palm
the fur springs between her fingers
rebas hand enters down its foreleg
warfield with two hands lifts the great paw and puts it in her hand
rebas hand feels the roughness of the pads
she presses and the claw slides cut
both her hands go up his leg to the heavy supple muscles of his shoulder
rebas hand gently touches the tigers ears and both hands feel the width of his head
the hot breath coming across its rough tongue stirs the hairs on her forearms
rebas arms wrap around the huge chest
slowly her face lowers and she puts her ear next to the tigers ribs
we hear what she hears the heartbeat
it fills us and reba with its bright thunder
its a large reproduction
its a pre psychological evocation of violent sexual impulses
it has come right after the image of reba and the tiger
we hear water running
hands are rebas
we follow them up to the wall as they search for and find a towel
we hear the hum of a film projector starring
we see the sightless reba reflected in the mirror
feeling her way she starts out
its dark brown with wing armed s futuristic furniture
a sryrosphere casts scars and constellations throughout the room
a full sized mural from jpl of the mars surface is on one wall
we move past objects a recliner lounger two film projectors a black and white fifties clock with golf bails in the arrow arms a magnavox console tv set and a
sofa with dollarhyde and reba on it
theyre watching a movie
the film projector hums
we dont see what movie dollarhyde is watching
beat that was nice of you to think of that
i made you a gin and tonic
its by the side of the sofa
dollarhyde looks at reba
then he looks at the film
the two of them are like a tableau of suburban tv watching
theyre like a married couple sitting on the sofa
except the movie is mrs
jacobi looking up and mrs
leeds looking up
shermans legs scissoring in the water
then her breasts swelling and shining above her suit as she pushes herself our of the pool
dollarhydes blase watching his horror show
he looks at reba
unknowing is suffused with a calm equanimity
her breasts rise and fall with her breathing
the flickering light from the screen intermittently illuminates and darkens the planes of her face
the smooth skin and down like hairs undulate from the bearing of her living heart
is watching her pulse rise and fall under the soft skin and doesnt see
moves along the back of the sofa to dollarhyde
moves towards dollarhydes face
enters the frame and kisses dollarhyde on the mouth
dollarhydes eyes freeze open
he is stunned
rebas left hand opens dollarhydes shirt and slides down his chest towards his pants
soft whisper take me upstairs
dollarhydes bedroom dolil hwdes night head on the satin comforter
his eyes are wide open
his reaction to this event is immobility and shock
let me get them off
i dont care
my god man
rebas hand with her long gentle fingers enters the frame caressing the side of dollarhydes face
we will hear rebas voice and see little of her
we will see dollarhydes face and the expressions on it wonder and amazement
youre so sweet d
heat let me come up to you and take it
her hand moves down from his face down his neck and rests on his chest
it rests on the face of what is tattooed there the great red dragon
soft your heart is loud
beat feel all of me
dollarhyde knows what he feels he is pole axed
he doesnt know what he thinks
she holds dollarhyde in the near dark
his hand caresses her forehead and brushes light brown hair from her face
wide awake eases her away
then he puts his ear to her breast and listens to her heart beating
dollarhyde is re lieved
then dollarhyde touches her gently softly in wonder and amazement
then dollarhyde leaves
dollarhyde re enters frame and puts a glass of water next to her
he covers her
he lays down again next to her
reba stirs half awake murmurs dreamily
dollarhyde supports the back of her head and offers her some water
dollarhydes arm moves under her pillow
she snuggles closer to him
dollarhydes eyes are moist
rebas hand moves up his stomach and rests on his chest
it rests above his heart
it rests on the face of the crimson dragon
when she is asleep again dollarhyde takes her hand off the great tattoo and puts it on his face
dollarhyde cloven in two accepted by a living reba will not sleep for a very long time
it is morning
he snaps awake
he is horror struck rebas pillow is empty
shes nor there
dollarhyde races our of the room
dollarhyde stops in the door frame
is that you
yes are you okay
in her cotton dress
the prairie wind blows her hair and presses the thin cotton against her body in the overgrown weeds and wildflowers of dollarhydes backyard
nears her towers above her
he touches her face
reba folds into his arms and lays her head on his hard chest
his heart is going fast
he doesnt believe this fine thing is happen ing to him and that shes okay
kisses his cheek if you show me where things are ill make us some coffee
dont go back into the house
to rebas quizzical reaction its too nice outside
my sisters coming by to pick me up for brunch
why dont you come too
i have work to do at the plant
ill get my purse
ill get it
leaving stay right here
you lock very good in the sun
hes heavy set and sullen
dollarhydes van with reba pulls in
do you want a coke or something reba
im fine francis
dollarhyde gets out
fill it up and check the oil please
dollarhyde crosses to the mens room
after placing the nozzle in the gas tank the attendant bangs open the hood draws the dipstick grabs a can of jams the oil spout into the can and sticks
the spout into the engine
as he starts to move around the van he sees something in the interior and stops
a smile dawns on his face
we dont know what he sees
he starts wiping the windshield
he wipes and wipes the same spot
dress is just above her knees
she sits on the high seat
her legs are crossed
her white cane lays between the seats
from his lower angle at the van window the attendant can look up her dress
he bends down a little to see better
then dollarhyde enters
he crumples a paper rowel and throws it in the basket
dollarhyde crosses around the backside of the van
as he starts to reach for his wallet on the dash he sees what the attendants doing
unaware of dollarhyde is grinning and still wiping the same spot in front of reba
is coming around the van
cocky you dont like it
you know what you can do about it
attendant starts away
dollarhyde catches him and shoves him into and through a display of stp
the attendant bounces once and slams into the station wall
cans crash and roll away
dollarhyde does know what he can do about it
through the windshield
shes trying to find the handle to roll down the window
there is something in dollarhydes face that he has never seen before anywhere
pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine
he advances on the frozen attendant
he looks at the sharp end of the spout
is wide eyed
dollarhydes big hand enters and flattens the man into the wall compressing his thorax
i ought to jam this in your chest and drain your heart
the attendant tries to say hes sorry but he cant talk
dollarhydes hand has grabbed his face
then he throws money at the attendant and leaves
with crawford on the phone
you got the message lecktor called
i arranged for him to have a phone
i have to call him in a few minutes
from the lip wound which happened seven hours before he got burned weve narrowed it down to those cities within the seven hour driving radius that also wouldve caught the

graham hangs up the phone
he looks out the window at the rain
he dials again

garrett jacob hobbs to death it wasnt the act that got you down
didnt you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good
ironic and why shouldnt it feel good
it must feel good to god
god does it all the time
then he starts to listen closely
there is something here for him i dont believe in god
you should will
beat he dropped a church roof on thirty four of his worshippers in texas last wednesday night
just as they were grovelling to him and singing a hymn
dont you think that felt good
beat he wouldnt begrudge you two measly murders
why does it feel good
it feels good because if you do as god does enough times you become as god is powerful
will graham thinks about this
fading gods a champ
he got a hundred and sixty philippines in one plane crash two months ago
remember the big earthquake in italy last spring
lecktors voice fades as will graham hangs us on him
graham sits on the crumpled bed and stares out the window at the rain
stands in the kitchen
his raincoat and rainhat drip water onto the floor
the house no longer is a crime scene
its been cleaned up
it is absolutely naked
shades are drawn
slashes of light hit the floor
graham stands there
then he walks forward
the glass cutter
i lick the suction cup
the piece of glass i take out is mine
house is mine
beat i walk up these stairs
i pass childrens toys
the children mean nothing to me
the toys appear on the stairs as grahams feet continue moving up the stairs to the second floor landing
i am soundless
i move to the door
i step into the room
the room is white
we dont see the bed
graham stands there in profile
beyond graham out of focus the wall starts to discolor
pieces of plaster start to fall
the room starts to disintegrate around graham
we will see what graham sees in his mind
i see you there
i breathe in the perfume of this room
i am in the inner sanctum of a life
you will accept me
take me into you
the ceiling and walls decomposing
nothing falls on the bed
charles leeds sleeps with his arm under mrs
leeds is on her side
slowly she starts to rise
she sees the figure in front of her and her mouth opens to scream
a silent shot shoves her back to the headboard
red blood starts to stain her nightgown as she holds the wound
we float closer
in slow motion mr
leeds starts to rise
something massive and silver flashes through the frame
he is gone
leeds was looking at her hand covered with blood
leeds looks up at us
her face turns into a smile
her eyes are silver
a silver light emanates from her mouth
she smiles at us
she wants us
she really wants us
her hand gestures us closer
as we move closer we hear you will be better than anything
anything i have ever known
as i see me in your eyes
as i see me accepted there
reflected there in mirrors
beat and you you are the fuel for my changing
as this event becomes one more step towards what i am becoming that is different than what i have ever been before
beat as i see me accepted by you in the silver mirrors of your eyes
in the silver mirrors of her eyes graham sees reflected there himself
it is empty
the bare floorboards a dynamic perspective of lines go nowhere
grahams scream reverberates in the empty house
it is pitch black
in the green safe light we make our the rollers and pulleys carrying film through the vats of d developer and fixer
it is mechanized
there is no one to maintain it
distantly on the floor in a far corner we perceive the shape of a man and reddish glow
the camera starts moving towards the shape on the floor
as we get closer we realize its dollarhyde
something is wrong with him
by now were close to his body curled up on the floor in the sanctuary of the developing room
the red glow emanates from beneath dollarhydes shirt
i want her
i want her alive
im going to keep her
you hear he starts throwing bottles of chemicals across the room
they form a moire pattern of colors on walls
some splash on him and make his shirt smoke
dollarhydes unsteady hand takes it off the wall
be pours sweat
if the acid that makes his shirt smoke burns him he doesnt acknowledge it
he punches four numbers
where are you
the developing room
beat i need to
i want to see you too francis
should i come over
into phone no
phone filter are you okay
into phone getting control ill see you later
phone filter youll come by
into phone yes
he sits under the tree with the lights out
he is waiting
he looks at his watch
then he hears a car approach and looks up
pulls into rebas drive
he starts to get out
now he stops
exit the oldsmobile
he helps reba out of the car
she makes her own way up the sidewalk to her door
reba opens her door with a key
she turns towards dandridge
theres something on your face
he brushes at a speck of dust on rebas cheek
events are threatening dollarhydes fragile stabil ity
we dont want this to be happening we dont want dandridge to touch her
we see what dollarhyde imagines dandridges fingers caress the soft skin of rebas face
rebas expression and mouth are open and warm to him
her lips part
his finger brushes between her lips
his hand goes to her breast
hand clutches the dash
his fingers pop through the vinyl gouging deep furrows
we hear hyperventilating
there was no there is no seduction
what was it
thanks for the ride
see you tomorrow
reba walks into her apartment
walks back to his car
we are tracking with dandridge walk ing past the hedges
an arm shoots out and turns dandridge
dollarhydes hand clutches the whole of dandridges lower face from underneath his jaw
he starts crushing dandridges face
three soft pops are from dollarhydes nine millimeter
he shot dandridge three times in the heart
moving in the dark
the doorbell rings
she has unbuttoned her blouse
now she goes back to answer the door
who is it
she opens the door and smiles
its not francis
francis is gone
francis is gone forever
as he steps towards her
its full and very large as it dawns over black water that seems to ripple and be drawn to it
pull back to reveal we are next to the window we see the jacobi family in fishing scene on a monitor
they are on a pier into a small lake with poles and bobbers
the kids turn back and wave at us
the scene changes to a birthday party
the jacobis are sitting around a dining table
they are singing
he changes them into beings that accept him
and he needs to see the acceptance in the mirrors
i didnt understand the mirrors before
beat its very important
its a word
beat his delusion is if he sees himself accepted enough times he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time
beat and he would record it somehow
so he can see himself received over and over again
vtr film polaroid stills what
how do i know
graham is intent on the tape
then hes very careful very
designed when he chooses beat if we find out how he finds them then well find him
theres no connection between the families
there has to be
exasperated there is none
weve run it through the computer a dozen times
grahams beyond frustration
suddenly calm hes a very shy boy
something lecktor said
lets admit we struck out this month
the gulf streams standing by
the basic lab stuff is on it
you zeller jimmie price a photographer
anywhere he hits we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes
we get the call we roll
the scenell be very fresh
its not over yet
its a foregone conclusion
for christs sake its eleven pm
the full moon is tonight
graham doesnt answer
hes totally concentrated on the film
donald jacobi big birthday card to the camera
it says happy birthday follow the ribbon
camera follows donald jacobi following the ribbon into the basement and the flood lights reveal a ten speed bicycle
explodes you wanna watch this or what
crawford stares at him
then he works his way through a report with a penlight
we are outside in the rain
donald jacobi brings the bicycle out
the camera pans past the padlock on the basement door
grahams hand flashes into frame and slams on the freeze button
thats why the boltcutter
he used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way
when he was watching from the woods
why didnt he use it to go through the basement door
because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed
you mean jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered
he had to
graham rifles through the files and comes up with the autopsy report on donald jacobi
donald jacobis eleventh birthday party was april fourteenth
sometime between april fourteenth and may third they changed the door
beat but you cant see either familys door from the street
he wouldnt know until he got to the house that the padlock wasnt there anymore
he freezes the jacobi tape and loads and plays the leeds tape intently on the screen from the alley he couldnt have seen the glass in the leeds kitchen door
theres a lattice porch back there but he was ready with his glasscutter
beat so he was either casing far ahead and we didnt check back far enough or
the leeds gray scottie perks up his ears and runs in the glass kitchen door
the camera pans off the dog to valerie leeds coming in the door behind her the door is vulnerable with its big glass pane
her kids follow her through the door
its getting late and
explodes dont talk to me
then he grabs the phone and punches numbers
the jacobi stuff is still in the storeroom
you know what time it is
have one of the guards down there call me
if the guys not asleep
he hangs up on metcalfe
grahams hand freezes the leeds rape and plays the jacobi tape
the jacobis cat moves jumps on the table
to himself you knew that was the jacobis cat
the jacobi boy pushes the bicycle out of the basement door with the padlock
to himself you brought a boltcutter
cause you thought there was a padlock
acobi warm smiling watches donald ride the bike
now graham plays the leeds tape too
the dog runs to camera
to himself and the leeds dog doesnt have a collar
but you know its the leeds dog dont you my man
his tail wagging his tongue out hes a friendly dog
leeds enters and pets him
to himself see the woman
crawford is staring at graham strangely
this is why crawford drafted him
but crawford doesnt look like he wants to be alone in the same room with graham anymore
the bloom on the woman
you can almost feel her
you can see her again and again
anytime you want
beat the doggy doesnt have a collar
but you know the leeds dog dont you
beat and you know the jacobi cat
and the padlock on the door and you know you need a boltcutter and every other goddamn thing cause
shouts beat havent you my man
the phone rings
his attention is riveted on graham
its the guard in the storeroom
to crawford we want the cans the jacobi home movies came in
beat theyre in the far corner of the room under the windows
into phone theres some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows
crawford is very quiet
he found them
graham pushes aside the videotape sleeve and picks up the leeds home movie can
reads label what its going to say on the jacobi film can is the same as it says on the leeds film can gateway lab st
into phone is there a label on the jacobi can that says what lab processed it
then he deflates
to graham no
its bobs photo store in
have him peel the top label back
into phone see if theres another label underneath
crawford hears grahams watching him
it does doesnt it
punches another number i want a chopper on the roof in three minutes
to meigs field
bear at meigs have them warn up and flight prep the gulf stream
grahams already out the door
crawford races after him
has been placed on the kitchen table
it is chrome and pale yellow formica
her face is bruised and swollen from where dollarhyde hit her
she feels around on the bed
shes very frightened
shes trying to control herself
youre scaring me with this
theres no answer
we dont know if theres anyone else in the room
am i alone in this room
are you here
shrill why are you doing this
even some remarkable events have happened in birmingham and atlanta
do you know what im talking about
reba shakes her head
in a low voice two groups of people were changed
the police think they were murdered
beat do you know what they call the being that visited these people
you can say
in a flash dollarhyde grips her mouth shutting off the sound
low think carefully and answer correctly
his arm exits frame
francis did a thing for you today so i couldnt have you
and he was wrong
beat beat give me your hand
rebas hand is gripped by dollarhydes
he brings her fingers up to his face
for the first time in this scene we are seeing dollarhydes face
the fanged dentures are in his mouth
dollarhyde makes rebas hand feel his teeth
we hear reba start whimpering and try to pull away
dollarhyde holds her hand there
now you know how the dragon kills
finishes patching together cables
into radio phone this is jack crawford fbi
who am i speaking to

into phone all we know is this man owns a van and he works at gateway

and we have special stickers for vans
beat about van permits issued
meanwhile graham has grabbed the second radio phone
into phone start feeding me names
two fbi men are at his desk
uniformed patrolmen carrying assault rifles and body armor run through in the background
run these names to your dmv for a drivers license check
man were after is blond caucasian twenty to forty six feet tall pounds

fisk punches graham into the speaker phone
first name jose
one of the uniformed cops is already punching it into a computer terminal
fisk looks at the monitor
into phone no
brown eyes black hair
to crawford no
into phone next
the gulf stream approaches and races past us at its cruising speed of mph
as it leaves the frame the image were left with is the moon
it looms large and white degrees above the horizon and rising into a starry sky displays the license with picture and driving record of dillon lincoln
hes a black man
into phone to graham no
the flashing strobes of the airport runway indicator the cobalt blue runway lights
into pa could you fasten your seat belts

crawford buckles up
graham is hearing

the lines compose hair forehead eyes
coming at us line by line is francis dollarhyde
into phone to lt

where is that
from the airport youre closer
well meet at the hock road off ramp highway
to graham fogel has four more names
he knows two both dark hair
thirds a woman
fourths a handicapped parking permit
re dollarhyde this is our boy
hits the runway
its engines scream in reverse thrust
it taxis away from the terminal to a security area
louis pd squad cars are waiting
grahams out followed by crawford
they run across the tarmac to the squad cars
squad cars race out of the airport
through shadows and highlights in the moonlight
we pass the sink and countertop and refrigerator and blue enamelled broom closet
on the other side of it is reba
she is breathing heavily
she stands there squeezing into the corner trying to make herself disappear
then she senses and freezes as a rabbit who is hunted and at a certain point freezes
stands four feet from her just staring
then he walks from the room
puts innagaddadavida by iron butterfly from on the stereo
it blasts through the house
he is expressionless
deep in his psychotic episode his affect is flattened
as a reflection in the medicine cabinet enters
his fist smashes
his image shatters with the mirrored glass
forearm destroys the glass shower door
he rips the metal frame from the walls
he snaps the mitred framework
the aluminum frame members have sharp degree points
he takes them and the shards of mirror and leaves for the kitchen
throughout his face has been expressionless
streaks towards us down the almost deserted highway
in the back seat
he is distant
his attitude contrasts to the frantic mph race down the highway and the two uniformed officers and crawford
their anxiety is visible
next to them graham seems zoned our
meet points up ahead
go on to the house
go on to the house
he obeys graham and floors it
graham puts his black plastic briefcase on his lap and extracts the
charter arms bulldog
he starts to load matte black blunt nosed glaser safety slugs
he fumbles them in the swaying car
the bullets fall to the floor
glaser safety slugs roll on the rubber matting
grahams fingers enter and pick them up
we follow the rounds as they slip into the cylinder
is staring at grahams blankness
youre not going to need that
because were going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a st
louis pd swat team is going to take him
thats it up ahead
the house is set back a half mile from the road
access to the drive is blocked by a locked cattle gate
cut across the field
beat kill your lights
the first drives off the highway through a shallow ditch and starts across the soybean field
the second car takes the ditch at the wrong angle and crashes
its windshield stars
moving across the furrowed rows
the car starts to slow
we dont know why they are slowing down
spray the gumbo mud out of the furrows
the forward momentum of the car slows until it completely stops
the tires spin and dig in
spills out and starts running for the house and the orchard a quarter mile away
running towards the house through the trees
branches slap at them
ahead the orchard will parallel the house
they can get to within yards using the trees as cover
into radio get the roadblocks set on route three
theres an access road to the back of the house
that ought to be a second teams approach
will graham and i are in an orchard due west of the house
how far aways the back up
graham gestures crawford to a position with a front view of the house
ill cover the back
stay in the trees
as we track with graham through the trees towards the back beyond him we see the side yard and the side windows moving past
the windows are large
at the back like a ramp are two storm cellar doors
in the dark shadows of the trees
he seems to float through the branches and slows and settles quietly
then the ex pression on will grahams face starts to change
a light comes on
then the figure of reba is swung out of a corner past the window
resigned whisper into radio theres somebody in the house jack
radio filter wait for the back up
whispers in radio its happening again jack
on the right we see dollarhydes right arm with the aluminum shafts
beyond them through the window we see graham has stepped out from the tree line
he stands on the grass
he looks helpless
his gun hangs idly at his side
its his worst nightmare
about what hes seeing low stop it
we and graham see dollarhydes arm arc back for an uppercutting thrust into reba
dollarhydes left hand clutching her dress raises her two feet up the wall
and now graham starts running forward
and his face is distorted and hes shouting roars dollarhyde turns to the window in time to see
his arms across his face and his body angled sideways crashes through the glass
catching grahams momentum throws him across the room
crashes off the fridge which opens and spills and hits the floor as
roars and grabs his mm from the kitchen table
is lacerated from the glass
he sees his own blood on the floor
he struggles to rise
the first thing up is the big bore of the
it fires as if it had its own mind
left shoulder explodes
bleeding brings the
down from the recoil of the first shot
now up on one knee he fires four more rounds into dollarhyde
graham stands and walks to dollarhyde
reba is collapsed in the corner
dollarhyde it more exploded from within than shot
graham starts to raise the gun
as we pull back and see arriving squad car flashers play on the walls and crawford runs through the foreground we see graham point the gun down to dollarhydes head
as were pulling away comes the final flash report and
we will only see the rear of will graham sitting alone on the side of the bed in the alienating motel room
his head is bandaged
into phone hello
i was out in the garden
mama came out and told me when she saw it on tv
why didnt you call me
mama was probably asleep

every time they look at me i remind them
if they thought about it theyd want you
bur all they really wants the boy

but they dont want to see me
thats not true
theyre full of shit and they make me sick
then no one says anything
maybe we should give it some time
a little time
beat i tell you what buckaroo
beat see you around
graham slams down the phone
still half immersed in a psychotic landscape of the mind grahams psyche resonates with echoes of dollarhyde
now he gets up and walks out of the room leaving the door open
outside is only the deserted parking lot
its raining the driver moves slowly down a residential street looking for an address
twenty three twenty six
twenty three twenty eight
here you go
pulls up to curb want me to wait
its open plan
the dining area and kitchen are raised
the sherman family are engaged in pm suburban family chaos george sherman is trying to watch the news
he hollers up the stairs for his daughter to turn down her stereo
his year old son fred at the dining room table is supposed to be doing homework
instead he rolls up balls of paper and does jump shots from his chair into the wastepaper can to son cut out the basketball and go back to the algebra
george sherman goes back to nbc news
the doorbell rings
thirteen year old tina sherman comes down the stairs
ill get it
tina opens it
runs to the door
in a wider shot we see there is a sho gun resting inside the door jamb
its within reach or shermans hand
we see why tina sherman screamed
is pulled down slightly on the left side making his left eye moon shaped
there is a half healed wound and butter fly bandage where dollarhyde stabbed him
he is standing in a black raincoat with a black hat
what do you want
are you george sherman
who are you
my names will graham
suddenly realizing who he is oh jesus
to wife honey
his wife starts to come forward
no thats okay
pause how are you
theres a searching look on grahams face
were all well
beat that man crawford called and
beat how bout a drink
coffee or something
no im okay
i just wanted to
beat stop by and
i cant thank you enough i
graham shakes his head
he doesnt want to be thanked
no one knows what to say
graham looks at them
standing in awkward places
they ate nothing special
they are normal human beings living their lives
to graham they are very special they are alive
i just wanted to stop by and
graham stands there as if engraving each one in his memory
then he nods
then he leaves
closes the door
theres an awkward look on his face
he didnt get to say what he wanted to say to graham
in the middle of the frame walks down the sidewalk away from us towards the waiting cab
the rain pelts his black hat and black raincoat
before he reaches the cab
sitting with his back to us
beyond him the sun reflects off the crashing surf and burns out everything except the silhouetted image of graham
the fenced in area of beach he and kevin built at the opening of the film
a baby tortoise crawls over sand mountains and is swept away by surf into the life supporting sea
drinks a beer
he senses a presence and starts to turn
turns towards us
molly enters the frame
her coat is under her arm
she drops it and her flight sag in the sand and continues walking to graham
stands as she comes near him
the aqua highlights of the water eat into their figures as they look at each other
molly touches the wounded side of his face
then lets forget who said what to whom
you got a deal
graham takes mollys hand
molly and graham walk to the waters edge and look out to sea
the highlights burn out sections of the two people
so howd we do
graham looks at her
he touches the side of her cheek and her hair
she pushes against his hand with her face to make closer contact
we did okay
beat most of them made it
graham in the sunbleached violet shorts lays an arm across mollys shoulder
mollys arm moves around grahams waist
they look out to sea
in front of them the surf kicks up drops of spray which take light and become brilliant atoms
