screenplay by tom butterworth and jez butterworth in a russian summer meadow a young girl spins around and around
a simple guitar theme plays as the low sun catches her hair
around her neck is a pair of field binoculars and she runs through the meadow with them pressed to her face spying butterflies birds rabbits
she reaches the top of a hillock and jumps into the air and flies up into the sky
we float up and up with her as she aims the binoculars up up into the sun
an aerial shot of the rolling english countryside
nothing but fields and trees for miles
the shot describes a panorama before looking directly down at the earth and we begin to move
we fly low over a field a ditch and straight out over six lanes of motorway
cars and lorries tear below at a hundred miles an hour
we fly over the hard shoulder to another field beyond
we descend on two young boys in the field
a pornographic magazine is spread out of the flattened grass
one of the boys puts a match to the centre page and as the flames lick up we begin to move again across the field over a path and into
a suburban garden
we fly over five or six gardens over a barbecue over children splashing in a pool over a woman sunbathing a man mowing his lawn a young boy bouncing up
and down on a garden trampoline to arrive on the patio of john buckingham
he walks out onto the patio where he sits in a chair facing his house setting down a mug of tea
a blurred face sharpening into focus john buckingham about thirty two sitting on his patio his garden behind fields beyond
his hand adjusts a microphone on his lapel
he shifts in his chair
he looks straight at us
i dont believe in perfect love
you know love that comes out of the sky like a thunderbolt and uh
this is ridiculous
he removes the microphone
he sits there thinking very hard
no no no
he stands turns and stretches
he is sitting as before looking at us
films if theyre good
someone intelligent of course
pretty i suppose
but its not critical
john watches while two removal men lift a new double bed from the back of a van
someone with a sense of humour
someone you can communicate with on the same level
someone you can really talk to
i think communication is key
johns hands smooth a crisp white sheet over the double mattress
an ant runs across the sheet
john squashes it and picks it carefully off
i think that by the time most people turn thirty they know where theyre going
john encircles his house leaving a thick trail of yellow powder behind him
and where theyve been
i suppose they have some baggage stroke history
we see that john is talking to his pc
it has a small digital camera on the side
we all have someone in our past who uh
one skeleton if you like
weve all got at least one person as it were under the patio
not literally of course
i suppose i only say this because i always thought people who did this sort of thing were
i had an image that they were losers
a bit sad
but i think this is the modern world
and i think really its quite a brave move
quite a brave reasonable thing to do
sorry can we start again
johns fingers in close up type john buckingham and his amex number into his pc
finished he stops and rests his face on his hands
he hits send
that instant a worry of black crows bursts up in the field behind him and takes to the swirling air
the titles pop and slide over footage of russian women on computer video advertising themselves
they mostly speak in russian some of which is subtitled some speak in english
the women slide on and off the screen overlap and collide as the titles appear
close ups on mouths and eyes tight and pixellated
it becomes a wall of image and sound
the gigantic underside of a boeing tears down the screen
john slides across the screen motionless towards arrivals
last calls for flights leaving for the other side of the world
travellers criss cross and swirl
ba moscow on time
he dries his face with a paper towel then checks himself in the mirror
he looks okay a little white
the arrivals gate slides open and passengers flood through
john stands among the chauffeurs and cab drivers as the passengers trundle by
we follow one young woman long enough to think this must be her but its a false alarm shes lifted up and spun around by someone else
theyve all passed
she wasnt on the flight
john wanders away from the gate
he stands about in the swirl in the middle of the airport
people bustle by
everyone going somewhere
gradually we get the sense we are being watched
a woman stands nearby
she is about twenty very beautiful tired and laden with luggage
they shake hands
look i didnt have a speech but
a distorted passenger announcement breaks above us
its too loud to talk
it ends and they stand there in silence
he points to her luggage
is that everything
they stand there
nadia and john stand side by side in a huge lift
we can talk in the car
a deafening roll of thunder
its pouring with rain as they cross the car park towards a patched up yellow rover
john stows the suitcase in the boot and opens the passenger door for her
john turns the key in the ignition
the mg wheezes and coughs
he tries again
the third time it just catches and he coaxes it to life
the colours drained from his cheeks
they head for the motorway
the silence in the car lasts just long enough for john to feel he is breaking it
its about forty miles from here
i dont know if youve looked at a map its close to london but its a city in itself
a roman city
its a nice house
im having a problem with ants
its the warmer weather
i cant seem to find the nest
sorry do you understand ants
i just cant find a nest
the root of the problem
ive looked everywhere
whats the russian for ant
sorry thats a stupid
this is strange isnt it
im pretty nervous
ive got a problem with ants
he shakes his head
i had this
he pulls a sign from his jacket which says nadia
as a joke but uh
he tosses it onto the back seat
he sees nadia looking at england
is it different to how you imagined it
pause what about me
am i how you imagined
he double takes changes lanes
and how was the flight
sorry am i speaking too fast for you
john looks across
can you follow me
do you understand what im saying
or should i speak slower
do you follow or should i speak slower
he looks across
back at the road
he changes gear
are you a giraffe
john turns to face the road ahead
to himself oh jesus
he drives in silence
suddenly she winds the window down and vomits out of the speeding car
john panics and swerves onto the hard shoulder amidst loud horn blasts
john navigates his way round the rover in the rain to find her kneeling on the verge throwing up
he puts a hand on her shoulder but she stands up quickly maintaining an icy dignity considering what has just happened
it has stopped raining and a group of young boys are playing cricket in the road
they clear as a yellow rover pulls into the close and into the drive of the little house at the end
as john climbs out of his car he eyes the boys
the boys eye him and his new friend
the front door closes behind them
john and nadia stand in the silence of his hallway
there is a small banner hanging there welcome nadia
they study the banner together gravely
eventually he opens a door
she peers round him and looks inside
he leads her down towards the kitchen
she glances around it
then back at john
he nods to himself looking tense and pale
he puts her suitcase down on the landing and opens a door
without looking inside bathroom
he closes it
standing in the doorway of johns bedroom
there it is
the double bed
john frowns gravely
without warning he marches out
she comes out onto the landing to catch john plus suitcase kicking open another door and vanishing inside
nadia peers around the door to find john standing next to a narrow monk like single bed
the other bedroom
she looks at it then up at john
she turns and walks out
now shes back with her camouflaged hold all dumps it onto the floor heaves the suitcase onto the bed and smoking no hands starts unpacking
john plugs in the lamp by the bed
to show nadia how it works he switches it on off on off and then feels stupid
ill get an ashtray
with john gone nadia stops unpacking
she walks to the window and stares out over the rooftops of the estate
john on the phone
you have reached from russia with love
our office reopens on monday
if you are interested in our services
this is john buckingham from st albans
i need to speak to you urgently
theres a critical problem
call me back as soon as possible
john climbs the stairs holding a saucer for an ashtray
he knocks lightly on the spare room door
nadia is lying asleep on the bed in only her black underwear
we duck straight back out
john composes himself
he puts his head back round the door as if theres a real chance it will be shot off
shes facing away arms folded still holding the cigarette
it has burnt out leaving a long curl of ash on her bare hip
he approaches the bed with immense trepidation eases the cigarette from between her fingers and drops it in the bin
he stares at her bare hip with the ash on it
holding the saucer under the ash he blows on it gently
it takes three careful breaths before it drops in the saucer
unseen by john her eyes are wide open as he steals out onto the landing
we stay with her a moment
a pot of stew bubbling on the hob
john is stirring a pot on the hob
by his expression he might be defusing a bomb
his head cocks he stiffens
nadia walks right into the kitchen
shes changed jeans and a tee shirt
nadia takes the spoon from him says something in russian gestures for him to sit
she tastes the stew
now she stirs the pot
he watches her
john and nadia sit opposite each other
she takes a mouthful
they catch one anothers eye
on the wall across six ants careen in crazy circles
john can see them but doesnt move
he puts his fork down
i dont know what to say
your letters were in english
you said youd studied english
nadia reaches down into her bag and pulls out a small box wrapped in brown paper
she places it in front of him
he warily unwraps a little wooden box
he opens the lid and fishes out a simple gold ring
he holds it in his palm
i cant take this
he puts it back in the box hoping it will disappear
she fishes it out again and holds it on her palm for him to take
i cant take it
im not really a ring guy
she takes his hand
he automatically yanks it away like hes been burned
she takes his hand again and to stop it becoming unbearable he allows nadia to push the ring onto his ring finger
it goes on easily
no big deal
john and nadia sit next to each other on the couch watching t
johns gaze seems to go through the t
and a thousand yards beyond
nadia is knitting a half finished jumper blood red
john stands and disappears out of shot
if anyone gets this message please call as soon as possible
its an emergency
john sits back down
he steals side glances at her
her red painted fingers knitting fast
john flips through the channels the money programme
eventually he offers nadia the remote control
she takes aims it at the t
but doesnt press it
just as it seems she wont she does university challenge
they watch university challenge with nadia still aiming the control and smoking
after another long pause she flips the button the money programme
she flips again then hands the controls back to john and they watch university challenge
nadia puts down her knitting stretches and yawns
nadia climbs the stairs
john watches her hovering in the doorway of the darkened lounge
he hears the bathroom door close before venturing up
john sits on the edge of his bed
he cocks his head door opening and shutting feet padding along landing door closing
he squeezes his door open and peers down the dark landing
the coast is clear
brushing his teeth staring accusingly at his reflection
finished he takes a deep breath and opens the door and gives a small shout
nadia is standing right outside the door nightshirt damp hair toothbrush in her mouth
he squeezes past and quick steps down the landing
he climbs into the big bed fully clothed turns off the light and lies there in the moonlight
after twenty seconds the bedroom door clicks open
john climbs out of bed as casually as possible and stands around
you should go now
well talk in the morning
his eyes widen but he cant speak
he wants to but shes placed her hand across his mouth
she reaches down and takes his hand and draws it towards her slowly tracing his fingers across her breasts
she unbuttons her shirt and pulls his hand inside
hes breathing hard her right hand still clasped over his mouth
her free hand lowers to press against him and unzip his fly
he lets out a moan
we concentrate on their faces
above the silence all we can hear is johns breathing before long nadia looks down hes come
nadia turns and walks out leaving john marooned gasping in and blowing out angry almost buttoning his trousers
exterior view of johns darkened house
a fox trots across the cul de sac and sits under johns car where it curls up
john lying in bed staring out at a streetlight
nadia opens her eyes in the sun filled room
she pads down the hall in her nightshirt and opens the door to the bathroom
there on the toilet naked is john
he gives another short shout
nadia holds his eye for a couple of seconds too long before shutting us inside with him
john sprints down his lawn scattering the big black crows eating his garden
he jumps the fence and across the fields
john jogs along by a river in the countryside behind his house wearing shorts and a tee shirt
his breath billows around him in the sharp morning air
he stops running by a gate overlooking a small hill
he doubles up to recover panting hard
two wild rabbits are nibbling the remains of a big breakfast left on the lawn
john climbs heavily back over his fence
theres a deck chair out there surrounded by the remains of breakfast
some glossy russian magazines a full ashtray nadias knitting
the patio door is ajar the net curtain billowing
he scans the garden jumpily
the boy next door is on his trampoline bouncing up and down watching john at the top of each bounce
sweating from the run john peers up the stairs
the house is silent
in the lounge he picks up the phone and dials a number
you have reached from russia with love
if you are interested
he hangs up
john stands with his ear to the bathroom door
the showers on
he slips inside
cigarette cartons several lighters spare wool suitcase rucksack
huge poster of bruce springsteen on wall
warily he opens the bedside drawer different coloured bras and knickers
in her open suitcase lies a small wooden chest
he lifts it out and puts it on the bed hesitates then opens it
a pair of russian army field binoculars
he puts them on the bed beside him
a small silver pistol the size of a derringer
he studies it and pulls the trigger
its a cigarette lighter
a brochure of prospective husbands provided by the marriage agency
after a dozen or so photos he comes across his page but the photo has been cut out
he sees his name in the strange lettering under the hole
nadia in the shower eyes shut water pouring over her face
john flicks through a stack of photographs
one of nadia as a young girl in a meadow with binoculars around her neck john looks at the same binoculars on the bed next to him
he turns them over in his hands
he looks through them
he slowly lowers them
hes seen something
he stands and crosses the room
on the mantelpiece in a silver frame is his picture cut from the brochure
he holds it in his hands
the shower has stopped
in a panic he replaces the picture the photographs the gun lighter the brochure and the binoculars
nadia leaves the bathroom hair wrapped in a towel and heads straight towards us
john shuts the chest drops it back into the suitcase
the photo of the binoculars girl is on the pillow
he whips it under the bed just as nadia enters
she doesnt seem surprised to see him standing there in her room in his tee shirt and running shorts
this isnt going to work
its been a terrible mistake
you must go
he takes the ring off and holds it out to her
she doesnt take it
he puts it on the bed
im booking a flight for tomorrow
john and nadia on her bed nadia tearing off his tee shirt
she gets on top
the milkman hops a low fence between two houses
he waves to a man watering his rose trees
john and nadia having sex
they dont take their eyes off each other
a mother corrals her school children into a volvo
they dont want to go
john sits on the edge of the bed holding his head in his hands
the door has just shut behind him
he looks at his left hand
he has the ring on
john identifies most problems within appropriate time frames
the large oak doors of the bank swing open
most of the time he develops several alternative solutions to problems
we move fast through the banking hall to the furthest counter
the blind snaps up to reveal john wearing a smart suit
he usually resolves or minimises most problems before they grow into larger problems
johns skilled hands loading a stack of banknotes into a drawer
the cashier next along clare smiles at him
do anything special
john listens and comprehends well
john sits in front of a large desk hands on knees
when communicating he is good at selecting the most efficient methods and displays effective verbal communication skills
across the desk the branch manager reads a report out loud in an impersonal flat manner
on one occasion john showed first class communication skills in a delicate customer situation
nadia opens a kitchen cupboard and stares inside at johns groceries
john is reasonably quick to volunteer whenever others need help
although he is sometimes reluctant and or unwilling to ask for it himself
she opens some pickled onions and pops one in her mouth
cradling the jar of onions she scans his bookshelf
he is adequate at resolving difficult or emotional customer situations
bluffers guide to the internet
she opens an old copy of the lion the witch and the wardrobe
inside is written john buckingham class f
he usually fulfills commitments made to customers within expected time frames
she opens the wardrobe
in a shoebox she finds some photos
john shows a high degree of respect for customers
one of john as a little boy holding a football flanked by his parents
on the back someone has written summer
john still has some reluctance to or has problems in carving out new relationships face to face
there is a photo of john about three years ago arm in arm with a plain thin looking girl with small eyes
another of him kissing her on the cheek
judgment john makes able decisions in most areas of his job
nadia sees something at the bottom of the cupboard
she bends down to retrieve a black dustbin liner
she reaches in and pulls out a small stack of hardcore pornographic magazines
john follows instructions conscientiously and responds well to personal directions
she upends the bag and a half dozen videos fall out
she picks up a magazine and begins flicking through it impassively
nadia downstairs kneels in front of the t
and slips a video into the machine
nadias face is lit up by the screen
the sound of sex
john is normally very punctual and in most situations assumes responsibility for his own actions and outcomes
she pops a pickled onion in her mouth and watches
we see the images close and pixellated as we did the marriage videos in the titles
its a bondage scene the woman wears a gag
john back in the room
the report has finished and the manager is scrutinising him in silence
thank you i think thats very fair
john drives his rover through the centre of town the low orange sun on his face
the rover pulls into the driveway
john opens the glove compartment and removes the ring nadia gave him and puts it back on
he collects a brown paper package from the passenger seat
john and nadia at the supper table
she is knitting the jumper
despite the silence john seems more relaxed in shirtsleeves and loosened tie
he puts his fork down and places the brown bag on the table pushing it across to nadia
she opens it and removes a big hardback russian english dictionary
john smiles and nods open it
she flicks through it
she turns it over in her hands nods puts the book down reaches under the table and surfaces with the stack of porn magazines
she puts them on the table next to the dictionary
john beholds the pile
wet n wild is on top
he rises slowly from the table and sleepwalks from the kitchen
john frozen headed floats down the hall up the stairs into the bathroom locks the door sits on the toilet
downstairs nadia clears the dishes
the porn stack still sits on the table beside the dictionary
still on the toilet
he hasnt moved
he closes his eyes
the bathroom door opens a crack
the coast clear he dashes for the cover of his bedroom
john rests his head against the doorframe and heaves a sigh of relief
he turns and freezes
nadia is there next to him
she slowly loosens his tie
holding it in her hands she examines the strange little bank logo on it before deliberately tying the tie over her mouth like a gag
a second tie is pulled from a hanger in the cupboard
quickly and skillfully she ties her hands together pulling it tight with her teeth
finished she flicks her hair back and gives him a long level look
it will feel very strange at first but then you get used to it
a close up of johns face
he closes his eyes falls backwards and is caught in the arms of a colleague
john stands again and closes his eyes
after a short wait he falls back and again his colleague catches him just before he hits the ground
how does that feel john
it feels good
its called trust and letting go
trust and letting go
a simple guitar theme begins and plays over the following sequence kids playing cricket in johns close
a boy hits the ball and others chase it as it bounces off cars
john at dusk tied to the bed with his two bank ties
nadia is on top
they are having sex
hands stacking bank notes into the back of a cash machine
at the bank john walks to his desk
his phone rings
he answers it
then soft breathing
john listens intently and looks around
john sits there surrounded by his colleagues listening to nadia breathe
close up on a mans hands tying a tie tight a round a womans wrist
pull back to a close up of nadias face her eyes fixed on john
john running by the river
john watches nadia rise from his bed after sex and leave the room
he stares out the window
nadias fingers knitting skillfully
nadia sits on her bed alone pulling on black stockings and attaching them to suspenders
the street cricketers run for cover as a thunder storm breaks over the close
rain coming down in johns garden
the pair sit under the shelter of the back porch
john has his hands out as nadia is winding red wool it into a ball
the jumper is half finished
the rabbits shelter from the rain under broad leaves
john in a pub with a four colleagues from the bank
he sips his half half listening to the conversation
it all seems so dull
he finishes his drink and looks at his watch
they ask him if hes staying for another
a knitting needle is drawn from a row of red stitches on the nearly finished jumper
nadia kneels over john holding the knitting needles
she presses one to his skin and we watch it drawn across his chest in close up up to his neck
his eyes are fixed on hers
close up on nadias face
her mouth is gagged and shes lying on her front head half buried in a pillow
we can just make out john behind on top of her
both are lying still and breathing hard covered in sweat
catching her breath nadia yanks the gag off and wriggles out from underneath him
she snatches up a towel and covering herself hurries to the bathroom
the guitar theme ends
john presses his ear to the bathroom door
the sound of retching
the toilet flushes
john pads back to his bedroom
through the gap in the door he sees nadia coming out go to her room and shut the door
he rests his head against the door frame
a beautiful morning
through the patio window john watches nadia in the garden sitting on the lawn reading her dictionary in the sunlight
in dungarees with her hair up she looks very young
he walks warily out into the sunlight
she looks up then back to the big book in her lap
he places the tea next to her on the grass
are you o
she looks at him then down at her tome
she speaks slowly in a heavy accent today is bath day
she studies her book
today is bath day
he shakes his head
i dont understand
happy bath day
the penny drops
john leafs through the dictionary
syevodnya happy birthday
he puts his hand on her shoulder
john nods smiling
she lights a cigarette from the butt of her last
she holds the jumper up to john as if to try it for size and the theme returns
john is on the telephone
it might just be a twenty four hour bug
clare listens concerned
well you just get better
ill tell beaky
you just get some rest ok
john puts the phone down
he looks down the hall where nadia is killing ants on the table with her dictionary
a shot from above of the rovers windscreen reflecting the passing trees
the roof is down
we glide up the windscreen up nadias body in the passenger seat
her face is upturned slightly shes wearing sunglasses which reflect the passing trees
nadia sits alone at the dining room table
suddenly the lights go out
john enters carrying a small birthday cake glowing with candles
the light throws huge shadows on the walls and flickers across their faces
he sets the cake down on the table and sits down opposite nadia happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
happy birthday dear nadia
the front doorbell rings
a loud long burst
nadias face transforms into a big grin
she hurries out into the hall leaving john alone with the cake
nadia whooping and shouting excitedly
shouting in russian
a man bursts in carrying nadia in his arms
he spins her round in the candlelight kisses her puts her down and goes to the table where he blows out the candles
they are plunged into darkness
lots of whooping and laughing
a zippo flares up and illuminates some faces all laughing
johns hand groping along the wall
it finds the light switch
there are two men here
one small and wiry one big and dark like rasputin
they each carry rucksacks and a guitar case
you must be john
you seem very nice
in russian the first man introduces nadia to the other man who is relighting the candles with a zippo
it seems they havent met before
the first man yuri pulls out a bottle of vodka and hands it to john
we cant drink our piss can we
hang on hang on sorry but like who are you
you must find some glasses small for the toast and some plates
what are you doing here

nadia begins gabbling to yuri in russian
yuri says the english word friends

he says he feels safe here
nadia talks fast to yuri
she says she wanted to tell you but her english is shit
and no one speaks russian its very hard for her

alexei turns off the light again
nadia blows out her candles
they are plunged back into darkness
john turns the light on again
yuri is already sitting down

yuri stands we are russian
he sits down and

he hands john another bottle of vodka

vodka is splashed into their glasses
yuri raises his glass and shouts a toast in russian vashe zdarovye
they down their vodka john sips at his then realises he must finish it
yuri makes as if to throw his in the fireplace
sausages cheese bread and pickle bottles rain onto the table from yuris rucksack
to yuri so hang on

yuri speaks to nadia in russian she replies looking at john
what was that
i asked her if you were happy to see us
i find it hard to tell with you
yes its okay
thank you for the food
nadia lights a cigarette
john notices that on both wrists she has bold red marks from the ties
she says you are a little shy
i think i know this
john is thrown panicking that one of them will notice the marks
so how long will you be in england
plans are for the architects politicians and so forth
you must have a visa or something
youre asking for my documents
yuri laughs translates for alexei and they both get a big laugh out of this
yuri gets his passport out and makes a big show of presenting it to john
but john keeps glancing at the marks on nadias wrists
we see a close up of her neck
there is the tiniest blood mark
john sees it and starts to sweat
we are all europeans here
europe tony blair and maggie thatcher
yuri raises his glass and they all drink to tony blair and margaret thatcher
john drinks his vodka in two hot gulps
you have nothing to say to your fiancee
maybe to wife of forty years its understandable
you speak and i will translate
john looks glazed
the room falls silent
yuri translates she replies
she says hello to you
go for it john
do you like england
he translates thank god
she says yes
he watches nadia tap ash
the wrist again
they all wait
yuri nods encouragingly
i cant think of anything
nadia speaks in russian to yuri
she says she has a secret to tell
john waits uncomfortably
she says she watched you at the airport
translating i saw you waiting there by the gate
i have these uh
she explains to you
when i was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses
i dont know the word
like for watching uh
for watching the birds
we see johns face
he had these binoculars he has kept from the war
a young girl runs through a summer meadow with a pair of russian army field binoculars around her neck
i would run around with them taking pictures of things i liked with my mind
if i saw something beautiful i would take a picture
with the binoculars pressed to her face she spies butterflies birds a rabbit
she stops running and aims the binoculars up up into the sun yuri translates
the day before i left russia my father gave me the old binoculars
he said that when i saw you i was to stand far away and look at you with these and to examine your face closely
and if you were a bad person i could run away
nadia looks at the table
she says she took a picture
john watches nadia looking at the table
she glances up once and catches his eye
alexei suddenly slams his hand down on the table
he raises his palm
there is an ant squashed there
he shows yuri
the small party has moved outside to the patio where they sit around a low wooden table in the mellow candlelight
a huge late summer moon hangs over the fields
alexei tinkles beautifully on his guitar
he stops asks a question in russian
what was that
it is too judgmental
tell me what he said
he says why did you send to russia for a wife
john suddenly looks sick
you are not ashamed of it
its no surprise to want to love
its not that
do you believe in love
i suppose its
i mean define your terms
its very strange
how many people are truly themselves with their love
it is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers
there are no marches against heartache no ministries against loneliness no concerts against disappointment
we look away
and still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us
the one thing we all share but dont say
look john i will show you something
he takes a plate and starts reaching for the food
here look something beautiful from russia
here is life there take it
john accepts the plate
here is bread
this is work
we all need this here eat
but we cannot survive with just work so here is meat and blood
this is family and country flesh strength eat
john bites the sausage
but again this is not life
here is joy and pain
without these life has no flavour is too serious
john nibbles some pickled garlic
but this vodka
pause is love
only this magic changes you inside
the moon and the stars and the sun
yuri offers john the glass
he looks at nadia takes it and swigs it down in one
he looks across at nadia wiping his mouth his eyes watering
she looks back at him
alexei begins softly singing a song
as he sings this is a love song a soldiers song to his beloved alexei hes afghanstya a veteran of afghanistan
he saw terrible things
they listen to the beautiful sad voice
for the second verse yuri joins in a slow stirring lament
for the end nadia joins in too and the three of them begin harmonising beautifully
john watches in the candlelight
john nadia and alexei pose with the cake
nadia puts her arm round john and alexei
with a flash
yuri takes a polaroid
the guitar theme returns as we see the polaroid on the table in close up developing speeded up
john comes into focus beaming
we track across the sleeping faces of yuri and alexei tucked into their sleeping bags with guitar cases for pillows
john switches the light off and closes the door
john and nadia seen from above lying asleep with their heads together in the moonlight
nadia whispers something in her sleep in russian
fast asleep john mutters something in english
their sleeping unintelligible conversation drifts on in the night
john sits at his desk in the open plan office
he looks nervous
this is because he is wearing nadias ring
people pass his desk a couple say hello but they dont notice
he rubs his chin
eventually his manager approaches
quick word john
he leans over the desk
this is sensitive
doesnt necessarily give the right impression
to customers approaching the bank from the rear thrown right
you can see why its sensitive
the manager smiles and taps the desk twice
ill leave it on your desk
john is left alone
the front door opens and john walks into his hall
the two rucksacks are still side by side where they were the night before
he opens the fridge and pours himself a glass of orange
he stops there on the draining board lies the bloody skin of a rabbit
john jumps out of his skin
next to the rabbit skin is a hand drawn map
a dotted line winds around the map and ends with an x in a small wood
he looks at the rabbit skin with its eyeless sockets
john follows a path through a big silent wood the low sun flaring and catching his white work shirt
through binoculars a long way off and squinting into the sun
nadia lowers the binoculars and looks past us
john spots some figures lying on the grass in the distance
he heads towards them and watches them for a moment from thirty yards away
alexei yuri and nadia sit in a small clearing
a blanket cushions bread and vodka are scattered around
yuri is strumming a guitar
alexei and nadia are laughing and chatting
he removes a small twig from her hair and flattens it under his big hand
john watches the gesture
its so intimate they could be lovers
we can see you hiding
john steps out of his hiding place and approaches the group
alexei has nadia falling about laughing about something
he smiles at her then nods to john
pieces of cooked rabbit lie in tin foil
alexei feeds a piece to nadia with a big hunting knife
nadia smiles at john and starts knitting
how is bank
i thought you were leaving today
to be indoors on such a day
nadia stops knitting and takes her shirt off and stretches back to sunbathe in her black bra
alexei takes the knife he has just finished cleaning and holds the cold wide blade flat above nadias bare stomach
just before pressing it down he looks across at john
nadia yelps and sits up
they laugh and yuri joins in
john laughs uneasily
alexei notices marks on nadias midriff
he asks her about them in russian
john goes white unable to understand nadias explanation
he has no idea what she told him
at sunset the four run towards a lake in their underwear
they jump and dive in and begin splashing each other
john duck dives under the water and swims through the sunlit streaked green water
we see him under the water swimming towards us caught by the suns rays
john surfaces and wipes the water from his eyes
he spots alexei and nadia playing in the water
alexei grabs her and throws her in the air and she comes down with a splash
john treads water nearby
he watches them both hold their noses and disappear under the surface
theyve both vanished
john ducks under the water
johns underwater p
its too murky to see anything
the two surface breathing hard laughing
john watches them
alexei holds nadia tight and looks like he might even kiss her
but instead he ducks her and holds her under the water
john treads water nearby
shes been under a long time
john begins to swim toward alexei
just as he gets near alexei lets nadia surface coughing and spluttering she shouts at alexei in russian angry
alexei makes for her again but she pushes him away twice almost slapping him
she is very uncomfortable
she swims away
yuri admonishes his friend in russian
alexei stares at john then swims off powerfully back towards the shore
hes just having fun
hes maybe too strong you know
john watches nadia walk out of the lake towards her clothes
john walks into his bedroom
nadia is on the bed with a dictionary
she puts it down
she speaks very slowly
john stands at the end of the two sleeping bags
im so sorry you can stay tonight
i have brought you trouble
maybe i should have come alone
alexei stares at john as he backs out of the room
john closes his bedroom door and slips back into bed
nadia is already asleep
john lies back in the moonlight and stares at the ceiling
a light summer rain
drips fall from rose petals
john opens his eyes
he rolls over towards nadia but shes already up and about
alone in his bedroom john holds the now finished jumper up to himself
he tries it on
its a good four sizes too big the arms are too long and it hangs down to mid thigh
he looks at himself in the mirror and smiles
he pads downstairs in his pants picks up his mail from the doormat and peers into the living room
the sleeping bags and guitar cases have gone
about to peruse his mail his eye is caught by something else
there is a small wild deer standing in the living room
looking at him
john stares back at it transfixed when he hears a scream
the deer starts and bolts out of the patio doors
john is thrown
it was a womans scream
he goes back out and looks down the hall
twenty feet away down the hall is yuri sitting on the kitchen floor his back to the cooker
you must call the police
suddenly alexei steps between them in the doorway
as he moves out of view we see he is holding his hunting knife
john hears nadia cry out from inside the kitchen
he drops his mail and rushes forward
nadia is tied to a chair
alexei pulls a gag tight around her mouth and holds the knife to her throat
what are you doing
alexei shouts at yuri in russian
john im sorry
its my fault
alexei shouts again
nadia is frozen with terror
whats he doing
what the fuck are you doing
leave her alone
alexei addresses john
he says sit down
or hell cut her
alexei and yuri shout at each other
nadia begins crying
sit down please
john sits across the table from nadia
tell him to stop and let her go and well talk
the kettle boils
alexei takes the kettle and holds it over nadias head
john springs up
put the fucking kettle down
put the fucking kettle down
tell yuri tell him put it down or im going to make him
yuri translates alexei replies
he says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers
john he is a soldier
a trained killer
we must do what he says
what does he want
what did he say
he says you are very sad ridiculous man
i dont agree of course
and that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute
nadia is a prostitute
what does he want
the russian shithead
what do you want
he wants money
tell him to put the kettle down and ill give him money
yuri translates this for alexei
alexei has a reply
he wants a lot of money
ill give him money
tell him to put the
he wants the money from your bank
ill fuckin give it to him
well go down there
you dont understand
he wants all the money that is in your bank
ive got eight hundred pounds
the penny drops
he is sure you can do this
of course you can not
of course i cant
alexei doesnt need the translation he tilts the kettle and a small amount of boiling water trickles onto nadias hair
she screams through the gag
john tries to reach across to her but alexei draws the knife and holds it to his face
just leave her alone
im so sorry
leave her alone
close up on nadias terrified eyes imploring john to help her
john drives grim faced through the morning rain
yuri is next to him staring ahead at the road
alexei is in the back with nadia who is still bound and gagged
hes holding his knife to her ribs
the car parks on the top floor
john turns off the engine
he looks at nadia in his rear view mirror but she seems in shock
john strides towards us down st
albans high street carrying the two guitar cases his raincoat flapping
his eyes look glazed the busy street sounds around him muffled
the doors slide apart and john enters his branch
the place is full of customers
he cheeks himself through the security door and into the back
john walks through the open plan office
his branch manager is there with another bank official and clare
this is robert moseley head of south east new business
robert this is john buckingham
i thought you could give us the tour this morning
sort of be our indian guide
the guitars do you play
hes always surprising you with hidden talents
i used to be in a band
sort of like very loud uh very loud marillion
to john well maestro give us a tune
ill give you a tune later
the branch manager takes john to one side and stage whispers
take the ball and run with it john
john leads the team down the corridor past the training room where his colleagues are busy with trust and letting go
this is uh
this is the uh
a colleague passes carrying a file
give us a tune
ill give you a tune later
they enter the training room
this is where were doing trust and uh
trust and letting go
were not doing this till the fourth quarter has it uh any results has it been been beneficial
its weird at first
sort of exciting and frightening at the same time
wouldnt you say john
were starting to see results
this is karen whos uh
they say hello to each other and moseley asks her a couple of questions
john nips out and fetches his guitar cases
he rounds the corner down a couple of steps
he checks himself into the safe area
a colleague passes him
hey moseleys here
ill give you a tune later
john punches in the security code
he opens the safe door and goes inside closing it behind him
we see his stricken face peering through the toughened glass
robert moseley falls backwards into the arms of an employee
its weird isnt it
a little bored perhaps moseley gazes out through the open door
john bowling out of the safe room backwards heaving two guitar cases
one bursts open spilling bundles of fifties onto the floor
moseley the branch manager clare and five trust and letting go catchers all watch
john scoops up the money refasten the case and stand to see them all watching him as the five trust and letting go fallers crash to the ground in unison
john hauls ass towards us straight down the middle of the road a guitar case in either hand footsteps clapping loudly on the wet cobbles
alarms sound dogs bark
he skis around a corner and sprints up this other street
we are close by his head as he sprints one hundred metres
running flat out across the car park
yuri throws open the car door and john hurls the guitar cases inside
he dives in turns the key in the ignition
the rover coughs and wheezes
he tries again
it spits and misfires
the third time it catches and lives
john grinds the gears and lurches off
the rover hurtles down the ramps
it careens down a side street
alexei opens one of the cases and looks inside
he takes a deep breath and swears in russian
he shows what is in the case to nadia
her eyes widen
alexei gently lowers the gag and kisses her on the mouth
she returns the kiss hungrily
john spots them in the mirror and nearly crashes the car
he looks desperately across at yuri
yuri is now pointing the big knife at johns ribs
the russian shrugs almost apologetically
in the back seat nadia has freed herself and is beginning to pull at alexeis clothes
they begin making out passionately
johns eyes slowly lose focus
he turns grey then white
he drives and we watch the life seep out of him
cars tear through the night along the carriage way past a happy eater
we pan round across the motorway to a single storey run down motel
a crusty motel chalet
yuri and alexei are sitting on a double bed counting the money
is on in the corner with the sound turned down and there are empty miniatures from the mini bar scattered around
nadia appears from the kitchenette area
they all seem more relaxed more themselves as if what weve seen before was an act
for the first time in the film their conversation appears as english subtitles
alexei says ssshhh he is counting in his head
to yuri you first
sixty four thousand eight hundred
theres over eighty thousand here
they look at each other absorbing the moment
he lies back on the bed and chuckles
put it in the cases
split it up
and dont forget you owe me
you know what for
no i dont
i got you those trousers from paul smith
ive been buying you stuff all week
ive been buying him stuff all week
nadia is smiling at them as they squabble
when we went to the hard rock cafe
when we went to see cats
those arent presents
thats normal friendship stuff i paid for those guitar cases
what was cats like
it was alright
yeah it was okay
it was quite good actually
some bits i really liked
the sets were good
the sets were excellent
everything was big you know all the rubbish coke cans sweet wrappers dustbins so when you were watching it you felt cat size
it was really clever
yuri goes into the bathroom leaving nadia and alexei alone on the bed
alexei runs his hand across nadias cheek
how many times did you have to fuck him
yuri in the bathroom he undoes his flies pees
at the other end of the bathroom tied to the bidet gagged is john
how you doing
john refuses to meet his eye
yuri flushes and wipes his hands
ill show you something
it should make all this easier i think
from his back pocket yuri takes out an old envelope
he opens it and removes a dozen or so polaroids
john looks down at the first polaroid
nadia alexei and a man john doesnt recognise at a birthday party
there is a cake with candles and everyone is smiling
the next picture is the same
and the next
sometimes germany sometimes france but otherwise the pictures are the same each fiancee beaming with his arm round nadia alexei looking on
john studies the faces of his fellow dupes and at last comes to his own picture
despite himself tears come to his eyes
not all these bastards were like you believe me
you should not too feel bad
yuri takes johns left hand and pulls off nadias ring
he puts it in his pocket
alexei smokes on the bed
nadia is lying the other way
she holds her hand out for his cigarette and he passes it
they have the relaxed air of longtime lovers
its enough isnt it
what do you mean
you know what i mean babe its enough
we can stop
do you want to stop
well stop then
he takes her hand and notices the tie marks on her wrists
i burnt myself
thats not a burn
i did it cooking
they sit there looking at each other
on both wrists
nadia looks back at him
the seconds pass
i did it cooking
alexei studies her face
she pulls a face
he keeps staring
they sit there in silence
alexei is so big and she is so small
listen i made you something
nadia leans over the bed and searches in her bag
alexei watches her closely
she comes back up with the jumper she has knitted
put it on
he looks at the jumper then back at her
its taken me weeks
i want to see you in it
she starts pulling at his shirt
eventually he pulls the jumper on
it fits perfectly
do you like it
he is still staring at her
say thank you
she takes his hands
he is still looking at her
he strokes his hair
he places his big hand around her throat and holds it there holding her at arms length
she doesnt react but just looks levelly back at him
they sit like this for about ten seconds looking at each other
were going to have a baby
alexei seems not to relax
he keeps his hand there
you heard what i said
ive been throwing up for weeks
alexei removes his hand
now he seems shocked
he lights a cigarette
were having a baby
what are we supposed to do with a baby
she comes to him and holds him
he is still absorbing the news
we see alexeis face over her shoulder behind her back unreadable
behind his back she rubs her wrists
some hours later its dark outside
john still tied to the bidet
the door opens a crack and somebody slips inside
we hear the toilet seat go down
as his eyes adjust he can dimly see nadia sitting on the toilet
she doesnt look at him
as she finishes she finally turns and holds his eye
she stands and slips out the door leaving him alone
cars crawl by on the road outside their tail lights stretching over the hill
the shot processes and fades into dawn and light
the early morning commuters now use the carriageway
bright sunlight pours through a high window
john is still on the toilet
he begins to try to struggle free
after a great deal of fierce deadpan shimmying and pulling he succeeds in loosening his bindings
freeing an arm he yanks the duct tape from his mouth and sits there panting
the first thing he does is take a pee then he drinks handfuls of water
he catches his reflection but cant look at himself
john collapses in an armchair rubbing his eyes
he looks shattered
the russians have gone
john in the shower just standing there letting the water hit him
john dries himself in silence
he pulls on his trousers sits down to do his socks
one sock on he walks to the smaller bedroom
he opens the door and peers inside
tied to the radiator gagged with duct tape is nadia
john looks down at her
she looks away as her eyes fill with tears
he sits on the bed facing her
they stay like that for a long moment before he reaches over and starts untying her knots
he peels the tape off her mouth
suddenly he slaps her across the face
her head hits the radiator
nadia gasps hard from the shock of the blow
without warning she slaps his face equally hard
this starts a long silent fight kicking hitting biting a real struggle
its intensity is almost sexual but has the edge of real violence
they end up on opposite sides of the room both panting hurt and beaten
in english great
youve split my fuckin lip
john lies there on the floor panting and he hears the english words
exhausted john stands wipes his mouth and rushes her anew
nadia dodges out the way and cuffs him painfully on the ear
the whole fight starts again and ends only when neither has the strength to go on
nadia staggers into the bathroom where she shuts the door and begins to sob uncontrollably
john lies on the bed listening to her cry
the mid morning traffic flows by on the dual carriageway
nadia and john sit in silence in the half empty diner
nadia has a cut lip and a graze on her chin
john has a thousand yard stare and a lesion over his left cheekbone
the waitress comes over
what can i get you
ill have an espresso with a small pastry a croissant or something
we only do a croissant with the continental breakfast
just get me a coffee
and for you sir
john doesnt answer
hell have a coffee
the waitress leaves them
nadia lights a cigarette and they sit in tense silence the pain of betrayal and recent violence thick in the air
you cant smoke in here
nadia ignores him
john bellows the diner falls silent people stare
she takes a last drag and crushes the butt on the floor
a waitress comes over and puts down two coffees
i dont expect you to understand
it seems as if john has no intention of replying
he sips his coffee and puts it down
he begins speaking very calmly
oh i dont know
in my job as deputy assistant of new business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals
this took a lot of understanding and sympathy to try to work out solutions to their problems
but you see im not in that line of work anymore
nowadays im a bank robber
you dont understand anything
i think that about covers it
i think i have grasped the part about you being dumped though
thats got to hurt i imagine
thats got to smart a bit
i mean strictly in my observers capacity it seemed you two were getting on pretty fucking famously
he sips his coffee
unless this is part of the routine
you get tied up stick around distract me they both bust in and steal my cup of coffee
its makes it easier
i dont want to know
it makes it faster
if i dont speak to the men they fall faster
its pretty obvious why
thats a relief
its nice to know im a regular guy
so what are you going to do
im going to drink my coffee
then were going to the police station
where there will be lawyers loss of job house humiliation gutter press and probably prison
they dont blame you
when a bank employee does this they understand
you get your life back
anyway i bet you hated that bank
even so i always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me
why else would you send off for me
if you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute
well as it turns out i did
she slaps his face
he slaps hers back
the waitress comes over
she pours for john
she smiles and leaves them
john watches her walk away
john i need your help
this really tickles john
he has to put his coffee down
you must think
im the biggest pillock
in the world
no i dont
in the world
i know you just want to punish me i do
i want to very badly
so youre just going to be vindictive in every sense
if at all possible
you cant hurt me more than im hurt already
well nadia it its all the same to you id like to give it a bash
my name isnt nadia
john stares back at her
john drags her by the arm across the car park towards the rover
john drags her out of the rover
she wrestles her arm free and walks up the steps on her own with some dignity
john follows her
they sit side by side in the waiting room not talking
nadia looks resigned to her fate
john is tight jawed unyielding
they wait as the the duty sergeant deals with a woman whos lost her hat
quietly to john wheres the restroom
im going to be sick
no youre not
im going to be sick
overlapping no youre not
how dumb do you think i am
nadia stands and addresses the duty sergeant
wheres the restroom
the what love
down there on the left
she heads off
john springs up
he seizes her arm as casually as possible
john frog marches nadia down the corridor to the ladies
she wrestles her arm free again and disappears inside
john lurks outside
he seems certain shes got one leg out the window right now
he cant bear it any longer
he looks both ways and nips inside
standing in the ladies john hears nadia in a cubicle throwing up
he hears the toilet flush
nadia comes out
he looks at her
nadia looks at the floor
john walks out of the toilet and stands against the wall of the corridor
he looks both ways
after a few seconds nadia appears in the corridor
they stand there
john isnt looking at her
a policeman appears from round the corner and walks towards them
he stops and addresses john
can i help you
john looks at the policeman then at nadia
the seconds pass
can i help you
john is still looking at nadia he closes his eyes
john walks back to the rover nadia behind
they reach the car
nadia looks at john over the roof of the car
what are you doing
john looks sick
he speaks very quietly
get in the car
he gets inside
nadia is left standing there
she gets in too
john driving with nadia in the passenger seat
she is looking across at him
he is taking no notice
plenty of women have babies in prison
john ignores her
tersely you dont have to do this
i can look after myself
flatly have you got your passport
have you got your passport
they drive along
weve got to get off this motor way
from above we watch the car turn off the motorway around a roundabout and into a country b road
john is turning the pages in his road atlas
he is trying to drive and map read at the same time
nadia is looking out of the window
soon a big tear rolls down her cheek
she starts to cry
john glances up from his map but ignores it
but she keeps crying
he tosses the map in the back pulls the car to the side of the road and switches off the engine
as nadia cries john gazes impassively out of the window
this goes on for almost a minute until nadia pulls herself together when without looking across john restarts the engine and pulls away
johns car pulling off a b road into a slip road into a garage
stern faced john fills the car up with petrol
he eyes the closed circuit
give me some money
i dont have any money
john stops squeezing petrol
i said i dont have any
john stares at nadia
he eyes the cctv
give me your sunglasses
nadia passes them and john puts them on trying to look casual
he gives the pump a couple more squirts hangs it up nonchalantly sidles up to his door
in one move he opens it dives in turns the key in the ignition
the rover coughs
he tries it again
it howls barks and sneezes
the attendant comes out onto the forecourt and starts approaching the yellow rover
miraculously it roars throatily to life he floors it and the rover tears away from the station and off down the road we see john at the wheel of his
rover sunglasses on wind in his hair fleeing from the scene of the crime
nadia watches him in the late sunshine but john is too busy making a getaway to notice
johns car shimmering as it comes over the brow of a remote country lane surrounded by fields and rolling hills
nadia puts a cigarette in her mouth and pops the dashboard lighter
john takes the cigarette and throws it out the window followed by the lighter
nadia just gazes out of the window
so uh alexei which i know isnt his name
i dont want to talk about him
its none of your business
must be disappointing though
must come as a hell of a shock
nadia ignores him
look if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is
if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you then yes he does
overlapping bigger of course
of course he does
but you know so what
its his baby i take it
she doesnt answer
not the kids type then is he
not that broody
you must be pretty miffed
he will come back
he left me my passport and ticket
its pretty clear he wants to see me again
i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too
but you tend to tie them up
he looks across
nadia gives nothing back
nadia is just looking at him
you started it
she is just looking at him
i dont want to talk about it
im not listening
you dont want to talk about it
okay we wont talk about it
nadia looks out the window
well pretend it never happened
whats it like having to fuck men you hate
i dont hate you
you have had sex with people you dont like havent you
to make money
what are you saying
and who says what is wrong
and that would be morals
that would be ones own moral sense of decency
whats a moral orgasm john
tell me how it feels exactly
you just detach sex from everything
whereas wet n wild is an emotional journey
tied and tethered
its pretty moving huh
like anna karenina
i didnt go rooting around in your private stuff
john remembers he did
nadia looks across knowingly
usually its the first thing they do
do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine youre with him or what
what does that mean
theres nothing wrong in liking sex john
i dont like sex
i dont think ill be having sex ever again
well its just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman or alone for that matter makes me want to die
so now you hate all women
i think its my safest bet dont you
i think you will recover okay
i think you got what you paid for
john looks across
i got what i paid for
you didnt mind too much
quietly it wasnt what i wanted
so what did you want
i think we understand each other no
quietly you dont understand me
you dont understand you either
john turns to her
its no big thing
you are the same as most men
you are a man so you are a savage
not a monster but half animal
you put on a tie and you go to the bank but really you are a beast
but also you are from woman so you have a soul
half beast half soul
but you hide your beast in the bottom of the wardrobe
its not so healthy
its fucked you up no
john stops the car
she sits there
get out you are throwing me out
she collects her bag from the back seat her cigarettes gathers up her belongings clicks open the door and gets out leaving the shot
john sits there staring ahead
we hear her voice offscreen
you prefer your women mute
john turns the key in the ignition
the engine bellows and screams
he tries again
the engine shrieks and wails like a soul in torment
a terrible mournful grinding noise
john tries to start it
it lets out a whimper a crying a few juddering moving sobs and dies
john sits in his dead car
he shakes his head
he rubs his face
he sits there
the two of them on a verge ten feet apart
john stares into the distance
nadia studies the map
its another twenty miles
its going dark
she gets her holdall from inside the car and stuffs the map inside
nadia scans the horizon with her binoculars
john watches her
you werent even on the plane
nadia lowers her binoculars and looks at john
john watches the passengers stream out of the arrivals gate
a woman is greeted and spun around
across the airport nadia lowers her binoculars
we pull back to see she is standing next to alexei
they say goodbye in russian
even though we dont see subtitles its a telling exchange
she kisses him and he watches her leave him and walk across the floor
alexei watches nadia approach john and see him shake her hand
they walk away together
alexei dressed in a suit stands outside johns house looking up
nadia is in the window her lipstick smeared
they gaze at each other
in a clearing john watches nadia carry a pile of sticks to a fire she is building
she lights it with her gun cigarette lighter and teases the flames to life
john and nadia sit by the fire
she sits wrapped up to her neck in a blanket
you know in russia theres no work for women
its a different world
interrupting on different you dont have to say anything overlapping on say what
i wasnt saying
overlapping on saying please theres no
i wasnt saying anything
pause so how old were you when you met him
you dont know him
he was very kind and strong
hes a smashing bloke
the rest of the world john its not all like st
thank christ for that
you are pretty naive if you think it is
im pretty naive
look at you
you have to do all this and what have you got to show for it
i dont have nothing
well what have you got
i have my baby
they sit there in the lapping firelight
do you know if its a boy or a girl
have you had any before
are you scared
maybe a little
a fox cries out in the night
i think its a fox
it cries out again
she gets out her binoculars
it sounds close
she looks through them and searches the brush
john watches nadia with her binoculars
he looks suddenly very sad
i cant see anything
its too dark
she puts them back in her bag
john watches her
he sees her wrist again
she lights a cigarette and blows the smoke into the air
what happened between you and the blonde
the girl with small eyes
the one in your cupboard
its none of your business
she didnt have small eyes
did she leave you
its nothing to be ashamed of
who did she leave you for
your best friend
did she leave you for a woman john
i didnt mean to hurt you
i dont know why i said that
shes not dead at all
nadia looks at john
i dont know why i said it
nadia starts to laugh
long and loud
we have never seen her laugh before
she is not dead
laugh it up
she starts to cough
she gets on her hands and knees and coughs like fury
you should stop smoking
you smoke like a fucking lab dog
im trying to quit
ive got news for you
its not working
i smoke more these days
i smoke more when im unhappy
nobodys that unhappy
maybe i want to die
dont you want me to die
i dont want anyone to die
except for small eyes
except for small eyes
she laughs again
so why did it end
it looks as if hes going to tell the whole story
in the end he shrugs
i dont know
what was her name
whats your name
the fox cries out again
its definitely a fox
now im scared
they listen to the fox crying in the night
you know you can come under the blanket
the scene from birds eye view
john lies back and stares at the stars
nadia curls up on the other side of the fire and hugs herself
we push down closer and closer until we are on johns face
the theme returns
the cricket boys from johns close stand in a line in the middle of the street bathed in flashing blue light
we pan round and end on johns house
it is surrounded with police
police cars police vans plastic police tape police line
johns neighbours press against the tape as officers come and go
inside the house is full of police ransacking his possessions and dusting fingerprints
a policeman is standing reading the english russian dictionary
we push on upstairs and along the landing to the spare room
an officer dumps a pile of porno magazines and videos on the bed
he then spots the belts tied to the bedstead and points them out to a detective
they exchange a knowing grin
a photographer steps up and snaps the paraphernalia in a blinding flash
the birthday cake is there half eaten
a policewoman puts it in a baggy
we pan across the bed across the magazines and underwear in plastic bags down below the bed where we find the photograph of nadia with the binoculars
the young girl smiles hopefully out at us from the past
a woodpigeon coos
john wakes up next to the dead fire
nadia is gone
john slides down a rocky slope
he scans the forest but theres no one around
he hurries through high bracken then stops suddenly by a large oak
in a pool in a stream below nadia is washing herself
she has her back to us
john watches her for a moment before his eyes avert and his head bows
a shimmering sun
a giant combine harvester cuts a wide swathe through a field of high corn
as it passes we find john and nadia coming towards us through the heat haze
they arent speaking and both look tired
as they pass we crane up out of the corn to catch an enormous jumbo jet just above us coming into land
we pan round to see half a mile away the massive airport beyond
they walk towards it two tiny figures
an attendant pushes a train of trolleys past
businessmen talk into mobile phones
ive got an hour
can i buy you a coffee
i think i better just go
theres just a touch of regret in this goodbye
these are for you
she hands him the binoculars case
because it was a lie
no it wasnt
he takes them
john nods and turns
nadia watches him walk away
on the other side of the airport john stands in front of the exit to the taxi ranks
hes got nowhere to go
passengers swirl around him
he looks at the binocular in his hands
he removes the binoculars and looks at them
suddenly he stops
in the case is a folded note marked john
john holds it in his hands slowly deliberately he screws it up and drops it in the case like a bin
through the binoculars
passengers criss cross but we find nadia sitting alone waiting for her call
john lowers the binoculars and gazes across the airport
he raises them for one last look
nadia glimpsed through the crowd
we spy someone standing about twenty feet behind her
it is alexei
we watch alexei approach her
she looks up and is completely thrown
yuri stands about ten feet away in shades
john lowers the binoculars horrified
he looks again
nadia pulls her arm away
alexei crouches down in front of her and puts a hand on her knee coaxing her
alexei takes her by the arm and leads her away
john hurries out of the exit to catch the trio leaving a different exit fifty yards away where they get into a taxi
john runs across a car park and over a low fence
he chases down a slip road as the taxi rounds the corner behind us
he takes cover behind a van as they drive past and away
john runs across a grass verge and another car park
he sees the taxi rounding the corner and head down the road in front of him
john runs as fast as he can up this road but the taxi is getting away
eventually he gives up and he drives away
at the roundabout it turns round and starts coming back up the road
john hides behind a car and watches the taxi pull up outside a small hotel about fifty yards away
he watches the trio head into the hotel
john skirts around the edge of the hotel
he peers in through one of the windows
its the foyer
he heads around the back
at the back of the hotel he looks through another couple of windows
suddenly he drops like hes been shot and sits on the grass
warily he looks again
alexei stands smoking in the middle of the room
nadia is sitting in a chair crying
alexei kneels again and appeals to her
nadia is resisting and yells back but something alexei says seems to melt her resolve
he holds her face and kisses it
she turns her face
he tries again and this time she accepts the kiss
slowly she kisses him back
john stares through the window at the scene
in the room yuri pops his head round the door and says something to alexei
alexei says hes coming
he kisses nadia again and leaves
nadia is alone
she looks very sad and confused
she moves towards the window and stares out into the blackness
johns face at the window
almost cheek to cheek with nadia
inside the room looking out
it is pitch black
john watches nadia walk over to the dresser and search the drawers
she goes over to the bed and looks under the pillow
there she finds what she is looking for
alexeis hunting knife
she hears alexei coming and stands hard against the window
the huge knife behind her back
he is four inches from the knife
john ducks down panting swallowing hard
at once he springs up and skirts the building again
he finds a window to the next suite
he tries to force it open
suddenly yuris face appears in the window cupped by his hands peering out into the blackness
john drops down holds his breath
john scrambles back to the previous window
with real effort he presses it open
he pulls himself up and drops inside
nadia still stands by the window one hand behind her back
alexei sits on the bed
the scene is subtitled
i love you
i dont need to tell you that
nadia looks at the floor
i wouldnt leave my child would i
you know that
i was confused
john opens the bathroom door a crack
he is at the opposite end of a corridor from the bedroom
he can hear alexeis voice
breathing hard he tiptoes out and stands in the corridor his back pressed hard against the wall
he takes one step down the hall
the floor creaks loudly
it wasnt easy for me
you know what im like
i needed to know what i wanted
now i know
john takes another step down the hallway
there by the door are the two guitar cases full of money
next to them is nadias bag
crouching john opens the bag and searches inside
he finds what he is looking for the silver cigarette lighter pistol
we hear the russian lovers voices next door
john is absolutely terrified breathing hard and shaking holding the little gun
you still love me
of course you do
yuri wont be here for a while
come on babe
he takes his shirt off nadia glances up with horror she sees john in the doorway
alexei turns to see john stand by the door holding a little silver gun
what are you doing here
john and nadia look at each other
what the fuck is he doing here
he looks at the little gun
thats that cigarette lighter i gave you isnt it
john takes a step back
alexei walks calmly towards john and throws a punch
it catches john right on the chin and he hits the wall and goes down very fast
alexei turns round to see nadia holding the knife
he is dumbstruck
what are you doing
to john what are you doing here
alexei kicks john in the ribs
in russian stop it
he looks at nadia the girl he came back for angrily pointing the knife at him
he suddenly looks completely punctured
john has struggled up again and stands behind him
they are both looking at nadia
youre with this creep now
youve actually fallen for this prick
no i havent
alexei looks dumbstruck
he laughs emptily babe its me
i wont let you get away
nadia stares back at him
the seconds pass
she speaks in a whisper
ill kill you if you try
in the impasse john picks up a lamp and hurls it at alexeis head
it is going to hit him but reaches the length of its cord and stops six inches short
in the confusion
alexei grabs nadias wrist and forces her to the ground
he grabs the knife just as john brains him with one of the guitars
it emits a fruity final chord
whistling yuri comes out of his suite knocks briskly on the door of alexeis and enters
we walk with him down the hallway into the bedroom to find alexei heartbroken tied and bound to a desk chair
yuri murmurs something in russian
fuck a duck
nadia stands at the window and stares at her reflection or past it into the blackness
get their passports
john finishes tying up yuri and removes his passport from his jacket
behind nadia another plane arcs up into the night sky
he takes alexeis passport from his pocket but alexei is only watching nadia
dont do this
she carefully places tape across his mouth
almost as if having second thoughts she bends down to kiss his cheek
the kiss suddenly makes alexeis eyes widen in pain
as she stands her lips are bloody
shes bitten him on the cheek
a single streak of blood runs from the gash
to john get your money
john collects the cases and they head for the door
nadia stops to look back at alexei
a final look
the front of the terminal
taxis pull up and idle at a rank bringing travelers to their flights
the automatic doors slide back and forth
last call for aeroflot flight to moscow
proceed immediately to gate
john carries the guitar cases full of money
nadia just has her small camouflaged hold all
they walk quickly together in silence and come to a stop at the departure lounge gate
are you okay
what will you do now
she looks at him
they stand around
she takes the last cigarette from a pack
you can probably buy them on the flight
this will be my last one
you didnt deserve me john buckingham
you prefer your women
she seems about to say something more when the tannoy interrupts
gate closing for flight to moscow
please have your tickets ready
she leans forward and kisses him
as they kiss john puts a guitar case in her hand
nadia looks down at the case
its not mine
its not mine either
its what you came back for
john frowns and looks a little embarrassed
she speaks to him in russian and we see the subtitles
in russian youre a big surprise you know
yeah you see when i said i didnt speak russian i wasnt actually just making it up
she leans forwards and whispers in his ear
john looks at her
he looks to the four corners of the airport
and back at her
im not asking you to marry me
its more like a date
its a long way to go for a date
tell me about it
she speaks softly in russian
we see the subtitle all that matters is to try
in russian we can only try
john repeats the phrase in russian
what does it mean
maybe you will find out
nadia kneels and opens the guitar case
she stealthily removes about five hundred
ill wait for you here
john runs across the airport to the ticket desk
he joins a queue of about three people
he works his way to the front
is the flight full
im sorry sir
i believe the flight is closed
is it full
please could you check
nadia stands alone holding her unlit cigarette thinking
she looks at the two guitar cases at her feet
she looks across at john anxiously drumming on the ticket sales counter
what is she thinking
close shot on the photo of yuri in his passport
the aeroflot desk official holds the passport and studies at john
with his four day beard there is a resemblance but its far from perfect
you have excellent english
how do you want to pay
john collects his ticket turns and heads back to where he left nadia with the guitar cases
he suddenly stops
he looks all around
people swirl about
shes nowhere to be seen
john hangs his head
he turns and walks away
john sits at a cafe table and watches the people come and go
he looks strangely calm resigned
close up johns fingers uncrumple the note from the binoculars case
he smooths it on the table then opens it
inside is written a short phrase in russian kam kapsi schta
john looks at the note
he folds it closed and surveys the airport for an exit
through the crowd fifty feet away getting a light off two policeman its her
nadia blows out smoke and speaks to the policeman
john watches her
suddenly she turns and points straight at john
the policeman look straight at him
as they head towards him nadia picks up the cases and walks away
john sits frozen as the police approach
excuse me sir
he takes john by the arm
come with us now
he doesnt speak english
hes epileptic or something
can he walk
can you walk
the policeman help john to the front of the gate where he is shown to the front of the queue
the policeman explains to the airline staff
we see that nadia is one behind in the queue
the police turn and walk away
john pushes his passport and ticket under the perspex window
he glances at nadia then looks at the young airport official the blood beating in his ears
for a few interminable seconds the officials eyes burn into john
john turns to nadia and holds her gaze
the subtitle appears youve saved me
nadia looks down at the floor
close shot the passport is snapped shut and pushed back through
john walks without looking back
he turns to see nadia is behind him
as they round the corner she hands him a case
they walk side by side without speaking
both look forward straight faced as it both are thinking about what it is that they are actually doing
john looks back once but he keeps walking
he looks across at nadia but she doesnt look back
they stop opposite the automatic boarding doors
nadia turns to john
my names sophia
mines still john
the doors slide open
john and sophia walk through and disappear
the roar of jet engines
with a deafening roar an aeroflot boeing lifts slowly from the runway and climbs up into the night sky where it becomes a distant star
a distant aeroplane in a cobalt blue sky through binoculars
the young girl from the very first scene lowers the binoculars and lets them hang around her neck
she squints up at the sun
a voice calls her
the girl looks round
she runs past us and we follow to see a couple sitting on the grass having a picnic
the girl hurries towards them and we realise the couple are john and sophia the girl her child
she sits down with them
