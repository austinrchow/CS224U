written by lee hall richard curtis
the bucolic magnificence of the devon countryside
we fly low over the high thick hedges untouched for hundreds of years
the thick verdant countryside in all its splendor ancient woodlands fields of corn and finally a paddock in a typical devonshire dale
we come to rest beside three farmers standing over a pregnant mare
the mare is in distress she is about to give birth
the farmers calm the mare and tend to her gently with assurance and authority
we pull back to see albert a fifteen year old farm boy watching the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate
come on easy girl
the men hold the mare firmly but clearly this is a difficult birth
this is a stubborn one huh
there we go
whos a clever girl
moments later the summers sun glints off the wet sticky hide of the foal joey red hide four white socks and a distinctive white cross on its forehead
soon the creature is attempting its first clumsy steps
it is both awesome and comical to see the new born creature struggle to his feet but eventually he succeeds
title war horse we follow joeys progress over the course of his first year
his initial fearfulness his connection with his mother the intimacy of their relationship
as joey gets strong they run together frolicking gayly in the last dregs of summer
albert looking on
joey notices him at the fence and they share a moment of connection
spring flowers are beginning to sprout by the hedgerows
our boy albert runs into the field
he takes an apple from his pocket he holds it out tentatively
joey approaches albert with suspicion
albert gently encourages him
his mother paws the ground and neighs at joey
he turns and runs over the field at her beck and call
albert tosses the apple to himself ruefully watches in awe as joey races away with his mother
he is a magnificent one year old
his distinctive red coat gleaming now it is clear that he is half thoroughbred
he runs quickly around the field enjoying his own power and strength
later the three farmers open the gate and come into the field
both joey and his mother instinctively canter over to the two men expecting food
the three men gently greet the horses and pet them then we see one man has a noose made of a rope
he slips it round mums neck
she pulls back joey is shaken and bewildered but before he knows whats happening the second farmer is trying to get a similar rope around his neck
joey balks and pushes the farmer aside distressed to see his mother tethered
the farmer grabs joey again and struggles with him enlisting the help of the second farmer
with some effort they get the rope around his neck and calm him down
easy does it
easy does it
come on steady does it
unused to being tethered joey pulls at the rope but the farmers are solid and firm
they gently lead joey and his mother across the field to the gate and out into the road
the whole road becomes overtaken by a flock of sheep on their way to the market
in the distance we hear the bustle of market day
the farmers lead joey and his mother through the chaos of the market and into an auction pen
they find themselves amongst a hoard of pigs sheep and cows
joey is agog at all of these creatures and all this life he had no idea existed
the farmers lead the horses into a stall to await the auction
joey is bewildered by all the noise buttressed against a couple of mules and a cow
he is uncomfortable in this tight space
an auction worker holds a clipboard out for the lead farmer
put your mark here
two men approach the pen
get the colt
one man grabs joey and pulls him out of the pen
suddenly there is a look of horror on his face
his terrified mother realises they are being separated
joey panics and desperately tries to get back to his mother he rises up throwing the man who is leading him aside
joey is out of control
the man regains control of joey
he pulls joey away from his mother who lets out a heart rending cry paws the ground and crashes her foreleg against the fence
joey remains disoriented in the midst of the market day chaos
the auction ring is full of people of all shapes and sizes
there is a sense of celebration and busyness about market day
we concentrate on two men ted narracott dad in his forties clearly both the cares of the world and alcohol have worn him down before his time and si easton
his more solid friend both working farmers
just behind si is his year old son andrew
ted has a drink in his hand
they all look at joey bridling against the men who are trying to hold him
now thats a beauty
forget it ted
hes half thoroughbred and not got a days work in him
points to a plow horse next to now there
theres your ticket
in contrast to joey the solid and bulky plow horse stands like a rock
but dad remains fixated on joey
but look at him si
look at that creature
indeed joey is magnificent his power clearly emerging because of his upset
dont be daft
you need something solid to plow a field
fixed on joey yeah but hes something else that one
the auctioneer announces the start of the auction
alright gentlemen settle down settle down horses on my right men with money in their pockets on my left its the perfect combination
is fred goddard here
fred shouts his reply from the crowd
good more money than sense
bugger off you tight bastard youve been coming here for years never bought so much as a pork scratching
the crowd are loving all this
dad notices a figure across the ring lyons clearly a man of money
you can see something light up in dads eyes a combination of dislike and alcohol
joey is led into the auction pen
okay first up today a gorgeous young horse prettiest thing ive seen since my wife on our wedding day
lets get going shall we
who wants this wonderful creature
but no one bids
one guinea one guinea one guinea
i thought you needed a plow horse mister narracott
any advance on one guinea
any advance on one guinea
joey is still trying to get back to his mother
a voice from the crowd pipes up two guineas
ted narracott its completely the wrong animal
lyons whispers to his son david next to him
david eyes joey skeptically
si easton im not gonna let that bastard see me off
oh for the love of
joey is straining to get to his mother the men are pulling him back
greedy sod thinks he can just buy anybody
stop it hes your landlord you cant be picking fights with him
lyons looks over
there is now tension in the crowd as they sense a battle royal for the horse
he smirks at dad
you havent got the money
lets go home lets have a pint
eleven guineas sir from as good a man as any in this town
they all look at lyons in his suit and bowler hat
do i hear twelve guineas
thats top price for a workin animal
save it for the shire
there are big days and there are small days
which will it be
do i hear any advance on eleven guineas
all eyes are on lyons and his son david is smartly dressed
just let him go dad i dont care for him hes too
lyons isnt listening to david hes looking hard at ted
shall we say twenty five
the crowd gasps
this is clearly personal
well hes got you there
nice try ted
you were great mr n
gave him a run for his money
but when he looks at ted teds eyes are locked into the eyes of his rival
he stares hard at lyons
who simply smiles raises an eyebrow tips his hat and walks away
it dawns on dad that hes won the auction
he breaks into a sweat
going going gone to mister ted narracott
he bangs his gavel
its a done deal
what have you done ted
what have you done
dad doesnt acknowledge si
moments later ted stands staring at joey who looks back
ted holds his reins numbly accepts his receipt from the auction man in a kind of daze
suddenly lyons appears at dads shoulder
quite a beast there
but what you gonna do with him on a working farm
i hope you got the rent ted
ill be around for it when it comes due
dad does not acknowledge lyons
lyons smiles and walks away with son david and his cronies
si shakes his head at dad
youre a fool ted
and our rosiell never forgive you
narracott kneels in her garden digging up some carrots when she sees ted returning
dad walks down the hedged lane as the sun sets pulling joey with him his bad leg always moving slightly to the side
narracott looks in horror and bewilderment at joey and then at dad
she is a good looking intelligent woman but clearly her life is always hard
what have you done
dad stands shamefaced as albert the boy we have already met runs out of the house to join them
thats mooneys colt
you were supposed to buy a plow horse
you bought him
whatd you pay for him
albert is totally taken by the horse
how much ted narracott
i wont tell you a lie though i would love to
she is stunned
she looks at ted and he just nods
hes not worth ten
are you out of your mind
what about the rent
hes a strong one rosie
look at the way he holds his head
how the hell are we gonna pull anything with that
ted you have to take him back
you have to take him back right now now
you have to get down on your knees and beg for our money back
joey bridles at the raised voices but albert takes the rope and tries to calm him
no please dont take him back
suddenly we see dads dejection
he is a man lost
we cant take him back till hes broken in
and how are you gonna train a horse with that leg
ill train him
no you stay out of this albie
you dont know nothing about horses
please let me
i can do it
we have to keep him
weve no choice
youve got one month to break him in or im taking him back myself
she turns to the house but then
how did you get to thirty what other fool bid you up that high
it was lyons
narracott turns back towards the house then stops dazed speaking almost to herself
were gonna lose everything
after all weve been through were gonna lose it all
she turns back to the others the weight of the mistake heavy on their shoulders but albert quickly steps forward
dont worry mum ill raise him and ill raise him good
well you better
go on get started
see if a child can undo what your fool of a fathers done to this family of ours
narracott storms into the house
albert immediately goes to stroke joey but the nervous horse draws back uncomfortably
dad leads him off drunk and bewildered across the yard to the barn
albert loads some oats into a bucket and approaches joey in the field
lets make a start then
as albert approaches joey nervously runs in circles then stops on a dime looking at albert suspiciously
very tasty that is
its beef and gravy to us
albert squats down
he shows the food
joey catches the scent on the air but still hesitates and shies away
this time albert takes a new tact almost turning his body fully away from joey but keeping the bucket extended
albert slowly backs towards joey speaking gently all the while
i bet youre missing your mother
look at you
first time without your mum
first time away from home
but youre not alone are you
cos im ere
feeling safer joey moves toward the bucket of oats and starts to eat
albert reaches out his hand and touches joey
and with a slight start the horse relaxes into alberts hand feeling safe with the boy
albert stares at the distinctive white cross on joeys forehead
im gonna call you joey
and im albert
its alright youre mine now
albert strokes joeys forehead
joey lifts his head and the two stare at each other in close proximity
dad with a hangover hobbles off to work the fields
as he reaches the gate harold the goose snaps at his heels
dad dismisses him with a stare and heads for the stables
the training episode albert walks joey around the yard on the rope
it all seems to be going well
mum looks on
albert is clearly proud of his progress
alberts friend andrew easton sits on a rock with an apple in hand to watch the training
albert sets joey in a spot and tells him to wait
i want you to stay there joey
thats it youve got it
of course when albert walks away joey follows
a game of grandmas footsteps ensues as albert patiently places joey then walks away
hey look at him albie
hes playing grandmas footsteps
albert patiently leads joey back to his starting position
right come on joey
back you go
back you go
youre all right
youve gotta stay there understand
albert walks away again
youve got it
finally joey stays put
andrew smiles impressed
now call him
come now joey
albert whistles like an owl
joey stands completely still
you can come now joey
he whistles again
joey remains still
dont think he fancies your owls
albert walks back to joey frustrated
no i read it in a story
its how the indians used to summon their horses
he gently strokes joeys nose
now joey when i whistle youve gotta come understand
my dad had a dog who stayed when you called him
he used to run up behind you when you werent looking and uh
hes not a dog
hes just puzzling it through
albert runs further away than before and whistles
after a moment joey trots over to him
andrew smiles broadly
look at you
with the basis established albert begins to train joey to react to the owl whistle without his prompting
its not all easy going sometimes albert makes progress sometimes not
quick montage mrs
narracott fills a bucket at the pump then promptly spills it when joey trots past her in response to an owl whistle
she calls off frustrated
dad heads out to the fields with a rake on his shoulder
theres an owl call and joey trots past him in the background
dad sees albert welcome joey by the haystacks stroking his nose affectionately
dad walks on his expression inscrutable
joey trots up a path pursuing another owl call
after several more calls he still cant spot albert until he cranes his neck up and sees albert sitting in a nearby tree
lyons is there with his son david and his unlikable cronies
he holds a meager handful of cash
dad and mum look chastened
the mood is sombre
theres only fifteen here
the rest will come
you know by rights i could take this farm back today dont you
and im a great believer in my rights
it will come
if you drank less beer and bought fewer horses you might be able to look your landlord in the eye narracott
lyons begins loading up his ledger into his bag
i said ill pay you
we got to plant the bottom field
bottom fields rock hard
only stones down there
no were going to plow it
just give me til the autumn
ill pay every penny i owe you
how you going to plow it
not with that fancy animal of yours
hell do it
youll not get that one in a harness let alone pulling a plow
even drunk on a tuesday night you know that
and i cant wait for the money theres a war coming
dad stands up from his chair resolute
i promise you that field will be plowed
well plant it with turnips
and the money will be yours when harvest comes
narracott interjects desperate
lyons takes his time
he looks at them both ted and rosie almost beaten
very well if that fancy plows that field ill give you till october to set things straight
lyons heads for the door but albert stands in his way
what if he doesnt
ill take the horse on the day he fails
and ill take your fathers farm and give it to working men who can hold their pints and hold their heads high in decent company
lyons tries to move past but albert grabs his arm
sir you cant do that
now now now lad
what are you bladdered as well
ted narracott i got you down in my book
albert knows he has to back down
lyons walks past him and leaves with david and his cronies
harold the goose attacks lyons and his men
they quickly pile into his car and drive off
ted stands in the kitchen immobile with upset
dad throws open the stable door jerks the harness from the wall throws open joeys stall and starts to lunge at the horse
albert runs in to try to stop him
you cant harness him
hes got to be collared
dad starts to grapple with joey desperately flailing in an attempt to get the harness onto joey
joey is completely confused and frightened
no you cant
look youre scaring him dad
youre scaring him
he cant take a plow
joey tries to push dad out of the way dad frustrated by this hits joey hard with the harness
hes got to plow
he wont be able to do it hes too young hes not even been backed yet
joey rears up and kicks dad
who falls to the ground
albert grabs joeys bridle
joey wrestles with albert
its alright boy
dad is mad with anger and frustration and in pain
he staggers to his feet and leaves
albert calms joey down
narracott returns the harness to its hook
i knew this would happen soon as i laid eyes on him
but then she notices dad has returned
he has a gun
hes worth nothing to me
if he wont take the collar hes not worth a damn thing
he grabs the rifle but dad shoves him away
dad raises the rifle but albert wrestles for it again
furious with frustration dad throws albert to the ground and takes aim at the horse
narracott quickly pulls the gun aside
you shoot that horse we have nothing
dad whips the gun back towards joey to find albert standing between them right in front of the guns barrel
for a second we think albert will be inadvertently shot
dad pauses his finger just in time
albert gently holds the barrel of the gun
you were right what you said dad
hell do it you told lyons hell plow that field
and he will
hell show you
well show you
well get it done
dad looks at him frozen
narracott eases the gun away from him let go
and hands it to albert telling him go back to the house
as albert leaves ted takes out his flask
but rosie takes it from him gently
he doesnt resist
some days are best forgotten
today aint one of them
they exit the stable together leaving joey in his stall
albert walks towards the stables enters
and talks to joey as he prepares the harness
how are you today joey
i dont know much about life boy but i do know that there are big days and there are small days
and most days are small days and well they dont matter much to anyone but this well this is a big one
this is our big day
well its cold out there
so im going to take this off he takes off his coat well if its tough for you it should be tough for me too
he is left in just a loose fitting white shirt
now im gonna teach you how to plow and youre gonna learn
is that understood
and then we can be together which is how i believe things are meant to be
joey instinctively balks but albert is stern with him
here we go
here we go
as he approaches joey with the harness harold the goose enters the stable to watch
albert approaches gently and slowly puts the harness over his own neck and shoulders to demonstrate easy easy
look at me joey
youve just gotta put your nose through
it is a moment between them
the horse looks albert in the eye then yields
albert comforts him and show there is nothing to fear
finally he gets the harness in place
youve got it
youve got it
harold honks his approval
albert leads joey out across the yard through the broken gate
it is a grey day as they walk across the plowed fields towards the huge lower field
they come to a rusty primitive plow left in the grass
albert looks around the field it is overgrown it seems to go on forever even if joey was a plow horse this would be a heavy task
si easton and andrew stroll up the road to watch
too large too rocky matted with grass roots
even a sturdy plow horsed never manage it alone
yet he will i say
youd swear hed sprout wings and fly if albert had told you so
smiling at his son its a fine thing loyal to your mate
even if he is a bit barmy
a team of two might manage given a month and good weather
theyre interrupted by the honk of a horn as lyons and david pull up in a car
lyons and david get out
their driver remains inside
ted too squeamish to watch is he
course hes watching
si nods in the direction of the house
albert steadies joey and starts to tie on the heavy plow
it just seems too big and bulky for joeys sleek frame
albert sets joey right and fixes the plow
lyons david si and andrew walk towards dad who looks on anxiously from a nearby hedgerow
lyons gestures at david to stay back and walks over to ted alone
he stands beside him and begins to talk gently
well youve raised him up a true narracott ted picture of his father he is not a dollop of ordinary sense but that thick stubbornness thatll lead him to insist
on the impossible
down in the field albert continues to prep the plow
wasnt a farmer in devon didnt admire you myself among em leaving your brothers that fine farm and setting yourself at this stoney patch of unpromising ground
youve fettle enough for twenty men but with a gimpy leg and the drinking for the pain isnt it that you drink
yeah none of us could have anticipated an ending better than this
makes me question the wisdom of the charity that urged me to rent you this place not only looking at you me old pal but that pretty little wife of
yours thought you were a spark she did
ted hasnt acknowledged lyons for a second hes never taken his eyes off albert
he simply stands and walks away as and now your sons sinking into the selfsame bog thats swallowing you
albert has been meticulously preparing everything positioning joey checking the tethers digging the rusty plow in the earth
he takes his position behind the plow throwing the rear leather harness over his own neck
see joey i got the collar too
albert gently snaps the reins
joey doesnt move confused by the whole affair
come on boy
walk on joey
come on boy walk on
youd be better off startin at the top of the hill and goin down
gravitys the only friend youre gonna have today young lad
walk on joey
come on joey walk on
walk on boy
at the house mrs
narracott opens an upstairs window to look on anxiously
ted standing alone by the fence only looks at albert
come on walk on
itll take the whip to move him
just as ted is saying this albert as if hearing his father takes a breath and then abruptly produces a whip
joeys ears prick up
albert grimly determined snaps the whip at joey
joey panics and bolts
the plow spins to its side pulls albert off his feet
joey drags them all the way to the top of the hill right by the farmhouse
lyons yelling starts laughing and cant stop
youve reached the top of the hill
off you go again boy
youll make even better time comin down
he continues past dad laughing
narracott looks on from the house
he glances back at her
her face is full of angry concern for their son
townsfolk begin arriving climbing the hill to the lower field
ted looks down ashamed
narracott looks back at albert mortified bruised setting the plow right again
narracott moves away from the window takes a seat and picks up her knitting
later albert has made no progress
joey is moving but only in a useless circle
now walk on
more townsfolk clamor to the fence
andrew calls out
albie were all with ya
albert tries to encourage him forward but joey still isnt pulling sufficiently
the plow skips uselessly over the surface stones
look look look
the plow hasnt even cut yet
as albert struggles with the plow he sees dad walking up the hill behind the spectators
he doesnt even turn to his son
joey strains as albert pushes with all his might
we sense the strain on the horse and the inappropriateness of the task
but joey perseveres
the plow limps along
do you know i believe we can do it joey
i knew when i first saw you that youd be the best of us
thats why he bought you
he knows youve all the courage he never had
i knew when i first saw you that youd be the one whod save us
the plow skips and albert falls
joeys legs buckle and he goes to his knees
albert rushes to his side
lyons calls from the crowd as rain starts to fall
youve got no chance lad
hell not turn over half an acre
give it up now
youve done well
youve tried hard
youre more of a man than your father
albert examines the collar he sees it is ripping into joeys flesh
he grabs his shirt tears a piece off it tenderly folds it and puts it between joeys shoulder and the collar
come on now mr
lyons thats a bit rough isnt it
well hell destroy that horse
the crowds beginning to disperse
one of lyons cronies holds his umbrella as he returns to his car
he passes ted
ill be over thursday
give you a day to close it up
narracott emerges from the house and heads to the fence holding her knitting in the rain ignoring the leaving crowds
a sympathetic neighbor hands her
im sorry rosie
lyons passes behind her almost speaks but then thinks better of it
as the rain intensifies albert digs his toe into the wet soil and notices how it has softened
suddenly something flashes through alberts mind
he leaps into action runs through the rain to shout at joey
youve got to do it joey
you dont know so im gonna have to do the knowing for you when the rest of our lives depend on this
so get set to pull and pull straight
and pull hard
he races back to the plow and sets himself
joey pulls firmly and finally the inertia is broken the rain has softened the earth
walk on joey
good boy joey
finally the plow bites deep into the soil
walk on joey
at the fence mrs
narracott looks on in amazement
albert notices a large rock in their path
andrew sees it too
go around it
joey whoa whoa whoa
youll break the blade
albert hauls back on the reins but joey throws his flanks forward straining and lurching until the plow blade splits the rock completely in half and now the plow moves
more easily through the wet ground
the ground yields
soon albert and joey are making great progress
the wet earth slipping open beneath them
andrew is loving it speaks in wonder
will you look at you
narracott looks very happy a smile breaking slowly across her face
the crowd begins to return
lyons notices and looks out from his car sees the plow digging through the field
annoyed at the progress alberts making he gets out of his car and walks over to mrs
with great disdain he id not let a child of mine slip in the mud alongside a plow blade
he could lose a foot
narracott brandishes her knitting needles backing him up
youll likelier lose an eye mr
lyons if you carry on prating at me how to manage my son
or my plow or my horse or my field or my farm
dad sits nearby watching this exchange with silent approval
lyons stares at her gape mouthed as she turns her attention back to albert
come on albie
push on through
the rain becomes torrential
lyons turns towards the car gestures frustrated to his driver who runs forward with the umbrella to shield his boss from the rain
david remains on the running board watching albert plowing
the plow speeds through the earth
the boy and the horse are working as one
it is a moment of triumph
get it done albie
get it done
we pull back to see they have made only the smallest dent in the enormous field
as lyons car passes dad steps forward takes in the scene and almost smiles
the rain has abated
albert soaked to the skin sits next to joey
they are both covered in mud
andrew followed by si easton charges through the gate up to albert
they are lifting albert up between them laughing si easton planting a kiss on alberts muddy cheek andrew tousling his filthy hair when mrs
narracott arrives with ted
she helps si and andrew lift albert and slings her sons arm over her shoulder glowing with pride crying overjoyed
oh my pair of fools
my mighty fools
as the others help albert up ted tends to joey
he looks over to his son and after a moment removes his cap and slightly bows his head
the others stagger away supporting albert and ted pats the horse and gently begins to unbuckle the harness
albert washes joey and tends the wounds and sores on his body
rosie is putting antiseptic on alberts wrists and shoulders
joey bristles but is soothed by alberts care
youre as battered and bloodied as he is
and wheres dad
still in the bottom field
stumbling about i suppose
its not the drink albert that makes him stumble
he drinks mum
well so might you if youd been where hes been seen what hes seen
well he dont talk to me about it
he dont talk about it because he cant
there arent words for some things
rosie stalks over to a pile of broken equipment in a corner of the stables
she rummages until she finds a waterstained brown paper parcel tied with yarn
she brushes away some mouse turds
the miceve been at it
they sit together on a step
as she begins to untie the yarn a change comes over her her irritated determination gives way to sadness
albert comes to her and kneels beside her as she gently opens the paper
inside theres a red and tan pennant knotted and fringed at both ends
its his campaign pennant
he were sergeant seventh battalion imperial yeomanry
then with great care she unfolds the sash to reveal two silver medals
the first with the profile of victoria hangs from a red blue and orange ribbon
and that is the queens south africa medal
every man who fought in the boer war got one of those
she holds up the other medal hanging from a red and black ribbon
thats the distinguished conduct medal
she hands albert the distinguished conduct medal
he takes it astonished
well it aint mine dear
he got that after the fighting at transvaal
after hed been hurt and hed saved some other lads and well
i dont know what else he wont tell me either
but the first day he got home he just
tossed them out
first day he could walk he threw em straight in the dustbin and wouldnt hear a word i said not to
albert nods looking at the medal and campaign pennant
she takes the medal back puts it in the sash and begins to wrap it again
see what you done today you and joey youre chuffed up now and so you should be my splendid boy
its good to be proud when you done something good
but what he done in africa whatever it was he takes no pride in it
hard as it surely was and however much pain its cost him he refuses to be proud of killing i suppose
she returns the things in the footlocker closes it
id be proud
if id gone off to war
if id gone and saved my mates and well whether or not you think youd do the same thing as him
think how brave he is for refusing to be proud
she heads back to albert pennant in hand
oh your dad makes mistakes
and he drinks to forget the mistakes that hes made but he never gave up and he does that for us
and today you showed the world its all been worth it
as she leaves she drapes the pennant over alberts shoulder
you keep looking after joey and hell always be looking after you
albert looks again at the pennant
sergeant seventh battalion imperial yeomanry
amazed to joey you see this joey
its been through an entire war
albert holds the pennant in wonder
im not stealing it
ill give it back to him someday
dad hobbling across the furrows alone planting the field by hand
albert and joey are now in a meadow
they trot past the field he plowed now packed with a strong and sturdy crop which ted tends to
the sun is breaking through and joey starts to run across the field and up a small incline
as both joey and albert gain confidence they pick up speed
albert pushes joey on they are going faster and faster albert yells with the exhilaration of it all
joey races flat out across the countryside
albert hanging on for dear life
albert and joey pull up beside a sleek red car
its lyons car being driven by david lyons every inch the expensively tailored rural gentry
um im the only boy that drives in the village
no one else drives but me
thats right and this is my dads car
youre lucky that youre in it
im not normally allowed to drive it cause its so albert urges joey to go faster till theyre neck and neck beside the car racing it
david lyons looks to see albert and joey running alongside his car
he feigns disinterest
albert glances at david but hes much more interested in the very pretty young woman seated next to david her hands trying to control her hair flying in the wind
forgetting himself momentarily albert stares at her dazzled
the woman turns to david is he a friend of yours
she smiles at albert encouraging him
david lyons annoyed pushes the accelerator down and the car edges ahead of joey
but not for long
the sound of the acceleration and alberts eagerness to impress the young woman make joey go faster and again he moves out ahead of the car
the young woman grins at albert
up ahead albert sees that the wall alongside of which hes been racing turns the corner presenting him and joey with an obstacle
albert encourages joey to go faster
come on boy lets show her how to fly
they head right for the wall but at the very last moment joey balks and comes to a dead standstill sending albert sailing over the wall
back in the car the girl gasps and covers her mouth concerned
david says nothing but allows himself a small smile
on the other side of the wall albert stands a bit battered but unfazed
youre clearly not gonna be a jumper
thunder starts to rumble ominously in the background
albert and joey return driving sheep before them
angry storm clouds stretch to the horizon
as albert leads joey to the stable lighting blasts across an angry sky
the rain is falling in torrents
another crack of thunder and a piece of wood in the roof gives way water gushes in dad rushes to support the roof as the wind forces a window open
at that moment the door suddenly swings open with the violence of the storm smashing against the wall dad and rosie turn and there is harold the goose who scuttles
in without his usual arrogance and hides himself in a corner
shoo shoo shoo
the thunder cracks again and
albert and dad walk across the field
narracott digs through the mess
the entire crop is flat ruined by the storms
the ground squelches beneath their feet
the whole field is a write off
we can try planting something else or we could hire ourselves out to uncle bob
dad doesnt answer
he shakes his head and limps away
how else we gonna pay mr
ted doesnt turn around
narracott makes some coffee
ted sits alone on a chair
what we gonna do
i used to believe that god gave each man his fair portion of bad luck
i dont feel that any more
ive had more than my share
youll stop loving me rose
and i wont blame you when you do
well i might hate you more but ill never love you less
then somewhere in the distance an unfamiliar sound
a motorbike rumbles along the lane at huge speed creating a cloud of dust as it goes
the noise of the motorbike is drawing attention from all over the valley
it can be heard fields away and everyone is drawn to this completely unheard of sound
the motorbike whizzes through the village
heads turn in astonishment
the bike comes to a stop in the market place
the rider takes off his goggles
men of the village start to flock around the machine with great curiosity
we are at war with germany
england is at war with germany
shock and amazement
the rider takes off his goggles theyre going to ring the bells at six oclock and then never ring them again until the war is over
everyone across england knows that their lives are about to change
dawn rises over the farm
albert races to the stables excited with the campaign pennant
as albert enters the stables he calls out look smart joey lad its the tavistock fair
albert opens the doors and stops dead
he looks at the empty stables
albert runs out
he rushes into the kitchen
his mother stares out the window
she has been crying
what has he done with him
she says nothing but her face gives everything away
albert in a panic turns and runs out into the lane
narracott tears up again
the market square is full of military men
the union jack is flying up the flagpole
a group of girls has gathered to check out the army boys
eager young men crowd a table staffed by recruiting officers last name first
first name middle name last
captain nicholls is in the square inspecting joey knowledgably
he is a handsome attractive modest upper class man
dad stands beside him
he checks joeys teeth his feet and finally looks him straight in the eye
take my word for it finest horse in the parish
goes like a racer strong decent very fine
captain nicholls has immediately connected with joey and puts him at his ease
sam perkins a tough sergeant is physically inspecting joey
no curbs no splints good feet and teeth
hes as sound as a bell sir
and how much are you charging sir for this strong decent and very fine animal
ill give you twenty and not a penny more
twenty is no good to me captain
thirty five and hes yours
i dont even know how he rides
oh he rides
youll be astonished
i promise you that
his hearts in his throat fighting back finest horse in all of devon
finest horse i ever seen
albert bursts into the square just in time to see nicholls and dad shake hands
their business concluded
albert races towards joey
ted grabs him
albert fights to get free
he looks at his father in anger and betrayal
you cant hes mine
i trained him
albert is hysterical
you cant have him
hes my horse sir
im afraid its too late lad
ive just paid thirty guineas for him
please ill get you money
i will ill get you money
ill work for it
ill work for it
he wont obey anyone else
he wont be any good in the war neither
he shies at every sound
albert snaps to attention
well if joeys going im going too
whats your name lad
and how old are you albert
is that the truth
but but i look nineteen and im bigger than most nineteen year olds sir
and im strong sir
im not afraid of anything
i dont doubt your qualifications albert but the law is very clear about the proper age for soldiering and your fathers done what he had to do
you know that
thirty guineas isnt nearly enough to purchase a horse as fine as your joey i know that
but its all ive got
will you lease him to me albert to be my own mount
he removes his cap i promise you man to man that ill look after him as closely as youve done ill respect him and all the care that youve taken
and if i can ill return him to your care
albert looks at him
although nicholls speaks with authority he has a kindness which albert recognizes
now say goodbye
albert kisses joey
its all right boy
but at that moment sam perkins pulls joey away all right turn it in eh
hes a horse not a dog
now on your way
nicholls walks away into the crowd
the sergeant pulls joey but joey does not want to be separated from albert
his reaction is implacable reminiscent to the separation from his mother
perkins leads joey away
they disappear into the crowd and rosie is suddenly there
ted senses her silent judgment
do you want to lose the farm rose
its the way you did it
but were at war
arent we just
she looks at albert
the recruits march through town under pennants and the strains of a familiar song the jolly plowboy it is a song they all know which means a lot to them
full of soul a song of harvest or a celtic hymn something relating specifically to the lives they have led together
everyone of every age everyone in the village knows this song it is theirs
nicholls passes in his car and we see those they are leaving behind cheering a whole generation of young men is marching off to war
one girlfriend rushes up to kiss her leaving boyfriend
albert watches joey then remembers the campaign pennant dangling from his pocket
he runs up to joey joey
and tucks the pennant into joeys halter
here now ive told you sling your hook
but nicholls intervenes from his car
let him be perkins
this isnt the end
this isnt the end my brother
i albert narracott solemnly swear we will be together again
wherever you are i will find you
and i will bring you home
and then they are past him leaving him behind
as perkins leads joey across a stone bridge albert watches from the bank of the stream
joey balks one last time
steady now come on
walk on now come on
then perkins leads him away leaving albert behind
the very last recruits leave the village leaving the debris of this armys visit strewn on the square
like the debris of a party you are already beginning to regret
joey is handed off to a groom
joey is amazed by the scale of the building
each horse has a large stall and is being tended to assiduously
joey looks around at the hundreds of men and horses around him and panics
whoa whoa whoa
he bucks throwing the groom to the ground and gallops away
but perkins cuts him off grabs his halter and jerks him back to attention
whoa whoa whoa joey
stop muckin about you hear
yer in the army now son
he pushes him into his stall next to major stewarts horse a magnificent black stallion topthorn
good boy good boy
easy easy back up
joey rears up in his stall
joey meet topthorn
topthorn this is joey
sort out whos in charge between the two of you you hear
if you want to fight you get it over with cause once were over there youre gonna need everything youve got for fritz
this is the first time that joey has had to deal with another horse since his mother the beginning of one of the most important relationships in his life
i dont want to sour him
nicholls passes his gloves and crop to his bat boy who is there to assist him
therell be nothing gentle about the war sir
and therell be nothing gentle about this one either
i understand that sergeant but i want him fit and shining
hes my horse
nicholls is joined by his friend lieutenant charlie waverly
he is sweet and friendly upper class but completely benign
scares the living daylights out of me
glad hes on our side
theyre both joined by a tall confident officer major jamie stewart
he sizes up joey
not bad at all
still not a patch on my topthorn
i wouldnt be so sure
i think hes got potential
hes certainly got the bit between his teeth
i actually think my blenheim is faster than the pair of them
he suddenly turns from the joking into the efficient senior officer he is
all right gentlemen listen here
everything tells us the same story from waterloo to omdurman from picketts charge to the battle of mars la tours the first attack can and should be the decisive one
no excuses no mistakes every horse groomed and fit for presentation
i want a full practice charge tomorrow
the whole regiment is gathered
everybody is in their ceremonial uniform
it all has the feeling of the changing of the guard rather than anything related to a real battle
the day is hot the plains are quiet and beautiful the gathering is huge there is a real sense of pride and anticipation
captain nicholls resplendent in full uniform rides joey out over the vast expanse of the plain
both nicholls and joey are dressed up like something from the last century out of the boer war even the charge of the light brigade
nicholls is proud and confident
they gather before hundreds of men and horses all lined up to be inspected
charlie joins them looking pretty good on blenheim
finally nicholls and charlie reach stewart and topthorn waiting in position
thought you two had bottled out
nicholls looks at his friend tolerantly
all right then lets see what you two jokers are made of shall we
this is what quiet confidence looks like
ill wait for you two at the duke of york
nicholls and stewart and charlie prepare themselves for the charge
joey and topthorn size up to one another
over to you captain nicholls
topthorn bristles at joey
everyone is highly charged
the competition between stewart and nicholls seems to have been absorbed between the horses
topthorn and joey square up for the practice charge like two athletes before a race
nicholls raises his sword
it glints in the summer air
it seems to hang there forever
every man follows suit
topthorn and joey glance at each other ready to charge
every sword is pointed directly ahead at arms length
a roar goes up from the men and a deafening pounding of hooves breaks the silence
the huge line of horses start running straight ahead of them
joey and topthorn run off at top speed
dust and earth rise up behind them
bugles the deafening thunder of hooves
it is exhilarating
we see the scale of the operation we enjoy the speed and the splendor of the mass of men and horses
the soldiers shout in glee and excitement
each man pushes his horse to out run those around him nicholls and stewart seem locked in mortal combat
nicholls smiles at stewart confidently
topthorn starts to pull away ahead of all the other horses in the line
nicholls pushes joey on
topthorn seems too strong joey will never catch them
nicholls is determined not to be beaten
come on joey
i know youve got it
come on boy
he pushes joey on
joey digs in and finds hidden strength and speed
he starts to catch up with topthorn and draws along side
nicholls and stewart exchange tense looks
come on boy
stewart is amazed and pushes topthorn harder
now both riders are going at their top speed
they are neck and neck they fight for every inch of advantage every fibre of their being invested in the race
nicholls pushes joey on and joey pulls away
joey inches forward till he is almost a length ahead of topthorn
the effort is enormous
nicholls looks back at stewart very happy
stewarts frustration shows
he knows he is beaten
then suddenly they race over the line
nicholls spears a ring decorated with a blue ribbon and pulls joey to a halt
they have crossed the enemy line
nicholls is ecstatic
topthorn comes to joeys side
nicholls laughs grinning
nice of you to turn up
the horses are nose to nose snorting we sense the heat the exertion
topthorn and joey are brought together by the effort
we sense topthorns newly minted respect for joey
and joey is no soft touch he slightly holds his head up in victory letting topthorn know that he knows he won
the other horses come charging in
there is a real sense of achievement and congratulation amongst the regiment
hes got speed
ill give him that
but has he got stamina
he has everything
the two men enjoy the moment of rivalry and the exhilaration of it all
the two horses face to face rub against each other for the first time
a bond has been formed
a phonograph plays roses of picardy
the walls are decorated with etchings of famous battles and a large map of western europe that depicts how the english troops are crossing the channel to confront the germans
nicholls is writing a letter though actually at this moment he is making a little pencil drawing of joey to enclose with it
what are you up to
im writing a letter
with a picture in it
its to the boy who owned joey
i want to show him how wonderful hes looking
before we take him away across the channel to face a million germans guns
start tomorrow travelling with the dragoon guards and the royals
transport detachment theyll need to be at the docks at am
check all kit
battle orders no polishing buttons helmet buckles stirrup irons let em all go dull
i want nothing to flash in the sun and give us away
as stewart leaves he passes charlie
he casually acknowledges him
charlie checks his new cap in the mirror
what do you think of the cap
he shows the bright red lining to nicholls
i quite like it
im not sure its going to make a lot of difference to the germans
oh i dont know about that
think about it youre a boche just working out which of two chaps to shoot and you thought good lord one of them really is wearing a very stylish cap
you might shoot the other one instead
or alternatively think i fancy that cap and kill you first of all
charlie removes the cap
hadnt thought of that
nicholls returns to his sketch
three hundred horses and their charges in a slow march in the middle of the most pristine french countryside
nicholls and stewart and charlie ride on a smooth road past a series of posts screened with cloth
theyre silhouetted against the setting sun
the regiment are tense and nervous as they gingerly make their way along the country road
topthorn and joey sense the grim change of atmosphere
they are in woodland above a plain stretching for miles
a small table has been taken out for stewart and his officers
sergeant major singh a turbaned indian with a magnificent moustache dressed in ceremonial garb explains the lines of battle on a map
that is our target the german th division at the moment bivouacked three miles to the east of the menin road
we have been watching them and they have pitched tents for the night and lit cooking fires
knock them out and we could slide in behind the german lines and come at them from the south at geluveld
about six hundred
twice our size
in regiments of horse and men the advantage is ours
and we have surprise on our side
but the sooner we move the better we have no assurance theyll still be there tomorrow morning
our officers just have a second to take in the news
the day has suddenly arrived
the day they have worked for for so long
so today it is
charlie tell the men
well charge through them and secure the ground behind
the grass to the left is taller than we are its perfect cover
excellent work sergeant major
time spent on reconnaissance is rarely wasted
as stewart departs thank you singh
nicholls catches up to stewart concerned
they have no idea were coming
not having scruples are you jim
i understand the surprise is everything
but if it must be done lets do it quickly
nicholls notices charlie nervously attending his horse
are you alright charlie
never been better
literally never better
we worry for him he is afraid
stewart rides through the lines astride topthorn
prepare to mount
as the cry is echoed throughout the regiment nicholls accepts joey from an attending soldier
thank you standley
my bonny boy
youre all right arent you joey
nicholls takes the red campaign pennant from his pocket and threads it through joeys reins
minutes later stewart addresses the men
it is an honour to ride beside you
make the kaiser rue the day he dared to cross swords with us
let every man make himself his king his country and his fallen comrades proud
honor the king
in unison shout fear god
honor the king
cut to an elegant field of tall grass waving in the gentle breeze
then suddenly three hundred men seem to rise out of it
they are in fact our soldiers mounting their horses but the horses are invisible in the height of the grass
stewart gives a signal
we see the intense anticipation on his face
he takes out his sabre
the men draw their sabres in silence
the birds chirping oblivious
then nicholls just turns to his two friends and almost whispers
good luck my friends
he pats joeys side
forward to walk
the regiment begins moving through the field
forward to canter
the men start to float over the grass swept along by their invisible horses until
suddenly they emerge from the tall grass the immense power of the galloping horses silence explodes into a violent crashing of hooves
the noise is immense swords are flying in the air
hundreds of horses racing towards the german encampment
on the german side two soldiers wake to the sound of hoofbeats
they pull their tent flap aside to find the invincible charge coming towards them
the germans are totally unprepared
we see them scramble back towards tents rush towards their guns one man pulling up his trousers rushes for cover
one german drops some dirty dishes into a wash pot screaming kavallerie
topthorn and joey race each other like a rerun of their practice on salisbury plain
the swords and uniforms glint in the sun the german troops look terrified some run in panic others prepare to stand their ground
the british head in for the kill the men scream battle cries with sheer exhilaration
we see the horses at close quarters running with all their might
nicholls and stewart yell as they approach the enemy
the surprise attack is a huge success
the first row of unprepared germans are falling
the regiment sweeps through the encampment cutting down soldiers and driving the rest in a panicked retreat to the tree line
but then we see in the shadows of the forest behind the a machine gun
no a line of machine guns at least twenty guns sandbagged apart the logical new modern defence of a garrison
in an instant the fleeing germans have manned the guns
all now firing
the noise of the blast of bullets drowns out everything else
a score of men and horses are suddenly on the ground it happens almost so quickly joey and topthorn dont realize anythings wrong and find themselves racing straight towards the
the bullets keep coming now suddenly half of the regiment are on the ground
horse after horse races past the guns into the woods
all of them now riderless
nicholls watches helplessly as one of the barrels swings towards him
his face goes slack as he realizes he is about to die
a moment later joey runs on we pan up to see he is running on riderless he has not realized that nicholls is gone
the bullets whizz around his head but he still runs directly ahead
we would always know him by the red pennant nicholls tied on his saddle
joey is now running through the german lines
no one bothers to attack him as the germans concentrate their efforts on the cavalry behind him
the line of machine guns fire as one decimating the horses and their riders
joey leaps and dances nimbly through the german ranks but suddenly rears up in the confusion surrounded by germans
near him surviving english officers are hauled from their horses
stewart wheels back around on topthorn sabre in hand
but he too is quickly surrounded by several germans with their rifles trained on him
a furious german officer storms over speaks perfect english what
did you think that a garrison on open ground would go undefended
look at yourself
who do you think you are
stewart looks at the officer at the guns that surround him and throws down his sabre stabbing it into the ground
the germans take stewart from topthorn
around them the fields are littered with dead soldiers and horses
topthorn appears disoriented and frightened
suddenly he rears up and bolts from his new german handler galloping over to joey
the horses briefly nuzzle but both rear up again as they are separated and led past a young german soldier gunther
he zeroes in on them the finest horses
a slightly more junior officer approaches the outraged senior officer
what do we do with the horses
if theyre injured shoot them
and the others sir
the others you round up and take to base camp they will pull guns
youll never get fancy horses like these to pull guns
then shoot them also
gunther the young private now standing behind them interjects
sir perhaps we could use some of them with the ambulances to get the injured men off the field
will they take the harness
id like to try sir
the officers move away thats enough talk about horses
cut on gunther is now with joey and topthorn
near a wooden ambulance which is like a giant wagon to carry humans
he is with michael a very young soldier his brother possibly as young as
gunther lifts a heavy pulling harness and tries to get topthorn into it
it wont work theyre cavalry lets try
you wont get the harness on
come on michael
topthorn balks violently
easy now easy now englishman
whoa whoa whoa
easy now easy
its hopeless we cant help them
and suddenly joey moves up and presents himself with his strange self assurance and self sacrifice
and instinct for survival
he sniffs the harness and places his head through it which helps to calm topthorn enough that gunther can slip the collar onto the big black horse
gunther turns to joey impressed
well well look at you
whoever taught you this has just saved your life
gunther spots the red ribbon in joeys saddle removes it folds it and places it in his pocket
later gunther and michael are returning from the battlefield with topthorn and joey pulling an ambulance with british and german wounded
amongst the wounded we see a hand gripping a battered silk lined hat
it is waverly wounded but alive
si easton lets himself in through the gate
ted pulls up turnips from their three acre crop
rosie just across a furrow is also engaged in the harvest
its hard work
si holds a parcel
hello the farm
looking up wiping her hello si easton
albert passes carrying a crate laden with turnips but pulls up short when he hears i was at the post office and while i was there mrs
allen said a parcel had come for albert from the from the from over there and i thought i could go up that way in the morning
and here it is
well whod be sending me a parcel over there
well open it and see
albert opens the parcel and pulls out a leather sketchbook
its a sketchbook
gasp of realization thats captain nicholls sketchbook
thats a picture of joey
its a picture of joey
well i never
and theres a letter
well go on then go on
dear albert narracott
captain nicholls who died
captain nicholls who died in action today left you this
yours sergeant sam perkins
si easton drops his head guiltily
rosie catches this
you werent to know it was bad news
he was riding joey when he died
you dont know that he was riding him
in action it says
everybody falls silent
albert goes to the fence and looks down at the sketches of joey
rosie looks at her son her heart breaking for him
dad returns to the harvest without a word
albert looks off to the horizon and over there
close a step stool
michael mounts the stool next to joey and topthorn removes their harnesses and carries them across the road
michael slips and falls into the mud
gunther dashes over and pulls him up just before a military convoy pulls into the camp running over the tack
the base camp officer appears on a motorbike
we move forward to the frontline tonight
full marching orders
as the soldiers hop to their orders the officer turns to schroeder
both michael and gunther turn to him
but its gunther the officer wants to talk to
no not you you
gunther picks up the dropped harnesses as he approaches
im keeping you here
you are best with the horses and we need to move the camp quickly if the enemy continue to push through from the west
theyre pushing through
we will move later when we find where the horses are needed most
perhaps i can keep my brother here with me hes also very good with horses
oh no no
we leave tonight
he walks away
gunther is stricken by the news but michael is excited
as he leads joey past his brother its all right gunther
gunther cant really speak
michael is just a boy
soldiers are lifting up their equipment gathering moving in the same direction
in a quiet tent a few last soldiers are packing
and there are gunther and michael packing together
you are not going
ill tell them you are only fourteen that youre a boy
father signed me in
he knew my age and so do they
the process of packing is their way of coping with the shock
gunther is folding one of michaels shirts
michael takes it back
mother obviously never taught you how to fold a shirt
of course she did
i just wasnt listening
but you need to listen now
i promised her i made her a solemn promise that you would be safe with me
with me michael
he leans close to michael talking in almost a whisper
theyll never make a head count
there are too many of us
you can stay here slip underneath the bed until they move out
michael carries on with his packing
gunther it will be fine
and when all the machines break down and they call up the horses ill see you at the front
well be together again
and now the case is packed
gunther heads to the tent opening
looking round the tent is now empty
the moment to leave has come
gunther pulls the red pennant from his pocket and follows michael out of the tent to where the soldiers are lining up in the road
im giving this to you
gunther ties the pennant to the back of michaels pack as he forms up
to keep you safe
michael smiles at him and begins to march
marching towards ypres on the western front
zwei drei vier
we settle on young michael in line he passes gunther
he remains eager
but it is goodbye
these soldiers moving into the darkness and towards death
gunther looks on tears in his eyes
the two horses are uneasy sensing tension
a few minutes later gunther grabs a saddle and throws it onto joeys back
back to the soldiers
suddenly we see the galloping legs of two horses
they whip past the back of the line of marching soldiers
its clear what is happening gunther is on topthorn and has hold of joey on a loose rope galloping beside him
gunther galloping along the line of soldiers spots what he is looking for a red pennant unfurled and flapping in the wind tied onto michaels pack
gunther speeds toward him
this was his plan all along
and in an instant he is beside him and without michael ever realizing he suddenly finds his arms and legs akimbo as he is yanked out of the line and
dragged along the ground desperately close to joeys pounding hooves
michael looks at the soldiers beside him he looks at the skyline of violence ahead
but before he can decide he feels his brothers arm pulling him upwards
and now the two of them are fully on topthorn
they leave a jumble of soldiers in their wake as the officers try to restore order
get back in line
michael now rides joey following gunther on topthorn
the brothers look at each other cant believe what they have done michael is following his brother swept along doesnt know if it is right
and michael and joey and gunther and topthorn charge on to freedom
they spot a lonely house and burst past a line with some drying clothes
as they ride they grab civilian shirts and jackets and trousers the clothes pegs pinging off and falling to the ground
and on they ride though all too soon day starts to break in the far distance
they see a very dilapidated windmill
they aim for it as the sun begins to seriously break over the horizon
they reach the windmill
it feels very unused
the machinery of the windmill creaks in the dawn
the brothers untether the horses careful now that it is light outside
did you bring food
michael fingers the pennant on joeys reins
will father be ashamed
he will pretend to be
maybe at first he will be
but in the end he will be glad
what about us
gunther looks at him but doesnt reply
as michael removes i was ready to go
i was proud to go
after a beat in a very i wanted to go
later they sit in silence waiting for sleep
the food in italy is good
what about the women
not as good as the food
theyve eaten too much of the food
you are too young for war
and youre too young for women
gunther laughingly pushes him over
i dont feel so young
go to sleep we have a big night of riding ahead
he jokingly strokes michaels cheek
michael swats him away but as he settles in the hay night night gunther
gunther and michael sleep
suddenly something awakens joey
he stirs and then rises
hear the sound of engines and see lights through the slats sweeping across joeys face
michael and gunther are stirring in their sleep as we hear a car and several motorcycles approaching
head lamps filter through the cracks in the windmill walls stabbing the brothers awake
in die windmuhle
the boys spring up speaking in terrified whispers
go go go
they race up a nearby ladder but michael stumbles against a table upsetting some gear
it clatters loudly
they cower as they hear boots tromping up the steps outside
then the windmill doors are thrown open pinning them in the bright headlights of the vehicles
as theyre marched out we see what they see a german car two motorcycles
six germans including the officer who was in charge of them
hes offering an excuse but a promise
the officer accepts this grimly nods
as the boys are taken away he lights a cigarette
through the turning arms of the windmill we glimpse the double execution
four rifles fire flashes of the soldiers shooting the bodies on the ground
complete stillness in the empty countryside
there are joey and topthorn still waiting
and then suddenly the doors of the windmill creak
the two horses turn immensely aware of the break in the silence
the door opens a little and we see reflected in joeys eye a very delicate beautiful thirteen year old country girl she stares at the horses
they stare straight back at her
and she walks straight out again closing the big door behind her
joey and topthorn settle for a moment
time transition joey and topthorn are in a slightly different place and the door opens again
it is the same little girl but this time she comes in carrying two buckets full of water
a small humble farmhouse and round it small fields planted with different fruit crops
we see an old man grandfather burdened with a basket of berries heading back towards the farmhouse
a sound causes him to look out across the farm far in the distance the storm of war is in the sky
he enters the kitchen which is rough but full of the paraphernalia of jam making jars sieves pectin sugar
emilie is at the sink washing berries
he heads towards the side board dumps the two bags and lifts the first handful of fruits on to the counter
she empties her clean berries into a bowl
notes the explosions outside
its closer today
the wind plays tricks with the noise its moving away from us
i can hear it grandpere and there is no wind
you shouldnt lie to me
there is no wind here
but over there a wind so strong it will lift you off the ground
you lie about everything
you say you arent worried but its clear you are
i know the war is approaching but you say oh its just a trick of the wind
he retrieves a bottle of medicine from the mantle
did i say that
you started lying when mama and papa went away
she pours a load of sugar into a bowl with the fruit
but you wont say so
do you think ill die if you tell me the truth
the truth is he feeds her a spoonful of the medicine
you should speak to your elders with respect
she sticks her wet finger in the sugar and sucks it to help with the taste of the medicine
if you tell me the truth about the war i will tell you the truth about the big horses ive been keeping in the windmill
standing putting his hands on his hips now who is the one telling lies
grandfather looks stunned as he paces in front of joey and topthorn who stand in the small courtyard outside the house
in the windmill
they were standing in the windmill waiting for don quixote
this is francois joey and this is claude topthorn
i named them after two boys who broke my heart last summer
they must belong to someone
horses like this dont just appear from a fairy tale
yes i know grandpere
they are not unicorns so i will be fair and wait one day
and if no one comes to get them by night time then they belong to me
look at me
you cannot ride
mother used to tell me how my bones would give way with the slightest bump or fall
so it is settled
she kisses his cheek good girl
but then calmly leads the horses back to the windmill
it will only be settled when i decide which one to ride first
but its over my dead body
at least i wont have long to wait
that is the end of the conversation as far as she is concerned
emilie is with the horses in the little stable at the end of the courtyard a bit away from the farm house she is feeding them out of a bucket
not very nice gruel
we see that she is hesitant with them that she has spent no time around horses
i was in love with a boy called francois who had your lovely eyes
unfortunately he was in love with a girl called marie who had your teeth
she fell for a boy called claude who broke my heart
and who i intend to marry one day
grandfather watches emilie from inside the house as he makes jam
eyes on me
outside emilie has fashioned two jumps
the big one for joey and a little demonstration obstacle for herself
she leads joey to a starting point about yards in front of some crates supporting a stick about four feet off the ground
the red pennant hangs from the stick
joey stands quietly as emilie hobbles to the big jump making a jumping gesture with her hand
today we learn to jump
did you know the french cleared one meter eighty five at the paris olympics to win the gold medal
today we will beat that record
emilie indicates the larger barrier
this is your jump
when i call you
be very brave and leap over it
she claps but joey doesnt move
leap over it
she turns to her demonstration jump and easily steps over her six inch high barrier
and now its your she turns to find joey already stepping over her mini jump stopping in front of her
hes only interested in the apple in her hand
she takes a bite herself
emilie returns joey to the starting line and runs back behind the big jump
from behind her back she produces three big carrots dripping soil
joeys ears perk and he takes off quickly but at the last moment veers right and passes between the two jumps
grandfather is watching through the window as he prepares his strawberry jams
he laughs and goes back to work
aware shes being watched she slings the carrots over her shoulder frustrated
joey slowly emerges from the barn with emilie out in front leading him with one hand
in the other hand she carries a small wooden step ladder
he doesnt think we can do it
but we will show him wont we
emilie unfolds the ladder beside joey and shakily starts climbing to the top of it
her voice shaking no need to be afraid
emilie looking down at how far off the ground you are
before she can swing her leg over joeys back youll kill yourself
emilie turns and there blocking the hurdle now standing hands on hips is grandfather
only if you get in my way to make me fall
oh please come off the ladd a sound from far down the road
emilie turns to look too
two trucks led by a german motorcycle are approaching the farm
find somewhere to hide them
and do it quickly
as emilie races off with the horses grandfather pushes over the jumps and jams the pennant into his pocket
the bikes arrive first just missing emilie as she leads the horses behind the house
the trucks arrive pull round one of the soldiers in the front jumps out and opens the back
the people of them all seeming to be poor french peasants mainly women move out of the truck
as they walk past they avoid the eye of the grandfather who approaches the soldiers
my name is bonnard this is my land
why are you here
food for the soldiers at the front
everyone must give their share
and suddenly we see what is going to happen the peasants spread out and move through the field with either bags or using the aprons they wear picking all the
fruits at just the moment all the work has brought forth fruit and the new years crop is ready
raspberries black currants gooseberries
in a few minutes everything he lives by will be gone
watching from his car and calmly smoking a cigar is brandt the officer in charge of the unit
cut to the fields the aprons and baskets are getting full
they move through the rows of fruit like a plague of locusts
back to the grandfather and out of the house comes emilie
they are taking everything
where are the horses
the sound of jars breaking draws grandfather and emilie into the kitchen where the germans continue to raid their other supplies
one german picks up waterbath canner inspecting it
what is it
leave it if you dont know what its for
a pot is a pot
well find some use for it
sir wheres the livestock
brandt sits quietly casually using his finger to scoop jam from an open jar
i make jam
we have no animals
but theres fresh hay in your barn
emilie enters overhearing
we use it to replace the mattress stuffings
where are her parents
the german nods and is about to take his leave putting the pot back where he found it when a clumping noise from somewhere in the house begins
what is that
it plays tricks in the attic
brandt licks his finger and tests there is no wind
an old house creaks
go close the shutters
emilie runs out of the room
the soldier picks up the medicine bottle
shes sickly no
if you or any of your friends harm her as old as i am i will kill you
the soldier looks shocked and then begins to laugh
he slaps the medicine flask into grandfathers chest
you know i was going to give you back your pot
but now im going to keep it
he slings the huge pot he had put back up on his shoulder and leaves the house with the other soldiers
we will be back in the new season
as the germans leave we cut to the upstairs bedroom where emilie lies curled up on the bed and there standing on either side of the bed are the two
they look huge in the tiny room
the sound of shells exploding
a huge bombardment somewhere in the deep distance
but much closer than before
the distant malicious giants of war growl
it is like a lightning storm on the horizon
the kitchen has been emptied
the war has finally come to them and we can see it on emilies face
tell me what happened to them
to my mother and father
grandfather doesnt respond
you said you would tell me how they died
on my birthday
and tomorrows my birthday
they died fighting didnt they
but when the soldiers she finally turns to face him
you do nothing
you are a coward arent you
it was your parents who were brave
i make jams
and youve never done a brave thing in your life
he eases himself into a chair and shrugs
maybe there are different ways to be brave
did you know the french have the best carrier pigeons
and this could be the difference in the war our messages getting through
i dont want to hear about the birds
they are released at the front and told to go home this is all they know
but to get there they must fly over a war
can you imagine such a thing
here you are flying over so much pain and terror and you know you can never look down
you have to look forward or youll never get home
i ask you what could be braver than that
emilie sheds a single tear
grandfather enters the barn strokes topthorns nose as he passes
he sweeps aside a rug from the barn floor to reveal a trap door
then he opens it
now from out of the trap door he lifts a big ungainly object covered in another rug
emilie comes down the stairs as grandfather waits proudly by the stove
she stops when she sees the object covered by the what is that
emilie moves toward the object that is covered
i hope you have not bought me a disgusting dress that i then have to wear like last year
it was disgusting
i looked like an ugly nun
then she stops herself and turns to grandfather with a parental rebuke
give me your hand
she takes it in hers grandpere we have no money
when the war is over then you can buy me jewels and carriages
the grandfather smiles and gives emily a hug
anything you say my sweet one
anything you say
you are of course the boss
its just an old thing i found dont worry yourself leave it ill put it back
he leaves the room
now emilie is alone and she cant help it when she brings her eyes back to the object covered by the rug
she looks back over her shoulder to make sure shes not being watched and then lifts one corner of the rug
her face explodes with a gorgeous smile
she pulls off the rug that is covering the big thing and
it is a gorgeous old saddle
she runs her hand along the saddle can hardly believe it
grandfather helps to swing emilie up and into the saddle
all at once the grandfathers charity evaporates
it was your mothers
i hid it so as not to encourage you
emilie i want you to ride very slowly very carefully
and promise me you wont go far of course
okay i promise
to the top of the hill and straight back again
emilie unties her hair and tosses the red pennant to grandfather releasing her hair to spill down her back and shoulder
she sets off on joey and quickly spurs him to a gallop
she rides past the windmill and then over the top of a nearby hill she speeds over it and out of sight
back to the hill a sudden change of mood
an empty shot
no movement no returning girl
cut again to the top of the hill then back to the grandfather very worried
topthorn suddenly rears up and charges off following sensing danger
grandfather starts to run in the direction of the hill
topthorn charging over the brow of the hill
the grandfather running out of breath
he hears an indistinct scream from emilie
he reaches the top of the hill comes over the brow and there is not the fallen body of emilie which he has been fearing but a brutal line of
german soldiers and motorbikes
it is like a line of indians in a western total alien fear
and there amongst them is emilie astride a panicked joey surrounded by soldiers
another one holds topthorn who bucks and rears but to no avail
grandfather starts down the hill towards his granddaughter
the germans are moving through the horses they have gathered
emilie unhorsed tries to get to joey who is being roughly led away by a german soldier
let go of me
grandfather grabs her
she is screaming
he tries to calm her down
joey is tied up as is topthorn
emilie is kicking and screaming but also desperately short of breath
she is my granddaughter
dont hurt her please
dont hurt her
a soldier roughly shoves emilie at him
emilie screams at him in tears
you dont need them
there are so many others
emilie is still sobbing
grandfather hugs her in horror that she is now struggling so hard for breath
please take the bigger one and leave the smaller one
you are breaking my granddaughters heart
the war has taken everything from everyone
what will happen to them
they will pull artillery until they francois
or until the war is over
it will never be over
you have your answer then
the motorbikes start up and drive off
the grandfather hugging tiny emilie as she coughs
the germans disappear up the lane leaving the old man and the child bereft in the bitter cold
two grooms trail brandt leading joey and topthorn toward a makeshift corral
heiglemann these are yours
they look strong should last a month or two
friedrich is an unprepossessing chubby man
he marvels at topthorn
you are beautiful
but then he looks to the other horses penned nearby haggard and weak
he turns to joey
its a pity they found you
he takes the leads of the pair of them
such a pity
in a strange way there are many humans joey meets but also just one the spirit of goodness and consideration for animals joined by little echoes throughout the film
and then they go over a ridge and we suddenly see the explanation of friedrichs comment
the road they can see below them is the main through road of the area and it is a scene of horse horror huge massive guns and cannons and artillery
being dragged by teams of horses that are in a terrible condition
for joey and topthorn this is a moment like when soldiers arrived to liberate the prisoners who had been kept in changi prison by the japanese during world war
they have never seen horses in this condition
you can see in their eyes the confusion
this is a whole different world where horses can turn into creatures that look like this
and it is also a vision of their future
this may be the moment the mighty topthorn begins to lose hope
for joey it is another level of knowledge another mighty thing he will fight through because he always fights through
friedrich leads joey and topthorn in the wake of the huge morser an elaborate ton monstrosity with a six inch bore
it takes a team of six horses to haul it with a dozen men pushing from behind
a soldier calls from the front of the heavy cannon pulled by a particularly wretched group of horses
lower down the hill friedrich waves down the rest of the column
at the front of the morser one of the lead horses collapses he will never get up again
brandt steps up pulls a revolver out of his pocket and shoots the horse dead
it has come to this
joey topthorn and all the other horses are spooked by the pistol shot
brandt shouts to friedrich from the road
heiglemann bring up another one
heiglemann bring up another horse
friedrich begins leading joey up the hill but no no
the big black one
friedrich hauls topthorn hesitantly while joey watches
as he reaches brandt hes a good horse sir
but if you move him up to the heavy gun he will be no use at all
prince is already losing condition
his leg sir
you have given them names
you should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose
his leg is not good enough sir
private you will do as you are told
hook him up
friedrich has no choice but as he starts to lead topthorn joey rears up and escapes his groom
he gallops up the hill to the gun offering himself up to save topthorn
it is his tale of two cities moment giving up his life to save his friend
he bucks and rears
friedrich turns to brandt
as you see sir this one is stronger
brandt takes up friedrich and joeys offer hook him up
as joey is hooked to the gun he looks back to friedrich who leads topthorn back down the hill
the convoy struggles up the hill
joey feels the dead weight of the gun
these are several tons of cast iron almost dwarfing the horses
together this grim circus struggles along the pot holed country road in the rain
joey leads the team up the incline
each step is an immense effort
the going over rough scree is very tough indeed
it is very difficult for joey to get a foothold on the loose ground but his experience in dartmoor comes into play and although he almost loses his balance several
times he stays upright and hauls the cannon fitzcarraldo like over the hill
we follow his progress step by step
friedrich watches anxiously
soldiers strain at the sides of the gun
one throws boards under the wheels to aid in traction
as they reach the top of the hill it almost seems the effort is too much the cannon always in danger of rolling back
joey finally staggers over the top it feels as though the tethers are going to snap with the strain but at last the cannon reaches the peak the crest of
soldiers scurry around the giant gun preparing it
take the horses away
friedrich observes with topthorn as a giant shell is carried to the guns breech
the men wrestle it into place back
and secure it
the barrel of the giant gun ratchets upward
the shell explodes from the barrel
and then from another
for the first time we see the big picture the line of assembled cannons of which they were just one tiny part
each gun recoils violently as they shoot their shells into oblivion as soon as one shell is fired another is loaded the noise is deafening the line seemingly endless an
obscene production line of death
this is what the horses have been feeding this massive merciless thing
smoke wafts from the guns as we see the explosions in the distance
the sound of the explosions takes us to explosions light the dirty faces of british boys in uniform one after the next
each light fading out before the next great blast illuminates another anonymous face then another and then another and then albert
hold on him for extra moments before he fades completely
with the barrage lifted the british soldiers that are huddled in a low sub trench are ordered back on the line
andrew easton is with albert and hes shaken and terrified
a far cry from the happy young boy we knew
a gruff sergeant sergeant martin walks the trench with a bucket and each soldier puts in their valuables and personal belongings
one a lighter some money etc
valuables in the bucket lads
if you live youll get them back
if you live youll get them back
albert and andrew move down the trench in a line of soldiers who are given ammo belts and grenades
albert gets his grenades and walks further along the trenches
we follow him in real time as he passes a bunch of soldiers who are kneeling in the ankle deep water a padre is giving them communion
the deafening noise of shelling all around
maybe its a drill albie
maybe its a drill like last time
we keep following alberts progress in real time further on there is a post box where they all put their final letters home in identical green envelopes
we see alberts letter addressed to ted and rose narracott in devon
he posts it in a battered metal post box
an officer approaches love letter
thats my business
it is david lyons son now in charge of this small group of men
still arrogant looking older than albert in his uniform and clearly enjoying his superior rank
i hear you and your mate were doing bird imitations again
you gonna write a letter to your horse
albert ignores him
andrew cant help but giggle
after you find your horse ive lost my needle in a haystack and i could use some help
david takes up a bucket and walks down the line of soldiers
anyone who comes back gets to share it out
albert follows david down the trench
remember that day me and joey raced you in your car
i remember you somersaulting through the air
who was that girl you were with
there was a girl
dont you remember
it was just some girl i suppose
i dont recall which one
i do remember you falling on your bum in a ditch
andrew laughs amiably
david points to him smirking
always entertaining narracott ill give you that
as david walks on andrew smiles at albert
you did that
you fell on your bum
albert leaves without answering
andrew keeps smiling until a large shell explodes nearby
troops surge towards their ladders as officers scream indistinct orders
now david leads his troop through the trenches to the front line where they stop lean against the enemy side wall nervously and wait each man in private contemplation
sergeant martin moves along the lines pushing men forward
lets go men get ready to go
get ready to move out
stay in position
david calls out from atop a trench ladder
hold your nerve boys
remember its not far to go
theres a way through
he moves down the line run fast keep your wits about you keep your eyes open and god and the king will keep an eye on you
company will fix bayonets
the echo of fix bayonets goes down the line and every man fixes the brutal shining bayonet to the end of his gun
then albert turns to andrew
you know what it reminds me of out there
that bloody impossible lower field the day me and joey plowed it
best day of my life that was and you were there
and this here is the worst day of my life about to begin and youre here cheering me on
us two always
he nods at david lyons who gives instructions to another soldier
once youre in no mans land go to the flanks
stay on the flanks
david turns to albert and andrew
come on boys come on
to the ladder
stick close to the gentry thats our ticket yeah
we have the pluck but they have the luck
they both smile
and then the fear takes over again
andrew particularly feels as though he is on the very edge now
david urges them forward
you too narracott
and you too
andrew and albert pass by the bucket
they throw some valuables in
but a moment later albert goes back to the bucket and pulls something out a worn piece of paper he unfolds it it is the little sketch that captain nicholls
drew of joey the night before they left for france
he slips it inside his shirt next to his heart
come on on your ladders boy
on your ladders
in you go in you go
andrew turns towards a ladder
as fate and placement would have it he is first in line
he puts his foot on the ladder when suddenly the sergeant stops him
listen to your sergeant
he pulls andrew aside speaking so that everyone can hear
if anybody turns back if any one of our boys come running towards you you take this rifle and you shoot them dead
do you understand
the sergeant pushes in on andrew private and intense
do you understand me
do you understand what im telling you son
you take this rifle and you shoot them dead
andrew looks ready to cry but manages to nod
albert turns to him only to be pushed back by the sergeant
up there son
up your ladder
up your ladder to your work
albert looks nervously back at albert comforting
andrew its good
nobodys retreating today
the commander arrives checks the time on his aides watch mounts his ladder and blows a whistle to signal the charge
a bagpiper plays as the men go over the top
david now heads up the ladder first
gun fire overhead albert steels himself then hauls himself over the top followed by the next man and the next
immediately machine gun fire whistles past we hear the screams of the first men who are shot
we follow albert
we are him
the ground is blasted there are bodies all around him
he tries to run but his feet sink into the mud
bullets fly past him
felled men are screaming at his feet in fear and agony
albert staggers forward
david is now right by him
they run together
albert looks round and suddenly david is hit
he falls to the ground screaming
albert instinctively goes to help
bullets shower all around him
just leave me
albert grabs him and drags him onwards with him david screaming at the pain albert grimly determined
shells explode around them as they stumble on
other men are running and falling
albert sees cover in a huge shell hole so dives into it for a moments reprieve from the gun fire
he sits in still terror for a moment
youll be all right here
youll be safe
someonell come for ya
its all right
its all right
were devon boys yeah
david looks at albert as though seeing him for the first time
albert races onward
back at the trench andrew waits terrified and then back out of the mist step two men heading back towards him
then a third
they suddenly catch sight of andrew waiting there with his gun pointed towards them
they slow down in the terror of the assault they had forgotten that death was waiting for them if they turned back
time seems to slow down andrew shifts his gun from pointing at one to the other we see their individual faces
they are all just boys really
and suddenly instinct hits andrew he charges up the ladder and forward firing past the three men towards the enemy
he chooses his death instead of theirs
a sudden barrage of machine gun fire all around him
cut back to albert who makes his way to the edge of the shell hole
bullets whizz inches from his head
he looks over to see a german machine gun position to his right
bullets whizz past forcing him to duck
andrew charges past other soldiers ignoring their warnings
albert continues forward to dive into another shell hole nearer to the german line
he scrambles from shell hole to shell hole
now hes very close to the machine gun position
albert takes a grenade fumbles with the pin as his hands tremble
he finally gets the pin out and he hurls the grenade at the machine gunner
we see the explosion and the machine gun stop
albert sprints over the top again and makes it all the way into the german trench
albert runs through the trench which seems curiously empty
albert swings round as he sees the startling face of a gas masked german holding a rifle on him
albert readies his bayonet but the man is dead slumped backwards against the side of the trench still upright
albert spins round his bayonetted rifle in front of him ready for action but there is only the ghostly sight of dead german soldiers
albert is alone everyone else is dead
all the dead wear gas masks
more british soldiers drop into the trench among them andrew
he stumbles in the mud drops his rifle recovers it and races through the trench
he glimpses albert ahead of him stalking through the mist
andrew breaks into a smile and rushes forward prompting albert to whirl with his rifle raised
albert pauses just in time
then he collapses against the side of the trench overwhelmed
andrew grabs albert and holds him up embracing him
albert can barely whisper we made it
we made it
a moment later the pair of them hurry through the trenches
albert spots more comrades around a corner and calls ahead to andrew
andrew this way out
suddenly another soldier leaps from a trench branch between them shouting in panic
an instant later a gas cloud blasts through the trench
andrew and albert look in horror
it spreads towards them too powerful to avoid
andrew is closest turns to albert with a helpless albie
before he takes the full power of it
an instant later the white deadly cloud encompasses albert too
close on hooves and boots slogging through muddy water several inches deep
friedrich is walking along leading topthorn and joey
topthorn is limping
something is wrong topthorn seems to be failing he coughs badly breathes strangely
friedrich stops to check on him
an officer notices
hey theres no stopping here
keep them moving
sir theres something wrong
this one needs to rest
theres no rest for them
move them along
move them along
instead friedrich leads the horses under the cover of a low bridge for a brief respite
a moment later topthorn collapses
please please please
stay on your feet
no no no
friedrich tries to help topthorn valiantly struggling to get up but finally sinks to the ground again
this time he lies semi conscious
he is dying
stay on your feet
joey deeply upset nuzzles his nose into topthorn but the life drains out him
friedrich is in panic at topthorns quick come on
friedrich continues to stroke topthorns head
joey pushes topthorn as if to stop him falling into unconsciousness
for a moment we think topthorn will come round but he slips away and all life leaves his body
friedrich solemnly strokes the horse knowing all is lost
joey does not understand
he pulls at topthorns reins as if trying to pull him upright
topthorns body is inert his head falls to the earth
joey will not give up he pulls at him desperately not understanding that topthorn has died
suddenly friedrich looks around
chaos all the german soldiers stream back past their position scrambling to get their guns and helmets
an officer charges down the bank next to the bridge screaming orders at friedrich
leave it private
friedrich tries to pull joey away to safety but joey will not leave topthorns body
friedrich pulls at joey but joey is too lost in his grief to care about or even notice the danger
come with me
go to hell
the officer nods to two other soldiers who pull friedrich to safety
as hes dragged away he screams at joey run
but this is all background noise to joeys profound refusal to accept topthorn is dead
he paws at the ground next to topthorn a horse standing over his best friend in a field and he will never leave him
and then suddenly from around a blind turn in the streambed a huge remorseless tank turns heading right for joey
he bolts galloping down the streambed until he reaches a barbed wire barrier a dead end
he attempts to run up the banks but theyre blocked as well
he rears up but the tank keeps advancing
the tank is about to crush joey
he has left it too late
he is about to die
but then counter intuitively he runs straight towards the tank and
leaps over it a leap he learnt from emilie
then scrambles up and over it and leaps down behind
joey keeps on running
he is wild frightened
joey is free in countryside but there is blood pouring from his leg clearly torn by his encounter with the tank
he runs on it is becoming night suddenly there are explosions to the left of him this fast elegant creature simply runs through the gaps between explosions
but as he charges on the sky lights up in the direction he is heading
he is suddenly in the thick of battle
a shell explodes next to him and he leaps entirely over a trench
another explosion sends him leaping but not far enough he finds himself crashing downwards and into a trench and he races through it and finds himself charging towards a german
both sides are equally startled joey charging through a thin trench lined with german soldiers the soldiers finding a live horse careering through them
in desperation joey scrambles out of the trench and once again rushes away from the fighting
but now it is very dark indeed he is stumbling as he runs there is blood mixed with the mud on his legs
now it is total night fog confusion he jumps again
and now everywhere there are potholes the land is massively uneven shells are exploding all around
and suddenly sees in front of him barbed wire
he crashes through it more he bursts through again now dragging barriers behind him the barriers tangle pulling him up short he flips and lands amongst even more barbed wire
he pulls and turns to release himself but it is impossible
the more he pulls the more firmly he is trapped
he rises up wild magnificent a beast fighting for his life
he is completely trapped
he cannot move
he cannot see
he is in pain
it feels like an end
stand to stand to a young soldier a geordie is on look out duty
he looks through a periscope
he alerts his colleague in his thick northern newcastle accent
theres something moving
what the hell is it
it looks like a cow
he passes the periscope to the second soldier
what the hell would a cow be doing out there
we see what he sees nothing but morning mist on the surreal landscape and something strange
it is joey in the distance that definitely isnt a cow
handing over periscope well what is it
we see an almost identical scene of several german soldiers looking out at joey just as the british soldiers had done
it cant be a horse
nothing alive could be out there
it isnt a horse
it isnt a horse
the first german looks through his periscope
we see what he sees joey in the mist yes its a horse
the second german looks through the periscope stunned
its a horse
a third german peter lowers his binoculars
yeah its a horse
now all the soldiers are gathering to look out at joey
a captain now has the periscope
well bugger me
its a horse
lads we should call him
how do you call a horse
the geordie starts clicking his tongue followed by all of his comrades
they all try to attract joeys attention with tongue clicks
the germans hear the clicks and respond with a chorus of whistles
now both sides are whistling
even the captain joins in
joey tries to rise but remains entangled
he whinnies in pain
peter lowers his binoculars
hes caught on the wire
oh sod it
geordie climbs up the side of the trench and waves a white handkerchief tied to the end of his bayonet
what do you think youre doing
get back do you hear me
corporal thats an order
geordie not receiving fire is emboldened to stand up
listen to him sir
we cant leave him
he waves the handkerchief to clearly signal he is no threat
the germans look at the young soldier making his way over no mans land
whats he doing
its a trap
no i dont think so
i think hes trying to help
the second german cocks his rifle and starts to take aim
scare him back into his hole
the second german takes a shot aimed over the geordies shoulder
the geordie crouches for cover waving his handkerchief more frantically
its a white flag ent it
you see the white flag
im just after tending to this here horse is all
the georgie marshals his courage and stands again waving the handkerchief
get back you stupid git
theres no fire from the german trenches
muttering to himself the geordie marches forward towards joey the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he leadeth me into green pastures he lay me down beside the
the geordie walks very slowly across the mud there are bodies the ground squelches beneath his feet
he waves his handkerchief as he walks
he crosses a narrow bridge that spans a flooded bomb crater
joey lying on his side wrapped head to toe in barbed wire covered in mud watches geordie approach
when geordie gets too close joey freaks out and begins thrashing about
joey whinnies a high scream of pain because wire is cutting into his hide in several places and as he thrashes it cuts him deeper
particularly worrisome is a strand thats wrapped around his head crossing right over his eye threatening to slash it
the geordie calls out in a soothing voice poor beastie
dont buck and wriggle so youre only shredding yourself
joey calms a little still moving his head up and down
youll blind yourself
he reaches joey and surveys the formidable tangle of wire in which joeys bundled
the geordie soothes and at the same time gingerly tests other strands trying to figure out where to begin
bugger me worthless i didnt think to bring gloves or something to cut he stabs his hand on one of the barbs
theres a noise behind him and the geordie turns around to see the peter the german from the trench standing several feet away holding some wire cutters
i thought perhaps you might need these
he holds out the wire cutters
the geordie still frightened stares stupidly at them
for the barbed wire
yeah yeah i
he reaches out and takes the proffered cutters
he returns to joey nervous about turning his back
he tries to figure out where to begin cutting
he lifts a long strand of wire that wraps around joeys neck stretches across his shoulder and torso and around one of his front legs
he puts the wire in the crux of the cutters and is preparing to snip when peter steps closer to him
thats a very long strand
when you cut it its going to release this he points to a wire wrapped around the wire the geordies lifting
then he points to two other wires similarly and this and this and theyll coil back rather violently which im afraid will only wound the poor fellow further
the geordie nods
you speak good english
i speak english well
re the cutters may i
the geordie hands them over and peter surveys the wires
what if we cut his head free first
so he wont try to stand up and blind himself
and then pity you didnt bring a second pair
then i could cut the wire here he points to one of the wires entangled with the strand hed been prepared to cut
peter stands and shouts in the direction of his trench
all at once one two three six pairs of cutters come soaring through the air and splash into the watery crater
moments later peter and the geordie kneel beside joey each with a pair of cutters
joey is calming down again
the geordie positions himself across joeys body so that when hes cut the wire it wont coil back and cut joey
peter positions himself to be able to cut the two wires in quick succession holding the first wire to stop it from springing back
joeys completely still now
peter points between joeys eyes
his blind spot
the cutters wont frighten him
if you could cut here holding this wire he points to wires that intersect the wire that crosses joeys eye
then he points to the wire across joeys eye
i could say no more im right behind you
as they reposition themselves the geordie says to joey and you understand whats happening do you not o best beloved
that you must lay so very nice and still
theres a lad youre a remarkable horse you are helping us help you
theres a lad
theres a remarkable lad
the geordie looks into joeys huge eye as he and peter get to work on their cutting
joey returns his gaze
so hows things in yonder trench
we read we knit sweaters and we train our rats to perform circus tricks
well if ever you need any more rats we can always send ours over
cause weve more than we need strictly speaking
besides they scare off all the pretty girls
our girls arent afraid of rats
big strapping german girls eh
kind what gives robust massages
and they bring rum cake on your birthday
both men smile at this while joey is completely still they work quickly in concert cutting the horses head free of the wire
joey raises his head gives it a shake neighs and then stirs a little
the two soldiers smile at one another
then they set about cutting the rest of the wire its much easier now
the geordie cuts through the last wire binding joeys legs
the two soldiers help as the horse staggers upright
look at that horse
look at the muscles hes got them long legs
theyre made for running horses
runnin away from danger
running away is all they have
yet we taught em opposite
running into the fray
and there he is
what a strange beast youve become
the geordie grabs hold of joeys halter though joey shows no sign of running
joey is finally free
the two men look at each other
i take him back with me yeah
since i supplied the cutters the horse is mine
this is fair no
in a pigs eye
hes english plain to see
oh you mean because hes so filthy
because hes so smart
and youre none too clean yourself
we could box
and the winner gets the horse
the geordie smiles
no thanks pet
must be careful not to start a war
patting his pockets do you have a coin of any sort
he takes a coin from his pocket hands it to the geordie who looks at it
all right fritz youre on
he flips the coin back to peter
my name is not fritz it is peter
peter im colin
you call it colin
peter spins it in the air and lets it fall into the mud
they look down
peter shakes his head resigned
thats the face of my kaiser and he does not look pleased with me
the horse is yours
they collect their helmets as snow begins to blow around them
gone quiet hasnt it
but wait half an hour and well be shooting again
im a terrible shot pete dont believe ill ever hit the target
he hands back the cutters
he notices the geordie has offered his hand as well
a beat then peter shakes with him
youll take good care of him yes
our strange beast
and you take care of your own strange self
peter tosses geordie his cutters
a pair of german cutters in memory of your handsome friend from dusseldorf
peter nods and walks back to his trench
as he goes the geordie calls after him ill use em back in the garden in south shields
you keep your head down now pete me lad
as he walks away peter turns back briefly calling remarkable
a remarkable horse
the geordie leads joey towards the british trenches
joey is now in the trenches splashing about in the ankle deep water
he seems enormous in this cramped labyrinth
he is led past the broken and wounded soldiers who look at him with amazement dumbfounded
it is a surreal image
the horse where horses shouldnt be
as joey makes his journey through the trenches soldiers excitedly gather to watch him come by taking pleasure in the saving of this single life
we arrive at a section we recognise as the place from where albert set off only the night before
sergeant martin is there as one man helps a wounded soldier into a medical area
it is david hobbling and looking shell shocked
another wounded soldier approaches but martin waves him on
were full up
david is seated next to albert who now seems in worse condition
his eyes are bandaged and hes wheezing
andrew is nowhere to be seen
as a medical officer checks albert
the gas got him we had to wait till morning
the medic moves to sergeant martin looking stricken
this cant be all of us
this is all
bellowing to the men all walking wounded away to the dressing station
away to the dressing station
joey is led into the hospital area beyond the trenches
the geordie leads him through the snowy streets
bandaged men strewn around wounded soldiers waiting for attention
the waiting soldiers gather to view the strange spectacle of the horse
at one of the dressing areas a nurse tends to alberts damaged eyes
behind him we see joey pass in the street but albert doesnt know it
joey limps his foreleg clearly injured
the geordie soldier stops outside a makeshift hospital
joey looks frail and exhausted
a doctor storms over from his patients
whats this doing here
we need a vet sir
there are no vets
weve scarcely any horses left
hes cut all over but this leg heres got the worst of it
geordie strokes joey as the doctor examines him
its probably tetanus
its no good
please sir the doctor heads back into the hospital dismissive
ive all these men to take care of corporal you can see that cant you
please sir this horse can pull through anything
the doctor absorbs his earnest appeal
elsewhere a line of soldiers waiting for medical assistance are curious about what is going on
blinded by gas eyes bandaged one of them turns toward the commotion
it is albert
what is it
its a horse they found wandering about in no mans land
easing him back onto a down you go
what kind of an horse
bloody miraculous kind of an horse be my guess
nothing makes it out of no mans land
albert lies there but cant let go of the thought miraculous horse
joey stands breathing very deeply
the doctor touches his wounded leg
the men from all over the medical area gather around joey concerned about their new heros pain
the doctor looks at the geordie and frowns shaking his head no
to the doctor he was alive ysee sir where nothing survives so to me and me mates to the men sir hes well we have high hopes for him you
should shoot him now
the geordie is broken hearted
oh but i cant
itd be a mercy lad that legs not going to mend
the doctor sadly addresses a nearby sergeant
put him out of his misery
the doctor nods his head towards joey
the sergeant sergeant fry takes his gun from his holster checks that its loaded
he turns to some nearby nurses urging them away
ladies if you please
total silence from the crowd who have gathered
they thought they were there to see something wonderful
and now they find that theyve gathered for an execution but cant take their eyes off it
the sergeant waves them back
all right back off
the geordie is the last to step away from joey
the sergeant draws breath before he steps forward to take aim
joey is totally still sensing the atmosphere
the sergeant cocks his pistol
suddenly there is a strange owl like whistle from fifty yards away
joey looks around startled
the sergeant turns joeys head back around raises his pistol once more
then the whistle again
even the doctor notices this time
slowly the crowd parts another owl whistle and we see albert his eyes bandaged walking forward blindly guided by the hands of the crowd
one soldier urges albert gently
do it again
one more whistle
and this time joey trots over to albert
the horse nuzzles into him
albert cant see joey but he touches him
where you been then hey
where in the world you been
he strokes joeys mane
joey responds becoming very still
the doctor approaches with the geordie
to the geordie do you know this man
the geordie shakes his head no
the doctor speaks to albert gently clearly he thinks hes dealing with a traumatized possibly crazy soldier
whats your name
albert realizing hes being addressed turns to the doctor
narracott private albert narracott sir
this is a random horse narracott and too badly injured
to the orderly is this man in your care
hes not random at all sir
hes my horse i raised him in devon
sir look at his legs
hes got four white socks hes brown all over points to his own and he has a white mark here like so
he makes the shape of a diamond with his hands
the doctor turns to the orderly
take him back
come on son
you cant see cause of the mud
the geordie looks around spots a bucket of water grabs it and uses a rag to clean joeys legs revealing the socks
the geordie looks at the doctor
four white socks
the doctor takes a rag himself and wipes joeys snout revealing the white diamond mark
the sergeant takes this in
and holsters his pistol
all right break it up
clear off the lot of ya
you see sir
hes not random at all
the doctor steps up to him
we will attend to your horse
patch him up best we can
treat him like the soldier he is
thank you sir
with one last amazed look at albert and joey the doctor returns to the hospital area
moments later albert the geordie and sergeant fry all lead joey through the snowy street together
sergeant fry strides into the middle of the throng of soldiers
it falls on me to give you some important news
at eleven oclock today in two minutes time the war will come to an end
shock from the troops
not the explosion of emotion you might have expected
albert enters his eyes still red but no longer bandaged
the king and queen thank you for your service
we have been victorious even if at a higher price than many of us might have imagined
when the bells ring out and they will in a moment for the first time for four years let us remember our brothers fallen in the field
and thank god for the end of this struggle and victory
and in the distance the church bells ring
joey stands tall eating some hay now healed
complete change of atmosphere
albert stands at attention with sergeant fry
a severe major is behind his desk
i dont understand sir
officers horses only
all other horses are to be auctioned immediately
that is a complete and bloody outrage
its the lads horse sir from devon
he raised him up from a pup he did
trained him right up to the day when the army came to town
these arent my orders sergeant
youll have to take him to market
albert puts on a brave face as he collects joey and leads him out of the stables in silence
as albert comes out the men have gathered
theres a strange sense of optimism for such a gloomy moment
the geordie comes up to albert and hands him a sheaf of pound notes
weve all clubbed together
its everything we have
theres twenty nine pounds there
buy him back
does the major know
the major put in ten
the geordie flashes a sly wink
mums the word where the majors concerned
your friend on the crutches over there he turns to indicate david lyons who nods at albert solemnly
even asked the major to say that joey was his an officers horse so that he could go back with the others
albert is amazed
he is about to show his gratitude when the sergeant major shouts come on narracott
get a move on
we dont want to miss the show
albert snaps to attention and begins to lead joey out of the parade ground with the other horses
as they walk off the sergeant silently adds some of his own money to the notes in alberts hand
the intense bustle of the market
farmers are gathered bidding for horses
seven pounds there
eight pounds here
a groom leads joey to the auction pen with other horses
ten pounds here
albert waits anxiously the geordie lad by his side as joey is led into the pen
nobodys gonna bid more than fifteen for a thoroughbred
they want work horses
the auctioneer starts the bidding on joey
we start at four pounds
the farmers seem disinterested shaking of heads
the bidding starts
five pounds six seven now it goes slowly eight nine ten
albert looks pleased at how its going
he feels the cash in his hand
it seems to stick on ten then a new hand comes up at the back of the auction it is a nasty looking moustached man
sergeant fry scowls
its the butcher from cambrai
hes been bidding for the best all morning
let me handle this private
he calls out fifteen and let that be an end to it
he looks daggers at the butcher
twenty of your english pounds
and let that be the end of it my friend
twenty five pounds
twenty six pounds
the men are all looking very worried
theres not much left
twenty eight pounds
any advance at thirty pounds
then from the back another new french voice
one hundred pounds
he steps to the front of the crowd and suddenly we see who it is
it is emilies grandfather
and sir if you bid against me i will sell the coat on my back and bid to one hundred and ten
and if you bid against me again i will sell my farm and bid to a thousand
everyone looks at albert who is devastated
albert is reeling
he hears the auctioneer repeat the final amount and brings down his gavel
one hundred pounds
going going gone
the soldiers slowly disperse leaving albert to stare at joey
it really is all over
the grandfather finishes paying for joey
albert and the geordie stand in front of the grandfather
sir ill give you all your money
everything you paid when we get back to england
ill give you twice you dont know anything about him
oh but youre wrong sir i know everything
yes you found him
i heard you found a horse in the wire between the armies no i found him he raised him the grandfather goes to joey and takes his reins
when i heard about the miracle horse i traveled three days because i knew whose horse it was
she saved his life
he was everything to her
he pauses briefly to collect himself
where is your granddaughter
the war has taken everything from everyone
he is all that i have left of her
the grandfather leads joey away
joey pulls firmly but not wildly on the rein the grandfathers holding
the grandfather lets go
he watches as joey walks to albert and nuzzles him
they have a moment together
the grandfather watches carefully
albert puts his face right near joey speaks gently
dont be worried boy when i go
i wont worry over you none
hey i found you didnt i and you found me
grandfather softens and begins to wonder about this soldier
and well both
well both know that we made it through
now go on
he leads joey back to the grandfather
were the lucky ones
always have been
lucky since the day i met you
he quietly hands over the reins
god be with you sir
the grandfather looks at albert then takes the regimental pennant from his pocket do you know what this is
its my fathers
its his regimental pennant
how did you come by this sir
grandfather hands albert the pennant
you may have this
albert takes the pennant and looks at it his eyes filling with tears
thank you ever so much for this sir
with a sigh and this
he hands albert joeys reins
albert turns to face him almost mute with disbelief
he reaches for his money
no no not necessary
he belongs to you
that is of course what my little girl would have wanted
and she was the boss
grandfather laughs then turns and slowly walks away
what was her name
turns back with a smile her name is emilie
albert gently embraces joey
suddenly we are back in the village in devon in the fold of the valley
a figure approaches silhouetted against the setting sun
naracott gathers the harvest then notices as the figure makes its way up the road to the farm
a man in uniform
on a magnificent horse
narracott meets them at the gate and we can finally see them clearly albert and joey
albert dismounts and removes his cap
an instant later mrs
narracott is hugging him for all that her life is worth
ted sees them and makes his way to the field gate
albert approaches and stops a slight distance away
ted opens the gate to stand before his son
albert slips something from his pocket and lets it unfurl in his hand teds campaign pennant
ted accepts it quietly then offers his hand to albert
they shake as men
and then slowly embrace as father and son
narracott joins them as joey looks on a small family and a beautiful horse finally home
