written by dan gilroy final draft a dad tosses a baseball to his son
the boy swings connects sends the ball flying
five years old
i remember that day
believe it or not i remember that hit
i remember it because of the smile that spread over my dads face
brandon shooting hoops
dad drinks a bud frowns as he misses
i wouldve stood there all day to sink one
just to see that smile
brandon runs wears a too big helmet and pads
a dog chases him as dad throws a football long pass time slows and to pop sports were a religion
to me it was about purity a place where all wrongs could be made right or at least temporarily forgotten
i was going to fill the whole house with trophies for him
there was no doubt in my mind i was going to make him happy
brandon catches the ball
blinding light loud cheering and our eyes adjust to see were in a stadium
its a night game
a play clock fills the screen
its the fourth quarter
seven seconds left
score cal west south west nevada university
a bruised and battered unlv quarterback gets a play from the coach straps on his helmet as he runs back to the huddle
the name on the quarterbacks jersey b
exhausted desperate faces come close hang on brandons every word last play
slant red right back on two
on two scottie
its a lock
a guaranteed td
ive already seen it
theres nothing to worry about cept one thing after we win and theyre shoving cameras in your faces i dont want to hear any hi moms
guys its overdone the fans are tired of it and if you have to thank some one you can just thank me
see you in the end zone
the teams breaks approaches the line
loud crowd roar
id been a quarterback since pee wee football
set high school records
won state championships
i wasnt driven by joy it wasnt winning as much as terror pure and simple fear of losing
south west nevada needs a score
seven seconds on the clock
win or lose this has been a spectacular season for lang
the big question should he turn pro now or wait until langs got the snap brandon drops back
a giant gets a hand on brandons jersey
brandon pulls free runs
opponents charge his way brandon vaults sails in the end zone scores
brandon rolls on his back as an opposing player hurtles in mid air unable to stop as plus pounds come crashing onto brandons leg
brandon clutches his strangely angled limb
my first thought was i can tape it and play next week
then i puked
teammates surround brandon many turning from the sight and brandons wheeled in
surgeons regard the leg
ivs are hooked up
whats the rehab time
the surgeons talk between themselves impressed by the break
when do i play again
one doctor examines his x rays
brandon grabs his smock
the patients got a question
a wavy world is melting far far away
footballs done son
brandons in a hospital bed
big leg cast
ivs in each arm
brandon its me
brandon opens his eyes focuses on his father older cheap suit beard stubble clutching a bouquet of flowers
i saw what happened on the tv
helluva thing that happening like that
edge what are you doing here
i brought some flowers
from downstairs in the shop
pressing the nurses call button no you gotta go wheres the nurse
im thinking of getting into a new program brandon
a nurse comes fast through the door watches unsure could you get him out please
its okay were fine im his father
just get out
brandon tries to rise ivs coming loose
the nurse takes his dads arm leads him out to the hall
pulling away straightening he didnt recognize me
must be all the drugs and all
boys been through a lot
handing the nurse the flowers if you could put these in some water and leave em in his room
before they die
brandons dad nods thanks departs down the corridor and vegas desert
a swnu car pulls up
the coach helps brandon out on crutches now
a middle aged woman and a teenage boy stand under a rusty awning waiting to greet him
it doesnt rain much in the desert
maybe it was that or maybe the look on my mothers face or how fast coach left after getting me up the steps but i swore then and there no
matter what id get back i would play again
the rooms packed
loud hip hop plays
brandon limps in on a cane
sprinters dart by
here comes brandon
several months have passed
big ass brace on his leg
a girls track team bounds past like a herd of gazelles
brandon presses on possessed
the teams practicing for a new season
brandons on the sideline flanked by the coach and team doctor
doc told me it would take years to heal
one bad hit and itd be over
but the team needed me and i had to play to get drafted
i figured id take a chance
brandon looks at the field the players the empty stands and crowded arena
brandons suited on the sidelines
a swnu player returns the ball
every minute of recovery id dreamt about this moment
there were nfl scouts in the stands
i knew what happened next
brandon leads his team onto the field
into the huddle lets ease back into it with our bread and butter td first play
were going deep
deep two on three
coming up to the line red
set brandon drops back
brandon about to throw when one of his own linemen is knocked into him and brandons off balance
too much pressure on that leg and in one horrible moment
the play whistled dead
it was over
i couldve gone out with class a gritty smile and a little wave to the crowd from a stretcher instead i opted to go psycho on national tv
the player who hit him leans down to help
brandon grabs his face mask starts punching
a referee steps in and brandon slugs him slams his face in the turf
linemen yank brandon off as the bloody ref struggles to get free and tv screen jim rome sports show a highlight reel plays a tape of the incident brandon seen
struggling with players as the roughed up ref crawls away welcome to the jungle
hey clones do you believe this idiot
that cannot happen
this is college football not the ultimate fighting championship
what we have here is too much muscle and not enough brain mass this is why we need a life time ban
make an example out of him
because the sport deserves better than this
talk to me
camera pushes in ecu on the tv as we hear it made all the highlight films
people wrote editorials
overnight i became the poster boy for the dark side of sports
the college yanked my scholarship and i was kicked out of school
the ref piled on pressed charges
my probation included counseling
a psychiatrist faces brandon
a clock ticks in the corner
who did the referee represent brandon
he represented the nearest guy i could grab
lets try again
camera moves ceiling level above a dreary space
passing over cramped cubicles
murmer of voices from each one
employees seen all reading phone copy into taping devices
sex lines astrology and get rich quick schemes are heard
football wasnt a sport it was my life
maybe i couldnt play anymore but i couldnt leave
so i went with it rode it out
then one day and it didnt take long i woke up at the bottom and i liked it so much i stayed for six years
the camera stops above brandon
he sits in his cubicle under a flickering flourescent light tossing a weathered football as he reads copy into a recording device
youve reached the jessica simpson hot line
jessicas going to tell you all about nicks surprise birthday party and her rockin new panty line at wal mart but first heres a little fan trivia to win a
vip gold package back stage pass to jessicas omnicon hotels summer tour a bull like boss appears at brandons cubicle entry got a job for you lang
im in the middle of taping
bauers sick cant update his betting line

brandon enters a co workers cluttered cubicle
numbers audio text the racket had a lot of names
brandon sits at his co workers desk
he picks up the text copy sitting beside the recording device looks it over this guys gig was sports handicapping
predicting winners for people who bet
i was supposed to just record his picks
the thing was i didnt agree with them
brandon starts changing game selections re writing the copy
my picks went and that weekend
by football season the job was mine
a football is seen rising and falling from brandons cubicle
he tosses the football as he records a new update kansas city is against the point spread versus division opponents coming off a monday night game
minus the six points
call tomorrow for my pro football game of the year tampa bay versus oakland
this is brandon lang saying good night and good luck everybody
brandon pops the tape
dons an old unlv windbreaker
he shoulders a beat up bike walks up front hands the tape to his boss
boss hands back a paycheck
regarding the amount i went in pro football sunday and hit my third straight monday night parlay
thats what you get paid for
i want a raise to bucks an hour
i dont make an hour
youre not picking percent
if youre so good then bet your own games get rich and send me a postcard from the riviera
boss pops brandons tape in a multi line answering system and brandon rides a beat up bike through downtown
brandon maneuvers through a bustling casino enters the sports betting room
he goes to a rack of printed bettling lines for the weekend games pockets a printed sheet sees a supervisor
hey stu wheres the action this weekend
were getting big money on tampa oakland
everyones jumping on tampa bay
supervisor stu you think
that games gonna be won by coaching stu
gruden put that tampa bay team together before he came to oakland right
he knows every weakness of that team and every strength
he knows brown only likes to catch over his left shoulder and hell have him double teamed to the right
he knows gannon always throws on a step drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of the field
gannonll be intercepted at least times on sunday
stu staring at him pained look you got sucked into tampa didnt you
stu manages a nod stu how many times do i have to bail you out
all right listen forget the point spread
oaklands going to win outright
bet the money line and bet big
brandon rides up
his younger brother denny metallica t shirt and some friends work on an old bondo pocked muscle car in the garage
i scrounged some old headers b
check it out
denny turns the key
the car rumbles to life
he revs the bored out engine flashes a shit eating grin
thats a righteous ride denny
moms readying for work dressed in croupier attire searching for something as brandon enters
dinners in the oven
where the hells my lucky crucifix
brandon reaches to a key rack hands it to her
she dons it
a man won at my table last night
tipped me out in color
i gave it to denny help him with college
brandon nods downs a carton of milk
mom about to go
mail came letter for you from chicago
you just tried out last week
they got back to you quick
thats a good sign
brandon opens it
words pop out arena football league
we regret to inform you
but based on your performance
at least they kicked me a cap
filled with exercise equipment
brandon pins the letter to a wall covered by dozens of rejections national football league canadian football league arena football league
brandon changes into shorts
and now we see hes in amazing shape
could maybe still play pro
but that two foot scar running the length of his leg makes you wonder
as brandon pumps it out we realize he still has a dream of coming back a dream we sense by his intensity is fast slipping away and brandon pedals to
work when his cell phone rings
you went last sunday
picking percent winners since opening weekend
ive been following you
im a big fan brandon
a big fan
howd you get this number
if you want picks call my line
what i want brandon is for you to come to new york and work for me
who is this
this is walter abrams
i dont know if you know me but i run the biggest sports service in the country
hell i started the industry
ask anyone even that reprobate boss of yours
its my job to keep track of whos doing what and what youre doing should be rewarded
one day youll look back see this was one of lifes defining moments
allow me to paint a picture for you

aside to masseuse right there
fuck that hurts
do me a favor and lose my number i gotta go to work
brandon hangs up and brandon hefts the bike down the hall reaches his cubicle to find his phone ringing
picking up hello
its me again
this is a joke right
a joke can be the ultimate intellectual pursuit sometimes
this is just a job offer
in your top drawer theres an envelope with your name on it
brandon opens the drawer pulls an envelope and a ticket
thats travel cash and an airline ticket
its not a magic trick brandon
i paid someone to put it there who incidentally said the place reminded him of a turkish prison
i dont have to tell you youre wasting your time there brandon unless this is a part time gig unless youre planning some kinda comeback in which case i request
you use a fraction of your talents and weigh the odds of that dream becoming reality
two leg fractures
passed on by every conceivable team in the league
any chump can make that call and anyone who clears the boards the way you do week in and week out should live in a penthouse on park avenue which
is not for you to construe im offering that to start but keep these stats up working for me and ill have you in one in less than a year
unless of course youre a village kind of guy
brandon glances at the old faded football in his back pack
run the numbers do the math
hold on a sec muzak
brandon juggles the phone searching finds a pay stub
brandon crosses it out writes
he crosses that out writes
brandon pulls a quarter flips it
the coin bounces spins falls and brandon hefts a duffel bag sees an asian driver chauffeur uniform mirrored shades holding a sign reading b
lang and brandon eyes a basket of croissants and juice grabs a danish takes a bite sees the driver watching in the mirror
im gonna pay
ill pay you pay me
im milton i drive for him
i thought it was a service
moving to the jump seat seeing milton is driving very fast so whats the deal with this guy

walters driver hit me with his car
i lie on ground make it look worse than is big car you know maybe get some money

slicing the air with his hands walter get out
i say his driver cant drive he say youre right
i say damn right
he ask if i can i say hell yeah
he take hat off driver give it to me
every day with walter is
next to the brooklyn bridge
manhattan rises across the east river
the limo pulls up
brandon steps out regards the structure
exhaust fans dot the second floor
satellite dishes on the roof
security cameras everywhere
brandon follows milton through a large wildly furnished apartment
they pass an large library dominated by rows of bleacher seats from the old polo grounds
a hot dog stand sits outside a wine cellar
toys tell us theres a child in the house
a cha cha plays from a stereo
milton stops at a set of doors
about to knock when bring him in
walter smokes a cigarette talking on the phone as an assistant in a separate adjoining space handles four ringing phones
across the room a large wall is filled with tvs each turned to a different channel no sound
ill hire the trainers too
well run it by them you wont know until you try
so they can stay the night
ill put em up at the plaza nice suite park view
okay double it
everythings about money
look on sunday my daughter an angel turns six its not likely to happen again
she loves elephants
your circus has i only want one my little girls happiness is in your hands
beat icy edge i dont need parenting advice from a guy who doubles as a clown
i want an elephant and ill pay
whatll it take to grease your wheels and get one this weekend
intercom his assistant furious find ringling brothers
get me on the horn with someone who understands profit
walter sees brandon
he removes the headset
dons his glasses
whoa look at you
the marlboro man
feeling his bicep jesus youre in great shape
ive been in better
assessing brandon as he speaks modestys not a virtue its a vice as evil as vanity
there are rules to success brandon and this is rule number one know what you know and know what you dont know and know i gotta know everything you know
as soon as you know it if not sooner
what the hell is that
i said smile
ever sell before
if you can sell youll never starve
ever speak in public
anything like that
i played quarterback in college
i know im talking about not in uniform
i used to sing at church
so youre religious
i dont know
certain things you either are or you arent
which is it
when i was a kid i thought i wanted to be a pastor
obviously not now
i mean yeah i believe in god
what do i care
besides its against the law to hire based on religious orientation
youre not a republican are you
silent beat staring at him youre scaring me son
whats with the deer caught in headlights vibe
you were a quarterback for gods sake
that was six years ago
cmon you won three conference titles at a major university
you think i went to college
big word huh
know what it means
partially by reading sure but mostly by keeping my eyes open and asking a lot of stupid fucking questions
i swear to god im looking at myself years ago
a taller more athletic version maybe but the resemblance is remarkable
walter crushes out the cigarette sprays air freshener
im not supposed to smoke any more among other things
its bad for my condition
so before i die did you do anything other than the sports phone in vegas
just the number recordings it was full time i mean we got bucks a call
chump change brandon
were angling for bigger fish here
you see the networks dont talk about it and uncle sam cant tax it but sports gambling is a billion dollar a year business
these gamblers have needs brandon
come monday morning after a losing weekend a lot of them have big needs
walter presses a button and the tvs fill with football games
thats every pro game played last sunday
do you know why monday nights the most watched game of the week
its because mondays the last chance bettors have to climb out of the hole before paying their bookies on tuesday
sports bettings illegal in states including this one but what we do is legal its exactly the same as a stock broker only instead of touting stocks we advise people
on how to bet
we make the big money off our client list
you see when a client wins with our advice we take a percentage which they gladly give to keep getting our picks
when they lose we get zip
so the object here my tall athletic religious friend is to win
walter clicks a control and his face fills the wall of tvs
phone numbers and messages football selections
college and pro
flash on the screens
its a high octane infomercial for sports gamblers
hello this is walter abrams and welcome to the sports advisors and week three in professional football
after a nice five day vacation on my yacht i cant be any more ready than i am right now
studying the mismatches this weekend i can only conclude theyre giving my handicappers a license to steal
i want you to take out a blank tv walter cond check right now go on do it and write in as much you want to cash it for on
tuesday thats how much money were making for you this weekend
year in year out no stock matches our return and for the first time in the history of the company im releasing our three team college and pro parlays absolutely
this is why in a business with a higher turnover rate than leona helmsleys maid staff were still going strong after years
im giving these picks away
bet on it
were looking at a big money weekend so lets get right into it with our panel of experts freeze frames himself to brandon my cable show
tapes thursday airs saturday and sunday morning
hell i need a new barber
the man should be shot
look at my hair in the back
howd you afford that yacht if the picks are free
there is no yacht
good keep asking question
you didnt answer about the free picks
whats on the second floor
thats where we print the money
no that clears up pretty much everything
we got some good stuff to work with
assistant over intercom ringling brothers on one
ever have a manicure
because you need one
besides theres a girl you gotta meet
whats she like
beautiful youll like her answering the phone this barnum or bailey
toni morrow looks into camera styles an attractive ish womans hair as the woman regards her face in a mirror woman im just thinking of doing some work around the
tighten it up a bit
a lift here look see these lines
i see a beautiful woman
what are you all of
i have a girlfriend she was stunning went in to tighten it up a bit and came out with a permanent smile
even when she cries she looks like shes laughing
another shes on her third eye lift
her skins so tight i swear if you put an egg shell on her butt shed look like a baby bird
im just thinking of a tune up
oh yeah first its a tune up then its something else and one day youll come teetering in with your new cs and a stretched face and you wont be
able to say how unhappy you are because of all the collagen they shot in your lips
do youself a favor
skip the surgery and get a shrink work on the inside
easy for you to say
you used to model
the other women customers listening nearby nod in agreement
oh yeah thats true
those were the good days
sometimes i like to just curl up on the ledge with my box of retouched photos and reminisce about rehab
tightly wound today arent we
must be the coffee talking
handing her a fashion magazine here read a fashion magazine
feel more insecure about yourself
toni walks through the shop checks her watch passes a row of women getting lunch hour nail jobs
brandons squeezed in among them
only guy there
cotton between his toes post pedicure
hunched and uncomfortable as the women around him discuss boyfriends and relationships
walter said youd stop by
nice to meet you
immediately re the pedicure this was his idea
he makes all his employees do this
before they start work
ive never had my nails done before
i can see that
putting his hands in water strong hands
do you drink
no do you drink
are you a drinker
ive been pretty focused on staying in shape
i mean a beer once in a while
toni what about gambling

leaning in ya know toni this is my first time in town
im not used to how fast things run around here
im wondering if youd like to have dinner tonight
lets get to know each other without so many people around
he didnt tell you
brandon walter and i are married
walter just said i was meeting a woman
he acted like
walters got a weird sense of humor
look he has a big bright beautiful spirit youll love working for him but hes held together by meetings
if it has anonymous at the end walter goes
he has to
he also has to be very careful who he lets into his life
in most ways walters brilliant but he can be bullshitted and i cant
so he sends em over to me before he hires em
youre kidding me
this was an interview
howd i do
except for an illegal forward pass perfect flying colors
im late for my next appointment
toni walks away glances back smiles and brownstone
camera favors the ground floor windows
walter vo the apartment on the first floor is yours
you have satellite tv a gym you want to relax theres a jacuzzi tub the size of a kiddie pool
a phone and a computer on an empty desk
two tvs mounted on the wall
walter shows brandon around
im starting you on the numbers same gig you did in vegas
youll make your picks and record them every day once a day monday through friday and five times a day on weekends
each calls worth bucks a shot
right now we get a few dozen hits a week
we should be doing triple that
im sending down some test copy
before you record it a little advice
regards the phone your pitch sucks it doesnt exist
the pieces are there we just gotta bust you out
from now on you have a new name john anthony the million dollar man
whats wrong with brandon lang

brandon pumping it out

the past is merely a prologue
in this job you have to push the envelope every day
brandon glances at a nearby table catches the eye of a stunning girl sandwiched between two middle aged overweight men
walter catches the eye contact before she looks away
the girl seems bored as the two big men heartily chow down

beauty and the beasts

hey here we go brandon your girlfriends going to the bathroom
the girl glides by their table
heads up a flight of stairs
well get moving slick
brandon after that introduction
hey i just raised the bar
john anthony could close her
brandon looks from walter to toni
id prefer brandon
he walks through the restaurant up the stairs as the womens room door opens and the girl emerges before him
she regards brandon
jaded disintested air
stepping past excuse me
i just want to get to know you
you just want to get into my pants
i want to get into your mind your heart your soul
i dont see you wearing any pants in this equation
this could go either way before the girl smiles
whats your name
beautiful name for a beautiful girl
brandon leans in close talking too low now for us to hear
alexandria laughs at something he says and brandon and the girl all over each other and th floor of a luxury high rise
in the darkness brandons seen naked on a big bed girl straddling him body rising and falling pace quickening back arching
brandon looks up girl silhouetted against the floor to ceiling windows city spires sparkling all around and walter and brandon reach the second floor landing stand outside a solid steel
everything youve ever dones been leading up to this moment
put your ear to the door
its the sound of possibilities
the din of greatness
walter turns the knob brandon nearly tumbles through and another world
a dozen salesmen work in a large room
numbers are called out
a half dozen girls stroll the space deliver betting and tip sheets
we use the number and free tips to bait the hook
then the bettors are bounced to our sales staff
stopping at the front desk talking to a pretty brooklyn girl youre looking lovely today tammy
give it up baby you know what i need
tammy smiles hands walter a long list of names and numbers
walter studies the sheet as he walks brandon through the room
this is the days phone sheet its a list of everyone whos called
only way to keep track of the action
all leads equal money
brandons pov walking by salesmen doing their thing
the first is a chain smoker battering ram tone
this is southie
southie did i not tell you that game was going over the total
now stop holding back and lets make some serious dough
whats our game plan this week
mitch collect from your bookie wire our pitiful frigging share and then well discuss the goddamn game plan
the second mans herbie
trust me were going to turn all this around
im aware last weekend was difficult
well of course i do thats a substantial sum cupping the phone to walter hes a bit miffed about our picks fuck him if he cant take a joke
youre telling me that all this is legal
it better be
five of these guys are off duty cops
were just advising people how to bet not making the bets for em
cmon i want you to hear our best salesman reggie hawks
it says here your minimum bets five grand so lets be honest now can you move large on this game or not
i dont have time for this shit jimmy
i know youre a loser because if you were such a big winner you wouldnt have paid money to call me today
vegas is calling im putting you on hold
pressing hold whats up big wally you slummin today
this the new kid
brandon lang meet reggie
youre the qb that went off on the refs
brandon shamefully nods yeah but you covered
shit as much money as the refs cost us every year that was pure
hell i like you already
even if you did get the best office
re an item on the sports ticker barkers not playing this weekend
no hes in the middle of renegotiating
its a tantrum hell play sunday
walter and reggie exchange a glance they can use that and angle on two glassed in offices overlooking the sales room
one office is crammed with clutter bears a prominent keep out sign on the door
inside a big bearded man wolfs a breakfast burrito scours the sports pages
in the other office sits a suited studious looking man in his s talking on a headset jerry sykes types stats into a computer as he fields a call
three other computer screens flash football info and data
large complex wall graphs chart esoteric team trends
a framed promotional picture shows jerry standing in a bank vault the banner type below reading jerry the source sykes creator of the sykes sports wagering system
typing on a computer as he speaks i know its a new stadium im asking if they used astroturf or astroplay
astroplay it has a rubber silica base like ground up tires
look i dont have time to explain abrasion indexes and resistance scales to you trust me it makes a big fucking difference
looking through the glass seeing walter showing brandon around so bribe a security guard sneak in with the grounds crew do what you have to this is what i pay
walter and brandon enter
a glass partition overlooks the sales room
i had three guys who picked games
i fired one last weekend
im giving you his job
this is your office
from here out your picks are going straight to our biggest customers
how do you like it
whats not to like
jerry sykes appears at the door
fast glance at brandon attention to walter the miami new york point spread shifted a half tick up to
what do you think
miamis still a lock
the win loss ratios and rpi ratings are off the charts
im keeping it on my sheet
jerrys our top handicapper came to me straight out of grad school
jerry meet the new kid in town
whoa phone guy makes good
big jump from the numbers
watch out you dont get a nose bleed
just kidding best of luck i gotta get back to work
pleasure meeting you
by the way jerry new yorks gonna win straight up
they always play the fish tight
tonight its foregone they win outright
listen up stick to college sonny
you have to work up to pro ball around here
nice try though
watching jerry walk away i got three guys who can handicap and who can sell but i never had one who could do both not really not until now
you mean me
john anthony doesnt exist
thats a shock cause im standing in his office and youre sitting in his chair
look making predictions is one thing but pushing people to bet its not me
get real this country was built on gambling
look at wall street one big casino
the state spends millions hawking the lottery
if people want to pay for advice on who to bet who are we to say no
stop being selfish spread the word
check your bible brandon tis better to give than receive
you got a whole room full of salesmen
big bettors dont want to talk to a middle man they want to speak to the guy making the picks and youre picking percent winners
whats the matter
gonna lose your purity
cmon what do you think selling is
were just talking a few well timed phrases
lets start with an easy one
a throw away
i dont want your money i want your bookies fucking money
i dont want your money jesus dont start that shit again
i dont want your money i want your bookies money
what happened to the fuck
nothing i just dont talk like that
i cant have someone working for me who cant say fuck
its not that i cant
why do i have to
because theres no other fucking word that can convey the precise feeling and fucking flavor of lifes various predicaments and certain concepts the way a well placed fuck can
fuck is your friend
fuck can be your best friend
im happy for you and your friend walter but im not using it
chaucer used it years ago
it was good enough for him
cmon calling out to the salesmen this fucking guy has a problem saying fuck
a chorus of fuck yous fill the air
cmon repeat after me fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuck he fuck she fuck me fuck them fuck me try it
its not me
let it go
almost as good
well keep working on the other thing
so you really like new york in tonights game
looking down fifth
thousands of heads in a hurry to get somewhere
here comes brandon and walter
where are we going
continue your education
a dozen people fill an upscale living room
a well dressed woman answers
walter and brandon stand before her
were here for the gamblers anonymous meeting
the group sit in a circle listen as a businessman near tears gives his testimony
i mean youd think with two mortgages out repo guys staking out my car my job on the line and my wife threatening to leave youd think id have the
goddamn brains to stop instead of staying in the chase doubling down which of course is what i did
i know im sick because i keep thinking if i just pulled that game out then i got a lock on the parlay and im flush going into monday night
and breaking down unable to continue its a disease leon
admitting you have a problem is the first step
then i guess im doing pretty good because i got one big fucking problem
everyone joins in
walter suddenly stands
brandon watches concerned
my names walter
im new to the group
various hellos hi
ive been going to meetings like this for years
once a week every friday night for years
this my friends is my th consecutive meeting
enthusiastic applause thank you
and my hand to god i havent been to a track casino or bet a game that whole time
not a cent
murmurs of approval ive listened to thousands of sob stories by people like leon here and i gotta say leon if i learned one thing its that gambling is not
not even close
youre a lemon
like a bad car theres something inherently defective in you
all of us here were lemons
big juicy acidic ice tea flavoring lemons
we look like everyone else but were defective because when most people make a bet they want to win while we the degenerate gamblers of the world were subconsciously playing
all humans like going to the edge of the abyss but what makes us different is we go all the way and hurl ourselves off into the void
and we like doing it so much we do it time after time after time
i always felt most alive when they were raking away the chips and every one here knows what im talking about
people like us even when we win its just a matter of time before we give it all back
but when we lose and i mean the kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size of a decimal point theres a moment when youre standing there
and youve just recreated the worst possible nightmare this side of malignant cancer for the th goddamn time and you suddenly realize hey im still here im still breathing im still alive
in order to really live you have to be aware of your own mortality and a losing bet of a certain size is one of the best ways i know
of getting that feeling
when you win you defy death but when you lose you survive it and thats remarkable
us lemons we fuck shit up on purpose
we need to constantly remind ourselves that were alive
gamblings not the problem leon your fucked up need to feel something to convince yourself you exist to test whats really real thats the problem
youre the guy i see on tv every weekend selling betting picks
this guy peddles a tout service on tv
check the charter buddy we all left our jobs at the door
you gonna toss an ex alcoholic bartender out of an aa meeting

the big bearded man exits his pack rat cluttered work space strides to the office coffee machine pours a quick cup
brandon approaches extends a hand

ducking back into his office whatever
the man shuts the door leaves brandon looking at the keep out sign
southie stops for a coffee has seen the exchange

salesmen work the phones glance at him as he passes

well thats a thoughtful response
here i was worried youd rush your decision
its the only move
for six years ive been living on ramen noodles
for the first time in a long time ive got something going
if that means i gotta do a little acting fine
living not acting
you understand that as of right now brandon lang with his fettucini knee and his self fucking pity is as flat dead as donald trumps hair and john i can

brandons face fills screen
scissors come in start cutting
toni begins bringing john anthony to life
brandon chatting her up in the chair toni laughing at something he says and brandon new haircut stands in private room modeling a suit
walter nearby looks through racks of clothes with a salesman
brandon new haircut new suit walks through the showroom as walter talks with a dealer
i need a new car for my friend

walter do you trust him
with my wife naked
calling to brandon in that case which one do you want
brandon comes over runs his hand over a sleek silver sl
i think he likes that one
the silver sl pulls to the curb
license plate reading king
a pair of shoes emerge
brandon stands on the sidewalk as the doorman comes up eyes the car
doorman ill watch it for you
seeing the license plate whats king
handing him a card i dont lose
brandon heads into the bar meets walter and a group of heavy hitters outside
john anthony instantly comes alive and brandon and walter sitting side by side getting made up
make up artist to brandon youre sweating a lot honey
brandon nervously regards himself in the mirror
im scared shitless
dont worry about your lines its all scripted
youve been here before kid just think of it like a football game
this is different
theres no opponent
perfect then youre a lock to win
the camera tracks to a talk show like set dominated by a triangular table three chairs and a backdrop bearing a sports themed logo and the words the sports advisors
brandon sits between walter and jerry increasingly nervous as the cameras push close
chuck arrives loud suit takes a seat at the end of the table head down averting eye contact with everyone
walter were not getting your audio
fumbling with a clipped on mike somethings wrong here
leaning over plugging in a wire your leads loose i got it
im talking to the tech guys about going wireless
jerry looks at brandon staring anxiously at the teleprompter
john anthony huh
all i sees another wannabee in a dollar suit
word to the wise save the clothes you came in
five four three two one note walter and the panel follow text from a teleprompter
welcome to this weeks edition of the sports advisors
americas premier sports information program with myself walter abrams jerry sykes chuck adler and a truly gifted newcomer to the sports advisor panel a substantial find john anthony
were entering week six in pro football
this is when the cream rises to the top
this is when things get hot
its oven mitt time
this is big time ball season so lets get right into it with the wizard of odds jerry the source sykes
jerry whats the sykes system predicting for this weekend
walter my patented computer models tell me were looking at nothing less than the perfect storm of betting opportunities
but first last week i cashed in a big time call on on chicago as an outright winner over indianapolis making it my th straight top selection winner right here
on this tv show
this sunday i have match ups i absolutely love including miami at new york
stats rankings records weather the sykes system uses proven indexs to eliminate the guesswork from sports wagering
without my patented computer based picks you have a better chance of seeing god knocking on your door with five strippers and a bag of bolivian cocaine than winning on
call me for my five games
our experts know how to read between the lines we know how to analyze a point spread were not pulling rabbits out of a hat here
certainly not chuck adler turning to chuck chuck youd probably eat that rabbit if you got your hands on it
coming suddenly wildly alive hell yes with a side order of fried bookmaker
im the grim reaper of bookmakers
ive put more bookies out of business than the i
how many gamblers did i bail out last weekend with my game of the year
denver a point underdog beating cincinatti by two touchdowns
a bettor made
a bettor made
ive got six games on sunday im releasing absolutely free
these games are a burial
a blow out
a human lock
you can bet your childrens unborn childrens children on these six games absolutely free
finger in his ear holy christ i forgot my earplugs
take a break before you blow a gasket well get back to you after my hearing returns
saturday comes before sunday and looking at this saturdays college match ups is the last but certainly not least member of the sports advisors john anthony
reading off the teleprompter john anthony here the million dollar man with the billion dollar plan
from wall street to tokyo to hollywood all your big money stays and plays with me
beat processing this suddenly going off the teleprompter script someone wrote some great stuff for me here but the million dollar man i dunno it sounds kinda small somehow
i mean maybe if you change that m in million to a z i could get behind it
they tried all sorts of names wanted to call me the magic man but picking percent winners sounds pretty scientific to me
so lets just call me john
i was a quarterback
and every qb knows the key to victory is anticipating the ability to see the future and react to it
that is what i do thats the truth and what do they say about the truth walter
it bites you on the ass
not in my case
you tell us jerry
it sets you free
thats right but with me it makes you m o n ee
im picking percent is that unbelievable
well it used to be
i know the leagues
i know the players
i know the game
im your friend on the field
your insider on the outside
you cant do what i do if you havent been there
played at the level i have
maybe youll get lucky guess right once in a while but these match ups wont be called consistently by anything other than experience
throw out every system you possess
keep your friends but toss their opinions out the window
its time to change i would if i could to i can and i am
you wanna know who i like call that little number at the bottom of your screen
camera on walter watching proudly and walter walks down the dim hall looks in on julia sleeping
then someone bumps into something
a light goes on
toni sits up in bed sees walter fully dressed across the room holding his shoes
im not here
go back to sleep
its four in the morning
continues to his dresser manic what a show
you should have seen him
im sitting there watching him roll and i swear he made me want to grab a phone and call

tonis whisperings become a constant soothing mantra
walters eyes close
dressed in sweats and sneakers
toni loosens his laces covers him with a blanket slides under the covers
toni kills the light
seen in darkness
holding walter close draping a protective arm around and a sledge hammer smashes through a wall
deliverymen dolly in new desks and chairs to accomodate more salesmen
southie and reggie at the water fountain watch the room expand
you see him this morning
wearing those suits to work now
he keeps picking percent ill press the fuckers for him
walter walks in stops at the front desk speaks to tammy
what a weekened
helluva christmas bonus if this keeps up
whered you hide the phone sheet
tammy locates the sheet hands it to him
walter studies it starts away
he sees something stops

toni carrying groceries and julia dressed in ballerina clothes enter walk into the kitchen

julia runs off to her room when toni suddenly spies a tacky womans jacket draped on a chair
toni regards it and the camera tracks toni through the apartment
down the hall
a man and woman as walter emerges from his office with a call girl
hes pulling bills from his wallet
heres something extra for a cab

the call girl slides by shows herself out

walter grimaces clutches his side
walter pops one two three pills from a vial lets them settle as julia princess clothes runs down the hall leaps in his arms

brandon practicing john anthony expressions
a pretty make up artist finishes touching him up

jerry sinks into his seat
walter turns to brandon

walter toni and brandon all laugh
the three of them doubled over on the dark deserted street
man screaming from above
the ring of a phone begins bleeding in and new furniture and sports photos on the walls suggest the passage of time
brandon stands before a mirror being fitted for a suit by a tailor
he has a cigar in one hand coke in the other talks into a headset as he watches the tailor work

amir sharply attired stands outside his business leaning against a brand new red ferrari as he talks on the phone

walter enters slaps an airline ticket on his desk

novian one of the biggest sports bettors in the world

flight leaves laguardia in minutes
activating the headset i gotta go ma
son of a bitch my own fucking mother hung up on me
an airliner roars in for landing
walter and brandon pass through frame
what do you know about him
not much cept for the fact hes a world class prick
bastard treated me worse than my hong kong tailor

ive been trying to bag this guy for years
do you have any idea what this is worth
no but i want a bonus if we pull it off
look at me

walter suddenly slows winces
he angles toward a bathroom
walter grabs for a water fountain misses suddenly collapses
your vial wheres your pills walter
walter finds the vial pops it his chest heaves and the pills spill on the floor
walter looks wide eyed up at brandon mouths big one
brandon frantically loosens walters shirt
a crowd gathers
a businessman pulls a cell phone dials
hold on walter were getting help
oh my god

youre gonna be fine
to the crowd we need a doctor
is there a doctor
brandon save your strength

several stunned onlookers run for help
walter fading fast
i believe you
i believe you love me
i love you too
just one thing save your strength walter
would you love me if this was a joke
brushes himself off
to the crowd im okay
mustve had too many peanuts on the plane
the confused onlookers drift away
you sick fucking fuck
that was too goddamn fucking far
you werent listening
youre not paying attention to me
theres no such thing as too far
push everything as far as you can
push it until it starts pushing back and then push some goddamn more
remember that when youre with this guy today
drapes dance before the open doors
brandon and walter sit in the living room
i start to die fuck the hospital just sit me down i wanna kack here
a beefy bodyguard enters followed by a tan broad shouldered man of
walter extends his hand
what can i say
this is my associate john anthony
novian nods settles in a chair
walter and brandon sit
you should know i think that most sports services are a complete scam
however i hear your boy heres having quite a season
whats your system
looking around our system
fuck that whats your system
novian stone faced glances at his watch when its a privilege to meet you mr
you have a beautiful home
lets start with how much you bet
a million a game across the board
nice round number is that our ceiling here
is that the most were working with
were not doing anything until i hear how you feel about this weekend
do you rent that yacht out there
i own it
well sir thats how i feel about this weekend
that may sound cocky i dont care
i didnt come down here to lie
do you have inside information
if i did i wouldnt share that with you
my record speaks for itself
the truth is i know these teams better than they know themselves
im going for this weekend and that includes the monday night parlay
why should i believe you
with all due respect mr
novian you cant afford not to
i can afford to do any damn thing i please
what im saying is can you can anyone for that matter afford to lose as much as a man like you probably needs to bet to feel a win
winnings a funny thing mr
its one of those rare commodities on earth money cant buy
or was until you called me
a tight grins glued to walters face
the price is a quarter million mr
novian up front in addition to a percentage of every game you win
i never pay anything up front
and weve never charged it before
but with what youre betting up fronts a bargain
you want this weekends winners thats my offer
take it or leave it
standing step outside
brandon and walter exchange looks unsure where this is going
novian and brandon regard a group of girls lounging topless by a pool
ever pick oranges mr
i have in fact its how i started
see those girls down there
pretend theyre oranges and pick some ripe ones
take em upstairs and build some character
abrams and i need to refine the terms
brandon goes to an ice filled cooler by the door pulls a bottle of champagne carries it dripping down to the pool and a football betting form fills frame
two columns of teams seen
point spreads penciled in between them
of games checked off
monday night the last to be decided
pull back to show brandon in his office the unfinished form before him
a young salesman appears at the door
they need it mr
brandon picks up his pen regards the box for monday night seattle or new orleans
the point spread is seattle minus
a box beside it is for the over under
that number is
brandon about to pick when he stops looks up smiles three questions
whats your mothers name
what street did you grow up on
who do you like monday night
i dont know
thats your job
ill do your job tomorrow today you do mine
what are you talking about
you know whos playing
seattle versus new orleans
i guess i like seattle giving the two points
writing on the form over or under
you cant do that
sure i can
over points or under
brandon checks it off gives him the finished form
im not handing that in
like a million dollars is going on that game
like a lot more than that
i think we know i can pick
today im picking you
the outcomell be the same
what if im wrong
didnt they tell you
there is no if
monday night football
final seconds of a hard fought game
the seattle quarterbacks driving completes a long pass to a receiver whos brought down at the new orleans yard line
they score we win
al michaels vo from tv kuhns stopped at the
seattle down by three
two seconds on the clock
kuhn suffered a concussion last week and with that foot injury in the first quarter he has no mobility hanratty drops back hes out of the pocket breaks one tackle
throws downfield its tipped
raymonds got it
breaks the plane
seattle takes it to
they win by three
what a game
the buzz in the bg explodes as we see every employee is packed into walters office
riot of celebration all around
champagne corks start popping
someone hits the remote and the wall of screens fill with a jamming mtv video
the lights dim
people start dancing
cell phones start ringing and various salesmen into phones call back tomorrow
who knows who he likes next week you fucking degenerate
i dont have anything yet
the young salesman who made the monday night and over under picks talks excitedly to southie and reggie
he kinda mesmerized me see and like spock or something i visualized seattle and the over and he wrote it down
said picking me was the same as him doing it
what kinda power is that
who fucking cares
jerry sykes stands nearby listening
whoops of excitement as walter jumps up on his desk starts throwing cash
jerry moves through the raucous crowd finds brandon against a wall out of the fray watching walter hurl money in the air
or should i say john
either way its amazing
i must say i am impressed
letting salesmen make your picks
watching walter hurl money best get in there and collect some of this jerry
the way youre picking youre gonna need some for a rainy day
keep talking sugarmouth
must feel pretty good to be that plugged in
you got a good streak going
well enjoy it while it lasts
the gambling gods are a fickle bunch sooooo easily offended
brandon makes his way through the room reaches walter
here get you teeth fixed

wraps an arm around
puts him in a headlock
honey you dont know what fair is
whats fair is not giving you the money

if you want something from me more than a gazunheidt after a sneeze you have to do more than think about it

john anthony would know that

brandon pulls free
mtv pounds from the tvs people dancing all around
toni walks up

walter pulls her close moves with the music

walter holds her close kisses her and brandons mercedes speeds into the city
big breasts g strings testosterone
brandon in a booth with a topless black girl
we can see from his moves its the million dollar man talking
he whispers something to her
she reaches for her top as he grabs the hand of her topless friend and darkness
a light goes on illuminates a cave like bedroom
music from the club rumbles through the space reduced to a driving bass beat
the asian girl pulls an outrageous wad of cash from brandons pocket tosses it confetti like in the air as brandon the asian girl and the black girl fall on
the gold lame sheets
clothes are peeled off money sticking to their bodies girls clawing the cash from brandons skin black girl kissing his neck hands roving whats it feel like to do what
to win like that
brandon flips her over leans in from behind
its just like sex
you start by massaging the numbers very relaxed getting a feel see how they move
then theres a shift a plan forms and you connect to your teams
the girl moans reacting to something unseen sundays like penetration and the games have started and teams are scoring and youre inside and youre doing it and its doing you
feeling every shift every score every trickle of sweat the giving taking the long the short excitement growing bigger and bigger brandon cupping her breasts and its not an idea or part of you anymore it is you all of you and the crowds roaring and the clocks ticking and you know everything except how itll end and and then youve won over and over and over and its like one big huge insane weekend long orgasm
totally turned on kissing him nice job description
brandon presses her below frame naked asian girl climbing on top as the sound of applause is heard building in volume and salesmen stand on their desks clapping as brandon
passes through on the way to his office
only its john anthony whos strutting through the room high fiving salesmen kissing the girls a tanned tailored magnetic presence and walter waits within standing at the window overlooking the
sales room as brandon enters
know what time it is
glance at his watch yeah its wrong

brandon rummaging a closet produces a set of golf clubs

watches tonis legs swing into brandons sports car and brandon speeds fast down a street

brandon pulls up outside her shop
toni regards him

stepping from the car thanks for the ride john
toni enters her shop and eight football games are winding down another four starting
favor one of the tv screens
a network sports update
chris berman motor mouthing a one minute list of results
big loss for washington going down in miami
saint louis upsets k
and another sunday surprise philly trounces pittsburgh
chris berman continues with the scores as a pencil runs down brandons betting sheet checking off results loss loss loss loss loss the pencil pauses suddenly snaps from the pressure
of the persons hand and walter stares at brandon seated on the sofa watching the tvs
its obvious theyre getting killed
im gonna go work out
youre watching every game
every second of every minute of every game
dont even think of leaving
all but one tv is dark
the last game ends and a remote control suddenly shatters the screen
walter paces the office
brandon still on the sofa
no one else in the room
a wall clock reads am
walter picks up brandons betting sheet holds it like a dead fish
how do you go and

brandon sits at the end of the rail empty glasses lined before him watching a wall tv with the sound off
monday night footballs on
his glazed expression suggests its been a long three hours
patrons around him socialize laugh enjoy the bars oasis like vibe
but for brandon its just him and the game as a girl approaches big smile
oh my god brandon
brandon glances up quickly goes back to watching the game
girl oh come on i know you remember two weeks ago aqua im heather

pov brandon flurry of action on the tv
brandon lasered on the screen
leaning in laughing earth to brandon youre blowing it
the bartender steps in front of the tv to deliver her drink brandon jumps from his seat so he can see flurry of action on the screen the game ends
the final score flashes and pounding the bar heather taken aback pulls away
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
heather quickly leaves
other patrons react
brandon in his own world of pain
bartender eyeing him now
brandon throws down the rest of his drink trying to steady himself
his beeper suddenly sounds
he looks and walters name scrolls across the screen
brandon wipes the sweat from his brow
trying to understand
brandons cell phone rings
he checks the number picks up denny
hey yeah im in a bar

pacing the rail all right listen

ive got next weekend wired
ill win it all back for you and more
now ill call you friday with who to take
its all gonna work out
i gotta go talk to you later
brandon hangs up
strides out of the bar and brandons a man absorbed
the office is filled with sports pages from every newspaper in the country
brandon studying everything and a dozen rapid fire kick offs fill the screen receivers catch passes others drop them spectacularly running backs brilliantly juke tackles score quarterbacks are slammed from
behind stripped of the ball kicks miss goal posts by inches players are carried off on stretchers footballs sail through receiverss hands their fingers clawing empty air scoreboards blink outcomes stadium lights flare and similar lights illuminate a driving range on the hudson river
brandon smacks one to the sign about to hit another and helluva swing
sport of kings right
or is that horse racing
what are you doing here
southie told me where you were
i had to get out
clear my head
teeing one up well talk to me

brandon smacks a drive watches it soar youre right nothing compared to how much we lost today
whatd i go
i have an idea
i give you a few glimpses of what happened here today and you take a stab
just give me the numbers walter
you dont like that game
woulda been fun
grown men crying on the phone
wives screaming in the background
three salespeople quit cause they couldnt take the pressure
when you lose out of fuck doesnt quite cover it
what would be more appropriate is something like holy fucking shit
or my fucking god
or jesus fucking christ
i get the idea walter
i mean for on our biggest volume weekend what the hells left to say
except maybe keep the phone number and switch it over to a fucking suicide hotline
brandon hefts the golf bag walks away
yelling after him tomorrow morning brandon
bright and early
we start in all over again
no getting off
im gonna ride you until youre more sick of me than losing
turn it around and we avoid a lot of pain
omit omit omit gloomy fog
a few people heading home from work
brandon riding his bike pedaling fast when a man suddenly steps out flash of something in his hand jamming it in the spokes and brandon wipes out over the handlebars
hard to the ground son of a bitch
what the fuck mr
novian wants to see you
seeing a gun in his waistband tell him to call

brandon looks sees novian nearby
i didnt recognize you without the suit john

the bodyguard grabs his arm

oh im not using you again
thats already decided
and i cant get my money back

the bodyguard holds him tight
no one around

novian closes the distance between them

novian inches from brandon
unbuttons his coat
sound of a zipper
brandon glances down sees novian reach into his fly
the bodyguard holds him
novian comes close
brandon struggles very unsure where this might be going and he squirms enduring something trickling water heard novian staring right at brandon finishes pissing on brandons leg
novian motions his bodyguard to let go and the men walk off
brandon stands there
alone in the gloom and walter brandon jerry and chuck at the desk waiting for the weekly taping to start
walter jots notes
jerry leans over
i scored you the new mikes walter
no wires to mess with

brandon watches as jerry gathers his things walks off
fuck him where he flosses
asshole doesnt understand im building an empire around you
finish the countdown we got a big weekend to get to
lets go chop chop
a budweiser commercial fills frame pull back to show brandon in bed under the covers peeking at the tv over a remote
the sports wrap up comes on scores flashing on the screen
no clue how he did until his phone rings
then his cell vibrates
brandon gets out of bed
buries the phone under the mattress
he turns off the cell but within seconds it starts vibrating again
brandon sinks into a corner
knock at the door
brandon doesnt move
another knock and intercut toni in the hall talking through the door its me brandon

its not a good time
what do you need
i need to talk to you its important
brandon lost doesnt answer

hell ride you into the ground

toni leans her head against the door exasperated spent and brandon suit and tie stands in the lobby of an apartment high rise speaks on a house phone
an unsmiling doorman watches nearby
alex its brandon
hey its been awhile but i never got your number that night
i was in the neighborhood so i thought id take a chance and stop by
the doorman stands at the entrance watches brandon wait
alex appears beautiful as the night brandon picked her up in the restaurant
her demeanor however is far from friendly as she exits the elevator
man you got a doberman for a doorman
what are you doing here
i came by to take you out for a late dinner and a couple of killer bottles of wine
well go back to that place where we met

you mean nothing to me
oh wait i take that back you meant bucks
your friend set it up
already heading back inside dont fucking bother me again
pale sunrise over the east river
brandon suit and tie walks through the silent empty room
brandon sits at his desk
staring out at the city
his phone rings
finally pressing speaker phone hello
intercut amir in payphone beside n
turnpike dawn amir dishevelled distraught im wiped out john
amir my business

brandon staring at the phone barely holding it together sees tammy standing there holding the days newspapers hearing the conversation on speaker
no words now huh
no more money to squeeze so you shut up
how do you fucking live with yourself
amir hangs up
tammy staring at him
face hardening fuck him if he cant take a joke
tammy puts the days newspapers on his desk leaves
brandon glances down something catches his eye
brandon pulls a newspaper from the pile finds himself staring at a full page ad for john anthony
copy advertising the million dollar man
and brandon paces the dim space
sits on the bench press
leans back on the board
he stares up at the weights
moves the weight pin to
and slowly starts to lift
a bad of sweat forms
brandon throws off the jacket
pulls off the tie
removes his shirt and shoes
he resumes lifting grim determination the weights rising over and over and over faster and faster and brandon t shirt and sweats approaches walters office bursts through the door i
know what the problem is
walter watches two men unload stacks of money from a briefcase pile them on his desk
ill come back later
were done here
you want a bite before you go
something to drink
the two men leave
walter lights a cigarette
who were they
we need a bat light or something you know a signal i can shoot up at the walter cond clouds and no matter where you are you can look up
and youll know i need you
maybe that would work
cause last night i mustve beeped you a hundred times
who were they
theyre from the salvation army
how the hell does someone go for
a fucking monkey tossing darts could do better
whats with the money walter
coming around the desk i have a plan
from now on we take your picks and reverse everything
like a twilight zone episode where everythings the opposite
you say black we go white
a is b
lose becomes win
staring at the pile of cash how much is that
sweeping the pile to the floor how much is what
oh that dollars
what happened to the two mill all the other money
i was carrying twice that in red ink before you showed up
the last few weeks i thought keep the pressure off
hell come around
climb out on his own
now i figure fuck it
time to turn on the lights
let him see the toilet hes drowning us all in
maybe thatll shake him up
so what do you want to know
i got three mortgages on this house im gambling again and to cover my losses i just got a loan from a guy who works out of a bar on
a th and broadway
all this everything you see around you is smoke and mirrors
i shoulda been a magician
whatd you say when you came in
you were in a good mood when you walked through the door and you said something
youre betting my picks
you went and
you were picking percent how could i fucking not
trouble is i bet heavy after you went a hundred percent and rode you right into the fucking toilet
one decent weekend and i would have been set for life
one decent weekend
brandon stares at him stunned
i know what the problem is
you came in with a big smile and said i know what the problem is
im brandon lang walter
brandons the one who played sports
brandons the one who can pick games
i lost touch with him myself
it wasnt an act man
i became john anthony
but hes not me
if i go back to being brandon you can pick again
all you gotta do is go back to being brandon
talk like brandon
eat like brandon
forget john anthony
burn the suits
its all my fault
i see that now
i pushed you into something you werent
i took the golden goose and tried to turn it into a duck
were winding down the season
theres only two games this weekend
two winners and two over unders
thats all we need
you crunch the numbers sprinkle in a little brandon magic we get the sales people burning up the phones and come monday we go four for four going into the
lets get something to eat

kneeling down stacking the cash the brandon thing
what am i thinking trying to get you to go out
what would brandon eat for lunch
peanut butter and jelly
on the floor helping him ill get something
you want anything shipped from home
no im fine
because its important
pressure doesnt help
god forgive me youre an artist
i fucked with that
two little winners and a couple of over unders
thats all we need
you could phone it in
not for you
not for brandon
isnt that right
looks down at walter unable to hide the desperation behind his frozen smile and montage of brandon working through the week brandon closes the blinds in his office blocks the
view brandon works out watching espn the sales staff sit idle at their desks playing cards a pick sheet fills frame shows new york versus atlanta tenessee versus kansas city and an over under beneath each game walter waits in the sales room edgy pacing when brandon emerges holding the sheet all eyes on him walter approaches these are the winners
thats who i like
brandon made these picks
youre looking at him
regarding the picks to the room new york and the under tenessee and the under
sell em hard
sales staff crowd into the room
walter and brandon sit side by side
seconds before kickoff of the new york atlanta game
julia climbs into walters lap holding her puppy
julia can i watch daddy
i need you to root for me
pointing at atlanta theyre the bad guys
we want the blue team
they have to win by more than five points
and root for a low score
both teams have to make less than points total
new york and under points
why do we like the blue team
because brandon likes them
julia looks at brandon smiles
brandons barely holding up here forces himself to find a smile in return
the tv fills frame
new york kicks off
an atlanta receiver takes it back for a yard return
we start cutting from the game to brandon to walter the salespeople julia all reacting as the betting gods raise hopes one play dash them the next
play after play
tide going for new york one minute atlanta the next
tension in the room building
everyone crowds the tvs as new york defends a point lead with a minute left
points on the board
only an atlanta td can lose the two bets and theyre yards from scoring
a few high fives as atlanta fumbles on a run recover the ball for a five yard loss
backed up to their own end zone
two plays left
walter excited things going their way and brandon starting to breath again and atlanta tries a final hail mary ball coming down into a crowd time runs out as a
new york player swats it and an atlanta receiver pulls it down running hard open to the end zone the room freezes a new york player grabs hold trying to bring him the bastard down but the atlanta runner is strong and just makes it in for the score game over and atlanta hasnt won but theyve killed the point spread and pushed the game over nobody speaks the second game comes on right on the heels of the first and now tennessee is kicking off to kansas city and were on the roller coaster all over again sales people start drifting from the room and theyve pushed their clients huge on these games and their cell phones are ringing and walters just staring at the screens and brandons dying and walter and brandon alone in the room
sound of the announcers as atlanta get trounced by denver
not even close
well over total points scored
the game ends
all four bets lost
a commercial comes on
i cant do this anymore walter
i cant sleep at night
i cant eat
youre not gonna sit there and tell me youre ending this because you have a little indigestion or some insomnia
its a lot more than that
i made it very clear before we started what the stakes were
walter its over
what use could john anthony be to you now
only an idiot would follow him after the streak ive been on
hot streaks go cold cold streaks go hot
bettors will climb back aboard
they know you
and when your luck turns theyll remember you went percent for half the season
well make it all back on the last game and by next year theyll forget everything
who said anything about next year
sports bettings year round
im not doing this next year
you made a career choice
i bankrolled it
let him go walter
walter and brandon turn see toni at the door
of course you stick up for him
whos side are you on
i didnt realize i had to choose

i need you to tell me how to talk to my wife
when im talking youll shut your fucking toilet
to brandon leave
brandon comes down the hall
toni and walter heard yelling through the office door
brandon hesitates walks out and dim darkness
a distant siren bleeds in as brandon
his eyes open
walters face fills frame
what time is it
five in the morning

hand holding thing

because you can do this thing brandon

walter backs out kills the lights
darkness returns and brandon alone at a table sipping a sake when toni evening dress sits next to him
hey i didnt know you were coming
walter was delayed hes coming back in the morning
asked if id fill in
processing this thats funny he didnt call me

brandon after sundays game im taking off
a cab pulls up
brandon and toni emerge
brandon looks around as they start up the steps
both reach for their keys regard one another
its still early
come in for a while
i dont think so
she leans in to kiss him on the cheek and brandon suddenly shifts
their lips meet
a casual goodbye suddenly grows in intensity as neither tries to part
seconds ticking by
things getting heated
toni tries to pull away
brandon brandon comes close whispers something
he unlocks the door
she hesitates before brandon takes her hand leads her into his dark apartment and a cold wind blows off the river
whips through the cables of the span
a match flares
walters face is lit briefly by the flame
he stands on the bridge walkway looking down at the brownstone and gray winter day
view of a snow covered window sill walters face fills a shaky home video viewfinder video coming close to show walter opening a book size present removing a beautifully framed
photo of toni and julia
look at that
with the leaves and all
this goes on my desk
quick pan to toni sitting near the fireplace fire blazing
knock at the door julia vo ill get it
julia hands the camera to walter
video camera view of julia and the puppy running to the door opening it and brandon
walter vo there he is

toni stares into the camera as walter pans to brandon walter vo i saw something else i couldnt help myself

video camera back on brandon who do you thinkll win the big game
turn it off
walter still taping better yet dont say anything
well break it when we do the live show
take your time brandon
give walter a smile
walter zooms in brandon staring back at us and brandon loads up on newspapers and sports magazines and brandon surrounded by a sea of sports pages comentary ratings
he looks up at a blaring tv and the tv fills frame time cut as various sports shows come on back to back each providing a wealth of competing superbowl
predictions and analysis
camera tightens on the screen and we see for every hopped up sportscaster who picks denver an equally assured counterpart chooses new york
one after another
no consensus at all
airwaves awash in past season stats regular season stats post season stats all of it blending into an overwhelming mind numbing jarring blather of pure disagreement and brandon suit and
tie splashes water on his face stares at himself in the mirror
he pulls reams of stats and newspaper reports from his pocket regards the superbowl pick sheet
blank space for the winner
blank space for the over under
brandon fumbling with his sheets of data desperately searching for an answer when he suddenly hurls it all in the trash
kicks the can
kicks it again
seconds till we go live mr
brandon looks over
the unfinished pick sheet lies crumpled by the toilet
he smooths it
pulls a coin
heads new york
he flips the coin
brandon checks the box
brandon flips again lets the coin hit the floor watches it spin slowly come to a stop drop to its side and brandon sits at the set
looks over at chuck in his own world working something from his teeth
brandon slides the pick sheet to walter

loud and crowded

a big screen tv is set up in front

yelling toward the windows can we please get some air in here
brandon suit and tie looks through the glass at the feeding frenzy
he closes the blinds
goes to the closet
hangs up his jacket
removes his tie and kick off is seconds away
walter and the sales staff gather around the set turn up the sound
new york wins the toss and elects to receive
some bettor somewhere just made some money
no more calls
kill the phones
kill em now right now
the ringing stops
all eyes on game as the two teams line up for kick off
walter before the tv
laughing with salesmen
view across the hall into the office
brandon enters wearing his unlv jacket and faded jeans
to brandon re walter look at him
dead man walking should be getting last rites
hours away from losing everything but walter hes having the time of his life
maybe he thinks he already did lose everything
wall of tvs the balls kicked and the game begins the salesroom explodes in cheers after a good play players collide a fumble bounces across the field salesmen clamber atop
desks for a better view walter in agony after an interception a moment later elated when a flag brings the play back the score board fills frame new york trails at the half and pull back to show the tension level in the room is suddenly suspended
were in the eye of the storm
walter like a fighter between rounds
hold onto that coin you flipped
game keeps up like this ill have to borrow it
its not over yet walter
i wouldnt change my bet
brandon packs things into a duffel bag
the superbowls on tv
the sounds off
brandon removes the watch
sets it on a nightstand beside an envelope and the mercedes keys
picks up a plane ticket and brandon comes down the steps carrying his bag dressed the same as the day he came
brandon starts down the sidewalk
flags a cab
he opens the door about to get in when a cheer from the sales room makes him look up and pov brandon toni looks down from a window
she turns away
brandon climbs in the cab drives off and fourth quarter
superbowl blaring from the tv
new yorks driving
the sales staff are screaming at the set climbing over each other to get a better view and new york suddenly scores and the room erupts and walters right in
the middle of it looks around where the hells brandon
the doors ajar
walter rushes in
youre missing the game
were back in it
a new york touchdown and we win both bets
walter walks back to the bedroom
the tvs on
walter pauses to watch another play about to leave when he spies the rolex on the nightstand envelope beside it
walter picks up the letter
sees his name on the outside
he opens it reads
toni appears in the bg
and you didnt you tell me
he asked me not to
just like that
im sure its in the letter
im sure it is
i wonder whats not in here
what do you mean
what do you mean what do i mean
when it comes to brandon you seem to have all the answers
he had enough
he wanted his life back
he said that to you
yeah loud and clear by leaving
i think its something else
yeah tell me
on the tv
new yorks driving
game reaching a head
a clock in the corner counts down the final two minutes
you have no idea huh
youre missing the game
no im not
this is the game
brandon travels down an escalator and toni at the door
something was bothering him
i mean sure maybe he was homesick
or i was thinking maybe he had such you know deep feelings for me he couldnt face saying goodbye
what a minute
i just thought of something
just came to me
out of the blue
what about this
maybe brandon left without telling me because full volume in her face you let him fuck you
a new york receiver catches a long bomb
nailed at the
clock down to a minute
no time to huddle and do you deny it
do i have to
i know you did
another lock of the year
i saw you toni
i saw you go into his room that night
i never went to vegas
brandon walks through frame
passengers rush for flights and toni and walter in the middle of it you mean you lied to me about the trip
dont talk to me about lying
i guess you had the whole thing planned
dont make this about me
put me out there on a tray
yeah i put the tray out there but you didnt have to shove an apple in your mouth and jump on it
on new york throws a pass
seconds left admit it
you played me
youre damn right i did
brandon was right
son of a bitch
you dont deny it
best pick he ever made
what the hell are you talking about
passengers watch the superbowl on a tv over the bar
crowd of people around the set it looks like the last play and toni before walter
inches away you were gambling with me that night walter
brandon knew it
he told me he was sure you were watching somehow
so he asked me in to spend the night put on a show
i didnt believe him i mean after all weve been through but i figured what the hell
toni cond he slipped out the back didnt even stay here
you were in such a good mood the next day
i figured he must have been wrong
otherwise why wouldnt you confront us
close on tv
no time left
the new york quarterback drops back about to be sacked starts to run the rooms at fever pitch everyone screaming at the tv and walter still as a statue
game in the bg
toni rolling and now i find out youve been thinking ever since then that we did sleep together
living with it like that
looking at me like that
you sick fuck
you wanted to lose
you set us up
like i was something you just toss on the table
only we booked your bet walter
brandon and me
the two of us who evidentally love you more than you love yourself
your fantasys to end up alone with nothing
well i wont let that happen to you
i will never let that happen
this is it
were all we have walter
all were ever gonna have
you and me were all thats real
walter stands there staring at her
tears streaming down his face and camera on the tv
blaring the game
bar going crazy as the new york quarterback runs for the end zone
nearing the goal
a last second block clears a lane and the quarterback barrels by dives a hit a fumble on the goal line a beat a replay a referee signaling a touchdown
and the games over and new york has won but more importantly theyve covered the spread and brandon walks down the corridor his cell rings
answering its me
hey hey the big winner
whats going on
cmon i know its rough its supposed to be
a friend turned me on to the place
she said its the best
where are you headed
i dont know but i got an airport full of planes to choose from
does your mom know im in rehab
yeah i told her
great pick on new york
its like i always said you dont bet quarterbacks and receivers finishing his words you bet the offensive line
thats exactly what i was thinking about pop
excitement creeping in no kidding
helluva game huh
boy that opening drive was a beaut the way they drove like that six first downs you shoulda seen me brandon im screaming at the tv
brandon smiles as he listens to his dad talk
the loud sound of a jet taking off fills the terminal as brandon walks down the corridor and ext
elementary school playground day a dozen year old pee wee football players barely able to move in over sized gear are lined for practice
brandon coachs whistle faces them
were up against a tough team today toughest on our schedule
but youre ready for it
most important i want you to go out there and have some fun
keep it loose
because you cant make me any more proud of you than i already am
team cheer bring it in the kids gather close thrust their hands in the center thunderbirds
go get em
the kids scramble across the field other team seen suited and ready
parents on the sideline
one of brandons tiny teammates hangs back approaches brandon
you really think we can win today coach
id bet on it
brandon drapes an arm over the kid walks him to the game camera lifting higher and higher and thats it
