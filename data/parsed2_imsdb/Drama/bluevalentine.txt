he peeks inside the doghouse
theres no one home
dean moves to the fence

the dual mirrors multiply his reflection
he looks at himself and removes his coffee stained shirt
a neglected body
but something else distresses dean

he runs his hands through his hair looks in horror at twelve fallen hairs in his palm
he washes them down the drain and leans to the mirror inspecting his hairline

he places his hands on cindys hips and pulls her close to him
cindy hands him a bar of soap

his hands sculpt her body and move to her breasts
no longer washing her but molding her
cindy looks up
his hands move to her belly
he kneels down
cindy reaches down and lifts him up by the arms
but dean remains where he is
he begins on his knees to wash the entire surface of her left thigh knee calf foot
then he moves to her right foot and up her calf knee and thigh
cindy releases her breath
then deans hands move up between her legs
cindy grabs under his armpits
he refuses but she wins
she pivots them around again
standing in the stream of water cindy washes the soap off her body eyes closed head back
dean reaches for her and follows with his fingertips the flow of water down the front of her body
give me the soap
she forms a quick lather in her hands
she rubs it into his chest her strong hands making circles of suds

ice dumps into an ice bucket
music and laughter emanate from other rooms
dean wears a hotel robe and carries a full bucket of ice
he swipes his key
a teenage boy in a tuxedo shirt and swim trunks chases a girl in a bikini down the hallway behind him
we have neighbors
cindy stands in a towel at the bar waiting for the ice
she makes drinks vodka on the rocks
she hands dean his drink
why dont you put some music on dean
she pecks him on the cheek walks to the bedroom to change
he takes a big drink sifts through cassettes in his bag
in the bedroom cindy buttons up one of deans big flannel shirts
blue valentine official green script as of
she hears the music begin from the other room knows the song penny the quarters or dynamite four it sounds really good right now
drink in hand she begins to sway to the rhythm
dean peeks his head around the corner with a shit eating grin
he starts to awkwardly dance to the music and make his way down the hallway to the bedroom
its been years since they danced in front of each other and it makes them a little embarrassed to be doing it now
the closer they get to each other the less they can be seen the less they are exposed
soon they are slow dancing still holding drinks
they dont feel as vulnerable now
the cotton on deans robe feels good to cindys fingertips she traces invisible pictures on his back
dean burrows his nose into cindys neck inhales deeply
there is a knock at the door
they both wish it would go away
dean yells contd coming
something about this makes cindy laugh dean too
he backs away from her slowly as if pulled by some unseen force
the song continues as dean opens the door and pays the room service man
cindy sets the table
a torn and tattered teddy bear tied to the grill of the truck cuts through the early spring morning
i can tell whats happening already
you see this person
you think its love at first sight and the course of your life will be forever changed
dean straps a weight lifting belt around his waist
he lifts a tv on his back
cindy gives gramma a bath runs her hair under the faucet
blue valentine official green script as of
its like when two streams are flowin down opposite sides of the mountain mindin their business
a hand tucks sheets under grammas chin kisses her forehead
theyre doin fine until they hit the bottom and run into one another
bobby trains sit ups his abdomen taught
at that point they got no choice but to become one river
dean counts his pay opens his wallet packs it with bills
sure its a great feeling at first all this new water flowing together
but then you travel down a little ways and the land levels out
the current starts moving a little slower
papers are passed back
cindys reads great insight
she doesnt look happy though
she looks a little green
people start drinking the water
pissin in it
putting up dams to stop the flow
in the corner of the room bobby stares at cindy from behind
cindy pushes gramma francis up the driveway
bobby stands on the porch holding a bunch of red roses
cindy ignores it
in other words life interferes you know
blue valentine official green script as of a
cindy struggles to get gramma up the ramp of the porch
blue valentine official green script as of

the screen door closes between them

and theres not too many of these rivers thatll make it all the way to the ocean without splitting off eventually
its just nature thats all
curtis with harmonica and dean with ukulele eat hamburgers on their lunchbreak
and instead of thinking about it you gotta just do something about it
action not thought

dean peeks into jos office
she shakes her head no
dean leans near the window smoking looking out at the moon
i just keep replaying it in my head
thinking about other things i coulda done
other things i coulda said
cindy pours over textbooks but she is distracted
she opens her window and breathes in the night air
you wait your whole life for something to happen
blue valentine official green script as of a
cindy pukes in the toilet
blue valentine official green script as of
and you have all these ideas in your head about how youll act and what youll say and what youll do who youll be
she washes the taste out of her mouth and looks at herself in the mirror
she flicks water at her reflection
dean sweeps the bed of the truck
the broom catches something in the corner
dean reaches a locket
contd and then the opportunity comes it presents itself to you living and breathing in the flesh and you puss out
dean holds up the locket and stares at it twirling
he opens the latch sees a picture of the old man and his wife years ago
dean puts it in his pocket finishes sweeping up
still wearing his work clothes dean rides the train out of the city pulls out the locket
reads the inscription on the back you are my sunshine
dean gets off the train
asks some people for directions
a feeling of anticipation
dean pulls the lever his stop
dean walks to the old mans room
the door is open lights are off room is empty
all the furniture pictures gone just an empty bed
dean is at a loss for what to do
he hears the tv coming from across the hall
he knocks waits then opens cindys grammas door
she is lying in bed
tries to recognize dean
he pulls up a chair next to her
i was looking for your neighbor
the man who moved in last month
across the hall
do you know what happened to him
blue valentine official green script as of
he went out for groceries
what about the girl that was with you
the conversation moves in circles
not much information is gained
dean ends up just holding her hand
the bus drives away
inside dean stands
he is a little down
he feels around in his pocket
finds the locket
he puts it on
the bus comes to a stop
a few passengers get on
one of them is cindy
dean watches her pay her fare and move to the back of the bus without noticing him
she finds a seat pulls her hoodie low anonymous
she underlines passages from a textbook using a highlighter
dean is frozen
he gathers the courage to walk toward her
the moving bus throws his balance
he stands over her for a moment
cindy senses somebody in her space
she looks up
recognizes him but cant place it
i just had a long talk with your gramma
is that is that your gramma
cindy remembers him now hes just dressed nicer he doesnt look like a mover i was looking for that old guy who moved across the hall you know

blue valentine official green script as of

dean feels for the locket around his neck
he shakes his head
thats exactly what happened to my dog
my parents moved out of our house and three days later she was a goner
he pulls the locket out from behind his shirt
he unclasps it
shows her the pictures
he was so handsome wasnt he
i was trying to give it back to him
cindy looks at it
she was pretty too
dean thinks about the old man
the bus drives
she must have been crazy
why do you say that
cause theres one thing i know
the prettier a girl is the more nuts she is
i mean look at you

blue valentine official green script as of a

cindy thinks about it
just for a little bit
and when you dont want to walk with me no more then just speed up
doors to the bus open

they walk and talk about small towns and big cities school and work dreams and nightmares being old and being young etc
blue valentine official green script as of
wheres you house

dean looks back
he sees a bunch of houses that all look the same
they keep walking
ellipse cindy smokes one of deans cigarettes calls her dad on a pay phone and tells him she wont be home for dinner because she is studying
dean tells cindy about his childhood the sexualizing of his mother and his fascination with womens purses
it makes cindy a little uncomfortable
do you think it would be okay if i looked in your purse
cindy thinks about it for a moment
against her better judgement she hands over her bag
it weighs a lot
what you got in here

im trying to get into med school
blue valentine official green script as of

then he comes to a bottle of lotion
opens the cap sniffs
this is what you smell like
cindy nods i guess so
i wanna smell like you

dean nods applies a little lotion to his fingertips rubs it in circles on his hands applies it to his forearms neck face
he enjoys the feeling of it offers her some

this is what your lips smell like
they must smell good
he puts some on his lips
your lips must taste good

blue valentine official green script as of
where do you want to go
i mean if you could go anywhere
they walk to an old playground
cindy gets an idea
cindy runs to an old creaky merry go round jumps on
i used to love these things
i hate these things
dean is tentative but goes along with her
he starts slow but she eggs him to go faster
he runs in circles picking up speed until he is in a breathless circular sprint
he cant keep up with the centrifugal force
dean does as hes told
they both hold on for dear life
the world spins in a frenzy
the dread on deans face builds to insane laughter
it is super fun
her hair snaps in her face
then a look of sickness steals her smile away
she wants it to stop which slowly it does
she gets off first tries to walk but is too dizzy
she just keeps falling to the ground
dean crawls off the merry go round on all fours laughing
blue valentine official green script as of
what happened tough guy
make it stop
you gotta puke
its the only way
its the only way
it will make you feel better
dont be embarrassed
ill do it
he sticks his finger down his throat and forces himself to vomit
the sound of it is too much for her
side by side they puke into the gravel
they finish their business and end up on their backs and out of breath side by side looking up at the stars
they are both covered in sweat
we see their breath
im still spinning
maybe its just the earth thats spinning
birds begin to awaken and fly
you should come visit me in the city sometime
the morning air chills their bodies
dean takes off his jacket and uses it as a blanket
they get close together to get warm and watch the stars spin above them
the dining room table is set for two
a single champagne glass is raised
blue valentine official green script as of
they sit across from each other
cindy drinks premature

cindy starts to eat a spread of indian food and booze
how is it
how did frankie sound

cindy tries not to look disappointed

cindys confidence surges

blue valentine official green script as of

cindy lifts up her empty wine glass to the light
i think my glass has a hole in it
cindy cuts around her food and pushes a piece aside
whats wrong with that

dean stabs a piece of fat and pops it into his mouth
thats going straight to your tits

dean opens his shirt and peers down at his chest
i could still kick yer ass
blue valentine official green script as of
i bet you a nickel you cant even beat me at arm wrestling

cindy gulps more champagne
they scoot dishes out of the way and clasp hands in the middle of the table
im always ready baby
on the count of three
cindy flexes and starts
dean acting as if he isnt trying at all holds cindys hand at a stand still
cindy ignores his taunts and pushes as hard as she can
slowly she begins to push deans hand down
dean groans letting her win a little
cindy presses down with all her weight
his hand is centimeters from hitting the table
then he turns the tide
cindy battles back with all the strength she can muster
dean laughs realizing her passion for victory
dean pounds her hand into the table
he stands kisses his flexed bicep
cindy lifts her hand
a fork is stuck in the back of it
she looks at it with curiosity
blue valentine official green script as of
he plucks the fork from her hand leaving four vampire bites
ow ow ow
dean leads her to the kitchen holds her hand under the faucet
you think we should rush you to the hospital before you bleed to death
cindy shoots him a look
dean wraps her hand with a dishrag
does it hurt
it stings a little
dean tries to pick up cindy
she struggles against it
finally he cradles her like a squirming baby
put me down
dean huffs a little
cindy adjusts her weight self conscious
he hefts her down the hallway to the bedroom
dean awkwardly sets cindy down on the circular spaceship bed
wait wait wait
he flicks the switch and the bed starts spinning
he runs out of the room
cindy watches the room around her spin
dean returns with the vodka bottle and two shot glasses
he kneels above her and pours them two shots
blue valentine official green script as of
to numb the pain
im an anesthesiologist
she sits up
dean gulps his
cindy takes a sip
we havent gotten loaded together in years
he tops off her glass refills his own and quaffs it
i gotta take a piss
dont fall asleep
he kisses her on the forehead stumbles
cindy hears dean urinating
she is sickened by it
she tries to set her full glass on the floor that spins beneath her
the toilet flushes
the drink tips over
a loud crash comes from the bathroom
cindy sits up
what are you doing in there
an agonizing moan comes from down the hall
cindy staggers off the spinning bed and stumbles to the bathroom door
are you all right
she pushes the door but it is blocked
dean moans louder
cindy pushes again and inches it open
she sticks her head in sees him laying on his back looking up at the ceiling
i fell over
blue valentine official green script as of
come on get up
nope i want you to come here first
i want you to laugh
cindy opens the door and dean scoots making room for her
he lets out an ow before extending his hand
i want to hear you
i want to tell you
shh come here
cindy reluctantly joins him on the bathroom floor
their faces are close eyes locked
you want to hear a joke
whats better than winning a gold medal at the special olympics
not being retarded
cindy looks down
thats not funny
how come you dont think im funny any more
i tell you something funny
i see you laugh
but you dont really laugh so much
you dont laugh anymore cindy

no i want to make you laugh
tears well up in her eyes
dean rolls on top of her
he cups her face in his hands and stares long into her watery eyes
blue valentine official green script as of
no im just still in love with you
after a moment their lips meet in an awkward rejuvenation
she moves her head away and pats dean on the shoulder in a gesture of friendship
dean kisses her neck
you want to have another baby
i want another child
cindy bites her lip
he slides his hand between her legs
wait a second
she removes his hand and places it on her hip
dean continues to kiss her neck
he slides his hand up to her breasts
cindy turns her head in the other direction
she pushes his hand away
he brings it back aggressive
cindy squirms underneath him
he grabs her wrists and holds her arms over her head
his tongue licks cindy from her breasts to her face
she worms her arms away and grabs onto his hair
she arches her back looks at him through slit eyes
his pelvis pulses and he moans
he looks up at her over his brow into her desperate eyes
he springs up
sweat beads on his forehead
i cant have sex with my wife
cindy covers her face with her hand
do i repulse you that much
im good to you
im good to frankie
i deserve a little affection
do you want me to stop loving you
do you want me to fuck other women
do you want me to beat you
is that what you think you deserve
would that make it easier on you so you can treat me like this
cindy raises her hips and slips off her panties
she lifts the shirt up over her head positions her feet on the door jam
her arm falls over her eyes
breathless dean awkwardly moves one hand up and down her bodice
blue valentine official green script as of
he unbuckles his belt pushes his pants and underwear down to his knees holds himself in his hand
he lowers onto her
cindy adjusts her legs higher
he rotates his hips looks away in concentration
cindys arms move around him grabbing the small of his arching back
his pelvis humps in a feeble performance
a small moan
cindys eyes press closed harder
the erratic motion slows
deans raspy breathing
his weight covers cindy
she opens her eyes to the ceiling
she looks at him
his head faces away
she rolls out from underneath and stands
she wraps her dress around her and slips into the bedroom
back against the closed door cindy turns the lock
her eyes shift from despair to relief
her gaze grows more wild
the doorknob jiggles
a secret crazy laugh builds in cindy that she suppresses
dean presses his face into the bedroom door
he talks to her
on the other side of the door cindy listens
deans voice cracks
a wave of confusion backs cindy away from the door
she searches the room for an escape
there are no windows the only way out is through the locked door
trembling she wraps her arms around herself
she tries to make herself as small as possible
the spaceship bed is the only place where she can disappear
she crawls underneath the covers curls into a tight ball
sadness lets loose
cindys body pulses with faint painful tears
the black walls of the room twinkle with stars suspended in space
the cries get lost
drunk dean and cindy make out on the street corner
it is cold enough to see their breath
their hands caress each other feel what is underneath the layers of clothes
cindy makes a move
she unbuttons deans pea coat feels the shape of his chest his abdomen his back
are my hands cold
blue valentine official green script as of
dean follows suit reaching up under her jacket to touch the skin on her lower back
she recoils from the icy touch
you wanna go somewhere

they make out in the back of a cab
but the cab driver wont allow it
but they cant keep their hands off each other
they try not to get caught
the door to jakes room is cracked open and the tv is on
dean and cindy tiptoe in the apartment as quietly as they can
they cant keep their hands off each other
dean makes a bed for them on the couch where he sleeps straightening out a couple white sheets
they crawl under with clothes on

dean tiptoes over to jakes room
peeks in his door
returns to the couch where cindy is taking off her jacket
he crawls back under the sheet
dean whispers contd hes just watching tv
they start to make out while listening for jake

he throws off the sheet and goes into the bathroom touches the bristles of jakes tooth brush
cindy takes off her socks and waits for dean to return
blue valentine official green script as of
dean whispers contd its still dry
he gets back on the couch
their hands search each other under the blanket
clothing is removed and there is alot of movement but the details of what occurs under that single sheet remain largely a mystery
jakes bedroom door opens and jake walks out into the living room and into the kitchen
dean and cindy pantomime sleeping
they listen and hear jake opening the refrigerator pouring himself a bowl of cereal crunching
they feel like hes watching them
cindy tries her hardest not to laugh
jake stares at the trembling sheet with contempt before returning to his room
cindy releases her laugh
dean tries to shush her but he cant help laughing himself
hes gonna kill me
he already hates me
you think hes gonna go to sleep now
they hear jake changing channels in the other room
as quietly as possible they have sex under the sheet
a red plus sign bleeds onto the result area of a home pregnancy test
cindy sits on a toilet in a stall holding the positive test stick
a knock on the bathroom door
just a second
she wraps the test in toilet paper and buries it in the trash receptacle
a moment while the door swings closed
cindy opens the stall and confronts herself in the mirror
cindy writes a note to dean his business card sits next to an envelope

darkness disturbed by beeping

he touches the bristles of cindys toothbrush flicking up a spray of water
he walks to the kitchen and lights a cigarette
he coughs a little as he pours himself a cup of coffee
zaps it in the microwave
a plane cuts through the sky
dean stands in front of an empty parking space
he stares at where her car should be

he lights his cigarette on the stove
he hears the kids in the hallway
he opens the door and randy a hungover high school kid and amanda large chested short walk down the hallway arm and arm

dean rides in the back seat of a jeep cherokee wedged in between amanda and randy
billy and karina sit in the front seat
amanda offers dean a glass pipe

dean accepts the pipe and takes a monster toke holding it in until his face turns purple
cindy walks alone down the street from the train station
the front door squeaks open cindy slips in
glenda is passed out on the couch

bobby hits him again harder
troy and tony watch the door and egg bobby on

troy whistles sharp warning bobby that jo has just arrived
bobby kicks dean while hes down
dean is beat and bobby is running out of breath and strength
blue valentine official green script as of

bobby looks at his bloodied hands
he lacks the strength to lift he arms
gives one last weak kick into deans bloodied face
troy and tony pull bobby out
the gang leaves victorious yet somehow defeated
the office phone which has been ringing incessantly stops
dean is on the floor in the fetal position
it takes him a while but he manages to sit up
he feels the inside of his split lip with his tongue
he doesnt feel pain as much as he feels tingling and ringing all over
jo comes in
she freezes when she sees him
it takes dean a while to get up but he does
and it takes him a while to get to the office where his phone call awaits
once there he holds the receiver in his hand for a beat

he pulls back his fist and swings hitting the metal locker behind cindys head
he repeats the blows with thunderous rage
feinberg enters the room
what the hell is going on
dean turns and takes a blind swing at feinberg
one blow and feinberg reels against the metal lockers
he hits the ground with a thud
his nose gushes blood
dean paces around feinberg like a caged animal
he pulls down a locker with his hand
it crashes to the floor
cindy kneels over feinberg

cindy flips the lock
dean gets in the car
i want a divorce
she has emptied herself
her whole body is numb and it feels as if she is floating in space
anger overcomes dean
he hits the dashboard with concrete fists
he grabs the suitcase next to him and opens the door
he throws it through the air into a field trying rid himself of pain longing and desperation
he clutches his wedding ring but cant yank it off of his fat finger
finally he gets it off and tosses it into the field
the moment he releases it he wishes he hadnt
moments later dean and cindy search for the ring
it is lost
music begins to play in reverse
various scenes of the periera family together
all kinds of flowers
dean studies them
finds the ones he likes
and steals them
we follow dean from behind walking down the middle of the street
he holds the flowers
meanwhile we hear cindy asking her gramma questions about love and life
whats it like to be old
when did men stop looking at you
she confides her feelings for dean
the responses will be real responses a real conversation
cindy and gramma sit at the dinner table
the sound of boiling
steam rises out of the pots and pans
they continue their conversation

the heller family and dean sit around the table
jerry glenda and gramma bow their heads saying grace
come lord jesus be our guest and let thy gifts to us be blessed

dean follows obediently
cindy closes her door behind him
she begins gently kissing deans wounds

the faint sound of her parents fighting downstairs
shes going to struggle the rest of her goddamn life with that fucking loser
and thats okay with you
sit there on your fat ass dont do a goddamn thing

theyll stop soon
im going to miss my train
cindy goes over to her stereo and turns on some music low it is the same song that dean and cindy listened to in the moon room
it drowns out some of the fighting
she approaches him starts unbuttoning his shirt
promise me one thing

opens up his shirt
reveals a severely bruised torso
he winces a bit from the movement
she redresses his wounds nursing him back to health
she kisses his chest
dean starts getting underneath cindys clothes
he places his palm on her belly
i love you
i love you too
from here on out their actions increase with urgency
each moment that goes by makes them more and more desperate to feel the others skin
they are down to their underwear when they hear a door slam downstairs
are your parents gonna walk in on us
they never come in here
they make sweet love
the front door bursts open and frankie still in her leopard costume charges down the walkway
cindys car sits in the driveway
cindy gets out grabs her suitcase
jerry emerges from the house
cindy kneels down and hugs frankie
she is electricity in her arms

dean keeps his distance at the edge of the room
in the backyard frankie makes herself dizzy by twirling
jerry cranes his neck to look into the window of his house

fear strikes dean
he presses the base of his palms into his eyes rubbing until he sees stars

dean approaches her from behind
dean wears his baby blue tux
he looks himself up and down in the mirror
takes a deep breath
cindy flinches from deans touch
a look of terror in her eyes
dean hushes her
he leads her to a chair and sits her down
he kneels by her side and repeats her name
blue valentine official green script as of
he holds her hands and gropes her arms legs shoulders whatever she will let him touch
cindy has tears in her eyes but she is focused
there is nothing to say
dean takes a quarter places it in a gumball machine turns the crank
a plastic box rolls out
he takes it shakes it inside is a plastic ring
she takes a quarter and follows suit buying another plastic ring
in the kitchen frankie climbs in through the old dog door
she sees her father kneeling on the floor at her mothers feet
perplexed she pulls at her bottom lip with her finger
cindy releases herself from deans grip and goes to her suitcase
she carries it up the stairs
dean and cindy wait together in a room filled with other people about to get married
they observe these other people and create fictional narratives about them and their lives for each other
cindy opens the door and sets her suitcase on the dusty bed
the room is just like it used to be
dean is defeated
he sits back against the cupboards and hangs his head down low between his knees
frankie touches his shoulders
she gives him a massage
i want to stay at grampas house next time for fifty nights
dean looks up
he has tears in his eyes
frankie touches one as it streams down his face

dean stands and picks up frankie
he walks to cindy and hands her over
cindy and dean stare into each others eyes
the justice of the peace reads them their vows

dean walks out the front door where he passes jerry who stands on the porch
he moves across the lawn to the sidewalk
vermillion light falls in the sky
cindy sets frankie down and she runs out the door
jerry catches the little girl by the arm and holds her tight
dean walks toward the horizon
frankie screams contd daddy
dean stops and turns
cindy walks to the porch

he doesnt pick her up
from the porch cindy and jerry watch dean as he points to them
frankie doesnt move
dean yells for her to go back
