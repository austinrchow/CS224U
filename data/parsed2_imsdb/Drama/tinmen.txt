screen is black
in white letters we read bill babowsky bb a wiry dapper looking man in his mid thirties is circling a baby blue cadillac
a salesman follows on his heels
shes a beauty
looking at salesman who
whos the beauty
i thought maybe you saw some chick walking by
i lost my concentration
why do they call cars she
they never say he
the salesman shrugs his shoulders
bb walks around the cadillac
we hear yelling
nora a rather plain but attractive woman in her early s is yelling up the stairs
youre a sick man
do ya hear me
do ya hear me
peeking around the bannister from the second floor is ernest tilley also in his s handsome in a boyish way
who do ya think im screaming at
how many of you are there up there
theres only you and youre a sick human being
quietly coming down a few steps wheres my white on white shirt
the nice one you know
its like yelling through a wall to you
im carrying on about what a disgusting human being you are and all you want to know is where your white on white shirt is
yes the one with the permanent stays
bb is now sitting in a cubicle in the office with the salesman going over the contract on the car
now dont try to hustle me here you know what i mean
i hate being hustled
give me an honest price not one of your special deals
give me an honest price
do i make myself clear
now how much are you willing to pay
there ya go
there ya go
youre doing it
youre doing one of those hustle numbers
im just trying to get an idea how much youre willing to pay
i want to pay four dollars a month
thats not an honest answer
what do ya want to hear
that id love to pay three hundred and fifty a month
is that what you want to hear
tell me how much you want me to pay and ill tell you how much ill pay but dont do a hustle on me
i dont like that
how much do i want to pay
id like to pay nothing
tilleys leaving the house with his tie undone around his white on white shirt
he carries his sports jacket and nora is standing at the door yelling at him
youre being unreasonable
you dont even want to listen
i dont know what i did
i got no idea
if its my fault im sorry
i can do no better than that
a full unconditional apology
tilley walks down the steps of the house and goes to his car a cadillac
he gets inside starts the engine and pulls away
nora remains on the porch watching the car one lonely figure in a neighborhood of hundreds of duplicate houses
bb and the salesman are coming out of the office
if you even have the smallest problem call me personally and ill just shoot you straight into the service department
and i get a loaner if the cars got to stay
as we discussed you get a car if the car has to be kept overnight
i get a loaner
the salesman nods
he drives along mumbling to himself
shes gonna drive me to my grave
im headed to my grave
the womans driving me insane
its not supposed to happen this way
he starts moving his head stretching his neck from right to left
its not even eleven oclock and my neck is stiffening up
he juts his jaw out
my necks tight
bb gets into the shiny baby blue cadillac puts it in reverse and starts to back out of the car lot
tilley is doing neck exercises rolling his head from left to right as he drives
he sees a red light ahead and starts to slow down continuing to roll his head
bb sees the light is red and starts to back into the street
tilley rolls his head back as he slows to miles an hour
bb backs into the street thinking that tilleys car is going to stop
tilley is still rolling his head
tilleys cadillac and bbs cadillac crash into one another
the entire right rear of bbs shiny baby blue cadillac is smashed
both men are shocked and momen tarily confused
after a beat both tilley and bb bolt from their cars
tilley looks at his buckled hood
bb races up to tilleys face
are you a lunatic
cant you see im trying to back out of this lot
theres a red light you shoulda stopped
what are you crazy
you just want to back into the middle of the street like that
a mans just driving along and you back into the middle of the street
what kind of driving is that
what kind of driving
theres a red light im making a space for myself
thats what im doing in order to get into the street
thats something ya do
you came out of nowhere
you bolted out of no place
bolted out of nowhere
at six miles an hour im bolting into the street
he moves toward tilley
back away from me do ya hear me
back away from me
you want me to back away
ill back away
he turns to walk away from tilley walks and then turns back and kicks in the headlight of tilleys car
youre a fucking lunatic
he goes for bb jumps him and they both fall on to the trunk of bbs car
people have started to gather and immediately jump in and pull bb and tilley apart
youre a madman
smashes into me attacks me
the man is crazy
people continue to pull them apart
come on now calm down calm down
he holds bbs arms
another man grabs for tilley and tries to pull him off bb
take it easy
take it easy
to people watching get this guy
will ya get this guy
backs in front of me and then kicks my headlight in
and im crazy
tilley makes another jump for bb
again people try pulling them apart
youre going to prison
theyre going to give you death
bb looks at his brand new cadillac with the smashed in side
car only has one sixteenth of a mile and ive been hit
he turns back and looks at tilley
im gonna get even with you you son of a bitch
im gonna get even with you
this is no ordinary traffic accident
you want to drive a cadillac learn how to drive
you want to get even with somebody
you picked the wrong person to get even with
nobody backs into traffic smashes my car and says they want to get even
im gonna get even
seated at a booth are three aluminum siding salesmen having their late morning breakfast
sam pickles a heavyset man in his s delicately butters his toast and is shaking his head sadly
did ya see bonanza last night
can you tell me why ben cartwright had a colored guy stay over
gil who is pouring half a pound of sugar into his coffee looks up
ben cartwright had a colored guy stay overnight at the ponderosa
mouse who is picking his teeth with a matchbook squints at sam with an investigative look
did he know this guy personally
he was just passing through asked if he could stay over and ben cartwright said sure thing
it doesnt make any sense
he invites a strange colored guy in
invited him in to stay
is that crazy or what
if a colored guy came to my door and said can i stay the night id tell him get the fuck out of here
its nothing personal mind you
youre not a bigot is that what youre telling us
no im not a bigot
if youre not how come youre making such a big thing out of it
its the fact the ben cartwrights on the ponderosa
hes in the middle of nowhere
its not like hes living on reisterstown road with houses all around
were talking about the west here
its the idea that a strange guy comes to the door in the middle of the west
it doesnt make sense thats all im saying
youre a bigot thats what you are
listen ill sell tin to anybody i dont care who he is
a marks a mark whether hes chinese indian or from mars
im thoroughly integrated
makes no difference to me
i just wouldnt have one of those guys sleep in my house
tilley gets out of his car and enters the diner
he starts walking to the booth where the other tin men are
on his way he yells over to the waitress
florence eggs and the toast the way i like it
florence who doesnt have too much energy calls back to tilley
not too gooey
coffee right away
she trails the last word
sam is still talking about his problem with bonanza
i just dont believe that bonanza is an accurate description of the west
i say no more
tilley slips into the booth next to sam
he indicates for sam to give him more room
come on give me a couple of more inches
you want me to take my plate
ill eat in the parking lot
come on sam im having a terrible morning
youre not going to believe this some guy just crashed into me
right in the middle of the street
then he attacks me
one of the loonies
biting into his toast did ya live

he pulls a piece of paper from his pocket

florence comes over and puts down some coffee in front of tilley

gil still talking about bb
im telling you you just cant believe how well this guy does the marengay
i cant wait to see it
ill tell you one thing when i get a hold of this guy ill break both his legs and then he wont dance the marengay too good
we see bb pulling up to a building in his banged up brand new cadillac
there are three or four nice cadillacs parked outside of the run down building
the office is filled with second hand furniture mis matched desks and a conglomeration of styles
in one corner of the room there are two or three girls working the telephones canvassing talking to people on the phone to see if theyre interested in a demonstration
on the benefits of aluminum siding
they all speak in a very congenial tone of voice
good morning i represent the superior aluminum siding company
we will have a representative in your neighborhood today
would you be interested in seeing the benefits of our aluminum product
well we do aluminum siding which improves the appearance of your house and improves the insulation
which improves the appearance of your house and improves the insulation
superior aluminum siding company
we will have a representative
camera moves to another corner of the room where we see tin men salesmen sitting around one of the desks playing cards
moe is beginning to tell a joke
he is a man in his s
so the guy goes to the doctor for a physical
they do all those tests all that stuff blah blah blah
bb enters the scene and goes over and gets himself a cup of coffee
doctor says when we get all the information back well give you a call
leaves the doctor
one day the telephone rings
the guy goes and picks it up
immediately aggravated the guy
not the doctor
thats right the guy picks it up
he gets a phone call
its the doctor on the line
doctor says ive got some bad news and some worse news
bb join the tin men to listen to moes joke
guy says well let me hear the bad news first
the bad news is youve got twenty four hours to live
the guy says whats the worse news
doctor says i forgot to call you yesterday
they all laugh
looney a thin guy who twitches and blinks a lot stands up
i like it
i never heard bad news and worse news
i like it
its dumb but good
bb who is not laughing stands behind cheese who throws cents into the card game
up it fifty cents
im in on this one
we get it youre calling
im not sure
stay with him
i dont know
carly get out of the hand
im holding serious cards
very serious cards
if im lying im dying
moe throws his hand in too
to bb did you get the new cadillac
its already been hit
didnt have it five minutes backing out of the place and a guy comes out of nowhere and bangs into my car
so what ya got
cheese throws his hand down
pair of sixes
pair of sixes
about car how much damage
i bet its six hundred bucks
six hundred bucks
id get rid of the car
that much damage it wont be any good
you may have dented the frame
i didnt dent the frame
when you hit the frame the car doesnt ride right
he didnt hit the frame
ill tell you this im gonna get the son of a bitch
if he would have apologized or something but this guy gets out tries to push me around
youre kidding me
the guys totally off the wall
he takes a sip of his coffee
im gonna get him
just for the fun of it
bbs cadillac moves through the neighborhood and we see homes that all look to be about to years old
moe is with bb in the cadillac
bb is driving
moe is looking through some papers
now let me see
we gotta be at the hickey house at four
he looks at his watch its about three twenty now
weve got some time on our hands
you want to get some coffee
no im up to here with the coffee
he indicates his throat
they got any good pool halls around here
i dont know
beat you know what would be fun to do
lets try the life magazine routine
slightly run down
were looking through the lens of a mm camera
you know i think weve got to come over about two feet
the screen shakes as bb moves the camera
a housewife is looking through the curtains suspiciously
camera moves towards the window and we see moe and bb moving the mm camera around on a tripod
we can faintly hear their talk
i think this is a better position
the light is hitting it which is accentuating the effect were going for
its very good
in a creative pose this shows the flaws in the structure
bb and moe at the camera and tripod
under his breath to moe shes at the window
in a loud voice this is going to be terrific in life magazine
even louder terrific in life magazine
under his breath come on outside honey
in loud voice this should be our single biggest issue of life magazine
we see the housewife coming out of her front door
the housewife approaches bb and moe suspiciously
what are you doing
oh i hope were not disturbing you maam
were with life magazine
well be out of here in just a minute
still looking through camera to moe move the tripod another foot
moe moves the tripod
what do you mean life magazine
looking up from camera two minutes maam and well be out of here
we just need the picture for life magazine and well be out of here
i dont understand
its very simple
ya know were doing this layout about the benefits of aluminum siding a before and after kind of presentation
a before picture
so they see your house and another one done with aluminum siding
the other house looking so much more beautiful
in life magazine
its a special issue on home improvements and ways to beautify your home
a wonderful issue
its one of the finest pictorial things weve done here at life
the ways you can improve your house
he adjusts the camera were gonna be out of here in no time maam
its gonna look very good bb
my house is going to be the before
cant mine be like the after
weve got a house that looked like yours and its been done in aluminum
its very nice
really shows the contrast of what a house can look like
what does it cost
the aluminum siding
i dont know the figures offhand
do you have any idea moe
i think its fairly reasonable
could my house be the after in life magazine and you get another house for the before
you mean have your house as the after and find another house that looks like your house for the before
is it possible
what do ya think moe
would that be ethical
well we didnt sign any agreement with the after house
wed have to move very quickly maam
you know what i mean
youd have to work out an arrangement with an aluminum siding company and theyd have to do the job very quickly for us to make our deadline
weve got a deadline thats the problem
bb what do you think
can we slide the deadline or what
six or seven days
do you think we could manage it moe
its pushing it bb
to housewife what time would your husband be home cos hed have to go over the figures with the salesman
thats if theres a salesman available this evening
hell be home at seven
we might be able to work it
that would be wonderful
bb and moe are sitting on a sofa sipping coffee looking as if they were members of the family
the housewife and her husband are sitting across the dining room table from carly
carly is going through papers adding up figures
weve got a total of thirty seven hundred dollars
thirty seven hundred dollars
honey were gonna be in life magazine
to moe moe did you call the office and make sure we can hold up the issue until this job is completed
this house really could be a showcase
thirty seven hundred dollars
i tell you what
ive got an idea
do you mind my guys working on a saturday
cos if my crew can work on saturday next thatll free my guys up on monday
yeah thatll really help me out on another job
anyway if we can do that i think ill be able to knock off three hundred and fifty dollars from the job
you see ive got an overlapping situation on monday
i dont want to go into it
what do ya think
we got a deal
what are the benefits of aluminum siding
one you never have to paint
you have much greater insulation
it cuts down on your heating bills
so what weve got is efficiency and the beautification of your home
tilley is packing up his sample case
a middle aged husband and wife sit on a couch across from him
no im sorry mr
tilley i just cant afford it
we havent even got to discussing terms
there are so many friendly financial arrangements that would hardly be a bite into your weekly salary
not this time
well as i said you can always reach me
youve got my card and when the time comes lets talk
the husband and wife stand to show tilley to the door
hey give my best to your little son
wonderful kid there
whats his name again ronnie
well good night
sam is singing to the radio
tilley opens the back door and throws his sample case inside
he gets in the drivers seat and slams the car door angrily
i thought i had em
i was this close
he demonstrates with his fingers
the amount of time you spent there i thought you were ready to send for me to close it up
i thought i had em
tilley starts the car and pulls out
this is a piano bar with an intimate restaurant at one end
the pianist is playing the girl from ipanema
tall and tan and young and lovely the girl from ipanema goes walking and when she passes each one she passes goes
the last word of the verse ah has great emphasis put on it and is lengthened considerably
the people sitting around the piano all join the pianist and say ah in unison
camera moves over to a table where mouse sam tilley gil and a few other tin men set
wing the head of gibraltar aluminum a tall strong imposing figure holds court
the table is filled with papers folders etc
as if wings office desk had been trans ported to the bar
hes reviewing a paper from a job that mouse has done
forty six hundred dollars
this looks like a sound deal
they own their own house
we wont have any problem getting the financing for them
real good mouse
he picks up his check book ledger and writes out a check
writing so thats one thousand one hundred and thirty eight dollars
finishes writing check and hands it to mouse
pleasure doing business with ya
mouse takes the check and pockets it
wing turns to tilley and sam

wing changes amount of check and hands it to tilley
yelling to cocktail waitress honey can you get me some marlboros and a and
and some scotch straight up
tilley pockets the check
now listen guys we got a problem here
to mouse did she hear me say scotch straight up
my sources tell me this home improvement commission is for real
its no jackpot
these guys are going to be a real pain in the ass so any of the scams that you guys are pulling they get wind of it they take your
license and its goodbye to this business
they take away your license
they take away your livelihood
what kind of people are these
they have no respect for the working man
which scams are they talking about
they got a list
any irregularities you know selling a house on the pretense that its a model house and every job sold in the area they get a kickback
the life magazine hustle
you guys know all the bullshit numbers we can run
what a pain in the ass
do you think this commissions gonna stick around or is it gone with the wind
they take your license
bbs cadillac moves along the street
bb and moe are in the car driving along
i wouldnt mind seeing africa some time
i dont want to go where theyve got snakes
theyve got snakes
ive heard theyve got snakes thatll outrun a horse through the grass
they got a snake that bites you
you got eleven seconds to live
no thank you
i dont want to spend my good money to visit with that kind of jeopardy
id like to go to a place where
he hits the brakes suddenly
bb backs his car halfway up the street
he stops in the driveway of the pimlico hotel parking lot
the guy who ran into me
thats his car
he puts the car into park and opens the car door
ill be back moe
im gonna even the score
he gets out of the car quickly walks over to tilleys cadillac and with a swift kick he kicks the headlight that isnt already broken
tilley sam mouse and gil are about to leave the hotel
theyre putting their coats on just inside the closed door
tilley is halfway into his coat
to mouse give me eight points i take the knicks over the lakers for
its too big a spread
we hear the sound of breaking glass
tilley responds to the sound
he looks out of the glass doors and sees bb kicking in the headlight of his car
bb runs back towards his car
its that fucking lunatic again
he races out of the door of the hotel towards bbs car which pulls away and speeds down the street
several of the tin men run after tilley
he stands in the street watching the car disappear
still looking after the car can you believe this guy
is he sane or what
isnt that something
whats he got a gnat up his ass
what the hells wrong with the guy
dont you recognize him from the corral
i dont know the guy
ill never forget his marengay
ill tell you something if mr
marengay wants to play
of the porches of one row house on top of another
tilley is letting himself into his house
he goes into the kitchen where nora is sitting drinking a cup of coffee and working on a crossword puzzle
he takes off his coat and throws it on a chair
without looking up from the crossword puzzle look at you quarter to three and home already
you and the fellas run out of things to talk about
im out there working myself to the bone trying to make a living
he goes over to the refrigerator and gets himself some orange juice
whats a five letter word for a portuguese overseas province
m a c a o
whatre you doing up so late
were off tomorrow
i think this place may be a little too large for us
what are you talking about
this match box
its got a lot of overhead to it
what do you do
spend your time in the bedroom and the kitchen thats all
so why do you need a living room and a dining room
he walks over to the back door and looks out
why do ya need a back yard
youre not selling anything
im in a slump
last year im number three top seller
year before right up there
i cant get my momentum going this year
well you will
you always do
beat im not sure i like the idea of all this overhead breathing down my neck
when you have a place like this thats a lot of overhead
what are you talking about
the monthly payments on your cadillac are more than this whole house
why dont you get yourself something cheaper like a chevy
it doesnt instill confidence in my clients
cadillac means that youre dealing with someone of importance
beat i thought i had a couple tonight
they just slipped away
beat im gonna take a bath my necks been tight since this morning
ill turn out the lights
nora gets up and puts the cups in the sink gives a big sigh
tilley is in the tub lathering himself
nora enters and sits on the side of the tub
you know tilley we hardly ever do things together
do things together that are enjoyable
what would we do together for it to be enjoyable
if we went on a picnic
it would be fun
i dont understand a picnic
we just go some place
we put a thing on the ground and we eat
its nice to do that
i dont get it
its better sitting at home and watching tv
i think theres something nice about a picnic
whats fun about it
ants get into the food
i dont get it
we have to drive it takes maybe an hour to get there then you sit in grass and eat
why is that fun
i just thought it might be nice to do something together thats all
thought it might be fun
it doesnt sound like fun to me
you take the stuff youve got here in the house you take it someplace to eat it
its just as much fun eating in front of the tv and we do that together dont we
no ants and no bees
much more comfortable
its not the same thing
scrub my back will ya nora
nora picks up the back brush puts soap on it and starts scrubbing tilleys back
not too hard
beat dont get me wrong im willing to do anything with you
im just a little stymied by a picnic
if you want to go send me a postcard
nora drops the brush in the tub and walks out of the bathroom
what did i say
we see tilleys cadillac cruising the streets obviously looking for someone
tilley is driving with gil in the passenger seat
i think you make a left here
tilley turns the car
there it is
thats the place
thats it over there
as tilley pulls up we see bbs car parked outside of the building
here i come
he reaches into the backseat of the car and takes out a crowbar
hey tilley dont go too wild
ill show the son of a bitch
he gets out of the car crosses to bbs cadillac and smashes in the windshield and all of the windows of the car
as he smashes wildly hell get a lot of air
wont be too stuffy in this car when im finished
calling from tilleys cadillac quick tilley
lets get out of here
tilley runs back to his car and drives away
of a map of a block area of baltimore
colored pins are in place indicating various homes that have been provided with aluminum siding
another pin goes into place
that was a good sale double b
just got a call on a loan
were in business
we see bagel
hes a little guy with a black fedora and baggy pants held up with suspenders
bb stands with him
this whole section has been very fertile for us
moe looney and carly are talking to stanley franks a young guy in his early s
he is dressed in the ivy league look of the times
to stanley sure you wanna get into the tin game
moneys good i understand
lot of crazy people youre gonna run into when youre knocking on those doors
hermits that dont see the outside world jehovahs witnesses that try and sell you the bible at the same time youre trying to sell them tin
people that are just lonely and want to have conversations
every time you step in that door youve got to be fast on your feet
quizzing stanley whats the best way to qualify a mark
how do you know if you can get the upper hand
how do you know if youre dealing with a guy whos in an inferior position to you or superior position
how do you know
moe puts stanley on the defensive
you just have to talk and feel your way
get a book of matches out of your pocket to light your cigarette
you drop the matches on the floor
looks puzzled yeah
guy bends down to pick up the matches for you you got a mark
you got this guy in your pocket
if he looks to you to pick it up youve got a long hard tough sell on your hands
bb walks over to the guys having just poured himself some coffee
you want to get in good with these people
you want to win their confidence
good thing to try
get a five dollar bill take it out when the guys not looking drop it on the ground
guy looks back pick it up hand it to him and say mr
blah blah you musta dropped this five dollar bill on the ground
two things happen
he says its not mine you say musta been cos its certainly not mine or the guy takes it
right away this guy is thinking you must be one hell of a nice guy
you start chipping away
you start getting inside those people
stanley is quite taken by their information
bb puts his cup down and grabs his coat
come on moe lets split
to stanley yeah wed better go too
come on stanley
to carly who is hanging behind me and stanley
its like a first date
bb and moe approach bbs cadillac
he sees that all the windows have been smashed in
moe looks to bb
looney walks up from behind
you got a special bargain when you bought this car
they come cheaper without windows
bb reaches into the car and picks up a handful of broken glass
he tosses it up and down in his hands
this guys looking to play tit for tat
thats not my game
im gonna play hardball
bb throws the glass down on the ground
to looney quietly whats going on
looney just nods for them to go and they start to walk over to looneys cadillac
im gonna find out everything about this son of a bitch and then im gonna find the one thing that cuts him to the quick
lets go inside
make some calls
bb nods and they start back inside
of a pool ball ricocheting off an eight ball
the eight ball drops into the pocket
tilley throws down his pool stick
we see his partner is mouse
gil sits in a chair against a wall
i cant believe it
i cant believe i did that
well then believe it
theres no sense not to believe it because you did it
so believe it
thats twenty more
you owe me sixty
you think i cant add
he goes to rack to re set
mouse goes over and puts a nickel in the juke box
a record slips into position and harry belafontes banana boat song begins
mouse in unison with the record sings and is totally caught up in the song
da da da da day
daylight come and he wanna go home
he sings very loudly especially on the chorus
facetiously oh this is going to be good
da da da da da da da
he hits his pool cue on the ground for emphasis daylight come and he wanna go home
sam is going through some papers on a desk and comes across an irs letter addressed to tilley
he notices that it hasnt been opened
he looks at the postdate mark its five weeks old dated january
we can hear the banana boat song through the door with mouse screeching along with it
sam takes the letter and goes through the door to the pool hall
he approaches tilley whos just finished racking the balls
he nods for tilley to go over to him
they start to walk together through the darkened areas of the pool hall
found this on your desk while i was going over some papers
he hands the letter to tilley
from the irs
i never even remember seeing it
i must have left it with my other bills
i wonder what it is
maybe its a refund check
tilley opens the envelope and looks at the document
says here that they havent received my taxes
they seem to be saying that they didnt get my check for four thousand dollars
it must be a clerical error
i cant believe they spend all that time and energy to write to me
to single me out
what are you talking about
you didnt pay your taxes
i probably forgot
people forget their taxes all the time
just slipped my mind
i got so many things on my mind
i figured they could wait a few years
its not like they need my money to build a bomber
you think theyre waiting for my money before they dig a new road
are they all sitting there saying well its time we went to see that guy on pimlico road
cant run this government without his four thousand dollars
beat i figured theyd give me a little leeway
im going to pay them
i know ive got a debt
i just need a little leeway
you cant mess around with the government
why dont you go to h r block theyll take care of your taxes for you
you think im gonna let some schmuck know all my business

i need some privacy
taxes is serious stuff tilley
i can just see that schmuck in that little tax shop telling people my business
how much i make
how much i spend
all i can say is you better get a lawyer or somebody to look into this cos the irs they dont fuck around
just what i need in my life right now
im in a slump and ive got the irs on me
like when something goes wrong its like
he throws his arms up in the air in exasperation
we see nora leaving her house walking down the steps and getting into her car
she starts the engine and pulls away
camera holds for a moment and then into frame comes moes car with bb sitting shotgun
they follow nora
ten seconds later bb enters
he pulls a shopping cart from the stall and follows nora
as he walks up to the front of the supermarket and looks through the window
nora is stopped with her cart and is deciding on vege tables
bb has a pile of frozen dinners in his arms
to nora are these any good do ya know
these tv dinners
i dont think theyre too good for you not a lot of em anyway
she continues to choose her frozen foods
bb continues talking to her
my wife died
looking up oh im sorry to hear that
im over it now but it was a very trying time
ive only just started eating again
you know what would be a lot more healthy and satisfying is to get yourself a chicken
just pop it in the oven for a couple of hours with a little bit of seasoning on it
makes a good meal and you can make sandwiches with the leftovers
but then you have to sit and watch it cook
something seems sad about a man sitting alone in a house and watching a chicken cook
moe is looking through the window of the supermarket
from his pov we see bb and nora
bb says something and nora laughs
then nora says something and bb laughs holding her arm
hes an amazing sort
hes got the gift
a man sits behind the wheel of a plain looking ford
stanley the new tin man pulls up in his car behind him gets out and walks to the other mans car
he kneels down and talks to the driver of the car
there seems to be a serious exchange but with the sound of traffic and the cars passing through frame were un able to hear what is taking place
stanley nods taps the side of the car car drives off
stanley goes back to his car and drives off
tilley is selling to a man and his wife
the man wears a seersucker suit and a bow tie he is a mousie little man and his wife is the female equivalent
thank you mr
i cant believe it
this is the most generous thing anyones ever done swell
like a gift from heaven
the lord has certainly blessed us this evening
well what can i say
im a modest person
i just do what i can to help
he opens the door for tilley and tilley walks out
as the door closes behind tilley he goes to where sams car is parked and gets in the passenger seat
so whats the scoop
we got em
hes very excited
take a look at this sam
tilley shows him the written contract
written across the front of the contract in big bold black letters are the words this job is free
sam looks at tilley
are you fucking crazy
you just gave them forty two hundred dollars in aluminum siding free
smiles this is the best scam ive ever thought of in my whole life
he kisses his hands with wild smacking sounds
its in my blood
im brilliant im fucking brilliant
this is such a brilliant scam
im beside myself
what are you talking about
here it is
you go back in the house and this is what you say
tilley is crazy
he had a nervous breakdown
widen to include man and wife from before
hes been under a lot of pressure recently
he had a nervous breakdown
its the saddest thing ive ever seen
lets be honest about it nobody gives away forty two hundred dollars worth of aluminum siding free
i thought it was very generous but sometimes the lord moves in mysterious ways
let me tell you something when i go and see his boss and show him this contract hes out of this business
hell lose his home his wife and kids will be thrown out onto the street
hell probably spend some time in an institution so god knows what will happen to his wife and kids
anyway its not your problem
why do they have to be thrown out onto the street
you dont expect his boss to pick up the forty two hundred job do ya
yeah its a bad state of affairs
beat let me ask you something sir
you dont think theres some way you could work with me to try and resolve this do you
lets look at it this way what if i can sell you this job at a wholesale price
kind of lessens the burden
the big boss wont get so angry and maybe wont throw the guys wife and kids out
at least theyll have a roof over their heads
what kind of wholesale price are we talking about
you got a cup of coffee
ill get you a coffee
wont be a minute
lets just sit down and kick this around
the wife goes into the kitchen
calling to wife no hurry maam
the man turns to sit down and as he does so sam throws a bill on the ground
what you doing throwing your money around
he bends to pick up the note
i found a five dollar bill here by the side of the chair
the place is crowded
jumping with activity
a local band is playing on a tiny stage
bbs on the floor dancing with a girl
hes doing some good moves and its obvious that hes a real crowd pleaser
sitting at the bar are looney stanley and carly
the buzzard had a great gimmick
you know when it came time to measure a job hed cut the yardstick and reglue it together he took out seven inches so his square footage would always be
that way hed always make a few extra bucks on the job
stanley laughs and looks at carly
hed always put his hand over the break when he was measuring
nobody looks at a yardstick to see how long it is
laughs i never did that
i never did that
i was never very good in arts and crafts
i could never make the ruler come out right
the song ends
he pats his dancing partner on her rear she walks back to her table and bb walks over to where moe is sitting
bb picks up his beer can holds it up to moe as if hes going to make a toast
heres to nora
moe smiles picks up his can they tap their cans and both take a swig of their beers
stanley is really enjoying the stories carly and looney are telling
give me another story these stories are great
just a minute
ive got one
you know its like the faster you can start spiking a job the guy cant back out of the deal
shoe had some customers that he thought was fragile on coming for the buy
hed say to the guy here let me show you how bad a shape your house is in and hed rip off a piece of wood maybe fifteen feet wide
the guys house looks like shit so it makes it hard for him to back out of the deal when half the side of his house is missing
the shoes a fucking wonder
sam is driving and tilley is rubbing his hands together with excitement
a twenty seven hundred sale
this job is free
what a beaut
im out of the slump
tilleys riding high again tilleys back
we ought to go and celebrate
lets go to the corral and have a drink
we can turn the paperwork in a little later
gil says thats where marengay hangs out
gil keeps saying it
ive never seen him
laughing and hit ting the dashboard im riding high
twenty seven hundred dollars
this job is free
the man went insane
lost control of himself
his wife and children are out on the street
he laughs sometimes im brilliant
im fucking brilliant
i cant believe it
theyre looking at the girls sizing them up
pointing to a girl see that one if you were married to that one two weeks youd have to put your head out of the window for air
this one smothers
looking over to another girl that one is the kind that cant live without you
whiney voice where were you
when will you be home
i should get out of here
i told my wife id be home early tonight
its not even one oclock yet
beat how long you been married now
what is it
what do you think
is it worth it
why do you think
its hard to answer
beat seems better than if she wasnt there
quite a recommendation
cant wait to do it
tilley and sam come through the door and walk over to the bar
to sam scotch straight up
to barman scotch straight up and a rum and coke for me
he looks around the room at the women
looks like theres good action here tonight
what do you expect its half price night for divorced women
the place is hopping
look how much more complicated things are now
there used to be a time you met a girl you courted and then you got married and lived happily ever after
now see that one over there
he points to girl at a table thats helen armstrong
maiden name used to be tudor
get this she dated charlie rider when i was in high school seemed like they were together forever
they broke up she started to go with lenny mardigian they got married shes helen mardigian
that goes on two years
three years something like that
they divorce dates billy small for a couple of years lives with john isaacs for a year marries tommy selnini
that marriage goes in the toilet but fast
now shes dating charlie rider who was divorced by evelyn chartoff who used to be evelyn gage before that
beat he looks at moe and laughs so much for relationships
im beginning to believe in god
you were never one of those atheists were you
no im not saying that but im beginning to give god more thought
so what did you do
have some kind of religious experience
i tell ya
i took my wife for lunch yesterday
we went and had some smorgasbord and it kind of happened
you found god at the smorgasbord
sam people have religious experiences like on a lake or when they go up into the mountains that kind of thing
but i had mine in a smorgasbord
laughs sam youre too much
i went to get myself a salad and i started to see all these vegetables you know how they have all those salads laid out so that when its time
to get to the main course you wont eat too much
that scam to get you filled up so you dont eat too much chicken and beef and all that other stuff
i get the point
so i see celery i see the lettuce tomatoes cauliflower
and i think all these things come out of the ground
they just grow out of the ground
they had corn out of the ground
radish out of the ground
you say to yourself how can all these things come out of the ground
you know what im talking about
all these things are out of the ground
not understanding yeah
i mean how can that be
it just happened that way
and im not even getting into the fruits
im just dealing with vegetables right now
with all those things coming out of the earth there must be a god
looking at sam im not getting the same religious effect that came over you
i dont know why but i dont feel like running to a church to pray right this second
you gotta admit its amazing
he turns away and looks across the room i dont believe it
see the guy over there
he looks in the direction of bb
thats the son of a bitch who crsahed into my car
sam looks over to bb
bbs looking through the crowd and sees tilley
i dont believe it
banana head is here
that crazy guy that banged into my car and smashed my windows in
i dont fucking believe it
im gonna get him
im gonna get him
both bb and tilley weave their way through the crowd to get to one another
in the confusion of all the people they both go right past one another and then look around for one another
they see that theyre in the opposite direction and end up going towards one another again
moe and sam wander over to their guys
you got a lot of nerve banging into my car and youve got a lot of fucking nerve smashing my windows in
whatre you talking about
why would i want to break your windows
you didnt smash my windows in
im a hard working guy
i dont go around breaking windows
ive got better things to do
you didnt break my windows
you didnt break my windows
he pushes tilley
push me one more time and im gonna have to redefine your face
bb pushes him
tilley starts to go for bb and they scuffle about
moe and sam try to pull the guys apart
they move through the crowd to bb and moe
the band keeps playing
moe and sam with the help of looney and carly pull tilley and bb apart
come on lets go outside
lets settle this in the parking lot
youre not gonna get near my car
youre not gonna kick in my headlights again
beat what am i talking about
i didnt even drive tonight
you wanna duke it
they both head out the door
the other tin men follow and others who have been paying attention to this alter cation also follow
tilley and bb come out of the club and start to look for a place in the lot where theres some room to fight
the crowd eagerly follows right on the heels of bb and tilley
bb and tilley both take off their sports jackets
seeing the people gathering around what is this
what is this crowd here
were charging admission
give me some elbow room
bb and tilley both take up fighting stances and circle one another looking to take a shot
a police car pulls into the lot
the sound of the tires on the gravel catches moes attention and he sees its the police
quietly to bb and tilley police
tilley and bb immediately drop their guards and lean against a car
one cop gets out of the police car and heads into the club the other cop stays behind in the car
no one knows quite what to do since the policeman is so nearby
casually leaning against the car to bb youre a lucky man
the police showed
well see whos the lucky one
he picks up his coat and leaves with moe
with lit candles on it
the cake reads farewell ada
as it passes row upon row of secretaries typing in the social security office
all of a sudden everything goes black the typewriters stop and all we can see are the lit candles
we hear a huge chorus from all of the secretaries in the social security office surprise
lights go on again and we see a group of girls gathered around the cake placed on one of the desks
at the center of the group is ada in her late twenties and very pregnant
i never expected this
what a lovely cake
blow out the candles then
ada blows out the candles missing a couple and getting help from one of the other girls
nine candles for nine months
well miss you ada
youd better bring that baby in to visit us
register him for his social security number
a couple of girls hand around glasses of coca cola
nora stands in the midst of the girls pleased for ada
she yells out
i love ya ada and if youre smart you wont come back
the cake is being passed out and people are talking it has become somewhat of a party atmosphere
nora turns to her friend nellie
ive just decided
im going out with him
i have to
i just want to know what its like to be with someone else
she sips her coke
because if what ive got with tilley is as good as it gets i just
she shrugs her shoulders i gotta know
well how are you going to manage it
tilley doesnt get home until at least two in the morning
i hope you know what youre doing you speak to some guy at the frozen food section for five minutes you could jeopardize your whole marriage
everything ive done in my life has been safe and practical and wheres that gotten me
she lifts her paper cup well heres to who knows what
they touch their cups
this is a two story apartment in a renovated building
it has high ceilings and exposed brick
it is sparsely furnished but what there is is decent looking
we see nora and bb dancing closely in the shadows of the dark ened room
a frank sinatra record is playing on the record player in the b
it is in the wee small hours of the morning
a bottle of wine is on the coffee table
the remains of chinese food in containers are alongside
im still nervous
well i guess thats to be expected
you want me to take you home
no not right now
they dance quietly for a moment
every time i listen to sinatra i always remember when i used to work in atlantic city back in the late s
you know a busboy job
sinatra used to play at the club and we used to take our dates and say hey you wanna go and hear sinatra
then wed just lean on the door of the club in the alley and listen to the music
i think the girls were looking for something a bit more uptown
id go with you and lean against the door
they dance for a bit and look at one another
he leans toward her holds her tight and kisses her
then the record sticks on the words thats the time
thats the time
thats the time
bb slips off one of his loafers while still embracing nora kicks it so that it hits the side of the record table
the record slips a little and continues to play correctly
she looks at bb youve got a pretty good aim
i sure do
nora is sleeping in the bed bb slips a robe on looks at her and then goes down the stairs to the living room
he takes a piece of paper out of his jacket pocket on the back of a chair and dials a number on the telephone
telephone rings at the bar the barman picks it up
into phone yeah hes here
just a minute
the barman calls over to tilley who we see sitting at a table with some of the other tin men
hey tilley somebody wants ya on the phone
tilley gets up from the table and goes over to the phone
yeah this is tilley
bb on phone
heres the ultimate fuck you
i just poked your wife
tilley on phone
what are you talking about
bb on phone
shes in my bed right now with a big smile on her face
tilley on phone
well thats just fine by me
shes a pain in the ass
an albatross around my neck
youre welcome to her
and may you both rot in hell
tilley slams the phone down
bb puts the phone down looks puzzled
is this a setup
that son of a bitch
i bet he set me up
i thought i got him and he got me
that son of a bitch
tilley pulls up in his car in front of his house
he runs up the front steps
he opens the door flips on the lights and looks around
he races upstairs and starts rifling through the closet and drawers pulling out noras clothes her dresses skirts blouses and coats and he opens the window wide and throws them
he screams as he tosses underwear and the rest of her clothes
im a free man
im a free man
he grabs noras shoes and throws them out onto the street
then he goes into the bathroom and piles all of her toiletries in his arms tosses them into a trash can
takes a suitcase from a shelf in the bedroom opens it throws in the trash can
he clears out her underwear drawers and empties them into the suitcase closes the suitcase and then throws that out of the window
hes out of breath exhausted and sweating
he goes down stairs into the kitchen to get himself a drink
he sees a pair of noras slippers under the kitchen table he picks them up opens the back door and tosses them outside
locks the door
he stands there as if a motor is running inside of him
walks out of the kitchen
he exits the house gets into his car and drives away
tilley is driving
the same sinatra record in the wee small hours of the morning is playing on the car radio
tilley does his now familiar neck exercises to relieve tension
hes hard to read
a mixture of happiness and sadness
through the window of the diner we see tilley sitting alone at a table drinking a cup of coffee
the sinatra record in the wee small hours of the morning plays over this
nora is getting out of her car in front of her house
she starts to walk toward the house and stops as she sees her clothing shoes etc
scattered all over the lawn
she tries to take in the scene coats are lying on hedges underwear on the flower beds
quietly oh my god
she just stands there and tears run down her face
of noras back to the camera with all her possessions strewn over the front garden of her house
nora is standing at the door with her suitcase in hand
bb is at the door
he must have gone crazy
i dont know what happened to him
he must have found out i was with you
i dont know
i dont know what to do
she starts to cry
she goes to hug bb
can i stay with you for a day or two
bb puts his arms around nora
of a nearly empty pool hall
one guy plays alone in the far corner of the room
tilley comes down the stairs of the pool hall and starts to walk toward the back rooms camera follows him
he opens the door and goes through
camera continues to follow him into the offices of gibraltar aluminum siding company
we pass by three girls on telephones they are solicit ing jobs for the salesmen
camera goes from one girl to the other
hello this is gibraltar aluminum siding company were taking a survey
would you be interested in our field representative giving you a home demonstration
we will have some factory representatives in your area today as it happens
a voice calls out
let me see you
tilley walks over to the coffee machine
wing give me a minute to get a cup of coffee here
tilley passes sam on the way to the coffee machine
sam is looking through the sports page of the newspaper along with mouse and gil
what about super highway in the seventh
its paying to
ran well in its last race
gil looking at the newspaper
four in the fourth
i dont know
it just came to me number four in the fourth
looking at tilley number four in the fourth riders revenge to never been in the money
nice pick tilley
why dont you just throw the twenty dollars in the trash can right now
i like that name
ive gotta go and see wing
a little pissed off look we can be scientific from now to doomsday but we gotta be gutsy and go for the big one
tilley goes through the door into wings office
his office is equally messy and thrown together as everything else in the gibraltar offices
as tilley closes the door his coffee which is filled to the top of his cup spills over the top and starts to burn his hand
he jumps back and puts his coffee down on a desk and wipes his hand on the back of his jacket
whats up wing
wing is sitting at his desk which is cluttered with papers
you lost a sale tilley
the hudsons loan didnt go through
what do ya mean
they wouldnt clear the loan
hudsons some guy
hes got three outstanding shoplifting charges failure to pay child support from a previous marriage guys overdue on his mortgage overdue on his car loan and he was fired from
his last job for misappropriation of funds
whats wrong with this world
there are sick people out there
thievin son of a bitch like that takes up my time
cuts into the amount of hours i have available to deal with other people interested in my wares
theres no fucking sympathy for the working man in this country
they dont make our job easy tilley
lamenting wing it was such a beautiful thing
you shoulda seen how i worked
like a magician
this job is free
it was my best
theres no fucking justice in this world
there aint no justice
tilley goes to pick up his coffee off the desk
did you see the paper
take a look at this
he hands the newspaper to tilley
reading home improvement commission
hearings begin today
is this mccarthyism
what are they gonna see
if there are any communists
just cool down the scams okay tilley
tilley shrugs his shoulders
an area has been set up for hearings to take place
this seems to be a temporary headquarters until something sub stantial can be worked out
there are boxes and crates all over
theres a long table with a number of commis sioners behind it and a defense table a little way across the room
microphones are being used and the sound booms echoing off the walls
a small gallery of people are watching the proceedings
who is presiding over the hearings
even though he wears a tie and a vest he is nonetheless very sloppily dressed
to his left and right are two other home improvement commissioners
now when you made your initial sales pitch did you indicate that you would be giving free storm windows with the job
a typical aluminum sidings salesman in his early s
he leans into the microphone
free storm windows
that you would provide a free set of storm windows with the sale of aluminum siding
i wouldnt be able to make any money if i was giving away storm windows
my cost of a storm window is somewhere like
cutting him off the point being that you had no intention of giving away the storm windows
standing by the door at the back of the warehouse
the storm windows as i can recall was not an issue
i mentioned that i thought the storm windows would cut down on their heating bill and that they would obviously enhance the look of the house with the aluminum siding
work we were going to do
so you werent dangling a free set of storm windows as a come on to selling them the aluminum siding job
because it says here and im reading from a statement from mr
to bb what do ya make of all this
its the future moe
its the future
it was my understanding that the storm windows were included in the price of the sale
moe and bb are walking away from the warehouse toward bbs car
away from camera
where do you think theyre getting this information from
looks like any tin man gets in that hot seat then hes had it
then they can take your license forever
it dont seem fair
they walk by a volkswagen beetle car thats parked in front of bbs cadillac
bb stops and looks at it
boy i tell ya i bet you could sell a ton of these things
too silly looking
bb looks at the car for a few more seconds then goes to get into his car
ever see a dealership
they get in the car and drive off
as it bolts open and the horses charge out
sitting at a table
sam is studying the racing form tilley is studying the menu
i keep racking my brain
i gotta find a way to really get even with this guy
it isnt enough to wreck his car
even breaking into his house and messing it up or something that dont have enough impact
i mean the man poked my wife
i gotta come up with something ingenious
sam sees a waiter approaching and indicates to tilley to get off the subject
waiter arrives at their table
to tilley so what do ya think
i think ill take some meatloaf
writes on check meatloaf
no i think ill have some fish
fish doesnt fill you up
he closes the menu
so its meatloaf
to tilley what do you think sallys pride in the second
to waiter get me a bloody mary
to sam anything other than the bloody mary
to sam what number is sallys pride
to waiter no i dont like to eat until the third race
waiter walks off
putting his hand to his forehead six
beat im thinking one
then thats it im going with one
tilley this is insane
youre picking horses because you think youre clairvoyant or something
sam im not doing too well by checking the stats so why not
i put my hand to my forehead i see a one mr
motor in the second
they both look toward the track the horses race to the finish line
number nine streaks across the finish line
laughing i got it
i got it
he picks up the racing form
three to one
hundred and sixty smackers
laughs hand to the forehead
hand to the forehead
youre not exactly talking about a long shot
motor for instance is coming off at to
tilley taps his forehead with his eyes closed
third race i see a six
i see a three
i dont think the verdicts in on that one yet
tilley stands up and is going through his money and race tickets
wing paid a hundred on number five he loses i got hundred and forty

tilley heads towards the betting booths
wing enters near the booths tilley yells to him
hey wing were sitting just off the left of the entrance
im gonna lay down your bet right now
see you in a minute
you lost the first race in case you dont know
bbs cadillac is moving along the street
bb is behind the wheel moe is beside him in the passenger seat
i tell you something shes getting on my nerves
who else is it gonna be
who else is there
beat the whole idea of being with a girl on consecutive nights is new to me
its one thing when theyre with you for a night but when they live with ya its stretching the point
they got a lot of things they bring with them
you go to the bathroom you see things you never saw before
so whats the todo
well they move your stuff around and its not where it used to be
im not used to that
you mean all this time youve never lived with a girl
did we just meet
how long we been partners
no ive never lived with a girl
boy oh boy
did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today
yes i did
i came in last night she was sleeping on my side of the bed
in my life i never got out of bed on the left side
in my life never from the left
beat he looks out of the car window i got close once up in the catskills
i met this girl dorian
for a week we were together but it wasnt the same because she always went to her room to change and do all that stuff
she didnt have things in my room
bb gives a big sigh
all this cos im trying to get even with some guy
beat you know what
i think i got to see her and put an end to this
we see hundreds of secretaries typing away and clerks sitting at desks
bb walks into the office peeking his head around the corner feeling a little uncomfortable
he starts to walk around trying to find nora out of all the secretaries and clerks
she looks up from the typewriter and sees bb
in his thick overcoat huddled up he seems a little lost and its obvious that hes looking for someone
calling across to nora at the next desk is that him
looks up and and bb wandering around yes
she smiles and yells bill
bb turns towards nora
nora waves to him happily with a twinkle in her eye
bb feels conspicuous people are looking at him
he gives a little wave
nora gives bb a small kiss
im glad you stopped by
this is a real surprise
listen i got a problem
how can i help
realizing that she didnt quite get the point well the problem is
eh you know
youre the problem
quietly obviously really taken with him really
theres things that are bothering me
you know like things that come up
you know annoyances
hard to explain
as an example
i came home last night i get undressed and i realize youre sleeping on my side of the bed
ive always slept on that side
its something ive always done
then why didnt you just nudge me a bit and tell me to go and sleep on the other side
i didnt want to wake you up
i thought you might think it was kind of stupid or something
well thats easily changed
but there are other things
but i realize just talking about it they all sound petty and silly
listen if you think all of this is going too fast maybe i should move out
is that what you want bill
bb looks around very uncomfortable and he shrugs
i really care for you but if you think its best
beat i dont want to make you unhappy
after a long beat
i dont think weve got to take drastic action
thought id come by and get things off my chest
talk it out
beat listen im going over to pimlico
catch the seventh race
i cant get away from work
he goes to walk away then turns back and gives her a quick kiss
he turns and walks away
nora watches him as he walks by the rows and rows of secretaries and clerks
watching a race
very excited and animated were taking a thirty to one shot
come on number eight
come on you sucker
we see horse number eight in the lead coming around the home stretch
moe and bb are watching the race
tilley is still yelling for his horse sam and wing watch quietly
thirty to one
a hundred bucks on you number eight
theres a guy up here who put a hundred on ya
come on baby
come on baby
another horse number races past the winning post
quietly ive got myself a winner
tilley turns to look at wing
sam turns towards tilley looking concerned
we see the totals flashed on the board indicating that the winning horse pays
smiling way to go
moe tears up his ticket
should have bet with me moe
smiles very nice
that was your horse wing
you oughta know you bet her for me
wing goes to look at form
to tilley im gonna go with the favorite in this one fordnee lane
i tell you what i won sixteen plus on the other race from those winnings you can bet me eight hundred
i wanna bet eight hundred on fordnee lane
feeling uncom fortable fordnee lane eight hundred
sam is looking at tilley knowing that hes really in a jam
calling to waiter waiter can you get me a cup of coffee
tilley looks over to sam with panic on his face
wing turns back to tilley and sam
you guys want anything else
nods no er
i tell you i got a problem
what is it

laughing the sarcasms killing me
beat i thought you were looking to get even
whos your accountant mister cos i think youre down in the debit side
whos stuck with my wife
you or me
you want me to believe that you were setting me up with your wife as some kind of decoy
decoy is the word
theres a long beat as the two guys eye one another
then almost in a soft apologetic manner bb speaks
okay then you win
bb gets into his car
to sam that guy would never let me win
he must be setting me up
the son of a bitch is setting me up sam
for crying out loud why dont you just leave it at that
i couldnt have won
beat i smell a rat
bbs car pulls away
tilley and sam watch him go
bbs driving and moe is in the passenger seat
bb i think youre getting a little humility in your blood
if getting nora is part of losing thank god i didnt win
a temporary sign is posted on the door and a painter is filling in the name home improvement commission
this is the office of the home improvement commission
desks chairs and filing cabinets are all over the place not yet organized and boxes and cartons are stacked against a wall
angle on john masters walking with a file under his arm
he walks across the half empty warehouse where workers are renovating the space
he approaches a table where stanley is seated with his feet up nursing a hot cup of coffee
masters throws a file down on the table
this is good stan
fossey says it should go down very well with the city council
could help us appropriate more funds
this goes a long way to establish our credibility in what were trying to do
we hear a loud sawing noise and hammering echoing through the warehouse throughout this scene
theres a lot more where this came from
you know what i think you should do now
why dont you pull some files
some files that were completed others that went unsold and ill have somebody run it down talk to the customers and get some statements
pulling files is another thing
that might not be easy
to sneak a few here and there when you can
i think that might be good
bbs cadillac is parked in front of a house
what do you think if we made this one of our factory showcase houses
its a good location
get a lot of traffic on this street
bb and moe are selling to mr
shubner a young couple
the television is on in the background

i pick certain houses that are strategically located we put up the aluminum siding and for every referral for every person who sees this quality job that we do
sees how beautiful it is
i give you two hundred dollars
two hundred dollars

taking out his wallet alan this is how confident i feel that this house will drum up business for me
he peels off four hundred dollars and hands the money to shubner
four hundred dollars
im giving you commission on two house referrals before i put a panel on the side of your house
thats how confident i feel
you think that many people are going to
interrupting shubner im certain of it
im not giving away four hundred dollars for my health
im a businessman and im a good businessman
this is good business for me
im giving it away cos i believe in this house believe that it will refer me to other jobs which means money in my pocket which means money in your

yes but not a lot more
we hear further rapping on the window
i dont give a damn
its split five ways
to tilley your wifes knocking on the window here
tilley looks to the window acknowledges nora and points to the far end of the diner she nods and starts walking across the front of the diner to the door
nora and tilley are sitting alone at a table drinking coffee

florence walks over and pours coffee for tilley and nora then walks away

we see and hear the girls working the telephones as before
good afternoon this is superior aluminum siding
were going to have
a salesman in your area today
bb is sitting in a chair across from looney
beeb why dont you let stanley work with you
im off to florida at the end of the week for some sun and fun
let stanley work with you and when i get back well see how moes doing
i dont know
to be honest with you i think id rather work alone hes too green
is he a pain in the ass
he dont talk much hes a good listener so he cant really get on your nerves
hes a lousy pool player and he cant play cards for shit but
interrupting so what good is he
takes a lot of notes
smiles if this is a sales pitch i think you got to work a little harder cos i dont think youve got good product
as he comes out of the superior aluminum building and walks towards his car
we see nora driving her chevy in front of bbs car
she drives her car forward and then reverses it hard into bbs cadillac
he runs over to the drivers side of noras chevy
what are you crazy
nora drives the car forward and then backwards again almost running bb down
she rolls down the window auto matically so that she can yell
youre a goddamn tin man
then she backs the car up
bb tries to go around the front of the car
wait a minute
wait a minute
nora starts to move the car towards him
he moves away and her car smashes into the side of his car
she presses the button to the window and rolls it down just a shade
you wanted to win me just to get even with my husband
she rolls up the window floors the car and drives away
as he walks out of the building
he sees bbs car all smashed up
to bb i think you ought to get rid of this car
its bad luck
noras car screeches around the corner
is that the guy again
no its his wife
theres some kind of sickness that runs in that family
hes singing the banana boat song
da da da da day
daylight come and he wanna go home
at a table playing pool
mouse is standing next to his trusted jukebox belting out his favorite harry belafonte song
to gil why cant they get rid of that fucking record
its not a hit anymore
nobody cares about this song anymore
mouse continue singing in the background
da da da da day
we can always smash the juke box or break in and steal the record
lining up a shot hes getting on my nerves
the guy eats like an animal and sings like an asshole
maybe its me but im beginning to like it
tilley hits the ball and sinks the shot
happily yes sir
he comes out of the back room into the pool hall and walks over to the table where tilley and gil are playing pool
he drops an open envelope onto the pool table
to tilley take a look at this crap
theyre not gonna leave me alone
home improvement commission
with those words theres a genuine moment of concern from all of the tin men even mouse stops singing
tilley picks up the envelope and pulls out the letter
weve got to appear
i think thats the gist of what theyre saying
gil looks over tilleys shoulder at the letter
mouse comes over
cant we just ignore it
how do they know we got the letter
what do you think sam
i dont know what theyve got
why is this happening
am i paranoid or something
i mean why is this happening
the government is after me
the state is after me
marengay somebody is always after me
what the hells going on here
im just this guy
whats the big deal
they cant get along without me
the government cant operate unless theyve got tilleys money
the commissions after my job
this shits driving me insane
all the lying thieving stealing corporations in this world and the irs takes the time to come for me
theres billions of dollars out there but theyve got to come and get tilleys four thousand dollars
turning to mouse turn off the fucking belafonte song now or im gonna break the goddamn machine
bb is sitting at the bar getting drunk
stanley sits next to him
a girl approaches ruthie
come on beeb lets dance
not tonight ruthie my dancing shoes are on holiday
im more than sure
ruthie moves off
bb takes a shot of whiskey and downs it and then drinks some beer
who was the best you ever saw
best i ever saw
best tin man i ever saw
he holds up his shot glass towards the bartender and the bartender fills it up
those guys had good lines but they burned themselves out too fast
moes the best
the best there ever was
if hes in the door hes got a sale
the best closer ever
whats some of the hustles he used to pull
bb downs another shot glass of whisky
god damn nora
god damn nora
im trying to adjust
im putting up with things i never put up with in my life
i mean give me a break
give me a break woman
stanely wants to get back to the topic of best tin man
making light so what are a couple of things you and moe have done
still on the subject of nora it was getting to be real pleasant figure that
long beat more than pleasant
to hell with her
how come moes so good
why do you think huh
great man moe
bb holds out his glass again to the bartender who refills it
bb downs the shot and drinks more beer
i dont know why theyre so irrational
i think its because air gets inside em
beat she probably went back home to her husband
looks at his watch eleven thirty
he wouldnt be home yet
takes out a bill from his wallet this outght to cover it stanley
he puts the bill down on the bar and walks out of the club
sams cadillac moving along a row of houses
sam is driving the car tilley is in the passenger seat very drunk
they got no right
you know what im saying sam
theyve got no right
tilley takes a drink from a pint of whisky he has open
theyve got nothing concrete against us because if its just hearsay stuff its neither here nor there
looking around wheres my car
what happened to my car
its better i drop you off
yeah its better
tilley is in the bathroom washing his face in the sink trying to sober up
he lifts his head out of the water and bangs it on the faucet
he grabs his head in pain and then slides down the tiled wall to the floor
bbs cadillac pulls up in front of tilleys house
we see bb looking up and down the street with his head out of the car window
hes very drunk
he aint here
he gets out of the car and looks around the street some more
he stumbles up to a couple of parked cars look ing for noras car
he falls into some trash cans in front of the house
tilley is lying on the floor
his eyes open at the sound of the trash cans falling
he struggles to his feet and walks through the bedroom
we hear the sound of more
tilley goes to the bedroom window and looks out
he sees bb struggling to his feet surrounded by trash cans and garbage
i knew i could smell a rat
the son of a bitch is coming for me
the son of a bitch never wants to leave me alone
tilley walks over to the night table opens the drawer and pulls out a revolver
bb making his way up the front stairs to tilleys house
tilley makes his way down the stairs and creeps to the front door
quietly you want to rob my god damn house
im gonna make it easy for you
unlocks the door and leaves it ajar come and rob tilley
take everything hes got
bb knocks on the door
the door swings open
he waits a moment unsure as to what to do
tilley stands behind the door with the gun waiting
bb steps inside the house
before he can finish the word hello tilley hits him hard in the head with the butt of the gun
bb falls to the ground unconscious
then a light goes on and we see the in side of a refrigerator
pull back to reveal tilley at the refrigerator in the kitchen of his home
he is putting eggs and rotten tomatoes from the refrigerator into a bowl
he looks at a piece of celery but its so wilted and has no strength for his purpose that he throws it down
he picks up other vegetables but settles for the eggs and tomatoes
he closes the re frigerator door and makes his way to the living room
we see bb lying on the floor unconscious
tilley sits down across from him with the bowl in his lap
he watches bb
bb starts to come to
to bb youre a sick man
you smash my car you steal my wife and now you come to rob me
youre one demented human being
bb tries to focus on tilley
im going to call the police and send you to jail
but im going to humiliate you first
tilley throws an egg at bb and hits him in the head
bb is groggy and confused and still drunk
whatre you doing
what do ya want to break into my house for
this aint the fucking rockefeller mansion
there aint thirty eight television sets here
they aint saying nelson i think weve had a break in
count the sets to see how many weve got left
there aint tons of jewelry hanging out of drawers
it aint like i dont know which watch to put on i got so many
im a working man trying to make an honest living
what fucking morality you got asshole
tilley throws another egg at bb and hits him in the head again
egg yolk drips down bbs face
he tries to get off the floor but cant
youre the craziest human being on the face of this earth
tilley getting ready with another egg
what else do you want from me
ive got enough problems with the i
busting my balls and the home improvement commission bullshit to contend with
i dont need aggravation from you
still trying to get up wiping his face nobody does this to me and lives
throws an egg how do ya like your eggs
picks up a tomato side of tomatoes
he throws a tomato
youre going to rue the day you ran into my car
this aint the end
this is just the beginning
tilley throws another egg
a police officer is interrogating tilley behind the main desk of the police station
theres a lot of activity during this interaction
people coming and going
a guy breaks into my house and im being charged with assault
it makes no sense
with pencil and paper lets get it down right
the guy broke into your house you hit him in the head with a gun went to the refrigerator took out eggs and tomatoes and threw them at him
i was defending myself
he was stealing from me
it doesnt sound like defense to me
i wanted to humiliate the guy
here i am out busting my ass all day making a decent living i come home and some schmuck is trying to steal from me
so you hit him with a gun and pelted him with eggs and tomatoes
if i had some soup i would have thrown soup at him
is there any law you cant throw eggs
babowski claims he didnt break into your house
what did i do
invite him in so that i could throw eggs at him
babowski intended to break into your house but these circumstances of the guy being pelted with eggs and tomatoes is something we need to look into
tilley shrugs his shoulders
hes lucky that he didnt rob me last week cos then my wife was living at home and we had all kinds of things in the fridge
i could have thrown barley soup pumpkin pie candied yams
yeah he got off light
tilley and sam exit the building
seconds later bb and bagel come out of the police station
both pair of men head for their respective cadillacs
bb has egg stains all over his suit
to bagel i cant believe it the man throws eggs at me and now im gonna have breakfast with him
his partner says maybe the two of you can sit down and come to some kind of settlement
tilley is sitting in the drivers seat and sam is next to him
what am i supposed to say to him
the man has been a pain in the ass since the day he rammed into my car
just air your differences and well put an end to this
as they start to pull out of the parking lot
tilley sam bb and bagel are sitting at a table together looking at menus
looks up from his menu i tell you what
ill drop the charges against you and we can wipe the slate clean
i appreciate it
see how quickly you can clear it up
but i dont understand how the slate gets wiped clean when he breaks into my house and im the one charged
i told you i wasnt breaking into your house
i was looking for your wife
im too tired
the slates clean
the slates clean
the waitress approaches
what will you have
couple of eggs over some hash browns some toast toasted dark
butter on the side large grapefruit juice and some coffee
the waitress writes his order
on second thought instead of the eggs over if i ordered soft boiled eggs do you take them out of the shell or leave them in the shells
we can see that bb is getting a little irritable
we leave them in the shell
i dont like them that way because they get hot in the hand and its hard to scoop the stuff out
its not good
and you get little bits of shell in there and it doesnt taste good
why dont you just order some scrambled eggs and be done with it
if im going to order at least i ought to be content with my food
im getting a little hungry
ive got a headache as it is
just order some eggs so some other people can have something to eat before the lunch trade comes in
looks to sam why do i need a guy telling me what i should or shouldnt eat
this is not a four star restaurant were not having a gourmet meal
were ordering breakfast for christ sake
it so happens i havent been to this restaurant before
i dont know how they do their eggs
if theyre over easy and theyre gooey im not happy with it
and im not happy if the soft boiled eggs are left in the shell
to waitress cutting tilley off can i have some french toast and a cup of coffee
to bagel bagel what do you want
im ordering here
at least you can have the courtesy to let a man order his breakfast
to waitress ignoring tilley french toast and a cup of coffee
to sam sam this guy gets on my nerves
from day one
i knew it then and i know it now
tilley stands up from the table and starts to leave
im back to pressing charges against you
tilley turns and is face to face with bb
you want to play that way
this game aint over mister
it aint over
bb stands up
the waitress steps back and looks concerned
all right you want to finish it now
you want to finish it right now
im ready now
youre ready thats what youre saying
youre ready now
i have to be intimidated
i have to be brought here to be intimidated
i cant stand it any longer
youre driving me out of my mind
bb lunges for tilley across the table sam and bagel try to intervene the waitress doesnt know what to do
come on guys
take it easy
take it easy
get the people with the straitjackets
this man is out of control
tilley and bb pull at one another
were gonna finish it
were gonna finish it
bagel and sam pull them apart
to tilley come on lets get out of here
sam ushers tilley to the door
im not finished with him sam
to bb you heard me
im not finished with you mister
he storms out of the coffee shop with sam
bagel sits back looking relieved
bb composes himself
the waitress nervously stands by
to waitress so im having french toast and coffee
to bagel bagel
moe is in bed still hooked up to tubes
his breathing is deliberate and he seems weak
the camera slowly pans to bb who is sitting by moes side
moe when you decided to marry may how did you know
how did ya know
you mean to make up my mind to marry her
how did ya know
moe shrugs his shoulders as if he doesnt know
suddenly angry this nora is a pain in the ass moe
a pain in the ass
its worse now than when she used to be around
you wanna hear something
the other night at the corral club i turned down a dance
you turned down a dance
whats the odds on that
you think you can come up with odds on that one
hundred to one bb dont dance
a hundred to one against
theres a beat
im getting out of the business bb
ive got nothing for all this
lot of good times moe
a lot of good times but i cant live off the good times
beat you know my brother in law has offered me a job at hess shoes
i think maybe i should do it
you get there in the morning you come home at night

i get to be assistant manager
thats it moe
youre gonna spend the day measuring peoples feet
youre an e fit

beat moe youre the best tin man there ever was
nobodys a better closer
its over bb
bb looks at moe for a long beat
hes obviously greatly affected by this
so mays happy about this hess shoe thing heh
to say the least
sam is driving and tilley is in the passenger seat
you know when i saw bonanza the other day something occurred to me
theres those three guys living on the ponderosa and you never hear them say anything about wanting to get laid
you never hear hoss turn to little joe and say i had such a hard on when i woke up this morning
you know they never talk about broads nothing
ya never hear little joe say hey hoss i went into virginia city and saw a girl with the greatest ass i ever saw in my life
ya just see em walking around the ponderosa saying yes pa and wheres little joe
nothing about broads
i dont think im being too picky
at least once if they talked about getting horny
i dont care if youre living on the ponderosa or right here in baltimore guys talk about getting laid
beat im beginning to think that show doesnt have too much realism
what do you think tilley
sam i cant concentrate on bonanza shit
ive got too much on my brain what with that asshole and the home improvement commission i dont want to have to worry about whether little joe got laid last
beat lets go and eat something
yeah well go and have some lunch at the smorgasbord
tilley and sam are in line at the buffet
sam fills up his tray and moves off to the cashier
tilley hangs behind staring at all the food
he looks up to the ceiling
very quietly god if youre responsible for all the stuff down here maybe you got a moments attention for me
beat between the i
this home improvement commission and mr
marengay i got it up to here with this bullshit
to be frank with you im in the toilet here
if you can see your way
a woman with a tray starts to approach tilley
tilley turns to her
listen im praying here
i wanted to get some of the salad
its out of order
he signals for her to walk around him
the woman looks at him and moves down the line
looking up to ceiling do what you can all right
i appreciate it
tilley helps himself to some salad
the usual office activity
bb is at a desk
he picks up the phone and dials
nora tilley please
we hear a womans voice on the other end of the phone
what department is she with
shes with social security
which department is social security
shes there somewhere yeah on the third floor
shes got a desk towards the back
just a moment
in the b
stanley has gone over to a filing cabinet and is starting to look through the files
cheese wanders over to him
stanley can i help you look for something
no im just making myself busy
well i wouldnt do that
bagel dont like nobody looking at the files
hes still holding for nora
we hear a ring on the other end of the phone
nora this is bb
the phone goes dead
bb reluctantly puts the receiver down
the home improvement commission is in session
tilley and sam sit at the defense table
masters presides over the commission table where four or five other commis sioners sit
into microphone to tilley sam didnt you approach mr
boloshevski august while he was cutting his front lawn and tell him that his house had been selected as one of only homes in the state of maryland for a
free aluminum siding job
whats the name again
doesnt ring a bell
to sam sam does it ring a bell to you
leans into microphone it doesnt ring a bell to me either sir
didnt you suggest that for a nominal labor charge he would receive over five thousand dollars worth of aluminum siding
thats an awful lot for nothing
doesnt sound like good business to me
boloshevski was ultimately charged twenty four hundred dollars for labor which according to our figures is about the average cost of an aluminum siding job
leans into the microphone i dont get the point of this
twenty four hundred dollars that you charged for labor is the same as if mr
boloshevski had purchased the aluminum siding and had the labor done
maybe im missing the point here but if he paid twenty four hundred which is the cost of the job i cant see anything wrong with that
i dont know the guy but i dont quite get the problem
what were getting at here
what were trying to stress is that the job was sold under false terms
the man didnt win any award
he was not getting aluminum siding at a special price
a clear case of deception was involved here
to sam whats he talking about
the man got the job for twenty four hundred dollars and thats what it costs in aluminum siding
leans into microphone um
i dont know
we have no recollection of this particular job but i dont know if this is deception
look if you work in a clothing store some guy tries on a suit it looks like shit but you tell him it looks wonderful
the guys standing there looking like a sack of shit the salesman says what a great suit and the man buys it
thats deception as far as i can see but i dont understand the deceptiveness that you say were responsible for
if i make myself clear
leaning into the microphone id go along with that as well
what were trying to establish are the principles that have been laid down as part of the home improvement code of ethics
that you cannot mislead someone intentionally and i think thats the principle that applies to this
did somebody put a gun to this guys head and make him spend twenty four hundred dollars
i dont get the point here
i dont know the specifics of this case not being privy to all the information but all i can say is this guy got a fair price for a fair
another commissioner bud delaney takes the microphone
to tilley do you know mr
rayburn of aberdeen avenue essex
looks to sam and shrugs his shoulders then into mike i think youd have to familiarize me
the couple purchased twenty eight hundred dollars worth of aluminum siding and the two of you were the salesmen on record
they say and i quote here that they would have received one hundred and fifty dollars per home for every person in the neighborhood who saw their house and decided
to buy aluminum siding
looking up from paper is that true
it sounds right
are you aware that according to the home improvement code you are not allowed to exceed a twenty dollar limit in incentives
shrugs his shoulders we wanted to be a little more generous thats all
the couple said that they never did receive any money from any other jobs as you had promised
leaning into microphone we didnt get any leads from them
their house was not the showplace that we thought it would be
it didnt generate the activity that we had hoped
interrupting but should a referral turn up in the community wed be more than happy to give them twenty dollars instead of the hundred and fifty
leaning into microphone excuse us for one moment
he then leans over to delaney and they start to confer
tilley and sam watch wondering whats going on
masters leans in the other direction holding his hand over the microphone and he talks to the other commissioners
they nod in approval then masters leans back into the microphone
thank you very much gentlemen
should there be a reason in the future to call you back we would like to reserve that right
leans into microphone glad we could be of some service
tilley and sam get up from the table and walk out of the building
tilley and sam are walking toward tilleys car
rubbing his hands gleefully we beat em sam
we beat em
what a piece of cake
they aint got nothing on us
clean as a whistle
were clean as a whistle
i need a drink
i hate inquisitions
heavy rain is falling
nora with an umbrella walks quickly across the parking lot
suddenly bb slips under the umbrella with her
reacting sharply i dont want to see you anymore
she pulls away from bb and continues walking
bb walks behind her getting soaked in the rain
i gotta talk to you
i dont want to listen
give me a chance to explain
you owe me that much
nora still walking toward her car in the downpour
i dont owe you anything
bb lets her walk away
after a beat he yells out
it was a lousy thing to do okay
it was a lousy thing to use you to get back at your husband
but the fact is that i never would have met you otherwise
nora stops and turns to look at bb
more quietly it was lousy
it was a disgusting terrible thing
but a lot of good came out of it
what kind of a person would come up with such a devious thing
im not always a nice guy i admit that
i got a lot of training in deceit
its an occupational hazard
they stand looking at one another in the rain
id like to know what it is about me that i have to fall for tin men
what kind of character flaw do i have
i didnt want to have to come here
i wish that i didnt have to ever see you again
ive gone this far in my life without having to have this kind of thing happen to me
i was going through life sailing along pretty good
doing okay and i tried to get even with some crazy guy
and im here
the wet becomes you
gets rid of some of the slickness
i dont like the idea that im not in control of this but if this stuffs got to happen i guess ive got no choice
he gets angry i wanna be with ya
okay i said that
i said it okay
i wanna be with ya
it pisses the hell out of me and im gonna tell you that to your face but i want to be with you because
i miss you and id like to live with you
id like to marry you
and thats that
nora eyes him carefully
the rain falls on her umbrella and the rain beats on bbs head
after a long moment
i was hoping for something a little more romantic
a slight smile comes to bbs face
tilley and sam are sitting at the bar nursing a couple of drinks
in the b
the pianist is playing last night when we were young and a few people are sitting around the piano joining in with the song
ya know tilley we been working together for over a year
yeah must be about that
ive been thinking that sometimes a different combination makes for better luck
ya know what i mean
i mean maybe the two of us aint the right combination
im just getting used to ya sam
lets face it were not exactly setting the world on fire
its a slump
its a slump sam
maybe its a slump but like baseball some time they have to change the lineup to get the team going again
youre not serious about this are you sam
you wanna get another partner
you dont think im gonna pull out of this
i know youre gonna
i know youre gonna
look we beat the commission today you know we got a little bit of a victory
we split right now and maybe we can add to that
you know what im saying
change in the lineup
okay maybe itll help
maybe itll help
he drinks his whiskey you got any ideas for a new partner
well i had a conversation with solly shavitz so
maybe ill go with him
beat mouse is gonna need a new partner because dennis is going into used cars
he gets on my nerves
he eats too much
beat he holds up his whiskey glass heres to some pretty good times huh
looney looking tanned sits with stanley at the bar
bb and nora are dancing in the b
i dont get it
the broad smashes into his car and he takes her dancing
some kind of dating ritual that im not familiar with
bbs a pretty good tin man huh
mans what legends are made of
started selling pots and pans door to door at sixteen
nothing he cant sell
the song ends and bb walks nora back to the table they were sitting at
youre gonna come back and stay the night
all my things are back at nellies the other side of town
beat i know what i could do ill go back to the house
theres still a few things i left behind at least i can get a change of clothes
they both sit down
bb looks at nora
im glad this is working out
you really happy
you dont really show a great deal of exuberance
honey for me
im a parade
rattling a special padlock
pull back to reveal tilley at his front door trying to get in
camera pans to see noras car pulling up in front of the house
nora turns off the car lights and exits the car
she starts up the front walk and stops
they need my furniture
they got some living room somewhere in this country that needs to be furnished
theyre taking the furniture
the furniture the whole house
they locked it up
they confiscated it
yelling up to him on the porch what do you expect
you expect to get some preferential treatment youre some special case
youve got to pay your taxes just like everybody else has to pay their taxes
how many arguments did we used to have about filing your taxes
we had a lot of arguments
nora starts toward him
tilley sits on the steps
as she sits beside him theres a responsibility that youve got to have
its a long way from high school tilley
i was doing pretty good there for a while
doing pretty good
had my house had a wife a cadillac
i still got my cadillac
where are you gonna sleep
ill stay at sams for a couple of days until i get set up
beat whatre you doing here anyway
theres just a couple of things you didnt throw out of the house a couple of things i didnt find in the drawer
i dont know
i did a pretty good house cleaning number on you
listen about the divorce
do you want to file or should i file
i got to be frank with you this guy is nuts
he told me all about it
all about how you threw eggs at him
he told you it was about eggs
the guy tried to break into my house
he tried to steal things from me
he was trying to find me
we had an argument
i think youd be making a big mistake if you married him
its not for you to make decisions for me
i think maybe i should because i think youre being misled
i think youre confused
interrupting him i know what im doing
interrupting nora nora listen to me
i know about guys
cutting him off i appreciate your concern but its not for you
interrupting her but this guy is as bad a choice as you could make
youre a good one to give advice
youre sitting on the steps locked out of your house because you cant pay your taxes and youre going to give me advice on life
im not giving you a divorce and thats it
im looking out for your welfare
nora looks at him starts to say something then stands up and walks down the steps of the house toward her car
yelling to her its for your own benefit and youll thank me for it
nora turns toward tilley and suddenly snaps
you dont give a damn about me
you dont give a damn who i marry
the reason you dont want me to marry is because hes the one taking your wife and youve got your own problems with him
you dont care about me
its the same bullshit youre doing
thats what it always is with you tilley
its always you
took your house
you dont say anything about my things in the house
ive got things in the house i worked damn hard for and things that belonged to my family
the headboard that was given to me by aunt josephine its got to be at least a hundred years old
and the hand embroidered footstool
the hand embroidered footstool over by the tv
i dont remember seeing that
its been there forever
it was my grannys
its been there forever
ive never seen it
youve never seen it
youve never seen it
you put your feet on it to watch tv
the hand embroidered footstool
i dont know what youre talking about
i never put my feet up to watch tv
thats the way you are tilley it doesnt mean anything to you
you dont care if they take it all away
its all you tilley
thats the way its always been
she stands there for a moment then turns back to her car gets in slams the door and drives off
tilley stands on the front steps with a puzzled look on his face
hand embroidered footstool
he walks over to his car gets in and starts the engine
shaking his head in disbelief
bb drives up to the building in his cadillac the pas senger door opens and stanley gets out
thanks for the lift back bb
see ya around
stanley closes the car door and bb drives off
stanley watches bbs car turn the bend and then he goes toward the office door
stanley is standing at the filing cabinet going through files
he takes some files and puts them to one side
then satisfied that hes got everything he needs he picks up the files and turns to leave
bb is standing at the door watching him
you know something stanley i can always smell a guy whos not made of tin
he walks over to stanley
its against the law to steal files
i could call and have you arrested and sent to jail right now
ill put everything back nobodys the wiser
you work for the commission is that it
stan nods yes
doesnt the commission have enough information
they got to send out guys like you to spy
well we just started out and if we had some really good hard facts of some infractions it would give us a lot of credibility in the community
bb walks closer to stanley looks at him for a second grabs him by his tie and pushes him backwards
stanley crashes into the filing cabinet
you know what your big problem is stanley
if you want to find out stuff then you dig
you get on the phone
were from the home improvement commission
go find your leads
thats what we do all the time
youre just lazy stanley
if were doing something wrong you should collect all your evidence
instead you snoop around
what is this
you think youre breaking up some big drug ring
is this the mafia youve infiltrated
all youve got here is a bunch of guys selling tin for christ sake
beat you want some files
he walks over to the filing cabinet flips through some files and pulls out three files
stanley has gotten up from the floor
bb throws the files down on the desk
heres some jobs i did
leave moe out of this
he quit the business
stanley gathers up the files from the desk
go on get out of here
stanley starts for the door and turns back
why are you doing this
if its not gonna be you its gonna be somebody else
and if its not tonight its gonna be another time
stanley exits the office
bb picks up the files that stanley had taken out of the filing cabinet and starts to put them back
then he slams the filing drawers closed very hard
bb and nora are in bed together
maybe if i talked to him another day hell change his mind
i mean hes like that
one day hes this way and another day hes that way
you dont need to talk to him
i mean hes probably you know upset about the i
taking the house and all our stuff
after a beat
ever see a volkswagen
you know those little volkswagens
what does that mean
its a car
a little car
what does that have to do with anything
whats so interesting about a car
its a little thing
you know a little thing
guy tells me they dont even have radiators
theyre air cooled
i like it
wing is standing up at the blackboard chalking out schedules and sales
tilley stands back and looks at the board seeing his name up with mouse
to wing tilley and mouse
it looks weird doesnt it
looks very weird
lets hope you have some better luck with mouse
the pool hall is fairly unlit except for the slight shaft of light falling over several tables
gil is play ing pool with another tin man
mouse sam and three or four other tin men are playing pool
bb comes down the stairs into the pool hall
he stops playing pool
under his breath mr
he goes over to the office door opens it and yells to tilley
marengays out here
tilley comes out of the office and stands looking at bb
can i talk to you in private or do i have to talk to you over fourteen pool tables
tilley moves down the hall toward bb
weve got enough thats going down between the two of us but the fact of the matter is that i love your wife and i want to marry her
i dont care who she marries but i dont want her marrying you
why dont we just talk about this in a nice rational manner
youre going to be rational
weve got our problems but lets try and isolate this particular situation
i like this kind of talk
what the hell nonsense is that
what are you gonna gain from this thing here
now let me see here
ive got to isolate that for a moment and think it over
nobodys going to benefit from making me mad
you ought to hear yourself

you come in here you want to take my wife you want to isolate this situation
you want to be rational
ive got no tolerance for you mister
you know what im saying
what youre saying is you dont want to discuss this am i right
after a beat you like pool
the other tin men move closer to tilley and bb crowding in
i enjoy the game
why dont we play a little game of eight ball
if i lose i consent to the divorce
if you lose you give nora up
walk away from her
bb stares at tilley tilley eyes bb
quietly rack em
hitting the balls on the break
a seven ball drops into the pocket
camera pans to bb who has a smile on his face at the successful break he just made
he quickly moves around the table lines up a shot and sinks the ball
tilley looks a little concerned
bb moves around the table quickly confidently
he lines up another shot
he carefully strokes the pool cue between his fingers hits the ball and sinks the shot
he moves around the table he has a particularly complicated shot
the tin men react
bb hits the ball and sinks it
he quickly surveys the table and sees his next shot
he hits the ball it goes toward the pocket but bounces back slightly missing the pocket
tilley quickly goes to work
he sinks his first shot
he makes a difficult shot
tilley keeps moving around the table sinking one ball after the other
hes enthusiastic excited and confi dent
he sinks another ball and another
he sinks every ball then he eyes the eight ball for the coup de grace
trying to shake tilley you make this one here and you win
dont i know it
dont i know it
the eight ball heads for the pocket and doesnt make it
it hangs up on the felt about two feet from the pocket
bb quickly goes to work
sinks every one of his balls
he eyes the eight ball carefully
a couple of the tin men make private side bets whether the ball goes or doesnt
bb lines up the shot he shoots and it misses hanging up on the lip of the pocket
tilley quickly moves and sinks the eight ball
that puts an end to one of our differences
now concerning you
im gonna beat the crap out of you
you want it here or do you want it outside
bb turns his back on tilley to move toward the door
tilley swings with all his might and hits bb in the back of the head
bb almost falls to the ground
tilley goes to hit him again
bb hits him in the face knocking him back
tilley falls back
bb starts to move toward him
the tin men move in
stay out of this
this is between the two of us
bb gets to his feet
the two guys eye one another moving
bb quickly moves with incredible cat like speed with four hits into the stomach really fast and one hit to tilleys head
tilley falls into the rack of pool cues they all fall to the ground
bb goes to jump on tilley
he slips on one of the pool cues and falls to the ground
wing is standing watching the fight
he looks disgusted shakes his head
tilley moves toward bb
bb hits him hard in the stomach again
tilley keeps coming at bb
he rams him and knocks him to the ground
tilley pushes bbs head onto the ground trying to hit it against the floor
bb gets a hand free and hits tilley hard in the side of the head
the tin men have seen enough and jump in and pull tilley and bb apart
ad libs thats enough you guys come on break it up
bb and tilley stand up
bb brushes his suit down with his hand
i think our business is finished
tilley just stands watching bb
bb walks up the steps of the pool hall and exits
bb drives up to the front of the superior aluminum siding building
he stops the car and gets out
he is fairly disheveled and has a bruise on his cheek
he walks up to the entrance of the building
three or four girls are on the phones canvassing for sales
improves the insulation
well have a representative in your area
carly cheese and looney are sitting around a desk drink ing coffee
dannys an example of that
danny goes into a bar chicks lined up and down the bar
walks up to one and says honey would you like to fuck
shed slap him in the face
hed move down to the next girl say the same thing

then hed just keep moving down going from one girl to the other
fifteen maybe sixteen girls would tell him to get lost

bb enters says hi to the girls moves to get a coffee
call him names
but he doesnt take it personal you see he keeps going and then the next girl smiles
he says why dont you buy me a drink
he goes through a lot of girls takes a lot of slaps in the face but he never takes it personally
bb moves over to the guys
and he always gets what he wants
looney looks up and sees bbs face
what happened to you

i think you must enjoy these masochistic relationships
smashes your car

bagel walks out of his office and across to nick a tin man sitting at a desk across from looney
he hands nick a file
to bagel bagel you ought to get a load of this broad beebs messing with
looking over to bb looks a little too romantic for me
he walks back to his office

tilley drives into the parking lot of the pimlico he heads for a dark corner of the lot where about eight cars are parked
as hes about to park his car he sees wing talking to masters in the car next to his
tilleys a bit confused stays in his car watching them
after a couple of beats wing gets out of the car and heads for the pimlico
masters drives off
tilley gets out of his car and catches up to wing
hey wing isnt that the putz from the commission
points to car driving out of parking lot
what the hells he doing hanging around here
he wants information
i nailed his ass the other day wing

i was respectful courteous but i was slipping and sliding
they couldnt touch me
i got a real problem tilley

tilley and wing are sitting at a table
the pianist is playing and people are sitting around the piano joining in with the song

ive got my balls in a vice

jesus christ wing
im not gonna be able to work in this business
wing this was my chosen field
masters was gonna take this company apart
youre the low man on the totem pole tilley
theres a lot of guys earning a good living
no sense for it all to go up in smoke
you understand dont you tilley
its just business
listen tilley you owe me sixteen plus from the race and youre in for over two grand on the books so i tell you what
ill wipe the slate clean
he takes out his wallet from his pocket and peels off a few notes
heres a thou until you get yourself set up
i can do no better than that
looking at the money youd sell me out for a lousy three thousand dollars
three thousand dollars and i got to go down the toilet
jesus christ wing how long the two of us been busting our asses together jesus christ
we got some history to this relationship for christ sake
masters puts a little squeeze on you you just sell out
three thousand dollars
the bottom line is im running a business tilley
he peels off another couple of hundred dollars from his wallet heres another deuce
i carried you a long time tilley
ive done a damn sight more than a lot of other guys would have done for you
and i dont see no gratitude from you
he gets up to leave
you can finish up whenever you like
throws a few dollars on the table im sorry tilley
thats the way of the world
he pats tilley on the back and walks away
tilleys cadillac drives into the lot which overlooks the harbor
we see the harbor city lights surrounding the lot
the radio is playing
tilley stops the car turns off the lights but leaves the radio playing
he leans in to the back of the car and takes a pillow off the back seat
he props the cushion up against the passenger side and lies down looking up to the roof of the car
of the car sitting in the deserted lot
being fried in a frying pan on a stove
better hurry up everythings ready
eggs being slipped onto a plate with some bacon and hash browns
bb comes into the kitchen of his apartment
he is tying his tie
widen shot to include nora
i cant believe that youre up so early
this is a rare occasion
i just got some business downtown i gotta take care of
he stands there watching nora as she prepares the plates of food
toast will be ready in a second
coffees on the table
he continues to stand watching her shes not aware that hes watching her
she waits for the toast to pop up out of the toaster
er lied to you the other day
nora is still waiting for the toast looking inside the toaster to see if its getting brown
i went to see tilley about the divorce
she turns to look at him
he was not too agreeable and one thing led to another and we decided to shoot some pool to settle the matter
the toast pops up she ignores it
we played pool
if i won hed give you up if i lost id give you up
you played pool for me
nora i had no choice
its the most despicable thing ive ever heard in my life
i mean its disgusting
guys shooting pool to determine my future
nora i had no choice
beat hand me the toast
get the toast yourself
bb takes the toast out of the toaster
im just trying to be honest
its been on my mind
on my conscience
he picks up a plate
this plate yours or mine
why dont you take both
maybe you can choke to death on one of them
bb takes one of the plates and goes toward the table
nora watches him a beat amazed that he doesnt seem to recognize the seriousness of the situation
angry how can you be so
how can you not understand how wrong that is
i cant understand that mentality
shoot pool for me
bb dips his toast into his eggs
tilley is not the most rational man in this world
i tried to talk to him
he wouldnt listen
so what are my options
you know what im saying
what are my options
i cant believe you had to shoot pool
dont you understand that dont you understand how crazy that is
youre sitting there
youre eating your eggs as if its normal business in life here
like feudal lords or something you used to read about in history books
all right im sorry
he dips more toast into his eggs and eats
i blew the eight ball
what does that mean
it means im supposed to give you up and im never supposed to see you again
will you stop eating the eggs for a minute
how can you tell me things like this and casually eat your eggs
what does this mean bill
well im supposed to give you up as part of honoring that agreement but im not that honorable a guy
he smiles takes a quick sip of his coffee
i gotta go
why are you running off so fast here
i told you i got some business downtown
he gives her a kiss
starts to go turns back gives her another kiss more passionate this time
ill see you later
he goes down the hall to walk out the front door
nora walks behind him stands and watches him go out the door and down the front steps
he gets into his car and drives off
nora stands at the door watching the car drive away
tilley pulls his cadillac into a parking space just a little up the street from the tobacco warehouse which houses the home improvement commission
he gets out of his car locks the door and starts down the street
bbs car drives past tilley
camera follows bbs car as he pulls into a parking space close to the commission building
corridor off the main hearing room
the hearing is not yet in session
tilley sits on a bench against a wall
he glances up his eyes drop and then he looks across camera
camera pans to the opposite side of the corri dor where bb sits on another bench against a wall
bb glances off at tilley and then drops his eyes
camera pans back to tilley
a few beats go by
both men are uncomfortable with one anothers presence
finally to bb you gotta testify huh
you got a lawyer
i already testified once
i beat em before ill beat em again
beat you got a high priced mouthpiece to speak for ya
i dont need one
i dont expect to win
i gave them some pretty incriminating evidence
you gave them evidence
the only way i could think to get out of this business
points laughing hey thats good
thats good yeah
theres activity in the hallway
the hearing for the home improvement commission is now in session
to bb so
shes doin all right
a man comes out of the hearing room
turns to bb take good care of her
of the home improvement commission
five or six commissioners are behind a long table led by john masters there is a gallery of observers and tilley sits at the defense table across from the commissioners
into microphone are you aware that thats a violation of sections and
im not aware of the section numbers
sometimes you get a little overzealous in the heat of the sales pitch thats all
bb is watching the proceedings
camera holds on him
was it the heat of the sales pitch on february rd of this year that made you write across a contract this job is free
who is falling apart
as i remember no sale was made concerning those customers
it fell out because a loan couldnt be arranged but the people did agree in principle
beat the point that wed like to stress is that you misled these people
told them the job was free
then you sent in your closer with some cover story about how you had suffered a nervous breakdown and a sale was ultimately made for twenty three hundred and seventy
that is misleading and deceptive sales practice
it was temporary insanity
i dont know
it just came over me it might have been something i ate
i dont know
it was crazy im the first to admit it was a crazy thing to do
cutting him off we have other specific examples of deceptive sales practices on your behalf concerning a job carried out on december
you violated sections and
and concerning a job sold to mr
defranco on october violations of sections and took place
what are all these numbers here
im not familiar with all these section violations
who is watching the proceedings intently
it is the feeling of this commission that these infractions are severe violations of the home improvement laws and therefore constitute misuse of the license to sell aluminum siding as
approved by this state
it is the decision of this commission to revoke your license to sell aluminum siding
hes not very happy
which will prohibit you from practicing in the state of maryland
are you sure
maybe the guys want to think this over
thank you mr
you may hand over your license to the clerk of the commission on your way out
gets up from the table and goes to the back of the room to exit the building
he stops at a desk just inside the door where the clerk is sitting
tilley pulls out his wallet takes out a small document and throws it down on the desk
he exits the building
same as before except now we see stanley enter and sit amongst the observers
william babowski please come forward
bb walks over to the defense table and sits down
you have the right to have a lawyer present if you so wish
i do not wish
tilley walks down the street toward his car
suddenly he realizes that theres an empty space and his car is gone
tilleys a little confused thinking that perhaps he parked elsewhere
a young black kid walks up to tilley
did you have a car parked here
what about it
a man told me to say they took it
who took it
man said the tax man
gave me a dollar to tell you so
tilley walks over and stands in the empty space where his car had been
how low can you get
how low can you get
he walks around in the space as if somehow his car might reappear
he mumbles to himself
how can people come and take a mans car
the hearing is continuing with bb at the defense table and stanley watching
i think with the number of violations on your record mr
babowski this commission has no recourse but to revoke your state license
would you please drop off your license with the clerk of the commission on your way out
leaning into the microphone thank you
bb gets up and walks to the back of the room
he stops at the same desk as tilley but instead of going into his wallet like tilley he just reaches into his suit pocket pulls out a license document and
tosses it onto the table
then he heads out the door
bb walks down the street making for his car
he sees tilley still standing in the vacant parking space
tilley sees bb
sorry about your license
you in there
they got my license as well
sorry to hear it
what are you doing standing there
this is where my car used to be
thieving sons of bitches
bb looks at tilley for a beat
you need a ride uptown
i could use one
they cross the street and go toward bbs cadillac
bb gets in the drivers side tilley gets in the passenger side and the car pulls out
bbs driving and tilleys in the passenger seat
some bullshit commission huh
beat tell me wheres it written it the constitution that says you cant hustle for money
wheres it written
it aint like i went into an alley and hit a guy over the head with a brick and stole his money
not like i broke into somebodys house and stole his stuff
all im doing is selling
wheres the crime in that
i dont know what the worlds coming to
youre telling me
i dont know what the worlds coming to
bbs still driving and tilleys in the passenger seat
you know what our big crime is
were nickel and dime guys
were small time hustlers
they got us because were hustling nickels and dimes
nickels and dimes
you got a good point there bb
youre right on the money with that kind of thinking
bb stops the car at a stop sign
something catches bbs eye
through the windshield we see a volkswagen beetle going from right to left
as he watches the car
gotta find a new business to get into
very hard to find something new to get into
bb puts his foot on the gas and starts to drive
better put on my thinking cap
not easy to think of something new
showing stacks of houses as the cadillac drives away
a macdonald golden arch is being put in place by a crane on the horizon line
its almost as if its a rainbow across the far side of town and the cadillac will drive through it
believe me well find something
its just a matter of time
matter of time
you know i hear the new cadillacs gonna be out in a couple of months
theyre changing the body
i hear its a beaut
maybe i should put in my order now
whatre you talking about
you aint got a pot to piss in
give me the pot
ill fill it
