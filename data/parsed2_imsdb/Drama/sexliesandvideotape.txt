l i e s a n d v i d e o t a p e graham dalton twenty nine drives his cutlass while smoking a cigarette
one could describe his appearance as punk arty but neither would do him justice
he is a man of obvious intelligence and his face is amiable
there is only one key on his keyring and it is in the ignition
voice over garbage
i started thinking about what happens to all the garbage
i mean where do we put all of it we have to run out of places to put it eventually dont we
this happened to me before when that barge with all the garbage was stranded and nobody would take it
ann bishop millaney twenty six sits opposite her therapist
she is an extremely attractive woman dressed in a mature preppy style
there is a wedding ring on her left hand
yes i remember
what do you do when these moods overtake you
i mean nothing
i try not to do anything that will produce garbage so obviously were talking about eating and basic stuff like that
did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day
no i didnt
dont you think thats a lot of garbage
id really like to know where its all going to go
do you have any idea what triggered this concern
well this weekend john was taking out the garbage and he kept spilling things out of the container and i started imagining a container that grew garbage like it just
kept filling up and overflowing all by itself and how could you stop that if it started happening
ann do you see a pattern here
what do you mean
well last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities and now were talking about your concern over the garbage problem
if you think about it i think youll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldnt possibly have any control over
well do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are
i mean maybe they do but i doubt those people are in therapy
besides being happy isnt all that great
my figure is always at its best when im depressed
the last time i was really happy i put on twenty five pounds
i thought john was going to have a stroke
voice over its true im telling you
john millaney twenty nine sits at his desk talking on the telephone
he is dressed very well sporting real suspenders with his striped pinpoint oxford shirt and cotton suit
he fingers the wedding ring on his left hand
as soon as youve got a ring on your finger you start getting serious attention from the opposite gender
seriously i wish i had super bowl seats for every time i had some filly just come up and start talking to me without the slightest provocation
that never happened before i got married
shit if id known that id have gone out and bought me a ring when i was eighteen and saved myself a lot of time and money
john looks at his watch
shit i gotta be someplace
quickly look racquetball thursday
youre the coolest
john presses the intercom button while putting on his jacket
uh janet re schedule kirkland
tell him to come in friday at
voice over to ann are you still keeping these thoughts from john
voice over yes
john brushes his teeth and combs his hair very carefully
voice over to ann are you afraid of his reaction
of his finding you silly for thinking of such things
voice over no
i dont know
i havent told him about the garbage thing because im pissed off at him right now
hes letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days and he didnt even ask me about it
i mean i wouldve said yes i just wish he wouldve asked
what upsets you about that
i guess im upset because i cant really justify being upset i mean its his house really he pays the mortgage
but he asked you to quit your job and you do have housework
yeah i know
this unexpected visit notwithstanding how are things with john
shrugs fine i guess
except right now i m going through this where i dont want him to touch me
cynthia bishop anns sister opens her door to reveal the freshly coifed john millaney
they kiss passionately and begin to disrobe
cynthia bears a slight resemblance to ann but is not as overtly attractive
she does however have a definite carnal appeal and air of confidence that ann lacks
voice over when did you begin having this feeling
voice over about a week ago
i dont know what brought it on i just started feeling like i didnt want him to touch me
voice over to ann prior to this feeling were you comfortable having physical contact with him
voice over oh yeah
pause but see ive never really been into sex that much i mean i like it and everything it just doest freak me out i wouldnt miss it you know
but anyway lately we havent been doing anything at all
like i said its not that i miss it but i m curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden
john and cynthia are now having sex
voice over perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched
voice over but see he stopped before i got that feeling thats why it seems weird to me
i mean im sure he wishes i would initiate things once in awhile and i would except it never occurs to me im always thinking about something else and then
the few times that i have felt like starting something i was by myself
voice over did you do anything
voice over what do you mean
voice over did you masturbate
taken aback god no
i take it youve never masturbated
slightly uncomfortable well i kind of tried once
it just seemed stupid i kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid and kind of uh i dont know and then i was wondering if my dead grandfather
could see me doing this and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we dont know what to do with all that garbage you know
so it was recently that you tried this
exhales head down well kind of recently i guess
but not too recently
there is a pause
im really not up to having a guest in the house
john and cynthia are lying in bed bathed in sweat
ive got to get back to the office
i only get one today
gee how exciting
john rolls over and begins to put his clothes on
i cant let my lunch hour go on too long
ive already skipped one meeting
dont give me this passive aggressive bullshit
if you want to leave leave
my life doesnt stop when you walk out the door you know what im saying
john shakes his head
why dont you just tell me how you really feel
john stands and begins putting on his clothes
i have a friend coming in from out of town ill probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days
meaning well have to cool it for awhile right
a silent shrug from cynthia
john is almost completely dressed
i wish youd quit that bartending job
i hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time
i can handle it
besides the money is good and some of the guys are cute
and you are in no position to be jealous
who said i was jealous
john says nothing
you know id like to try your house sometime
the idea of doing it in my sisters bed gives me a perverse thrill
john thinks about that
i wish i could tell everybody that anns a lousy lay
beautiful popular ann bishop millaney
could be risky
well maybe i could just start a rumor then
no i mean doing it at my house
afraid of getting caught
you should be
can i meet this friend of yours
cynthia i dont think you want to i mean you should see the way he dresses
i really think hes in a bad way
maybe hes the man im looking for
then i wont have to fuck worried husbands all the time
john looks at her for a moment before heading for the door
graham has parked in the millaneys driveway
he opens the trunk revealing a sony mm video rig and a single black duffle bag
he grabs the duffle bag and shuts the trunk
graham knocks at the door
he is stubbing out a cigarette with his beaten tennis shoe when ann answers the door
she is unable to hide her suprise at his appearance
extends his hand graham dalton
ann shakes his hand
can i use your bathroom
ann withdraws her hand
yes come in please
graham moves inside
ann closes the door and motions graham to the rear of the house
straight back first door on the left
graham heads for the bathroom
ann heads for the phone
she dials johns office
forman brent and millaney
john millaney please
this is his wife
graham exits the bathroom
ann quickly hangs up the phone
that was quick
well please sit down
graham sits his manner pleasantly animated
he gets his gitanes from inside his scuffed black leather jacket and looks around for an ashtray
ann swallows uncomfortably
dont usually let people smoke in the house
we have a patio if you oh no problem
it can wait
a moment of silence
graham looks at ann directly
it is not a challenging stare hes just trying to ascertain what kind of person she is
ann to her credit somehow meets his gaze
something subtle passes between them
looks at duffle bag do you have other things
pause oh you mean to bring in
yes i have some other things no i dont need to bring them in
this is all i need to stay here
he has an unusual face a face that fluctuates between remarkably handsome and just plain strange
have you ever been on television
the central air conditioning switches on
graham is an unusual name
yeah i guess it is
my mother is a complete anglophile anything british makes her drool like a baby
she probably heard the name in some movie
shes a prisoner of public television now
oh uh huh
are you uncomfortable with my appearance
downplaying no i think you look
well maybe im uncomfortable with my appearance
i feel a little out of place in these surroundings
i used to take great pleasure in that being purposefully different rubbing peoples noses in it
didnt you do that when you were younger
thinks no not really
well i did
i was in a band once and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible
you play an instrument
no i was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone
the whole thing was really
how do you like being married
caught slightly off guard oh i like it
i like it very much
what about it do you like
im not being critical id really like to know
well the cliche about the security of it thats really true
we own a house and i really like that you know
and i like that john was just made junior partner so he has a steady job and hes not some
ann looks at graham and stops
he smiles again
so you feel security stability
like things are going to last awhile
i mean just this past year has gone by like phew
i hardly even knew it passed
did you know that if you shut someone up in a room and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twenty four that his
body will eventually adjust to that schedule
simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty six hours are twenty four the body follows
and then there are sections of time
your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality if you have one
for instance when i was twelve i had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship
now im not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to and then were crystallized in
that eleven minutes
ann is fascinated if a bit overwhelmed
oh uh huh
smiles anyway i think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned
you mean like time flies
i would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things
or could mean lots of things
how long has it been since youve seen john
i was surprised that he accepted when i asked if i could stay here until i found a place
didnt you know him well
i knew him very well
we were extremely close until i dropped out
whyd you drop out
oh lots of reasons most of them boring
but up until i dropped out john and i were
very much alike
thats hard to believe
the two of you seem so different
i would imagine that we are now
i think im ready to use the bathroom finally
graham gets up and heads for the toilet
ann watches him go a bemused smile on her face
after she hears the door close she cant resist the impulse to take a closer look at grahams bag
in the bathroom graham pokes around looking through the medicine cabinet and sniffing towels
voice over call the cops
john ann and graham are eating dinner
to graham thats the first thing that ran through my mind when i saw you
i thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade
to graham you did that
everybody has a past
smiles at graham what do you think the greeks would make of that outfit youre wearing
a bonfire probably
john takes a sip of chivas
to ann this food is excellent
yeah its not bad
usually ann has some serious salt action going
i keep telling her you can always add more if you want but you cant take it out
to ann you have family here also
nods chewing mother father sister
sister older or younger
john takes a large swig of chivas
are you close
graham sees ann and john exchange looks
am i prying again
you were prying before
yes this afternoon
i was grilling ann about your marriage this afternoon
howd it go
she held up very well
to ann so i was asking about your sister
anns smile fades
john resumes eating
oh we get along okay
shes just very
shes an extrovert
i think shes loud
she probably wouldnt agree
definitely wouldnt agree
to graham are you going to see elizabeth while you re here
an almost imperceptible reaction by graham
i dont know
interested whos elizabeth
girl graham dated
still lives here far as i know
graham eats in silence
graham and i were talking about apartments and i told him to check the garden district there are some nice little places there garage apartments and stuff
to graham stay away from the garden district
i dont know what kind of place youre looking for but there are a lot of studio type apartments available elsewhere
i wish i didnt have to live someplace
laughs what do you mean
graham thinks a moment then puts his keyring with its single key onto the table
well see right now i have this one key and i really like that
everything i own is in my car
if i get an apartment thats two keys
if i get a job maybe i have to open and close once in awhile thats more keys
or i buy some stuff and i m worried about getting ripped off so i get some locks and thats more keys
i just really like having the one key
its clean you know
graham looks at the keyring before returning it to his pocket
get rid of the car when you get your apartment then youll still have one key
i like having the car the car is important
especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry
or go someplace in a hurry
ann takes her plate into the kitchen
smiles at graham do you pay taxes
graham also stands empty plate in hand
do i pay taxes
of course i pay taxes only a liar doesnt pay taxes im not a liar
a liar is the second lowest form of human being
from the kitchen whats the first
john smiles thinking
graham follows ann into the kitchen
john shouts after them
hey ann why dont you go with graham to hunt for apartments
show him how the city has changed
ann looks at graham
would you mind
shouts back to john okay i will
john sitting at the table and now toying with his keyring nods
everyone but ann is asleep
she gets up from her bed and sneaks quietly into the guest bedroom where graham is staying
she walks cautiously up to his bed to watch him as he sleeps
moonlight caresses his face as he breathes peacefully
exhaling he turns over slowly his back to ann
she picks up his jacket from beside the bed and feels the surface
she brings the jacket to her nose inhaling his presence
she then sets the jacket down
the phone rings
meet me at my house in exactly one hour
you are scum
ill be there
graham and ann walk around the room their footfalls heavy on the hardwood floors
miller the landlord stands nearby
he looks fairly interested in ann
plenty of room for two people
itll just be me
pause you said three fifty
plus first and last month deposit
will you lease month to month
not for three fifty
how about for five hundred
miller looks at ann then back at graham
that i can do
cynthia lets herself in
she looks around
offscreen in here
cynthia walks to the bedroom where john lies naked on the bed
she smiles kicking off her shoes
aint you a picture
cynthia begins taking her clothes off
she places her diamond stud earring in her jacket pocket and then drops the jacket on the floor
she moves onto the bed with john
voice over maybe youll understand this because you know john but he confuses me sometimes
voice over how do you mean
graham and ann are having lunch
ann looks to have had a lot of wine
graham drinks club soda with a twist
its hard to explain
john treats everybody the same you know
i mean he acts just as excited about seeing somebody he hardly knows as he does when he sees me
and so i feel like whats different about me if im treated exactly the same as some acquaintance
if i dont like somebody i dont act like i do
i guess thats why a lot of people think im a bitch
she takes a sip of wine
yeah i know
i mean im not saying i know people think youre a bitch im saying i know what you mean
and i dont even know that people think youre a bitch
i feel like they do
well maybe you are
really i wouldnt pay much attention
i know that i just dont feel a connection with very many people so i dont waste time with people i dont feel one with
i dont feel connected to many people either
other than john
can i tell you something personal
i feel like i can
its something i couldnt tell john
or wouldnt anyway
its up to you
but i warn you if you tell me something personal i might do the same
i think sex is overrated
i think people place way too much importance on it
and i think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap
i m not saying women dont want it i just dont think they want it for the reason men think they do
smiles im getting confused
do you understand what im trying to say
i think so
i remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what theyre attracted to whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love
i think thats very true
graham watches ann take a sip of wine
so what about kids
what about them
do you want them
yeah actually i do
but john doesnt
at least not right now
why is that
i dont know he just said he wants to wait
i quit asking
so whats your personal thing
are you really going to tell me something personal
do you want me to
as long as its not
gross you know
like some scar or something
it has to be like mine like something about you
graham takes a sip of club soda
ann looks at him closely
well let me put it this way i cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person
so for all practical purposes i am impotent
ann takes a large sip of wine
graham lights a cigarette
does it bother you
exhales not usually
i mean honestly i havent known many guys that could think straight with an erection so i feel im way ahead of the game as far as being clear headed
are you self conscious about it
i am self conscious but not in the same way that you are
you have got to be the most attractive self conscious person ive ever seen
why do you say im self conscious
well ive been watching you
ive watched you eat ive watched you speak ive watched the way you move and i see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at
i think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time
and you know what
they are looking at you
ann you are truly breathtaking
i dont know if you understand how your appearance can affect people
men want to possess you women wish they looked like you
and those that dont or cant resent you
and the fact that youre a nice person just makes it worse
thinks my therapist said that youre in therapy
no im not
actually i used to be but the therapist i had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems
of course i lied to him constantly so i guess i cant hold him totally responsible
so you dont believe in therapy
i believe in it for some people
i mean for me it was silly i was confused going in
so i just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesnt know you intimately
well my therapist knows me intimately
surprised you had sex with you therapist
of course not
oh see i meant someone youve had sex with
thats part of the theory
excuse me for asking but how would you know
smiles well i wasnt always impotent
ann takes another sip of wine and thinks for a moment
now you said never take advice from someone that you dont know intimately right
cynthia is leaving the house
she gives john a big kiss
voice over so since ive never had sex with you by your own advice i shouldnt accept your advice
voice over thats correct
pause bit of a dilemma isnt it
cynthia is not wearing her diamond stud earring
well i dont know
the week started off okay but then i was outside watering the plants and i started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the greenhouse effect
so i went inside and turned on the air conditioner full blast and that made me feel a little better until i started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor and radon leakage
yes its this radioactive gas in the ground and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up and youve never heard of this
no i havent
well the cumulative effect is not good let me tell you
pause i knew i shouldnt have watered those plants
did you confront john about the visitor
the friend of johns that was staying at your house
no i didnt talk to him about that
actually that turned out to be pretty interesting
i expected graham to be this
well like john you know
i mean he said they had gone to school together so i was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff
but he turned out to be this
this kind of character i mean hes kind of arty but okay you know
is he still at your house
no he left last week
did you find him attractive
what do you mean like physically
let me rephrase
were you attracted to him
thinks i guess but not because of the way he looked or anything
hes just so different somebody new to have a conversation with
im just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not theyre going to buy the station wagon you know
its just boring
i dont know he was just different
and hes really on about truth a lot being honest and i like that i felt comfortable around him
pause after he left i had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room
voice over so wheres he from
ann stands watching cynthia get dressed for work
i dont know
he went to school here then he was in new york for awhile then philadelphia and then just kind of travelling around
must be nice
so whats he like is he like john
no not at all
actually i dont think john likes him much anymore
he said he thought graham had gotten strange
strange i mean
maybe if i just saw him on the street id have said that but after talking to him
hes just kind of
i dont know unusual
so whats he look like
i just want to know what he looks like is all
why so you can go after him
jesus ann get a life
i just asked what he looked like
ann says nothing
besides even if i decided to fuck his brains out what business is that of yours
do you have to say that
you know what
you say it just to irritate me
i say it because its descriptive
well he doesnt strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing anyway
ann you always underestimate me
well i wonder why
i think youre afraid to put the two of us in the same room together
i think youre afraid hell be undeniably drawn to me
oh for gods sake
really cynthia really i dont think hes your type
what is this bullshit
how would you know what my type is
i have a pretty good idea
ann you dont have a clue
look i dont even know why were discussing this ill just call him myself
he doesnt have a phone
well ill call him when he does
but he wont
what are you talking about
hes not getting a phone he doesnt like talking on the phone
okay so give me the zen masters address ill think of a reason to stop by
let me talk to him first
just give me the address you wont even have to be involved
i dont feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and
do whatever it is you do
cynthia laughs loudly
ann not happy watches her dig through the jewelry box
that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune
are you getting mom something for her birthday
i dont know ill get her a card or something
for her fiftieth birthday
whats wrong with that
dont you think she deserves a little more than a card
i mean the woman gave birth to you
it s her fiftieth birthday will you stop
i just thought it might okay ann okay
how about this you buy her something nice and ill pay for half
now if youll pardon me i have to go to work
i was thinking maybe i shouldnt be in therapy anymore
what brought this on
ive been thinking about it for awhile and then i was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me
smiles i thought thats what i did
who was it that you talked to
that guy graham i told you about
he said taking advice from someone you dont know intimately was
well he said a lot of stuff
the doctor exhales thinking for a moment
ann in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas
pause did it occur to you that graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy
what do you mean
i dont understand
its possible that graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and or therapists
perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with and he would like to see other people you for instance wallow in their situation just
as he does
do you think thats possible
you understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time
that you are under no obligation to me
do you want to leave therapy
do you feel there is more progress to be made
im glad you feel that way because i feel that way too
but you dont have hidden motives for feeling that way right
the doctor laughs
ann does not laugh with him
on a television monitor we see images originating from an mm video deck
graham sits naked in a sheet covered chair facing the screen
he watches the tape which is footage of himself interviewing a girl about her sexual preferences
the photography on the tape is handheld relentless
as the questions get more detailed graham becomes more aroused
there is a knock on grahams door
he calmly shuts off the videotape player and stands wrapping the sheet around himself
graham walks into the bedroom to put on some clothes
ann opens the door and walks into the apartment
are you in the middle of something
off nothing i cant finish later
looks i just wanted to see how the place looked furnished
off not much to see im afraid
im sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe
somehow i imagined books
i thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time
i do read a lot
but i check everything out of the library
graham picks up an anais nin diary and opens it to show ann the library sleeve inside
cheaper that way
and cuts down on the clutter
ann walks to the table where the video gear is set up
graham watches her closely
she looks into a large box of mm videotapes
on the side of each tape is a label
the labels look like this and so on
there are thirty or forty tapes total
what are these
smiles i can see that
what are they
its a personal project im working on
what kind of personal project
oh just a personal project like anyone elses personal project
mines just a little more personal
on this tape it says donna
thinking donna was a girl i knew in florida
you went out with her
ann looks in the box again
how come all these are girls names
graham thinks for a moment
because i enjoy interviewing women more than men
all of these are interviews
can we look at one
because i promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me
ann looks at graham for a long moment then back at the tapes
what are these interviews about
interviews are about sex ann
what about sex
everything about sex
like what theyve done what they do what they dont do what they want to do but are afraid to ask for what they wont do even if asked
anything i can think of
you just ask them questions
and they just answer them
sometimes they do things
no not to me for me for the camera
stunned i dont
why do you do this
im sorry this came up
this is just
maybe you want to go
yes i do
ann nods and absently heads for the door
she gives graham a puzzled look before leaving
ann is talking to cynthia on the telephone
still shaken i dont
he doesnt want you to come over
what do you mean he doesnt want me to come over
did you tell him about me
no i didnt
because i never got around to it
cynthia look john was right
graham is strange
you dont want to get involved with him
what the hell happened over there
did he make a pass at you
then whats the story whats this strange bullshit all of a sudden
is he drowning puppies or what
no its nothing like that
is he dangerous
no hes not dangerous
well what then
i dont want to talk about it
then whyd you call me
i dont know
ann hangs up
cynthia gets out of the shower
the phone rings
she wraps herself in a towel and lifts the receiver
ive got other plans
pause well when then
how about inviting me over to dinner
you know what i mean
yeah i know what you mean
cynthia hangs up the phone
graham sits smoking a cigarette
there is a knock at his door
graham looks up at her
who are you
im cynthia bishop
do i know you
im ann millaneys sister
smiles she must have been in a good mood when she said that
she usually calls me loud
she called you that too
may i ask why you re here
you want me to leave
i just want to know why youre here
well like i said ann is my sister
you can imagine the rest
no i really cant
i find it healthy never to characterize people i dont know or conversations i havent heard
i dont know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else
last time i saw ann she left here very
confused i would say
she still is
and are you here to berate me for making her that way
she didnt tell you why she was upset
she didnt give you my address
how did you find me
i uh know a guy at the power company
i dont understand
why did you want to come here
i mean i cant imagine ann painted a very flattering portrait of me
well i dont really listen to her when it comes to men
i mean look at john for crissake
oh you went to school with him didnt you
youre probably friends or something
i think the man is a liar
smiles i think youre right
so come on i came all the way over here to find out what got ann so spooked tell me what happened
he motions to the box of videotapes
that box of tapes is what got ann so spooked
cynthia goes over to the box and looks inside for a long moment studying the labels
i think i get it
what do you get
well they must be something sexual because ann gets freaked out by that shit
are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something
well either you are or you arent
which is it
why dont you let me tape you
your sexual history your sexual preferences
what makes you think id discuss that with you
you just want to ask me questions
i just want to ask you questions
and thats all
a crooked smile is this how you get off or something
taping women talking about their sexual experiences
would anybody else see the tape
they are for my private use only
how do we start
i turn on the camera
you start talking
and you ask questions right
how long will it take
that depends on you
one woman only used three minutes
another filled up three two hour tapes
can i see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what no
thinks do i sit or stand
whichever you prefer
id rather sit
are you ready
just a moment
graham grabs his mm video camera puts in a new tape and turns it on
i am now recording
tell me your name
cynthia patrice bishop
describe for me your first sexual experience
my first sexual experience or the first time i had intercourse
your first sexual experience
thinks i was
eight years old
michael green who was also eight asked if he could watch me take a pee
i said he could if i could watch him take one too
he said okay and then we went into the woods behind our house
i got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying ladies first
so i pulled down my underpants and urinated and he ran away before i even finished
was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward
he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer and then his family moved away
to cleveland actually
so when did you finally get to see a penis
when i was fourteen
live or in a photograph or film of some sort
very much live
what did you think
did it look like you expected
i didnt picture it with veins or ridges or anything i thought it would be smooth like a test tube
were you disappointed
if anything after i looked at it awhile it got more interesting
it had character you know
what about when you touched it
what did you expect it to feel like and then what did it really feel like
it was warmer than i thought it would be and the skin was softer than it looked
thinking about it now the organ itself seemed like a separate thing a separate entity to me
i mean after he pulled it out and i could look at it and touch it i completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it
i remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me
what did he say
he said that my hand felt good
then what happened
then i started moving my hand and then he stopped talking
cynthia adjusting her clothes opens the door to leave
she looks very aroused
she and graham do not speak or touch
john millaney picks up a telephone and presses a blinking button
i want to see you
jesus i dont know if i can get away
ive got a client waiting
id have to do some heavy duty juggling
then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here
she hangs up
john thinks a moment then hits his intercom button
janet re schedule kirkland see if he can come in friday
smooth things out tell him an emergency came up
ill slip out the back
graham watches cynthias tape becoming excited
voice on tape would you like me to take my pants off
voice on tape if you wish
pause youre not wearing any underwear
voice on tape do you like the way i look
voice on tape yes
voice on tape do you think im pretty
voice on tape yes
voice on tape prettier than ann
voice on tape different
cynthia and john are having sex
to graham voice on tape john doesnt have sex with ann anymore
voice on tape is that what he tells you
voice on tape he doesnt have to tell me
cynthia has an intense orgasm
she rolls off of john sweating
you are on fire today
you can go now
voice over if you wont talk to me i cant help you
a moment of silence
john is starting to put his clothes on
cynthia lies in bed her eyes closed her face serene
voice over i hate my sister
rambling because all she thinks about are these guys shes after and i just hate her shes such a little slut i thought that in high school and i think
why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all whats the big damn deal
i mean its okay and everything but i dont understand when people let it control them control their lives why do they do that
ann lies awake in bed beside john who is sound asleep
voice over there are many things that can exert control over ones life good and bad
religion greed philanthropy drugs
voice over i know but this
i just feel like everybody i know right now is obsessed with sex
ann looks over at john
she slowly reaches under the covers and grasps his penis
without waking he rolls over and turns his back to her
she returns to looking at the ceiling
voice over except john i guess
ann is talking to cynthia on the phone
ann looks very morose
he just asked me questions
what kinds of questions
questions about sex
well like what did he ask exactly
well like i dont want to tell you exactly
oh so youll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape but you wont tell your own sister
did he ask you to take your clothes off
did he ask me to take my clothes off
no he didnt
did you take your clothes off
yes i did
why did you do that
because i wanted to
but why did you want to
i wanted him to see me
cynthia who knows where that tape may end up
he could be
bouncing it off some satellite or something
some horny old men in south america or something could be watching it
he wouldnt do that
you dont know that for sure
well its too late now isnt it
did he touch you
no but i did
you touched him
no i touched me
wait a minute
do you mean
dont tell me you
in front of him
in front of him ann yes
serious you are in trouble
laughs listen to you
you sound like mom
what are you talking about
outraged i can t believe you did that
i mean i couldnt do that in front of john even
you couldnt do it period
you know what i mean you dont even know him
i feel like i do
that doesnt mean you do
you cant possibly trust him hes
he just sits around and looks at these tapes
whats the big deal
so hes got this catalogue of women touching themselves
that doesnt make you feel weird
i dont think they all did what i did
you are in serious trouble
ann i dont understand why this freaks you out so much
you didnt do it i did and if it doesnt bother me why should it bother you
i dont want to discuss it
then why do you keep asking about it
a sparse daytime crowd
cynthia serves a beer to some dude
he puts the money down on the bar and looks at her
as marlon brando are you an assassin
still brando youre an errand boy
sent by grocery clerks
to collect a bill
ann enters the lounge carrying a package
to cynthia brando its brando come on
cynthia moves down the bar to meet ann
i wish youd get an answering machine
theres a phone here
it was busy
ann opens the package revealing a lovely sun dress
here it is
what is it
its a sun dress
it looks like a tablecloth
it does not
well why would she want a sun dress
shes got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins
so will you someday
yeah and when i do i wont be wearing sun dresses
the lounge phone rings
i was just trying to hold on
cynthia walks to the other end of the bar to answer the phone
the dude watches her pass
then he turns to ann and gives her the once over
he spots the present
ann says nothing
wanna hear my walter matthau
youll love this
as matthau feeelix what are you craaazee
back to normal pretty good huh
cynthia picks up the phone
well this is timely
your wife is here would you like to speak to her
whats she doing there
she came by to show me a present that she and i are buying for your mother in law
when can i see you
i dont know
im not sure i can duplicate the level of intensity i had the other day
nothing wrong with trying
i dont think my sister would agree
do you want me to stop calling
look ill call you okay
cynthia hangs up and walks back to ann
so whats my share of the dress
thirty two dollars
cynthia pulls thirty five bucks out of her jeans
she watches ann put the money away
look dont worry about the dress im sure shell love it
to ann and cynthia hey
how about tom brokaw
nobody does brokaw
as tom brokaw in iran today
graham sits reading a book
there is a knock at his door
it s open
cynthia enters the room looking very intent on something
graham sets his book down
he looks at her for a moment then drags on his cigarette
look im just going to come right out and tell you why im here okay
id like to make another tape
graham thinks for a moment
not even one more
i never do more than one
i cant talk you into it
youll have to get somebody else
now who the hell is going to do that for me
im sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer
but i want you to do it i want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything somebody i can play to and feel safe because you cant do
okay i deserved that
cynthia dont you understand
after the first time its just not spontaneous
theres no edge anymore
look at the tapes there is only one date on each label
i have never taped anyone twice
so make an exception
how about if you record over the one we already made
you could have the same date and not use another tape
who would know
well what the hell am i supposed to do
cynthia i dont know
i cant believe youre doing this after i let you tape me
i cant do it
goddamit give me my tape then
cynthia heads for the tape box
graham leaps up to stop her
digging through the box its my fucking tape you asshole graham grabs her wrists momentarily
i told you what the parameters were and you agreed
its my tape
i look at it i touch it nobody else
cynthia and graham look at each other for a long moment
please go id like you to go now
cynthia looks at him
john and ann lie in bed
the lights are out
ann is wide awake while john is on the verge of sleep
he rolls over and puts his arm around her
she gets up and sits in a chair opposite the bed
i called you tuesday at and they said you werent in
do you remember where you were
john and cynthia are in cynthias bed kissing
on the floor johns watch reads pm
i had a late lunch
did you see a message to call me when you got back in
john leaves cynthias house and drives straight home greeting ann as he steps through the front door
i just got busy
thats interesting because i didnt leave a message
john is waking up a little
then maybe i saw an old message
there are a lot of them on my desk you know
whod you have lunch with
i ate by myself
are you having an affair
jesus christ whered that come from
i have a late lunch by myself and now im fucking somebody
well are you
no im not
frankly im offended at the accusation
if im right i want to know
i dont want you to lie
id be very upset but not as upset as if id found out youd been lying
theres nothing to know ann
i cant tell you how upset i would be if you were lying
ann you are completely paranoid
not ten minutes ago i wanted to make love for the first time in weeks and you act like im dipped in shit
you know i think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with
a hard on
my sister for one
is that who it is
for gods sake ann i am not fucking your sister
i dont find her that attractive for one
is that supposed to comfort me
i was just saying you know
i didnt get paranoid when you didnt want to make love
i could have easily assumed that you didnt want to because you were having an affair
but im not
im not either
why dont i believe you
look this conversation is utterly ridiculous
maybe when you have some evidence we should talk but dont give me conjecture and intuition
always the lawyer
i mean can you imagine your honor im positive this man is guilty
i cant place him at the scene or establish a motive but i have this really strong feeling
youve made your point
im under a lot of pressure with this kirkland thing its my first big case as junior partner and i work all day i come home i look forward to
seeing you and
it hurts that you accuse me like that
im sorry too
i get these ideas in my head you know and i have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios
and then i want to believe it so i dont think ive wasted the whole day
last week i was convinced you were having an affair with cynthia i dont know why
i dont either
i mean cynthia of all people
jeez give me some credit
i didnt say it was rational i just said i was convinced
isnt therapy helping at all
i dont know
sometimes i feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world
quitting your therapy wont feed the children of ethiopia
you never used to say fucking
john sits on the edge of cynthias bed slowly undressing
its just so blatantly stupid i have a hard time believing you did it
whats so stupid about it
you dont even know the guy
well you know him hes a friend of yours do you think he can be trusted
shit after what youve told me i dont know
i shouldve known when he showed up dressed like some arty brat
i like the way he dresses
what if this tape gets into the wrong hands
the wrong hands
were not talking about military secrets john
theyre just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off
and he doesnt have sex with any of them
they just talk
i could almost understand it if he was screwing these people almost
why doesnt he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something
he has to know the people he has to be able to interact with them
interact fine but did you have to masturbate in front of him for gods sake
i felt like it so what
goddam you and ann make such a big deal out of it
you told ann about this
she is my sister
i tell her almost everything
i wish you hadnt done that
its just something id prefer she didnt know about
shes a grown up she can handle it
ann is very
it just wasnt a smart thing to do
did you sign any sort of paper or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldnt broadcast these tapes
you realize you have no recourse legally
this stuff could show up anywhere
i trust him
disbelieving you trust him
yeah i do
a helluva lot more than i trust you
what do you mean
exactly what i said
id trust him before id trust you
how much clearer can i be
it hurts that you would say that to me
laughs oh please
come on john
youre fucking your wifes sister and you hardly been married a year
youre a liar
but at least i know youre a liar
its the people that dont know like ann that have to watch out
by definition youre lying to ann too
but i never took a vow in front of god and everybody to be faithful to my sister
look are we going to do it or not
actually no ive changed my mind
i shouldnt have called
ingratiating well im here now
id like to do something
how about straightening up the living room
john doesnt smile
come on john
you should be happy weve gone this far without ann finding out im making it real easy on you
just walk out of here and ill see you at your house for a family dinner sometime
did he put you up to this
no he didnt put me up to this
jesus i dont need people to tell me what i should do
ive just been thinking about things thats all
i cant believe i let him stay in my house
right under my nose
that deviant fucker was right under my nose and i didnt see him
if he had been under your prick youd have spotted him for sure
looks at her god you
will you please leave now
maybe i dont want to leave
maybe i want to talk
john we have nothing to talk about
i knew it i knew it
things are getting complicated
no john things are getting real simple
ann dressed in some of johns work clothes old cotton shirt khaki pants is cleaning the house
not cleaning like a normal person but like an obsessive compulsive person
scrubbing spots that are already clean vacuuming the same area of rug over and over etc
suddenly an object lodges itself in the snout of the vacuum cleaner making a loud noise
shutting the machine off ann turns it over and sees that cynthias diamond stud earring has gotten hooked in the take up roller
ann stares at cynthias earring for a long moment
cynthia picking up her jacket from beside the bed after having sex with john
the earring slips out of the pocket and bounces under the edge of the bed
ann as she sets the earring onto the floor and begins to pound it with the bottom of a water glass trying to smash it to pieces
she soon realizes the futility of trying to break a diamond
ann looks down at herself
suddenly realizing that she is dressed in johns clothing she frantically rips the shirt and pants from her body as though the material were burning her skin
popped buttons skid across the floor
clothed only in her bra and underwear ann sits in the middle of the bedroom floor arms around herself
ann now in jeans and t shirt stumbles to her car
once inside she jams the key into the ignition and rests her head against the steering wheel
ann lifts her head from the steering wheel and looks up
she looks almost surprised to find that she has driven to grahams
slowly she gets out of the car
graham sits reading
there is a weak knock at the door
graham listens not sure he heard anything
there is a second weak knock
graham gets up and opens the door himself
ann stands against the wall of the hallway her head down her breathing deliberate
concerned graham slowly begins to lead her inside
impulsively she hugs him tightly
unaccustomed to physical contact grahams hands hang awkwardly at his side
ann slowly pulls back from the embrace and sits down
graham goes to the kitchen area and gets her a glass of water
he gives it to her and sits in the chair opposite
ann holds the glass in her hand staring at it
its bottled not tap
a weak smile from ann
she drinks swallowing with difficulty
im not sure why i came here
i had kind of decided not to talk to you after
that son of a bitch
ann looks at graham
sarcastic john and cynthia have been
stunned you know
how did you know
she said it on her tape
angry why didnt you tell me
ann when would i have told you
we were not speaking if you recall
ann says nothing
but even if we had been speaking i wouldnt have told you
its not my place to tell you these things ann
you have to find out by yourself or from john directly
you have to trust me on this
ann shakes her head
my life is
its all shit
its like somebody saying okay chairs are not chairs theyre actually swimming pools i mean nothing is what i thought it was
what happened to me
have i been asleep
i vaguely remember the wedding but a lot of it is just a blur
like i was watching from a distance
i cant believe him
why didnt i trust my intuition
graham says nothing
and im vacuuming his goddam rug
his rug that he paid to have put in his house
nothing in that place belongs to me
i wanted to put some of my grandmothers furniture in it but he wouldnt let me
so i m vacuuming his rug
ann looks at graham
i want to make a tape
do you think thats such a good idea
dont you want to make one
but i sense the element of revenge here
what difference does it make why i do it
i want you to be aware of what youre doing and why because i know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame
what would you know about a normal frame of mind
impressed thats a good question
what do you have to do to get ready
load a new tape turn the camera on
then do it
graham opens a new box of videotapes
how do you pay for all this
i mean rent and tapes and this equipment
i have money
what will you do when the money runs out
are you ready
graham turns the camera on
tell me your name
ann bishop millaney
street lights are illuminated
night is imminent
graham stops the video recorder
the record meter is stopped at
ann sits beside graham on the couch
she looks into his eyes stroking his hair
after a moment she gets up to leave
john is talking on the phone as ann walks through the door
he mumbles an apology into the receiver and hangs up as ann moves to the couch her expression calm
worried jesus christ
what the hell happened
i came home and your car was gone the door was open i thought for sure youd been abducted by some mad fucker i was literally just calling the cops
when you walked in
i want out of this marriage
genuinely shocked what
looks at him i want out of this marriage
well call it uncontested or whatever
i just want out
john moves to sit beside her on the couch
ann does not look at him
conciliatory ann honey please tell me whats wrong
dont just say you want out and leave me wondering
you cant just go without telling me why
ann turns to look at him for a moment then turns away
i can do what i want
johns mouth literally hangs open in shock
he is dumbstruck
ill stay at my mothers
john gets up from the couch and begins pacing
where did you go when you left here
i drove around
then i went to talk with graham
john smacks his hand on his leg
that son of a bitch
thinking well at least i know you didnt fuck him
no but i wanted to
i really wanted to partially just to piss you off
john is seething
youre leaving me for him arent you
well that makes a sad sort of sense
he cant and you wont
im not going to discuss this with you anymore
youre making no sense
john walks over to ann
did you make one of those goddam tapes
ann says nothing
answer me godammit
did you make one of those tapes
john explodes hitting the wall all around ann
she cowers beneath the storm
john bolts from the house
graham stands in the middle of the room with a cigarette in his mouth trying to teach himself to moonwalk
john screeches to a halt parking haphazardly
he gets out of the car and runs to grahams apartment
john bursts through the door without bothering to knock
graham looks up startled
before he can even react john has him by the lapels
where are the tapes graham
you know which tapes
where are they
john as a lawyer you should know that those tapes are private property
so is my wife asshole
shes not property john shes a person
were you just going to keep right on lying to her
what the hell do you think
i love ann
you think im going to tell her about cynthia and hurt her feelings like that
god you need help
i need help
whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes graham
not me buddy
youre the fucking nut
now show me those tapes
im not kidding graham youd better do what i say
give me those tapes
john punches graham in the jaw knocking him to the floor
graham feels his mouth for blood as john picks him up by the shirt
graham i swear to christ ill kill your scrawny ass
now give me those tapes
john roughly pushes graham into one of the directors chairs which topples over and throws graham to the floor once again
john looks around
he sees the boxes of tapes and begins to go through the contents
graham gets up and runs over to stop him
get away from those
they belong to me
graham and john struggle
john hits graham in the stomach and pushes him to the floor
give me your keys
john bends over and starts going through grahams pockets
your keys asshole
your two fucking keys
give them to me
im not going to give you my keys
john beats graham until graham can offer no resistance
he then drags graham into the hallway and leaves him there
john then locks himself inside grahams apartment
john walks over to the boxes of videotapes and begins to search through them spastically
he finds both cynthia and anns tapes
after a brief deliberation he decides to watch anns
he turns on the player and the monitor
after pulling a chair up to the screen john presses the button marked play
in the hallway graham drags himself to the door of his apartment
putting his ear to the inlet he strains to hear what is going on inside
john watches the monitor come to life
the image is ann sitting in a chair
on tape tell me your name
on tape ann bishop millaney
on tape you are married correct
on tape yes
on tape who usually initiates sex
johns jaw tightens
on tape he does
on tape do you talk to him
on tape when were making love
on tape yes
on tape sometimes
on tape does he go down on you
shouting at graham you son of a bitch
on tape not very often
on tape i would
john is literally so mad he cant speak
he watches the screen in mute anger his hands wrapped tightly around the arms of the chair
graham still listens from the hallway
on tape have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband
to anns image answer him goddammit
on tape youre hesitating
i think that means you have
to graham on tape shut up
on tape you dont know what im thinking
on tape its a simple question
have you ever thought of having making love with someone other than your husband
john leans forward
on tape is he going to see this
on tape absolutely not
a sarcastic chuckle from john
in the hallway graham furrows his brow
on tape i have thought about it yes
to anns image you bitch
i knew it
on tape did you have sex before you were married
on tape yes
on tape did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband
to graham god damn you
on tape yes
john stands and throws his chair against the door
graham still listening at the door is startled
on tape and you have thought about
making love to that person again since you ve been married
john watches the monitor his eyes beginning to water
on tape i dont see what difference it makes i mean i can think what i want
pause i dont know if i want to do this anymore im afraid
i dont mind answering the questions so much but if somebody were to see this
on tape at some level i dont understand your nervousness
have you decided to leave john
on tape yes i have
on tape then as far as this taping goes you have nothing to worry about
on tape i guess not
on tape do you want me to stop
john absorbed in the image absently shakes his head
on tape no
on tape are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about
on tape yes
all right look
whenever i see a man that i think is attractive i wonder what it would be like with him i mean im just curious i dont act on it but
i hate that i think that
i wish i could just forget about that stuff
on tape why
on tape because thats how cynthia thinks
all she does is think about that stuff and i hate that i dont want to be like her i dont want to be like her
on tape youre not like your sister
you couldnt be like her if you wanted to
on tape i know
deep down i know that
it just bothers me when i have feelings or impulses that she has
john picks up the chair he threw and sets it upright
he sits down and watches the screen impassively
graham still listens from outside
on tape so you do fantasize
on tape yes
on tape about who
on tape i fantasized about you
on tape about me
on tape yes
on tape have you fantasized about me
on tape i thought i made that clear before when i said i would go down on you
on tape i remember
you could do that couldnt you
go down on me
on tape yes
on tape if i asked you to would you
not on tape i mean
on tape no
on tape on tape
on tape no
on tape why not
on tape if i cant do it all i dont want to do anything
and i cant do it all
on tape cant or wont
john is still watching the tape his face betraying no emotion
graham still listens from outside
the previous afternoon
we are no longer looking at ann on the monitor but watching her and graham as they made the tape
for instance we can now see graham from anns point of view or the two of them at the same time etc
you said you werent always impotent
so you have had sex
who was the last person you had sex with
her name was elizabeth
so what happened
was it so bad that it turned you off
no it was wonderful
that wasnt the problem
what was the problem
the problem was me
i was a pathological liar
or am i should say
lying is like alcoholism one is always recovering
so you lied to her
willfully and repeatedly
i loved her for how good she made me feel and i hated her for how good she made me feel
and at that time i tended to express my feelings non verbally
i couldnt handle anyone having that much control over my emotions
and now you can
now i make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me
dont you get lonely
how could i with all these nice people stopping by
the fact is that ive lived by myself for so long i cant imagine living with another person
its amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by
and anyway im asking the questions
are you happy
i dont know anymore
i thought i was but obviously i was wrong
did you confront john with the fact that you knew about him
im not sure i will
i just want out
if you do get out of your marriage will you continue to be inhibited
i dont know
it all gets back to that cynthia thing
i dont like her
theres nothing left to imagine theres no
plus ive never really felt able to open up with anyone
i mean that other person i told you about i enjoyed making love with him a lot but i still wasnt able to really let go
i always feel like im being watched and i shouldnt embarrass myself
and you feel the same way with john
i mean johns like this kind of
like hes a carpenter and he makes really good tables
but thats all he can make and i dont need anymore tables
no youre not
thinking god i m so mad at him
you should be
he lied to you
so did cynthia
yeah i know but somehow i expect that from her i mean shell do it with almost anybody i dont know i shouldnt stick up for her i guess but
he lied so
ooo i want to watch him die
ann sits quietly for a moment
graham watches her silently
the camera continues to roll
looks up at graham youre really never going to make love again
im not planning on it
if you were in love with me would you
im not in love with you
but if you were
i cant answer that precisely
but i feel like maybe i could be really comfortable with you
thats very flattering
so why wont you make love with me
why wouldnt you i mean
are you asking me hypothetically or are you asking me for real right now
im asking for real
i want you to turn that camera off and make love with me
ive told you
but i dont understand ann it could happen to me all over again dont you see
i could start to but how do you know for sure you have to try to find a way to fig i couldnt face her if i had slept with
you mean youre still in contact with her
but youre planning to be
i dont know
wait a minute wait a minute
whats going on here
did you come back here just to see her again
but that was part of it
like maybe a big part
graham i mean what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her
i dont know
look at you look at whats happened to you look how youve changed
dont you think she will have changed
i dont know
i really would rather not talk about it
has to laugh whoa
im so glad we got that on tape
you wont answer a question about elizabeth but i have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life
graham what do you think shes going to make of all these videotapes
are you going to tell her about them
i cant imagine her being too understanding about that
but since you dont lie anymore youll have to say something
as i said i havent decided what to do exactly
perhaps i wont do anything
oh you just moved here to think about it right
graham says nothing
ann looks at him
oh god graham this is so
youre not even what you pretend to be youre a lie youre a bigger lie than you ever were
graham sets the camera down though it continues to record
he is visibly upset
all right you want to talk about lies lets talk about lies ann
lets talk about lying to yourself
you havent been able to sleep with your husband because youre no longer in love with him and maybe you never were
you havent been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember
heated yeah youre right
but i never claimed to know everything like you and have all these little theories
im still learning i know that
but i dont feel like ive wasted time
if i had to go through my marriage to get to where i am right now fine
ann moves in closer burrowing her eyes on fire
you have wasted nine years
i mean that has to be some sort of weird record or something nine years
how does that feel
graham says nothing
ann picks up the camera and points it at him
dont do that
thats not good enough
i asked you a question graham
i asked you how does it feel
how does it feel mr
i want to go down on you but i cant
do you know how many people youve sucked into your weird little world
come on how does it feel
i cant tell you like this
im just going to keep asking until you answer
im sure theres plenty of tape
i dont find this turning the tables thing very interesting i dont care
graham reaches up for the camera
ann knocks his hand away
not until i get some answers
tell what you feel
not what you think ive heard plenty of that
what you feel
graham is on the verge of completely falling apart
you want to know
you want to know how i feel
i feel ashamed
is that what you wanted to hear
graham regains his composure somewhat
why are you ashamed
jesus christ ann
why is anybody anything
i think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad and you dont allow for any gray areas and thats what most of us consist
youre not answering me
heated well what kind of answer are you looking for ann
what is it exactly that you want to know
i want to know why you are the way you are
and im telling you its not any one thing that i can point to and say thats why
it doesnt work that way with people who have problems ann its not that neat its not that tidy
its not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count
things just dont happen that way
but why cant you just put it all behind you
cant you just forget it
all that stuff you did
no ann i cant
i cant forget it
its not something i can fix
there s something in my mind
the way my brain works
frustrated god ann when youre with another person and you re
inside them youre so vulnerable youre revealing so much
theres no protection
somebody could say or do something to you while you re in this
and they could hurt you without even knowing it
in a way that you couldnt even see
looks at ann and you would withdraw
to make sure it didnt happen again
ann looks at him for a long moment and then sets the camera down
she moves in front of graham and kneels
i want to touch you
graham shakes his head
i want to touch you
ann reaches out and graham instinctively begins to move away
something in her voice makes him stop
their eyes lock
graham slowly moves back toward her
anns hand eases out to him her eyes still burning into his
graham closes his eyes accepting anns touch
she caresses him
she touches his arms his face his hair
closing her eyes she takes his hand and puts it against her face
she begins to lie him back on the couch
when he offers light resistance she gently persists
keep your eyes closed
graham lies back silently obeying
ann touches his face
gradually her hand slips to his neck and she begins to unbutton his shirt
she watches his face hoping that he will remain calm
she rubs her hand on his chest
once again she brings grahams hand to her face
she moves his hand to her neck and throat painting her skin with his fingers
soon each hand is exploring the other
fingers search for and find hidden areas
their hands remain together and grahams eyes remain closed
ann moves onto the couch with graham
she gently lowers herself into a sitting position on his waist
she slowly moves both of her hands onto grahams chest
they move forward and back like a lazy tide
she looks at graham
his face is tranquil
ann quietly begins to move her face toward his
soon she is hovering inches above him her long hair touching his features
she lowers her lips to his forehead and kisses him
she waits for a negative reaction
getting none she moves lower and kisses his eyes
still receiving no discouragement she moves to his nose
a subtle movement from graham
ann waits for a moment
she then moves to his lips her luxuriant tresses enveloping his face
she kisses him lightly
she kisses him again
graham tilts his head back and she softly kisses his neck
grahams hands make their way up anns back until they have reached her neck
he slowly pulls his face to hers
he kisses her
graham is flooded with warmth and excitement
he caresses her intoxicating himself with physical contact
the kisses become more meaningful and the touching becomes more passionate
for a moment graham seems about to evaporate in a state of ecstasy his eyes filled with relief and happiness
but his gaze happens to fall on the video camera which continues to record
graham seizes up and abruptly backs away from anns embrace
reality slowly envelopes him
ann reaches for his hand
he allows her to take it
almost dazed its okay
graham looks at ann for a long moment
she sees the acceptance and gratitude in his eyes
she smiles lightly
graham moves forward and shuts off the camera
john watching the tape
there is video snow on the monitor now
the tape timer reads
john gets up slowly ejects the tape from the player and heads for the door
graham hearing the footsteps approach backs away from the inlet
his eye is swollen and he holds one of his hands in a curious position
john opens the door
he looks at graham for a moment before reaching into his pocket for grahams keys
he dangles them in his hand as he stands over graham
i never told you this because i thought it would crush you but now i could give a shit
pause i fucked elizabeth
before you broke up
before you were having trouble even
so you can stop making her into a saint
she was good in bed and she could keep a secret
and thats about all i can say about her
john drops grahams keys to the floor and leaves
graham stands fighting back tears and walks into his apartment
he pulls anns tape from the videotape player
he reaches inside the cassette cartridge and pulls the videotape itself out ruining it forever
he does the same to every other tape in both the boxes
he walks over to the camera recorder trailing a mound of videotape behind him
he breaks the lens off the camera body and smashes the inner workings against the edge of the table
he then drops the damaged unit into the pile of destroyed tape where it disappears
john millaney talks to his colleague
man not having to answer to anybody
i feel like this huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders
i mean come on if i decide that id rather live alone whats so bad about that
its not like ive decided to live a life of crime right

john dials a number on his telephone

the intercom clicks off
kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me

john hangs up
he thinks for a moment rubbing his forehead
the intercom clicks to life
on speaker mr
forman is waiting
voice over come on im not asking too much am i
just one little question
cynthia is tending bar
the dude from earlier is still there puffing on a big cigar
just tell me what time you get off
work i mean
whats the harm in that
ann enters the lounge
cynthia watches with apprehensive surprise as ann approaches with a potted plant
to dude excuse me
cynthia moves to meet ann at the end of the bar
ann sets the plant down on the counter
her manner is diffident but not hostile
i know its your birthday and i know you like plants
so i got you this
cynthia is very moved though she struggles valiantly to conceal her emotions
i cant stay
ann begins to leave
can i call you
ann turns back to face her
they look at each other for a moment
do you have my work number
ann writes the number down on a napkin
i get real busy between two and four
ann looks at cynthia again before leaving
cynthia continues to look at the door long after ann has left
cynthia turns to him
do me a favor
dont come in here anymore
graham sits reading
there is now some furniture in the apartment
bookshelves plants etc
there are periodicals on the table where the video gear used to be
there are no cigarettes
there is a knock at grahams door which now has a deadbolt lock
who is it
a knock again
graham sets his book down and goes to the door
he unlocks the deadbolt and opens it
ann stands in the hallway
graham is obviously flushed with feeling at seeing her
she wordlessly moves into the room her movements like a slow breeze her expression calm
graham watches her go by
she stops in the middle of the room her back to him
graham moves toward her slowly
sensing him behind her her breathing becomes deep
graham slowly enfolds her in his arms his face against her hair
she closes her eyes as their fingers entwine
