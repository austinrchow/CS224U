b if window
href b b by matt damon ben affleck the bar is dirty more than a little run down
if there is ever a cook on duty hes not here now
as we pan across several empty tables we can almost smell the odor of last nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor
oh my god i got the most fucked up thing i been meanin to tell you
as the camera rises we find four young men seated around a table near the back of the bar
here we go
the guy holding court is chuckie sullivan and the largest of the bunch
he is loud boisterous a born entertainer
next to him is will hunting handsome and confident a softspoken leader
on wills right sits billy mcbride heavy quiet someone you definitely wouldnt want to tangle with
finally there is morgan omally smaller than the other guys
wiry and anxious morgan listens to chuckies horror stories with eager disgust
all four boys speak with thick boston accents
this is a rough working class irish neighborhood and these boys are its product
you guys know my cousin mikey sullivan
well you know how he loves animals right
anyway last week hes drivin home
trying not to laugh im sorry cause you know mikey the fuckin guy loves animals and this is the last person youd want this to happen to
chuckie what the fuck happened
hes driving along and this fuckin cat jumps in front of his car and so he hits this cat chuckie is really laughing now
that isnt funny and hes like shit
and he looks in his rearview and sees this cat im sorry fuckin chuckie
so he sees this cat tryin to make it across the street and its not lookin so good
its walkin pretty slow at this point
you guys are fuckin sick
so mikeys like fuck i gotta put this thing out of its misery so he gets a hammer out of his tool box and starts chasin the cat and starts
whackin it with the hammer
you know tryin to put the thing out of its misery
and all the time hes apologizin to the cat goin im sorry
bang im sorry
like it can understand
and this samoan guy comes runnin out of his house and hes like what the fuck are you doing to my cat
mikeys like im sorry bang i hit your cat with my truck and im just trying to put it out of its misery bang
and the cat dies
so mikeys like why dont you come look at the front of the truck
cause the other guys all fuckin flipped out about watching his cat get brained
morgan gives will a look but will only smiles
yeah so hes like check the front of my truck i can prove i hit it cause theres probably some blood or something or a tail and so they go
around to the front of his truck
and theres another cat on the grille
is that unbelievable
he brained an innocent cat
the opening credits roll over a series of shots of the city and the real people who live and work there going about their daily lives
we see a panoramic view of south boston
will sits in his apartment walls completely bare
a bed a small night table and an empty basket adorn the room
a stack of twenty or so library books sit by his bed
he is flipping through a book at about a page a second
chuckie stands on the porch to wills house
his cadillac idles by the curb
will comes out and they get in the car
we travel across crowded public housing and onto downtown
finally we gaze across the river and onto the great cementdomed buildings that make up the m
the classroom is packed with graduate students and tom
professor lambeau is at the lectern
the chalkboard behind him is covered with theorems
please finish mckinley by next month
many of you probably had this as undergraduates in real analysis
it wont hurt to brush up
i am also putting an advanced fourier system on the main hallway chalkboard everyone groans
im hoping that one of you might prove it by the end of the semester
the first person to do so will not only be in my good graces but go on to fame and fortune by having their accomplishment recorded and their name printed
in the auspicious m
lambeau holds up a thin publication entitled m
former winners include nobel laureates world renowned astro physicists fields medal winners and lowly m
that is all
a smattering of applause
students pack their bags
the place is a monster indoor funpark
will chuckie morgan and billy are in adjoining batting cages
will has disabled the pitching machine in his and pitches to chuckie
the boys have been drinking
will throws one to chuckie high and tight
several empty beer cans sit by the cage
another pitch inside
youre gonna get charged
you think im afraid of you you big fuck
youre crowdin the plate
will guns another one way inside
stop brushin me back
stop crowdin the plate
chuckie laughs and steps back
caseys bouncin at a bar up harvard
we should go there sometime
what are we gonna do up there
i dont know well fuck up some smart kids
stepping back in youd probly fit right in
will fires a pitch at chuckies head
chuckie dives to avoid being hit
he gets up and whips his batting helmet at will
sean mcguire sits formally dressed on the roof of his apartment building in a beat up lawn chair
well built and fairly muscular he stares blankly out over the city
on his lap rests an open invitation that reads m
class while the morning is quiet and sean sits serenely there is a look about his that tells us he has faced hard times
this is a man who fought his way through life
on his lonely stare we a thirty year reunion party has taken over the lawn
a well dressed throng mill about underneath a large banner that reads welcome back class of
we find professor lambeau standing with a drink in his hand surveying the crowd
he is interrupted by an approaching student
excuse me professor lambeau
im in your applied theories class
were all down at the math and science building
we just couldnt wait till monday to find out
find out what
who proved the theorem
in the bleachers of the visiting section we find our boys drinking and smoking cigarettes
will pops open a beer
the boys have been here a while and it shows
billy sees something that catches his interest
shes got a nice ass
reveals a girl in stretch pants talking to a beefy looking italian guy bobby champa yah that is a nice ass
you could put a pool in that backyard
whos she talking to
that fuckin guinea will knows him
yah bobby champa
he used to beat the shit outta me in kindergarten
hes a pretty big kid
yah hes the same size now as he was in kindergarten
fuck this lets get something to eat
what morgan youre not gonna go talk to her
the boys get up and walk down the bleachers
i could go for a whopper
nonchalant lets hit kellys
morgan im not goin to kellys roast beef just cause you like the take out girl
its fifteen minutes out of our way
what else we gonna do we cant spare fifteen minutes
all right morgan fine
ill tell you why were not going to kellys
its because the take out bitch is a fuckin idiot
im sorry you like her but shes dumb as a post and she has never got our order right never once
shes not stupid
shes sharp as a marble
were not goin
beat i dont even like kellys
lambeau still in his reunion formal wear strides down the hallway carrying some papers
a group of students have gathered by the chalkboard
they part like the red sea as he approaches the board
using the papers in hand he checks the proof
satisfied he turns to the class
this is correct
who did this
lambeau turns to an indian student
nemesh shakes his head in awe
lambeau erases the proof and starts putting up a new one
well whoever you are im sure youll find this one challenging enough to merit coming forward with your identity
that is if you can do it
the street is crowded as our boys drive down broadway
they move slowly through heavy traffic windows down
chuckie sorts through a large kellys roast beef bag as he drives
will holds the wheel for chuckie as he looks through the bag
same tone double burger
chuckie gets out fries for himself hands will his fries
i i had a kellys double burger
would you shut the fuck up
i know what you ordered i was there
so why dont you give me my sandwich
what do you mean your sandwich
i bought it
sarcastic yah all right
how much money you got
i told you i just got change
well give me your fuckin change and well put your fuckin sandwich on layaway
why you gotta be an asshole chuckie
i think you should establish a good line of credit
laughter chuckie goes back searching through the bag
she didnt do it again did she
not even close
did she get my double burger
chuckie whips a fish sandwich back to morgan then to billy
jesus thats really bad did anyone even order a flyin fish
no and we got four of em
you gotta be kiddin me
why do we even go to her
cause fuckin morgans got a crush on her we always go there and when we get to the window he never says a fuckin word to her he never even
gets out of the car and she never gets our order right cause shes the goddamn missing link
well she out did herself today
i dont got a crush on her
push in on will who sees something o
reveals bobby champa and his friends walking down the street
one of them casually lobs a bottle into a wire garbage can
it shatters and some of the glass hits a female passerby who although unhurt is upset
what do we got
i dont know yet
the woman says something to bobby
he says something back
by the look on her face it was something unpleasant
come on will
no why didnt you fight him at the park if you wanted to
im not goin now im eatin my snack
smiles so dont go
will is out of the door jogging toward bobby champa
billy gets out following will with a look of casual indifference
morgan lets go
im serious chuckie i aint goin
leaving the car chuckie opens his door to follow
spins in his seat youre goin
and if youre not out there in two fuckin seconds when im done with them youre next
and with that chuckie is out the door
will comes jogging up towards bobby champa calling out from across the street smiling good naturedly hey bobby champa
i went to kindergarten with you right
sister margarets class
bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure of wills intentions
just when it looks as though bobby might remember him will drills him with a sucker punch which begins the wills momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the hapless
champa out cold
as soon as will hits bobby his friends converge on will
billy jumps in and wrestles one guy to the ground
the two exchange messy punches on the sidewalk
will is in trouble back pedaling dodging punches trying to avoid being overrun
when will goes for one guy another has an open shot and he hammers will with a right hand to the head
will is staggered and bleary as a second guy winds up for a shot he is blind sided by chuckie who hits the kid like he was a tackling sled
lifting him off the ground
chuckie turns to see will still outnumbered
its all will can do to stay standing as morgan drop kicks one of champas boys from the hood of a car
contrary to what we might think morgan is actually quite a fighter
he peppers the kid with a flurry of blows
the fight is messy ugly and chaotic
most punches are thrown wildly and miss heads are banged against concrete someone throws a bottle
in the end its our guys who are left standing while bobbys friends stagger off
chuckie and morgan turn to see will standing over the unconscious bobby champa still pounding him
whatever demons must be raging inside will he is taking them out on bobby champa
he pummels the helpless unconscious champa fury in his eyes
chuckie and billy pull will away
the police finally arrive on the scene and having only witnessed wills vicious attack on champa they grab him
a crowd of onlookers have gathered
chuckie addresses them
hey thanks for comin out
yeah youre all invited over to morgans house for a complementary fish sandwich
the police slam will into the hood of a car
to police hey i know its not a french cruller but its free
the cop holding will slams his wills face into the hood another cop uses a baton to press wills face into the car
the look of rage returns to wills eye
get the fuck off me
another cop comes over
will kicks him in the knee dropping the cop
momentarily freed will engages in a fracas with three cops
more converge on will who though he struggles takes a beating
sean sits exactly as we first saw him except his tie is now loose and an empty bottle of bushmills is at his side
he stares out over the city
a matronly landlady comes out of a doorway on the roof
sean doesnt answer
its getting cold
after a moment she retreats back down the stairs
sean doesnt move
the morning sun reflects brilliantly off the river
will emerges from the courthouse
chuckie is waiting for him in the cadillac with two cups of dunkin doughnuts coffee
he hands one of them to will
this feels routine
whens the arraignment
chuckie pulls away
students walk to class carrying bags
more than any other students seem to be heading into one particular classroom
the classroom is even more crowded than last we saw it
tom takes notes as lambeau plays along with the excited environment with mock pomposity and good humor
is it my imagination or has my class grown considerably
i look around and see young people who are my students young people who are not my students as well as some of my colleagues
and by no stretch of my imagination do i think youve all come to hear me lecture
but rather to ascertain the identity of who our esteemed the tech has come to call the mystery math magician
he holds up the m
tech featuring a silhouetted figure emblazoned with a large white question mark
the headline reads mystery math magician strikes again
whoever you are youve solved four of the most difficult theorems ive ever given a class
so without further ado come forward silent rogue and receive thy prize
the class waits in breathless anticipation
a student shifts his weight in his chair making a noise
well im sorry to disappoint my spectators but it appears there will be no unmasking here today
im going to have to ask those of you not enrolled in the class to make your escape now or for the next three hours be subjected to the mundities
people start to gather their things and go
lambeau picks up a piece of chalk and starts writing on the board
however my colleagues and i have conferred
there is a problem on the board right now that took us two years to prove
so let this be said the gauntlet has been thrown down
but the faculty have answered the challenge and answered with vigor
lambeau comes out of his office with tom and locks the door
as he turns to walk down the hallway he stops
a faint ticking sound can be heard
he turns and walks down the hall
lambeau and tom come around a corner
reveals a figure in silhouette blazing through the proof on the chalkboard
there is a mop and a bucket beside him
as lambeau draws closer reveal that the figure is will in his janitors uniform
there is a look of intense concentration in his eyes
will looks up immediately starts to shuffle off
oh im sorry
whatre you doing
walking away im sorry
lambeau follows will down the hall
whats your name
beat dont you walk away from me
this is peoples work you cant graffiti here
hey fuck you
ill be speaking to your supervisor
will walks out
lambeau goes to fix the proof scanning the blackboard for whatever damage will caused
he stops scans the board again
amazement registers on his face
down the hall we hear the door close
he turns to look for will who is gone
a crowded harvard bar
will and our gang walk by a line of several harvard students waiting to be carded
beat you got fired huh
i got fired
starts laughing how fuckin retarded do you have to be to get shit canned from that job
how hard is it to push a fuckin broom
you got fired from pushing a broom you little bitch
yah that was different
management was restructurin yah restructurin the amount of retards they had workin for them
fuck you you fat fuck
least i work for a livin
to will whyd you get fired
management was restructurin
my uncle can probably get you on my demo team
what the fuck
i just asked you for a job yesterday
i told you no yesterday
after two students flash their ids to the doorman casey our boys file past him
one after another whats up case
with an imperceptible nod casey waves our boys through
a fifth kid a harvard student tries to follow
he is stopped by caseys massive outstretched arm chuckie is collecting money from the guys to buy a pitcher all but morgan cough up some crumpled dollars
so this is a harvard bar huh
i thought thered be equations and shit on the wall
chuckie returns to a table where will morgan and billy have made themselves comfortable
he chuckie spots two attractive young harvard women sitting together at the end of the bar
chuckie struts his way toward the women and pulls up a chair
he flashes a smile and tries to submerge his thick boston accent
hey hows it goin
so you ladies ah go to school here
yeah cause i think i had a class with you
at this point several interested parties materialize
morgan billy and will try as inconspicuously as possible to situate themselves within listening distance
a rather large student in a harvard lacrosse sweatshirt clark notices chuckie
he clark walks over to skylar and lydia nobly hovering over them as protector
this gets will morgan and billys attention
ah history i think
yah its not a bad school
at this point clark cant resist and steps in
what class did you say that was
howd you like that course
good it was all right
it must have been a survey course then
clark notices chuckies clothes
will and billy exchange a look and move subtly closer
history of the world
hey come on pal were in classes all day
thats one thing about harvard never seizes to amaze me everybodys talkin about school all the time
hey im the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar
but as long as youre here i want to seize the opportunity to ask you a question
billy shifts his beer into his left hand
will and morgan see this
morgan rolls his eyes as if to say not again
oh im sure you covered it in your history class
clark looks to see if the girls are impressed
they are not
when clark looks back to chuckie skylar turns to lydia and rolls her own eyes
will sees this and smiles
to tell you the truth i wasnt there much
the class was rather elementary
oh i dont doubt that it was
i remember the class it was just between recess and lunch
will and billy come forward stand behind chuckie
all right are we gonna have a problem
theres no problem
i was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies
my contention is that prior to the revolutionary war the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian precapitalist and
will who at this point has migrated to chuckies side and is completely fed up includes himself in the conversation
of course thats your contention
youre a first year grad student
you just finished some marxian historian pete garrison probly and so naturally thats what you believe until next month when you get to james lemon and get convinced that virginia
and pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in
thatll last until sometime in your second year then youll be in here regurgitating gordon wood about the pre revolutionary utopia and the capital forming effects of military mobilization
taken aback well as a matter of fact i wont because wood drastically underestimates the impact of wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth especially inherited
you got that from work in essex county page right
do you have any thoughts of your own on the subject or were you just gonna plagiarize the whole book for me
clark is stunned
look dont try to pass yourself off as some kind of an intellect at the expense of my friend just to impress these girls
clark is lost now searching for a graceful exit any exit
the sad thing is in about years you might start doin some thinkin on your own and by then youll realize there are only two certainties in life
one dont do that
two you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education you coulda picked up for a dollar fifty in late charges at the public library
will catches skylars eye
but i will have a degree and youll be serving my kids fries at a drive through on our way to a skiing trip
but at least i wont be a prick
beat and if you got a problem with that i guess we can step outside and deal with it that way
while will is substantially smaller than clark he clark decides not to take will up on his wills offer
if you change your mind ill be over by the bar
he turns and walks away
chuckie follows throwing clark a look
morgan turns to a nearby girl
my boys wicked smart
will sits with morgan at the bar watching with some amusement as chuckie and billy play bar basketball game where the players shoot miniature balls at a small basket
in the b
occasionally we hear chuckie shouting larry
when he scores
skylar emerges from the crowd and approaches will
ive been sitting over there for forty five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me
but im just tired now and i have to go home and i wasnt going to keep sitting there waiting for you
and by the way
that guy over there is a real dick and i just wanted you to know he didnt come with us
i kind of got that impression
well look i have to go
gotta get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education
i didnt mean you
heres my number
skylar produces a folded piece of paper and offers it to will
maybe we could go out for coffee sometime
great or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels
when you think about it its just as arbitrary as drinking coffee
laughs okay sounds good
i was trying to be smooth
indicates clock but at twelve fifteen i was gonna come over there and talk to you
see its my life story
five more minutes and i would have got to hear your best pick up line
the caramel thing is my pick up line
glad i came over
our boys are walking out of the bar teasing one another about their bar ball exploits
across the street is another bar with a glass front
morgan spots clark sitting by the window with some friends
there goes that fuckin barney right now with his fuckin skiin trip
we shoulda kicked that dudes ass
will crosses the street and approaches the plate glass window and stands across from clark separated only by the glass
he pounds the glass to get clarks attention
clark turns toward will
clark doesnt get it
will slams skylars phone number against the glass
wills boys erupt into laughter
angle on clark deflated
the boys make their way home piled into chuckies car laughing together
shot of car crossing over the charles st
bridge overtaking a red line train
traveling through narrow back roads in charlestown passing the bunker hill monument
arriving at wills house and dropping him off
lambeau walks into a small garage facility
the area stores lawn machinery and various tools
an older man terry sits behind the desk reading the boston herald sports page
lambeau has obviously never been here before
he takes in the surroundings somewhat uncomfortable
is this the buildings and grounds office
yeah can i help you
im trying to find the name of a student who works here
no students work for me
could you just check because the young man who works in my building which ones your building
terry checks a list behind his own desk
well if something was stolen i should know about it
nothing like that
i just need his name
i cant give you his name unless you have a complaint
please im a professor here and its very important
well he didnt show up for work today
terry takes a beat
holding all the cards
look he got his job through his p
so you can call him
terry goes through a stack of paper on his desk
takes out a card and hands it to lambeau
lambeau looks blankly at the card which reads parole employment program
will stands before judge malone being arraigned
it is fairly unceremonious the courtroom nearly empty save will and the prosecutor
lambeau walks in from the back
there is a lengthy legal precedent your honor going back to whereby a defendant may claim self defense against an agent of the government where the act is shown to
be a defense against tyranny a defense of liberty the judge interrupts to address the prosecutor
simmons officer mcneely who signed the complaint isnt in my courtroom
why is that
hes in the hospital with a broken knee your honor
but i have depositions from the other officers
henry ward beecher proclaimed in his proverbs from plymouth pulpit back in that every american citizen is by birth a sworn officer of the state
every man is a policeman
as for the other officers even william congrave said he that first cries out stop thief is oft he that has stolen the treasure
your honor will cranks it up
to prosecutor i am afforded the right to speak in my own defense by our constitution sir
the same document which guarantees my right to liberty
liberty in case youve forgotten is the souls right to breathe and when it cannot take a long breath laws are girded too tight
without liberty man is a syncope
beat to judge ibid
man is a what
julius caesar proclaimed though he be wounded magna
the judge interrupts
son a beat my turn
the judge opens wills case history
reading june assault sept
grand theft auto february
a beat the judge takes particular notice
where apparently you defended yourself and had the case thrown out by citing free property rights of horse and carriage from
lambeau has to smile impressed
the judge shakes his head
march public drunkenness public nudity assault
impersonating a police officer mayhem theft resisting overturned the judge takes a beat
gives will a look
youre in my courtroom now and i am aware of your priors
beat im also aware that youre an orphan
youve been through several foster homes
the state removed you from three because of serious physical abuse
the judge holds a look to will who looks down
another judge might care
you hit a cop you go in
beat motion to dismiss denied
the bailiff goes to remove will from the courtroom
keep workin on your arguments son
a word of advice for trial speak english
as will is removed from the courtroom lambeau approaches judge malone who is stepping down from the bench
excuse me your honor
offers hand gerald lambeau
an awkward beat
lambeau waits for some sign of recognition
im a professor at m
beat combunatorial mathematics
the judge offers only a blank look
pleased to meet you
do you have a minute
a guard walks will down a hallway toward a group of phones
one call to an attorney
the guard gives will a hard look for a beat
will picks up the phone dials
its will the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar
im sorry i dont recall meeting anyone who fits that description
okay you got me
its the ugly obnoxious toothless loser who got drunk and wouldnt leave you alone all night
i was wondering when youd call
yeah i figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels
sounds good where are you now
you arent by any chance pre law
professor lambeau sits waiting
will is brought in shackled by the guard
gerald lambeau m
fuck do you want
ive spoken with the judge and hes agreed to release you under my supervision
under two conditions
that you meet with me twice a week a beat and you meet with a therapist
if i agree to this i walk right now
ill do the work
im not going to meet with a therapist
now it wont be as bad as it sounds will
beat ive already spoken to one therapist his name is henry lipkin and hes a friend of mine
hes also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field
beat im sure itll be better than spending the next six months in jail
will and chuckie walk up to an enclosed trampoline
billy and morgan prefer to use it for their own version of wrestlemania
as will and chuckie approach billy is on top of a bloodied morgan and has him in the cobra clutch
will and chuckie watch for a beat
billy tightens his grip
being strangled suck my cock
chuckie turns to will conspiratorially as they wait for the fight to finish
whatd you get
you get leniency
probation counselin few days a week
youre fuckin good
just submit morgan
hes got you in the cobra clutch
to chuckie fuck your mother too
will sits alone in his one room apartment reading
a closer look reveals he is reading a self help psychology book
will is flipping through the book at about a page per second
he shakes his head and smiles
upon finishing the book he throws it in a nearby wastebasket
push in on the back of the book where a smiling psychologist is pictured
will sits in a well decorated psychologists office
across from will sits the same psychologist henry lipkin from the book
they are in mid session
thats why i love stock car racin
that dale ernharts real good
now you know will and i know what you need to be doing
you have a gift
i could work the pit maybe but i could never drive like dale ernhart you have a quality something you were born with that you have no control over and
you are in a sense hiding that by becoming a janitor
and im not saying thats wrong
im friends with the janitor that works in my building
hes been to my house for dinner
as a matter of fact i did some free consultation for mike thats not his real name
thats in my book
yeah i read your book
mike had the same problems as chad the stockbroker
the pressures you feel and again i am neither labeling nor judging them are keeping you from fulfilling your potential youre in a rut
so stop the tom foolery the shenanigans will
will your not getting off that easy
no but i mean you know
i do other things
that no one knows about
like what will
i go places i interact
beat like paradise
its not bad
will gives the psychologist a furtive look
its just that feeling when you can take your shirt off and really dance
beat when the music owns you
do you understand
i might understand that
do you find it hard to hide the fact that youre gay
cmon i read your book
i talked to you
its just something i know to be true
thats very presumptuous
buddy two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump
a little laugh well im sorry to disappoint you but im married and i have two children
im sure you do
you probably got a real nice house nice car your books a best seller
youre getting defensive will
i dont care if youre putting from the rough
there are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay alexander the great caesar shakespeare oscar wilde napoleon gertrude stein not to mention danny terrio not
many straight men can dance like that
who is danny terrio
if you wanna hit ramrod take your shot
take some pride in it
you go to church
so fuckin what god loves you
i mean christ
a guy as well known as you
by the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house sunday nights you probably look like inspector clouseau
the psychologist calmly packs his things
well i can see this is pointless
youre getting defensive
and hey chief tell the wife at least
christ set her free
the shrink gets up and walks out
the psychologist comes walking out much to the surprise of lambeau and tom who have been waiting in the lobby
the psychologist keeps walking
you know what gerry
this is why i dont do pro bono anymore
its not worth it to me
i dont have the time
im going on national television this week
wait a minute henry
he henry is out the door
lambeau looks to tom
will is in lambeaus office
lambeau is at the board working on a diagram as tom takes notes
will seems disinterested
this rectangle is subdivided into rectangles
one edge of an inner rectangle is an integer
can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer
its an integer proof
hey look buddy my times almost up
you want me to sit here for an hour and write it out
lambeau says nothing
will gets up and goes to the board
look ill give you the key steps to it but im not gonna do the whole thing
lambeau keeps smiling
that would be a monumental waste of time wouldnt it will
i think so
i happen to know so
lambeau rises and goes to the board
youre thinking too hard
what if i did this
he draws a vertical line through the diagram
now what if i do this
he draws a horizontal line through the diagram
he hands will the chalk
have you ever played checkers
will realizes what lambeau is getting at
in a flash he starts drawing lines through the diagram energized
you color code it
half red half black
if thats an integer lambeau steps in writing with him will
half red half black that
half red half black that edge
the two stop
they are silent for a moment
like two gunfighters after a duel they put down the chalk
checks his watch it would appear we got that proof in under the wire after all
its not how hard you look at things young man its the way you look at them
if you take aim before you fire you will find the most difficult problems become quite literally childs play
will gets his coat
will youve managed to offend four of my colleagues so much that they refused to come back
youre meeting with the leading hypnotist in the country next week and tom and i plan to sit in on the sessions so i expect you to behave appropriately
will sits in a chair across from lambeau and the hypnotist
lambeaus assistant tom takes notes
the hypnotist makes small talk with lambeau who checks his watch
shall we start the uh
yeah when do i get my hypnosis
you guys been talkin for twenty minutes
well get to that
but first why dont you go to sleep for me
he snaps his fingers and instantly wills head goes back and his eyes close
the hypnotist gives lambeau a look
would you mind standing on one leg
will gets up and stands on one leg
lambeau is impressed
will is reclining eyes closed in a trance like state
the mood is more serious now
okay youre in your bed will
now how old are you
and what do you see
somethins in my room
what is it
its like a small figure hoverin over me
youre in a safe place will
its touching me
lambeau makes a sound
the hypnotist shushes him lambeau with his hypnotists finger
tom returns to his note taking
where is it touching you
indicating genitals and im nervous
you dont have to be nervous will
lambeau and the therapist trade looks
this is working
cause im not ready
calming but the figure tells me everythings gonna be all right
cause the figures a libra too
and we start dancin and its beautiful will breaks into song at full volume
getting up oh jesus
the hypnotist gets up and starts heading towards the door
will is still singing from sky rockets
wait a minute barry
i have better ways to spend my time
he is gone
will stops singing laughs
oh for gods sake will
oh come on
youre not pinnin this one on me
he left i wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes
i was havin fun
i told you to cooperate with these people
cmon that guy was a fuckin piece of work
will gets up and adopts a hypnotic persona in front of lambeau
spooky voice look into my eyes
i dont need therapy
get out will
dont forget to get another therapist for next week
will is out the door
lambeau turns to tom
i called mel weintraub this morning to check for availability
whats the point
what do you want to do
there is somebody
who is he
he was my roommate in college
this is sean maguires dying and bereavement class
emblazoned on the door is room
while the lecture hall could hold sixty students there are less than fifteen here today
sean maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone
tired of teaching tired of life he finds himself resigned to the tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student body
establishing trust is the most important component in making breakthroughs with a patient
maureens only response is an empty stare
keep up the good work maureen
vinnie looks up
because trust is an important thing
dont bullshit me vinnie
didnt your brother give you the notes
if a patient doesnt trust you then they wont feel safe enough to be honest with you then theres no point to them being in therapy
its like saying fine come here and dont tell me a thing but go home feeling like youre doing something about your problems and give me my fifty bucks before
you leave will ya
he looks around the room for approval
no one is listening
if you dont help them trust you then theres no way youll ever get them to sleep with you
and that should be the goal of any good therapist
insecure women you know
nail em when theyre vulnerable thats always been my motto
the students look up somewhat stunned
see i got vinnies attention
sean starts to resume his lecture when he notices lambeau standing in the back of the room
there is an awkward moment
to class well it seems were in the presence of greatness
professor gerald lambeau is a fields medal winner
the students stare blankly
the fields medal is the nobel prize for math
beat but its only given out every four years
okay thats all for today
try and get through fernald by monday
the class starts to pack up and file out
lambeau approaches sean who steps down from the lectern
good to see you
good to see you
is there someplace we can talk
will and skylar on their first date
they watch a street magician doing tricks with a rabbit
the guys tricks are pretty good but his on stage persona could use some work
he is incessantly repeating the phrase this is the rabbit the rabbit really does the tricks
will gives skylar a look and they move on
will and skylar walk into the small shop
i dont know it was just kind of the boring suburban thing
private school harvard and now med
beat i actually figured out that at the end of it my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars
i shouldnt have told you that
i bet your parents were happy to pay
i was happy to pay
i inherited the money
is harvard gettin all that money
im leaving in june after i graduate
so you just want to use me and go
well im gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class then go
in that case fine
beat want to see my magic trick
will pulls out a bulging handful of caramels
now im gonna make all these caramels disappear
will goes into all manner of hocus pocus theatrics
then shakes his hand wildly
the trick doesnt pan out and the caramels go flying all over the store
it works better when i have my rabbit
lambeau and sean share a table at this exclusive restaurant
sean seems slightly out of place in his wrinkled sport coat
i didnt see you at the reunion
ive been busy
you were missed
beat how long has it been since weve seen each other
since nancy died
im sorry that damn conference i got your card
a fry cook hands will and skylar a pair of cheeseburgers
have you ever seen annie hall
well theres this part of the movie thats about how theres always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about whats going to happen with the
whole good night kiss thing
i really dont date that much
laughs you know what i mean
i know youve at least thought about it
no i havent
yes you have
you were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss
mock protest no i wasnt
yes you were
i was kinda hopin to get a good night laid but
ill take a kiss
oh you will
i was hoping to get a kiss
then why dont we just get it out of the way
he looks at her
both of them have cheeseburger in their mouths
they kiss mouths full of burger
that had to be the worst good night kiss
hey look lady im just here for the free food
hey i spent all my money on those caramels
lambeau and sean having finished their meal
lambeau has been pitching sean
ive been busy gerry
i got a full schedule
this kids special sean
ive never seen anything like him
not much free time gerry
have you ever heard of a man named ramanujan
sean nods his head
he was alive over a hundred years ago
he was indian
dots not feathers
sean finishes the joke
so this ramanujan lived in a tiny hut in india
no formal education no access to other works
but he came across an old math book and from this basic text he was able to extrapolate theories that had baffled mathematicians for years
and he mailed it to hardy thats right sean
he mailed it to a professor at cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought ramanujan to england
where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age they worked together for the remainder of their lives producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done
ramanujans genius was unparalleled sean
this boy is like that
but hes very defensive and i need someone who can get through to him
i need someone with your kind of background
my kind of background
youre from the same neighborhood
hes from southie
how many people did you try before you came to me
looks squarely at sean five
sean gives a slight knowing smile
barry henry rick
you didnt send him to rick
just meet with the boy once a week
can we do it at my office
that would be fine
the waiter comes with the check
each man reaches for it
i got it
its on the college
establishing shot of the red brick campus
planes land at nearby logan airport
will walks up the steps
seans office is comfortable
books are stacked against the wall
there is a painting on the wall behind sean
sean is seated behind a desk
lambeau sits in a chair in the back of the room next to tom
a long beat passes they wait
any vulnerability he senses hell exploit
ill be okay
its a poker game with this young man
dont let him see what youve got
will walks in
everyone stands to greet will
any trouble finding the place
will this is sean maguire
sean will hunting
sean and will nod
an awkward moment as the four men stand
well lets get started
yeah lets let the healing begin
lambeau is slightly embarrassed
sean smiles at wills joke
would you excuse us
you too gerry
lambeau looks at sean surprised
seans stare is unwavering
after an awkward moment lambeau goes leaving sean and will alone
will doesnt look at sean for more than a second
he seems more interested in the room
there is a long silence as sean watches will
im sean maguire
a smile crosses wills face as he walks to his chair and sits
he lights a cigarette
sean continues to watch him
finally where are you from in southie
did you buy all these books retail or do you send away for like a shrink kit that comes with all these volumes included
have you read all these books will
indicating a shelf how about the ones on that shelf
wills eyes flicker up to the shelf for an instant
yeah i read those
what did you think
im not here for a fuckin book report
theyre your books why dont you read em
that must have taken you a long time
yeah it did take me a long time
sean says this with pride
his determined stare and confident manner catch will a bit off guard
will rises from his chair and goes to the shelf
looking at book a history of the united states volume i
if you want to read a real history book read howard zinns a peoples history of the united states
that book will knock you on your ass
how about noam chomskys manufacturing consent
you people baffle me
you spend all this money on beautiful fancy books and theyre the wrong fuckin books
you think so
whatever blows your hair back
will returns to his chair
indicating cigarette guy your age shouldnt smoke so much
stunt your growth
it really gets in the way of my jazzercizing
sean does not seem at all affected by wills attitude
he remains behind the big desk with almost half a smile on his face
will is aware of seans confidence
do you lift
yes i do
what do you bench
will gets up again and moves around his chair to seans painting
it is a picture of an old sailboat in a tremendous storm by no means a masterpiece
will studies it
you paint this
do you paint
this is a real piece of shit
tell me what you really think
poor color composition lousy use of space
but that shit doesnt really concern me
the color here see how dark it is
i think youre one step away from cutting your ear off
oh starry night time huh
you ever heard the saying any port in a storm
sure how bout still waters run deep well maybe that means you
maybe what mea maybe you were in the middle of a storm a big fuckin storm the waves were crashing over the bow the goddamned mast was about to snap
and you were crying for the harbor
so you did what you had to do to get out
maybe you became a psychologist
maybe you should be a patient and sit down
maybe you married the wrong woman
watch your mouth
thats it isnt it
you married the wrong woman
she leave you
was she bangin someone else
sean is walking slowly towards will
how are the seas now d in a flash sean has will by the throat
will is helpless
if you ever disrespect my wife again
i will end you
will walks out of seans office past lambeau and tom who are sitting in the hallway
at ease gentlemen
sean stands behind his desk in his office still very much on edge
lambeau walks in
five minutes sean
are you okay
a pause sean is staring at his painting
ill understand if you dont want to meet with him again
thursday four oclock
make sure the kid is here
will and skylar sit in the stands watching the dogs run
they ad lib teasing one another about england ireland and america
you grew up around here
not far from here south boston
how was that
pretty boring i guess
i bet you have a great family
you know nothing special
you have a lot of brothers and sisters
do i have a lot of brothers and sisters
well irish catholic
what do you think
you wouldnt believe me if i told you
will shakes his head
will shakes his head
i have twelve big brothers
not a chance
yup youre lookin at lucky thirteen
i swear to god
your house must have been a zoo
it was great
there was always someone to play with give you advice
do you know all their names
course i do theyre my brothers
marky ricky danny terry mikey davey timmy tommy joey robby johnny and brian
laughing do you keep in touch with them
all the time
we all live in southie
i live with three of them now
i want to meet them
well do that
as we pan across seans small apartment we find it strewn with dirty clothes and the sink full of dishes
although if it werent for the clutter the place would feel pretty bare
a framed sports illustrated cover featuring a screaming larry bird and entitled celtic pride hangs on the wall
sean sits at the table next to another nearly empty bottle of bushmills irish whiskey
he is deep in thought
will strolls into the office
sean is waiting there behind his desk
he seems different
will and sean stare at each other for a long moment
how the paintin coming
sean stands up
come with me
sean and will sit in the bleachers at the mostly empty park
they look out over a small pond in which a group of schoolchildren on a field trip ride the famous swan boats
so whats with this place
you have a swan fetish
is this something youd like to talk about
i was thinking about what you said to me the other day about my painting
i stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occurred to me and i fell into a deep peaceful sleep and havent thought about you since
you know what occurred to me
youre just a boy
you dont have the faintest idea what youre talking about
why thank you
youve never been out of boston
so if i asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written
you know a lot about him i bet
lifes work criticisms political aspirations
but you couldnt tell me what it smells like in the sistine chapel
youve never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling
and if i asked you about women im sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites and maybe youve been laid a few times too
but you couldnt tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy
if i asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non fictional material but youve never been in one
youve never held your best friends head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath looking to you for help
and if i asked you about love id get a sonnet but youve never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable
known that someone could kill you with a look
that someone could rescue you from grief
that god had put an angel on earth just for you
and you wouldnt know how it felt to be her angel
to have the love be there for her forever
through anything through cancer
you wouldnt know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the
term visiting hours didnt apply to you
and you wouldnt know about real loss because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself and youve never dared to love anything that much
i look at you and i dont see an intelligent confident man i dont see a peer and i dont see my equal
i see a boy
nobody could possibly understand you right will
yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw
you must know everything about me
youre an orphan right
will nods quietly
do you think i would presume to know the first thing about who you are because i read oliver twist
and i dont buy the argument that you dont want to be here because i think you like all the attention youre getting
personally i dont care
theres nothing you can tell me that i cant read somewhere else
unless we talk about your life
but you wont do that
maybe youre afraid of what you might say
sean stands its up to you
and walks away
will and chuckie doing demo at the site
they throw cinderblocks out a window into a pile
they are filthy
rain pounds south boston
chuckie sits with the cadillac fiddling humming to the radio
morgan and billy sit in the back sharing a case of beer
will is at a pay phone
will hangs up and runs back to the car soaked
whod you call
i didnt have the number
what are you retarded
you went all the way out there in the rain and you didnt have the number
no it was your mothers number
i just ran out of quarters
chuckie pulls away from the curb
why dont we get off mothers i just got off yours
there is a long moment of silence in response to morgans attempt at levity
youre a pretty funny guy
here have a nickel
billy whips his empty beer can off of morgans head
keep fuckin with me
watch what happens
all right then
watch what happens
will sits across from sean completely silent and takes out a pack of cigarettes
will puts the cigarettes away
sean stares at will and occasionally at the clock
sean continues to check the clock on the wall
it is the only clock in the room and it is behind will
their hour is almost up
he is counting seconds
as the second hand crosses the twelve will stands up and walks out leaving sean alone
lambeau and sean walk down the hallway after the session
what do you mean he didnt talk
you sat there for an hour
no he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over
it was pretty impressive actually
why would he do that
to show me he doesnt have to talk to me if he doesnt want to
oh what is this
some kind of staring contest between two kids from the old neighborhood
i wont talk first
chuckie drops will off at his apartment watches him will walk up the steps
chuckie pulls up to the curb and walks up the steps to wills front door
after a beat will emerges
they get back in the car
will and chuckie at work
chuckie shows will how to be a man
the bar is a bit more crowded than usual
will and chuckie walk back to their table carrying beers
they pass a table of girls local regulars getting just as bombed as the guys
these girls are a little overdone
too much make up too much hairspray and too much body for such tight outfits
one of the girls krystyn smiles at will who seems subdued
how you doin krystyn
they pass the table of girls
chuckie looks at one ruefully
i didnt get on cathy last night
i dont know
chuckie turns back to one of the girls calling out cathy
why didnt you give me none of your twat last night
a girl at the table cathy holds up her pinky finger and smiles revealing a mouthful of missing teeth
fuck you and your irish curse chuckie
shes missin teeth will
will nods not really into it tonight
plus its like five to two morgan ends up marryin her
theres only so many times you can bang your friends future wife
they get to the table
wills heart just isnt in it
im takin off
were goin late night
will and lambeau work together at the board
they communicate non verbally as they collaborate on a problem
after a particularly amusing series of numbers they share a look and laugh
will and sean sit in silence
a long moment passes
sean casually reclines in his chair disinterested
will restlessly looks around the room and then back to sean
an odd half smile crosses seans face
after a moment you know i was on this plane once
and im sittin there and the captain comes on and is like well be cruising at feet and does his thing then he puts the mike down but forgets to
turn it off
then he says man all i want right now is a blow job and a cup of coffee
so the stewardess goes runnin up towards the cock pit to tell him the mikes still on and this guy in the back of the plane goes dont forget the
smiles youve never been on a plane
i know but the jokes better if i tell it in the first person
i have been laid you know
you got a lady now
yeah i went on a date last week
howd it go
well are you going out again
i dont know
havent called her
jesus christ you are an amateur
i know what im doing
shes different from the other girls i met
we have a really good time
shes smart beautiful fun
so christ call her up
so i can realize shes not so smart
that shes boring
you dont get it
right now shes perfect i dont want to ruin that
and right now youre perfect too
maybe you dont want to ruin that
will says nothing
well i think thats a great philosophy will that way you can go through your entire life without ever having to really know anybody
sean looks directly at will who looks away
my wife used to turn the alarm clock off in her sleep
i was late for work all the time because in the middle of the night shed roll over and turn the damn thing off
eventually i got a second clock and put it under my side of the bed but it got to where she was gettin to that one too
she was afraid of the dark so the closet light was on all night
thing kept me up half the night
eventually id fall asleep out of sheer exhaustion and not wake up when i was supposed to cause shed have already gotten to my alarms
will smiles sean takes a beat
my wifes been dead two years will
and when i think about her those are the things i think about most
little idiosyncrasies that only i knew about
those made her my wife
and she had the goods on me too
little things i do out of habit
people call these things imperfections will
its just who we are
and we get to choose who were going to let into out weird little worlds
youre not perfect
and let me save you the suspense this girl you met isnt either
the question is whether or not youre perfect for each other
you can know everything in the world but the only way youre findin that one out is by giving it a shot
you sure wont get the answer from an old fucker like me
and even if i did know i wouldnt tell you
you told me every other fuckin thing
you talk more than any shrink i ever met
i teach this shit i didnt say i knew how to do it
you ever think about gettin remarried
my wifes dead
hence the word remarried
my wifes dead
well i think thats a wonderful philosophy sean
that way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone
will is waiting outside the door for someone to come out so he can go in
the door to skylars dorm is partially open
will stands outside while skylar remains on the threshold
where have you been
im sorry i been real busy
you were busy
you know i really was waiting for you to call me
give me another crack at it
let me take you out
you should have called
i have an o chem lab due tomorrow and its impossible
beat its not an excuse dummy
i want to go out with you
but look she holds up her lab
will glances at it
if you bring the caramels
will sits in an outdoor cafe thinking
after a beat he leans over to two students working at a nearby table borrows a pen and paper and starts writing
will is a solitary figure strolling across the lawn
he stops at skylars dorm and knocks on the door
he hands her the paper he was working on
it is her o chem lab
i couldnt wait till tomorrow
how the hell did you do that
didnt your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse in the mouth
im supposed to understand this
youre not going into surgery tomorrow are you
then lets go have some fun
with a smile she relents
sean and will in session
howd the date go
do you still counsel veterans
beat i read your book last night
no i dont
i gave that up when my wife got sick
is that why you didnt write anything else
smiles i didnt write anything else cause nobody including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one
well ive read you colleagues
your book was good sean
beat all those guys were in your platoon
what happened to that guy from kentucky
he got married
he has a kid
i kind of lost touch with him after nancy got sick
do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife
do i wonder if id be better off if i never met my wife
will starts to clarify his question
no thats okay
its an important question
cause youll have your bad times which wake you up to the good stuff you werent paying attention to
and you can fail as long as youre trying hard
but theres nothing worse than regret
you dont regret meetin your wife
because of the pain i feel now
i have regrets will but i dont regret a singel day i spent with her
when did you know she was the one
game six of the world series
biggest game in red sox history me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets
we were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl
what a game that was
tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning in steps carlton fisk hit a long fly ball down the left field line
thirty five thousand fans on their feet screamin at the ball to stay fair
fisk is runnin up the baseline wavin at the ball like a madman
it hits the foul pole home run
thirty five thousand people went crazy
and i wasnt one of them
where were you
i was havin a drink with my future wife
you missed pudge fisks homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met
so wait a minute
the red sox havent won a world series since nineteen eighteen you slept out for tickets games gonna start in twenty minutes in walks a girl you never seen before
and you give your ticket away
you should have seen this girl
she lit up the room
i dont care if helen of troy walked into that bar
thats game six of the world series
and what kind of friends are these
they let you get away with that
i just slid my ticket across the table and said sorry fellas i gotta go see about a girl
i gotta go see about a girl
what did they say
they could see that i meant it
youre kiddin me
no will im not kiddin you
if i had gone to see that game id be in here talkin abouta girl i saw at a bar twenty years ago
and how i always regretted not goin over there and talkin to her
i dont regret the eighteen years we were married
i dont regret givin up counseling for six years when she got sick
i dont regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad
and i sure as hell dont regret missing that damn game
will is impressed
would have been nice to catch that game though
breaking well hell i didnt know pudge was gonna hit the home run
the office is more crowded than usual
tom and three of lambeaus colleagues including the esteemed alexander pekec are in the room
will sits at a work station which projects a proof of his wills onto the chalkboard
lambeau stands beside the projected image at the board arguing with pekec a foreign mathematician
the image is of a ramses graph binary tree
alexander i know your theory
the boy is updating hes strategy stealing
with a ramses graph on the binary tree but what hes doing hes attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex
he can always failsafe to either side maker can
this is not new gerry
pekec starts writing lines beside wills proof on the board
but i can always garbage out writes frantically all the way to n to the minus one
no theres a limit
the limit is not found
turns to will the limit is not found
but i can always go to the other side
there is no proof lambeau can no longer contain himself
maker builds k to the n
n is three to the k times but look i wrote it down
they turn to will who places his proof on the projector
the image is cast over their faces
it reads as pekec reads and the realization dawns on him its just simpler this way
lambeau turns with satisfaction to an understanding pekec
alexander your theory is changed
will and skylar in her room post coital
they are wrapped in a sheet
will is absent mindedly playing the memory game the pattern grows increasingly complex
after a beat why do we always stay here
cause its nicer than my place
ive never seen your place
what about your friends
or your brothers
when do i get to meet them
they dont come over here that much
i think i can make it to south boston
aah its kind of a hike
is it me youre hiding from them or the other way around
all right all right
i dont know
what if i said i wouldnt sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends
reaches for phone its only four in the mornin theyre probly up
you men are shameful
if youre not thinking of your wiener then youre acting on its behalf
then on behalf of my wiener id like to ask for an advance
skylar and will sit together along with wills gang
the boys are considerably drunk but it makes for good entertainment
everyone here is having fun including sylar
will i cant believe you brought skylar here when were all wrecked
whats she gonna think about us
its a real rarity that wed be out drinkin
ive been shit faced for like two weeks
oh great tell her that
now she really thinks were problem drinkers
my uncle marty
will knows him
that guy fuckin drinks like youve never seen
one night he was drivin back to his house on i statie pulls him over
guys tryin to walk the line but he cant even fuckin stand up and so my uncles gonna spend a night in jail
just then theres this fuckin boom like fifty yards down the road
some guys car hit a tree
some other guy
yeah he was probably drunker than my uncle who fuckin knows
so the cop goes stay here and he goes runnin down the highway to deal with the other crash
so my uncle martys standin on the side of the road for a little while and hes so fuckin lit that he forgets what hes waitin for
so he goes fuck it
he gets in his car and drives home
so in the morning theres a knock on the door its the statie
so my uncles like is there a problem
and the staties like i pulled you over and you took off
and my uncles like i never seen you before in my life i been home all night with my kids
and staties like let me get in your garage
so hes like all right fine
he takes around the garage and opens the door and the staties cruiser is in my uncles garage
no he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home
fuckin lights and everything
did your uncle get arrested
the fuckin trooper was so embarrassed he didnt do anything
the fuckin guy had been drivin around in my uncles car all night lookin for the house
everyone is laughing
skylar speaks above the din
there was this irish guy walking down the beach one day
she has everyones attention
will is nervous
and he comes across a bottle and this genie pops out
the genie turns to the irishman and says youve released me from my prison so ill grant you three wishes
the irish guy thinks for a minute and says what i really want is a pint of guiness that never empties
a bottle appears
he slams it down and lo and behold it fills back up again
c u of will
hoping the joke pans out
well the irish guy cant believe it
he drinks it again and again boom
it fills back up
so while the irish guy is marveling at his good fortune the genie is getting impatient because its hot and he wants to get on with his freedom
he says lets go you have two more wishes
the irish guy slams his drink again it fills back up hes still amazed
the genie cant take it anymore
he says buddy im boiling out here
what are your other two wishes
beat the irish guy looks at his drink looks at the genie and says
i guess ill have two more of these
the gang erupts with laughter
its a good thing no ones irish here
chuckie will look at morgan baffled
everyone is walking out saying good bye
chuckie goes over to will and skylar
im glad you came by changed my opinion of harvard people

chuckie heads towards will to say goodnight
i dont know what the fuck youre doin
youre givin us a ride
what do i look like al cowlins

morgan mumbles something and staggers off
billy follows with an indifferent shrug

just cause you dont have to sleep in the one room palace dont start thinkin youre bad
to will i thought you said youd show me your place
yeah not tonight

he knows once you see that shit hole hes gettin dropped like a bad habit
i wanted to meet your brothers
chuckie gives will a curious look
theyre all sleepin now
a beat to chuckie let me get those keys
a cocktail party is underway
professors mingle with representatives from high tech companies
lambeau stands holding a drink and surrounded by several recruiters
apparently hes the star of the show
what i want to know gerry is when we get to meet this wonder boy
were still working together the boys a little rough
weve got our share of eccentric geniuses at tri tech
we know how to deal with that
i think we all do
if youre not exaggerating gerry was i exaggerating in nineteen eighty four when i told you id win the fields medal within two years
in that case the boy could run shipping for us routing you say he doesnt have a diploma but well i dont need to see a drivers license
i can think of three departments right now that he could head up for us
at ease gentlemen
were looking carefully at all our options
all right gerry
close to the vest
gives him his card good luck with these vultures
he walks off
timmys tap is a local watering hole not unlike the l street bar
sean is at the bar telling a joke to timmy the owner of the place and several other regulars
so she goes runnin up the aisle and i figure fuck it and i yell out dont forget the coffee
the men erupt in laughter
marty one of the regulars pipe up
you didnt say that
timmy and sean exchange a look
jesus christ marty
its a joke
lambeau enters a bit overdressed in his sport coat and tie
any trouble finding the place
not at all
timmy this is gerry an old friend of mine
we went to college together
good to meet you
pleasure to meet you
could we get a couple of sandwiches
beat smiles put it on my tab
sean heads towards a table
you ever plan on payin your tab
pulls out lottery ticket i got the winning numbers right here
whats the jackpot
i dont think thatll cover it
lambeau follows sean
youre here quite a bit then
i live right around the corner
i been here a couple years
there is an awkward moment
you wanted to talk about will
seems like its going well
i think so
well have you talked to him at all about his future
we havent really gotten into it
maybe you should
my phones been ringing off the hook with job offers
jobs doing what
cutting edge mathematics
the kind of place where a mind like wills is given free reign
thats great gerry that theres interest but im not sure hes ready for that
sean i really dont think you understand what dont i understand
timmy comes over with the sandwiches
excuse me timmy
could you help us
were trying to settle a bet
have you heard of jonas salk
yeah cured polio
youve heard of albert einstein
gives him a look
how about gerald lambeau
ever heard of him
okay thank you timmy
so who won the bet
this isnt about me
im nothing compared to this young man
beat sean in there were hundreds of professors who were renowned for their study of the universe
but it was a year old swiss patent clerk doing physics in his spare time who changed the world sean
can you imagine if einstein had given that up
or gotten drunk with his buddies in vienna every night
all of us would have lost something
and im quite sure timmy never would have heard of him
isnt that a little dramatic gerry
this boy has that gift
he just hasnt got the direction
we can give that to him
he married his cousin
had two marriages both trainwrecks
the guy never saw his kids one of whom i think ended up in an asylum possible unabomber addition you see sean
thats exactly not the point
no one remembers that
they i do
well youre the only one
this boy can make contributions to the world
we can help him do that
take it easy gerry
look i dont know what else i can say
im not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boys life
but its important to start early
i was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty three years to do something worthy of a fields medal
maybe he doesnt care about that
sean this is important
and its above personal rivalry now wait a minute gerry no no you hear me out sean
this young man is a true prodigy personal rivalry
im not getting back at you
look you took one road and i took another
is it gerry
cause i dont think its fine with you
give him time to figure out what he wants
thats a wonderful theory sean
it worked wonders for you
lambeau gets up
sean i came here today out of courtesy
i wanted to keep you in the loop
as we speak the boy is in a meeting i set up for him over at tri tech
three well dressed tri tech executives sit around a conference table which is littered with promotional brochures
the executives exchange a confused look
one of them speaks
tentative well will im not exactly sure what you mean weve already offered you a position
cut to reveal chuckie sitting across from the executives hair combed down wearing his sunday best
since this is obviously not my first time in such altercations let me say this chuckie rubs the tips of his fingers together indicating cash
the executives are baffled
look we can do this the easy way or the hard way
the executives are completely blank
at the current time i am looking at a number of different fields from which to disseminate which offer is most pursuant aid to my benefit
a beat what do you want
what do i want
what does anybody want
im not sure these circumstances are mitigated
chuckie puts his hands up as if getting a vibe from the room
chuckie points to the third executive
he knows what im talking about
the third executive is baffled
nobody in this town works without a retainer
you think you can find someone who does you have my blessin
but i think we all know that person isnt going to represent you as well as i can
will our offer starts you at eighty four thousand a year plus benefits
you want us to give you cash right now
allegedly what i am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if i had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now
the executives exchange looks and go for their wallets
i dont think i
i have about seventy three
will you take a check
what do you think i am a juvenile
you dont got any money on you right now
you think im gonna take a check
its fine john i can cover the rest
thats right you know
turns to he knows
chuckie stands up and takes the money
to exec youre suspect
i dont know what your reputation is but after the shit you tried to pull today you can bet ill be looking into it
any conversations you want to have with me heretofore you can have with my attorney
gentlemen keep your ears to the grindstone
will and skylar sit in the open courtyard of this harvard square eatery
skylar is working on another o chem lab
will sits across from her slightly bored watching her work
hows it goin
want me to take a look
cmon give me a peek and well go to the battin cages
its important that i learn this
why is it important to you
if i inherited all that money the only thing important to me would be workin on my swing
what do you have to worry about
i have an inheritance
its two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
thats exactly what itll cost me minus about five hundred bucks to go all the way through med school
this is what im doing with that money
i could have done anything i wanted
i could have expanded my wardrobe substantially
instead youre going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke
no so i can be a doctor
she looks down then up
all right mr
let me ask you a question
do you have a photographic memory
i dont know
how do you remember your phone number
have you ever studied organic chemistry
some a little
just for fun
i guess so
nobody does organic chemistry for fun
especially for someone like you
someone like you who divides his time fairly evenly between the batting cages and bars
how did you do that
i mean even the smartest people i know and we do have a few at harvard have to study a lot
beat listen will if you dont want to tell me do you play the piano
come one will
i just want to know
im trying to explain it to you
so you play the piano
when you look at the keys you see music you see mozart
i see hot cross buns but okay
well all right beethoven
he looked at a piano and saw music
the fuckin guy was deaf when he composed the ode to joy
they had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldnt hear the crowd going crazy behind him
he saw all of that music in his head
so do you play the piano
not a lick
i look at a piano and i see black and white keys three pedals and a box of wood
beethoven mozart they looked at it and it just made sense to them
they saw a piano and they could play
i couldnt paint you a picture i probably cant hit the ball out of fenway park and i cant play the piano but you can do my o chem lab
in under an hour you can when it came to stuff like that i could always just play
skylar is awestruck with admiration for will the robot pimp
so much so that skylar has to kiss him then push him away
i cant believe its taken me four years to meet you and im going to california in two months will
beat have you ever been to california
i bet youd like it
chuckie sits on his couch watching cartoons in his boxers and a tee shirt eating cereal
the doorbell rings
get it ma
he gets up
how you doin
an awkward beat
howd you know where to find me
smiles you were the only sullivan in the phone book
will and i dropped you off here remember
this is your house right
chuckie nods and is about to respond when he is interrupted by a nagging shriek from his mom
get in here chuckie
calling back pipe down ma
i guess so
this is my mothers house
i dont live with my mother
i just stop by help out
im good like that
is this a bad time
beat if she starts yelling again i might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but
lets take a walk
chuckie still in his boxers walks with skylar who is talking
see now this doesnt feel right
beat when i made the decision to come over here it felt right
i had all these rationalizations
i just dont understand why will never tells me anything he wont let me get close to him he tells me these weird lies you caught that huh
i just wanted to find out what was going on
but now that im here it seems strange doesnt it
well i dont have no trousers on
i know why youre here
will dont talk much
i dont care what his familys like or if he doesnt have any brothers but he doesnt have to lie to me
i really dont know what to say
look i lie to women all the time
thats just my way
beat last week morgan brought these girls down from roslindale
i told them i was a cosmonaut
they believed me
but wills not usually like that put some clothes on sullivan
take it easy father
all i can say is i known will a long time and i seen him with every girl hes ever been with
but ive never seen him like this before ever with anyone like how he is with you
is that true
yeah it is
tom and will are sitting waiting for lambeau
lambeau enters going over a thick proof will has completed
this is correct
i see you used mclullen here i dont know what its called
this cant be right
examining proof this is going to be very embarrassing
have you ever considered im pretty sure its right
will gets up to leave
turning back can i ask you a favor can we do this at seans from now on
cause i leave work to come here and the fuckin commute is killin me thats fine but did you ever think its right
a beat heading out take it home with you
will what happened at the tri tech meeting
i couldnt go cause i had a date
so i sent my chief negotiator
will on your own time you can do what you like
when i set up a meeting with my associates and you dont show up it reflects poorly on me
then dont set up any more meetings
ill cancel every meeting right now
ill give you a job myself
i just wanted you to see what was out there
maybe i dont want to spend my life sittin around and explaining shit to people
the least you can do is show me a little appreciation
indicates proof you know how fuckin easy this is to me
this is a joke
crumples proof and im sorry you cant do this
i really am
cause if you could i wouldnt be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up
sure then youd have more time to sit around and get drunk
think of how many fights you could have been in by now
will turns around reveling that hes lit the proof on fire
will drops it on the floor
lambeau drops to his knees and puts it out
he looks up at will
youre right will
i cant do that proof and you can
and when it comes to this there are only twenty people in the world that can tell the difference between you and me
but im one of them
well im sorry
so am i
thats right will
most days i wish i never met you
because then i could sleep at night
i wouldnt have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there
and i wouldnt have to watch you throw it all away
lambeau gathers his composure and calmly walks over to the wrinkled proof
he picks it up smooths it out
will and skylar lie in bed
skylar watches will sleep
she gets up and goes to the fridge
returning to the bed will
are you awake
come with me to california
i want you to come with me
how do you know that
i just do
yeah but how do you know
i dont know
i just feel it
and youre sure about that
yeah im sure
cause thats a serious thing youre sayin
i mean we might be in california next week and you could find out somethin about me that you dont like
and you might feel like hey this is a big mistake
getting upset but you cant take it back cause you know its real serious and you cant take somethin like that back
now im in california cause you asked me to come
but you dont really want me there
and im stuck in california with someone who really doesnt want me there and just wishes they had a take back
what is that
i dont want a take back
i want you to come to california with me
i cant go out to california
one because i have a job here and two because i live here beat look will if youre not in love with me you can say that
im not sayin im not in love with you
then what are you afraid of
what do you mean what am i afraid of
why wont you come with me
what are you so scared of
what am i scared of
well what arent you scared of
you live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and youre scared shitless to do anything else dont tell me about my world
youre the one thats afraid
you just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry is that what you think some prick from stanford that your
parents will approve of
then youll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin too
i inherited that money when i was thirteen when my father died
at least you have a mother
you think i want this
that moneys a burden to me
every day i wake up and i wish i could give that back
id give everything i have back to spend one more day with my father
but thats life
and i deal with it
so dont put that shit on me
youre the one thats afraid
what the fuck am i afraid of
youre afraid of me
youre afraid that i wont love you back
and guess what
im afraid too
but at least i have the balls to it give it a shot
at least im honest with you
im not honest
what about your twelve brothers
oh is that what this is about
you want to hear that i dont really have any brothers
that im a fuckin orphan
is that what you want to hear
i didnt even know that
no you dont want to hear that
yes i do will
you dont want to hear that i got cigarettes put out on me when i was a little kid
that this isnt surgery
will lifts his shirt revealing a six inch scar on his torso
you dont want to hear that
dont tell me you want to hear that shit
yes i do
did you ever think that maybe i could help you
that maybe thats the point that were a team
what you want to come in here and save me
is that what you want to do
do i have a sign that says save me on my back
i dont want to save you
i just want to be with you
i love you
i love you
will full of self loathing raises his hand to strike her
dont bullshit me
dont fuckin bullshit me
standing up to him you know what i want to hear
i want to hear that you dont love me
if you tell me that then ill leave you alone
i wont ask any questions and i wont be in your life
will looks skylar dead in the eye
lowers his hand
i dont love you
he walks out
will leaves pulling on his clothes
will sits across from two n
agents oliver dytress and robert tavano
these guys are smug clean cut gung ho and looking sharp in twin navy blue suits
so why do you think i should work for the national security agency
well youd be working on the cutting edge
youd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldnt see anywhere else because weve classified it
super string theory chaos math advanced algorithms codebreaking
thats one aspect of what we do
come on thats what you do
you handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload
youre seven times the size of the c
thats exactly right will
so the question as i see it isnt why should you work for n
its why shouldnt you
why shouldnt i work for the national security agency
thats a tough one
will bites his tongue trying to make this work
chuckie billy and will sit in the sullivan kitchen
billy cracks open a beer and chuckie reads the sports page
both boys are smoking
will drinks a beer distractedly
we hear the faint music track and soft moans of a porno movie emanating from a back room
after a beat chuckie looks up
morgan if youre watchin pornos in my moms room again im gonna give you a fuckin beatin
after a beat morgan comes out of the back room red faced
innocently whats up guys
why dont you beat off at your house
i dont have a vcr at my house
will pays no attention to this exchange will is on pay phone talking to skylar
i just wanted to call before you left
beat im takin all these job interviews
so i wont just be a construction worker
i never cared about that
an awkward beat
i love you will
pause no take backs
will says nothing
will hangs up
hold on him for an agonizing beat
lambeau is scribbling away at work
tom is taking notes
will is tapping his fingers waiting for him to finish
im almost there
skylar stands at the gate carry ons in hand
her flight is boarding
she looks for will over the crowd
will picks up a frame from seans desk
it is carlton fisks baseball card
will has to smile
lambeau looks up
what are you smiling at
its a carlton fisk baseball card
will can see that lambeau wants more
you follow baseball
the final boarding call is announced and the last passenger boards
after a beat skylar turns and gets on the plane
will holding the card reflects for a beat and puts it down
oh well its just somethin sean told me
its a long story
you all set
ive got the first part
the rest i can do at home
will gets up
will the n
has been calling me just about every hour
theyre very excited about how the meeting went
lambeau is excited
will clearly is not
will sits across from sean
so you might be working for uncle sam
i dont know
gerry says the meeting went well
what did you think
what did i think
will has obviously been stewing on this
say im working at n
somebody puts a code on my desk something nobody else can break
so i take a shot at it and maybe i break it
and im real happy with myself cause i did my job well
but maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in north africa or the middle east
once they have that location they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people i never had a problem with get killed
rapid fire now the politicians are sayin send in the marines to secure the area cause they dont give a shit
it wont be their kid over there gettin shot
just like it wasnt them when their number got called cause they were pullin a tour in the national guard
itll be some guy from southie takin shrapnel in the ass
and he comes home to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from
and the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job cause hell work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks
meanwhile my buddy from southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price
and of course the oil companies used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick buck
a cute little ancillary benefit for them but it aint helping my buddy at two fifty a gallon
and naturally theyre takin their sweet time bringin the oil back and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink seven and sevens and
play slalom with the icebergs and it aint too long til he hits one spills the oil and kills all the sea life in the north atlantic
so my buddys out of work and he cant afford to drive so hes got to walk to the job interviews which sucks cause the shrapnel in his ass is
givin him chronic hemorrhoids
and meanwhile hes starvin cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue plate special theyre servin is north atlantic scrod with quaker state
so whatd i think
im holdin out for somethin better
i figure ill eliminate the middle man
why not just shoot my buddy take his job and give it to his sworn enemy hike up gas prices bomb a village club a baby seal hit the hash
pipe and join the national guard
christ i could be elected president
do you think youre alone
do you have a soul mate
someone who challenges you in every way
who takes you places opens things up for you
a soul mate
shakespeare neitzche frost oconnor chaucer pope kant theyre all dead
not to me theyre not
but you cant give back to them will
not without a heater and some serious smelling salts no
thats what im saying will
youll never have that kind of relationship in a world where youre afraid to take the first step because all youre seeing are the negative things that might happen ten
miles down the road
youre going to take the professors side on this
dont give me your line of shit
i didnt want the job
its not about that job
im not saying you should work for the government
but you could do anything you want
and there are people who work their whole lives layin brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have
what do you want to do
i didnt ask for this
nobody gets what they ask for will
thats a cop out
why is it a cop out
i dont see anythin wrong with layin brick thats somebodys home im buildin
or fixin somebodys car somebodys gonna get to work the next day cause of me
theres honor in that
youre right will
any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will
be empty is an honorable man
will says nothing
and when they get drunk and puke in the sink they dont have to see it the next morning because of you
thats real work will
and there is honor in that
which im sure is why you took the job
i just want to know why you decided to sneak around at night writing on chalkboards and lying about it
beat cause theres no honor in that
will is silent
something you want to say
sean gets up goes to the door and opens it
why dont you come back when you have an answer for me
if you wont answer my questions youre wasting my time
will loses it slams the door shut
sean has finally gotten to will
who the fuck are you to lecture me about life
you fuckin burnout
wheres your soul mate
sean lets this play out
possible shepard change
she dies and you just cash in your chips
thats a fuckin cop out
i been there
i played my hand
and you fuckin lost
and some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again
look at me
what do you want to do
will looks up
you and your bullshit
you got an answer for everybody
but i asked you a straight question and you cant give me a straight answer
because you dont know
sean goes to the door and opens it
will walks out
will and chuckie take crowbars to a wall
this is what they do for a living
as they routinely hammer away will becomes more involved in his battle with the wall
plaster and lathing fly as will vents his rage
chuckie noticing stops working and takes a step back watching will
will is oblivious
lambeau and tom are in his office
will is nowhere to be seen
lambeau is on the phone
what i mean sean is that im sitting in your office and the boy isnt here
beat well its ten past three
beat an hour and ten minutes late
beat well if he doesnt show up and i have to file a report saying he wasnt here and he goes back to jail it wont be on my conscience
he hangs up
tom picks up a form up off the desk
what should i do
the boy was here
he came in sat down and we worked together
a blank look
he came in sat down and we worked together
tom understands begins filling out the form
will walks out carrying a brown bag
he is filthy having just knocked off work
chuckie is sitting on the hood of his cadillac watching will across the street
chuckie is covered in grime as well
will starts walking towards chuckie
as he draws closer he heaves a can of budweiser a good thirty yards to chuckie who handles it routinely
will takes a seat next to chuckie and they crack open their beers
other workers file out of the site
hows the woman
she went to medical school in california
beat i dont know what to tell ya
you know all the girls i been with
you been with em too except for cheryl mcgovern which was a big mistake on your part brother
oh im sure thats why only one of us has herpes
some shows are worth the price of admission partner
this gets a small laugh from will
my fuckin back is killin me
a passing sheet metal worker overhears this
thats why you shoulda gone to college
suck my crank
fuckin sheet metal pussy
beat so when are you done with those meetins
week after im twenty one
are they hookin you up with a job
yeah sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years
yah but its better than this shit
at least youd make some nice bank
yeah be a fuckin lab rat
its a way outta here
what do i want a way outta here for
i want to live here the rest of my life
i want to be your next door neighbor
i want to take out kids to little league together up foley field
look youre my best friend so dont take this the wrong way but in years if youre livin next door to me comin over watchin the fuckin patriots games and
still workin construction ill fuckin kill you
and thats not a threat thats a fact
ill fuckin kill you
chuckie what are you talkin
listen you got somethin that none of us have
why is it always this
i owe it to myself
what if i dont want to
you owe it to me
tomorrow im gonna wake up and ill be fifty and ill still be doin this
and thats all right cause im gonna make a run at it
but you youre sittin on a winning lottery ticket and youre too much of a pussy to cash it in
and thats bullshit cause id do anything to have what you got
and so would any of these guys
itd be a fuckin insult to us if youre still here in twenty years
you dont know that
let me tell you what i do know
every day i come by to pick you up and we go out drinkin or whatever and we have a few laughs
but you know what the best part of my day is
the ten seconds before i knock on the door cause i let myself think i might get there and youd be gone
id knock on the door and you wouldnt be there
you just left
now i dont know much
but i know that
lambeau stands across from sean seething
this is a disaster
i brought you in here to help me with this boy not to run him out now wait a minute and confuse him gerry and here i am for the
second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake hold on
ready to falsify documents because youve given him license to walk away from this
i know what im doing and i know why im here
look sean i dont care if you have a rapport with the boy i dont care if you have a few laughs even at my expense
but dont you dare undermine what im trying to do here
he has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility
and you dont understand that hes at a fragile point he is at a fragile point
hes got problems what problems does he have sean that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with why do you think he does
he can handle the work he can handle the pressure and hes obviously handled you
why is he hiding
why is he a janitor
why doesnt he trust anybody
because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most
oh come on sean and why does he hang out with his friends
because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to
its called loyalty
oh thats nice and who do you think hes handling
he pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him
and for years hes been alone because of that
and if you try to push him into this its going to be the same thing all over again
and im not going to let that happen to him
now dont do that
dont you do that
dont infect him with the idea that its okay to quit
that its okay to be a failure because its not okay
if youre angry at me for being successful for being what you could have been im not angry at you yes you are sean
you resent me
and im not going to apologize for any success that ive had
i dont have any anger at you yes you do
youre angry at me for doing what you could have done
ask yourself if you want will to feel that way for the rest of his life to feel like a failure
thats why i dont come to the goddamn reunions
because i cant stand the look in your eye when you see me
you think im a failure
i know who i am
im proud of who i am
and all of you you think im some kind of pity case
you with your sycophant students following you around
and your goddamn medal
is that what this is about sean
the fields medal
do you want me to go home and get it for you
then will you let the boy i dont want your trophy and i dont give a shit about it
cause i knew you when
you and jack and tom sanders
i knew you when you were homesick and pimply faced and didnt know what side of the bed to piss on
you were smarter than us then and youre smarter than us now
so dont blame me for how your life turned out
its not my fault
i dont blame you
its not about that
its about the boy
cause hes a good kid
and i wont see this happen to him wont see you make him feel like a failure too
he wont be a failure
if you push him into something if you ride him youre wrong sean
im where i am today because i was pushed
and because i learned to push myself
hes not you
lambeau turns something catches his eye
sean turns to look its will
he is standing in the doorway
i can come back
no thats fine will
i was just leaving
there is an awkward moment as lambeau gets his coat and leaves
well im here
beat so is that my problem
im afraid of being abandoned
that was easy
look a lot of that stuff goes back a long way
and its between me and him and it has nothing to do with you
do you want to talk about it
will sees a file on seans desk
oh this is your file
i have to send it back to the judge with my evaluation
youre not going to fail me are you
so whats it say
you want to read it
beat have you had any experience with that
twenty years of counseling you see a lot of no have you had any experience with that
smiles it sure aint good
from a childs p
we see a man partially obscured by a doorframe
the man turns toward the p
after a pause my dad used to make us walk down to the park and collect the sticks he was going to beat us with
actually the worst of the beatings were between me and my brother
we would practice on each other trying to find sticks that would break
he used to just put a belt a stick and a wrench on the kitchen table and say choose
a large callused hand sets down a wrench next to a stick
gotta go with the belt there
i used to go with the wrench
the wrench why
cause fuck him thats why
a long quiet moment
is that why me and skylar broke up
i didnt know you had
do you want to talk about that
beat i dont know a lot will
but let me tell you one thing
all this history this shit
indicates file look here son
will who had been looking away loos at sean
this is not your fault
nonchalant oh i know
its not your fault
smiles i know
its not your fault
its not your fault
dead serious i know
its not your fault
dont fuck with me
comes around desk sits in front of will its not your fault
tears start i know
crying hard i know i know
sean takes will in his arms and holds him like a child
will sobs like a baby
after a moment he wraps his arms around sean and holds him even tighter
we pull back from this image
two lonely souls being father and son together
will rides the red line above ground
he looks out over the landscape
small back yards laundry hangs from wire lines
chainlink fences overgrown with weeds
will walking through south boston
he cuts through a park
a senior citizen is spearing trach for the city
will at home
looks up at the ceiling
will walks up to a nondescript building he walks through the glass doors into the lobby
will walks into the lobby
a security guard looks up
can i help you
yeah my name is will hunting
im here about a position
the guard reaches for the phone

chuckie turns to will

laughter as the boys converge on will
he goes willingly out the door
as they come out the door rather than beating will mercilessly they stop
morgan goes into his own personal rendition of danny boy
no one joins in

chuckie indicates an old chevy nova parked illegally in front of the bar

sean pulls out his lottery ticket
they start out down the hall
on their backs as they walk down the hall
sean do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery
i dont know
gotta be at least four to one
about thirty million to one
youre pretty quick with those numbers
how about the odds of me buying the first round
about thirty million to one
will sits alone thinking
we hold on him for an extended beat until he gets up and walks away
begin final sequence
a wide establishing shot of seans apartment complex as the sun is setting
the lights are on in one unit
a tighter shot reveals sean in his apartment packing his belongings in cardboard boxes
the camera cranes down from seans window and onto the street where we pan to reveal will sitting in his car and looking up at sean as he packs his
wills car is packed full of clothes and books
chuckie and the boys drive down the street in the cadillac
morgan and billy ride in the back leaving the shotgun seat open for will
will holds an envelope which he slips in seans mailbox
he puts the flag up and smiles as he looks up at sean in his apartment who is still unaware that will is there
chuckie pulls up in front of wills house
he honks the horn waits a beat then gets out and heads toward the house
will drives away from seans house
sean hears the car pull out and looks out the window
sean sees wills car pulling away
curious he investigates
chuckie walks up wills front steps
sean walks out to the sidewalk and looks around
seeing the mailbox flag has been raised he walks over to it
chuckie knocks on wills front door
there is no answer
he waits a beat looks in the window
an incredulous smile slowly starts to form
sean opens the card will left for him
it reads in writing sean if the professor calls about that job just tell him sorry i had to go see about a girl
chuckie walks back towards his car unable to contain the broad smile
he knows will is gone
he shrugs in explanation to the guys
morgan takes wills seat as they pull away from the curb
we pan up from the letter to sean
a broad smile comes over him
this is a look we havent seen
sean is truly happy
will is on the road driving away
as we pull back and credits roll the car disappears into the horizon
