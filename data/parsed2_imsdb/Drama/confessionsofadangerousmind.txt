a screenplay by charlie kaufman based on an unauthorized biography by chuck barris third draft revised may this film is a reenactment of actual events
it is based on mr
barriss private journals public records and hundreds of hours of taped interviews
a cab speeds down a dark bumpy side street
looking in his rearview mirror the cab driver checks out his passenger a sweaty young man in a gold blazer with a p insignia over his breast pocket
several paper bags on the back seat hedge him in
the young man is immersed in the scrawled list he clutches in his hand
a passing street light momentarily illuminates the list and we glimpse a few of the entries double coated waterproof fuse feet ammo hollowpoint configuration potato chips lays
an excerpt from the gong show reenacted
the video image fills the screen
we watch a fat man recite hamlet punctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises
the audience is booing
eventually the man gets gonged
chuck barris age hat pulled over his eyes dances out from the wings to comfort the agitated performer
whyd they do that
i wasnt done
i dont understand
juice whyd you gong this nice man
not to be
that is the answer
the studio audience laughs
the cab sloshes to a stop in front of a liquor store
the young man gets out jogs through the rain toward the fluorescent storefront
the cab driver waits listens to staticky reports in a foreign language on his radio
the meter is running
the back seat is piled high with bags
chuck barris spastically dances on the screen along with gene gene the dancing machine
barris turns to the camera points at it
well be right back with more stuff
the back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes
the cab stops
the young man gets out and confers with a shady looking guy on the corner
the young man pulls out a big wad of cash
money and a small package change hands
the meter in the cab is at thirty five dollars and change
chuck barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog
the audience howls with glee
suddenly the video image explodes
slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot toward the camera
we pull back to reveal were in a darkened messy hotel room
we pan across the walls past taped up yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like gong show a new low in television the dumbing of america and chuck barris is the
decline of western civilization
we come to rest on a naked middle aged man crouching in the shadows in the corner holding a gun
this is chuck barris
the television continues to sputter spark and smoke
there is a knock at the door
naked barris still holding the gun seems panicked
he hesitates trying to determine his options
should he answer the door
should he climb out onto the window ledge
finally he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for a long moment
he unlocks the door opens it
the sweaty young man a bellhop stands there with his many bags
he tries to appear casual as takes in the sight a naked chuck barris holding a gun an exploded smoking tv set in the background
weakly more stuff
yes sir mr
everything you requested
except i couldnt find a
consults list dh directional fragmentation mine
well its late
mumbling and bowing but thank you
thank you for trying
you are a scholar and a
barris trails off gives a quick glance both ways down the hall then motions for the bellhop to enter
the bellhop places the bags on a table fishes in his pocket and pulls out some bills
you are a scholar and a
barris trails off
eyes averted thank you sir
suddenly barris becomes agitated
why are you not looking at me like that
do i look ugly to you
runs to the mirror its the not sleeping
im not sleeping see
i have a lot on my
barris trails off
there is a pause
the bellhop attempts to make conversation
re exploded tv um another gong show rerun sir
the naked barris approaches the bellhop drapes his arm over the young mans shoulder and walks with him
conspiratorially you know what id do
and dont tell anybody id rub
id rub alpo brand dog food on my dick so the dogs would stick their noses into my
guaranteed big laugh right
that was my trick my great contribution to the world
how wouldnt i degrade myself i ask you
there is a silence
screaming i ask you
i dont know sir
suddenly barris punches himself in the head flops down on the unmade bed
the bellhop glances at barriss bare ass looks away
barris maybe if you just dont watch the show every night you wouldnt have to i always pay for the damn tvs dont i
turning to face him dont i
its yes you do sir and we appreciate that its just that thereve been complaints from some of the other guests and mr
andrews the assistant manager requested that i still
i specifically used the silencer this time
well the people in found a bullet lodged in their wall
and while we want to accommodate you we certainly value your patronage there is an issue of customer safety
barris lets this sink in
yes of course
barris finds his pants draped over a chair pulls out his wallet holds some more money out to the bellhop
buy is it
buy them a magnum of your finest champagne
and your finest spackle
oh and get me a bag of plastic army men while youre out
i forgot to tell you before
the bellhop sighs takes the money
thank you for your understanding sir
the bellhop exists
calling after and some black socks
seven black socks you rascule
barris locks the door dumps the contents of the bags onto the floor fishes through the mess for a cigar puts the cigar in his mouth studies himself in a
full length mirror
bellhop johnson was clearly repulsed by the sight of me
and why not
searches for simile then proudly like a prune
covered in liver spots
searches for simile like an old guy
my hair is falling out in clumps leaving exposed patches of white sickly scalp
a flabby inner tube of fat hangs from my waist practically obscuring my bedraggled prick dark and shriveled and dead
still leaking urine even though i left the toilet ages ago
my asshole itches
george orwell said every man has the face he deserves by fifty
does every man have the asshole he deserves by fifty as well
does every fifty year old asshole have the asshole he deserves
this feels real verite
the actual chuck barris smoking a cigar is being interviewed
he stands outside his villa in st
tropez older than the middle aged barris depicted in the hotel room and talks to someone off camera
i had holed myself up in this new york hotel
terrified of everything
ashamed of my life
what do you mean
barris walks through a small vegetable garden as he talks occasionally adjusting a stake or pulling out a weed
when youre young your potential is infinite
you might do anything really
you might be great
you might be einstein
you might be goethe
then you get to an age where what you might be gives way to what you have been
you werent einstein
you werent anything
thats a bad moment
but i remembered something carlyle wrote
there is no life of a man faithfully recorded but is a heroic poem of its sort rhymed or unrhymed
i realized my salvation might be in recording my wasted life unflinchingly
maybe it would serve as a cautionary tale
maybe it would help me understand why
barris now in a hotel terrycloth bathrobe and a porkpie hat sits at a desk and types manically
my name is charles prescott barris
i have written pop songs i have been a television producer
i am responsible for polluting the airwaves with mind numbing puerile entertainment
in addition i have murdered thirty three human beings
i am damned to hell
three year old chuck dressed somewhat girlishly and sporting a blonde pageboy haircut is being posed on a pony by a photographer
his mother stands by anxiously as the boy totters on the animal
born in philadelphia pennsylvania in my early childhood remains accessible to me only as a series of elliptical enigmatic memories
a smiling butcher hands a slice of bologna to young barris who puts it in his mouth
the taste of bologna fresh from the butcher
a baby doll is set afire
young barris dances around it
the sickly sweet smell of a burning babydoll on a crisp autumn day
young barris is being dressed by his mother
were close on the velvet material being slipped over his head
velvet brushing against my tender young skin as my mother dressed me
young barris rolling on the ground in battle with another boy as a crowd of children look on
a constant inarticulate rage leading to fist fight after fist fight
young barris watches dust motes lit by the early morning sunlight pouring through his bedroom window
the calm i felt watching dust suspended in the early morning sunlight
young barris sits on the floor and watches the shadow of a man walking upstairs
the young boy is clearly terrified
i remember fear
toddler barris watches his mother change clothes
he studies her pendulous breasts
she looks down smiles warmly
you like the way mommy looks chuckie
i bet you would like to be a mommy some day wouldnt you
his mother lifts the little boy to her breasts and presses his face against them
he is in heaven
four year old chuck sits at the dining room table with several other four year olds
they all wear party hats
barriss father a milquetoast middle aged man enters in birthday hat carrying a cake decorated with four lit candles
he leads the children in happy birthday dear chuck as young chuck beams
chuck glances at the kitchen doorway
his mother stands there staring at him
she dressed in black mourning clothes complete with veil
young chuck peeks in as his mother sits in a rocking chair and holds barriss infant sister
she fusses with the bows and frills on the babys outfit
the light in the room is golden and warm
we move in on the little boys devastated face then follow him as he turns and walks down the hall into darkness
a sixteen year old barris lies on his back on a couch lazily tossing a football in the air
tuvia a thirteen year old girl sits on the floor playing with a puppy
in the background throughout the scene we hear the inept playing of scales on a bass violin
when i was sixteen i had an experience with my little sisters friend tuvia that left an indelible impression
phoebes no walter page huh tuvia
i dont know who that is
of course you dont
beat why are you waiting around anyway listening to this cacophonous cacophony when you could be in your own abode disrupting the lives of your own siblings
i dont know what anything you say means
you wouldnt would you
barris watches tuvia playing with the dog
she gets on all fours and yelps imitating the dog
this excites the dog who bounces around her
barris studies tuvias exposed white underwear for a while
this excites barris
finally he pulls an afghan off the back of the couch and drapes it over his pants
we hear him unzip his fly
not looking what
turning wha at
tuvia sees barris fiddling with something under the afghan
she gets quiet
you wanna lick it
tuvia snorts goes back to playing with the dog
why should i
well for one thing it tastes like strawberry
my sister tells me you love strawberries
i hate strawberries
honestly a mans penis tastes exactly like a strawberry lollipop
look i know thats not true so it is true
its weird but its true
i just read a research paper on it
tuvia looks at the afghan
middle aged chuck barris turns from the typewriter and stares out the window at the dark night sky
sadly wistful my first love
tuvias face jerks up into frame
it doesnt taste anything like strawberry you creep
the dog sticks his head under the afghan
barris shoos him away
curious well what does it taste like
tuvia gets up
yknow im gonna tell your mother what you just did
if you do ill tell your mother you made our dog lick your crack
i did not
shrugging so what
middle aged barris types as the camera glides over some of the acquired detritus in his room skin magazines a gun and silencer liquor a copy of beyond good and
evil a disguise kit a kids sprouted lima bean science fair project
perhaps my whole life turned at that point
the repulsiveness of my sex confirmed by the tastebuds of a ripening pubescent girl
sequence of young barris unsuccessfully attempting to pick up girls at bars unsuccessfully attempting to cop a feel on a date in a movie theater standing on a front porch
unsuccessfully attempting to kiss a girl good night standing outside of a movie theater in the rain holding an umbrella over his head and checking his watch
and so i found myself in a downward spiral of debauchery
endlessly chasing pussy
my only focus in life to get laid to get blown trying to fool myself into believing that given the right combination of circumstances and deception maybe the tuvias of
the world could desire me the way i desired them
i only wanted to be loved
barris is fighting another drunken guy
hes getting pummeled
a constant inarticulate rage led to bar fight after bar fight
the two men get tossed from the bar
the other guy gets up brushes himself off orients himself and after a moment starts beating barris again
subtitle new jersey turnpike a bus drives along
we see from the sign above the windshield that it is bound for new york
young barris age in traveling clothes and red hunting cap stares out the window
as much as i tried i couldnt understand my past and my present was miserable so at twenty four i decided what i needed was a future
young barris suitcase in hand looks up at the impressive building
people hurry by
i had heard that television was an industry with a future
barris enters the building with resolve
young barris age dressed in an nbc blazer is leading a group of sheep like tourists down a hall
next well have a look at the studio where they produce the today show
the tourists ooooh
another tour group comes around a corner
this one is led by georgia a perky blonde southern girl
the two groups squeeze past each other
chuck tries to make eye contact with georgia
he smiles at her but she ignores him
barris is at the cash register paying for his food
he looks around for a place to sit
he spots georgia sitting with a female friend and he sits at a table behind so as to listen unobserved to their conversation
that fella raymond in payroll is kinda cute huh
cutes all well and good mary ann but what you want is a man whos goin places
a go getter on the management fast track
barris registers this information
barris stands at the counter talking to a female clerk

about two thousand
for how many positions
looking up and smiling five
barris sitting with a book and copying the names of three of the board of directors of rca onto his application under the heading of personal references

she climbs on top of barris and begins kissing him all over

barris sits drunkenly at the bar

but then i remembered something carlyle said do the duty which lies nearest thee
dear god why do i even bother
hey fuck you you condescending prick

the guy punches barris
a fight ensues
barris is drunk on the couch watching a tv game show his face swollen from the fight
pissy looks like i was just late
barris barely acknowledges this continues to watch tv
barris and georgia are in bed
georgia is asleep
barris opens his eyes quietly climbs out of bed
another verite looking interview
a middle aged blonde woman the actual georgia is talking to someone off camera

i woke up and he was gone
i never saw him again
until that stupid tv show he did
the gong show
i know what its called jerk
were close on a copy of the ny herald tribune
the headline reads clark testifies before payola committee
we pull back to see young barris in a suit reading the paper in a passenger car of a moving train
in i was thirty
i had become a minor suit at abc
it was during the music payola scandal
american bandstand is taping
the studio is filled with dancing teens
barris sits off to one side behind an imposing desk in the semi darkness suspiciously watching dick clarks every move and taking copious notes
clark glances over nervously
so my job was to commute to philly every day to the american bandstand tapings and keep an eye on dick clark
the actual dick clark is being interviewed
he spooked me
i tried to keep on his good side becuase he was sort of
i dunno there was something in his eyes
something dark like unbridled ambition maybe
or an inarticulate rage
barris walks through the crowds
a dark look in his eyes as he follows some giggling teenage girls in poodle skirts
on weekends i used to hang around amusement parks
because thats where the young girls were
young barris lies in bed masturbating
i wrote a song about my experience
the song palisades park begins
last night i took a walk after dark to see a place called palisades park to have some fun and see what i could see thats where the girls are
a sign above the stage reads the dick clark saturday night beechnut show
freddie cannon is on stage singing palisades park as a crowd of teenagers dance on the studio floor
i got it to freddie boom boom cannon through my friendship with dick clark
dick really wanted to help me out
i took a ride on the shoop de shoop that girl i sat beside was awful cute and when we stopped she was holding hands with me my heart was
flying up like a rocket ship down like a roller coaster fast like a loop de loop round like a merry go round
young barris watches happily from behind the cameras
he spots debbie a pretty bland young woman with headphones and a clipboard
he sidles over to her
i wrote this song
its number three on the pop charts
barris pulls out music magazine clipping as proof
barris and debbie are having dinner

there is a long awkward silence
they both saw away at their steaks
barris and debbie are having sex sort of mechanical
theyre plowing through kind of like sawing through their steaks
when its over they both just lie there
young barris in his underwear sits alone in the semi darkness and stares out the window
the front door unlocks and a woman enters backlit from the hallway
she turns on the light
this is penny pacino eighteen a beatnik in a black leotard and skirt and black mascara
she has red hair
she sees barris on the couch

penny walks past him drops her keys and bag on the counter and enters the kitchenette
barris watches her ass

penny returns with two beers hands one to barris
she sits in a chair across from him
they both drink

penny exits into her bedroom
barris drinks his beer
barris and penny are having sex on the kitchen floor
its quite passionate
penny is taking a bath in the tub in the kitchen while barris broodingly cooks dinner at the stove
animatedly so this ape and i were looking at each other
it was like across time and evolution

leonard goldberg abc executive sits behind his desk as barris holding a cardboard model of a game show set excitedly paces the room giving a pitch
i call it the dating game mr

a pretty girl asks three handsome guys who she cant see silly questions
and based on their answers she picks one to date

penny leans on a signpost smoking a cigarette
barris emerges from the building with his cardboard set

staring off was anyone ever so young
barris lies on his bed on his back and tosses the football in the air
a very very very old dog lies on the floor
phoebe barriss year old sister enters

youre breaking moms heart

barris looks out the window at his emaciated mother sitting in the yard in an old wicker backed wheelchair and staring off into space
somehow and dont ask me why phoebe my being born broke moms heart
barris watches his mother for a long moment
hey phoebe you ever see whats her name tuvia anymore
i heard something
i think she got divorced recently or something
barris knocks on the door
there is some movement inside and a woman answers the door
this is older tuvia s attractive but a little hard edged now
she balances a baby on her hip yes
registers well if it isnt strawberry dick barris
barris taken by the changes in tuvia
the baby and the full milk producing breasts get him excited

she closes the door
he knocks again
she opens the door
well if it isnt strawberry dick barris

for a while
i thought maybe you and i could jesus youve got to be kidding
tuvia closes the door
barris stands there for a moment considers knocking again then turns and leaves
we move along a park bench past several homeless people one holding an old doll others holding other sad items
we come to barris
hes wrapped in a horse blanket and holding the miniature cardboard dating game set
an open notebook sits on his lap
the pages are blank except for one entry the something else game
barris holds a pen poised to write but doesnt
barris is drunk and in a fight
he is losing flailing swinging wildly
jim byrd a middle aged business man looking guy in tinted glasses and sideburns watches from the bar
eventually barris and the other brawler get thrown out of the bar
byrd takes a sip of his drink
barris sits on the curb nursing his wounds
byrd exits the bar and casually approaches
youre a pretty angry young fella arent you
cant fight worth a damn though
screw off fag
dont think i havent seen you watching me in that bar for a week now
kind of a loner id say
a tad anti social
mad at the world

barris gets up and starts to walk away
i could teach you at least thirty different ways to kill a man with a single blow mr
might help you in future bar fights
just a thought
barris just stands there
oh and theres money in it
barris and jim byrd sit in a booth
barris is wolfing a hamburger
byrd sips coffee

the work we do is very serious
its essential in quelling the rise of communism and allowing democracy to gain its rightful foothold around the globe
the place is ramshackle and overgrown
it looks deserted
a barbed wire fence surrounds it
a severe looking instructor is teaching a class to an assembled group of scary looking men losers psychos mercenaries latin american thugs and chuck barris
there are several efficient methods of killing a man were you to find yourself without a weapon
the edge of your hand against the adversarys adams apple
demonstrates on mannequin this will crush the windpipe causing strangulation and death
the students take notes
boxing your adversarys ears with proper force will cause his ear drums to burst and possibly result in bleeding in the brain
byrd sits on a step smoking a cigarette
youre training me to be a killer

i cant kill people
my future is in television
listen youre thirty two years old and youve achieved nothing
jesus christ was dead and alive again by thirty three

barris lifts his hands tries to remember

byrd rises stubs out his cigarette in his hand

barris sits there staring into the blackness
another big frightening instructor stands before the class
behind him is a full sized diagram of a man which illustrates all major arteries and organs
he is demonstrating the proper way to grip a knife then using the knife he points to various sites on the body
angle on chuck barris
he has copied the diagram of the man in his notebook and is writing carotoid artery carries blood to brain

barris and other students are assembling rifles
barris and other students crawl on their bellies through mud
the severe instructor in a lab coat is mixing chemicals

the students nervously pour nitric acid into beakers
the severe instructor is demonstrating how to use an army field telephone to torture a man
a canvas dummy is tied to a chair as the instructor attaches wires from the telephone to the dummys genitals and to his mouth
the students watch closely take notes

the end of summer camp
a tearful barris heads toward one of the waiting buses
byrd pulls him aside discusses something with him
byrd and barris now dressed in a suit similar to byrds sit in first class

rendas in the back between barris and benitez
renda seems pale and nervous as does barris in his gaudy tourist wear and sunglasses
the car drives slowly through the crowded mexico city streets
they arrive at a jammed intersection and are suddenly confronted with a big parade
its day of the dead the streets are filled with dancing skeletons
its wild and frightening
brazioni glances at renda in the reaview mirror
day of the dead
the car stops in a deserted field
barris gets out first
his shirt is soaked through with sweat
suddenly theres a commotion inside the car
renda has gotten hold of a gun
he shoots brazioni and benitez
barris panics and dives behind the car
renda steps cautiously outside of the car looking for barris
barris grabs rendas foot
renda falls the gun flies from his hand
barris kicks the gun under the car his own gun drawn
he points the gun at renda who is on his stomach
barris doesnt shoot
hes scared shaking wildly
renda looks up at barris trying to figure him out
he slowly rises to his feet turns to barris with a pleading look in his eyes
no me mates senor
tengo tres bebes
barris sucks in a deep gulp of air
his hand shakes
he pulls out spansh english dictionary
no me mates
tengo tres bebes
barris flips through the dictionary
a church bell chimes startling barris
his gun goes off accidentally and the bullet hits renda in the face tearing most of it away
renda falls but is still alive
he screams out of where his mouth was
a wedding party emerges from the distant church
barris tries to stop renda from screaming by covering the hole in rendas face
barris throws up some of it landing on rendas pants
he wipes his own mouth with his bloody hand and looks at the still screaming renda
the churchgoers are starting to squint in barriss direction
barris shoots renda again
and again and again and again and again
more blood spatters barriss clothing and face
the church bell continues to chime
barris and byrd sit side by side in first class
this time barris has the window seat and stares out
beautiful country isnt it
you did us proud chuck
barris doesnt say anything
renda was a bad guy
he really was
barris enters carrying an overnight bag and some mail
he flips on the hall light and stares at himself in a mirror
i had changed
i could see it in my eyes
barris notices a fleck on the side of his nose
its dried blood
he distractedly rubs at it
rendas contorted face in close up as he is shot
echoey church bells chime
no me mates
yo tengo tres bebes
barris puts down his bag pulls the spanish english dictionary from his pocket and tries to translate what renda said
it takes him a while but he does
dont kill me
i am three babies
i am three babies
what the fuck does that mean
studies dictionary oh
i have three babies
barris drops to the floor and throws up into a trash can
out of the corner of his eye he catches a movement in the living room
he lurches backwards knocks over the can
vomit spills onto the carpet
groggily chuck is that you throwing up
in the dim light from the hallway barris spots penny lying on the couch
she is dressed as a hippy
a backpack and a duffel lie on the floor next to her
jesus christ penny
you scared the shit out of me
what are you doing here
i just been crashing here for a few days
waiting for you
where you been man where you been
just on a little vaca
you drank the water didnt you
youre not supposed to
youre not even allowed to open your mouth or your eyes when you take a shower
how come our water is so good and their water is poison
its the same ocean
i dont know
its weird huh
beat then proudly so im a hippy now
penny stands in the dimness to show off her outfit
ive been in san francisco and its amazing
everybody loves everybody and theres lots of colors
were gonna change the world chuck
come back with me and be my old man okay
not that old
ha ha ha
penny im a little tired now so
you gotta hear this song
penny shrieks excitedly as she runs to the record player
she turns it on plugs in a strobe light
sunshine superman starts up
penny sings and dances along directing the lyrics at barris
barris looks around at his strobing apartment
he sees pennys mess pot paraphenalia anti war posters a gold dove painted on the wall with a phone number underneath
singing cause i made my mind up youre going to be mine
penny what did you do to my wall
looking oh its a guy who called a couple a days ago
isnt it pretty
dials phone anxiously hello this is chuck barris returning for leonard goldberg
penny sings and dances in background
im so sorry i didnt get back to you right away
i was out of town
vacationing in mexico
good for you
weve ended up with a damn hole in our daytime schedule
ive been reviewing some options and it occurred to me there might be a place here for you and your baby
my baby mr
the dating game
joshingly that is your baby isnt it chuck
yes sir it is
are you still interested
well need to start airing in about six weeks
is that do able for you and your people
keep me posted
barris sits there phone in hand then throws up again into the trash can
penny stops dancing watches
damn mexicans and their water
an episode of the show is being taped
barris paces nervously behind the camera
bachelor number two what would i like most about you
i am very romantic and i would send you flowers every day
the studio audience awwws
bachelor number three what would i like most about you
my big cock
the bachelorette makes a mock horrified expression as the studio audience erupts in laughter
barris buries his face in his hands
a brunette bachelorette asks a question
bachelor number one what nationality are you
well my father is welsh and my mother is hungarian so i guess that makes me well hung
the audience goes wild
barris pulls at his hair
a black bachelorette asks a question
bachelor number three i play the trombone
if i blew you what would you sound like
the audience screams with delight
leonard goldberg a bunch of network executives and barris sit around a conference table and watch a tv
on it is the dating game
a black bachelor is responding to the trombone question
he simulates the receiving of a blow job moaning and writhing in his seat as the studio audience howls
barris has his head in his hands
goldberg signals an assistant who switches off the television
the executives look quite grim
chuck quite frankly these episodes are unairable
look len the shows spontaneous its unscripted
thats its charm
i cant control what people say
be that as it may mr
barris we cant have black men getting blow jobs on national television
the point isnt that hes black hank
beat well i know that
thats not what i meant
look len nobody is indifferent to these shows
and thats good
show business must avoid indifference at all costs
even when taste is involved
taste is just a word
you dont fuck with taste my friend
uncomprehending what does that even mean
i dont even under
chuck we cannot air this stuff
if you cant figure out how to retain your spontaneity without the contestants being lewd were going to have to pull the show
barris is drunk and brooding
he picks a fight with a big man who has unintentionally knocked into him at the bar
barris is brutal and effective utilizing the techniques he learned from one of the scary instructors at training camp
this gives him an idea
the contestants are onstage
barris appears warm and charming
before we begin taping today id like to introduce you to mr
peter jenks of the federal communications commission
the severe training camp instructor joins barris onstage
increasingly psychotic thank you mr
i dont know if any of you are aware of this but its a federal offense to make licentious remarks on a network television broadcoast
the penalty for this disgusting un american behavior is one year in prison or a ten thousand dollar fine or both
anyone making a sick subversive remark tonight will be arrested immediately
i will then personally escort the offender to federal prison for booking under edict number of the broadcast act of
and its a long drive to that prison
just you and me
no other witnesses jumping in any questions
there are none
the contestants are paralyzed with fear
jenks is red faced trembling
have fun everybody
the actual barris being interviewed
sometimes as a younger man i stretched the truth to get what i wanted
through all the lying days of my youth i swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun now i may whither into the truth
you heard of him
sure you have
beat anyway my little lie worked
we aired and become a big hit
a phenomenon really
this is the sixties and the office is crazily appointed
street signs funny posters faux tiffany lamps mobiles lava lamps an inflatable sex doll etc
barris is behind his desk feet up and on the phone
he wears a t shirt and jeans and loafers
this is a new barris confident and successful and hip and relaxed and slovenly
outside in the bullpen area we hear the hustle and bustle laughing and screaming of a busy but casual office
into phone terrific rod
yeah ill get back to you on monday
barris hangs up the phone
his jovial facade disappears
he opens up his ice bucket
loretta barriss pretty young secretary enters with a new bucket of ice
she is braless and shoeless
jesus barris take a darvon
loretta drops the bucket of ice on his desk
barris grabs her arm pulls her toward him kisses her on the back of the neck
loretta acts annoyed but its playful
talk to me
loretta sighs and drops into a bean bag chair
barris puts some ice in a glass and pours himself a scotch
were in the middle of a bachelorette crisis out there
i just got a call from the network
you got any weed
then ill have a drink
barris pours a drink for loretta
she gets up takes it off the desk and falls back down into the bean bag
the tammy grimes show is being pulled from saturday night
mock concern oh my god
they want to put a prime time version of the dating game on in its place
thats fucking great
but they say the day time versions not hot enough
they want me to make it more exciting for night time
i got forty eight hours
what do you have so far
i mean the show is what it is
i dont have a clue
this could be my big break loretta
yeah i know
dont blow it
loretta smiles at him downs her drink gets up and pads out of the office
barris watches her ass
thank you for your help
not looking back hey i brought the ice
she is out the door
barris picks up his guitar and noodles on it
barris paces on the darkened set
he is trying to think
a shadowy figure appears at the top of the bleachers and creeps down the aisle
barris is deep in thought and doesnt hear
the man appears behind barris and locks his arm around barriss neck
barris is startled choking and flailing trying to remove the arm
finally the man releases barris and tweaks his crotch
barris turns wildly around
it is jim byrd
boy didnt i teach you anything
you son of a bitch
barris swings at byrd
byrd easily blocks the punch
youre so rusty its embarrassing
youre a stupid fucking turd you know that
can i buy you lunch
jim is downing his bourbon and signals the waitress for another
barris still pissed sips a martini
ah lighten up hombre
my fucking neck hurts
look ive been put in charge of a fairly large wet operation and i could use your help
have you noticed jim ive got a tv show on the air
i dont need to kill people for hire anymore
i know you dont need to
but youd like to
byrd shrugs unconvinced
he sips his drink
think of it as a hobby
something you do to relax
you can be an assassination enthusiast a murder bug
ive got important things to think about here
i dont have time to fuck around with you
okay ill help you out with your little show
tit for tat
thats the kinda guy i am
ive seen this dating game of yours chuck
and i have a thought
what now youre a television producer

well what do you have now
the couple gets sent to some stupid second rate hollywood shitcan restaurant right
sets you back fifty bucks
thats not too exciting a prize to us vicarious living boobs out in tv land
yeah whats your point
up the stakes chuckles
send em to some exotic locale
europe southeast asia for example
the networks not going to let me send two unmarried kids on vacation together
shrugs send em with a chaperone
some respectable old lady with a sewn closed snatch
considering yknow thats not half bad
im telling ya
and sometimes you can be the chaperone chuckie
lets say we have a job for you in austria
you a successful tv producer above suspicion chaperones the young couple and while youre there blam
you take care of some company business
its the perfect cover
tv producer by day cia operative by night
i told you i dont have to kill people for money anymore
chuck when i said you fit our profile very little of that had to do with you needing the money
some of it but very little
you liked it with renda chuck
i saw it in your eyes
you liked it but you botched it
dont you want to get really good at something chuck
barris stares at byrd
the director calls the shots
barris stands in the back watching the show in progress
on the stage is a pretty blonde bachelorette in a short black dress and three bachelors
bachelors two and three are attractive and stylishly dressed and groomed
bachelor one is a fat not too bright looking guy in a yellow ochre leisure suit
his slow unfocused delivery contrasts with the fast sharp chatter in the booth
rapidly ready one take one
ready three take three
ready one take one
number one can you please tell me what a girl is like who hasnt been on a date before and how you can tell she hasnt been on a date
ready two take two
this guy has never been on a date
everyone in the booth laughs
jesus shes gotta pick this guy
this is just too good
ill ask her what she likes to do and ready one take one
ready two take two
and if she doesnt know what she likes to do ready three take three
the only date hes ever had is with his right hand
guys in booth laugh except barris
then ill know she hasnt done it yet
its all mod and colorful
chuck barris shuffles along taking in the sights with the dating game couple
the blonde bachelorette did indeed pick the fat guy
but its clear she thinks she made a mistake and pays him no attention whatsoever walking about twenty feet in front of him and barris
barris seems bored
barris enters the pub alone
hes dressed in a blonde wig and moustache and glasses
its crowded and he searches the room for someone
he spots a pretty young woman by herself at a table
she wears white go go boots
excuse me is this seat taken
barris sits across from the woman
london is wonderful this time of year isnt it
yes it is
barris gets up glances around spots another pretty young woman in white go go boots sitting by herself
he approaches her
excuse me is this seat taken
london is wonderful this time of year isnt it
especially the fog
it affords one solitude even in a city full of people
yes i gathered
and you are
smiles here you go chuck
she hands him a manila envelope and stands to leave
at least give me a made up name
something for me to cry out during those dark nights of the soul
cry out olivia
thats twelfth night
very good chuck
im pleasantly surprised
youre not like the other murderers
she smiles and leaves
barris watches after her then opens the envelope and pulls out a black and white photo of a man
a bored barris dressed normally waits with the fat bachelor under an umbrella near the entrance
the fat bachelor checks his watch
i thinks hes really pretty and i want to be her boyfriend
barris in wig and moustache stands in the middle of the empty dark courtyard
loud whisper here
do you have it
do you have it
barris reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out an envelope
the englishman takes it opens it pulls out a wad of cash and counts
dont worry were not gonna cheat you
just the same
the englishman finishes counting the money pockets it and hands barris a box of polaroid film
oh one more thing
barris pulls out his automatic with attached silencer and jams it into the englishmans mouth
the silencer breaks the mans front teeth
the man makes a muffled grunt
sorry about your teeth
the englishmans eyes are wide with terror
barris pulls the trigger three times
the back of the englishmans head explodes
blood and hair and brain are spattered against the church wall
the englishman slumps to the ground
barris reaches into the mans jacket pulls out the envelope of money pockets it and makes his way toward the churchyard gate
there stands the fat bachelor watching confused
after the initial shock barris smiles warmly
its ronnie isnt it
the fat bachelor nods
i want to show you something neat
the fat bachelor enters the courtyard
i felt bad about ronnie
but really i did that ugly fat stupid kid a favor
he was ugly and fat and stupid
more life wouldnt have changed that for him
no woman would ever have loved him
thats just the brutal truth yknow
barris enters the room shaky and scared
barris rips open the polaroid box pulls out the foil paper that protects the film rips that open and pulls out a small white plastic vial
barris greases the vial with vaseline and sticks it up his ass
he looks at himself in the mirror naked and pathetic
there is a knock at the door
he stiffens grabs his gun and pads out of the bathroom
barris peeks out the peephole
we see a fish eye view of patricia watson
its patricia actually
barris and patricia sit sipping champagne
both are drunk
and so then i spent a year in operation chaos inside the anti war movement as an agent provocateur nudging it toward violence in order to discred it
that was fun
i got to wear granny glasses
so tell me patricia whyd you come up here tonight
i dont know
youre sort of cute in a homely way
and its always lonely when that civilian youre fucking calls out the name off your fake passport
all the information i have about myself is from forged documents
barris is thrilled and kisses her
it begins to turn hot and heavy
suddenly barris pulls away
actually i just gotta go into the bathroom and take care of something
leave the microfilm in
a plane lands
barris waits sweatily in line with a small a carry on suitcase
when the line moves he walks as if perhaps he has something up his ass
a customs agent walks past the line with a dog
the dog sniffs barriss ass in passing
barris steps out of the terminal
a black limo pulls up
the back door opens and barris gets in
seated in the back are jim byrd and simon oliver
oliver is pure ivy league with a pipe
when he speaks it is with an affected british accent
byrd is pissy
this is simon oliver
everything go okay
you dont look too good
barris do not ever again jeopardize one of my missions by killing a game show contestant
is that understood
youre welcome pal
do i make myself clear
theyre my contestants
tell me mr
barris are you in possession of my microfilm
yeah i got it
lets have it then
its up my ass oliver
why dont you reach on up there and get it
oliver tamps his pipe
byrd stares down at his thumbs
i just feel i deserve some appreciation for my efforts
what do you think patricia watson was
barris looks at byrd
byrd almost imperceptibly shakes his head no
barris now in t shirt and jeans shuffles through the busy bullpen area
employees wave say hi give barris the peace sign
he returns the gestures but halfheartedly
he seems depressed
loretta sidles up beside him
well if isnt the hitman
turning wild eyed what
i said well if it isnt the hitman
just heard through the grapevine that abc is going to pick up the newlywed game
youre kidding me
not kidding you
day time and prime time
oh fuck loretta
barris kisses loretta
barris joins them chanting hitman and dances around the office
the newlywed game was based on my theory that almost any american would sell out their spouse for a washer drier or a lawnmower you can ride on
such was my respect for that most holy of unions
i mustve been on to something because the show aired for thirteen years
barris speeds through the curvy streets of the hollywood hills
penny pacino dressed as a hippy sits in the front passenger seat
great wheels man
yeah i decided to start treating myself right
you spend so much time denying yourself things
lifes too short
yeah i really gork what youre saying man
you really grok what im saying man
the car screeches to a halt in front of a fancy house with a for sale open house sign out front
the house is empty
barris and penny are greeted at the door by a real estate agent
looking around outa sight
buy this one
if you wouldnt mind signing in on our sheet over th ill take it
ill take the house
penny happily kisses barris
beat very good sir
barris and penny are having sex on the floor
so man are you seeing anyone
i think we should get married
aw pen dont start no listen it makes sense
you and i feel exactly the same about marriage right
how much bullshit it is right
and the odds of us finding someone else with the exact same view on it are small
so it makes sense
barris types away
he is sweaty and naked except for a towel draped over his head
i liked penny
i even loved her in my way
but the idea of tying myself down for the rest of my life
i remember my parents marriage
barris five sits at the dinner table with his parents
his father dressed in a dental smock stares down at his plate as he eats
his mother absently chews and stares vacantly into space
we need a new ice box
the father shrugs
the set which holds four couples divides in the middle to reveal a new refrigerator
a brand new amana refrigerator freezer with automatic ice maker
one of the couples is cheering and screaming hysterically happy and in love and kissing
the other couples look disappointed and angry at their spouses
we pull back to reveal were watching this on a tv in
the office is filled to capacity with with hippy like employees watching the newlywed game
many sit on the floor jammed up against each other
a few women are nursing infants
someone passes a joint
barris sits behind his desk with a make love not war helmet on his head his feet up and a guitar in his lap
did you see that
how much they loved each other just then
thats what its all about kiddies
someone switches off the tv
okay guys new business

our supply of dumbfucks is lagging behind our demand for dumbfucks
and im gonna be introducing three new shows in the coming months the parent game the game game and the dollar ninety eight beauty pageant so were gonna really need

rick heads up to barriss desk
a few employees have joined barris at his desk with instruments
they break into a raucous banjo version of out of limits
everyones laughing and clapping
as out of limits continues now the actual version we see montage of barris shooting stabbing and garroting various foreign looking people in strange murky locations intercut with barris having
sex with patricia watson in different bedrooms and motel rooms barris dancing with patricia in various exotic locales and barris on the set for his many game shows happily directing the bustling activity
the actual jim lange host of the dating game
sometimes chuck would just disappear for weeks
i remember once we had a conflict on the set over the right way to throw that kiss at the end of the show yknow
demonstrates kiss and chuck was just not reachable to resolve it
what was the conflict
look its water under the bridge
im not gonna talk about it
the previously bare room is now filled with lovely and expensive furnishings
but barris and penny are again on the floor now playing scrabble by candlelight
penny lays down some tiles i n t e r p e t the words interpret
well do you have an extra r then i could borrow
im not going to give you a letter
youre lucky i dont make you forfeit a turn
penny retrieves her letters and studies the board
barris empties the wine into pennys glass
there wasnt much left
ill run to the store and get some more
barris pulls up in a jaguar xke convertible
a pretty innocent looking young woman monica is emerging with a big laundry bag from the laundromat next to the liquor store
she glances momentarily at the jaguar and at barris
barris enters with a bottle of wine
penny is in the same position on the floor
intrepets a word right
shit fuck piss
concentrating okay okay okay
pen we should call it a night
im kinda tired
i got a date

penny picks up her bag and exits in a huff
its a young womans apartment small and girly
the doorbell rings
monica clearly not out of her teens enters the room and answers the door
barris stands there with the bottle of wine
wow this is a beautiful place you got
barris enters looks around
theres another teenage girl in pajamas in the kitchenette mixing tuna salad

barris sits on the couch
monica sits next to him
mindy is in the background futzing around in the kitchen area

barris monica and mindy sit on the couch watching a religious show on television
yeah i remember that religious girl sure
oh god she had the softest fleeciest clam i ever experienced
it took a little more work than usual but i got in there baby
smacks lips then stares off into space it was some clam
you get old yknow but the taste for soft clam it just doesnt go away
this is the great tragedy of getting old
the room is abuzz with activity
lots of people on the phone talking
a potential newlywed game couple being interviewed
monica sits in the waiting area eavesdrops on the interview with the newlywed couple
getting married to alan is the best thing ive ever done
its just so wonderful knowing that youve got someone by your side through everything for he rest of your life
the couple kisses
monica enters the office
barris wears a deerstalker cap
my sweet little clamato
monica leans down and kisses barris
barriss eye twitches
crying i cant be pregnant chuck
is it mine
monica looks at him incredulously flings an ashtray at him misses
she sits at the desk looks glumly out the window
i cant believe you asked me that

he touches monicas hand
barris and monica sit in first class
barris stares out the window
monica stares straight ahead
beautiful country isnt it
barris leads a crying monica down the garbage strewn alley
they find a doorway
barris opens it
here we are
collapsing i cant i cant i cant i cant
barris supports her and leads her into the office
itll be okay
barris and penny walk sadly through the garden
what a waste
tell me about it
i figure over the years i mustve spent close to twenty grand on these abortions airfare hotels doctors gifts
thats not what i meant
and i dont even know how many of these fetuses were mine
thats what really kills me

it wasnt his
yes it was his baby
the godamn son of a bitch
he asked you to ask me this
i was screwing a lot of guys at the time
it coulda been his
i just needed someone to pay for it
he was a wallet with legs
yeah i was just a kid
it ruined my life
i dont really want to talk about this
we hold on a silent barris
barris and penny walk in silence
so im assuming this means monica is out of the picture
yeah i got baptized for nothing
chuck i was thinking
i have this plan now now that youre free god you look cute today
i always look cute

enthusiastically charged chuck why dont we get married
weve known each other forever

and youre almost forty chuck
barris turns violently toward penny
shouting i know how old i almost am
dont ever ask me to marry you again
quietly i wont
barris and penny are having sex
it is gentle and quiet
penny is crying trying to conceal it
im sorry i yelled at you today pen
im not crying because you yelled at me
this is it isnt it
this is us
barris studies pennys face in the dim light
the actual barris puffs on his cigar
i almost asked penny to marry me right then
but i didnt
barris sits naked on the bed swigging from a bottle of vodka as a prostitute in a black dress and veil sings happy birthday to him
when shes done she lifts the veil looks confused
is that right
barris sits staring out the window
his mood is somber
on the table beside him are many birthday cards
the anarchic and youthful decor of the office seems to mock barris now
not turning uh
rod flexners here
shit piss fuck send him in
hes a suit
great to see you
whats up rod
well the thing is chuck some of your shows arent doing too well in the old ratings war
the family game for one
we move into barriss eyes
the show is in progress
suddenly shots are fired from offstage
the host and contestants are slaughtered
its bloody and violent
were on barriss eyes
and hows your mother in law is quite frankly in the toilet chuck
a mother in law is being garotted with piano wire
her neck is sliced
now as you know dream girl is flailing terribly
dream girls lie bloody and flailing all over the set
and the game game has no life in it at all
the contestants on the set are all bloody and dead
an applause light flashes on and off but the audience members are also dead
so ive been put in the unfortunate position of having to inform you that the network is canceling all four of these shows
now dont shoot me chuck im just the messenger
barris drinks alone
hes sullen and sauced
to bartender they killed my babies
just like that
i pushed them into the world through the birth canal of my imagination
wheres the humanity of these people
the fucking bastards
what am i gonna do now
sees pretty woman hey there can i buy you a drink
what are you blind asshole
this ladys with me
screaming fuck you
the large man stands to face barris
he is very large
the man swings at barris
barris easily deflects the punch grabs the mans forearm and breaks it with a sickening crack
the man screams
barris gets him in a chokehold from behind
the man whimpers and gags
lets see if i remember correctly the next move breaks your neck which kills you instantly or paralyzes you
depending on your luck
lets go get out of here you pussy faggot piece of shit dog shit shithead
the large man hurries from the bar
everyone in the bar including the large mans date watches barris
to the woman hi
im chuck barris tv producer
have you ever done any acting
barris and the woman from the bar are having sex on the couch
hey i was just in the penny sees barris and the woman

this is not our house its my house
its our house
i found it with you
i decorated it for you
i spent six months sitting on that fucking couch shes fucking you on fucking waiting for the fucking plumbers to come
god you are such an asshole
penny throws the house key at barris
it hits him in the forehead
then she turns and storms from the house
barris looks over at the woman
she looks confused
i should go
this doesnt feel right
the woman stands grabs her purse pulls out an x glossy of herself and hands it to barris then exits
barris stares at the photo for a moment then opens a drawer and puts on top of a pile of similar photos
barris pulls up gets out of his car and heads toward the building
barris walks down the hall carrying a bouquet of flowers
he arrives at pennys door
there is an envelope attached to it with barriss name on it
he opens the envelope and reads the letter
dear chuck im dead now
i hope youre happy
the doors open
love always penny barris hurriedly opens the door enters the apartment looks around finds penny face down on the floor surrounded by empty champagne bottles and vials of pills
he stares at her body for a moment feeling faint
he drops to his knees
face down wanna see a stupid girl vomit
barris and penny sit in a booth
penny has black coffee in front of her
she is pale and drawn
why were you with that girl in our living room
its not our living room pen
thats your defense
you know what it feels like to see you with someone else
in any living room

no im not saying that
well then what are you saying chuck

of course i like you
i need to know how much you like me
beat i dont even know what that means how much
how can i rate a person in that way
you could if you felt it

you could spread your arms as wide as they would go and say this much penny
everythings complicated pen
nothings black and white like that
do you want me around or not
if you dont just say so so i know
barris and penny look at each other
she starts to cry
i love you pen in my way
maybe not in that crazy head over heels thing but what is that anyway
isnt that just an illusion
beat but you just said you love me right
a non descript american car is parked on the quiet wooded street
barris pulls up in his jaguar
he gets out of the car looks in the window of the empty american car
over here strawberry dick
barris looks over and makes out byrd sitting on a rock with a view of l
spread out in front of him
barris joins him
jesus how do you know these things
we even know what she actually thought it tasted like
i could never find that out
what did she think
its a need to know my friend
so tell me what can i do you for
i could really use an assignment jim
to straighten my head
i got something for your head
a dating game couple waits anxiously for host jim lange to announce their destination
and were the sending the two of you for three days and three nights to beautiful
the couple screams excitedly by reflect but as the destination sinks in their perplexity becomes apparent
barris and the dating game couple walk along
its cold and gray and they all wear heavy coats
the couple wear cameras around their necks
nobody looks happy
barris sits in the corner of this noisy smoky place
he has a stein of beer and reads a paper as a group of drunken germans in the background sing a song
patricia watson approaches and sits
barris looks up and smiles
kisses him sits so heres what we got
names hans colbert
pulls out photos other side of the wall
we dont like him very much
singing toot toot tootsie bye bye colbert bye bye
youll work with a kraut named keeler
hes been trailing colbert for a month now
knows the routine
keelers a drunk so you stay sober and take charge
collecting photos done and done
see you after
prove how much you love me baby
kill for me
then im all yours
barris crawls through a long dirt tunnel
telephone cables run along the floor
an occasional bare bulb lights the way
a middle aged man stands in his underwear at a mirror and shaves
the stall shower pushes away from the wall revealing a hole
barris steps through it covered in dust
he nods at the shaving man
he nods back hands barris a gun and a change of clothes and continues shaving
barris exits the apartment building in the clean clothes
we see the east berlin side of the wall in the background
a car pulls up and barris gets in
barris sits in the parked car with keeler a heavyset silent german man with nicotine stained fingers and teeth
he is constantly smoking and writing in a tiny notebook
there is a long silence
what you writing sig
i am keeping track of all the goings on on this street
barris looks out the window
there is nothing going on yet keeler keeps writing
hey keeler a bird just flew by
i know how to do my job
barris and keeler are still in the car
keeler continues to smoke and write
a well rested happy looking colbert walks by with a group of people
barris looks even more sickly
colbert rides by happily on a tandem bike with a lovely woman on the back
keeler continues to smoke and write
barris and keeler wait in the car
colbert emerges from his house alone and walks toward the car
a drained barris sighs a sigh of relief then suddenly and with unexpected force keeler swings open the passenger door
the door hits a stunned colbert and sends him flying
keeler races around the car grabs colbert throws him into the back seat and jumps on top of him
barris watches surprised at the dramatic personality shift in keeler
keeler is strangling colbert
a cigarettes is dangling casually from his lips as he does this
keeler turns colbert over so hes facing him so he can watch him die
calmly to barris under the seat please
barris reaches under the seat pulls out a polaroid camera
please if you dont mind a photograph
barris is stunned scared
he takes the photo
the flash illuminates the bulging eyed colbert and the calm keeler
a knock at the door
he looks up panicked
falsetto who is it
barris looks around
the place is a disaster
food wrappers crumpled papers liquor bottles strewn clothing plastic army men set up for battle
he gets up puts on a hotel bathrobe and his hat grabs his gun checks the peephole for a long moment and answers the door
the housekeeper is plump and kind looking
good morning mrs
looking around another rough night huh
tapping his head the human psyche is a wondrous thing
smiling maternally yes i know it is
taking gun we dont need this now do we
why dont we just put this away
she puts the gun in a drawer starts to pick up
barris watches her then mrs
reynolds may i rest my head on your bosom for a little while
oh that doesnt really seem like a very good idea mr
im just without
comfort of any sort and i
please forgive me
smiles at him no harm done
barris smacks himself in the head
bowing thank you
you are a scholar and
its fine sir
reynolds what do you suppose god thinks of someone like me
barris your television shows have brought laughter and joy to millions of people
thats a very important thing i think in these difficult times
i would imagine god likes you very much
barris smiles a rubber band smile
thank you thats very kind
glances at her ample bosom so
i should get back to
yes of course sir
dont mind me
barris resumes typing
the housekeeper cleans
a hollow eyed barris approaches the building that conceals the tunnel entrance
suddenly theres a commotion on the quiet street
the shaving man is being led handcuffed out of the building by two trench coated men
they shove him into a car
barris continues to walk by betraying no interest
he glances casually into the entranceway of the apartment building
another trenchcoated man waits inside the shadows
the car drives away
barris stops at the end of the block stares at the imposing wall
im really really fucked
another car pulls up next to him
picard a serious looking frenchman sticks his head out the window
who the hell are you
get in or die
barris hesitates gets in
the car screeches off
picard drives fast
barris eyes him suspiciously fingers his gun
picard spots a fiat in his rearview mirror
they know who you are monsieur barris
it is their intention to kill you very much in east berlin
barris checks in the passenger side mirror
not to worry my friend
picard speeds up dramatically but continues to drive calmly
barris is agitated
i am paul picard by the way
nice to meet you
do not worry i am not kgb
i do not want to kill you i want you to live a long happy life and have many dancing grandchildren to admire
picard screeches around a corner then another one
hes lost the fiat for the moment
picards car stops at the curb
picard and barris emerge
picard opens the trunk
he lifts out a big folded up clump of rubber with a an engine mounted on it
what the hell is that
your ride monsieur barris
picard unfolds the rubber mass
he pulls a cord and it begins to inflate
it is an airplane a one person inflatable plane
no fucking way
its quite reliable and easy to operate
it will get you over the wall
or you can stay here
in the german democratic republic
i will arrange for you to get a good factory job
no you must fly like daedalus before you to the freedom of the west
what about you
they do not catch me monsieur
this is my talent to get away always
this is my talent and perhaps this is my curse
the fully inflated rubber plane flies down the street dipping and rising erratically
the noise is deafening
barris lies on his stomach and steers looking petrified
he approaches the wall and manages to get the plane over it
the plane is shot by a soldier
air hisses out
barris sits on a park bench
jim byrd approaches sits
chuckling so did you have a nice flight
fuck you jim
it was terrifying
seems the kgb knew exactly what you were up to
you were there to kill colbert they were there to kill you
im thinking we got a mole
so much hate in the world chuck
am i in danger still
kgb didnt go out of business since yesterday so far as i know
youre fucked chuck
but our main concern should be if they know who you are they know who i am
what do we do
thats what im gonna do
youre lucky you have another career to immerse yourself in
barris sits with a several network executive and some other staff members watching a fat man tap dance badly and because of his weight extremely loudly
its painful for everybody to watch
the fat man finishes
that was great
the fat smiles and exits
barris puts his head in his hands
i dont know chuck
its looking bleak
theres gotta be somebody in america with some talent
ted mack got bookings every week
the executives look at each other
bring in the next thing
an assistant opens the door and a middle aged woman in pale blue polyester pants and joan crawford painted on eyebrows enters with a guitar
she begins to sing a folk song very sincerely in a very off key monotone
its unbearable and depressing
barris glances over at the executive shes checking her watch again
the song is endless
barriss eyes grow cloudy
this is the same field where renda was shot
now the folksinging woman is in the field singing
barris pulls out a gun and aims it at the woman
her eyes widen in terror but she keeps singing
a church bell chimes and barris shoots her
she flies back spurting blood
her guitar hits the ground with a twang
barris snaps out of his fantasy with renewed energy the folksinger is still droning on
ushering out thank you
well be in touch
that was wonderful
barris closes the door behind the folksinger and turns to the executives
weve been going about this all wrong
rather than killing ourselves trying to find good acts we just book bad ones and kill them
chuck its torture to sit through even one of these people we kill em before theyre through
as soon as it gets unbearable we kill em
for gods sake what are you talking about
celebrity judges ring a bell to end the act
to kill em
and when you kill something it stops
this i know to be true
barris and some suits watch from the booth as an octogenarian woman on stage sings born free in an impossibly high voice
jamie farr gongs the woman
the woman is angry
a vacuous host with great hair appears next to the woman
he seems genuinely agitated
whyd you do that jamie
this is someones grandmother
she was really trying
this is the gong show not the van cliburn eliminations
this is a human being with aspirations
muttering oh fuck me
this guy sucks
hes bringing everyone down
the executives eye each other
none of the hosts are getting it chuck
but we have a thought
all the executives smile at barris
you get it
and we believe your awkward non professional mumbling persona is exactly right for the show
i dont want to be on tv
listen we cant sit through anymore of these test shows
do it chuck or we advise the network to pull it
barris switches on the lights walks through the empty bullpen area to his office unlocks the door enters
barris enters stares out the window looks at himself in a full length mirror
stiff ladies and gentlemen welcome to the gong show
im your host chuck barris
turns away in disgust ucchhh
barris sits behind his desk draws a line down a piece of paper and writes pros and cons at the top of the page
under pros he writes become national celebrity get more attention from stewardesses even more women will want to have sex with me
under cons he writes easier target for kgb
he gets up paces
suddenly a shot rings out
it comes through the window and shatters the mirror
barris dives to the floor
more shots crazy relentless shooting
barris crawls on his belly to the window carefully reaches up and lowers the venetian blinds just as another shot whizzes through
the blinds explode
the shooting stops he waits on the floor shaking like a leaf
he pulls the list off his desk and writes under pro i need another hit before i die
center stage is empty
the band begins to play
the studio audience cheers
and now heres the host and star of our show chuck barris
the curtain rises
barris appears in a tuxedo coat denim work shirt cowboy boots and a hat pulled down over his eyes
welcome to the gong show
heres an esoteric act if there ever was one
its an ephemeral act
one that should get us our emmy
do we have an emmy
well this should get us one
anyway ladies and gentlemen
big nose leaps onto stage
he is skinny wearing a flowered shirt and a sarong and playing a toy flute while dancing in ladies platform shoes
suddenly he drops his flute rips off his sarong revealing polka dotted boxer shorts and a yellow leotard
he rushes to a steamer trunk opens it and begins crazily pulling out endless amounts of old newspapers
barris watches from the wings mesmerized
big nose is gonged
barris dances out onto stage to join him
i dont know
i dont understand
barris glances out into the audience
is it a gun
he starts to sweat
morgan is saying something about big nose
but we cant understand it
the audience laughs
barris continues to scan the audience
someone in headphones signals barris from behind a camera
to big nose well win a few lose a few
to audience well be back with more stuff
right after this message
barris waits on his mark for the taping to again begin
he watches the commotion around him with eagle eyes technicians and stagehands running around the audience chanting chuckie baby the celebrity panel joking with each other the guys in the
booth smoking the guys in the band laughing
barris turns around and around on his mark trying to catch every movement looking for a gun a suspicious character
the chanting continues louder and more distorted
the faces in the audience turn grotesque
barris sweats profusely his breathing becomes more and more shallow
suddenly his eyes roll back in his head and he drops to the stage floor unconscious
we see barris in bed hooked up to machines the executive woman sits by his bed showing him the headlines
you cant quit
i cant quit
but i get panicky louise in front of all those people
you lack confidence thats all
i lack confidence
but well take care of that
well get you some confidence powder
leave that to us
nose candy chuck
blow snow flake
does that work
barris on stage introducing an act
he is very confident
ladies and gentlemen oh this act is amazing your gonna love this act
im telling ya
all the way from pacoima
the curtain rises
a young man with a square of plexiglass in his hands presses his lips against the plexiglass and blows
it makes a farting noise and allows to the audience to see inside his mouth
barris snorts some cocaine
we hear the act and audience booing and yelling gong him
in the background
the actual jaye p
morgan is being interviewed
chuck was real different on stage and off
he was always looking over his shoulder
even when we were fucking
sort of an enigma
barris dances onstage with gene gene the dancing machine
the actual gene gene is being interviewed
oh yeah a real jekyll and hyde
sometimes nice as you please
give you the shirt off his back
other times hed rant like a crazy man
i remember once he screamed at me that i didnt know anything about dancing
nijinsky he yelled now there was a dancer
a black guy with weird teeth and a speech impediment attempts stand up
he looks petrified
today i had a bad day today
the audience yells how bad was it
this throws the performer
finally he continues
it was so bad my wife didnt even know how to cook
that barracuda took an egg put it in a pot of water and burned the water
we had to rush that to the hospital
the audience boos
my mother in law
the booing continues
the comedian cant take it
he looks disoriented
he turns away from the audience and puts his head in his hands
jamie farr gongs him
the actual jamie farr sits next to the pool
in the background we see a couple of kids with enormous noses splashing around in the water
chuck used to love to discuss philosophy
i think he was very saddened that the public saw him as this sort of spastic moron
i remember at the time i was reading wittgenstein
and chuck was just thrilled to have someone else in addition to rex reed to talk about that stuff with
barris lies in bed next to patricia
hes chatting on the phone lazily twirling the cord
look jamie you know as well as i that language does not exist without an outward criteria
wittgenstein said as much in investigations
but if you read ryle carefully looking at clock chuck
can we pick up tomorrow
but consider my thinking on elementary propositions
right back at ya amigo
barris hangs up
patricia kisses him
she pulls away
im concerned about you
i think you need to get back into the life
our sex was always amazing after you killed
truth is youre not that great after your discussions with jamie farr
the phone rings
picks up jamie i cant talk anymore tonight telephone voice this is siegfried keeler
i need to see you
barris jerks up surprised alarmed
patricia watches him
assassins do not fraternize
that keeler was calling me could mean it was my turn to get hit
phone voice i am in town on business chuck
and i desire nothing more than your company for dinner
i consider you one of my closest friends
dinner sounds good
theres a place called la scala
see you there at eight
barris hangs up
eyes closed dinner sounds good with whom
patricia glances over at barris
they stare at each other
barris pulls into the parking lot
as he waits for the valet parking attendant to get to him he adjusts the gun strapped to his ankle
barris enters the crowded restaurant looks around spots keeler sitting at a table in the rear
as he makes his way back barris shakes hands and says hello to several early seventies tv celebrities scattered throughout the restaurant carrol oconnor joanne worley flip wilson ron palillo
barris arrives at keelers table
keeler rises and embraces chuck
hes already drunk
a very fancy place
only the best for my friend
the friendships one develops during wartime are remarkably strong
there is an awkward silence
so how is the business of television
barris pleased to have something to talk about rambles
well its hit and miss
ive got a new show called operation entertainment which i believe is going to kill
its sort of a bob hope visiting the troops thing but its weekly and
keeler is staring right through barris
why do you do what you do chuck
well i like to think that i bring joy and laughter to millions of people
im not saying that my shows are as good as they could be
but why do you kill
barris looks around clears his throat
during the second world war i had the pleasure of killing
i found it exhilirating
afterwards i could find nothing else to fill me so much with life
so i became what i am today
i wanted the exhiliration again
the waiter appears
are you gentlemen ready to order
ill have the shrimp scampi and a green salad
and for you sir
um just give me a steak
the waiter leaves
keeler sips his drink stares at barris
whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy whole might
work while it is called for the night cometh wherein no man can work
its amazing you should quote him
hes my hero
i read in a book recently that killing your first man is like making love to your first woman
every smell every nuance you remember with a special allure as if the acts had occured outside civilization outside time
and when the allure is gone you are condemned
i am condemned to live the rest of my life outside civilization
you will be too my good friend
barris looks into keelers hollow eyes
the actual barris puffs on his cigar
the next day i heard keeler offed himself
keeler falls silently in slow motion from a very high window
you never really know in the world of espionage if something labeled a suicide actually is a suicide
but he was dead
that i knew
barris eats dinner with penny
barris seems depressed
penny is reserved
when you called i wasnt gonna come
im glad you did pen
i said to myself enough
enough of this jerk already
i could see how you would feel that way
but ive come upon something interesting through my delvings into human psychology
its called ta transactual analysis
now see by correcting me youre responding as parent to my child
authoritative voice heres the proper way to say this word penny
but thats okay
as long as we both understand thats what youre doing
yknow im okay youre okay
so whats wrong chuck
are you okay
a guy i knew killed himself last night
everyone you know kills themselves
who is it this time
you dont know him
whyd he do it
he didnt like his work anymore
is being a stagehand really bad or something
beat yeah its pretty bad
patricia storms up to the table
you were supposed to meet me at the palm two hours ago
oh fuck i forgot
who is this
i do not get stood up
do you understand
um penny this is patricia
to patricia how did you find me
are you serious
thats what i do for a living
what does she mean thats what she does for a living
youre dead in my book strawberry dick
there is no second chance
to penny nice meeting you penny
ive heard a lot about you
to barris walking away oh by the by byrds dead
penny just looks down at the table
im only gonna give you one more chance man
barris snorts some coke pulls out of the studio parking lot
the sound of his heart beating pounds in his ears
another car pulls behind him
a wired barris notices the car in his rearview mirror
the other car turns also
barris speeds up
so does the other car
barris panics he tries to lose the other car
a chase ensues
finally barris screeches to a halt pulls a gun from his glove compartment
the second car screeches to a halt behind him
barris already out of his car and at the drivers side window of the second car
he looks in and sees there are two petrified teenagers a boy and a girl holding up their hands
barris pulls open the door
screaming who sent you
who the fuck sent you
we just waited for you to leave after the show
we just think the show is cool
we just think youre cool
the girl is crying
please dont kill us
barris points the gun at them for a long while his hands shaking wildly
barris stands backstage waiting for his cue
the unknown comic appears next to him wearing a paper bag with two eyeholes cut out over his head
barris glances over at him
barris doesnt say anything
he studies the bag
barris pulls a pistol from an ankle holster and jams it against the bag
take it off
the fucking bag
take it off
the unknown comic takes the bag off
he looks terrified
barris stares him down
ladies and gentlemen chuck barris
barris dances onto the stage
barris is clapping his hands together
he looks happy and relaxed
the audience is cheering
here he is the prince of puns the wizard of whoopee
the unknown comic
the unknown comic appears upstage with bag on head
chuckie baby chuckie baby chuckie baby
what do you want
whats the difference between toilet paper and a shower curtain
i dont know
calling off heres the guy
the audience laughs
barris feigns annoyance and pushes the unknown comic off the stage
get out of here
for barriss ears only youre fucking crazy man
barris sits behind his desk drinking and popping pills
loretta pokes her head in
phone call from someone named tuvia
ill take it
dont hang up
barris picks up the phone
hello is this chuck barris
oh this is tuvia feldman
i dont know if you remember me of course i do
im in town and ive been following your career and i wondered if you might want to get a drink
for old times sake
tuvia plays with the dog
white panties are revealed
adult tuvia answers the door with her baby
barris waits in a booth anxiously eyeing the door
a guy approaches
hey chuck i got a talent
just take a second
the guy gets down on all fours and starts barking and panting like a dog
it is a repulsive and frightening sight but barris becomes transfixed by it and cannot take his eyes off the guy
barris tears his eyes away from the dog guy to look at tuvia
she is an older middle aged lady
younger than chuck but clearly of no interest to him
the disappointment on his face is palpable
you look great
barris sits in a booth across from tuvia
the relationship has shifted once again
now middle aged tuvia is trying to flirt
as they talk she touches his arm repeatedly
she laughs at everything he says
she reapplies lipstick as they talk
theres a quiet desperation in her eyes
barris is pleasant but unengaged
the fantasy of tuvia forever cast out by the reality of tuvia
finally because of my fame and her desperate straits her poverty and single parenthood she was going to submit to me
finally i couldve had her
i couldve had what had so long eluded me
but now she was old and i wasnt interested
middle aged tuvia staring out at the night time landscape in the darkened train car her suitcase on the seat next to her
barris is having sex with two twenty year old nymphettes the drugs and alcohol flow freely
he seems to be enjoying himself but there is a hollowness in his eyes
tuvia was old but not me
i was the game show king
the rabid audience members chant chuckie baby chuckie baby chuckie baby
barris snorts coke in the darkness
he scans an article headlined chuck barris is the decline of western civilization
the phone rings alarmingly breaking the stillness
paul picard is dead
barris looks down from the plane as picard on the ground runs after it
yelling fly daedalus fly
barris hangs up the phone
he stares off into the distance
the phone rings again again shattering the silence
barris on stage with red stocking hat
this is the moment weve been waiting for
the contestants appear on stage
the winner is miss tiny brooks
a model appears with a trophy and a big check and hands it to an enormously fat woman
the other contestants appluad
two midgets dance
the band plays
a massive amount of confetti and balloons fall on everyone
its the emmy awards
barris is in the audience next to his starlet date
he sweats through his tuxedo fidgets
ed asner and caroll oconnor are on stage presenting
and the winner is taxi
the taxi theme starts as the winners make their way to the stage
brooks stan daniels and ed
weinberger executive producers
the starlet whispers into barriss ear outraged at the unfairness
i dont see why your shows are never nominated
barris looks sick
jim brooks is on stage accepting
and i honor you members of the academy for recognizing and supporting high quality television
barris is locked in a stall vomiting
the door to the bathroom opens
barris peeks through the closed stall door
its jim brooks whistling and holding his emmy
he places it next to the sink unzips his fly and pisses
an agitated barris pulls his gun from his ankle holster opens the stall door a crack and shakily aims the gun at brooks back
but as i stood there i realized i couldnt kill jim brooks the man who was responsible for such good stuff mary tyler moore rhoda cindy phyllis episodes of my
i loved those shows as much as anybody in america
barris is crying
he turns the gun away from brooks almost against his will and sticks it in his own mouth
after a moment he realizes he cant do that either
i couldnt kill either of us so i let us both live
jim brooks and me
the rest is history
barris puts the gun away flushes the toilet and exits the stall
hey congratulations jim
brooks turns and looks at barris
the gong show
hey thanks chuck
once again you deserve it
your shows are the greatest
you bring so much
quality to the medium
i appreciate that
i really do they smile and nod at each other awkwardly
chuck waits for some sort of return of the compliment
it does not come
they continue to nod at each other
the actual jim brooks is being interviewed
i dont really remember ever meeting chuck barris
in the mens room at the emmys he says
brooks thinks looks at interviewer
im not saying it didnt happen
im just yknow
if he remembers it im sure it happened
really doesnt seem like much of an anecdote though
a big party is in progress
the place is packed
late seventies celebrities abound
alan alda is there
burt reynolds jamie farr jaye p
morgan gene gene the dancing machine pam dawber farrah fawcett majors and lee majors john belushi
chuck barris steps out of the bathroom drink in hand
he wipes his nose like someone whos just snorted coke
he wanders disconsolately and slightly wild eyed through the crowd
he sits in a chair
a man sitting across from him looks at barris
his eyes light up
hey youre chuck barris
i love your show
im just heading i have a talent i think youd really appreciate
party man begins farting jingle bells
barris gets up and moves away
calling after hey didnt you ever hear of le petomane
he was a star buddy
these are totally smell free
barris settles by the fireplace
a pretty woman approaches smiling
i thought it was you
bowing its me
im glad to meet you because i wanted to tell you that ive seen the gong show and i think you are the most insidious and despicable force in entertainment
well how dare you subject the rest of the world to your loathsome view of humanity
i dont think its that loathsome
what is it then
to mock some poor lonely people who just crave a little attention in their lives
to destroy them
so everybodys not brilliantly talented
theyre still people
they deserve respect and compassion
i mean who the hell are you
what the fuck have you ever done that elevates you above the pathetic masses
oh i forgot you created the dating game
wow right up there with the sistine chapel
i guess thats what gives you the right to
excuse me ive got to barris loses himself in the crowd
he hurries past a guy who recognizes and starts chanting
barris turns and makes his way through the crowd to the door
barris makes his way down the crowded street
people stare turn their heads to gawk
we hear over and over again hey isnt that chuck barris
and hey look the gong show guy
and chuckie baby chuckie baby
barris smiles wanly and nods
people shove paper and pen in his face and he scribbles autographs without stopping
sweat forms on his brow
his polyester shirt is drenched
she was right
what the hell had i done with my life
among the fans on the street barris spots the fat bachelor he killed in london
he sports a bullet hole in his head barris does a double take
wait youre that guy
this is screwy
i only want to be loved
thats all i fucking wanted
barris hurries away from the fat bachelor
he begins to spot others converging on him the corpses of those he killed bloody and disfigured
crazy angry looking gonged gong show contestants appear in the crowd with weapons
kgb agents in trench coats and sunglasses wield guns day of the dead skeletons dance after him
barris breaks into a run
suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the l
barris dashes across the street almost getting hit by a car
he ducks down an alley to catch his breath
as he leans against the wall and heaves a middle aged woman appears somewhat backlit by the street light
my name is louise wechsler and im here from tulsa with my family and
please im not feeling well
just a moment of your time
i love your show
and well i sort of have a talent myself
you can stop by the office to audition tomorrow
the woman continues to approach
well im leaving tomorrow and i was just wondering
see i dance a little and i was just wondering theres no way out of this
yeah all right
barris turns to face the woman whos very close now
she starts to dance around sort of ballet like very badly
she pirouettes arms above her head
something in her hand glints in the light
barris reflexively grabs her arm
its an ice pick
the two wrestle for it
the woman is extremely strong
barris jams the palm of his hand up into the womans nose
she staggers back but doesnt drop the ice pick
barris leaps at her
the two roll on the ground
the woman pins barris
she straddles him and is about to stab him through the air
barris reaches under her skirt and grabs her crotch
the middle aged woman is a man
he screams in a distinctly male voice
barris takes the moment of distraction to grab the ice pick and jam it up through the assailants chin and into his brain
the assailant slumps over
barris pushes the body off himself kneels beside it and pulls off the wig
he gets up shaking and heaving
he looks at the body one more time kicks it in the head with all his might
that was it
i just disappeared
the network had to put the gong show into reruns
i holed myself up in this hotel in new york
we see barris from above shivering and naked in the corner
the manuscript pages are piled high next to the typewriter
barris looks up at the camera with outstretched arms appealing to the gods
who am i
there is a pounding on the wall from a neighbor
shut the fuck up
theres a knock at the door
barris crawls toward it peeks through the peephole
barris unlocks the door
simon oliver stands there
howd you know where i was
chuck chuck chuck dont be an orangutan
we always know where you are
we always know what youre doing
by the by id think twice before id attempt to get that tripe youre writing published
and theres a typo on page
look what do you want oliver
i dont work for you anymore
i have things to
barris trails off
id like you to come back for one last assignment chuck
good bye i think you might be interested when i tell you its the mole who fingered your friends jim byrd and paul picard
and seigfried keeler
keeler committed suicide
yes of course he did
he threw himself from a twentieth floor window after he strangled himself to death with an electrical cord
beat im not interested oliver
as long as the moles alive you dont have a chance in hell of remaining so
besides killing is in your blood old man
you fit the profile
barris lunges at oliver pushes him against the wall
that fucking profile again
whats the fuck is it
what the fuck do you bastards know about me that i dont
where to begin
first let go of me
barris lets go
oliver sits in a chair straightens his shirt
well you had a twin sister stillborn strangled by your umbilical cord
your first hit chuck
your mother always wanted a daughter
she blamed you for your sisters death
and so until your sister phoebe was born she raised you as a girl
thats not true
oh and your father the dentist
not really your father
your biological father was a man named edmund james windsor
a serial killer
a fact your mother didnt know when she had an affair with him in
if you want to look him up he was also known as the tarrytown troll because he had been described by witnesses as short and ugly
windsor died in the electrical chair at ossining in
we believed your self loathing tendencies coupled with that extra y chromosome and whatever else you inherited from your father would serve us well
im trying to think what more i can tell you
im sure theres more
but you have me at a disadvantage here barris
i dont have your files in front of me
just leave me the hell alone
your mother always loved the game shows and you so wanted to please her
we never expected the game show business to work out for you
but that it did turned out to be in our favor
i guess your need to be a good daughter drove you more than we anticipated
barris lunges at oliver
the two wrestle on the floor
barris punches him repeatedly in the face
barris lies sleeping in a tangle of sheets
theres blood on his hands
a knock at the door
barris jumps awake grabs his gun
he looks around
the room is a mess stuff knocked over
theres been a fight
he sees his bloody hands
barris brings his gun with him to the door looks through the peephole then opens the door
penny stands there takes in the room the mess the haggard barris
jesus howd you find me
am i listed in some guidebook or something
you sent me your last letter on hotel stationary
well its great to see you pen
you look beautiful
barris hugs her
i dont really
but i appreciate the lie
i know how you hate lying
looking around boy this place is scary looking
taps his head the human psyche
i came to take you back to california with me
its a lonely state without you
i dont know redhead
i cant wait forever for you to ask me to marry you you know
well apparently i can
but i really dont want to
crying i love you so much
you dont understand
i dont even know why
youre such a schmuck
you dont know the half of it
youre not gonna marry me are you
i dont know if i can
penny nods her head and leaves
barris watches her go then falls to the floor and weeps
barris dressed in a suit sits with patricia watson
he smiles across the table at her
i cant believe you finally left your two hundred dollar a night cave to see me
yknow i got a visit this morning from penny
shes wanted to marry me forever
but she doesnt know who i am what ive what im capable of
and she cant ever know
so what does she really love
and i started thinking treesh you are the only woman in the world who truly knows me
i know ive screwed you over in the past and im really sorry
i just want you to know that youre the one i want to be with
i love you treesh
patricia looks at him
her hard as nails demeanor softens
barris smiles and reaches across the table for her hand
barris and patricia stand looking out at the harbor
i hate myself for how ive lived treesh
neitzsche said whoever despises oneself still respects oneself as one who despises
i never thought of that
jesus i cant even despise myself with any insight
insane asylums are filled with people who think theyre jesus or satan
very few have delusions of being the guy down the block who works at an insurance company
wonder what that means
yknow i wanted to be a writer once
i wanted to write something that someday some lesser person would quote
but i never did
im the lesser person treesh
i never said anything meaningful that wasnt said by somebody else first
i am disposable
i disposed of people and i am disposable
beat you look cold
barris drapes his jacket over patricias shoulders
chuck whats gotten into you
youre actually acting like a gentleman
barris kisses her
she lets him
well its late
i should get going
i suppose you still wont tell me where youre staying
but ill show you
she takes his hand
they walk off
patricia enters followed by barris
she turns on the light
patricia pours some drinks
there are a couple of chairs near the window
barris sits in one
ive been thinking a lot about you lately chuck
patricia approaches barris with the drinks hands him one
ive missed you
you couldve fooled me
well ive mellowed
patricia takes barris by the hand leads him to the window
bostons a beautiful city
we could start over here
a normal persons life
that sounds right
patricia flops down in the chair that barris had been sitting in
barris sits in the chair across from her
patricia raises her glass
patricia casually slides her hand under the chair cushion
in one swift move barris pulls a gun from his ankle and shoots patricia three times twice in the head once in the heart
the force of the bullets has tipped the chair over
patricia lies sprawled on the floor
barris stands and looks at patricias body
she holds a gun
simon oliver sits sipping an espresso
he has a black eye and bruised face
barris enters looking haggard
he sits and stares at oliver
its done and im done
but if you get antsy
and you will
oliver smiles and walks off
barris sits for a moment then stands walks over to a payphone and dials
