written by larry and andy wachowski based on the graphic novel by alan moore in the darkness we hear a voice a womans voice
her name is evey
remember remember the fifth of november the gunpowder treason and plot
i know of now reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot
her voice has a strength that is metered by a calmness a deep centered peace that we can feel
those were almost the very first words he spoke to me and in a way that is where this story began four hundred years ago in a cellar beneath the
houses of parliament
in the darkness we find a lantern
guy fawkes a dangerous man who wears a goatee is struggling with a wheelbarrow stacked with barrels of gunpowder
in guy fawkes attempted to blow up the houses of parliament
the wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the cellar floor
from the dark depths we hear the sound of dogs
he was caught in the cellars with enough gunpowder to level most of london
guy sees lanterns coming from both sides
he tries to run as the dogs reach him first
he grabs for his sword as dozens of pole axes pin him against the tunnels stone wall
sometimes i wonder where we would be if he hadnt failed
i wonder if it would have mattered
in the dim pre dawn light guy is led to the gallows
i suppose the answer is in the rhyme
more than the man what we must remember is the plot itself
the coarse noose of rope is snugged up to guys throat
he looks into the crowd until he finds a face a womans face staring up at him
for in the plot we find more than just a man we find the idea of that man the spirit of that man and that is what we must never
the lever is thrown and the woman looks down a tear falling down her face
this then is the story of that idea of that spirit that began with an anarchists plot four hundred years ago
guys body hangs in silhouette lifeless against a red morning sun
a young evey sits on her fathers lap combing her barbies hair
i was born near the end of the millennium the year
my father used to say that people were so afraid that the world was going to end that they were willing it to happen
her father sits beside her mother on the living room couch watching the news
from the look on their faces the news is bad
i dont remember much of the centurys turn
i dont remember the market crash or the plague or any of the trafalgar riots
the television flickers with images of heavily armed soldiers fighting in a shelled city
ive read about them since but i dont recall how any of them impacted my life except for the fear
they would hide it from me like a secret between them
little evey sees her father staring at her mother
they take hold of each others hand clasping them tight
but i could feel it
it is a new day
people are gathered along the street as if they were waiting for a parade
of the chaos that seemed to swallow the beginning of the st century there is one thing i do remember
evey holds her fathers hand
unable to see what is coming she can hear it
very clearly i can remember that sound
we hear them hundreds of marching soldiers
and i remember those boots black leather that gleamed bright in the morning sun
i had never seen such boots
all moving in perfect unison
little evey hides in the forest of adults clinging to her fathers leg staring as row after row of boots march by with military precision
in the midst of a political rally for the emerging new party calling itself norsefire we find little evey now on her fathers shoulders
dascombe a young man paces the podium inciting the crowd
the time has come london to return to a bygone age an age of tradition an age of values that have been disparaged and all but forgotten
what this country needs is a leader
a true leader to remind us of that age
a righteous leader with the strength of his moral convictions to do what must be done
i give you that man
i give you our leader
adam susan rises and the crowd cheers
eveys father looks at her mother and again they clasp hands
it must have seemed so easy to them
they offered such a simple deal give up control and we will restore order
little evey is asleep in her bedroom
at first the arrests were political
a loud crash of splintering wood wakes her up
when my parents were younger they had been activists
they had marched with labor in the great train strike
the sound of heavy boots swarms through the house
her bedroom door bursts open and a heavily armed soldier scoops her up
she is carried through the dark house which is filled with soldiers
on the floor of the living room she sees her parents being bound with plastic zip ties
dont take my daughter
a heavy black hood is pulled over each of her parents heads as evey is carried out of the house
i never saw them again
overnight my life my entire world was erased
a nun with a switch in her crossed arms watches as evey and several other little girls scrub the floor of a dormitory bathroom
it was done so quickly and violently so completely that it began to seem that it had never even existed
a tear rolls down little eveys cheek
a gay man is dragged violently from his piccadilly home
outside he sees his lover being forced to the cobblestones
the homosexuals were next
what god had started with aids had to be finished by man
it was gods work
thats what we were told
he reaches for him as the clubs rise and fall vicious and bloody
but once they were gone there was someone else
in another neighborhood we see the police arresting pakistanis
in a different area young black men are packed into a caged van so tightly they are unable to move
there were those who understood what was happening who knew it was wrong but who kept silent
a young detective named finch looks down as the van pulls away
when he looks up another man in a military uniform whose name is almond is watching him
and in the vacuum of that silence order was imposed
finch sticks his pipe in his mouth and turns away
again we see the marching boots
order that was like those boots order that required rigorous discipline
order that is exactly the same where each single step falls with every step
the order of the many shaped into one
we move through the columns of marching soldiers to a wall where a poster has been plastered up
the poster reads strength through purity purity through faith
somehow in my heart i knew it wouldnt last
as the sound of the marching fades a shadow falls over the sign
after a moment we hear the hiss of spray paint
what they thought they had crushed the spirit they believed trampled and ground beneath the marching of their boots rose up rose as if from a four hundred year old
grave rose to remind us all that day
the shadow sprays a v over the poster
close on a loudspeaker
there is one on every major street corner
good evening london
its nine oclock the fourth of november in the year and this is the voice of fate broadcasting on and of the medium wave
beneath the loudspeaker is a surveillance system labeled for your protection
bubble eyed lenses iris at the end of stalks that move insect like racheting and clicking as they watch a little girl pedal her bicycle
the little girl glances nervously over her shoulder up at the mechanical eyes watching her
people of london be advised there is a radio on a small makeup table
that braxton and streathon are quarantine zones as of today
evey is now a young woman
she slips into a dress that is little more than a nightgown
she tries to adjust it pulling it down at the hem pulling it up at the thin shoulder straps but it is like trying to hide behind a lamppost
it is suggested that these area be avoided for reasons of health and safety
another radio in a room that seems to be of another world
good news following the productivity reports from herefordshire indicating a possible end to meat rationing starting mid february
a man enters the room as he once entered the world
his body is lean and strong and though we do not see his face there is a strength in his carriage a power to his presence
she packs tissue paper into the toes of a pair of high heels that are too big for her
police raided seventeen homes in the birmingham area uncovering what is believed to be a major terrorist ring
we move over a dressing bureau past a wig and over a pair of black leather gloves moving until we find the mask it is like something from the masquerade
ball of another era
it has an exaggerated goatee harlequin cheeks and a smile forever fixed at once be guiling and be deviling
twenty eight people eight of them women are currently in detention awaiting trial
evey coats her lips with a lascivious red
she stares into the mirror her makeup like a mask over her own face
and that is the face of london tonight
the man now fully dressed in cloak hat and mask gazes into the mirror
this is v
and this is the voice of fate signing off and bidding you a pleasant evening
close on eveys high heels stumbling and awkward as she walks down a dark cobblestoned street
close on vs boots walking in the opposite direction so that it seems they are walking towards each other
i dont know what brought us together that night
i had never been to that part of westminster but ever since ive known him ive stopped believing in coincidence
evey looks up and sees a man standing mostly in shadow
excuse me mister
the man turns around
it is not v
would you like
uh would you like to sleep with me
i mean for money
that is the clumsiest bit of propositioning ive ever heard
oh god im sorry
is this your first time darling
yes no i mean for money
but i know what you want and ill do it
she presses her body to his using her little girl eyes and her womans mouth
anything you want mister
please i need the money
i know im young but i promise i know what im doing
you dont know what youre doing
he pulls out his wallet and shows her a badge
the sight of it knocks the breath out of her
christ youre a fingerman
give the little lady a prize
ive got something to give her
evey turns and there are more fingermen behind her
prostitution is a class h offense
know what that means
it means that we get to exercise our own judicial discretion and you get to swallow it
the fingermen laugh
oh god please
its my first time
please dont hurt me
gosh fellas look at those big innocent eyes
what do you think
spare the rod spoil the child
fingerman laughs hard as he drops his pants
he shoves her face first against a brick wall lifting her dress to expose her bottom
you heard the man sweetie
this rods for your own good
suddenly they are no longer alone
the multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him
what the hell and fortune on his damned quarrel smiling showed like a rebels whore
were police officers pal
were with the finger
so bugger off
disdaining fortune with his brandished steel which smoked with bloody execution
in the clenched fist of black leather we see a flash of steel
hes got a knife
v attacks and at once we know this is no normal human being
a single blow sends the largest of the fingermen flying backwards
but more than his strength it is his speed
a gun is cocked but before the hammer falls a knife is buried in the fingermans chest and before the body falls the knife is gone
it takes a handful of seconds and three bodies lay on the ground
v turns to the last fingerman who is struggling to pull his pants up
dont hurt me
v steps forward and he screams bolting while holding his pants up
who who are you
i imagine all manner of names shall be heaped upon my humble visage but for now let us simply say i am the villain
he throws wide his cloak and bows deeply to her
and you would be
they hear sirens rushing towards them
in a blink he scoops her up and dashes into the shadows of a narrow alleyway
police cars and several ambulances swarm over the area with the dead fingermen
v watches them from above
why did you do that
why did you
he takes out an old antique pocket watch
it is almost midnight
for the music
evey i am a performer
is that why youre wearing a mask
we all wear masks
life creates them and forces us to find the one that fits
do you know what day it is
not for long
he looks out where rising above the rooftops he can see big ben
remember remember the fifth of november the gunpowder treason and plot
i know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot
the second hand sweeps into the final minute
tell me evey what good is an actor that plays his part to an empty theatre
i dont know
nor do i
thats why you are here
i need you evey
i need someone to listen
to your music
yes to my music
from his sleeve he pulls a conductors wand
can you hear it
its already begun
he begins to lightly tap the wand in the air and very faintly we hear it
i cant hear anything
at first you have to listen very carefully
he continues to conduct and we begin to hear the music violins and horns that seem almost like a whisper or a wind that steadily swells
there it is
beautiful is it not
he turns to the parapet his gestures growing grander as the music rises and we recognize tchaikovskys overture
the music mounts a climax and v points the wand at big ben as cymbals crash big ben explodes with such force the world seems to shake while v smiling
always smiling points again with another crescendo and the statue of justice is blown to smithereens
v nods in appreciation while mustering the music towards its finale as fireworks begin lighting up the sky
everywhere across the city people stand transfixed by the dazzling shimmer of the fireworks until a strobing final blitz leaves a single starry image floating in the smoke filled sky
it is the letter v
from every direction the city screams with the panicked sound of sirens
a massive modern building that is the seat of the new government
a long black car pulls up to the entrance
adam susan gets out wearing a long black trenchcoat over his pajamas
he is the leader and he looks older heavier and meaner
he hurries past the heavily armed guards barely acknowledging the snap and cock of their nazi like salute
the leader enters his main chambers and we see the fate computer system
it is a cerebral cortex for a vast intelligence network
information can almost be felt coursing through its hard drives
the leader sits at once regaining a measure of composure
he takes a deep calming breath and accesses the system
dozens of monitors fill with images from all across the city most of them are of the damage caused by v
gentlemen i will hear your reports now
heyer speak for the eye
conrad heyer appears on one of the screens
he is at his desk inside the command center for the eye the governmental organization responsible for the visual surveillance systems
we have less than two minutes of usable footage leader
it took the suspect less than a minute to dispatch the fingers vice patrol
on an insert screen we see grainy footage of v rescuing evey from one of the pole mounted cameras
as you can see the suspects reflex speed is extraordinary
as is his strength
as the last body falls v seems to pause and looks back over his shoulder straight into the camera
the leader stares at the smiling face
im afraid the mask makes retinal identification impossible
etheridge report for the ear
bunny etheridge appears on another screen
behind him huge spooling reels of audiotape wind constantly
we were able to triangulate the origin of the fireworks
we also are currently monitoring a lot of phone surveillance indicating a high percentage of conversation concerned with the explosions
all suspect or significant transcripts are being forwarded to mr
finch speak for the nose
finch no longer the same young man stands at the site of the fireworks launch
thanks to etheridge we found the launch for the fireworks
these appear to be individually weighted flares and we have found traces of the same chemicals at both of the detonation sites which leads us to conclude that despite a
level of sophistication these devices are all home made with over the counter chemicals making them impossible to trace
whoever he is leader hes good
thank you for that professional annotation
an intercom opens
almond has arrived
gentlemen keep me informed of any further developments
they answer in unison as almond enters the office
his face is harder but he has the same violent gleam in his eye
the leader turns in his chair
almond do you know what this is behind me
the fate computer system sir
its more than that
this this computer is a symbol mr
a symbol of the highest attainable goal of mankind
do you know what that goal is mr
almond does not
the leader leaps from his chair while pounding the desk
the world around us is a changing directionless amoral morass and it is up to man and man alone to set things right
he moves around the desk at almond
without control man is nothing more than any other stinking sweating brute animal
the control that we have painstakingly built up over the last ten years
now do you understand what happened last night
last night someone did the unthinkable
someone hurt us
it is imperative that we act swiftly and precisely
i want that man found mr
i want his head or by god ill have yours
evey is wearing a blindfold and v leads her by her fingertips guiding her almost as if they were dancing
his fingers slip free of her and she reaches out
ive lost you
no you havent
he is behind her and he removes the blindfold revealing his house to her
it is a labyrinth of interconnecting underground tunnels and rooms
the gallery is the main room as it is filled with an amazing collection of human culture
there is art that spans from the renaissance to the painted covers of eerie comics literature that ranges from shakespeare to spillane philosophy from plato to bukowski and a vast
collection of nonfiction
there are movie posters everywhere and an entire wall is lined with videocassettes
a jukebox stands in front of an enormous vinyl and cd collection of music
where did you get it
i saved it
like everything here
she punches a button and billie holiday begins to sing
oh its beautiful
ive never heard anything like it
of course not
you grew up in their world
art is created by individuals and there are no individuals in a world where you are told what to think
this place is amazing
youre welcome to stay
she stops suddenly and looks at him
the offer is terribly exciting but it is so unlike anything she has ever done that its almost impossible to imagine
if you like
i dont even know your name
i dont have a name
but you can call me v
i like that
and she returns his smile
the only operating broadcast tower in london home of the mouth
lewis prothero leans forward and lets his voice pour like syrup over the microphone
good morning london
this is the voice of fate damn
he stops and coughs
good morning ack
good morning lond goddammit
where is my bloody tea
in the control booth roger dascombe his hair thinner now rubs his temple
would someone get his lordship his bloody tea
he clicks on the microphone
lewis they want this report on the first hour i know
damned inconvenient this entire affair
lets try again
he clears his voice and the red record light turns on
good morning london
it is am the fifth of november and this is the voice of fate
the new day brings good news and bright prospects from overseas where negotiations with new china are moving in a positive direction
last nights scheduled demolition of two deteriorating landmarks went off without a hitch
dascombe is unable to stop himself from smiling
spokesman for the interior ministry said both structures were severely damaged and judged to be a danger to the unsuspecting public
plans for new landmarks are well underway
prothero sits back shaking his head
do you believe this crap dascombe
its not our job to believe it lewis
our job is to tell the people exactly what they tell us
i know but do you think that people will believe it
they will if its you thats telling it to them
now lets try it again
v is alone listening to the first morning broadcast
plans for new landmarks are already well underway
he clicks off the radio
walking down a hall he stops and peers into eveys new bedroom
she is fast asleep looking remarkably at peace
quietly he shuts the door
people are hurrying to board a departing train
prothero is staring out his window
remember remember the fifth of november
he talks to his bodyguards almost as if talking to himself
do you suppose thats why he did it
sir who did what sir
he tried to blow up parliament
the guards look at each other confused
dont they teach history in school anymore
sir were both straight military sir
sir yes sir
i was fighting in ireland by the time i was sixteen
yes of course
he turns back to his window
the train rumbles along heading for a tunnel
prothero watches the countryside rolling past
i love trains
i remember riding the underground with my father
shame they shut them all down
bodyguard looks out the opposite window just as the train enters the tunnel
what the hells that
for a flashing instant we see v in silhouette cloak swirling around him like dark wings as he jumps from the bridge onto the train
prothero and bodyguard stare at bodyguard
i thought i saw a man jumping onto the train
the trains doing almost seventy
it would break his legs
youre right i
it must have been rags
deep in the tunnel a dark figure glides across the rooftops
the conductor hears something on the roof
he peers up just as v swings down smashing feet first into the cab
the brakes suddenly lock throwing bodyguard into prothero
get off of me
a moment later the lights are cut off and the entire train is plunged into complete darkness
what the fuck is going on
lock the car doors
i have a lighter
i cant find the lock wait
hey wha there is a muffled shriek followed by a sharp snap
whats happening there is another sound like the leather slap of a boxer pounding a heavy bag followed by the sound of the heavy bag collapsing onto the floor
i found it
he flicks on the lighter and in the dim light of its flame he sees the smiling face
v sits casually arms folded across from prothero
the bodyguards lay dead on the floor
who are you
what do you want
is that it
v just smiles
youre youre the one that blew the bailey
v nods and protheros eyes go wide
youre making a mistake
im nobody on the floor he sees the bodyguards gun
he kills the lighter and dives for it
in the darkness we hear the struggle
it ends quickly
when the lighter flicks back on v is holding it and the gun
oh god what do you want
ive come to offer you a choice
what what did you call me
protheros heart begins to pound
that was your title at larkhill
you remember larkhill dont you commander
a sign reads larkhill resettlement camp
where they sent the undesirables
a caged truck packed with minorities rolls into the gates which are topped with spools of razor wire
prothero is sweating
i dont know what youre talking about
maybe i can help your memory
larkhill opened in the summer of
you were appointed it commander
you wore a uniform in those days
you looked very good in it
prothero admires his uniform in the mirror
you were a man of many responsibilities
you made sure larkhill made all its quotas especially the oven quotas even though they required an excessive amount of maintenance
we see a detail of black and indian men shoveling mounds of black ash from a series of furnace like ovens
as the shovels lift we see blackened bones and burnt skulls
prothero saunters through the lines of camp prisoners
but there was one task you took to with exceptional relish
remember the medical block commander
i believe you called it the funny farm
you were the one that selected the prisoners
you hand picked each one
prothero steps in front of a woman who remains beautiful despite the suffering she has endured
as the guards grab her we become aware of a man that is staring at prothero
he is one of the prisoners but we do not see his face
prothero notices the man
he doesnt like the way the man is staring at him
prothero is terrified
youre him arent you
oh my god
what are you going to do
you gave us a choice remember commander
you said we could cooperate with the doctors or
v cocks the gun
hold out your hand
trembling prothero sticks out his hand
v lets the light die for a moment
when he flicks it back on prothero is holding a long metal syringe filled with a murky liquid
oh no no
please i was just doing what i was told
of course you were
now im telling you to make a choice
either you stick that syringe into your neck or he presses the gun barrel to protheros forehead
i can kill you right now
prothero begins to blubber
crying doesnt help commander
i remember there was a woman who had been screaming for two days
you winked at the doctor and laughed all in the name of science
please dont make me do this
its a difficult choice isnt it
certain death versus something that might be
but you never know
there is still a chance
you could survive
look at me
now times up commander
anger galvanizes his fear and steadily prothero lifts the needle towards his neck
ill see you in hell
he jams the needle in and sinks the plunger
im quite sure you will
train workers with flashlights hurry through the cars
this doors locked
he slams a shoulder against it and the door gives in
flashlights sweep over the dead bodyguards
the train man hears a strange gurgling rasp and he turns finding prothero in his light
what happened here
prothero is foaming at the mouth while a thick mucus bubbles from his nose
his breath comes in tiny rasps
i need a medic here
prothero becomes more animate trying to tell the man something
hes trying to say something
wheres the goddamn medic
suddenly his body convulses and blood pours out his ears
his body slumps over
i think he needs a priest
the station is swarming with police
a stretcher wheels a body in a black plastic bag out from protheros car
finch puffs on his pipe staring at something spray painted on the wall of the train car a v with a circle around it
what do you make of this mr
dominic finchs younger assistant is holding a flower in his rubber gloved hand
its a rose
a violet carson i believe
i didnt think they still existed
finch turns as a soldier with a radio steps into the car
sir they want you at headquarters sir
im to transport you immediately
send the rose to the lab
also scrape a sample of this paint and have it analyzed as well
ill be back as soon as i can
the door opens and finch steps in
i sent for you because what i have to say cannot be said over a phone or a radio
what i have to say cannot leave these four walls
do i make myself clear
i believe in a few things mr
i believe in god
i believe in the destiny of the nordic race
and i believe in fascism
the romans invented fascism
they had a symbol for it a bundle of twigs bound together
one twig could be broken but a bundle would prevail
that is the heart and soul of fascism
strength in unity
i tell you these things knowing full well that they make you uncomfortable
you have in fact expressed your discomfort in several arrest reports arrests that were in your opinion unnecessary
the fact that you are here that you are not rotting in a prison cell is a mark of my respect and admiration for you for your craft and for
what you have done for this country
finch looks at the ground
it is also because i know you finch
i know what you are
youre a man like me
a man who understands when they are given a job what must be done
i understand you finch and that is why i can trust you
he moves in close to finch
this terrorist knows us finch
these attacks are perfectly calculated and they are divisive
he knows what hes doing finch
he knows us all too well
you think hes an insider
what i think is that this man must be stopped
stopped at all costs and no one i repeat no one is to be placed above suspicion
do i make myself clear
england prevails mr
evey alone in the shadow gallery stares up at the inscription above the crooked staircase
v v v v v
i hear your summons my lady
she jumps v suddenly appearing behind her
oh v you scared me
she turns back to the carving
i was reading the inscription
what is it
a latin quotation
vi veri veniversum vivus vici
by the power of truth i while living have conquered the universe
yes i suppose you have
this place is the only universe i have right now
does that bother you
i dont know
im so grateful to you i just feel i should help you you know the way youre helping me
i mean thats the deal isnt it
v drifts over to the big old wurlitzer fingers scanning the song list
no deals evey
not unless you want them
she looks up at the inscription as an old blues song begins to play
i think i do
part of me wants to stay here forever and never have to face whats going on outside
but thats not right
thats not taking responsibility
not conquering my universe
she turns to him
i want to help you v
i want to do something
can we make a deal
i think we can make a deal if you like
i think i know a way you could help me very soon indeed
evey smiles nervously
thats that then
the blues song curls in the air around them like a heavy incense
v you said that latin thing was a quote
who said it
nobody youd have heard of
a german gentleman named dr
he spins her
he made a deal too
the church doors have opened with the flow of parishioners as the final mass of the day has ended
the tide slowly pours out onto the sidewalk separating around the clumps of people that conglomerate to network and gossip
church bells toll in the orange dusk above them
helen heyer a woman whose spite and guile are hidden behind her looks and clothes she drapes them with charges into the gossipers her trophy husband in tow a timid
looking man that we recognize as conrad heyer
derek how helens head snaps over at the mention of the name
she pushes past conrad giving derek almond an exuberant kiss on both cheeks
darling how are you
always behind her husband rosemary almond smiles nervously as she straightens her drab church dress
its so good to see you
since this bloody terrorist business the old man has me literally chained to the office
helen pouts at him
oh you poor dear
derek taps the bottom of his cigarette box drawing one with his lips
it comes with the job
how are things in the eye conrad
well weve been working some bugs out of the new mark ix fiber optic network actually oh conrad dont be such a bloody bore
do tell us about the terrorist derek
is it true he blew up big ben and the old bailey
im afraid so
were dealing with a pathological psychotic in the most extreme case
well catch him though
helen rubs her white sable against her body
oh it sounds dreadfully exciting
arent you glad youve got such a ruthless implacable brute for a husband rosemary
yes well believe me youre lucky
you could be struck with a professional peeping tom like conrad
englands highest paid voyeur arent you darling
helen i think wed better oh yes of course
we have to get back so the little pervert can watch what the neighbors do after sunday lunch
hes so exciting
derek laughs as they climb into their car
rosemary waves as it pulls off
shes a bit hard on him isnt she
derek sneers at her
until youre half the woman of helens sophistication id keep your little mouth shut
he throws the cigarette at her feet
really just look at the way you dress
from above a hand sweeps aside the red plush curtain
ah there they go
my happy and contented flock
spiritually refreshed and ready to face the world again
bishop anthony lilliman is a slender man of pious elegance with a warm beautiful smile
he turns from the window to his valet dennis as derek and rosemary get in their car
did you enjoy the sermon today dennis
very inspiring your grace
though the segue of the forces of satan among us did strike me as a bit of a curious digression
he whisks a lint brush over the bishops robes before putting them away
a trifle purple i thought
still fate wanted it included and who are we to question the will of the almighty miserable sinners that we are
a gentle smile spreads across his mouth
and speaking of sin i wonder which of the seven deadlies the good lord will see fit to tempt me with today
dennis finishes with the bishops robes and sweeps the closet door shut
perhaps pride your grace
i was thinking of something a little less ethereal
has the young lady arrived
the agency informed me shell be here directly
however there was a mixup
its not one of the usual girls
shes a little older
not too old i trust
they promise me shes no more than fifteen
the bishop rubs his cheek ponderously
ah well if job could bear his disappointments i suppose i must have the good grace to bear mine
show her in when she arrives
yes your grace
a pair of headlights melt through the heavy nights fog as a taxicab pulls into the circle drive
dennis peers into the bishops living quarters
the young lady your grace
standing next to dennis is evey wearing a frilly pink summer dress pigtails and bows and white ruffled socks
and to think i doubted your loveliness for even an instant
mea culpa my child mea culpa
you are a vision
evey smiles awkwardly
a shadow begins moving across the manicured grounds borne on the thick mist like a dark phantom
v glides toward the rectory cloak undulating against the dark wet wind
it is extravagantly furnished somewhere between posh and pimp
the bishop is sitting very close to evey on his plush water bed
of course hate the sin love the sinner
i always say
take your dress off please
evey stammers backing up along the bedside
listen i was kind of hoping he paws at her groping hands pushing the front of her dress down as she backs up against the nightstand
no the guards look out into the night fear suddenly gripping their faces
v emerges demonically through the parting veils of fog the white smiling mask bobbing eerily up and down as he rushes them
a cigarette drops from the first guards mouth red embers exploding when it hits the wet cement
close as the two guards claw for their arms and the white hot flash of vs knives that slice like talons
the two men crumple to the ground clutching their gaping gurgling wounds
v sprints into the courtyard
evey grabs a metal table lamp and swings it down on the bishops head
there is a shuddering clank and he collapses to the floor
you you filthy whore
his blood speckles the white bearskin throw rug as the bishop slowly rises after the retreating evey
ill kill you you fucking sow
he charges after her but freezes dead in his tracks as v swings around the corner in front of him
who please allow me to introduce myself
im a man of wealth and taste
instantly the point of one of vs knives is against the bishops throat
v presses a finger to his frozen smile
it isnt polite to disturb the dead on their journey
evey watches from around the corner
a courtesy ill most respectfully extend to his grace
lilliman swallows audibly
v what are you doing
vi veri veniversum vivus vici evey
evey looks down at the knives on his belt dripping blood
she begins backing to the door
you cant kill him
death has followed his grace the whole of his career
is it any coincidence it has finally followed him here
oh god v
i cant i cant v turns back to lilliman as evey runs
let us pray
evey sprints past the dead guards at the man gate and into the fog
a cramped control room that looks like something between a radio and television switching room though it does not broadcast
two operators sit at the main substation as the sounds of lovemaking come over the speakers
the moans are stifled and low however as if they were afraid someone was listening
doesnt anybody fuck with feeling anymore
operator does not look at him scrolling through an intricate city map on his computer
hey its sunday
childrens hour over at the abbey
lets see what that filthy old pervert is up to
operator punches in some coordinates and the sound over the speakers changes to a garbled fart of noise
two voices drown beneath a cacophony of classical music
what the he tries to dial out the background and suddenly the voices rise clearly above the din
and i saw a black shape against the flames
the man from room five
youve come to collect whats mine
i beg you
i dont want to die
please have mercy
the two men look at each other operator lunging for a red phone
get me the finger
this is an emergency
close on a stain of white vomit and blood on the thick pile of a persian rug
it is encircled in police chalk
pull back to reveal the chalk outline where the body of bishop lilliman was found
the circled bloodstain floats above the head like the last word balloon of a crude comic strip character
the bishops quarters is slowly being picked over by a forensic team from the nose
a photographers flash bursts against a painted v on the wall near the body outline
at the window finch chews on his pipe staring at a plastic evidence bag that contains a single violet carson rose
no prints yet sir
just like prothero
i want those tapes from the ear in my office tonight dominic
theyre on top of it
finch turns to a muscular man named creedy second in command at the finger
any word from your superior mr
almond doesnt seem to be answering his page sir
im sure hes in the field
grunting like an animal dereks face is frozen locked in the rigor of a violent orgasm
after a moment he collapses beside helen onto the sweat soaked sheets
there you go baby
now my baby boy can think so much clearer
she grabs her cigarette case and her lighter
you have been thinking havent you
she straddles his chest then lights two cigarettes
i know you have
ever since this terrorist appeared
he smiles as she puts one of the cigarettes in his mouth
oh jesus that smile
that smile turns me on like nothing else
she whispers in his ear
tell me whats going on in that ruthless sadistic brain of yours
everyone is so worried about the terrorist
you know why
because nobody knows what hes going to do
he exhales through his grinding teeth
if i were him i know what id do
id blow that fat bastard to kingdom come
helen bolts up
he smiles blowing more smoke
theres an old train line under the new government building
it collapsed when they poured the foundation
you could haul in enough tnt to launch our leaders ass all the way to the moon
helens eyes gleam as he laughs
youre serious arent you
he eyes her sucking on the cigarette
you need to be careful helen
your mouth is going to get you into trouble one day
is that the same trouble you love putting in my mouth
you never know who might be listening
i know derek
you love your country and you love your party just like you love your wife
he glares at her
i know i can be a bitch
but thats why youre here isnt it
he smiles again and she presses her body to his
this is it isnt it derek
what weve been waiting for
at last youll be rid of susan
ill be rid of conrad
and well be free
free wont we
his eyes close as he grinds his hips into hers and we rise drifting up to the ceiling light fixture where we see a tiny hidden microphone
finch sits at his desk staring into the silence of his notepad
he has doodled a little v with a circle around it
he looks up as dominic enters holding up a portable cassette player
sorry it took so long
the boys had a devil of a time trying to filter out the background noise
the perpetrator apparently turned on the bishops stereo
subsequently a great deal of the tape is useless
he hands the player to finch
what music did he play
the fifth i believe
da da da dum
for the letter v
finch punches play
over the small speaker we sear evey protesting to v then run
he stops it
anything on the girl yet
the agency said somebody claiming to be lillimans valet canceled his sunday appointment
finch starts it again and this time the tape is very fuzzy
what is it
we recognize some of the words though muted and crackly
though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
it goes on like that for a while
fairly incoherent except we could make out a few words in this part
finch nods understanding
that miracle business when the wafer transform into the body of christ
he made him eat a host
yes listen to this part
the tape becomes somewhat clearer as the music rests
and at the moment this enters your mouth it becomes the flesh of the savior
and whatever it is made of now it will become the body of christ
they eye each other
i want you to swallow it
theres a couple of funny human noises
and then just beethovens fifth
he shuts off the tape
we have got the initial path report back
the host was full of cyanide
finch picks up the bag with the violet carson
and do you know what
he rises sliding into his jacket
when it reached his abdomen it was still cyanide
close on the heavy stitching of a y incision sewn into the chest of a corpse
it is one of the bishops guards
do you have a motive
finch is standing next to the cadaver gurney with the coroner delia surridge
she is a serious woman hair wound tight behind her head in a severe bun
i mean was anything taken
she fills the dead mans head with cotton and replaces the top of his skull
pulling at the mans scalp she stretches it over the replaced skull piece
i know its too early for your profile but do you have any initial impressions
she points at a jagged puncture wound at the base of the mans sternum with a ball point pen
hes incredibly powerful
this mans sternum was split like dry wood from the base all the way up to the manubrium
finch peers into the hole
and hes resourceful
on that table behind you is a breakdown of all the chemicals found in protheros blood stream
finch hefts the pile of computer paper
there were hundreds of different chemicals in him
from trinitrotoluene to estrogen to motor oil
he flips through the document biting into the wooden end of his pipe
perhaps fate will make something more of all this
i certainly cant
the leader finally authorized an uplink for you
he must be getting nervous
government directed terrorism never sews healthy ideas into the public
oh that reminds me
finch pulls the evidence bag from his pocket
can you tell us anything about this
delias eyes lock onto the violet carson
we found one in the carriage with prothero and this one in the bishops quarters
a violet carson
he hands it to her
i heard that strain had died off
thought a botanist might shed some light on it
delia riveted to the rose suddenly looks up to him
yes yes of course
ill drop by tomorrow then
he turns leaving her with the rose
v relaxes with a book in an overstuffed reading chair a violet carson rose resting on a table next to him
he begins to read a passage aloud
there is more behind and inside of v than any of us had suspected
not who but what what is she
he places the book down
thomas pynchons v
v rises lifting the rose and moving into the darkness of the shadow gallery
a small figure moves down the dark wet street the cobblestones glistening like black scales
the huddled figure arcs across the street in the shadows avoiding the pools of streetlight
it is evey a frightened look on her face
a woman in combat boots fishnets and a tight fitting soldiers uniform is in the middle of a cheeky number on stage in this smoky burlesque bar
it is a popular place with locals and fingermen
peter creedy squeezes through the crowd angling for the back of the bar where a number of loud fingermen are drinking
whats all this then harper
i get a radio that a mans down and in need of assistance
i aint gone down yet but i sure do need some assistance
creedy leans in
are you flat broke already
they break up in laughter led by creedy who sits next to harper pouring himself a drink
howd you sneak away creedy
almond off buggering that blonde chippy
the one with the tits
they all begin to hoot and whistle
what i wouldnt give for a piece of that
she could serve a tray of drinks on those thingies
i bet you get your chance with her sooner than later creedy with the way almonds crackin up
bloody buggers losing his marbles
terrorist or no if that bastard gives me another double shift ill stomp his fucking head
creedy raises his drink
this nonsense has put a serious strain on my drinking
i think i was actually sober today
ill drink to that
we need to get a real man of the people in that directors position
like creedy here
everyone cheers in agreement
well its good to know when the shit hits the fan who your real friends are
they salute and drink
derek almond sits hunched under a desk lamp pumping the cylinders of his revolver with a wire brush
rosemary shuffles up to him her frumpy gown gathered around her
derek he blows down one of the cylinders not looking up
i dont want to hear it rosemary
we cant carry on like this
derek stares at the gun rage building
you dont talk to me
you dont eat with me
you dont have sex derek leaps up slugging her
rosemary clatters to the ground in tears
derek glowering over her
i dont have to take any crap from you
i have that fat bastard riding me all day
i dont want to listen to you so shut your fat gob
he leans into her face
and me not wanting to fuck you is obvious
take a look at yourself
he sits back in front of the gun wiping it down
get out of my sight
im cleaning my gun
surridge sits somberly in the dark street light filtering in from the open curtains
her eyes fixed on the violet carson as she slowly turns it over in her hands fingers tracing the soft petals
after a moment she stands letting it fall from her lap
finch turns as dominic bursts in
i got it
dominic waves a printout
larkhill resettlement camp
protheros and lillimans employment records show they both help positions there at similar times
what about codename v
most of larkhills records were destroyed for security reasons but i did uncover an old standard procedures and operations manual
in special case studies medical research groups used roman numerals to identify test inmates
five is the letter v
finch slides in front of his computer
all we need is larkhills employment records
the covers pulled protectively up around her delia rests in a light uneasy sleep
suddenly an eye pops open as she awakens catching a familiar scent
she slowly sits up and inhales
she closes her eyes
its you isnt it
youve come to kill me
from the shadows v answers
tears begin to streak her face
oh thank god
dominic hangs over finchs shoulder as larkhills employment record comes up
finchs mouth falls open
oh my god
row after row of names scroll by at the end of each bio are the words deceased file closed
oh bloody hell
the data banks unfurl like a mass grave
hes killed them all
its not possible
finch stops staring at the one name whose file is not closed oh no
v floats on the edge of the rooms shadows a dark angel
are you afraid
i thought i would be but im not
im she looks at the hovering smiling mask
she starts to cry again
oh god all these years
all this waiting
and somehow i always knew youd come back
delia thinks back
when i saw you that night the night you escaped you were standing against the flames and you looked straight at me
the mask almost nods
i knew then that one day youd come looking for me that youd find me
her voice drops to an almost confessional whisper
what what happened at larkhill
what we did what i did
that terrible knowledge its been with me so long
that i could do things like that
delia rubs the salty tears from her eyes
for years i blamed it on the government on the authority i could never stand up to
but living so long with the knowledge of what i did has made me understand otherwise
i alone was accountable
v watches her
there is something wrong with us
with all of mankind
something evil that made me enjoy what i did
some hideous flaw
her voice almost trails off
we deserve to be culled
we deserve it
light sweeps across rosemary from the opening bedroom door as she sobs softly in bed
derek enters holding a bottle of whiskey and his clean gun
she sits up as derek looms over her
he lifts the gun into her bruised face
her eyebrows cringe as he slowly pulls the trigger
it is empty
dont worry rose
i didnt load it
the phone rings
he grins evilly at her and answers the bedside phone
dereks drunk eyes light up
oh god yes
god thank you
he slams the phone down charging out of the room
a gaggle of drunks exit the bar laughing and singing as they pass a small figure
evey wanders into the bar amidst the lustful screams and cat calls for the line of high stepping semi clothed girls on stage
she stares out into the crowd not sure why she is here when a man approaches her creedy
his sloppy smile indicates he has had a few drinks
you look lost
she looks blankly at him
can i buy you a drink
i made a mistake
she turns for the door
i have to find someone
creedy frowns as his radio crackles
well i didnt like the looks of you anyway all units all units
converge in plaistow to apprehend codename v
he screams to the fingermen at the back
we got him
evey watches as they storm out of the bar then follows
the emergency lights blaring finchs car squeals around a corner
v hovers ghostly at delias bedside
its funny i was given one of your roses today
i wasnt sure you were the terrorist until i saw it
she manages a smile
what a strange coincidence
that i should be given it today
there are no coincidences delia
only the illusion of coincidence
he reaches into his cloak
i have another rose
this one is for you
he hands it to her
then you are going to kill me now
v produces an empty syringe
i killed you ten minutes ago
while you slept
is there any pain
v sits on the bed
she stares at the mask
can i can i see your face again
v slowly pulls off his hat and lifts his mask
delia stares into his face
the rose falls from her hands
v quietly shuts the door as if not to wake her and turns just as derek almond reaches the top of the stairs
dont move an inch you bloody bastard
he trains his gun
you didnt hear me arrive did you
didnt know wed rumbled you
its all finished chummy
all of it
the old man told me it was my head or yours and what do you know
the smiling mask stares
because youre standing over there with your bloody stupid knives and your fancy karate gimmicks derek pulls back the hammer
and ive got a gun
he never loaded it
there is an awkward moment of silence then v moves cloak opening filling the hall like a black tidal wave that envelopes derek
he chokes a scream as v embraces him slipping a knife above his floating rib
derek almond sputters as he claws at vs mask
who who are you
look and tell me what you see
he rips vs mask off as v thrusts the knife in deeper
dereks eyes widen in horror as his life pours out the knife wound
god its horrible
v jerks his blade free letting derek slip to the ground
finchs car bucks up onto the sidewalk
finch and dominic tear out of the car and barrel into the house
at the top of the stairs they find the dead derek
finch rushes past him for the bedroom
inside he finds her
her eyes fixed cold and dead a single violet carson in her lap
get an ambulance
evey rushes around a corner to see a crime scene bathed in siren light
she pushes up to the police barricade as the m
s load a draped body into their van
she tries to angle around to get a better look when a man in a brown overcoat grabs her from behind and drags her into the alley
from the corner of the room finch sits watching as the m
s wheel out delias body
dominic squeezes past the gurney and crosses toward finch
im sorry sir
you knew the doctor pretty well
we found this on her bureau sir
it covers her years at larkhill
it might contain the whole story
dominic searches for something more to say when finch does not answer
after a moment finch looks at the book in dominics hand then takes it leafing through the pages
they flip by a breathy sigh rising to a cold wind
a younger dr
surridge one by one administers a series of injections to her research stock
prothero has hand picked my subjects
four dozen of them none of which will be any use to me if i dont get to work soon
she finishes an injection prothero encouraging the next subject
we recognize her as the woman prothero pointed at
theyre so weak and pathetic i find myself hating them
delia prepares the next dose a sour look on her face
they dont fight or struggle
just stare at you with weak eyes
two inmate orderlies are hefting sacked cadavers from a cart into an incinerator
june th of the original four dozen over are now deceased
strangely no clear patterns have emerged as of yet
another body thuds onto the pile
batch seems to have no common discernible effect on any specific group though the men seem slightly more resilient than the women
when it is full they move to the next door until the cart is empty
im hoping the survivors will provide more answers or my time here will have gone to waste
red heat suddenly glows from the oven vents as the orderly throws a series of switches
surridge moves down the drab aseptic hallway accompanied by an armed guard
roman numerals on the doors to each cell ascend to five
june and only five left now
two men and three women
which tends to contradict my entry on the th
she pauses at room five
the man in room five is a fascinating case
she looks through the small chicken wire glass window in the door
physically there doesnt seem to be anything wrong with him
no cellular anomalies nothing
in the back just on the edge of the rooms shadow sits the man in room five silently staring back
batch five however seems to have brought on some kind of psychotic breakdown
hes quite insane
surridge cant seem to break her stare
he has this way of looking through you
reverend lilliman wont go near him
he claims that it is the devil in room five
i see him cross himself whenever he passes his door
still theres something about him
surridge slowly moves through the larkhill garden an incredible abundance of fruits vegetables and violet carson roses
im glad prothero let room five have a go at the gardening project
he is quite proficient
prothero was reluctant to allow an inmate access to the tool and chemical supply at first but now the fat toad is delighted
the crop has almost doubled
she traces the petals of a rose with her finger
he also grows roses
surridge and several other larkhill appointees relax after dinner
december th i was in the mess
it was about half past ten when we heard the first explosion
a massive explosion shakes the building to its very core its windows shattering and hooded pendulum lights swinging
men and women clutch at their throats as they tumble out into the yard
the ones at the front ran straight into the gas
it was horrible
they drop to the ground gasping and vomiting
the back door is kicked open dr
surridge following two guards
a few of us made it out through the rear door
you could hear men screaming everywhere
i hate the sound of men screaming
she looks out men running collapsing dying in a yellow green haze that seems everywhere
in the center of the camp everything was on fire
everyone running in all directions
we had hardly enough time to get our bearings when the ovens exploded
another explosion wracks the compound
the pillar of flame rises into the black sky dwarfing the men in the camp
surridge sees a gaping hole in the medical block its insides turned out like an unholy birth
it was the man in room rive
i couldnt have known
the chemical supplies grease solvents ammonia fertilizer
hed been making things with them
close on a soldier doubled over hacking up bile
a sticky blue fire licks up from a blackened body like a dura flame
surridge turns as a silhouette crosses the yard backlit by a curtain of fire
and in the yard i saw him
he had the flames behind him
he was naked
the man stops
he looked at me
surridge seems to wilt under his stare but cannot look away
as if i were an insect
as if i were something mounted on a slide
the flames convulse hypnotically behind him
he looked at me
finch snaps dr
surridges journal shut
he sits in front of the leaders desk puffing on his pipe while susan stares coldly
thats the last entry until six months later when dr
surridge is back in london
there is no mention of the man in room five again
end of story
he tosses the journal on susans desk
except that it wasnt the end of the story
finch rises crossing to the wastebasket
between and over forty men and women who were previously stationed at larkhill met with what were believed to be accidental deaths
eventually only three remained
he taps his pipe into his hand pouring the contents into the wastebasket
the three hed been saving until last
finch brushes the ashes from his hands and begins repacking his pipe
everyone who worked at larkhill
everyone who could have identified him
you see there are two possible motives here
susan raises his head
the first is revenge
he escapes from larkhill and vows to get even with his tormentors
the whole exercise an elaborate chilling vendetta
when he finishes repacking the pipe he replaces it in his mouth
thats the explanation that i find most reassuring funnily enough
because that means hes finished
its over now
finch begins relighting his pipe
the second motive is more sinister
like i said everyone who could have identified him is dead
a flame leaps into the air
what if hes just been clearing the ground
what if hes planning something else
the lighter slips back into his pocket
you see the diary we found was in full view
we didnt have to search for it
he left it there
he wanted us to find it
he wanted us to know the story
finch returns to his chair letting out a huge cloud
for all we know the diary could be a complete and utter fake
codename v could have written it himself
finch leans forward
hes playing games with us
he might never have been at larkhill at all
do you see
it could all be another smoke screen a false trail another cover story enough
susan punches the desk
finch would you please explain to me the nature of this meeting
because i was under the impression that you had some information about the terrorist codename v
and punches it again until his fist hurts
no more questions understand
i want answers
i am not interested in where he grew up what kind of flowers he likes or his favorite color
susans collar chokes his face to an unnatural crimson
do i make myself clear
after a moment finch stands susan hanging on his last word
england prevails mr
finch turns susan calling after him as he leaves
finch the girl
do you have anything on the girl
finch pauses at the door
evey stirs as voices drift in from the hall outside her door
wake up cow
three guards are silhouetted in the doorway of a cramped jail cell
still sluggish from the chloroform evey looks down at the coarse slipover shes now wearing
one of the men rossiter crosses toward evey swinging a pair of shackles
he grabs evey slamming her face down into the hard cot driving a knee between her shoulder blades
this pathetic whore is the famous miss hammond
the shackles bite down on her wrists as they laugh in the hall
youve made a mistake
rossiter stands her up shoving her into the wall
i havent done anything he slides a thick hood over her head
i said shut your hole
the hood is lifted from her head
evey squints hard awash in a blinding burning light
a man sits unmoving at a desk across from her a guard at his side both backlit by a harsh white kliegs
eveys eyes start to water as she blinks
do you know why youre here
no please i didnt do anything
allow me to be more precise
did you participate in the murder of dr
did you participate in the murder of derek almond director of the finger
no i did you participate in the murder of bishop anthony lilliman
oh god i dont have you ever participated in a terrorist act against your country
no what is the identity of codename v
i dont know
you are a lying cunt
a monitor next to the desk lights up
from the snowy static an image begins to form
a girl is talking to a man
she is shoving her hips at him propositioning him
when more men appear from the alley evey realizes she is watching herself
they were going to rape me kill me rossiter grabs a handful of her hair
she swallows hard when she sees v emerge on the screen
the image freezes on his smiling face
this board will not tolerate any more of your lies miss hammond
we have over minutes of audio and videotape and pages of testimonials from eye witness that identify you as an accomplice to the terrorist codename v
the monitor blinks off
do you want to know why youre here
you are formally being brought up on charges of murder on fourteen counts and sedition against your leader and country which brings an automatic sentence of death
i didnt do anything
process the prisoner and return her to her cell until she is more cooperative
rossiter slips the hood back over eveys head
evey cries as a rough hand runs a pair of electric clippers over her head
huge sheaves of her hair fall to the ground
evey lies crumpled on the hard floor unmoving as a tray of food is slid through a slot at the bottom of the door
she watches as a rat crosses from a hole in the wall sniffing the murky rendered gelatin in the wooden bowl
evey hangs limply from a set of manacles as she is washed and deloused by heavy hands
she coughs in the yellow bug powder cloud as it burns her eyes and the red welts on her back
evey is curled up on the cot like a dry fetus now gaunt arms wrapped around her legs
she blinks when she hears something moving in the rat hole
evey raises her head as something is pushed through the crevice
tentative fingers search the hole pulling out a length of toilet paper
over every inch of it is a delicately scrawled message
we move into the rathole its edges slowly filling the frame until black
pull back from a shadow the outline of the interrogators silhouette against sharp light coming into frame
i read her letter
they questioned me
and i read her letter again
rossiter is buckling eveys thin arms and legs into a chair
her now frail frame can barely hold up the frayed brown slipover
over and over
on the table in front of her there is a large wash basin of water
rossiter dunks her head into it
her name was valerie
a teacher reads from her lesson plan in front of rows and rows of uniformed pubescences in this all girl private school
her voice drones on and on like muzak
i was born in a rainy burg in nottingham in
i passed my eleven plus and went to girls grammar
a blonde tomboy sneaks a smile to her curly haired friend next to her
i met my first girlfriend at school
her name was sara
her wrists were beautiful
her hand slides across the desk fingers tickling the young flesh of saras wrist
the teachers voice slows dropping octaves becoming a mans voice
i sat in biology class staring at the pickled rabbit fetus while mr
herd said it was an adolescent phase that people outgrew
valerie looks at sara across the room her head down in shame
two teenage girls stand in front of a middle aged couple
they are holding hands
in i stopped pretending and took a girl called christine home to meet my parents
the greying woman repeats the sign of the cross over and over sobbing into a handkerchief
her husbands face is contorted in disgust
a week later i moved to london to go to college and study drama
my mother said i broke her heart
two young women cuddle on a park bench under a london summer sky feeding the pigeons
but it was my integrity that was important
is that so selfish
it sells for so little but its all we have left in this place
the black haired girl nibbles on the blondes ear
it is the very last inch of us
evey struggles against rossiters weight who keeps her head submerged
but within that inch we are free
rossiter wrenches back and evey sucks hard for air coughing out water
now miss hammond let us review the facts
evey stares at him eyes red heart pounding in her ears
you work for codename v
codename v killed delia surridge and then derek almond with your help and that is why you were found outside her home
evey begins to shake her head water sluicing off her thin face
isnt that what happened miss hammond
no that isnt true oh dear rossiter
rossiter grabs eveys neck no wait
plunging her head into the bowl
water fills eveys nose and ears
i was happy in london
the packed house watches as a prince kneels before a womans bare foot with a slipper of glass
i played dandini in cinderella
the woman glances into the dark sea of faces
the world was strange and rustling with invisible crowds behind the hot lights and all that breathless glamour
two women weep in each others arms embracing in a perfect knee high meadow
i got small film roles then bigger ones
the blonde woman brushes away a tear from the others cheek
in i starred in the salt flats
thats where i met ruth
we fell in love
we pull back and see we are on location for a movie and the two women are being filmed
ruth and valerie sit on the couch watching television
on the table behind them is a bouquet of violet carson roses
every valentines day she sent me roses and oh god we had so much
those were the best three years of my life
the two women stare at the newscast in tears the sound of marching coming from the sets speakers
in they came
the sound of marching explodes as columns of men in brown uniforms and jack boots fill the streets
and after that there were no more roses
rossiter presses his elbow onto eveys neck holding her submerged
not for anybody
rossiter lets evey up
her red burnt lungs gulp at the air
after the takeover they started rounding up the gays
they took ruth while she was out looking for food
evey blinks hard black fireworks exploding in her eyes
why are they so frightened of us
she wheezes on the edge of unconsciousness
they burned her face with cigarettes and made her give them my name
she signed a statement saying id seduced her
the interrogators voice melts into a slag heap of sound with the hot rhythmic pounding in her ears
i didnt blame her
god i loved her but i didnt blame her
rossiter uncuffs evey slipping the black bag over her head
but she did
eveys knees buckle as he forces her to stand
she killed herself in her cell
she couldnt live with betraying me with giving up that last inch
evey weaves down the hall
rossiter shoving her from behind
they came for me
they shaved off my hair
they held my head down a toilet and told lesbian jokes
they brought me here and pumped me full of chemicals
the cell door swings open
i cant feel my tongue
i cant speak
rossiter yanks the hood from her head and pushes her in
it is strange that my life should end in such a terrible place but for three years i had roses and apologized to nobody
the iron door slams shut lock ringing in the stale air
i shall die here
every inch of me shall perish
evey rolls to her knees
she crawls for the rat hole
it is small and fragile and its the only thing in the world thats worth having
her shaking hand pulls the letter from the stone crevice
we must never lose it or sell it or give it away
we must never let them take it from us
evey clutches it like a rosary as she begins to cry
i dont know who you are but i hope you escape this place
i hope that the world turns and things get better and that one day people have roses again
she holds the note to her face her tears soaking into the fragile paper
i dont know who you are but i love you
i love you
slowly evey slips away succumbing to blackness
i had come to know every inch of those four walls in that dark hell and they knew every inch of me
loud lights blare against eveys solemn face
a typed document sits on a small tray table in front of her
my name is evey hammond
on the th of november i was abducted by the terrorist known as codename v and then taken against my will to an unknown location
rossiter hovers just behind her as the interrogator reads her confession
once there i was systematically brainwashed by means physical and psychological
i was frequently subjected to sexual abuse during this period
eveys expression is unchanging
eventually i was terrorized into helping him commit the murders of derek almond dr
delia surridge and anthony lilliman bishop of westminster
rossiter drops a pen on the table
i the undersigned swear that the above statement is genuine and that it was not signed by means of intimidation
the pen slowly rocks to a stop
wed like you to sign that for us miss hammond
where weve put the little cross
as you wish
rossiter begins unbuckling eveys restraints
escort miss hammond back to her cell rossiter where she will wait while you arrange a wet detail of six men
he forces evey to her feet
then take her out behind the chemical sheds and shoot her
the door opens behind evey as she rereads valeries letter for the last time
its time unless you want to change your mind
she holds the tattered piece of toilet paper to her chest
sign that statement
you could be out inside three years
perhaps theyd find you a job with the finger
evey closes her eyes
thank you but id rather die behind the chemical sheds
her last words hang in the air
then theres nothing left to threaten you with is there
you are free
he turns and leaves
she listens as his footsteps fade down the hall the door hanging weirdly open
evey takes a few tentative steps toward the door and sticks her head out into the empty hall peering down both ways
slowly she emerges from her cell retracing her path down the hall that her blindfold never allowed her to see
quietly inching along the wall evey peeks around a corner gasping at the rigid guard standing off to the side
there is something about the mans frozen stare that keeps her from running
evey straightens and crosses to the guard
it is a mannequin
she touches him the wheeled platform he is mounted on rolling back against the wall
the door creaks open as evey enters the room where for so long she was questioned and tortured
she crosses to the frozen interrogator sitting at his desk
her finger brushes lightly against the plastic hand then evey raps a knuckle on his hollow wooden head
around his neck a small speaker hangs from a cord
evey drifts uneasily into a back room where a discarded prison guards uniform hangs on a rack
on a table next to a wig and pair of gloves the rat looks up at her through the bars of its tiny cage
she moves through another door the wind suddenly knocked from her chest as she finally sees where her prison was built v steps from the shadows
welcome home evey
her mouth hangs open
you did this
eveys rail thin figure begins to shake
you did this to me
she stumbles against the wall unable to support herself
you you hit me and and cut my hair
it was you
it was just you all this time
she doubles over covering her face as she bursts into tears
you tortured me
you tortured me evey looks up at him body shivering as he quietly glides toward her
oh god why
because i love you evey
because i wanted to set you free
a look of horror twists her starved face
set me free
dont you realize
slender fingers ball into fists
dont you realize what you did to me
you nearly drove me mad
disgust and anger light up her eyes
i hate you
her little wiry body coils tight as she circles him
i hate you
set me free
you put me in a prison to set me free
you were already in a prison
youve been in a prison all your life
i dont want to hear it
i wasnt in a prison
i was happy
i was happy here happiness is the most insidious prison of all evey
thats evil and its wrong
what gives you the right to judge
who are you to say whats not good enough
you were born in a prison evey
i didnt put you there
i just showed you the bars
youve been in a prison so long you no longer believe theres an outside world
she wheels away from him covering her ears trying to get away from his voice
i dont want to hear it
thats because youre afraid evey
youre afraid because you can feel freedom closing in on you
youre afraid because freedom is terrifying
evey falls stumbling through the labyrinth of the shadow gallery
i cant feel anything
theres nothing left to feel
dont you understand
dont back away from it evey
part of you understands the truth even as part pretends not to
she collapses head pounding
woman this is the most important moment in your life
dont run from it
i dont know what oh god i cant breathe v couches next to her
youre almost there
feel the shape of it
what are you doing to me
i cant breathe you were in a cell
they offered you a choice between the death of your principles and the death of your body
he cradles her as she hyperventilates tears streaming down her face
i feel i feel like im going to burst
you said youd rather die
you faced the fear of your own death and you were calm
try to feel now what you felt then
oh god i felt the mask hovers over her
like an angel he squeezes her shuddering body
oh god v im so scared
whats happening to me
the door of the cage is open evey
all that you feel is the wind from outside
dont be afraid
gently he lifts her
try to walk
the lift will take us to the roof
he helps her to an open elevator
i i dont want to be blindfolded
no more blindfolds
the cage in the elevator rattles shut
the two figures stand in the door of the roof access a raging tempest oozing from a split sky
something draws evey out into the storm
slowly she walks beneath it the wind and rain pounding against her thin frame
evey lets the coarse slipover fall to the ground and stares straight up into the storm naked the elements soaking into her very being
v moves up behind her
do you feel it
everythings so different
five years ago i too stared beneath a night like this
naked under a roaring sky
a low rumble of thunder washes over london
the night is yours evey
encircle it within your arms
his words buffet against her with the sheets of rain
bury it in your heart up to the hilt
she raises her arms to embrace the raging torrent
become transfixed and transfigured a jagged bolt of lightning shatters the sky
finch gets out of a police car and looks up the black face of the modern building
he sighs and taps his pipe against the heel of his shoe
finch turns to find dascombe hurrying towards him
do you know what this is all about
no but i can guess
remember remember the fifth of november
oh come on
hes long gone
he has to be
he did what he came to do and its over
finch chews on his pipe
not for us
he turns and heads into the building
a dark november sky hangs like a shroud over the building
a year gentlemen
the heads of each department are gathered around a table of black granite
peter creedy sitting back out of the lights is the new head of the finger
i have given you almost a year and you have given me nothing
he glares at finch
now adam there is no one better than finch and you know it
dascombe i do know it
it is that very fact that keeps me awake at night wondering if perhaps there is a reason that mr
finch has failed
what are you saying
im saying that perhaps i dont know you as well as i thought i did
are you asking for my resignation
no i am asking for some goddamn results
its not finchs fault adam
weve all been looking
the man simply disappeared
hes gone adam
the leader trembles like a volcano set to blow
its over is it
vanished you say
the leader grabs a large box from the floor and hurls reams of computer printout across the table
transcripts recorded over the last thirty days in which the terrorist was talked about or mentioned in a positive context
this is only thirty days
he punches a play button and a wall of monitors blink on
it is a recording of a television variety show
a character that is made to look like adam susan is giving a speech
a woman is dressed like v except that the only thing she is wearing under her cloak is a garter belt stockings and high heels
v sneaks up behind susan and yanks his pants down
susan is outraged but when he gives chase he trips over his pants
the audience hoots and howls
the leader kills the tape
is this what you consider disappeared
for gods sake adam its a stupid variety show
creedy i want the producers writers and actors of that stupid variety show arrested and charged with sedition
you cant be serious push me roger push me and youll find out how serious i am
he stares each of them to silence
this this v is still out there
i can feel him like a sickness worming its way into the hearts and minds of the public
something must be done and done quickly to exorcise this demon for the very soul of this country is at stake
that is why i am compelled to give each and every one of you notice that if by the fifth of november you are still giving me nothing more than
excuses i will have to revoke your party status and terminate your positions
everyone is stunned
creedy i will speak with you in private
the rest of you are dismissed
the leader stands at the window
creedy as the new head of the finger you are the most important member of my cabinet
i uh appreciate your faith in me
your predecessor mr
almond was a good man a man who understood what strength in unity meant a man who above all loved his country
i need to know if you are such a man
his eyes bore into him
do you love your country mr
a police car is parked in a dark alley
it is raining and the windows of the car are completely steamed
oh god yes
he is sweating his knuckles white as he squeezes the steering wheel panting
we hear a noise like a very wet kiss and then a womans voice
the most important member of my cabinet
yes it is isnt it dear
helen lifts her head out of his lap
her lipstick is smeared about her mouth
oh dont stop
i stop when you stop
what did he say next
i cant she whispers in his ear while playing with his lap
come on peter what are you afraid of
almond used to tell me everything and youre twice the man he was
he asked me
if i loved my country
oh yes i can tell you do love your country almost as much as you love this
she lowers her head into this lap
then he asked me to do something
helen i cant
i cant tell you
helen lifts her head
he told you to frame someone as the terrorist
how did you know that
i know adam susan
now who was it
i cant tell you that
yes you can honey
you can and you will
you have to trust me love
were going to help each other
look at that face
youre just bursting to tell me
her head drops back down
now who was it
the name seems to orgasm from his mouth
finch sits alone in his modest apartment reading a book
the book is koesterlers the roots of coincidence
an old cd player is playing music a bach piano concerto
v is playing the exact same concerto on his piano his gloved fingers gracefully flitting across the keys
evey enters the gallery
her hair has grown out but is still short
she projects a kind of strength that comes from a deep inner peace
v coaxes the final delicate notes and lets them softly fade
that was beautiful
she walks up to him and takes the smiling face in her hands
ive wanted to do this for a long time
she bends and gently kisses the frozen lips
thank you v
thank you for everything youve done for me
you did it all yourself evey
i just provided the backdrop but the drama was all your own
it was a good backdrop
i believed it
i really did
its still a bit hard for me to accept that it wasnt real
that it was just you
especially the letter
she takes the letter from her pocket
it is a beautiful letter v
every time i read it i could feel valerie almost like she was holding me
i believed in her most of all
i believed that she loved me and i loved her back
she looks down
i feel a bit foolish telling you this
i know that you must have written it and thought you should have it back
but i didnt write that letter evey
come with me
it is a shrine
the walls are covered with movie posters and reviews and pictures of an actresses named valerie page
we recognize her as the woman chosen for the medical block just before v
everywhere there are flower boxes filled with blooming roses violet carsons
she was the woman in room four
she wrote the letter just before she died
i delivered it to you as it was delivered to me
the words you wept over were the same words that transformed me
evey smiles and bends to smell the roses
you grew them for her
evey do you know what day it is
two days before the first day we met
youre planning something arent you v
you know me too well now
what are you going to do
im going to fulfill an old promise
evey cocks an eyebrow
ill show you
carrying a lantern v leads evey down a dark stone staircase
ive never been here before
it is the deepest part of my home
once you know it i should think youll know everything
he pushes a button and a secret passage opens in a heavy stone wall
there is a small narrow series of passageways that he guides her through leading to another door
evey steps out into an underground subway station
parked beside the concrete platform is a beautiful antique train car
oh v its lovely
where on earth did you find it
in a way i suppose it really found me
evey steps into the train car and finds it filled with little packages wrapped in wax paper
whats in these packages
she screams and almost drops one
what are you going to do with all of it
i told you
im going to finish what was started four hundred years ago
where does this train go
this is the old victoria line but it is blocked blocked somewhere between whitehall and st
v thats the new government building
but the underground has been shut down for years
how are you going to make it run without any power
i just thought i might ask them to turn it on for me
the leader sits bathed in the flickering images of the fate computer
everythings set sir
on one of the screens a television program has just begun
tonight on tales from the bible a story of treachery and betrayal from the book of daniel
we cut from that screen to another screen the television studio where roger dascombe surveys a large bank of monitors filled with the images of typically vapid television entertainment
all of londons waiting
and here we go a player locks on as a recorded program begins
we move in as the logo slashes across the screen storm saxon
tonight englands greatest hero repels the forces of darkness in a brand new episode
we pull back from the shows opening teaser and find ourselves looking at a small television
in the delivery bay at the back of jordan tower five security guards are riveted to the heroic actions of storm saxon
you mongrel trash if you harm her
look out de white debil has a laser lugar
behind them a shadowy figure in a cloak and tall hat enters the loading bay
hey what the
they all turn and find a smiling v
they go for their weapons
v goes for them
it is brutal and quick knives slicing in bloody arcs bodies kicked and thrown with superhuman power
the tv crashes to the ground and we move in at it as storm saxon stands triumphant beside his buxom lass
oh storm hold me
hold me tight
we pull back on another television screen inside dominic is chewing on a hamburger engrossed in storm saxon
across the room finch is reading the roots of coincidence
i dont know how you stand that tripe
dominic answers with a mouthful of cheeseburger
finch shakes his head reaching for his pipe
he realizes he is out of tobacco
he slides open the bottom desk drawer and his eyes almost pop out of his head
he stares into the drawer like someone staring at his own tombstone
finch whats wrong
slowly he lifts something from the drawer
on his desk he lays out several knives a cloak a hat and a smiling mask
what the hell
finch lifts the mask and almost has to laugh
dont you see dominic
he puts the mask to his face
v emerges from an elevator and immediately attacks several more guards
a surveillance camera watches as v steps over their slumped broken bodies
the security guard sees v on the monitor coming directly down the hall
he grabs the machine gun aiming it just as v kicks open the door
at least five guards have trained their weapons on him
he is surrounded
slowly he lifts his arms as though surrendering
his cloak opens revealing enough tnt to level the entire building
in his hand is the plunger detonator
the door bursts open as creedy and a group of heavily armed fingermen muscle in
what the hells going on
im here to arrest mr
finch for acts of treason and terrorism
you cant be serious
if i were you boy id shut my hole unless you want to start explaining why you didnt say nothing about mr
finchs secret identity
v follows roger dascombe into the main control booth
the door shuts behind them and they are alone
all around them are the laugh tracks and gunshots of the evenings entertainment
v puts his hand into his cloak and pulls out a videotape
he hands it to dascombe
finch glares at creedy
why dont you just shoot me creedy
wouldnt that make everything a lot simpler
yeah i suppose it would
creedy smiles his finger tightening on the trigger when holy christ
creedy you stupid ape
if finch is v then tell me who is that
he points at the television where v sits calmly at a desk in front of the vtv logo
good evening london
bloody fuckin hell
i thought it was time we had a little talk
he has to be at jordan tower
finch and dominic rush out of the room
creedy looks at his confused men
dont just stand there
v smiles at the horrified adam susan
are you sitting comfortably
then ill begin
the leader screams pounding on fate
he hits the intercom
lieutenant ready my transport
i want every armed man within a hundred miles at jordan tower
we move in at vtv
right now i imagine there are hundreds of soldiers rushing here to kill me because someone does not want us to talk
we pull back in a family watching television
in the background two children are squabbling
turn it up
the husband does
vs voice gets louder as we move towards him
they are afraid that i am going to say the things that are not supposed to be said
they are afraid that i am going to say the truth
a man sits on his couch mesmerized by v
the truth is that there is something terribly wrong with this country isnt there
if you look about you witness cruelty injustice and despotism
but what do you do about it
what can you do
he pops his beer tab and the beer foams over the couch but he doesnt seem to notice
the car races wildly towards jordan tower as finch and dominic listen to the broadcast on the radio
you are but a single individual
how can you possible make any difference
individuals have no power in this modern world
that is what youve been taught because that is what they need you to believe
but it is not true
the leader seethes staring at three television monitors in his limo which are all filled with v
this is why they are afraid and the reason that i am here to remind you that it is individuals who always hold the power
the real power
individuals like me
and individuals like you
the bar is almost completely soundless except for the voice of v
people stare at the television as if the moment were somehow suspended in time
i have come to offer you a deal
if you accept i will give you a different world
a world without curfews without soldiers and surveillance systems
a world that is not run by other men but that is run by you
i am offering you a second chance
the military forces have begun to swarm
four hundred years ago a great citizen made a most significant contribution to our common culture
it was a contribution forged in secrecy and stealth although it is best remembered in noise and bright light
a crowd has gathered watching through the window
to commemorate that glorious night at precisely the stroke of midnight the edifice of their world will erupt with enough sound and fury to shake the earth
all i ask is that you join me at the gates to watch as the past is erased the pathway cleared so that together we can start toward a new
the leader climbs out of his limo and is met by one of his captains
i want this man dead
i want him shot on sight
finch can see the forces gathering outside jordan tower
but you ask who am i to make such promises
a fair question but hardly necessary as you know me already
to know me any more you need only look to a mirror
finch catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror
vtv fills every screen
truth be told this wasnt even my idea was it
if you think back youll remember that night whispering in your lovers arms
i became a part of your plan just as you have now become part of mine
give me the line of the queen and ill give you your secret dream
a heavy battering ram is rushed down the hall carried by four soldiers
on the twelfth stroke of the fifth day of the eleventh month i hope we shall all meet again
the crowd is much larger
until then i bid you goodnight
every screen suddenly goes black
the crowd turns to each other unsure of what to do
the door explodes open
v is standing alone almost as if waiting for them
before he can even move they shoot
machine gun fire lights up the room
vs body dances and jerks backward smashing through an observation window falling to the television stage below
a path is cleared for the leader
as he heads into the television studio an armed soldier is heading in the opposite direction
it is impossible to tell because of the dark face plate but it looks like the soldier is smiling
the leader shoves his way onto the main stage
a group of soldiers is gathered around the body
who was it
who was he
the mask is pried off revealing the lifeless face of roger dascombe
to the leader it is an obvious revelation
it makes such perfect sense
sir i think there has been a mistake
there is no mistake
but sir there are people that say they saw both the terrorist and dascombe together who
who are these people
they must be detained immediately
whatever they saw or whatever they think they saw is subordinate to the truth and that truth is that roger dascombe is the terrorist and the terrorist is dead
but i thought i was the terrorist
finchs voice stops the leader cold
finch what are you doing here
since im not in jail and since you have another even more convenient suspect
im guessing the charges have been dropped
be careful finch
i am careful sir
that is why i suggest that a search of this building begin immediately
the terrorist is dead
with all due respect i disagree and i believe that he is presently trying to get out of this building disguised as one of us
are you challenging my authority
no sir im trying to run an investigation i am trying to run a country
when i tell you mr
finch the terrorist is dead then the terrorist is dead
if you continue to suggest otherwise then you will leave me no choice but to have you arrested on charges of sedition
do i make myself clear
he eyes the room
everyone is silent
now it is imperative for the people of london to know that they are safe that the terrorist is dead and everything is under control
the leader storms past finch who looks at dascombe and bites down on his pipe
one of the ears black vans has been modified with large speakers wired to the roof
as the van rolls down the street the speakers drone with a looped message
the terrorist is dead
no further threat exists
everything is under control
out of the back soldiers hurl leaflets that swirl and flutter in the vans wake
the little girl on the bicycle that we saw earlier stops and picks up one of the leaflets
it has a picture with the body of roger dascombe beneath the headline the terrorist is dead
london is safe once again
she crumbles the leaflet and throws it
she gets off her bike and takes something out of the backpack
hes not dead
its all bollocks
turning to a nearby wall she spray paints a large circle around a v
a recording of vtv plays on the small television
if you give me the line of the queen ill give you your secret dream
dominic freezes the image v stares at them smiling
play it again
come on finch
weve seen it fifty times
i mean after what they done to you i dont know why were even trying to stop him
finch stares out the window
i dont know
for twenty seven years ive been at this job
twenty seven years ive done what ive been told to do
maybe thats all there is to it
im just a dumb old dog
a dumb old dog that only knows one trick
that aint it finch
its more than that
i know you
its something personal with this one
and maybe im not ready for a revolution
well we got less than thirty hours to stop it
its on the tape
i know it
i can feel it
he did this for a reason
he needs something
the line of the queen
but what does that mean
maybe its a line from shakespeare
or a book
i dont know
he rewinds and starts the tape
this wasnt even my idea was it
but right here
hes talking to someone
someone who knows what he wants
if you think back youll v continues on a different television
remember that night whispering in your lovers arms
helen heyer is lying on her bed eating chocolates watching v through calculating eyes
at her feet we hear a suckling noise that suddenly stops
helen why did you want that tape
shut up conrad
she shoves her foot back into his mouth and he continues to suck on it and each of her toes
now youve become a part of mine
how did you know that
conrad moves up her ankle licking and kissing his way to her knee
know what my love
give me the line of the queen and ill give you your secret dream
she freezes the tape
her eyes light up and she smiles back at him
you have a deal
conrad licks along the inside of her thigh until she slaps him
here you can have a chocolate
she shoves the candy in his mouth
as for the rest of the box perhaps when youre leader
right now i need something else conrad
i need you to use that pretty little brain for me
you know all about the old underground dont you
he nods still gagged with the candy
i need to know everything understand
there are cameras set in front of the large black leather chair so that the flashing images and data of the fate computer system can be seen behind the leader
a makeup artist mattes down the leaders lipstick
ready in five leader
the makeup artist adjusts one last hair and scurries off
in four three
he points and the cameras red light goes on
the same family the same squabbling children watching as a special bulletin interrupts a laugh track
good evening london
as leader of this great country i felt it imperative to speak with you and to assure you once and for all that the shadow that recently fell across our
land has indeed passed
oh for fucks sake
no one is watching
what we have endured this long year was no accident no mere coincidence
this was not a simple act of terror conducted by a singular madman
no this was a test
a drunk struggles up onto his bar stool blocking the tv
it was not me nor the party nor the government that was threatened this year
it was our beliefs
i believe that god himself bore witness to our struggle and like job i believe that we have been vindicated
the drunk raises his glass
remember fifth of november
the bar cheers
the leader reaches for his bible
how do i know this
let me read to you where i found the answer where i so often find the answer
in the scripture
the megaphones blast the leaders voice
if any man have an ear let him hear
there are stacks of printout everywhere
he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword shall be killed with the sword
here is the patience and faith of the saints
finch stops reading listening to the radio
and i beheld another beast coming out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon
another radio crackles with the leaders voice
and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men
v nods almost laughing as evey enters the gallery
and he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had the power to do oh v turn it off please
of course my dear
he reaches over and changes the frequency
we hear voices hushed and secret but we recognize them
but how does he know
i dont know
all i know is he does
and i know what he wants
the voices are labored punctuated by gasps and moans
what is that v
that evey is what i have been waiting for
do you know what i want
i want you just like this
bent over that black leather chair
we are pulled by the radio into where we see a tiny microphone hidden in the ceiling light above the bed
helen moans as we drift down glimpsing helen her arms reaching for the edges of the bed her back arching up towards creedy behind her smiling
what about conrad
i told you ill handle conrad and v will take care of susan
the mob will take care of the guard and then
you can use the finger to take over
use the finger
you mean like this
he inserts a finger into her
that is vulgar
but you like it
yes oh yes oh youre a pig peter
that i am misses
but im the pig thats gonna be running this country
that sends a shiver through helens body
yes and im
im going to be eva
her eyes close and her fists knot the sheets
dont cry for me argen
the word is almost lost in her orgasm
the sun rises over london
it is the morning of the fourth
finch looks through the blinds at the morning sun
he has been up all night
he checks his watch am
rubbing the knot in his neck he turns back to his office which is now buried beneath mounds of paper
dominic is passed out sprawled on the couch and clutching a printout from spencers fairy queen
dominic jumps immediately searching the printout
dominic go home
but ive still got over three hundred lines from the fairy queen
theres no more time
you go home and get some rest
youre going to need it tonight
dominic lets the papers fall to the floor
hes got us doesnt he finch
yes he does
conrad pulls his car into his reserved space
helen holds conrads chin the way a mother holds a child when she is telling them something important
now listen to me conrad
this is the most important moment of our lives
everything ive worked and hoped for comes to this
susan is a very dangerous man especially now thats why i need you conrad
i need you to be stronger than him
i need you to be the better man
if you do this conrad and you do it right im going to turn you from the little man i married into the man of my dreams
he embraces her to kiss but she turns her perfectly painted lips
not on the lips
ardently he kisses her cheek
finch sits alone palms pressed to his bleary eyes
give it up old man
youre not even sure you want to stop him
with a red pen he begins absently drawing red circles around any v he sees on any piece of paper
words from quotes and lists
suddenly he stops
carefully as if reaching to touch a butterfly he slips a single sheet out from the sheaves covering his desk
the paper has a long list the names of all the queens of england
he has circled in red the v in victoria
when it hits him it hits him like a falling safe
its got to be it
the intercom clicks on
heyer is here to see you
says its urgent
and hes here with his wife sir
sir yes sir wait you cant go the door slaps open
leader im terribly sorry but i absolutely must speak with you
the leader waves the lieutenant off
i have something to tell you something important but she glances at conrad
i can tell you and only you
the leader studies her
it is a matter of national security
in his car finch races to a corner and slams on the brakes
he gets out staring at a shadow on the ground a v in a circle
the shadow is cast by a sign for victoria station part of the abandoned subway
the gates are chained shut
he fires his pistol into the lock kicks open the rusting gates and descends into the underground
the leader closes the door behind them
now whats this all about mrs
please forgive me
ive been so afraid afraid to come here to talk to you
i thought he must know
i was terrified he knew but i had to come because i knew you were the only one that can protect me
protect you from what
she is unable to go on seemingly about to burst into tears
come now mrs
he touches her and it is all she needs
she buries her face into his chest
you wont let him hurt me will you
let who hurt you
the terrorist is dead
oh how i wanted to believe it leader but i know its not true
because i know who the terrorist is
conrad is alone with fate
he glances about nervously moving closer and closer
his fingers reach out and graze the main keyboard
taking a deep breath he turns and begins to type
the leader takes hold of helen by her shoulders
who is it woman
its conrad leader
my husband is the terrorist
conrad accesses the department of water and power
he finds the correct file and begins rerouting power to a once dead system
a hanging light suddenly sizzles to life
v looks up smiling
the leader stares hard at helen
how do you know
i saw him leader
in the middle of the night
i heard something
i went to the landing and thats when i saw it
she clutches him
that hideous smiling mask
but how did you know it was heyer
i know leader
i know the way a woman knows
but you have no proof
this is an extremely delicate situation mrs
it has been reported that the terrorist is dead
it would be a catastrophe to arrest a man now without concrete conclusive proof
do you have any evidence at all
tears well up in helens eyes as she shakes her head
but if youre right if heyer is indeed the terrorist
his eyes fly wide and he spins away from her throwing open the door
conrad sits calmly across the room
is everything all right
heyer your wife has done her duty to her country
he turns to helen
dont worry mrs
you will be taken care of
i will launch an immediate investigation and i promise you will be the first to know when an arrest will be made
investigation of what
your wife was privy to the dialogue of subversives
thats all you need to know at this time
the lieutenant appears almost instantly
the heyers are leaving
i need to see mr
creedy at once
helen looks up at the leader a smile hidden near the corners of her perfect red lips
thank you sir
the leader nods
helen and conrad get out of the elevator standing beneath the rows of new party flags that line the lobby
i want you to go straight to your office and wait for me to call
when i do i want you to come immediately home
she embraces him pressing her body against his
oh conrad im so proud of you
i did it helen
i did it didnt tonight conrad
i promise you will never forget tonight
she almost kisses him
smiling she pivots on her heel and heads for the door
he reaches for her when mr
the front desk guard rushes towards him
sir this package arrived for you sir
he hands him a small brown wrapped box
he looks back for helen but she is already gone
a single flashlight beam creeps toward us as finch searches the detritus of the dead train line
sitting at a stoplight conrad decides to open the package
inside is a cassette tape
the light changes and a car behind him honks
he starts forward and inserts the tape
finch crawls up onto the platform of vs hidden station staring at the beautiful old train car
strangling the steering wheel conrad listens to the tape
the speedometer climbs as everything seems to accelerate
do you know what i want
i want you just like this
bent over that black leather chair
finch steps inside the car his flashlight sweeping over the stacks of gelignite
oh my god
a scream builds in conrad
with tears in his eyes he stares out the windshield but sees only the images created by the tape
use the finger
you mean like this
but you like it
conrad loses control and the car careens up onto the sidewalk and smashes into a brick wall
lifting his bloodied forehead conrad looks out and sees the ubiquitous poster partially destroyed by the crash strength through purity purity through faith
finch hears something and jerks back almost falling out of the car
aiming his gun he finds no one
he turns and bolts
as the sound of his footsteps fade v steps out of the shadows
the leaders lieutenant looks up from his desk and sees finch rushing towards him
is the leader in
yes but hes meeting with the captain of the guard
finch you cant go in finch charges through the doors
the leader and his captain turn
leader i need as many men the captain can spare and i need them right now
to capture codename v
creedy opens the trunk of his car
in the phosphorescent glow of the streetlight the set of knives gleam
he bundles the costume that he tried to planet on finch into his arms then slams the trunk
above a window blind that was cracked open snaps shut
the leader moves towards finch
the old subway
i know exactly what hes going to do
if we move quickly we can be there waiting for him
conrad waits hidden inside a bedroom closet
he hears the front door close and his grip tightens around the handle of a long steel necked hammer
the leader is steadily convincing himself of something
leader every second we delay
the leader lifts his hand silencing finch
im coming with you
sir there will be no discussion but if mr
finch is right i am sick to death of this terrorist being everywhere and nowhere
i will judge whether mr
finch is right and i will judge it with my own eyes
do i make myself clear captain
sir yes sir
finch is suddenly overwhelmed by a feeling that is common to chess players
it is the disturbing sense that you have just done exactly what your opponent wanted
is there a problem mr
captain mobilize your men
sir yes sir
well find this bloody bastard and we will finish him
evey sits in the gallery reading pynchons v just as v had done
she suddenly feels v watching her
evey smiles as v steps out of the shadows
v whats going to happen
is it going to be violent
yes i suppose it will
creedy empties a bottom drawer making room to hide the costume
as he does the closet door behind him slowly creeps open
v stands at the jukebox
why must is be violent
because evey that is the nature of change
she is a temperamental creature that appears in earnest rarely but when she does she will wear one of two faces
the first face is the destroyer
it is lamentable but all true change begins with death
a dark figure stands over creedy
the hammer raises a slash of silver against the velvety darkness
v punches a button on the jukebox just as the hammer falls with a sickening soft crunch
the song begins to play a melancholy song that says goodbye to love
blood pours down creedys snarling face he snatches one of vs knives as another hammer blow cracks through his collar bone
he screams lunging at conrad
v listens to the song the smiling eyes somehow knowing
the hammer falls again and again until the metal head is slick with blood and meat
conrad stumbles back dropping the hammer
he looks down at the hilt of the knife protruding from his stomach
he yanks it out and holds vs knife which is bright red with his own blood
he collapses to the floor
the song continues
what is the other face v
the other face
she is the true face of change
the face of the creator
she is the one that remakes the world
may i ask you for a favor
it is a small thing but it would mean a great deal to me
ive never danced before
ive thought about it many times here in this room listening to the music
but ive always been alone
evey smiles and crosses to him
it would be my pleasure
he opens his arms and she steps into them
they dance standing very close his gloved hand holding tightly to hers her smile against his
dozens of military vehicles swarm around the entrance to victoria station while heavily armed men pour through the gates of the underground
the song ends
thank you evey
you are an excellent dancer
all it takes is a little practice
alas i have run out of time
he bows pressing his frozen lips to her hand
evey is suddenly nervous
what are you going to do
dont you remember
i have a date tonight evey
youre coming back though arent you
she seizes hold of his hand
v i wont let you leave unless you promise me that you will come back
of course ill be back
you dont think you can be rid of me now do you
she lets him go
soldiers swarm through the station
susan stares in shock outraged by the mere presence of the train
mark my words mr
finch this man is going to become an example so that every man woman and child in this country will remember what happens to those who would ever think to
stand against the state
he turns to the captain
captain i need a gas unit down here with enough nerve gas to fill every rat hole in these tunnels
suddenly the lights go out
i dont think that will be necessary
the leader smiles
there are over one hundred of the best trained soldiers in this country down here
let him come
five soldiers creep forward in a tight formation their flashlights probing every nook and cranny
behind them a secret passage opens and v steps out
he is among them with frightful speed a grinning dervish with blades like metal fangs ripping and rending flesh slashing bright in the flashlight
other soldiers rush towards the screams and gunfire but they find only five bodies and warm blood running down the walls
captain whats happening
no sign sir
repeat no sign of him
they lost him
from the opposite end there is another series of screams and machine gun fire that lights up the dark tunnel for a moment
this is a mistake
dont tell me youre a coward mr
back in the tunnels v drops from above his cloak a swirling cloud of squid ink that hides him in the darkness
again quicksilver knives lash out drawing fonts of blood
finch can feel the panic that is spreading through the tunnel
leader we have to get out of here
this was your idea
it was a mistake
this is what he wants
he knows us leader
he knows us too well
we have to get out of here before its too late a voice rings out from hidden speakers echoing through the tunnels
good evening citizens of london
this is the voice of fate
what trick is this
tonight the face of london is going to change and i am going to offer you the chance to change with her
your leader is finished
he will not leave these tunnels alive
the leader screams to be heard over the resonant voice of v
this is an outrage
i order you not to listen to this
at midnight tonight the head will be destroyed and a new era will begin
you must now decide if you are going to be a part of that era
everywhere terrified soldiers listen to the voice
you can choose to stay here and die with your leader or you can choose to be free
the decision is yours and yours alone
captain order all your men to fall back and secure this position
some of you have wives
some of you have families
all of you have lives
consider each of them as you ask yourself are they a part of the past or are they a part of the future
fall back and secure the central platform
deep in the tunnel two soldiers look at each other
simultaneously they drop their guns and run
any man that disobeys this order will be court marshaled
groups of solders drop their weapons and disappear into the shadows
captain where are your men
the station fills with the sound of boots running wildly away
goddammit i will not tolerate this insubordination
i want those deserters shot captain
finch slowly draws back away from the leader
shot on sight
the few men on the platform are soon the only men left
were getting out of here
a knife sings through the air and buries itself in the captains chest
with a tiny rasp he falls to the ground
the remaining men bolt
he grabs for the captains machine gun
i know who you are
ill see you hang
every last one of you
you echoes down the dark empty throat of the tunnel
the leader looks around his flashlight sweeping in big arcs as he realizes that he is alone
finch goddammit you cant leave me
dont leave me
you are going to die as you ruled the leader screams whipping around towards the voice
the smile is as cold and as sharp as the knife that flicks from his hand
the leader raises his gun just when the knife sinks into his shoulder
howling in pain he drops the gun
v smiles into the spot of his flashlight
is that you
youre working with finch arent you
youre all in this together
v closes in
who are you
you most of all should know leader
you created me
without you i would never be
more than life leader you gave me purpose
v draws his final blade
he that killeth with the sword shall be killed with the sword
v raises the knife
v and the leader turn to find finch aiming a machine gun at mr
oh god mr
drop the knife
v does and susan begins an almost hysterical laugh
oh i knew it mr
i knew you wouldnt desert me
youre a good man finch
a damn good man
no im not
im a man who does his job and does what hes told
for twenty seven years thats all ive been
he steps toward v staring into his smiling black eyes
hes quick as the devil
finch ignores the leader
ive read delias diary over and over all year
it sickens me but i am unable to judge her
i am as guilty as she
finch what are you doing
kill the bastard finch
i have no excuse
i did what i was told to do
finch i order you to shoot him
my job was to find you and catch you
ive done my job
ive done it for the last time
im tired of it
im tired of it all
he tosses the gun to the leader
kill him yourself if you can
the leader seethes his eyes boring into finch
thank you v
the machine gun burst shatters the quiet concrete silence
finch falls dead at vs feet
i warned you finch the penalty for treason is death
he aims the gun at v
are you ready to die
the real question is are you
the leader laughs
do you really believe you can pick up that knife before i pull this trigger
but i dont have to
almost casually v bends down to pick up the knife the leader screams and fires
bullets knock v back a bit but he continues grabbing the knife and standing
eyes widening with disbelief the leader fires another blast as v begins walking towards him
the machine gun roars bullets shredding out through the back of vs cloak as he continues with short deliberate steps until the hammer clicks against the pin
the gun is empty
v stands before him
you cannot kill me
there is no flesh and blood within this cloak to kill
there is only an idea
and ideas are bulletproof
the leader screams
v drives the knife into his heart killing him instantly
v stands alone amidst the carnage and seeping pools of red
his body wavers
he takes his hands out from beneath his cloak and reveals his gloves wet with blood
the front door opens and helen enters
creedy you dumb bastard you left your car parked in front
she walks up the stairs to the bedroom
what did i tell you
she steps into the room her sole and heel sinking into the plush carpet soaked with blood
oh my god
when she sees creedys head mashed open she covers her mouth
conrad has propped himself against the bed
what have you done
i won helen
i did it
im the better man
he crawls toward her slipping on the wet carpet
weve been through a bad patch helen
but now hes gone
theres nothing to come between us
he reaches for her foot his hand gloved with wet red
dont touch me
you stupid piece of shit
youve ruined it
i had it all planned perfectly and youve ruined it
she checks her watch two hours to midnight
i have to get out of here
i have to get away
conrad seizes hold of her ankle
the look in his eyes frightens her
she tries to kick free of him but he wont let go
twisting she reaches for the door but slips on the carpet
conrad damn you
let me go
no helen youre not leaving me
not this time
he crawls up her body still clutching the bloody knife
oh god no
oh god please help me
conrad raises the knife
no one can help us helen
god is dead
the knife falls
evey hears v on the spiral staircase
scarlet footprints trail behind v as he struggles down the stairs
you came back
he nods and then collapses rolling down the rest of the stairs
running to him she falls to his side
his clothes are slick with blood
oh god what happened
you need a doctor
its too late for that
no dont say that
evey listen to me
ive not long and there are things that must be said
his voice strains beneath the mask
i have done that which i came to do
now it is time for me to rest and with me the past will at last find peace
trembling evey holds him
but the world the world is not saved
do not think that when the fires die and the smoke clears there is no miracle
there is only a path
upon which they must learn to rule themselves
yes they need you v
not me evey not me
i told you i am the villain
but yes they will need help
he reaches up and wipes a tear from her cheek
i kept my promise to you evey
now you must promise me
you will discover the face under this mask
but you will never look beneath it
i dont understand
wherever i shall go i shall always love you
v you are not going anywhere
make them remember
youre not going to die v
let me be there evey when it begins
please let me hear the music one last time
i wont let you die
i know you wont
ave atque vale
holding him as tight as she can she feels his life drain away slipping through her arms in the way the last grains of sand pour through the neck of
she buries her face beside his and weeps
an enormous crowd has begun to gather in the streets surrounding the new government building
with the crowd a restlessness swells against each barricade erected by the military
a sergeant stands on an armored car speaking through a megaphone
return to your homes
there is nothing to see
the terrorist is dead
he aint dead
hell be here just like he said
evey huddles against the stair railing her face tear stained staring at the lifeless body of v
i remember staring at the mask at that smile
she touches the mask her fingers finding its edge
part of me couldnt believe he was dead and maybe that was why
the smile was still the same
it made me want to tear it off so i could see the face so i could see that he was dead
her fingers stop
but i had promised
you will discover the face under this mask but you will never look beneath it
i began to try to imagine his face
of course i had long pictured my father behind that smile but i knew in my heart that v was not my father
evey stares into the eyes the dark empty eyes
yet every time i pictured another face any face something was lost something important was somehow diminished
v was more than a face
v was v
her expression changes
and then quite suddenly quite naturally i realized whose face must be beneath that mask
it was the only face that mattered
i wont let you die
i know you wont
a small smile creeps across her face
midnight approaches and the crowd feels it
spilling everywhere they fill the streets like a flood
evey sets a final violet carson on the chest of v
he is lying on a bed made of gelignite covered in roses
touching his mask she bends over him
goodbye my love
tenderly she presses her lips to the smile her eyes closing her final tears blinking free
she backs away and v smiles his lips wet with her kiss his cheek wet with her tears
ave atque vale
on the train platform evey reaches through the window and starts the train
i looked it up the next morning
the wheels churn as the train lurches forward
hail and farewell
make them remember
she watches the train disappear into the tunnel
they will my love
the crowd surges against a barricade when a voice cries out across the city echoing through the megaphone on every corner
remember remember the fifth of november
high above the gathered mass a masked figure steps out onto a roof parapet
the crowd explodes
the train barrels along screaming against its rusted rails
dressed as v evey stands on the roofs edge speaking into a microphone
i have come here tonight to keep a promise
a promise that is over four hundred years old
tonight i am here to give you your freedom
again the crowd bursts into a frenzy
since mankinds dawn a handful of oppressors have accepted the responsibility over our lives responsibility that we should have accepted ourselves
by doing so they took our power
by doing nothing we gave it away
the voice booms over the mesmerized crowd
tonight our world will change
our leaders will be gone and we must choose what comes next
a return to the chains of others or lives of our own
a world of the past or one of the future
she feels the sea of humanity beneath her almost channeling their energy
let us choose carefully london and when we do let us mark well and remember remember this fifth of november
the crowd screams as one and their scream becomes the train hurling like a bullet through a gun barrel
ahead the tracks end buried beneath the rubble of the collapsed tunnel
inside the rattling train v lays in perfect repose
let me be there evey when it begins
hidden and alone evey pulls the mask from her face
please let me hear the music
one last time
almost unconsciously evey raises her hand and coaxes the first soft notes as he had once done
at first you have to listen carefully
the violins of the overture steadily rise
there it is
beautiful is it not
evey smiles her hand still gently conducting
yes my love
yes it is
with the clash of cymbals the train crashes into the wall of rubble
the entire building opens like a time lapsed rose blooming with brilliant orange petals of flame
the crowd is awash in the baptismal glow of erupting flame
evey watches the explosion a star burst of flaming debris searing against the night sky like fireworks
the masses burst through the barricades with a euphoric frenzy
the explosion begins to slowly die
i know that there is only one way to repay him for what he did
she looks down at the mask
and i know that that way is going to take a lot of hard work
i know this like i know the sun will rise tomorrow and beneath that new sun our work will begin
the fire fades and evey turns cradling the mask and walks away
