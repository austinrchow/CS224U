adaptation by joel and ethan coen based on the novel by charles portis june white letters on a black screen the wicked flee when none pursueth
the quotation fades
a womans voice voice over people do not give it credence that a young girl could leave home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her fathers blood but
it did happen
the street of a western town night
the street is deserted
we track slowly forward
i was just fourteen years of age when a coward by the name of tom chaney shot my father down in fort smith arkansas and robbed him of his life
and his horse and two california gold pieces that he carried in his trouser band
a shape lies in the street below the busted out porch railing of a two story building
a sign identifies the building as the monarch boarding house
papa was a cumberland presbyterian and a mason
hed hired chaney for paid wages not on shares when chaney was down on his luck
if papa had a failing it was his kindly disposition i did not get my mean streak from him
the crumpled shape is a body
we hear the thunder of approaching hooves
he had taken chaney up to fort smith to help lead back a string of mustang ponies hed just bought from a stock trader named stonehill
in town chaney had fallen to drink and cards and lost all his money
he got it into his head hed been cheated and went back to the boarding house for his henry rifle
papa remonstrated and chaney shot him in the breast
a galloping horse enters frame and recedes whipped on by a bareback rider
a long barreled rifle is tied across the riders back with a sash cord
he disappears into the falling snow
he could have taken the time to saddle the horse or hitched up three spans of mules to a concord stagecoach and smoked a pipe as it seems that no
one in that city was inclined to give chase
chaney had mistaken its citizens for men
we are looking into the window of a moving train
looking out past us is a fourteen year old girl mattie ross
next to her is yarnell a middle aged black man
reading backward in the mirror of the window we see a station sign easing in as the train slows fort smith
the voice over continues voice over you might say what business was it of my fathers to meddle
my answer is this he was trying to do that short devil a good turn
he was his brothers keeper
does that answer your question
candlelight flickers over the mans waxy features
voice irish accented is that the man
the body wrapped in a shroud lies in a pine coffin
mattie and yarnell stand looking down at it
an undertaker grizzled and severely dressed holds the candle
yarnell lord lord
mattie that is my father
undertaker if you would loik to kiss him it would be all roight
yarnell he has gone home
praise the lord
mattie put the lid on
why is it so much
undertaker the quality of the casket and of the embalming
the loifloik appearance requires time and art
and the chemicals come dear
the particulars are in your bill
if you would loik to kiss him it would be all roight
the spirit has flown
your wire said fifty dollars
undertaker you did not specify he was to be shipped
mattie well sixty dollars is every cent we have
it leaves nothing for our board
yarnell you can see to the bodys transport to the train station and accompany it home and i will have to sleep here tonight
yarnell i dont think your mamad want you to stay in this town by yourself
mattie it cant be helped
i still have to collect fathers things and see to some other business
yarnell but is your chap a rone
your mama didnt say for you to see to no business here
mattie it is business mama doesnt know about
its all right yarnell i dismiss you
yarnell well im not sure i mattie tell mama not to sign anything until i return home and see that papa is buried in his masons apron
to the undertaker your terms are agreeable if i may pass the night here
among these people
mattie looks around the empty room
mattie these people
undertaker i am expecting three more souls
sullivan smith and his tongue in the rain
mattie how is it that you know in advance
three men stand upon a rough hewn three banger gallows
the condemned are two white men and an indian
they wear new jeans and flannel shirts buttoned to the neck
each has a noose around his neck
one of the white men is addressing the crowd man ladies and gentlemen beware and train up your children in the way that they should go
you see what has become of me because of drink
i killed a man in a trifling quarrel over a pocketknife
mattie is pushing her way through the spectators thronging the town square
up on the gallows the condemned speaker starts to weep
man if i had received good instruction as a child i would be with my wife and children today away out on the cimarron river
i dont know what is to become of them
i hope and pray that you will not slight them and compel them to go into low company
his blubbering will not let him go on
he steps back
a man standing by slips a black hood over his head which continues to bob with sobbing
mattie hisses to a woman nearby mattie can you point out the sheriff
the woman indicates a figure among the officiators on the scaffold woman him with the mustaches
the second condemned man is speaking man well i killed the wrong man is the which of why im here
had i killed the man i meant to i dont believe i would a been convicted
i see men out there in that crowd is worse than me
a thinking pause
he nods shrugging
he steps back and is hooded
the third man steps forward
indian i would like to say he is hooded speech cut short
the hangman hand to his elbow helps him step back
the executioner pulls a lever on the scaffold
three trapdoors swing open and three men drop
they hit the end of their ropes with a crack
two of the men have their heads snapped to an angle and are limp and twist slowly
one though writhes and kicks jackknifing his legs
man oh sullivan muster lost weight in prison
his neck aint broke
sullivan continues to writhe and kick
voice hot tamales
mattie looks down at a boy selling hot tamales out of a bucket
mattie is talking to the sheriff whom we saw officiating on the scaffold
the square is emptying and in the background all three men twist slowly the last man having finally given up the ghost
the mexican boy still hawks tamales to stragglers
sheriff no we aint arrested him
aint caught up to him he lit out for the territory
i would think he has throwed in with lucky ned pepper whose gang robbed a mail hack yesterday on the poteau river
mattie why are you not looking for him
sheriff i have no authority in the indian nation
tom chaney is the business of the u
mattie when will they arrest him
sheriff not soon i am afraid
the marshals are not well staffed and i will tell you frankly chaney is at the end of a long list of fugitives and malefactors
mattie could i hire a marshal to pursue tom chaney
the sheriff looks at the girl and chuckles
sheriff you have a lot of experience with bounty hunters
mattie my answer is this that is a silly question
i am here to settle my fathers affairs
sheriff all alone
mattie i am the person for it
mama was never any good at sums and she can hardly spell cat
i intend to see papas killer hanged
sheriff i see
nothing prevents you from offering a reward or from so informing a marshal
it would have to be real money though to be persuasive
chaney is across the river in the choctaw nation lawless country
it will not be a daisy picking expedition
upwards of three score us marshals have been slaughtered in the territory
mattie i will see to the money
whos the best marshal
sheriff i would have to weigh that proposition
i reckon william waters is the best tracker
he is half comanche and it is something to see him cut for sign
the meanest one is rooster cogburn
he is a pitiless man double tough and fear dont enter into his thinking
he loves to pull a cork
the best is probably l
quinn he brings his prisoners in alive
he may let one get by now and again but he believes even the worst of men is entitled to a fair shake
quinn is a good peace officer and a lay preacher to boot
he will not plant evidence or abuse a prisoner
he is as straight as string
yes i will say quinn is about the best they have
mattie where can i find this rooster
rapping at a door of rough plank
after a beat a voice rasping and slurred voice the jakes is occupied
we see that mattie stands before an outhouse
mattie i know it is occupied mr
as i said i have business with you
voice i have prior business
mattie you have been at it for quite some time mr
voice roaring drunk there is no clock on my business
to hell with you
to hell with you
how did you stalk me here
mattie the sheriff told me to look in the saloon
in the saloon they referred me here
we must talk
voice outraged women aint allowed in the saloon
mattie i was not there as a customer
i am fourteen years old
mattie reaches up and raps again vigorously
voice sullen the jakes is occupied
and will be for some time
a coffin is dropped heavily into frame and we see chalked onto the freshly milled wood of its top ross yell county hold at station after a resting beat during
which the coffins handlers presumably adjust their grip the coffin is shoved away over the straw littered planking of a rail freight car
once it has been pushed fully in the upright planking of the boxcar door blurs through frame in the extreme foreground til the door slams to rest
we hear the steam engine start to chug and the foreground door moves slowly off with the grinding motion of the train
it is the barnlike door to the morticians workroom the irish undertaker holds it open for mattie
she carries a bedroll
undertaker you can sleep in a coffin if you loik
three bodies lay under shrouds on a high work table
the arm of the nearest sticks out rope burns on its wrist
three coffins are in various stages of assembly
mattie unwinds the bedroll onto the floor
mattie strides along looking at facades
she stops looking at the signage on a barnlike building col
mattie steps to the doorway of an office set in a corner of the stable
mattie how much are you paying for cotton
stonehill looks up from his desk
he eyes the girl up and down
stonehill nine and a half for low middling and ten for ordinary
mattie we got most of ours out early and sold it to woodson brothers in little rock for eleven cents
stonehill then i suggest you take the balance of it to the woodson brothers
mattie we took the balance to woodson
we got ten and a half
stonehill why did you come here to tell me this
mattie i thought we might shop around up here next year but i guess we are doing all right in little rock
i am mattie ross daughter of frank ross
stonehill sets his pen down and leans back
stonehill a tragic thing
may i say your father impressed me with his manly qualities
he was a close trader but he acted the gentleman
mattie i propose to sell those ponies back to you that my father bought
stonehill that i fear is out of the question
i will see that they are shipped to you at my earliest convenience
mattie we dont want the ponies now
we dont need them
stonehill well that hardly concerns me
your father bought those five ponies and paid for them and there is an end of it
i have the bill of sale
mattie and i want three hundred dollars for papas saddle horse that was stolen from your stable
stonehill you will have to take that up with the man who stole the horse
mattie tom chaney stole the horse while it was in your care
you are responsible
stonehill i admire your sand but i believe you will find that i am not liable for such claims
mattie you were custodian
if you were a bank and were robbed you could not simply tell the depositors to go hang
stonehill i do not entertain hypotheticals the world as it is is vexing enough
secondly your valuation of the horse is high by about two hundred dollars
how old are you
mattie if anything my price is low
judy is a fine racing mare
she has won purses of twenty five dollars i have seen her jump an eight rail fence with a heavy rider
i am fourteen
well thats all very interesting
the ponies are yours take them
your fathers horse was stolen by a murderous criminal
i had provided reasonable protection for the creature as per our implicit agreement
my watchman had his teeth knocked out and can take only soup
we must each bear his own misfortunes
mattie i will take it to law
stonehill you have no case
mattie lawyer j
noble daggett of dardanelle arkansas may think otherwise as might a jury petitioned by a widow and three small children
stonehill where is your mother
mattie she is at home in yell county looking after my sister victoria and my brother little frank
stonehill i cannot make an agreement with a minor child
you are not accountable
mattie lawyer dagget will back up any decision i make you may rest easy on that score
you can confirm any agreement by telegraph
stonehill i will pay two hundred dollars to your fathers estate when i have in my hand a letter from your lawyer absolving me of all liability from the beginning
of the world to date
the offer is more than liberal and i make it only to avoid the possibility of troublesome litigation
mattie i will take two hundred dollars for judy plus one hundred for the ponies and twenty five dollars for the gray horse that tom chaney left
he is easily worth forty
that is three hundred twenty five dollars total
stonehill the ponies have no part of this
i will not buy them
mattie then the price for judy is three hundred twenty five dollars
stonehill i would not pay three hundred and twenty five dollars for winged pegasus
as for the gray horse it does not belong to you
and you are a snip
mattie the gray was lent to tom chaney by my father
chaney only had the use of him
your other points are beneath comment
stonehill i will pay two hundred and twenty five dollars and keep the gray horse
i dont want the ponies
mattie i cannot accept that
she stands there can be no settlement after i leave this office
it will go to law
stonehill this is my last offer
two hundred and fifty dollars
for that i get the release previously discussed and i keep your fathers saddle
i am also writing off a feed and stabling charge
the gray horse is not yours to sell
you are an unnatural child
mattie the saddle is not for sale
i will keep it
lawyer dagget can prove ownership of the gray horse
he will come after you with a writ of replevin
stonehill a what
all right now listen very carefully as i will not bargain further
i will take the ponies back and keep the gray horse which is mine and settle for three hundred dollars
now you must take that or leave it and i do not much care which it is
mattie lawyer daggett would not wish me to consider anything under three hundred twenty five dollars
but i will settle for three hundred and twenty if i am given the twenty in advance
and here is what i have to say about the saddle we are tracking down the street we toward the monarch boarding house
mattie is humping a saddle up the street
she stops before the boarding house
she looks at its sign
she looks at its busted out porch railing
a marjorie main like woman crushes mattie to her bosom
floyd frank rosss daughter
my poor child
my poor child
mattie grimaces arms pinned to her sides
mattie you have my fathers traps
floyd oh yes we do
my poor child
are you gawna be stayin with us or are you hurrying home to your mother
mattie i am staying briefly
i have business with marshal rooster cogburn
i found him in his cups today but i understand hes to be in court tomorrow testifying
i mean to engage him to hunt down tom chaney
floyd well god bless him for that
the tariff here is seventy five cents for room and supper
that does not include your daytime eats
mattie very well
floyd your father owed for two days god bless him
floyd youll share a room with grandma turner
weve had to double up what with all the people in town come to see the hanging judge parkers put on for us
mattie yes i witnessed the hanging myself
floyd was it a goodn
a blanket is unrolled to reveal a watch a cheap knife and a long barreled colts dragoon revolver
voice off mrs
floyd this was in the poor mans room
this is everything there are no light fingers in this house
if you need something for to tote the gun around i will give you an empty flour sack for a nickel
we hear wind whistling through cracks in the floorboards and walls
we hear snoring
there is one bed not large with two shapes in it
we cut in closer to find mattie lying on her back staring
she shivers shoulders hunched
the thin blanket barely covers her
she pulls the blanket gently slowly so that it covers her exposed side
a beat of snoring a snorfle and then as we hold on mattie the crackle of mattress ticking under a shifting body and the blanket is pulled away toward the
voices echo from inside the courtroom
mattie cracks a heavy oak door and slips in
the gallery is crowded
mattie is at the back of a press of standees
her point of view semi obstructed on the witness stand is rooster cogburn a rough hewn man going to middle aged fat
he has a patch over one eye
cogburn the woman was out in the yard dead with blowflies on her face and the old man was inside with his breast blowed open by a scatter gun and
his feet burned
he was still alive but just was
he said them two wharton boys had done it rode up drunk mr
barlow dying declaration your honor
cogburn them two wharton boys thatd be odus and c
throwed down on him asked him where his money was when he wouldnt talk lit pine knots and held em to his feet
he told em in a fruit jar under a gray rock at one corner of the smokehouse
barlow and then
cogburn well he died on us
passed away in considerable pain
barlow what did you do then
cogburn me and marshal potter went out to the smokehouse and that rock had been moved and that jar was gone
barlow you found a flat gray rock at the corner of the smokehouse with a hollowed out space under it
goudy if the prosecutor is going to give evidence i suggest that he be sworn
barlow marshal cogburn what did you find if anything at the corner of the smokehouse
cogburn we found a flat gray rock with a hollowed out space under it
barlow and what did cogburn no jar or nothin
barlow what did you do then
cogburn well we rode up to the whartons near where the north fork strikes the canadian branch of the canadian
barlow and what did you find
cogburn i had my glass and we spotted the two boys and their old daddy aaron wharton down there on the creek bank with some hogs
theyd killed a shoat and was butchering it
theyd built a fire under a wash pot for scalding water
barlow what did you do
cogburn crept down
i announced that we was u
marshals and hollered to aaron that we needed to talk to his boys
he picked up a axe and commenced to cussing us and blackguarding this court
barlow what did you do then
cogburn backed away trying to talk some sense into him
edges over by the wash pot and picks up a shotgun
potter seen him but it was too late
wharton pulled down on potter with one barrel and then turned to do the same for me with the other
i shot him and when the old man swung the axe i shot him
odus lit out and i shot him
aaron wharton and c
wharton was dead when they hit the ground but odus was just winged
barlow did you find the jar with the hundred and twenty dollars in it
barlow what happened then
cogburn i found the jar with a hundred and twenty dollars in it
barlow and what happened to marshal potter
leaves a wife and six babies
judge strike the comment
barlow and what became of odus wharton
cogburn there he sets
you may ask mr
goudy thank you mr
in your four years as u
cogburn how many men have you shot
goudy there is more to this shooting than meets the eye judge parker
i will establish the bias of this witness
judge objection is overruled
goudy how many mr
cogburn i never shot nobody i didnt have to
goudy that was not the question
cogburn shot or killed
goudy let us restrict it to killed so that we may have a manageable figure
cogburn around twelve or fifteen
stopping men in flight defending myself et cetera
goudy around twelve or fifteen
so many that you cannot keep a precise count
remember you are under oath
i have examined the records and can supply the accurate figure
cogburn i believe them two whartons make twenty three
goudy twenty three dead men in four years
cogburn it is a dangerous business
goudy how many members of this one family the wharton family have you killed
cogburn immediate or mr
barlow your honor perhaps counsel should be advised that the marshal is not the defendant in this action
barlow the history is relevant your honor
goes to cogburns methods and animosities
barlow did you also shoot dub wharton brother and clete wharton half brother
cogburn clete was selling ardent spirits to the cherokee
he come at me with a king bolt
goudy you were armed and he advanced upon you with nothing but a king bolt
from a wagon tongue
cogburn ive seen men badly tore up with things no bigger than a king bolt
i defended myself
goudy and returning to the encounter with aaron and his two remaining sons you sprang from cover with your revolver in hand
cogburn i did
goudy loaded and cocked
cogburn if it aint loaded and cocked it dont shoot
goudy and like his son aaron wharton advanced against an armed man
cogburn he was armed
he had that axe raised
i believe you testified that you backed away from aaron wharton
cogburn that is right
goudy which direction were you going
cogburn i always go backwards when im backing up
goudy very amusing i suppose for all of us except aaron wharton
now he advanced upon you much in the manner of clete wharton menacing you with that king bolt or rolled up newspaper or whatever it was
cogburn yes sir
he commenced to cussing and laying about with threats
goudy and you were backing away
how many steps before the shooting started
cogburn seven eight steps
goudy aaron wharton keeping pace advancing away from the fire seven eight steps what would that be fifteen twenty feet
cogburn i suppose
goudy will you explain to the jury mr
cogburn why mr
wharton was found immediately by the wash pot with one arm in the fire his sleeve and hand smoldering
goudy did you move the body after you shot him
cogburn why would i do that
goudy you did not drag his body over to the fire
fling his arm in
cogburn no sir
goudy two witnesses who arrived on the scene will testify to the location of the body
you do not remember moving the body
so it was a bushwack as he tended his campfire
cogburn i if that was where the body was i might have moved him
i do not remember
goudy why would you move the body mr
cogburn them hogs rooting around might have moved him
i do not remember
mattie waits as people file out
she pushes forward to meet cogburn when he emerges muttering
cogburn son of a goddamn bitch
mattie rooster cogburn
cogburn what is it
he does not look up from the cigarette he is trying to roll
his hands are shaking
mattie i would like to talk with you a minute
cogburn what is it
mattie they tell me you are a man with true grit
cogburn what do you want girl
it is suppertime
mattie let me do that
she takes the fixings and rolls licks and twists the cigarette
your makings are too dry
i am looking for the man who shot and killed my father frank ross in front of the monarch boarding house
the mans name is tom chaney
they say he is over in indian territory and i need somebody to go after him
cogburn what is your name girl
mattie my name is mattie ross
we are located in yell county
my mother is at home looking after my sister victoria and my brother little frank
cogburn you had best go home to them
they will need help with the churning
mattie there is a fugitive warrant out for chaney
the government will pay you two dollars for bringing him in plus ten cents a mile for each of you
on top of that i will pay you a fifty dollar reward
cogburn gazes at her
cogburn what are you
looks at the flour sack she holds whatve you got there in your poke
she opens it
a colts dragoon
why youre no bigger than a corn nubbin whatre you doing with a pistol like that
mattie i intend to kill tom chaney with it if the law fails to do so
cogburn well that piece will do the job if you can find a high stump to rest it on and a wall to put behind you
mattie nobody here knew my father and i am afraid nothing much is going to be done about chaney except i do it
my brother is a child and my mother is indecisive and hobbled by grief
cogburn i dont believe you have fifty dollars
mattie i will shortly
i have a contract with colonel stonehill which he will make payment on tomorrow or the next day once a lawyer countersigns
cogburn i dont believe fairy tales or sermons or stories about money baby sister
but thank you for the cigarette
mattie climbs the few steps from the street
her attention is drawn by a man sitting on a chair to one side enjoying the quiet of the evening
he is dressed for riding with perhaps a bit too much panache
it is almost dark and he is hard to see but it seems he is watching mattie amused
he raises a pipe to his mouth and pulls at it
the glow from the excited bowl kicks on his eyes which are indeed tracking her
mattie discomfited by his look turns hastily forward and pushes open the door
a jingling sound prompts one more glance to the side
the mans face is now hidden by his hat
just before matties point of view now a lateral track starts to lose him behind the door jamb he raises a spurred boot to push against the porch rail and
tip his chair back
he raises his other foot spur jingling and drapes it over the first
we are pushing in on the landlady
landlady isnt your mother expecting you home dear
i did not think to see you this evening
mattie my business is not yet finished
floyd have any rooms opened up
the bed is quite narrow
landlady the second floor back did open up but the gentleman on the porch has just taken it
but dont worry yourself dear you are not disturbing grandma turner
as before unseen grandma turner snores loudly as wind whistles and mattie shivers
fade to black
in the quiet a faint crickle crackle of flame
it is followed by a lip pop and a deep inhale
mattie opens her eyes
she is beaded with sweat
she looks blearily up
the room is dim
a man sits facing her in a straghtback chair faintly backlit by the daylight leaking through the curtained window behind him
he exhales pipesmoke
cowboy you are sleeping the day away
mattie i am not well
the man rises and spurs jingling crosses to the window and throws open the curtain
mattie squints at him against the daylight the man has a cowlick and barndoor ears and is once again well accoutered for riding
he steps away from the window and reseats himself
cowboy you do not look well
my name is leboeuf
i have just come from yell county
mattie we have no rodeo clowns in yell county
leboeuf a saucy line will not get you far with me
i saw your mother yesterday morning
she says for you to come right on home
what was your business there
leboeuf takes a small photograph from his coat
leboeuf this is a man i think you know
mattie looks at the picture through red rimmed eyes
you called him tom chaney i believe
mattie declines to contradict
leboeuf continues though in the months i have been tracking him he has used the names theron chelmsford john todd andersen and others
he dallied in monroe louisiana and pine bluff arkansas before turning up at your fathers place
mattie why did you not catch him in monroe louisiana or pine bluff arkansas
leboeuf he is a crafty one
mattie i thought him slow witted myself
leboeuf that was his act
mattie it was a good one
are you some kind of law
leboeuf tips back in his chair and draws back his coat to display a star
a smug look
leboeuf thats right
i am a texas ranger
mattie that may make you a big noise in that state in arkansas you should mind that your texas trappings and title do not make you an object of fun
why have you been ineffectually pursuing chaney
leboeufs smile stays in place with effort
leboeuf he shot and killed a state senator named bibbs down in waco texas
the bibbs family have put out a reward
mattie how came chaney to shoot a state senator
leboeuf my understanding is there was an argument about a dog
do you know anything about where chaney has gone
mattie he is in the territory and i hold out little hope for you earning your bounty
leboeuf why is that
mattie my man will beat you to it
i have hired a deputy marshal the toughest one they have and he is familiar with the lucky ned pepper gang that they say chaney has tied up with
leboeuf well i will throw in with you and your marshal
marshal cogburn and i are fine
leboeuf itll be to our mutual advantage
your marshal i presume knows the territory i know chaney
it is at least a two man job taking him alive
mattie when chaney is taken he is coming back to fort smith to hang
i am not having him go to texas to hang for shooting some senator
leboeuf haw haw
it is not important where he hangs is it
mattie it is to me
is it to you
leboeuf it means a great deal of money to me
its been many months work
mattie im sorry that you are paid piecework not on wages and that you have been eluded the winter long by a halfwit
marshal cogburn and i are fine
leboeuf you give out very little sugar with your pronouncements
while i sat there watching you i gave some thought to stealing a kiss though you are very young and sick and unattractive to boot but now i have a
mind to give you five or six good licks with my belt
mattie rolls away onto her side
mattie one would be as unpleasant as the other
if you wet your comb it might tame that cowlick
her eyelids droop
spurs jingle and fade away
distant voices from the street
clanging church bell
very close the clink of bottle against cup
mattie looks blearily over
the room is now filled with long shadows
the landlady has materialized at the side of the bed
she is pouring something from a bottle into a ceramic cup
landlady try some dr
you may feel giddy but do not be alarmed as that is only the medicine working
mattie obediently rises to an elbow drinks then drops back onto the pillow
a clunk the landlady has set the bottle down on the nightstand
mattie squints at the bottle dr
underwoods bile activator approved by physicians and clergymen the rooms shadows grow longer still and crawl up the bottle
the voice of the unseen landlady echoes and trails away landlady i will charge you ten cents
it probably means a loss for me but it is hard to figure the exact proportion of the bottle
from outside the sound of a horse approaching at a gallop
we cut outside
it is snowing and night again
frank rosss body is once again in the street before the boarding house
the bareback horseman enters frame and recedes rifle tied to his back
a saddled horse stands in the middle of the street pointed at the receding tom chaney
chaney disappears down the dark street into the falling snow
small hands reach up and wrap the saddlehorn on the waiting horse
matties face appears over the saddle as she tries to pull herself up
close on her feet rising from the ground then pedaling seeking purchase
there are no stirrups
close on mattie again
sweating she succeeds in chinning and elbowing herself onto the horses back
the sound of the fleeing horseman has receded almost to nothing
she gets herself arranged in the saddle
she looks down for the reins
the reins hang down from the bit
she lies forward onto the horses neck a fistful of mane in one hand reaching with the other
her fingers curl around the reins
the horse tosses its head and rears
matties legs squeeze the horses flanks
her fingers tighten on the horses mane but she is slipping falling
in the boarding house bedroom matties hands clutch at pillow
it is dark
a phlegm hawking sound
a woman in a nightgown face obscured by sleeping bonnet approaches the bed and disappears around its far side
the sound of the old woman climbing into bed and settling
after a beat the covers are yanked from mattie
after another beat snoring
the door bangs open at the cut and mattie emerges with an envelope
it is day
mattie walks down the street holding the ripped open envelope in one hand and some unfolded papers in the other the topmost of which she reads as she walks
we hear the letters contents in a gruff male voice over letter mattie
i wish you would leave these matters entirely to me or at the very least do me the courtesy of consulting me before entering such agreements
i am not scolding you but i am saying your headstrong ways will lead you into a tight corner one day
i trust the enclosed document will let you conclude your business and return to dardanelle
your mother is in a panic and begging me to fetch you back home
thrust onto a desk
wider shows that we are once again in the office of stonehill the stock trader
he examines the release through bleary eyes displaying none of his former vinegar
mattie i was as bad yesterday as you look today
i was forced to share a bed with grandma turner
the traders eyes are still on the paper stonehill i am not acquainted with grandma turner
if she is a resident of this city it does not surprise me that she carries disease
i was told this malarial place was to be the chicago of the southwest
well my little friend it is not the chicago of the southwest
i cannot rightly say what it is but it has ruined my health as it has my finances
he drops the paper
i owe you money
he works a key in a drawer and takes out money and counts during the following
mattie you have not traded poorly
stonehill certainly not
i am paying you for a horse i do not possess and have bought back a string of useless ponies i cannot sell again
mattie you are forgetting the gray horse
mattie you are looking at the thing in the wrong light
stonehill i am looking at it in the light of gods eternal truth
he hands the money across and mattie counts to confirm
mattie your illness is putting you down in the dumps
you will soon find a buyer for the ponies
stonehill i have a tentative offer of ten dollars per head from the pfitzer soap works of little rock
mattie it would be a shame to destroy such spirited horseflesh
stonehill so it would
i am confident the deal will fall through
mattie look here
i need a pony
i will pay ten dollars for one of them
that was lot price
wait a minute
are we trading again
i just handed you twenty dollars each for those ponies and you now propose to buy one back for ten
little girl i will give you ten dollars to refrain from doing any more business here
it would be the most astute deal i have struck in arkansas
we are tracking along a line of stalls toward a small corral holding a black mustang among other ponies
mattie is approaching the horse
a black stablehand has been trailing her humping her fathers saddle
mattie this one is beautiful
she rubs the muzzle of the black horse
she takes the saddle from the stablehand and tries to throw it over the horse
she is not tall or strong enough
the stableboy helps then helps her up
the horse does not move for a long beat
the stableboy is laughing
stableboy he dont know theys a person up there
you too light
she kicks lightly and the horse abruptly pitches once or twice and then starts prancing
the stableboy still laughing stands in the middle of a circle defined by the prancing horse
stableboy he thinks he got a horsefly on him
mattie leans forward to calm the horse rubbing the muzzle and shushing him
mattie he is very spirited
i will call him little blackie
stableboy das a good name
mattie what does he like for a treat
stableboy maam he is a horse so he likes apples
she reins the horse around and heads for the door calling back mattie thank mr
stonehill for me
the receding stableboy is uncomfortable
stableboy no maam
i aint sposed to utter your name
whipped up at the cut
peering in is mattie holding the makeshift curtain open is an elderly chinese
behind them we can see the shelves of a modest grocery store and in the deep background its bright street facing window
reverse a squalid living area crowded with effects
it is dim
there is snoring
rooster cogburn is in a chinese rope bed his weight bowing it almost to the ground
mattie steps in
mattie that is fine
i will wake him
chinese wont like
mattie ignores him poking at rooster as the grocer withdraws letting the canvas drop behind him
cogburn it is i
mattie ross your employer
mattie how long til you are ready to go
rooster opens his eyes blinks
rooster go whar
mattie into the indian territory
in pursuit of tom chaney
he focuses on mattie swings his legs out rumbles and spits on the floor
he reaches over a pouch of tobacco and begins fumbling with cigarette makings
you are the bereaved girl with stories of el dorado
why are you admitting callers
a voice from the front of the store grocer toad her no good
mattie takes out some cash
mattie i said fifty dollars to retrieve chaney
you did not believe me
rooster is sobered by the sight of the currency
rooster well i did not know
you are a hard one to figure
mattie how long for you to make ready to depart
mattie takes the cigarette fixings at which rooster is fumbling and works on a cigarette
rooster well now wait now sis
i remember your offer but do not remember agreeing to it
if im going up against ned pepper i will need a hundred dollars
i can tell you that much
i am not pursuing his gang through arkansas where there is law and the criminal is out of his element
they are in the territory in their element where there is no law and the marshal stands alone
he spits again
hundred dollars is the right amount
i will take those fifty dollars in advance
there will be expenses
mattie you are trying to take advantage of me
rooster i am giving you the childrens rate
i am not a sharper i am an old man sleeping in a rope bed in a room behind a chinese grocery
i should burn this damn thing
it is no good for my back sister
i have nothing
she hands him the finished cigarette
mattie you want to be kept in whiskey
rooster is patting at his chest
rooster i dont have to buy that i confiscate it
i am an officer of the court
she lights his cigarette
that is the rate
mattie i shall not niggle
can we depart this afternoon
the word detonates a fit of coughing
you are not going
that is no part of it
mattie you misjudge me if you think i am silly enough to give you fifty dollars and simply watch you ride off
rooster i am a bonded u
mattie that weighs but little with me
i will see the thing done
rooster you never said anything about this
i cannot go up against ned pepper and a band of hard men and look after a baby at the same time
mattie i am not a baby
rooster i will not be stopping at boarding houses with warm beds and plates of hot grub on the table
it will be traveling fast and eating light
what little sleeping is done will take place on the ground
mattie i have slept out at night
papa took me and little frank coon hunting last summer on the petit jean
we were in the woods all night
we sat around a big fire and yarnell told ghost stories
we had a good time
rooster coon hunting
this aint no coon hunt it dont come within forty miles of being a coon hunt
mattie it is the same idea as a coon hunt
you are just trying to make your work sound harder than it is
here is the money
i aim to get tom chaney and if you are not game i will find somebody who is game
all i have heard out of you so far is talk
i know you can drink whiskey and snore and spit and wallow in filth and bemoan your station
the rest has been braggadocio
they told me you had grit and that is why i came to you
i am not paying for talk
i can get all the talk i need and more at the monarch boarding house
rooster stares nonplussed
he drops back into the rope bed which sets it swaying
as he stares up at the ceiling rooster leave the money
meet me here tomorrow morning at seven oclock and we will begin our coon hunt
mattie makes early morning preparations to leave as grandma turner snores
she unrolls her fathers traps and takes out a big brimmed fishermans hat and puts it on too big
she lines it with newspaper experimenting with the amount until it fits
she puts on his coat gives the sleeves a big cuff
she examines the colts dragoon
she drops apples into a sack
she finishes by folding a letter she has written and putting it into an envelope
throughout we have been hearing its contents in voice over mattie dearest mother
i am about to embark on a great adventure
or dare i call it a mission for shall any of us rest easy ere papas death is avenged
my investigations in fort smith lead me to believe that tom chaney can be found and brought to justice and i have made arrangements to that end
i will return to you once i have seen them properly carried through
mattie is cinching her gear onto little blackie
she mounts and rides off as the letter ends mattie but do not worry on my account
though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil
the author of all things watches over me
and i have a fine horse
kiss little frankie for me and pinch violets cheek
i am off for the choctaw nation
tracking toward roosters rope bed
a hat is pulled down over the face of the figure reclining in it
smoke sifts up from somewhere
mattie draws up to the figure with mounting concern
she pulls the hat off
it is the elderly chinese grocer
mattie where is marshal cogburn
the grocer reaches a pipe and pulls on it
his manner is dreamy
grocer went away
the grocer pulls an envelope from underneath his robe and hands it to mattie
he closes his eyes and drifts away
mattie pulls a scrap of paper from the envelope and reads mattie here inside is a train ticket for your return home
by the time you read this i will be across the river in the indian nation
pursuit would be futile
i will return with your man chaney
leave me to my work
matties jaw tightens
she abruptly crumples the paper
mattie gallops down an embankment to a river of some width
at the near side ferry station a raft enclosed by railing waits its guide rope strung across the river
a pilot idles on the near shore
on the far shore two small figures mounted ascend the opposite bank
mattie draws up in front of the ferryman at the edge of the river
mattie is that marshal cogburn
ferryman that is the man
mattie whos he with
ferryman i do not know
mattie take me across
he reaches for the reins of her horse
ferryman so youre the runaway
marshal told me youd show up
im to present you to the sheriff
mattie that is a story
let go my horse
i have business across the river
the ferryman is leading little blackie back up the hill toward the town
mattie cranes around to look at the two small figures across the river
they have twisted in their saddles to look back
look slim if you dont turn around and take me across you may find yourself in court where you dont want to be
i have a good lawyer
ferryman name aint slim
she looks at the dull mans unresponsive back
she twists to look across the river
the two mounted figures are breaking their look back and resuming their climb up the bank
mattie draws an apple from the bag slung round the saddlehorn and pegs it hard as she can at the ferryman
it hits him square in the back of the head
he reacts reaching to his head and dropping the reins
mattie has already leaned forward for the reins and sweeps them back
she saws little blackie around and sends him galloping for the river
mattie run little blackie
she urges the horse at the gallop into the river
the splashing and shouts have again drawn the attention of the two men across the river
as the horse goes further into the river its up and down gait slows the water offering resistance
the ferryman has run down to the bank
he stoops for a rock and throws it
it misses by a mile
little blackie leaves riverbottom and starts swimming
the two men across the river having twisted to look now rein their horses round to face the action
but they do not advance
they rest forearms on pommels and watch
little blackie is being carried downstream as he swims against a swift current
mattie good little blackie
little blackies head dips as he finds his feet again
he slogs laboriously to what is now the nearer shore
the two men up the bank impassively watch
the horse and mattie emerge fully from the river dripping
mattie taps heels against little blackies flanks and walks him slowly up the bank
she stops many yards short of the two men rooster and leboeuf
a silent standoff as little blackie breathes heavily
the two expressionless men still have not stirred
at length rooster thats quite a horse
a long pause
i will give you ten dollars for him
mattie from the money you stole from me
rooster that was not stolen
im out for your man
mattie i was to accompany you
if i do not there is no agreement and my money was stolen
rooster licks his lips thinking
leboeuf marshal put this child back on the ferry
we have a long road and time is a wasting
mattie if i go back it is to the office of the u
marshals to report the theft of my money
and futile marshal cogburn pursuit would be futile
is not spelt f u d e l
a heavy silence as cogburn stares at her
leboeuf looks between the two waiting for rooster to take action
gathering that he will not leboeuf slides off his horse
mattie watches as he walks to little blackie holding up a gentling hand for the horse to sniff at and nuzzle
he abruptly swipes the reins with one hand and with the other grabs matties ankle
he pushes momentarily to unstirrup the foot and then pulls hard tumbling mattie to the ground
leboeuf little sister it is time for your spanking
he begins to spank her
mattie help me marshal
rooster sits impassively on his horse
leboeuf still spanking now you do as the grown ups say
or i will get myself a birch switch and stripe your leg
mattie is struggling and in spite of herself starts to weep
leboeuf drags her through the dirt to a mesquite bush and snaps off a switch
leboeuf now we will see what tune you sing
mattie wet and filthy tries vainly to swat back
rooster still watches without expression as leboeuf whips the girl
mattie are you going to let him do this marshal
finally quietly rooster no i dont believe i will
put your switch away leboeuf
she has got the best of us
leboeuf looks back for a moment too surprised to speak
he then regains his resolve leboeuf she has not got the best of me
he returns to the beating
rooster evenly did you not hear me
that will do i said
leboeuf i aim to finish what i started
rooster that will be the biggest mistake you ever made you texas brush popper
the sound of a gun being cocked
leboeuf leaves off the beating to stare at rooster whose gun is drawn cocked and pointed at him
leboeuf flings the switch aside and stalks to his horse
he mutters but loud enough to be heard leboeuf hoorawed by a little girl
mattie sits looking into the fire hands clasped around her knees
leboeuf sits feet to the fire smoking a pipe that with his boyish face makes him look as if he is playing at professor
he gazes into the fire musing as he pulls at the pipe
leboeuf i am not accustomed to so large a fire
in texas we will make do with a fire of little more than twigs or buffalo chips to heat the nights ration of beans
rooster enters the circle of light with an armload of wood
and it is ranger policy never to make your camp in the same place as your cookfire
very imprudent to make your presence known in unsettled country
rooster gazes at leboeuf for a beat then dumps the wood onto the fire
he leaves the circle of light
leboeuf addresses the darkness that rooster has disappeared into how do you know that bagby will have intelligence
rooster he has a store
he reenters with a length of rope and a robe which he unrolls onto the ground
leboeuf a store
that makes him an authority on movements in the territory
rooster plays out one end of the rope to just touch the ground then starts playing out the rest as he paces
rooster we have entered a wild place
anyone coming in wanting any kind of supply cannot pick and choose his portal
he has finished making a loop around his sleeping robe
seeing this leboeuf laughs
leboeuf that is a piece of foolishness
all the snakes are asleep this time of year
as he leaves the circle of light rooster they have been known to wake up
mattie let me have a rope too
rooster a snake would not bother you
he reenters with a bottle and settles down on his robe
you are too little and bony
before you sleep you should fetch water for the morning and put it by the fire
the creekll ice over tonight
mattie i am not going down there again
if you want any more water you can fetch it yourself
rooster everyone in my party must do his job
leboeuf you are lucky to be traveling in a place where a spring is so handy
in my country you can ride for days and see no ground water
i have lapped filthy water from a hoofprint and was glad to have it
rooster if i ever meet one of you texas waddies that says he never drank water from a horse track i think i will shake his hand and give him
a daniel webster cigar
leboeuf you dont believe it
rooster i believed it the first twenty five times i heard it
maybe it is true
maybe lapping water off the ground is ranger policy
leboeuf you are getting ready to show your ignorance now cogburn
i dont mind a little personal chaffing but i wont hear anything against the ranger troop from a man like you
rooster how long have you boys been mounted on sheep down there
leboeuf leaps angrily to his feet
leboeuf my shaggy horse will be galloping when that big american stud of yours is winded and collapsed
now make another joke about it
you are only trying to put on a show for this girl mattie with what you must think is a keen tongue
rooster this is like women talking
leboeuf yes that is the way
make me out foolish in this girls eyes
rooster i think she has got you pretty well figured
mattie would you two like to hear the story of the midnight caller
one of you will have to be the caller
i will tell you what to say
i will do all the other parts myself
leboeuf continues to glare at rooster breathing heavily
rooster with a loud flap whips the robe over himself
we are close on matties upturned face
snowflakes are drifting down onto it and melting
matties eyes blink open
rooster is already at his horse packing it
leboeuf is not in evidence
mattie good morning marshal
rooster eyes on his work morning
mattie where is mr
a toss of his head rooster down the hill
performing his necessaries
mattie marshal cogburn i welcome the chance for a private parley
i gather that you and mr
leboeuf have come to some sort of agreement
as your employer i believe i have a right to know the particulars
rooster the particulars is that we bring chaney in to the magistrate in san saba texas where they have a considerable reward on offer
which we split
mattie i did not want him brought to texas to have texas punishment administered for a texas crime
that was not our agreement
rooster gives a vicious tug on the cinchrope
rooster what you want is to have him caught and punished
mattie i want him to know he is being punished for killing my father
rooster turns to her
rooster you can let him know that
you can tell him to his face
you can spit on him and make him eat sand out of the road
i will hold him down
if you want i will flay the flesh off the soles of his feet and find you an indian pepper to rub into the wound
isnt that a hundred dollars value
mattie it is not
when i have bought and paid for something i will have my way
why do you think i am paying you if not to have my way
rooster it is time for you to learn you cannot have your way in every little particular
other people have their interests
we hear spurs jingling
i am a free agent
if you find i fail to satisfy your terms i will return your money at the end of this expedition
mattie little blackie and i are riding back to the u
this is fraud
rooster god damn it
leboeuf has appeared
leboeuf whats going on
rooster testy this is a business conversation
leboeuf is that what you call it
it sounds to me like you are still being hoorawed by a little girl
rooster did you say hooraw
leboeuf that was the word
rooster i will show you hooraw
mattie there is no hoorawing in it
my agreement with the marshal antedates yours
it has the force of law
leboeuf amused the force of law
this man is a notorious thumper
he rode by the light of the moon with quantrill and bloody bill anderson
rooster those men was patriots texas trash
leboeuf they murdered women and children in lawrence kansas
rooster i have heard that too
it is a damned lie
what army was you in mister
leboeuf i was at shreveport first with kirby smith rooster what side was you on
leboeuf i was in the army of northern virginia cogburn and i dont have to hang my head when i say it
rooster if you had served with captain quantrill leboeuf captain quantrill indeed
rooster you had best let this go leboeuf
leboeuf captain of what
rooster good then
there are not sufficient dollars in the state of texas to make it worth my while to listen to your opinions day and night
our agreement is nullified its each man for himself
leboeuf is already mounting his shaggy horse
leboeuf that suits me
he saws the horse around
you have graduated from marauder to wetnurse
leboeuf gallops off with the thunder of hoofs and the jingle of spurs and rooster seething turns back to his work
as the hoofbeats recede mattie sounds a note of regret mattie we dont need him do we marshal
rooster muttering well miss his sharps carbine
its apt to get lively out here
a mule is pulling back on a cotton rope round his neck that is tied off to the porch of the ramshackle store
the beast is strangling as the rope is too tight and he is being poked with sticks by two motley dressed indian boys up on the porch
rooster enters and cuts the rope
the mule brays and canters off shaking its head rope dangling
indian youth hey
rooster is already mounting the steps to the porch
rooster call that sport do ya
he kicks the first youth hard in the ass sending him sprawling off the porch into the dirt
the second backs against the railing and rooster shoves him in the chest so that he flips backward to also land in the dirt
rooster stay here sister
i will see bagby
mattie astride little blackie holds the reins of cogburns horse
as he disappears inside the two youths climb back onto the porch
they sit at the lip feet dangling and stare sullenly at mattie
she stares back
the youths have not moved
the door bangs open and rooster emerges
mattie has chaney been here
crossing back he kicks one of the boys off the porch into the dirt again
the other youth scampers out of footreach
rooster starts down the stairs
rooster but coke hayes was two days ago
coke runs with lucky ned
he bought supplies with this
with a ching he flips a coin to mattie
she inspects it gold square with a shaped cut out in the middle
mattie this is papas gold piece
tom chaney here we come
rooster it is not the worlds only california gold piece
mattie they are rare here
rooster they are rare
but if it is chaneys it could just as easily mean that lucky ned and his gang fell upon him as that he fell in with them
chaney could be a corpse
these are a rough lot
mattie that would be a bitter disappointment marshal
what do we do
rooster mounts up
rooster we pursue
ned is unfinished business for the marshals anyhow and when we have him we will also have chaney or we can learn the whereabouts of his body
bagby doesnt know which way they went but now we know they come through here they couldnt be going but one of two ways north toward the winding stair mountains
or pushing on further west
i suspect north
there is more to rob
the youth who was kicked into the dirt is dusting himself off
he has been listening without interest
ferrington will want to know who cut loose his mule
rooster reins his horse around to go
rooster tell him it was mr
james a bank examiner from clay county missouri
youth the james boys is said to be slight frank and jesse both
rooster one of them has grown fat
the mule will not range far
you boys mend your ways or i will return some dark night and cut off one of your heads i do not say which and leave it on the stomach
of the other as a warning
rooster and mattie ride abreast along a barely defined road
rooster potter and i served with him at elkhorn tavern
even latterly our activities was by and large martial
we did though one time run across a yankee paymaster and relieve him of four thousand dollars in gold coin
squealed like it was his own money
well since hostilities was officially ended it was technically criminal so potter rode down to arkansas and i went to cairo illinois with my share started calling myself burroughs and
opened an eating place called the green frog
i married a grass widow but my drinking picked up and my wife did not like the company of my river friends
she decided to go back to her first husband a clerk in a hardware store
she said goodbye reuben a love for decency does not abide in you
i told her goodbye nola i hope that little nail selling bastard will make you happy this time
she took my boy with her too
he never did like me anyhow
i guess i did speak awful rough to him but i did not mean nothing by it
you would not want to see a clumsier child than horace
i bet he broke forty cups
he frowns and draws up looking at something
mattie follows his look
a man is hanging in a tree very high perhaps thirty feet off the ground
the body slowly twists
the head seems unnaturally large
at roosters shout something separates from the head we have been looking at not just the corpses silhouette but that of a large carrion eating bird as well perched on
the corpses shoulder and feeding at the corpses face
the bird flaps clumsily off
rooster gazes at the strung up body
rooster is it chaney
mattie i would not recognize the soles of his feet
rooster gets off his horse pulls a knife from his gear and ambles to the tree
when she arrives rooster has started sawing at the rope that ties the body off wrapped around a chest high branch stump
mattie looks up
she is looking mostly at soles of feet as the foreshortened body twists slowly high above
rooster step back now
rooster steps back as well as the almost cut through rope starts to unravel by itself crazily twisting under the pressure and gently spinning the body above
the rope snaps
it yanks violently upward slapping branches
the body drops perhaps four feet and jerks to a stop jacknifing and dancing
rooster god damn it
they both gaze up at the body
well you are going to have to clamber on up with this knife
i am too old and too fat
mattie is well up
we hear roosters voice from below rooster it had one billiard table served ladies and men both but mostly men
i tried to run it myself a while but i couldnt keep good help and i never did learn how to buy meat
i was like a man fighting bees
finally i give up and solt it and went out to see the country
mattie pauses looking down
we are over her
rooster is foreshortened a long way down looking up smoking a cigarette
he reacts to her look down rooster you are doing well
she looks up down again and then proceeds
rooster continues as well that was when i went out to the staked plains of texas and shot buffalo with vernon shaftoe and a flathead indian called olly
mattie stretches onto tiptoes reaches just gets fingers around a branch
she secures it enough with the one hand to dare to reach with the other
she hauls herself up
the mormons had run shaftoe out of great salt lake city but dont ask me what it was for
call it a misunder standing and let it go at that
there is no use in you asking me questions about it for i will not answer them
mattie looks out at waist height to the corpse which twists maybe eight feet away over the void
rooster notes her look is it our man
the face is half eaten and eyeless
mattie i believe not
she moves to start back down but rooster calls rooster no
cut him down
rooster i might know him
she climbs one more branch to arrive at the hanging branch
she shimmies out onto it and pulls the knife from roosters belt now around her waist
you see olly and me both taken a solemn oath to keep silent
well sir the big shaggies is about all gone
it is a damned shame
mattie looks down over the shoulder of the close by foreshortened corpse to the far foreshortened rooster
i would give three dollars right now for a pickled buffalo tongue
she calls out as she starts sawing mattie why did they hang him so high
rooster i dont know
possibly in the belief it would make him more dead
the sawing continues
rooster takes one step back
the rope snaps
at once the body drops
the branch unburdened bucks with mattie atop it
she gasps hugging at the branch getting swung halfway around it but then righting herself
the body hits the ground with a smack
the body is spread out on the ground below many bones now broken its posture absurd
rooster steps forward
he toes the upper body to get a view of the face
barely audible rooster i do not know this man
he reacts to something looking up the road in the direction of their heading
mattie looks out
partly obscured by intervening foliage an oncoming rider
his pace is unhurried
down on the ground rooster turns to face the rider an indian with a long bore rifle balanced sideways across the pommel of his saddle
he wears a tattered union army jacket crossed bandoliers of rifle shells and a black homburg hat with a feather in its brim
rooster drops his hand to his gun as the rider approaches
mattie looks down at the foreshortened rider pulling up under the tree
she hears a greeting and a mostly inaudible exchange
after some back and forth the indian dismounts
the men stoop at either end of the corpse
rooster grabs wrists the indian ankles
she starts to move
mattie finishes climbing down
rooster is just returning from the road to their two horses by the tree
the indian with the corpse slung over the rump of his horse is resuming his trip in the direction from which rooster and mattie came
mattie he knew the hanged man
rooster he did not
but it is a dead body possibly worth something in trade
he looks up at the sky as snowflakes start to sift down
it is snowing lightly
rooster and mattie are clomping through a stream
rooster she had taken a notion she wanted me to be a lawyer
bought a heavy book called daniels on negotiable instruments and set me to reading it
never could get a grip on it and i was happy enough to set it aside and leave texas
there aint but about six trees between there and canada and nothing else grows but has stickers on it
i went to a distant gunshot
he twists to look behind
a listening beat
at length rooster i knew it
mattie knew what
rooster were being followed
i asked the indian to signal with a shot if there was someone on our trail
mattie should we be concerned marshal
leboeuf using us as bird dogs in hopes of cutting in once weve flushed the prey
our texas friend has got just enough sense to recognize he cant outtrack me
mattie perhaps we could double back over our tracks and confuse the trail in a clever way
rooster no we will wait right here and offer our friend a warm hello and ask him where he is going
rooster waits sitting casually astride his horse in the middle of the road
snow continues to fall
a jingling noise up the road
movement an advancing rider seen through the foliage that masks a bend in the road
the oncoming rider rounds the bend
he approaches a white man with big whiskers his horse leading a packhorse loaded with clinking and jangling sundries
draped on his own horses rump is the hanged mans body
the stranger wears a fierce bear head as hat
the rest of the bearskin trails down his body as robe
he advances unhurriedly towards rooster
at a few yards distance he draws up content to sit his horse and solemnly return roosters stare
at length rooster you are not leboeuf
bear man my name is forster
i practice dentistry in the nation
also veterinary arts
and medicine on those humans that will sit still for it
rooster indicating corpse you have your work cut out for you there
bear man traded for him with an indian who said he came by him honestly
i gave up two dental mirrors and a bottle of expectorant
beat do either of you need medical attention
rooster straightens as if to rein his horse around but stops with a thought it is fixing to get cold
do you know of any place to take shelter
bear man i have my bearskin
you might want to head to the original greaser bobs
he notched a dugout into a hollow along the carrillon river
if you ride the river you wont fail to see it
greaser bob original greaser bob is hunting north of the picket wire and would not begrudge its use
the bear man tilts his head to indicate the corpse behind him
bear man i have taken his teeth
i will entertain an offer for the rest of him
a point of view looking down on a thrown together cabin dug into the flanks of a ravine
its roof meets hillside at the rear
smoke is coming out of a rough chimney
rooster and mattie have paused at the crest of the rise above the dugout to look
rooster shrugs out of his coat
rooster take my jacket
creep onto the roof
if they are not friendly i will give you a sign to damp the chimney
as mattie descends to where hillside meets structure rooster takes his rifle and walks around to the front door crude planking hung on leather strap hinges
his footsteps crunch in the snow
the door is yanked open inches and a backlit face appears over a hand holding a revolver
man who is out there
rooster we are looking for shelter
man no room for you here
the door slams
after a moment the light inside goes out
mattie arriving on the roof looks steeply down on rooster
he glances up thinking
he does not sign
he looks back at the door
rooster who all is in there
voice ride on
rooster looks up at mattie
she balls the jacket and stuffs it into the chimney
rooster takes ten paces to one side of the door and then kneels in the snow raising his rifle
muffled coughs from inside the house more than one person
activity inside yelling the hiss of fire being doused
suddenly the door flies open and bang
two shotgun blasts
slightest beat as mattie peers into the yard and then bang
shot rips through the roof just at her feet
a rifle blast from rooster
a yelp of pain from inside
rooster i am a federal officer
who is in there
speak up and be quick about it
new voice a methodist and a son of a bitch
rooster cocks his head
rooster is that emmett quincy
new voice i dont know any emmett quincy

quincy me and moon but he is hit

rooster drag him out
light that lamp
quincy tell them other officers to be careful with their guns
we are coming out
the door opens again
from the smoky black a shotgun and two revolvers are tossed out
then orange light a lamp is lit
two men emerge one limping and holding onto the other who holds high the lamp
rooster down in the snow
lie still while i cuff you
we is only two but my man on the roof will shoot you if you get feisty
rooster has coaxed the fire back to life
he peers into the large pot hanging over it
the cuffed men sit side by side on a plank bench behind a plank table staring at mattie
moons leg is bound with a large blue handkerchief
quincy sounds resentful quincy you said it was a man on the roof
i thought it was potter
rooster you was always dumb quincy and remain true to form
he stirs the pot with a wooden spoon
this heres an awful lot of sofky
was you boys looking for company
quincy that is our supper and breakfast both
i like a big breakfast
moon nods agreement but has a different thought moon sofky always cooks up bigger than you think
rooster continuing to nose around pushes the canvas cover off a crate of bottles
rooster and a good store of whiskey as well
what are you boys up to outside of cooking banquets
you are way too jumpy
quincy we didnt know who was out there weather like this
it might have been some crazy man
anyone can say he is a marshal
moon my leg hurts
rooster ill bet it does
when is the last time you seen your old pard ned pepper
quincy ned pepper
i dont know him
who is he
rooster spoons sofky from the pot into a bowl rooster im surprised you dont remember him
he is a little fellow nervous and quick
his lip is all messed up
quincy that dont bring anybody to mind
rooster sits across from the men with his bowlful of sofky and starts eating
rooster there is a new boy that might be running with ned
he is short himself and he has got a powder mark on his face a black place
he calls himself chaney or chelmsford sometimes
carries a henry rifle
quincy that dont bring anybody to mind
black mark i would remember that
rooster you dont remember anything i want to know do you quincy
i hope you dont mind
raises a spoonful
there seems to be ample
what do you know moon
moon looks at quincy who gives a hard look back
moon i dont know those boys
i always try to help out the law
rooster by the time we get back to fort smith that leg will be swelled up tight as dicks hatband
it will be mortified and they will cut it off
then if you live i will get you two or three years in the federal house up in detroit
moon you are trying to get at me
rooster they will teach you to read and write up there but the rest of it wont be so good
them boys can be hard on a gimp
moon you are trying to get at me
rooster you give me some good information on ned and i will take you to mcalesters store tomorrow get that ball taken out of your leg
then i will give you three days to clear the territory
quincy we dont know those boys you are looking for
rooster shrugs at moon
rooster it aint his leg
quincy dont go to flapping your mouth moon
it is best to let me do the talking
moon i would say if i knew
quincy we are weary trappers
he reacts to mattie staring at him
who worked you over with the ugly stick
matties look shifts to moon
mattie the man chaney with the marked face killed my father
he was a whiskey drinker like you and it led to killing in the end
if you answer the marshals questions he will help you
i have a good lawyer at home and he will help you too
moon i am puzzled by this
to rooster why is she here
quincy dont go jawing with these people moon
dont go jawing with that runt
mattie to quincy i dont like you
i hope you go to jail
my lawyer will not help you
moon my leg is giving me fits
rooster yes a young fellow like you dont want to loose his leg
you are too young to be getting about on a willow peg
you love dancing and sport carrying on
quincy easy now
he is trying to get at you
rooster i am getting at you with the truth
moon we seen ned and haze two days ago
wes supposed quincy dont act the fool
if you blow i will kill you
moon i am played out
i must have a doctor
wes supposed quincy jerks up one knee banging the bottom of the table and sloshing roosters sofky as he grabs something from his boot a knife
he slams it down on moons cuffed hand chopping off four fingers
they fly like chips from a log
as moon screams rooster mutters rooster god damn it
quincy flips the knife lightly in the air and regrabs it with blade pointing opposite wise
he twists and rears with cuffed hands to plunge the knife into moons chest
rooster has his gun out now and fires
quincy jerks back hit in the face
blood spatters mattie
quincy still seated slides awkwardly down the wall
moon has fallen to the floor knife in chest
moon oh lord i am dying
rooster and mattie stand over him
rooster i can do nothing for you son
your pard has killed you and i have done for him
moon dont leave me lying here
dont let the wolves rip me up
rooster ill see you are buried right
you tell me about ned
where did you see him
moon two days ago at mcalesters store
they are coming here tonight to get remounts and sofky
they just robbed the katy flyer at wagoners switch if the snow didnt stop em
eyes wide he gazes down his body
i am bleeding buckets
i am gone
send the news to my brother george garrett
he is a methodist circuit rider in south texas
you can write care of the district supervisor in austin
rooster should i tell him you was outlawed up
moon it dont matter he knows i am on the scout
i will meet him later walking the streets of glory
rooster dont be looking for quincy
matties point of view the dark shoulders of the wooded hills funneling down to the ravine
it is all very still except for falling snow
mattie stands outside the cabin door hugging herself keeping watch
the door opens and rooster emerges
rooster hobble our mounts in the corral out back
we dont know when theys coming
from the threshold he surveys the inside of the cabin
mattie is he dead
rooster he is
i stowed the bodies under the blanket there
just needs to look right enough to get em in the door
something he sees inside prompts rooster to quickly reenter the cabin
he reemerges fist closed on something
well climb that ridge there fort up somewhere gives us a clear shot
he flings and whatever he was holding lands faintly pit a pat in the woods
mattie what was that
rooster finishes hunkering down
he takes out his revolver and put a cartridge into the one empty chamber under the hammer
he places the revolver on a log and puts the sack of cartridges next to the revolver
he leans his rifle against the log
he looks out
his point of view of the cabin below peaceful smoke drifting from the chimney
mattie what do we do now
rooster takes out a sack of corn dodgers and starts to eat
rooster we wait
they ride up what we want is to get them all in the dugout
i will kill the last one to go in and then we will have them in a barrel
mattie you will shoot him in the back
rooster it will give them to know our intentions is serious
then i will call down and see if they will be taken alive
if they wont i will shoot them as they come out
i am hopeful that three of their party being dead will take the starch out of them
mattie you display great poise
rooster it is just a turkey shoot
there was one time in new mexico when bo was a strong colt and i myself had less tarnish we was being pursued by seven men
i turned bo around and taken the reins in my teeth and rode right at them boys firing them two navy sixes i carry on my saddle
well i guess they was all married men who loved their families as they scattered and run for home
mattie that is hard to believe
rooster what is
mattie one man riding at seven
rooster it is true enough
you go for a man hard enough and fast enough and he dont have time to think about how many is with him he thinks about himself and how he
may get clear of the wrath that is about to set down on him
mattie why were they pursuing you
rooster they was in the nature of a posse
mattie you were particeps criminis in something other than the case of the yankee paymaster
rooster i robbed a high interest bank
you cant rob a thief can you
i never robbed a citizen
never took a mans watch
mattie it is all stealing
rooster that is the position they took in new mexico
he is suddenly alert and raises a hand for quiet
there is the sound of a rider approaching slowly
rooster is puzzled one man
i didnt figure them to send a scout
their high point of view a mounted figure has entered the ravine
he travels its length and stops his horse before the cabin and dismounts
we hear the jingle of spurs
it is leboeuf
distant calling toward the cabin leboeuf hello
leboeuf unholsters a gun
he walks to the cabin opens the door and peers in
rooster starts to rise about to call out as leboeuf enters and closes the door
we hear hoofbeats
mattie we have to warn him marshal
rooster is looking to the mouth of the ravine
rooster too late
mattie follows his look
their high point of view four riders just entering the ravine
they look back to the cabin
from inside faintly leboeuf oh
the door opens and leboeuf stumbles out wide eyed
he sees the approaching riders
they see him
they slow approaching with caution
leboeuf looks at them glances back over his shoulder looks forward again
mattie what do we do marshal
rooster we sit
what does he do
the riders stop several paces from leboeuf
they spread in a line facing him
words are exchanged we cannot make them out
leboeuf unholsters a gun and points it at the four men
rooster he is a fine one for not drawing attention to himself
the four men slouched astride their horses are not impressed by leboeufs gun
there is more talking
rooster him in the woolly chaps is lucky ned
he refers to the mounted man who does most of the talking
lucky ned now speaks to the men on either side and the two corners advance closing a circle around leboeuf
leboeuf looks warily from side side swinging his gun to cover the group
none of the riders bothers to unholster a gun
the man to leboeufs right lifts a rope off his saddle and casually twirls it
the man to his left says something leboeuf looks left and the man to his right drops the rope around leboeuf and pulls it tight
leboeuf is jerked off his feet gun dropping
the mounted man backs his horse taking the play from the rope
he dallies the free end round his saddlehorn
two of the men slide off their horses
one of them heads for the cabin door
rooster well thats that
the rifleshot just at matties ear is deafening
the man heading to the cabin drops shot in the back
the two horses that are now riderless rear and mill panicked
the horse towing leboeuf also skitters spooked as its rider looks wildly about and starts shooting
lucky ned looks toward our vantage point and also begins firing
rooster is methodically aiming and firing but in the commotion below his first couple of shots dont tell
his third drops lucky neds horse
the other unmounted man is frantically trying to snatch up the reins of one of the loose horses
the man towing leboeuf spurs his horse toward one of the free horses trying to grab it
leboeuf is dragged past plunging horses hooves
a cacaphony of screaming horses crackling gunfire from the basin and the boom of roosters rifle
the unmounted man has managed to grab a halter
he climbs with difficulty aboard the skittish horse
the rider towing leboeuf cuts loose the towline
he gallops toward ned pepper with an arm outstretched to help him aboard
rooster is tracking him with his rifle
lucky ned grabs the extended arm
as he begins to swing up there is the boom of roosters rifle
the rider pitches off the horse but lucky ned manages to stay on and swipes up the reins
he gallops off
the one other surviving horseman follows him
there is one dead horse in the basin a live unmounted horse racing crazy circles and three still bodies
one is leboeufs
rooster well that didnt pan out
leboeuf is moaning
rooster walks toward him trailed by mattie glancing along the way at the two dead men
rooster you managed to put a kink in my rope pardner
leboeuf i am theverely injured
something is wrong with leboeufs speech
bloody saliva bubbles copiously from his mouth
rooster yes you got drug some
leboeuf altho shshot
by a rifle
rooster stoops to examine
rooster that is quite possible
the scheme did not develop as i had planned
you have been shot in the shoulder but the ball passed through
it will pain you in the years to come
what happened to your mouth
leboeuf i believe i beh mythelf
rooster slaps lightly down at leboeufs chin signaling that he should open up
leboeuf does and rooster digs in with two dirty fingers dipping his head to peer in as he pokes this way and that
rooster couple of teeth missing and yes the tongue is bit almost through
do you want to see if it will knit or should i just yank it free
i know a teamster who bit his tongue off being thrown from a horse
after a time he learned to make himself more or less understood
bloody saliva bubbles out with the word
rooster withdraws his fingers
rooster whats that now
rooster very well
it is impossible to bind a tongue wound
the shoulder we will kit out
mattie goes to inspect the two outlaws corpses as rooster pokes back leboeufs shirt to look at the wound
its too bad
we just ran across a doctor of sorts but i do not know where he was headed
leboeuf i thaw him too
ith how i came to be here
mattie neither of these men are chaney marshal
rooster i know it
i know them both
the ugly one is coke hayes
him uglier still is clement parmalee
parmalee and his brothers have a silver claim in the winding stair mountains and i will bet you thats where lucky neds gang is waiting
well sleep here follow in the morning
mattie we promised to bury the poor soul inside
rooster ground is too hard
if these men wanted a decent burial they should have got themselves kilt in summer
falling straight down a windless night
we hear a murmuring male voice from inside the cabin
mattie is finishing rubbing down her horse
mattie sleep well little blackie
she puts up the brush and pulls an apple from her apple bag
i have a notion that tomorrow we will reach our object
we are hot on the trail
the horse chomps up the apple and she rubs its muzzle as it chews
it seems that we will overtake tom chaney in the winding stair mountains
i would not want to be in his shoes
the horse huffs and blows
we are raking the four dead men who have been carelessly propped against the outside wall to sit in an irregular row
mattie passes them with a brief look and opens the door and the murmuring voice from inside fans up louder
as mattie enters
we see leboeuf musing before the fire as he cleans his sharps carbine an awkward operation given the injury to his shoulder now bandaged
all we see of rooster seated further from the fire is a pair of boots and legs stretching into darkness
mattie goes to the pot of food on the fire
leboeuf azh i understand it chaney or chelmzhford azh he called himshelf in texas shot the shenatorzh dog
when the shenator remonshtrated chelmzhford shot him azh well
you could argue that the shooting of the dog wazh merely an inshtansh of malum prohibitum but the shooting of a shenator izh indubitably an inshtansh of malum in shay
rooster is a voice in the darkness rooster malla men what
mattie malum in se
the distinction is between an act that is wrong in itself and an act that is wrong only according to our laws and mores
it is latin
we hear the pthoonk of a bottle yielding its cork followed by the pthwa of the corks being spit out
rooster i am struck that leboeuf is shot trampled and nearly severs his tongue and not only does not cease to talk but spills the banks of english
we hear liquid slosh as the bottle is tipped back
leboeuf placidly i wuzh within three hundred yardzh of chelmzhford once
the closhesht i have been
with the sharpsh carbine that izh within range
but i wuzh mounted and had the choish of firing off hand or dishmounting to shoot from resht which would allow chelmzhford to augment the dishtansh
i fired mounted and fired wide
we hear the smack of lips releasing bottleneck and a wet breath
rooster you could not hit a man at three hundred yards if the gun was resting on gibraltar
leboeuf the sharpsh carbine izh an inshtrument of uncanny power and precizhun
rooster i have no doubt that the gun is sound
wide three riders leave the cabin single file
jump in pushing mattie who rides last in line
leboeuf is in front of her
rooster leads head tipping momentarily back to swig from a bottle
he then half hums half scats a tune
mattie twists to look behind
her point of view pulling away from the cabin against the wall of which the four dead men are now semi drifted over with snow
roosters humming has stopped and we hear his voice rooster that was johnny in the low ground
there are very few fiddle tunes i have not heard
once heard they are locked in my mind forever
it is a sadness to me that i have sausage fingers that cannot crowd onto a fretboard little fat girls at a cotillion
he launches into another song interrupted by the slosh of liquid as he takes a drink
mattie looks forward again and leboeuf turns to look back at her
he keeps his voice low leboeuf i dont believe he shlept
still without looking back rooster projects rooster fort smith is a healthy distance leboeuf but i would encourage the creature you ride to try to make it in a day
out here a one armed man looks like easy prey
leboeuf and a one eyed man who cant shshoodt
why dont you tshurn back khoghburn
rooster i will do fine
he twists around to gaily hector leboeuf i know where the parmalees claim is
i am uninjured i am provisioned and we agreed to separate
leboeuf in conscschiensh you cannot shite our agreement
you are the pershon who shshot me
leboeuf has a point marshal
it is an unfair leg up in any competition to shoot your opposite number
rooster god damn it
i dont accept it as a given that i did shoot leboeuf
there was plenty of guns going off
leboeuf i heard a rifle and felt the ball
you mishshed your shshodt khoghburn admit it
you are more handicapped without the eye than i without the arm
rooster missed my shot
i can hit a gnats eye at ninety yards
he reins his horse up hastily tips the bottle to his mouth to make sure it is empty and then hurls it high
he pulls out a navy six gun and fires
the bottle reaches the height of its arc untouched and drops
rooster cocks his head at the landed bottle several paces distant
he shoots again and misses
he shoots a third time and the bottle shatters
rooster the chinaman is running them cheap shells on me again
leboeuf i tdhought you were going to shay the shun was in your eyezh
that izh to shay your eye
rooster starts to dismount finishing in a semi controlled fall
he dusts one knee and reaches into his saddlebag
he pulls out a corn dodger and heaves it up
the corn dodger is obliterated
he reaches two corn dodgers from the saddlebag
rooster two at one time
he hurls them and quickly fires twice
nothing happens he quickly fires three times at the falling corn dodgers missing
scowling he throws a single corn dodger and is just raising his gun when another gun goes off making him jump
leboeuf has fired with a gun in his left hand missing
rooster i will chunk one high
he reaches into the saddlebag and hurls it high
both he and leboeuf fire
leboeuf your bullet
if you hit what you aim at eckshplain my shoulder
mattie gentlemen shooting cornbread out here on the prairie is getting us no closer to the ned pepper gang
rooster one more this will prove it
he tosses a corn dodger and fires
it holds to its arc and falls
leboeuf is smug
leboeuf azh i shed khoghburn
rooster roars rooster did you not see the piece fly off
some time later
rooster sways in the saddle holding a bottle humming
he tips his head up and tilts the bottle all the way back confirming that this one too is now empty
riding forward he leans out of the saddle stretching low to one side his hand extended with the bottle
wavering he places it upon a large rock as he passes
his arm waves for balance as he straightens but he keeps his place on the horse
he half turns propping himself with one hand on his saddle back to address mattie and leboeuf rooster find our way back
framed by a mine entrance
rooster steps into the square wood beam frame of the entrance looking in
a beat and he pulls out his six gun and fires in
wide outside rooster before the entrance mattie and leboeuf standing close by
the little camp is deserted
rooster turns to pan the hills
at length rooster lucky ned
very faint echo
faintly from our distant perspective leboeuf very good khoghburn
it is raining
the campfire is roughly canopied by a hide draped at a cant over a pair of tree branches
mattie pours hot water from a kettle into a large tin cup holding a corn dodger
she takes a fork and starts mashing the dodger into mush
leboeuf sits before the fire coat over his head one hand on his jaw which is swollen
leboeuf cogburn does not want me eating out of his store
mattie that is silly
you have not eaten the whole day and it is my store not his
rooster let him starve
rooster bellicose stumbles to the fire with a few thin branches
as he leans in toward the fire the water draining off the low edge of the canopy drums onto his neck
he waves a hand back at it like a man swatting flies
rooster he does not track
he does not shoot except at foodstuffs
leboeuf that wazh your idea
rooster he does not contribute
he is a millstone with opinions
he is a man who walks in front of bullets
rooster sits heavily a stretching leg kicking away an empty bottle
rain patters on his hat
he is a drag brake for horses
leboeuf drew single handed upon the lucky ned pepper gang while we fired safely from cover like a band of sly injuns
mattie it is unfair to indict a man when his jaw is swollen and tongue mangled and who is therefore unable to rise to his own defense
leboeuf i can thpeak for mythelf
i am hardly obliged to anther the ravingth of a drunkard
it ith beneath me
he rises and starts gathering his things
i shall make my own camp elthwhere
it ith you who have nothing to offer khoghburn
a shad picture indeed
thish izh no longer a manhunt it izh a debauch
the texath ranger preththeth on alone
rooster take the girl
i bow out
leboeuf a fine thing to deshide once you have brought her into the middle of the choctaw nation
rooster i bow out
i wash my hands
mattie gentlemen we cannot fall out in this fashion so close to our goal with tom chaney nearly in hand
rooster erupts rooster in hand
if he is not in a shallow grave somewhere between here and fort smith he is gone
thanks to mr
leboeuf we missed our shot
we have barked and the birds have flown
gone gone gone
lucky ned and his cohort gone
your fifty dollars gone
gone the whiskey seized in evidence
the trail is cold if ever there was one
i am a foolish old man who has been drawn into a wild goose chase by a harpy in trousers and a nincompoop
leboeuf can wander the choctaw nation for as long as he likes perhaps the local indians will take him in and honor his gibberings by making him chief
you sister may go where you like
i return home
our engagement is terminated
i bow out
he whips his robe over himself
wide on mattie staggering toward us carrying a saddle
we boom down to bring little blackie into the foreground as mattie takes the last few stumbling steps forward almost at a run so as to let her inertia help
her heave the saddle up onto the horses back
mattie i am going with you
leboeuf cinching a saddle onto his woolly horse looks around
leboeuf oh that izh not poshible
mattie have i held you back
i have a colts dragoon revolver which i know how to use and i would be no more of a burden to you than i was to the marshal
leboeuf that izh not my worry
you have earned your shpurzh that izh clear enough you have been a regular old hand on the trail
but cogburn izh right even if i would not give him the shatishfaction of consheding it
the trail izh cold and i am conshiderably diminished
mattie how can you give up now after the many months youve dedicated to finding chaney
you have shown great determination
i misjudged you
i picked the wrong man
leboeuf i would go on in your company if there were clear way to go
but we would be shtriking out blindly
chelmshford izh gone we have chaished him right off the map
there izh nothing for it
i am bound for texash and it izh time for you to go home too
he swings himself up onto the horse
the marshal when he shoberzh izh your way back
mattie i will not go back
not without chaney dead or alive
leboeuf i misjudged you as well
i eckshtend my hand
he does dropping a hand gloved in rough suede
she refuses to take it
he remains with hand extended
she hesitates sees there is no give and reaches for up for the hand
he saws the horse around and sets it to a prancing walk his spurs jingling
the sound recedes leaving behind roosters snoring from the campfire
roosters snores bump up at the cut
mattie enters gazes down for a thinking beat at the passed out lawman then lies down on her robe
she lies still gazing up
after a long beat she abruptly rises
she recedes toward the horses
as she reaches them we hear little blackie snort and blow
mattie returns with a length of coiled rope
she plays it out in a loop around her robe
she lies down again
she closes her eyes
we are high and close on rooster asleep
face mottled red he looks like hell
he emits a symphony of respiratory noises as breath fights through layers of phlegm
reverse on mattie looking down at him
wider on the forlorn campsite mattie standing rooster awkwardly sprawled sleeping leboeuf gone
close on a bucket matties hand enters to grab it
we hear rushing water
mattie descends carefully stiff legged down a steep slope thick with trees and brush
she emerges onto the bank of a fast flowing stream shallow at this point and loud
mattie takes a couple of steps into the water to dip the bucket
soft behind her we see four horses watering at the opposite bank just downstream
mattie stoops to fill the bucket
turning as she straightens she sees the four horses
surprised she drops the bucket and stares
the horses huff and blow in the water
they are not wild they wear tack but there is no rider in sight until a man straightens and emerges from behind one of the horses
the first thing we notice about him is the silhouette of the rifle projecting over one shoulder slung to the mans back with a piece of sash cord
he looks at something floating by in the stream matties bucket
he looks up
we jump closer the man has a black mark on his forehead
seeing mattie who still gapes at him he hastily swings his rifle round and trains it on her
he takes cautious splashing steps forward
chaney well now i know you
your name is mattie
you are little mattie the bookkeeper
isnt this something
he grins relaxing
he slings the rifle back over his shoulder
mattie yes and i know you tom chaney
chaney what are you doing here
mattie i came to fetch water
mattie pulls the flour sack from her coat pocket and works carefully at the cord that cinches it shut
chaney i mean what are you doing here in these mountains
mattie i have not been formally deputized but i am acting as an agent for marshal reuben cogburn and judge parkers court
mattie has the cinch loose
she reaches the colts dragoon out of the sack and points it at chaney
i have come to take you back to fort smith
chaney looks at the gun
he grins and puts hands on hips
chaney well i will not go
how do you like that
mattie there is a posse of officers up on the hill who will force you to go
chaney that is interesting news
how many is up there
mattie right around fifty
they are all well armed and they mean business
what i want you to do now is come on across the creek and walk in front of me up the hill
chaney i think i will oblige the officers to come after me
mattie if you refuse to go i will have to shoot you
then you had better cock your piece
mattie gives a dismayed look at the gun and tries to pull the hammer back
it has a heavy pull she struggles using two thumbs
chaney watches smiling
all the way back til it locks
mattie i know how to do it
she pulls the hammer back further and we hear it notch
she looks up
you will not go with me
chaney i think not
it is just the other way around
you are going with me
i will mattie fires
chaney shocked takes a staggering step back
mattie stumbles and falls back under the recoil into the stream but careful to hold the gun high and dry
she awkwardly reclaims her footing and retrains the gun
chaney is looking down at his bleeding side
chaney i did not think you would do it
mattie what do you think now
chaney one of my short ribs is broken
it hurts jiggers every breath i take
mattie you killed my father when he was trying to help you
i have one of the gold pieces you took from him
now give me the other
she is struck by a worrying thought
she hastily recocks the gun
chaney i regret that shooting
ross was decent to me but he ought not to have meddled in my business
crashing from the brush up the hill and a voice rooster mattie
mattie i am down here
chaney is taken into custody
chaney i was drinking and i was mad through and through
nothing has gone right for me
there is yelling from the other bank now too
mattie no you are just a piece of trash that is all
chaney everything is against me
now i am shot by a child
he sloshes suddenly forward water kicking up before him
she squeezes the trigger but the gun dry fires
chaney grabs the gun and flings it away then holds on to mattie and slaps her
mattie help me
two men burst through the brush from chaneys side of the river
one is in woolly chaps lucky ned pepper
the other is taller and dressed almost formally in a linen suit and string tie and a bear coat
both men bear winchester repeating rifles
chaney is dragging mattie to their bank slapping at her along the way
rooster emerges from his side of the riverbank carrying a side arm
the men exchange fire
lucky ned to chaney take them horses you got and move
he grabs mattie from chaney and keeps her between himself and the far bank as he fires again
one hand to his bleeding side chaney lunges for the horses leads
rooster has retreated back to the tree cover as has the well dressed man on our side
intermittent gunshots and the panicked neighing of horses
lucky ned falls back into the trees with mattie and starts pulling her up the steep hill
chaney follows pulling the string of horses
he is breathing hard and blood stains the front of his shirt
lucky ned to chaney get on up that hill
dont you stop
he twists mattie around to face him and we see him clearly for the first time
part of his upper lip and three of his front teeth are missing
who all is down there
mattie marshal cogburn and fifty more officers
lucky ned throws mattie to the ground
he puts a muddy boot on her neck
lucky ned tell me another lie and i will stove your head in
mattie manages to choke out mattie just the marshal
lucky ned cogburn
do you hear me
you answer me rooster
i will kill this girl
you know i will do it
roosters voice the girl is nothing to me
she is a runaway from arkansas
lucky ned that is very well
do you advise me to kill her
roosters voice do what you think is best ned
she is nothing to me but a lost child
a short beat through which we hear only the rush of riverwater
then roosters voice again think it over first
lucky ned i have already thought it over
you get mounted double fast
if i see you riding over that bald ridge to the northwest i will spare the girl
you have five minutes
he breaks open his rifle and starts to reload
rooster i will need more than five minutes
lucky ned i will not give you more time
rooster there will be a party of marshals in here soon ned
let me have chaney and the girl and i will mislead them for six hours
lucky ned too thin rooster
your five minutes is running
no more talk
he pulls mattie to her feet
roosters voice trails away roosters voice i am leaving but you must give me time
lucky ned gives mattie a rough push
lucky ned up that hill
mattie advances lucky ned giving periodic shoves from behind
a stout young man with a shotgun leaps out from behind a slab of limestone in front of them
he has a round face and idiot eyes
he makes loud turkey gobbling noises at mattie
though mattie is startled lucky ned does not immediately react but he does finally tire of the turkey noises lucky ned quiet there
the idiot makes a pig squealing sound in acknowledgment and then falls quiet loping alongside mattie and lucky ned
mattie you will not shoot me
lucky ned is grim lucky ned i will do what i have to do
they are ascending out of the trees onto a bare rock ledge not quite at the crest of the mountain
the rock floor is uneven and broken by fissures and holes
a cave like setback at the far end of the rock shelf is half curtained with a hide
a rough camp
a cookfire burns on the open rock
two coffeepots warm leaning against the inside of the fires piled stone perimeter
a skillet holds bacon
a man squats at the fire holding a piece of bacon turned to watch lucky ned and matties approach
he wears a filthy union army uniform with officers boards
his mouth is an of surprise
mattie can i have some of that bacon
lucky ned help yourself
have some of the coffee
mattie i do not drink coffee
i am fourteen
lucky ned we do not have buttermilk
and we do not have bread
we are poorly supplied
what are you doing here
tom chaney has reached the rock ledge and he charges mattie with a yell
chaney i will wring your scrawny neck
lucky ned knocks him aside
lucky ned let that go
farrell see to his wound
what are you doing here
mattie i will tell you what and you will see that i am in the right
tom chaney there shot my father to death in fort smith and robbed him of two gold pieces and stole his mare
her name is judy but i did not see her down at the river
i was informed rooster cogburn had grit and i hired him out to find the murderer
a few minutes ago i came upon chaney watering the horses
he would not be taken in charge and i shot him
if i had killed him i would not be now in this fix
my revolver misfired
lucky ned they will do it
it will embarrass you every time
most girls like to play pretties but you like guns do you
mattie i do not care a thing in the world about guns
if i did i would have one that worked
chaney i was shot from ambush ned
the horses was blowing and making noise
it was that officer that got me
mattie how can you sit there and tell such a big story
chaney squatting with his shirt pulled up for the ex soldier to work on his wound now rises
chaney that pit is a hundred feet deep and i will throw you into it and leave you to scream and rot
how do you like that
mattie no you wont
this man will not let you have your way
he is your boss and you must do as he tells you
chaney turns to lucky ned who has a spyglass to his eye scanning a ridge across the river
chaney five minutes is well up
lucky ned speaks quietly without lowering the glass lucky ned i will give him a little more time
from somewhere in the woods below we hear the idiots gobbling noises
chaney how much more
lucky ned til i think he has had enough
the voice of the well dressed man floats up from the woods well dressed man he is gone ned
i can see nothing
we had best make a move
lucky ned hold fast a while there doctor
mattie looks at chaney moaning in pain as the ex soldier works on his side
mattie why doesnt the doctor do that
lucky ned replies absently still gazing out lucky ned he is not a medical doctor
was that rooster waylaid us night before last
mattie it was marshal cogburn and myself
lucky ned yourself eh
you and cogburn quite the posse
he sees something and hastily raises the glass
a horseman is ascending the treeless ridge across the river with a riderless horse little blackie in tow
at the top he pauses and turns and draws a revolver from his saddle and points it skyward
we see the gun kick and breathe gunsmoke
a second later we hear the shot
lucky ned lowers the glass and takes a gun and shoots skyward
he raises the glass again
the horseman turns away and proceeds on over the crest
he is gone
lucky ned turns to mattie
he comes and squats at the fire
lucky ned your friend is gone
you are alone
the well dressed man and the idiot trudge up from the woods onto the rock ledge
the man in the dirty uniform continues to perform crude field surgery on chaney digging into his side with a knife to extract the bullet
as chaney moans the idiot makes calf bawling noises in imitation
well dressed man we must move ned
lucky ned you are too nervous doctor
it will be hours before he is back with help
lucky ned turns back to mattie
what happened to quincy and the kid
mattie they are both dead
i was in the very middle of it
it was a terrible thing to see
do you need a good lawyer
lucky ned i need a good judge
what about coke hayes the old fellow shot off his horse
mattie dead as well
his depredations have come to an end
lucky ned poor coke
he rode back for me
coke hayes had spine and could keep his wits in a tight spot
dead now but he should have been dead ten times afore now
your friend rooster does not collect many prisoners
mattie he is not my friend
he has abandoned me to a congress of louts
lucky ned you do not varnish your opinions
well dressed man are we staying here for chat
the idiot is still bawling
chaney grabs a stone and flings it at him and the idiot scampers back making goat noises
chaney grabs moaning at the wound aggravated by this fresh exertion
the man in officers boards laughs
soldier do an owl harold
chaney let us cut up the winnings from the katie flyer
lucky ned straightens from the fire and begins to collect his meager belongings
the other men follow suit
lucky ned there will be time for that at the old place
chaney i will saddle the grey
lucky ned i have other plans for you
chaney must i double mount with the doctor
well dressed man no
lucky ned no it will be too chancy with two men up if it comes to a race
you will wait here with the girl
when we reach mas house i will send carroll back with a fresh mount
you will be out by dark and we will wait for you at the old place
chaney i dont like that
let me ride with you ned just out of here anyway
lucky ned no
we are short a horse
it cant be helped
chaney marshals will come swarming
lucky ned hours if they come here at all
they will guess we are all gone
mattie i am not staying here by myself with tom chaney
lucky ned that is the way i will have it
mattie he will kill me
you have heard him say it
he has killed my father and now you will let him kill me
lucky ned he will do no such thing
tom you know the crossing at cypress forks near the log meetinghouse
when you are mounted you will take the girl there and leave her
do you understand that tom
if any harm comes to this child you do not get paid
chaney stares at lucky ned
his gaze then swings to the idiot
chaney harold let me ride up with you
chaney farrel i will pay you fifty dollars out of my winnings
i am not heavy
soldier ha ha
do the calf again harold
the men clanking with gear cross the rock ledge and descend into the woods
in the quiet chaney is disconsolate
chaney everything is against me
mattie you have no reason to whine
if you act as the bandit chief instructed and no harm comes to me you will get your winnings at the old place
we faintly hear the rest of his party mount up and gallop off
chaney drops heavily before the fire to sit staring
chaney they will not wait for me at the old place
lucky ned has left me knowing i am sure to be caught when i leave on foot
mattie he is sending a mount
chaney that was a story
keep still now
i must think over my position and how i may improve it
a silent beat
mattie where is the second california gold piece
chaney continues to stare silently into the fire
mattie what have you done with papas mare
chaney keep still you little busybody
more brooding silence
mattie are you thinking about the old place
if you will let me go i will swear to it in an affidavit and once you are brought to justice it may go easier on you
chaney rises glaring at her
chaney i tell you i can do better than that
i do not intend to be caught
i need no affidavit
he is striding toward her
she backs toward the ledge
all i need is your silence
and i will have it
without breaking stride he plows into her good hand raised to catch her by the throat
she tumbles backward chaney on top of her sweating and snarling
your father was a busybody like you
there are always people who will tell you whats right
on her back mattie struggles but chaney straddling her has her pinned
his good hand is still on her throat
she claws at it
he swats her with his free hand
her clawing stops
chaney is wincing from the swing of his own arm
as he leans over her his opened wound dribbles blood onto mattie along with his sweat
in honesty i do not regret shooting him
he thought tom chaney was small
lucky ned thinks the same
and you would give me an affidavit
he reaches back awkwardly toward his calf with his bad hand groaning with the stretch
we hear the schlick of steel and his hand reappears holding a knife taken from a leg sheath
you are all against me
everything is against me
he pushes against the underside of matties chin stretching her neck
her eyes roll down in their sockets to watch as chaney regrips the knife and lowers it to her throat his knuckles whitening with tension
but here at least i have matters in hand and once i have done for you whack a rifle stock swings into frame connecting with chaneys head
his head snaps to one side and then lolls back as he slowly straightens ropey drool and blood pouring from his mouth
he sways briefly and then collapses onto mattie
a hand enters to pull him off
mattie blearily props herself on her elbows
leboeuf is panting and sweating from his climb
he gazes down at chaney
once he has breath leboeuf sho that ish chelmthford
shtrange to be sho closhe at lasht
mattie how is it you are here
leboeufs look breaks from chaney
he pulls his pipe from his pocket and lights it
leboeuf i heard the shotsh and went down to the river
he crosses the rock ledge
cogburn outlined a plan
hizh part i fear izh rash
reacts to hole but that izh a pit there
mind your footing
he skirts the large hole and reaches the shelfs far lip and gazes out
before him is a steep drop off
we see the very crowns of near pines and then four hundred yards away the land flattening to an open meadow
mattie also gazing out comes up beside leboeuf
mattie a plan
leboeuf points with his pipe
leboeuf he returnzh for lucky ned
lucky ned the parmalees and the doctor are just entering the low meadow riding away
as they do so rooster enters at the far side facing
he draws one of his navy sixes as he advances
mattie one against four
it is ill advised
leboeuf he would not be dishuaded
he and mattie both watch as below the parties advance on each other at a walk
eighty yards separating them they halt
rooster and lucky ned eye each other
after a beat lucky ned well rooster will you give us the road
rooster hello ned
how many men are with the girl
lucky ned just chaney
our agreement is in force she was in excellent health when last i saw her
rooster farrel i want you and your brother to stand clear
you as well doctor
i have no interest in you today
lucky ned what is your intention rooster
do you think one on four is a dogfall
rooster i mean to kill you in one minute ned
or see you hanged in fort smith at judge parkers convenience
which will you have
ned pepper laughs
lucky ned i call that bold talk for a one eyed fat man
idiot koo koo roo
rooster fill your hand you son of a bitch
he puts the reins in his teeth grabs his other revolver with the hand now free and spurs his horse
mattie watches him charge
the facing four charge to meet him
mattie shoot them mr
leboeuf too far moving too fasht
over the distant laughter of the idiot the crackle of gunfire commences
rooster turns his head to either side as he fires bringing his good eye into play
the idiot is gaily waving a revolver over his head not firing squawking like a chicken as he charges
a shot from rooster kills him and swipes him neatly off his horse
farrel parmalee has a shotgun
shot peppers rooster
he returns fire
farrel parmalees horse is hit
it stumbles and farrel is dashed forward snapping his neck
the doctor indian rides past sliding down and hooking an ankle on his saddle so that he may ride in the cover of his horses body
he makes for the treeline on the far side of the meadow
rooster and lucky ned are charging each other both firing
they pass each other both still mounted but roosters horse has been hit and it falls pinning roosters leg
his guns are gone lost in the fall
rooster bleeding from sprayed shot in neck face and shoulder struggles and unpins his leg
leboeuf sits cross legged and brings the butt of his sharps carbine to rest against his injured shoulder
he nudges the gunstock back and forth looking for the anchor that will cause him the least pain
he cocks his head to sight puffing pipesmoke
lucky ned is reining his horse around with his left hand
his right arm dangles
he walks his horse toward rooster who is getting to his feet
lucky ned well rooster i am shot to pieces
it seems neither of us is to see judge parker
he drops the reins to reach out a gun with his one working arm
leboeuf oh lord
he squeezes the trigger
he screams as the gun roars and bucks back into his shoulder
rooster is facing lucky ned
lucky ned raises his gun at rooster and is shot in the chest
as we hear the weakly distant guncrack ned flops backward slides halfway down one side of the saddle and dangles briefly foot tangled in a stirrup horse standing unperturbed
then he drops
mattie whoops as leboeuf groans
mattie some bully shot
four hundred yards at least
leboeuf sets the rifle down and gropes at his shoulder
leboeuf i am afraid i have a rock is brought down on his head by tom chaney
leboeuf has collapsed and is motionless
chaney drops the rock and stoops for the rifle
mattie is already dragging it away
she grabs it up
mattie stand up tom chaney
chaney stands nearly straight as much as his injuries will allow and boom
the blast catches chaney in the chest and he is blown back off the ledge looking surprised
he falls to oblivion
but the carbine recoil pushes mattie stumbling back and this with the bad footing at the lip of the pit behind her sends her falling
mattie is tumbling
she bounces down a very steep slope disturbed earth tumbling with her protruding roots and slender upgrowing foliage slapping at her on her descent
as she descends more or less feet first something snags an ankle and her inertia sends her upper body on down past the pinned leg
she jerks to a halt head downmost on the steep slope
the patter of falling dirt subsides
mattie lying face up does a painful half sit up to look around
above her her left foot is snarled through some roots
well beyond very high weak light defines the mouth of the pit
using her elbows she pivots scooting her upper body uphill so that she is no longer below her foot
she reaches the cuff of her pants on the trapped leg and pulls it up to expose the shin
a splinter of broken bone has punctured the skin
she pulls the cuff back down
she stretches to slip fingers between her boot and the roots in which it is fouled
she just manages to work in two fingers in wrenching around the root has cinched tight
she tugs feebly at the root which shows no signs of give
she looks back up
the small hole of weak daylight dust drifting up toward it
are you alive
arms tiring she lays back again against earth
she looks around
partway round the pit just at her level something difficult to discern in the semi dark two mirroring shapes close to each other is it the soles of a pair
she props herself partway up
higher view they are boots worn by a corpse stretching away from us foreshortened
the mans skull has been partly shattered by the protruding rock against which it rests
mattie surveys the body
her attention is caught by something the skeletal remains are still clothed and there seems to be something held by a bandolier strapped across the chest over the bodys decomposing
blue shirt but beneath a tattered vest
a sheath is just visible high on the strap near the corpses shoulder
the butt end of a knife juts out
mattie stretches reaching
she can just get to a boot
the mans remains seem to be fairly light
they drag across earth raising dust tending to slide away with the grade of the pit
mattie reels the body in careful not to let go and lose it down the hill
she pulls shoe pants cuff pants knee belt
the bandolier is close
her fingers curl around shirt and pull
the shirts buttons softly pop and fiber dust drifts up as the fabric falls to pieces
rib cage is exposed beneath
mattie hastily reaches and curls fingers around ribs
she is about to get the knife when a glistening something inside the rib cage guts
starts to slowly move
but it cant be guts it is gliding coiling under its own power
a faint rattle
mattie screams as the ball of waking snakes quickens
one snake starts to slowly emerge and she bats the body away
she pushes and kicks with her free leg as much as her pinned attitude will allow
the body coming to pieces slides dustily down into the dark
fiber and bone dust float up toward us
we hear rattles
mattie hastily reaches for the root that pins her and in a panic pulls looking back toward the body
the root holds fast
a snake is sluggishly and sinuously weaving up the earth toward her
she muscles her body upward so that once again her pinned leg is bottom most
another snake is behind the first
several more behind that
as the snakes advance to the level of her pinned leg mattie freezes
the first snake continues climbing weaving up the slope alongside matties body
she watches it come on its blunted head with its flicking tongue inches from her face
the head passes the body goes coiling by
another snake undulates onto her pinned leg
roosters voice are you there
careful to keep still eyes on the advancing snakes mattie i am here
more snakes climb onto her
roosters voice can you clamber out
mattie i cannot
a large snake is winding onto her shoulder
she gingerly places a hand for it to coil onto it does she holds it at arms length and gently shakes it off
there are snakes
rooster appears in the mouth of the pit
he has a rope wrapped round his waist and he starts to descend half walking half hopping against the pit wall
mattie winces and looks down at one hand
a small snake wrapped round her wrist has its fangs in the meat of the hand
rooster what is that
she flaps her hand and the snake plops off
mattie i am bit
a burst of orange as rooster descended to the level of the lead snakes starts firing his revolver
more orange lightning flashes
the pit fills with roiling gunsmoke
rooster starts to stomp as well as fire
he kicks the more sluggish specimens toward the bottom of the pit
he reaches mattie and takes out a knife
mattie does mr
rooster he does even a blow to the head could silence him for only a few short minutes
where are you bit
she shows her hand and he makes two slices in the flesh and squeezes out blood
as he does so he is in mild distress having swallowed a good piece of his pipestem
can you move
mattie my foot is pinned and leg broken
rooster stoops with the knife and one slice frees the booted foot
he wraps one arm around matties waist and tips his head back and bellows rooster i have her
up with us
the rope tautens and starts pulling rooster helping with his feet
little blackie led by a wobbly leboeuf finishes pulling rooster and mattie from the pit
rooster is already unwrapping the rope from his waist and talking to leboeuf as he and mattie emerge rooster i will send help for you as soon as i can
dont wander off
mattie we are not leaving him
rooster heaves her up onto the back of little blackie leboeuf helping though blood still flows down one side of his face
rooster i must get you to a doctor sis or you are not going to make it
to leboeuf the girl is snakebit
we are off
he swings up behind her and nods down to leboeuf
i am in your debt for that shot pard
leboeuf never doubt the texash ranger
rooster reins the horse around and spurs it
lebouef shouts after ever shtalwart
the horse takes to the steep slope reluctantly with stiff legs rooster kicking it on
tree branches slap at him and take his hat
his face already peppered with shot gets new scratches
mattie is woozy
as little blackie crosses the field at full gallop mattie looks blearily at the littering bodies of horses and men
next to lucky neds body his horse saddled and riderless swings its head to watch as rooster and mattie pass
matties eyes are closing
matties eyes half open
little blackie plunges on through a rough road in woods but slower now his mouth foaming
rooster come on you
mattie we must stop
little blackie is played out
horrible noises are indeed coming from the horse but rooster is grim rooster we have miles yet
he leaves off whipping the horse and takes out his knife
he leans back and slashes at the horses whithers
little blackie surges
a locked down shot as horse and riders enter at a gallop and recede
it has started to snow
mattie is flushed and soaked with sweat
the horse is laboring for breath
rooster gives inarticulate curses as he kicks it on
mattie looks ahead barely visible in the moonlight a man mounted bareback rides on ahead
a sash cord holds a rifle to his back
he recedes outpacing us disappearing into the darkness and the falling snow
mattie he is getting away
rooster who is getting away
rooster hold on sis
mattie is falling
it is unclear why
her legs squeeze the horses flanks
her hand tightens on the horses mane
roosters arm reaches around to hold her
little blackie is giving out going to his knees and then all the way down
rooster hangs on to mattie as the horse sinks
he pulls her clear lays her on the ground and then steps away from her taking out a gun
the horrible noises coming from the horse end with a gunshot
rooster reenters to pick up mattie but she screams at him and claws at his face opening fresh gashes
he ducks his head as best he can to avoid the claws but that is the extent of his reaction
rooster put your arms around my neck i will carry
he presents his back and she relents clasping her arms
he rises with a pained wheeze and he starts jogging with mattie piggie back
bouncing at his shoulder she twists to look back
in the dark the darker shape of the dead horse growing smaller
mattie turns forward again eyes drooping
rooster is loudly wheezing as he carries mattie before him now his jog slowed to an unsteady walk
her eyes are opening again
they are now on a proper dirt road
rooster staggers around a turn and does a barely controlled stumble to his knees and then sits heavily back mattie in his lap
up ahead is the front porch of bagbys store the building dark
rooster sits gasping
matties voice is thick mattie where are we
rooster takes out his gun weakly raises his arm and fires into the air
he sits panting
rooster i have grown old
the door of the distant store opens and someone emerges holding a lamp peering out into the dark
we are looking into the window of a moving train
looking out past us is a thin forty year old woman
reflected in the window is a sizable railyard and then as the train slows a station
reading backward in the mirror of the window is the station stop memphis
we hear the voice familiar from the opening of the movie of the grown mattie ross voice over a quarter of a century is a long time
as the train eases to a stop the woman mattie steps down
one sleeve of her dress is pinned up
voice over i had written a letter of thanks to marshal cogburn with an invitation to visit along with the fifty dollars i owed him
in his reply he promised he would try to call next time he came to fort smith with prisoners
brief though his note was it was rife with misspellings
mattie goes along the platform holding a small bag in one hand and crushed against its handle a flier
the marshal did not visit nor did he communicate further
i had not been conscious during his leavetaking by the time bagby rode us to fort smith my hand had turned black
i was not awake when i lost the arm
i later learned that mr
leboeuf recovered fully
when the marshals found him he was searching the pines below the rock ledge for tom chaneys body
he found it and took it back to san saba for the reward
it was well earned
in the scene mattie calls peremptorily to a young boy on the platform mattie boy
she shows him the flier the cole younger and frank james wild west show riding
dont leave the ladies and the little ones behind
also featuring rooster cogburn
he will amaze you with his skill and dash
memphis fairgrounds july the boy looks up and points
mattie crosses the platform and further along descends to the railyard
the cars of the wild west show are parked along a siding
they display gaudily painted scenes of men on rearing horses firing six guns of conestoga wagons war bonneted indians bandana wearing bad men
three featured performers have their own vignetted scenes each depicted as a youngish man engaged in wild west hell raising each with his name painted beneath cole younger frank james
and unrecognizable but for the eyepatch rooster cogburn
below roosters name is the sublegend he rode with quantrill
he rode for parker
around the rail cars cowboys and some indians mill more wobegone than their painted representations
mattie asks someone along the way for directions and is pointed toward the rear of the train
voice over little frank had sent me the flier
he had chaffed me through the years over the fact that i had not married calling the marshal my secret sweetheart and he sent a note with the advertisement skill
and dash its not too late mattie
little frank and victoria have always liked jokes and they are all right in their place
i have never held it against either one of them for leaving me at home to look after mama and they know it for i have told them
mattie speaks to two men who sit on the rear platform of the rear car
they are old men drinking coca colas
one doffs his hat and rises when mattie addresses the pair the other stays seated slurping from his bottle
standing man yesm i am cole younger
this is mr
it grieves me to tell you that you have missed rooster
he passed away what three days ago when the show was in jonesboro arkansas
buried him there in the confederate cemetery
reuben had a complaint what he referred to as night hoss and i believe the warm weather was too much for him
we had some lively times
what was the nature of your acquaintance
mattie i knew the marshal long ago
we too had lively times
thank you mr
as she turns to go she addresses frank james who has been staring at her keep your seat trash
men load in a muddy pine coffin
chalked on the coffin top cogburn yell county hold at station voice over i had the marshals body removed to dardanelle
the railroads do not like to carry disinterred bodies in the summertime but i had my way
the boxcar door is slammed and the train starts to move off
people love to talk
they love to slander you if you have any substance
they said well she hardly knew that man
mattie stands with a prayer book
there is a light lazy fall of snow
voice over its just like a cranky old maid to pull a stunt like that burying him in the family plot
they say i love nothing but money and the presbyterian church and that is why i never married
it is true that i love my church and my bank
i will tell you a secret
those same people talk mighty nice when they come in for a crop loan or a mortgage extension
i care nothing for what they say
i would have married a baboon if i had wanted and fetched it its newspaper and slippers every morning but i never had time to fool with it
she leaves striding purposefully past the headstone
we show the headstone and beyond her receding figure
reuben cogburn a resolute officer of parkers court her figure softens as it recedes
voice over anyway a woman with brains and a frank tongue and one sleeve pinned up and an invalid mother to care for is not widely sought after
i never did see mr
leboeuf again but if he is yet alive i would be pleased to hear from him
i judge he would be in his seventies now and nearer eighty than seventy
i expect some of the starch has gone out of that cowlick
time just gets away from us
