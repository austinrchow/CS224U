written by paddy chayefsky panoramic view of the hospital a vast medical complex a sprawling pastiche of architecture extending ten blocks north and south on first avenue and east to
the hospital was founded in the late th century and there are still a few begrimed victorian bedlams and bastilles among the buildings
mostly though it is medical modern white and chrome and lots of glass and concrete shafts and rotundas
a spanking new community mental health clinic towers among the tenements at the northern end of the complex
on the far side of first avenue a twenty story apartment house with recessed balconies and picture windows to house the resident staff has just recently been completed and next
to it eight ghetto buildings are being demolished to make way according to the construction companys sign for a new drug rehabilitation center to be completed in we should all live so long
this is where the shattering sounds of construction are coming from
a block length of generators and cement and demolition machines are pounding crashing screaming
traffic honks and brays up first avenue
it is a cold spring morning a
a station wagon pulls up to the holly pavilion
a tiny fragile white bearded old man almost lost in his overcoat is helped from the rear of a station wagon and slowly led to the entrance doors by a
middle aged nurse
on monday morning a patient named guernsey male middle seventies was admitted to the hospital complaining of chest pains
the old man is now in a wheelchair pushed by a hospital orderly down the corridor
he had been referred by a nursing home where the doctor had diagnosed his condition as angina pectoris
now it is axiomatic that nursing home doctors are always wrong
the old man shirtless is propped on the edge of the bed wheezing
schaefer a young intern in white uniform perches beside him with the old mans chart in his lap taking down his history
the other patient in the two bedded room a middle aged man is comatose and all rigged up with i
s and catheters
the intern who admitted mr
guernsey however accepted the diagnosis and prescribed morphine a drug suitable for angina but not at all suitable for emphysema which is unfortunately what the old man actually had
within an hour
two orderlies rush the old mans bed with of course the old man in it past the nurses station and into a waiting elevator
the patient became unresponsive and diaphoretic and was raced up to intensive care with an irregular pulse of blood pressure over respiration rapid and shallow
an oxygen mask is applied to the old mans face by the resident
the resident on duty now compounded the blunder by treating the old man for pulmonary edema
he gave him digitalis diuretics and oxygen
this restored the old mans color
the elevator door opens
two orderlies wheel the sleeping man on his bed back around the nurses station and down the corridor to his room
and he was sent back to his room in the holly pavilion ruddy complected and peacefully asleep
the old man is back in his room sleeping serenely his tiny body making barely a ripple in the white sheet that covers him
the room is in hushed shadows
a yellowish light diffuses into the room from the half opened bathroom door
the other patient in the room remains as before comatose and silent
in point of fact the patient was in co narcosis
all the lights are on now
nurse penny canduso and an orderly are wrapping the old man in a post mortem shroud
brubaker the senior resident is giving hell to schaefer the intern
and died at seven thirty that evening
the shrouded body of the old man is wheeled out of the room
camera stays on the vacated bed
i mention all this only to explain how the bed in room became available
pan from bed to schaefer now alone in the room and regarding the empty bed with frowning interest
schaefer is a scraggly young fellow bespectacled with a contemporary mess of hair and a swinging unkempt moustachio
hold on schaefer
the intern involved was a prickly young buck named schaefer who had a good thing going for him with a technician in the hematology lab
in the haphazard fashion of hospital romances dr
schaefer had been zapping this girl on wheelchairs stretchers pantry shelves
schaefer moves for the phone on the table between the two beds
in the kitchen in the morgue in the dark corners of corridors
schaefer speaks softly into the phone
standing up sitting down so you can imagine what an available bed meant to him
on phone hey sheila this is howard sheila
i got us a bed for tonight
a real honest to god bed
freeze on close up of the beaming lubricious schaefer on phone as interspersed with credits the following scenes dark
just a bit of moonlight streaking through the not quite closed bathroom
the hallway door opens and a young woman carrying a top coat slips quickly in giggling like hell followed by schaefer who is likewise giggling and admonishing her to be
her name is sheila
sheila notices the other patient in the room sleeping away and looks questioningly at schaefer who reassures her as he removes her coat
after which he strips off his own white jacket and trousers and hangs them in the armoire
the girl asks in a hoarse whisper if theyre going to get totally nude and wonders if thats such a good idea
for an answer schaefer fondles her crotch
they both giggle they both shush each other they giggle again theyre both stoned
the girl unzippers her dress
the dark room is filled for the moment with the flurry of undressing flung garments elbows legs and arms bumpings into each other and sheila saying between giggles boy i
sure hope nobody walks in
they eventually wind up on the unoccupied bed and the scene ends looking across the sleeping profile of the patient in the other bed as schaefer and his girl thump
away at each other with much creaking of springs moans groans giggles and the white limbed patterns of fornication
dark silent hushed
the fun and games are over
sheila is in front of the armoire
she slips back into her dress after which she tiptoes back to the bed where schaefer is deeply asleep smiling in postcoital peace
sheila bends shakes his shoulder
whispers ill see you
schaefer smiles grunts sleeps on
a cold newly dawned sun shines down on the vast sprawling complex of the hospital
desultory early morning traffic on first avenue
the night shift of nurses is closing out another nights work which has been on the whole uneventful
the head nurse mrs
reardon hunches over her paperwork
nurse elizabeth rivers sits at the desk beside her resting her head on the palm of one hand
nurses aid j
miller crosses with an armful of linens
she disappears into the pharmacy and supply areas behind the nurses station
in the west corridor nurse lucinda perez glances at her watch then pads down to room
a cold gray light cheerlessly illuminates the room
nurse perez checks the i
on the comatose patient who is in the bed nearest the door
then she turns to regard the other bed which gives her pause
schaefer is lying on this bed rigid eyes dilated pupils staring unseeing
tube sticks out of his naked right arm
nurse perez doesnt quite know what to make of the fact that dr
schaefer is lying on that bed with an i
tube sticking out of him looking dead
frowning she reaches out a tentative hand to shake his naked shoulder
there is of course no response
a terrible suspicion enters nurse perezs mind and she closes her eyes and sighs a long shuddering sigh
then she opens her eyes and with a second and briefer sigh reaches for schaefers neck to take his pulse
clearly the result is not encouraging
she sighs another short sigh and regards schaefers unblinking dilated pupils
its all a bit too much for her she shuffles to the window and stares out into the gray morning where things are a little more comprehensible
once again she returns to the bed regards schaefers death mask
she raises the bedsheet and for one short but appreciative moment considers schaefers naked body
she lets the bedsheet carefully down
she sighs again
trying again with little hope doctor schaefer
she sighs turns and leaves the room
nurse perez frowning and pursing her lips moves slowly back to
head nurse reardon is still bent over her paperwork
listen did you know doctor schaefer was in eight o six because hes dead
late forties continues her painstaking paperwork grunts what
im just telling you dr
schaefer is dead
works on after a moment looks up what do you want perez
look i dont know what the hell this is all about but dr
schaefer is in room with an i
running and hes dead
i didnt even know he was sick
regards perez a moment perez what the hell are you talking about
appeals to nurse rivers coming out of the floor pharmacy do you know what the hell shes talking about
well maybe im going crazy
i dont know
isnt room the patient guernsey
i mean did something happen i dont know about
perez i dont know what youre talking about
this is the nuttiest thing i ever saw
schaefers in room dead
the one whos always grabbing everybodys ass
to nurse rivers do you know what shes talking about
i dont know what shes talking about
to perez what do you mean doctor schaefers in room dead
i mean hes lying on the far bed stone dead and with an i
tube sticking out of him
and if you dont believe me maybe you just ought to get up and look for yourself
with a short irritable sigh mrs
reardon abandons her paperwork and heads down the west corridor followed by nurses perez and rivers
camera tracks as mrs
reardon turns to nurse rivers
all right maybe youd better call mrs
venetian blinds drawn
tv set on a gray coarse grained square
herbert bock years old a large man bulky disheveled apparently fell asleep in a chair while watching television the night before
the bed still has its spread on but is rumpled
bock is in trousers and shirt collar opened barefooted
the reading lamp is the only light in the room except for the sheen of gray hissing from the television
newspapers litter the floor
books two day old plates of food yesterdays mugs of coffee cigar stuffed ashtrays a shirt a pair of pants a winter overcoat a battered gray fedora have been slung
phone on the bedtable rings again begins to penetrate the sotted sleep of the man
two bottles of booze one empty and a clump of glasses are on the coffee table in front of bock
he grunts opens an eye
bock suddenly exsufflates in a snorting grunt
he stands shuffles to the bed a big sodden fellow picks up the receiver interrupting its next ring
he sinks sitting on the bed
this is dr
christie what is it
its all right id be getting up in a few minutes anyway
im sorry i missed that
would you say it again
yes i know him schaefer the stud with the glasses who fancies the nurses
im afraid i dont understand that what do you mean
was he sick
i mean was he
uh what was the cause of death
was he being treated
i dont understand
what was he doing in the bed
you did say he
christie did you call the office
good well ill
no no its all right
ill be getting my wake up call any minute anyway
he returns the receiver to its cradle sits disoriented unbuttoning his shirt
long shot of the hospital now alive and jumping
taxis pull up and out of the large u shaped drive
a noisy picket line of about twenty chanting protesters parade with signs in an uneven ellipse
chanting two four
help the poor
most of the placards are slogan y people yes
heal the poor
two protesters move toward the street waving and yelling at an approaching car
one a young white fellow wears a sandwich board that goes into the matter at some length we protest the eviction of black in the back seat of the car
sits john sundstrom handsomely graying tanned early fifties the director of the hospital
he looks up
that young demonstrator dr
ives a sandy haired bespectacled man of in a white doctors coat sidles to the cars open rear window angrily shouting
what do you say sundstrom
how much longer do you think our monopolistic exclusionary racist policies will work
were the hope
sundstrom lowers his window and gives his driver directions
he exits in the background parking area where he notices bock emerging from his car
sundstrom waits for him
so hows it going herb
bocks sour glance says it all
he locks his car joins sundstrom and the two men start down the concrete ramp
after a moment one of my interns dropped dead this morning
im sorry to hear that
i understand youve moved out to a hotel
it got that bad with phyllis
its been that bad for twenty four years
are you going to be solicitous
they trudge across the u shaped entrance drive pausing to let a car pass
listen herb im the guy who brought you into this hospital so i think i can skip the diplomatic overtures
marty stopped me in the hall yesterday very upset
he had just had lunch with you and said you sounded suicidal
marty tends to be extravagant but hes not the only one
jack singer mentioned the other day youve been boozing it up a lot
and lets face it youve been sloughing off
i understand you havent even been doing rounds
im going to do rounds today
they pick their way around the shuffling line of protesters many with afro haircuts and tinted glasses including a black minister and four young white activists
early arriving secretaries chat in the doorways
the corridor itself connects to the bryce pavilion pediatrics gynecology and obstetrics so a steady stream of traffic moves back and forth
bock and sundstrom enter the corridor and slow to a halt to continue their chat by a wall
herb want a couple of days off
go down to montego bay get drunk get laid get a little sun
for gods sake john im fifty three years old with all the attendant fears
i just left my wife after twenty four years
standard case of menopausal melancholy
maybe you ought to have a talk with joe einhorn
i dont want to see a psychiatrist
stop worrying about me
all i have to do is get my ass back to work and ill be fine
im sorry ive caused you concern
he sets off down the long corridor to the elevators
milton mead the administrator of the hospital comes out of one of the offices waves a good morning to bock who acknowledges him and plods on
mead comes up to sundstrom now moving toward his own office
sid just called from st
lukes and hes heard that the demonstrators up there are planning a march to join the bunch down here
he wraps his arm around meads shoulders ushering him into his office area did you call the cops
the elevator door opens
out comes bock overcoat unbuttoned now
he clumps to the nurses station
an unusual number of nurses seems to be there
through the doorway of the floor pharmacy we can see nurse rivers of the night shift being comforted by nurse perez of the night shift and nurse edwards of the
the head morning nurse mrs
donovan is at the desk hunched over her paperwork
nurses are always hunched over their paperwork
nurse felicia chile is also seated at the desk doing some paperwork
head nurse donovan looks up briefly as dr
back to her paperwork theyre all in eight o six doctor
i think ill just let mrs
christie tell you about it
bock lumbers off for the west corridor through a press of activity
kitchen workers trundle creaking portable carts nurses aids and attendants pop in and out of doorways bearing trays and used dishes
a robed patient or two ambulates along the hall
morning rounds have just started which means a clump of white jacketed white trousered young doctors are gathered in a gaggle at the far end
the group includes senior resident monroe brubaker junior resident harvey biegelman interns sam chandler and irving ambler and another medical student all lounging outside a door discussing the condition of
the patient within
chandler is presenting the case from a handful of notecards in his hand
the others lean against the walls listening
they wear shirts and ties with the exception of ambler who is new to the floor and still in the canonical white tunic under his jacket
they are all in their twenties and have swinger sideburns and occasional mustaches
when he spots dr
bock senior resident brubaker turns the rounds over to biegelman and joins bock just outside
as he approaches rolls his eyes oh boy
ive seen some pretty good snafus but this one
i mean theres a certain splendor to this one
one of the night nurses a float thought schaefer was a patient and plugged an i
he was a diabetic you know
what do you mean a nurse plugged an i
oh its really a screwed up story doctor
you see what happened was we had an old man in that bed who died last night so the bed was available
and you know schaefer
hes sammy stud
and he talked a nurse into zapping him on that bed
i think it was a girl from hematology hes been running with
my god its a roman farce
the door to room opens and an assistant administrator named hitchcock pokes his head out
i thought i heard you out here doctor
he too rolls his eyes heavenward in an expression of incredulity bock makes a noise and goes into
aside from hitchcock the room includes mrs
christie the director of nurses a fusty forty six in streetclothes head night nurse mrs
reardon in uniform head evening nurse mrs
dunne mid fifties who had apparently been called in from home because shes in mufti and wearing a winter coat and of course the comatose patient and the dead dr
christie is instructing the two nurses
ill need one from both of you three copies and i suggest you do that right now
the forms are in my office
dunne on the verge of tears head bobbing looks up to bock
im really so terribly sorry about this dr
regarding schaefers rigid death mask as i understand it one of the nurses inadvertently administered an i
to schaefer here
how the hell could that happen
listen i think we ought to straighten this out somewhere else
yes very good idea
oh god what a mess
they all file out now bock in the rear into
they all go along to the nurses station where mrs
reardon and mrs
dunne disappear into the rooms behind
christie leads hitchcock and the trailing bock to the tv solarium but dr
brubaker is now holding his rounds there
he stands quietly expounding on the uses of heparin a decoagulant
one of the patients last night had hemorrhaged consequent to injudicious use of that drug
listening the other young doctors make notes
christie leans against the wall
apparently the conference is to take place in the corridor
background activity continues normally
with a sigh well these things happen of course
i suppose id better call the medical examiner
i still dont know what happened
well it took an hour to get it sorted out
it seems a patient named guernsey died last night in eight o six but that information wasnt given to the night nurses
these things happen
bock has begun to get the drift
a curious state of apathy settles over him
rattling on at any rate according to the cardex the patient guernsey was down for twenty five milligrams of sparine q h so mrs
reardon sent nurse perez to give him his twelve oclock shot
meanwhile it seems dr
schaefer had usurped that particular bed for his own purposes
brubaker suggests it was for a love tryst and some weight is given that hypothesis by the fact that dr
schaefer was naked
trying to give his attention to this i get the drift mrs
in other words nurse perez went in and sedated dr
schaefer thinking it was the patient guernsey
what i dont understand
if i may finish doctor
well after perez gave him his shot she noticed the i
on the bed had been pinched off and she reported that back to mrs
reardon who then assigned nurse rivers to restart the i
bock sighs now rivers was a float
she didnt even know the staff people on the floor and nobody knew what the patient guernsey looked like anyway since hed only been admitted that morning
so she plugged an i
the doctor in him intrudes into his lassitude a five percent glucose solution wont kill anybody
did he have any other ancillary conditions
he wasnt dehydrated was he
didnt anybody bother to go in to check him during the night even under the impression he was merely a patient
was he hyperasthmolic
did he have a bad heart
he must have had some kind of thrombosis
i want the post done here mr
and you and i better have a little chat mrs
christie about your excessive use of float nurses
ive got nearly a thousand nurses in this hospital
gathering rage and every time one of them has her period she disappears for three days
my doctors complain regularly they cant find the same nurse on the same floor two days in a row
what the hell am i supposed to tell that boy schaefers parents
that a substitute nurse assassinated him because she couldnt tell the doctors from the patients on the floor
my god the incompetence here is absolutely radiant
i mean two separate nurses walk into a room stick needles into a man and one of those was a number eighteen jelco
tourniquet the poor sonofabitch anchor the poor sonofabitchs arm with adhesive tape and its the wrong poor sonofabitch
i mean my god
where do you train your nurses mrs
he is aware his voice has risen and is attracting attention
he lowers his voice all right wrap him up and get him down to pathology
im especially interested in his blood sugar
a liter of glucose never killed anybody
your ladies mustve done something else to him
will there be anything else doctor
before you call the family doctor i wish youd talk to mr
mead about this
wed like naturally to avoid litigation
bock heads abruptly down the corridor to the elevators
a corridor of offices
this is the department of medicine where bock and all the senior staff members of the department have their offices
its quiet since most of the staff are away at their various specialties about the hospital
bock comes up the corridor still wearing the overcoat he arrived in some hours ago
he has only managed to unbutton it in all the time it has taken him to reach the corner office
gilt lettering on the door reads department of medicine and below that dr
small office with two desks
as department chief bock gets two secretaries
both are at their desks one on the phone miss gloria lebow and the other rattling away on the ibm miss stephanie mcguire
it would seem not
bock waves a listless hand exits into
the modestly imposing office is lined with medical tomes
bock slips out of his coat and jacket and hangs them in the closet
in shirtsleeves with his tie a bit askew fastidiousness in dress is not bocks strong point he crosses to his desk and sits breathing more heavily than his small exertions
would seem to warrant
he seems exhausted
there is a knock on the door
miss lebow enters holding a filing envelope stuffed with papers
a few things have been piling up
would you like to go into them
a guttural noise indicates yes
miss lebow pulls up a chair opens her folder
esterhazy wants to start hiring temporary people to cover the summer vacations
he says last year some of the replacement people didnt receive their checks until they waited six months
he wonders if you could do something about getting these people paid more promptly
she places a sheet of paper on the desk in front of bock
he tries to give his attention to it
drones on miss aronovici complains the lab reports are coming in slow into the e
i called dr
immelman about that and she said three microscopes have been stolen out of her lab in the last two months
charley waters also complains about pilferage
ive clumped all those together for you
she lays a sheaf of memos in front of bock who stares at them blankly now as you know doctor weve agreed to take over the local ambulance cases as
part of the hospitals commitment to the community and its created a serious overload in the e
i dont know why this was dumped in our lap but
bock obviously isnt up to all this
he waves a limp hand to stop miss lebows morning report
staring at his desktop find out if dr
einhorn is in his office yet
ophthalmology or psychiatry
suddenly stands never mind
ill look in myself
he lumbers across the room and out into
and down past miss mcguire rattling away on her ibm and out into
down past several closed doors stopping at a door marked department of psychiatry dr
a secretary at her desk sips coffee and reads a paperback novel
is he in
the doctor is obviously in
he can be seen through the open door sitting at his desk writing in a notebook
bock leans in
can you give me a few minutes joe
short chunky bespectacled late fifties of course
bock goes in closes the door behind himself
bock looks only at the floor
ill at ease ive been having periods of acute depression recently
apparently its becoming noticeable
a number of people have remarked on it
anyway john sundstrom thought it might be a good idea if i spoke to you about it
do you want to sit down herb
im not good at confessional
he ambles around well what can i tell you
the last year two three
it goes way back i suppose
i can remember entertaining suicidal thoughts as a college student
at any rate ive always found life demanding
im an only child of lower middle class people
i was the glory of my parents
my son the doctor
well you know
i was always top of my class
scholarship to harvard
the boy genius the brilliant eccentric
terrified of women clumsy at sports
god joe how the hell do i go about this
i understand you just separated from your wife
i left her a dozen times
she left me a dozen times
we stayed together through a process of attrition
obviously sado masochistic dependency
my home is hell
weve got a twenty three year old boy i threw out of the house last year
a shaggy haired maoist
i dont know where he is presumably building bombs in basements as an expression of his universal brotherhood
ive got a seventeen year old daughter whos had two abortions in two years and got arrested last week at a rock festival for pushing drugs
they let her off
the typical affluent american family
i dont mean to be facile about this
indeed he does not
he is horrified by the fact his eyes are wet and he is verging on tears
he turns away quickly
i blame myself for those two useless young people
i never exercised parental authority
im no good at that
oh god im no good at this either
joe lets just forget the whole thing
im sorry i bothered you
he starts for the door
how serious are your suicidal speculations herb
at the door i amuse myself with different ways of killing myself that dont look like suicide
i wouldnt want to do my family out of the insurance
digitalis will give you an arrhythmia
a good toxologist would find traces
potassiums much better
sixty milli equivalent
of course then youre stuck with how to get rid of the hypodermic
forty milli equivalent
gives you plenty of time to dispose of the evidence
you seem to have given considerable thought to the matter
you ought to know a man who talks about it all the time never does it
i dont know
i see a man whos exhausted emotionally drained riddled with guilt and has been systematically stripping himself of his wife children friends isolating himself from the world
are you impotent
what does that mean
it means i havent tried in so long i dont know
lets just drop the whole thing joe
i feel humiliated and stupid
all i have to do is pull myself together and get back into my work
im sorry i troubled you
take care of yourself
ill see you
before einhorn can say a word he slips away and disappears into his own office
the score of protesters outside the pavilion still move in an uneven ellipse and shout two four
help the poor
ives the bespectacled demonstrator who shouted at sundstrom earlier is removing his sandwich boards and giving them to his replacement
he hurries across the walk and into
ives cuts through the congestion of people and moves swiftly up the long corridor leading to the farkis building unbuttoning his overcoat as he goes into
and comes out as the elevator opens
this is a laboratory floor and the corridors are empty except for a white uniformed orderly leaning against a wall and for one young woman in a white smock in
the background who waves to the young man before disappearing into one of the rooms
ives fishes out a ring of keys and unlocks the door to his own lab
he enters into
dingy and cheerless place as labs go
ives hangs his coat in the cupboard loosens his tie unbuttons his suit jacket squats on a stool reaches over for a loose file on the work table opens the
file and begins to read the papers inside
a door clicks open behind him and without looking up he waves briefly to whoever has entered
camera dollies to full shot of ives frowning over his notes
we are suddenly conscious of a white uniformed presence behind him
we know its medical personnel but we cant see the face
ives starts to turn to the presence behind him when suddenly a small hospital sandbag is whipped down on his head and he slumps forward his forehead thumping against the
black surface of the lab table
high angle shot establishing the passing of hours
sun high overhead traffic on first avenue an impenetrable river of honks and hoots
at a crosswalk a loose procession of fifty or so shouting demonstrators bearing placards flows toward the main gates
their posters read fight dope not dopes
and save our kids from the skids
which is what they now chant save our kids
from the skids
the demonstration moves through a handful of city cops where our original group of twenty still ramble around chanting two four
help the poor
the staff elevator doors open and bock comes out wearing his long white doctors coat unbuttoned
hanging about the nurses station are dr
brubaker and a few young men in white
they come quickly to respectful attention at bocks entrance
clattering trays dominate the lunchtime atmosphere
the doctors move off toward the solarium on the east corridor overlooking the river
they pass a curious quartet of people consisting of a very handsome young woman in her late twenties in an out of fashion miniskirt she has great legs long and
an elderly man uncomfortable in city clothes and unmistakably an indian a tall overcoated man in his forties wearing a ministers white collar and a distinguished man dressed in fashionable
gray who is trying to persuade the young woman of something
the young woman and the indian stand absolutely still silent impassive
the minister is more fidgety
to brubaker en passant whos that exotic group
murmurs you got me
theyve been here about an hour
i think theyre with the old man in eight o six
bock and brubaker trailed by young doctors move into the tv room
perry said he picked the tuberculosis and the liver nodes for today right
because thats the one i studied up
a hell of a case
some twenty five or thirty young doctors two or three of them black three or four of them women fill the room
at bocks entrance they find places around the walls sofas soft chairs and benches
the tv set has been pushed into a corner and a large portable blackboard has been set up
this is the chief of service round attended by every available intern and resident
somebody closes the door just as two young doctors come hurrying in
all right whos presenting
people of all ages sit around on aluminum chairs arranged around the walls of the room
all are in streetclothes
some speak to each other
a line of people extending into the hallway and holding their charts waits for a lady from the accounting department taking blue cross numbers
this lady from accounting is mrs
cushing late forties bespectacled and testy
she calls out at large
is there anybody seated who hasnt been to see me first
is there anyone here who hasnt given me their health insurance number
her phone rings
she picks it up
well i dont know sybil
whats his name
to a man on line at her desk thrusting his chart out to her
would you wait a moment please
im on the phone cant you see im on the phone
rummaging through a stack of charts large paper forms in quadruplicate of course not do they ever
hangs up takes two charts from the desk pushes through the waiting line would you mind please
i have to get through do you mind
she makes her way to the door and goes out into
which is congested
on phone give me that one again
facing the desk are six curtained treatment rooms mostly open to view
behind the desk are a supply room and another treatment room
both are occupied the former by a paranoid lady wringing her hands in a paranoid rush and listened to by a very patient young intern
they follow me everywhere
three big black men
naked completely exposed
right in the street
hanging down to their knees
theyre waiting out there for me now
and in the other room a man in his thirties is being treated for some sort of head lacerations
in one treatment room the chief of emergency service dr
spezio a man in his late thirties along with an intern an anesthesiologist and a nurse is bent over a naked and comatose young black woman of eighteen covered somewhat
with a sheet
shes a junkie being intubated i
a small endotracheal tube has been inserted into her mouth
this is the most melodramatic of the varied activity here
a middle aged man complaining of chest pains is lying clothed in another treatment room a nurse attends him
an asthmatic middle aged woman sits in still another room being administered her mg
of amenophylene subcutaneously
the curtains on another room are drawn for privacy
on chairs in the corner sit a teenage boy with a badly sprained ankle and an elderly man bathing his hand in an enamel basin held in his lap
a young mother with a five year old daughter with a badly cut arm is being attended to by the back wall
the emergency room nursing supervisor miss aronovici a pretty woman in her mid twenties is sterilizing the little girls wound
cushing makes her way to miss aronovici
they detest each other
did you call upstairs and tell them to admit a patient named mitgang
continuing to treat the little girl the concussion
i dont know
they just called me
they said you didnt fill out the chart
and where do you come off sending anyone up to admitting without my okay
miss aronovici turns to mrs
cushing regarding her sweetly
sally would you get the fuck out of here
the patients in the holding room
you want his blue cross number you go in and you get his blue cross number
cushing elbows back through the line of patients waiting at the admitting desk
do you mind please
there are now three nurses behind the desk all of them on phones
one nurse calls to dr
wants to know how that asthmatic they sent down is
just leaving the group around the junkie shes fine
wed like to keep her here a little while
spezio heads for the door where he is intercepted by mrs
may i see you a moment doctor if you dont mind
sighs calls back to the triage nurse ill be right back
he goes out followed by mrs
spezio and mrs
cushing move between laundry and supply carts
thrusting some papers at the doctor if you dont mind doctor is this your handwriting
spezio stops sighs examines the paper
am i supposed to read that
was it a sprain
was it a broken wrist
i cant read that scribbling
i mean i have to bill these people
i know you doctors are the ministering angels and im just the bitch from the accounting department but i have my job to do too
i mean if you dont mind doctor
studies the paper the kid had a collar fracture
we had him in the o
we reduced it and we gave him a small cast
he strides off
calls after him but did you give him a sling
you must have taken x rays
how am i supposed to make up the charges
she turns into
designed to hold patients whove been examined and wait to be admitted to a room upstairs its in fact used for examination treatment storage
the room is quiet
two male patients lie on comfortable stretchers apparently sedated and resting
cushing turns to the patient immediately to her right as she enters
to the still figure she poses her questions
are you mitgang
she gets no answer from that bed
from another direction a voice
she turns to mitgang
something bothers her about the first patient
she finds mitgangs chart tucked in under his pillow takes out her pencil
do you carry blue cross blue shield mr
mitgang if you dont mind
mitgang eyes closed emits a sound
do you have your card with you
no answer do you know your number
negative grunt from mitgang
mitgang youre not leaving this room until i have this information
enters for some chore will you leave that man alone
in a fit of temper mrs
cushing throws the chart and her pencil down on the floor
indicating the other patient do you mind if i at least ask this gentleman to fill out his chart
she pulls his chart from under his pillow bends and retrieves her pencil from the floor straightens
she speaks to the silent patient
may i have your a
policy number sir
camera moves slowly in on the patient
we now recognize him as the bespectacled young activist dr
ives so recently coshed over the head with a sandbag
looming do you carry blue cross
cushing stares at the patient
he is not breathing
behind her the nurse exits carrying whatever she came for
cushing turns to her but she is gone
cushing backs out
spezio and others come down the corridor
as spezio approaches with spiteful relish i think one of your patients in here is dead dr
enters the holding room why do you say that mrs
because he wouldnt give me his blue cross number dr
spezio regards the death mask of a face
he moves quickly forward to raise the dead mans eyelid
behind him a nurse enters
he wheels on her angrily
how the hell long has this man been lying here
isnt this that doctor who came in around nine oclock
milton mead late thirties lean efficient but under constant strain is having his daily staff luncheon conference which consists of a chief engineer the assistant administrator of personnel three residents
in administration including hitchcock sandwiches and coffee
i mean they gave me a hard time con ed
for petes sake i said this is a hospital
one of our feedlines just blew
meads phone rings and he picks it up
its another annoyance he sighs with irritation i mean its lucky we traced it in time
on phone no ill be right up
hangs up stands have we covered about everything
kish has been driving me nuts with the o
hes supposed to see me about that
he moves across his office into
actually a communal office with desks for three secretaries
looks up to mead from talking on the phone this is the emergency room
one of the doctors just died of a heart attack
pauses one of our staff
i think so
mead frowns leans back into his own office
to hitchcock tom you want to go down to the emergency room
one of our doctors just died
yeah see what thats about
en passant to secretary ill be on holly eight
ill be right back
the staff elevator door opens and milton mead comes out
he has apparently been buttonholed in the elevator by a woman in a doctors coat dr
immelman pathology who follows him out
its no longer pilferage milton
its reached the point of piracy
thats the third microscope this month
why dont we get together on this sometime this afternoon fran
one oclock will be fine
he turns left and heads for
where head nurse donovan is bent over her paperwork
in the background we see normal morning hospital activity
nurses aid sharlene stone takes towels into a room
felicia chile comes out of another bearing her enamel tray of instruments
also in the background the curious quartet from before the beautiful woman the elderly indian the minister dr
mead hardly notices them as he makes for the desk
without pausing or looking up your brothers in the room mr
what room is it
eight o six
mead bobs his head thank you and heads for the west corridor
as milton mead enters his elder brother william mead mid forties a smaller and manifestly nervous man is seated sullenly puffing a cigar fidgeting still wearing his coat and hat
he looks up briefly when milton enters and avoids his brothers eye
his wife marilyn late thirties is standing in suppressed exasperation staring out the window
out of respect for the comatose patient the ensuing agitated scene is held in whispers
for heavens sake willie youre going to be in the hospital for two lousy days
whatre you making such a fuss about
youre supposed to be such a big wheel here
there are no private rooms available
if they brought in jesus christ fresh off the cross i couldnt get him a private room
im not going to stay in a room with a dying man
hes not dying
theyll screen him off
you wont even know hes here
if you want a private room go on home and ill call you the first one that comes up
but youre the one who phoned me in a panic youre going on a vacation
for heavens sake willie theyll cut this polyp out tomorrow morning
youll be home thursday youll be in miami friday
marilyn will you talk some sense into this lunatic
well you said it hes a lunatic
big wheel cant even get me a private room
ill get you a tranquilizer
bock excited vivid alive is in full flush with his lecture
he moves around in front of the blackboard chalk in hand
the blackboard itself is scrawled with formulae and diagrams
he is writing the words full abdomen as the fifth in a list reading parexia hepatomegaly splenomegaly episodes of arthralgia
the audience is forty young doctors rapt with attention
there is a good deal of note taking
five a full abdomen contrasted to wasting elsewhere six ascites with a protein content above four grams unexplained anemia leukopenia unexplained elevation of the serum gamma globulin level especially abnormal
flocculation tests and of course a positive p
all these findings assume special significance among negroes
this has been a very commendable workup as commendable a workup of an f
as i can remember
the staff of this floor is to be applauded
spots brubaker among the others its a reportable case brubaker
write it up
a brief rare smile well lets go have a look at the girl
he rumbles toward the door
the class of doctors dissolves into hospital murmurs and mutters and a general dispersal
they follow bock out to
sutfcliffe the beautiful young woman the elderly indian and the minister are engaged in agitated discussion
the girl and the indian retain their stoic impassivity
sutcliffe leaves them and moves down the corridor to the counter of
nurse whos the senior resident on this floor
that would be dr
but im afraid hes at chief of service rounds right now
sutcliffe points off right
the nurse nods indifferently
across to bock coming out of the tv room followed by some dozen young doctors
bock is in very good spirits indeed
he quizzes his young doctors en route i wonder if there might not be some correlation between hepatic tuberculosis and drug addiction
presumably there was an early consideration of s
off screen yes sir
we discounted it after repeated blood cultures were negative
is that right ambler
what else do you look for in bacterial endocarditis
nervous some sort of embolic phenomena sir
flagging brubaker dr
brubaker i wonder if i could see you for a moment
brubaker detaches himself from his group to join sutcliffe
camera stays with bock and his entourage following them down the east corridor bock still happily conducting class
bock strides into
past two beds they group around the foot of a third bed on the right side of the room
bock checks the patient lying in the bed
still a little icteric
whos got an opthalmoscope
one of the young men hands his to bock who leans over the patient to look through it
did anyone note roth spots
the doctors exchange a look as bock rises moves toward them laughing
well dont worry about it
there arent any
ambler youre our big man on s
what was the latex fixation
it wasnt done sir
dont you think thats an important test to differentiate s
from miliary t
off screen no s
not you biegelman
well theres about a seventy percent incidence of false positive latex in bock hands the opthalmoscope to ambler
you have been reading up
if the diagnosis were s
would a positive latex indicate anything in the therapy
wed expect the latex to become negative
if the antibiotic therapy were successful
are you applying for your internship here
im not sure
come and see me
to the patient helping her up would you sit up for a minute
bock turns to the off screen patient helping her sit up and forward percussing her back as the students look on
brubaker and sutcliffe are now both involved in discussion with the woman the indian and the minister as bock drifts through the background followed by the band of young doctors
bock crosses past the foreground group to the staff elevator
he pushes the button
brubaker approaches bock
they confer quietly in the hallway
weve got a little thing over here doctor
the girl over there is the daughter of the patient in eight o six
he is at the moment comatose and requires intravenous feeding and meds
the elevator comes and goes disgorging some taking on others
bock who greeted brubaker with a rare benign smile has begun to look a bit sodden
poor brubaker aware of the gathering storm in bocks demeanor sighs and continues regardless
the thing is the daughter wants to take the father out of the hospital and back to mexico where they live
the patients name is drummond
hes apparently a methodist missionary and he and his daughter run some kind of religious mission among the apache indians
the daughter claims to be a licensed nurse so she can give the necessary i
i certainly dont think he should be let out of this hospital
the attending hes the guy in gray over there concurs
bock squints at brubaker
all right wait a minute
let me have all that again
as a matter of fact doctor this is dr
never mind the professional ethics what happened
sighs i dont know why im covering for that sonofabitch in farkis pavilion anyway
sighs and begins the patient a man of fifty six was admitted to the hospital ten days ago for a check up in good health no visible distress
we did the mandatory work up on him
blood cultures stool l
preps chest e
but there was apparently some evidence of protein in his urine
i dont know how that sonofabitch in farkis pavilion ever found out about it
maybe he had some kind of deal with one of the girls in the lab
anyway he turned up the next day conned the patient into signing an authorization for a biopsy
what sonofabitch in farkis pavilion
some post grad fellow named ives
i never met him
hes on one of the immunology research programs
are you trying to tell me some post grad fellow came up here and did a biopsy on the patient
he conned biegelman with that old story about
protein in the urine
and he biopsied the man
and he nicked a vessel and at two oclock in the morning they woke up biegelman because the nurse found the patient in shock
biegelman called the kidney people for a consult right away
what was there to see
the man was sour and bleeding
we spoke to this fellow sutcliffe and he referred us to a surgeon named welbeck
you aint heard nothing yet
so we finally got welbeck around four in the morning
he said go ahead
so they laid on the surgery for eight
welbeck turns up half stoned orders an i
clears him for allergies
without actually testing
and the patient went into shock
and tubular necrosis
they lopped out the bleeding kidney ran him back to the room and we sat around waiting for three days to see how obstructed he was
fever began spiking like hell euremia vomiting so we arranged hemodialysis
hes putting out good water now
but some nurse goofed on his last treatment
a leak in the tube something
his blood pressure plunged
they ran him right up to i
checked out vital signs all normal except hes comatose
that was two days ago
in short a man came into this hospital in perfectly good health and in the space of one week we chopped out one kidney damaged the other reduced him to
coma and damn near killed him
a great sad serenity has settled over bock
you know brubaker last night i sat in my hotel room reviewing the shambles of my life and contemplating suicide
then i said no bock dont do it
youre a doctor a healer
youre the chief of medicine at one of the great hospitals of the world
youre a necessary person
your life is meaningful
then i came in this morning and find out one of my doctors was killed by a couple of nurses who mistook him for a patient because he screwed a
technician from the nephrology lab
and now you come to me with this gothic horror story in which the entire machinery of modern medicine has apparently conspired to destroy one lousy patient
how am i to sustain my feeling of meaningfulness in the face of this
you know brubaker if there was an oven around id stick my head in it
what was the name of that sonofabitch from farkis pavilion again
somebody ought to ream his ass
the gathering storm erupts
rage suffuses bocks face
out of respect for the hospital corridor and the people working around him and brubaker he keeps it glacial
but there is no mistaking the volcanic fury he feels
barely containing himself im going to ream his ass
and im going to break that barber welbecks back
im going to defrock those two cannibals
they wont practice in my hospital ill tell you that
whatll i tell the girl sir
she says we have no legal right to stop her from taking her father out
shes willing to sign an a
let him go
before we kill him
the elevator door opens
a couple of nurses come out
bock strides in
bock advances in a cold fury down to his office
he wrenches the door open
miss lebow and miss mcguire clatter away at typewriters
sitting on a chair in the crowded office is a senior staff doctor a man in his late forties wearing a coat similar to bocks
he is dr
he looks up from the magazine hes been leafing through as bock storms in
bock acknowledges him with a brusque nod storms over to miss lebow
get me dr
put him on page if you have to
i want to talk to him right now
i dont care if hes operating
wheels around to miss mcguire and you get me some monkey named ives
i v e s first name elroy
hes in the farkis pavilion
i want to talk to you joe
would you mind coming into my office
he strides followed by dr
and slams the door shut behind him
have you got some punk named ives rotating in your department
sits at his desk i also want to know what the hell kind of a dialysis room youre running
i just came from
the phone rings
bock seizes it
put him on
didnt you tell me a couple of months ago you were going to cut off all privileges for that assassin welbeck
he just butchered another one of my patients
oh come on harry
the mans a buccaneer
i want him brought before the medical executive committee
hes in your department harry not mine
hes putatively a surgeon
ill be here
slams receiver down stares at lagerman listen joe i think you should know that youve got a research guy in your department named ives whos been doing some very dubious
were having enough trouble squeezing grants out of the nixon administration
ives is dead herb
thats why im here
this gives bock pause
he blinks at lagerman
what do you mean ives is dead
i mean hes dead
he had a heart attack in the emergency room
he had a heart attack in the emergency room
blinking what the hell is this
some kind of plague
stands where is he now
they were just taking him down to pathology
bock lagerman and hitchcock have gathered across the shrouded figure of dr
ives on a stretcher
we are in the lab section of pathology in the background through the glass part of the door separating the lab from the surgery room we can see the autopsy
schaefer being performed
schaefers naked white cadaver is stretched out on an operating table
he has been opened up and all his vital organs are being excised
the autopsy is being performed by dr
brewster the resident in pathology dressed in surgical scrub
and the next thing anybody knew about three hours later mrs
cushing from accounting came in and said there was a dead man in the holding room
you dont find anything grotesque about all this
what do you mean
i mean at half past eight this morning we meet over a doctor whos been killed intravenously and here we are again four hours later with another doctor who had
a heart attack in the emergency room
well whatre you suggesting doctor
do you think we have a mad killer stalking the halls of the hospital
ives died of a heart attack and schaefer in a diabetic coma
people do die of these things
its all perhaps coincidental but i dont think id call it grotesque
how long are they going to be on schaefers post
he knocks on the glass window of the door separating the laboratory from the operating room
brewster turns from his gory chore
bock makes a gesture saying how much longer
brewster raises ten blood drenched rubber gloved fingers
bock turns and shuffles across the lab for the door out
pauses at door to lagerman i dont suppose youd like to call next of kin
deeply depressed oh god i need a drink
he goes down
and is soon lost in the normal traffic of the area
crash of thunder
crackle of lightning
a horror film rainstorm lashes the vast dark complex of buildings
dark empty silent
one lonely light at the lobby end of the long closed corridor of offices
the door to bocks office stands ajar and issues a trace of light
across the silent dark typewriter covered desks of the two secretaries through the doorway to bocks private office we can see bock at his desk lit by the desk lamp
he has a bottle of booze on his desk
he gets up from his desk
he has made a decision
the corridors are silent the night lights are on subdued
head evening nurse mrs
dunne is back at her desk hunched over paperwork
resident brubaker passes by
nurse sherlee devine a black woman in her mid twenties has a porcelain tray on the shelf onto which she puts a small jar of alcohol cotton swabs a wrapped
hypodermic needle and syringe
she moves out into
dunne looks up as she passes
nurse devine makes her way silently down the sleeping doors to
the bathroom light is on but only a thin stream of yellow light trickles through the door
william mead sleeps fitfully
the other patient is entirely curtained off
nurse devine sets her tray on meads bedtable turns on the goose neck lamp keeping it from his eyes
she unwraps the hypodermic syringe sets in the needle draws the required dosage reaches over and gently shakes mead by the shoulder
mead i have an injection for you
mead sleeps on
expressionlessly nurse devine extracts meads right arm from under the sheets wets a swab with alcohol and rubs down the vein
the needle slides into meads vein
over this we begin to hear a distant sibilant hissing indistinct like the leakage of a bad heart
there is also an occasional distinctly human but not quite civilized sound
camera pulls back slowly to nurse devine withdrawing the needle looking up for she too has heard the soft strange sounds
they emanate from behind the curtains of the other bed
nurse devine returns the syringe to the tray gathers her things and pads silently around meads bed to drummonds bed
with her free hand she opens the curtains a little and stares in
what the hell is going on in there
the old indian has stripped to the waist and marked his body with smears of dye and tule pollen
he wears a ceremonial hat a sort of beaded beanie
he holds a small buckskin bag of pollen in his cupped palms and is facing north east south and west offering the bag and prayers under his breath as he
a beaded amulet lies stretched across the white sheet covering the comatose drummond
when nurse devine draws the curtains barbara frowns at nurse devine holds a cautioning finger to her lips and draws the curtains closed again
nurse devine carrying her porcelain tray exits
bock comes out of the elevator jacketed now fairly drunk but holding it well
he heads for the nurses station as nurse devine comes down the west corridor
bock grunts at mrs
dunne and goes into
where he quickly runs his finger along the second shelf until he comes to the bottle of potassium which he filches off the shelf and slips into his pocket
he rummages through the drawers for a hypodermic syringe
through the open doorway we see nurse devine making her way swiftly up to mrs
dunne at the desk
well honey we got a witch doctor in eight o six and you better go in there
you know that indian that was sitting in eight o six all night
hes still there and the girls there and theyre doing some voodoo in there and i aint kidding
dunne bock appears in the doorway to the pharmacy where he stands listening
looking up what are you talking about
i mean that indians in there half naked and going pis pis pis with a little bag
you just better get in there mrs
dunne annoyed gets up and heads for the west corridor followed by nurse devine and by an intrigued dr
bock at a few paces behind
to nurse weitzenbaum coming out of another room you want to see somethin baby
you jus come here
as the small procession bears down barbara drummond slips out of that room to intercept them
keeping her voice low look its a perfectly harmless ceremony nothing to get excited about
itll be over in a few minutes anyway
blacktree is a shaman who gets his power from the thunder and its imperative he conclude his rituals while the storm is still going on
visiting hours were over at nine oclock miss
bock reaches for the door to the room
all thats going on in there doctor is a simple apache prayer for my fathers recovery
bock makes a vague noise neither contradicting her nor assenting and continues around her into
as bock slides in a bit of the corridor light comes in with him
the curtains have been left sufficiently open to reveal mr
he is still stripped to the waist and marked with crosses of pollen
he extends two twigs to the four directions after which he places the twigs carefully on the white sheet covering drummond in a pattern around the amulet already there
behind bock mrs
dunne can be seen peeking in
the indian is oblivious to both of them
bock watches it all with interest for a moment and then backs out into
closing the door after him
the markings hes made on my fathers arms are from the pollen of the tule plant
the twigs have no significance other than theyve been struck by lightning and are consequently appeals to the spirit of lightning
its all entirely harmless a religious ceremony not a medical one
you dont seriously believe all that mumbo jumbo will cure him
on the other hand it wont kill him doctor
they regard each other levelly
he wheels and clumps off for the stairway exit
nurse weitzenbaum opens the door of the room and peeks in
at the stairway exit bock pauses to look back at all the women in front of room
miss drummond are you still taking your father out
i still have to arrange an ambulance service
is there a phone around i could use
use my office
barbara edges past weitzenbaum who is still peeking into the room
barbara comes in gathers her coat and purse from a chair and moves to the indian now occupied with what seems to be the rolling of a cigarette
the two exchange a brief dialogue in apache
the old indian nods
barbara turns and exits taking nurse weitzenbaum out with her and closing the door
the room is dark and hushed again
blacktree lights his cigarette and sends the smoke up a ritual which consists of puffing smoke to each of the four directions muttering in apache may all be well after
camera slowly pans to the other bed where william mead sleeps fitfully
the apache words and pis pis pis penetrate meads drugged sleep
he opens one eyelid and stares glazedly at the dark air
the sounds persist
blacktree chooses this moment to sidle out from behind the curtains and continue his ritual in the less confined space at the head of drummonds bed
its quite a sight for a nervous sedated man to wake to
thunder rumbles and the rain slashes and a sudden savage streak of lightning illuminates it all
mead figures its all a bad dream and after a moment of dully regarding the odd spectacle closes his one eye and goes back to sleep
barbara drummond comes in
bock has apparently turned the lights on for her but bock himself is not immediately visible
she looks through the half open door to bocks private office and there he is staring blankly at the bottle
barbara starts to say something thinks better of it lays down her coat and looking around spots a manhattan classified directory which she hauls up from its shelf and sets
on miss lebows desk
she sits quickly flips through the pages
barbara flips through the directory
bock is partially visible in the background at his desk
he sits soddenly
barbara finds what she wants opens her purse and takes out two airplane tickets
the clicking of the dial catches bocks ear
he looks up for a moment
on phone hello
id like to arrange an ambulance for one thirty tomorrow afternoon
reverse across bock at his desk with barbara partially visible at miss lebows desk
all he can see are her great long tanned legs
in background on phone drummond first name barbara
ill pay cash
bock stands a little unsteadily and moves around his desk to get a better look at those legs
on phone no youre to pick up my father drummond edward at the manhattan medical center holly pavilion room eight o six
its a stretcher case
i presume you provide the stretcher
she senses bock watching her turns smiles
shes a very beautiful girl
she returns to the phone
hes to be taken to american airlines yes
kennedy airport flight seven two nine to yuma arizona
ill accompany the patient
yes thank you
she returns the receiver to its cradle
when she looks up again bock is no longer there
she returns the flight tickets to her purse snaps it shut stands and moves to the doorway enters a step into
bock back at his desk looks up
you believe in witchcraft miss drummond
i believe in everything doctor
like a drink
bock drains his glass and pours her a hefty shot of bourbon
from the door suddenly my father you should know was a very successful doctor in boston a member of the harvard medical faculty
he was a widower and i was his only child
he was not an especially religious man a sober methodist
one evening seven years ago he attended a pentecostal meeting in the commons rooms at harvard and suddenly found himself speaking in tongues
she takes her drink and crosses to the sofa that is to say he suddenly sank to his knees at the back of the room and began to talk fluently
in a language which no one had ever heard before
this sort of thing happens frequently at pentecostal meetings and they began to happen regularly to my father
she sits it was not unusual to walk into our home and find my father sitting in his office utterly serene and happily speaking to the air in this strange
i was at that time twenty years old and having my obligatory affair with a minority group in my case a hopi indian a post graduate fellow at harvard doing
his doctorate in the aboriginal languages of the southwest
one day i brought the indian boy home just as my father was sinking to his knees in the entrance foyer in one of his trances
the indian wheeled in his tracks and said well ill be a sonofabitch
you see my father was speaking an apache dialect an obscure dialect at that spoken only by a ragged band of unreconstructed indians who had rejected the reservation and were
living in total isolation in the sierra madre mountains of northern mexico
what do you say to that dr
who has been staring at her as if she were insane what the hell am i supposed to say to that miss drummond
barbara throws back her head and roars with laughter
im sitting here boozing and all of a sudden you start telling me some demented story about your fathers religious conversion
no no you miss the point doctor
not my fathers conversion mine
you see i had been hitting the acid pretty regularly at that time
i had achieved a few minor sensory deformities some suicidal despairs but nothing as wild as fluency in an obscure apache dialect
i mean like wow man
i mean here was living afflatus right before my eyes
within a week my father had closed his beacon hill practice and set out to start a mission in the mexican mountains
and i turned in my s
card and my crash helmet and followed him
it was a disaster at least for me
my father had received the revelation not i
he stood gaunt on a mountain slope and preached the apocalypse to solemnly amused indians
i masturbated a great deal
we lived in a grass wickiup and ate raw rabbit and crushed pinon nuts
it was hideous
within two months i was back in boston a hollow shell and dizzy with dengue disenchanted with everything
i turned to austerity combed my hair tight and entered nursing school
i became haggard driven and had shamelessly incestuous dreams about my father
i took up with some of the senior staff at the hospital
one of them a portly psychiatrist explained i was generated by an unresolved lust for my father
i apparently cracked up
one day they found me walking to work naked and screaming obscenities
there was talk of institutionalizing me so i packed a bag and went back to my father in the sierra madre mountains
ive been there ever since
thats three years
my father is of course mad as a hatter
i watch over him and have been curiously content
you see doctor i believe in everything
she pauses her story over
throughout bock has been trying to keep his glowering eye on the desktop
during her long narrative he once seized the bottle and took a swig
mostly he is finding the experience murkily sensual
his glance keeps darting out from under his brows to surreptitiously look at the beautiful long tanned legs or when she bends for the drink she set on the floor
to peer down the flapping open scalloped neck of her dress she is bra less
she on the other hand has been crossing and uncrossing her legs bending stretching so that her short dress has ridden up almost to her waist and is saved from
utter exhibitionism only by the darkness of the shadows
she seems unaffected by bocks voyeuristic interest in her but she is surely not unaware of it
it is hard to believe she is not courting his attention
now what was that all about miss drummond
i thought i was obvious as hell
im trying to tell you i have a thing for middle aged men
i admire your candor
youve been admiring a lot more than that
bock looks up and they suddenly find their eyes locked
the dark dense air in the room fairly steams with incipient sexuality
looks down again youre wasting your time
ive been impotent for years
with a crash of his fist on the desktop bock stands he is in a drunken rage
lurches about what the hells wrong with being impotent
my god you kids are more hung up on sex than the victorians
ive got a son twenty three
i threw him out of the house last year
pietistic little humbug
he preached universal love and despised everyone
he had a blanket contempt for the middle class even its decencies
he detested my mother because she had petit bourgeois pride in her son the doctor
i cannot tell you how brutishly he ignored that rather good old lady
when she died he didnt even come to the funeral
he thought the chapel service an hypocrisy
his generation didnt live with lies he told me
everybody lives with lies i said
i grabbed him by his poncho dragged him the full length of our seven room despicably affluent middle class apartment and flung him out
i havent seen him since
but do you know what he said to me as he stood there on that landing on the verge of tears
he shrieked at me you old fink
you cant even get it up anymore
that was it you see
that was his real revolution
it wasnt racism and the oppressed poor and the war in vietnam
the ultimate american societal sickness was a limp dingus
he lurches about laughing rustily my god if there is a despised and misunderstood minority in this country its us poor impotent bastards
well im impotent and proud of it
impotence is beautiful baby
he raises a militant fist power to the impotent
right on baby
smiling right on
stares drunkenly at her when i say impotent i dont mean merely limp
disagreeable as it may be for a woman a man may sometimes lust for other things something less transient than an erection some sense of permanent worth
thats what medicine was for me my reason for being
when i was thirty four miss drummond i presented a paper before the annual convention of the society of clinical investigation that pioneered the whole goddam field of immunology
im in all the textbooks
i happen to be an eminent man miss drummond
and you want to know something miss drummond
i dont give a goddam
when i say im impotent i mean ive lost even my desire for work which is a hell of a lot more primal a passion than sex
ive lost my raison detre my purpose the only thing i ever truly loved
its all rubbish anyway
transplants antibodies we manufacture genes we can produce birth ectogenetically we can practically clone people like carrots and half the kids in this ghetto havent even been inoculated for polio
we have assembled the most enormous medical establishment ever conceived and people are sicker than ever
we cure nothing
we heal nothing
the whole goddam wretched world is strangulating in front of our eyes
thats what i mean when i say impotent
you dont know what the hell im talking about do you
of course i do
im tired im terribly tired miss drummond
and i hurt and ive got nothing going for me anymore
can you understand that
yes of course
then can you understand that the only admissable matter left is death
he suspects he is going to cry and turns quickly away
he sits heavily and fights his tears
sounds to me like a familiar case of morbid menopause
well its hard for me to take your despair very seriously doctor
you obviously enjoy it so much
oh bugger off
thats all i need now clinical insights
some cockamamie twenty five year old
acidheads going to reassure me about menopause now
look id like to be alone so why dont you beat it
close the door and turn off the lights on your way out
they are both suddenly conscious of a third presence in the room
they look to the door where mr
blacktree fully clothed again and carrying his coat is standing in the doorway
barbara uncrosses her long legs and stands
crossing to the door mr
blacktree disapproves of my miniskirt but it was the only thing i had to come to the city with
back at the tribe i wear ankle length buckskin
just close the door and turn off the lights
barbara regards his hunched form and murmuring in apache she exits closing the door
in the subsequent hush thunder rumbles and crashes
wind sweeps the rain against the window panes
the sounds go unheeded by bock still as marble
slowly he raises his head and sighs and then fishes about in his jacket pockets to bring out the bottle of potassium and syringe
he takes off his jacket rolling up his shirtsleeve poking about for the vein
he removes his trouser belt which he ties tightly about his upper arm for a tourniquet
now he tears the wrapping of the syringe and fits the needle to it
fiddling about in the pockets of his jacket he finally finds a crumpled pack of cigarettes
he lights one and returns to the business of killing himself puffing expressionlessly as he does
thunder rumbles and rain slashes
he carefully draws just the right amount of potassium from the bottle to the syringe peering at the procedure against the light of his desk lamp
he sets the cigarette on the ashtray switches the hypodermic to his right hand holds his left arm rigidly out under the light of the lamp
off screen whatre you shooting doc
he turns slowly to the doorway his bare left arm still rigidly extended the belt dangling the hypodermic clenched in his other hand
barbara is perfectly framed in the doorway
he stares at her slowly suffusing with the numb blind total rage of the aborted suicide
the thunder crashes
barely gets the words out leave me alone
she approaches the desk affably turns the potassium around to read the label
you take enough of this stuff itll kill you doc
moves toward the couch it occurred to me that i might have read you wrong that you really were suicidal
so i came back
bocks rage erupts
he crashes the hypodermic syringe down shattering it
the potassium puddles on the wood
hysterical rage who the hell asked you
he moves around the desk a shambling bear of a man a leather belt dangling dementedly from his arm tears coursing down his cheeks
he advances on her in a stuperous shuffle
who the hell asked you
she regards his lumbering approach with a faint grotesquely sensual smile
he reaches with his naked left arm to the neck of her dress and with one savage wrench rips her stark naked sobbing through hysterical tears
leave me alone
why the hell dont you leave me alone
he is on her crushing her down into the shadows of the couch ravenous at her neck and shoulders in a brutish assault sobbing
why didnt you let me do it
who the hell asked you
throughout the scene camera moves slowly in through the flesh and fury to an intense two shot of this terrified act of love
then slowly over bocks plunging shoulder to the womans face
she gasps at the moment of penetration then her lovely face slowly shapes into smiling serenity
bock sobs even in the shadows we can see the path of the tears on his cheek
the quiet black streets glisten wetly in the puddles of lamplight
the night shift is finishing up
theresa campanella r
a high strung girl in her early twenties stands at a water tap holding a glass and popping some pills in her mouth
to the room well ill see you
campanella comes out of the dialysis room puts on her coat and walks to
campanella moves down the empty corridor
all the doors are closed now only the overhead light in the background of the corridor glows weakly
campanella puts a cigarette in her mouth pauses to look for matches she hasnt any
scowling with annoyance she continues to the lobby and stops by a partially visible white jacketed figure reading a newspaper
do you have a match doctor
she takes the matches lights her cigarette inhaling deeply when he suddenly sandbags her from behind
she goes down
covered by bocks overcoat barbara tosses and turns on the couch in a small nightmare
through the windows comes the first gray wash of dawn
full shot of barbara awake and up on one elbow on the verge of a scream
she looks around the room
it is dark empty silent
across barbara looking through the door to the secretarial office
it is likewise dark but suddenly the lights go on and a moment later bock enters
he holds a container of coffee in each hand and has something white draped over his forearm
from under bocks bulky coat barbara watches him lumber to his desk where he sets the containers of coffee down
he drops the whitish garment over the back of a chair and then sits
he hoists a bulging folder of correspondence from his filing tray and hunches to work reading
after a moment he regards the silent figure on the couch across the room
you wouldnt be awake
what time is it
he rises picks up the second container and white dress from the chair
she reaches out an arm for the coffee
bock holds up a nurses uniform
i swiped this for you out of the nurses locker room
ill make good on your dress
im afraid its torn beyond repair
buy yourself a new one or if you like give me your size and ill send it on to you
but i want to talk to you about that
talk to me about what
about your father
you really shouldnt move him in his condition
i just had a look at his chart
theres no reason to presume brain damage
you know as well as i you cant predict anything in these instances
he could pull out of that coma at any time
i think you should let him stay here
ill personally look after him
he has perched on the edge of the couch and she rests her cheek against the long bent curve of his back smiling
is this your way of saying youd like me to stay in town a few more days
he turns to look at her smiles back
well that would be nice too
she sips her coffee
what do you say miss drummond
i expect you can call me barbara considering you ravished me three times last night
oh look at him pretending he didnt count
you were as puffed up as a toad about it
punched a couple of holes in your crusade for universal impotence didnt it
i think were on a first name basis by now
ill call you herb
lets give your father a week barbara what do you say
a frown darkens her face no i dont want my father in this hospital
i had a dream about this hospital
some of the terror shows on her face i dreamt this enormous starched white tile building suddenly erupted like a volcano and all the patients doctors nurses attendants orderlies the
whole line staff the food service people the aged the lame and you right in the middle were stampeding in one hideous screaming suicidal mass into the sea
she stares at him wide eyed reliving the dream im taking my father out of here and as quickly as i can
they stare at each other she in terror he with affection
youre a real fruitcake you know
she sets her coffee down on the couch and decides to wear bocks overcoat rather than use it as a cover
she searches for the sleeves
bock assists her
well let me put it this way
i love you
i fancied you from the first moment you came lumbering down that hallway upstairs
i said to mr
blacktree whos that hulking bear of a man
the apaches are reverential about bears
they wont eat bear meat they never skin bears
bear is thought of as both benign and evil but very strong power
men with bear power are highly respected and are frequently said to be great healers
by now shes standing the overcoat reaching her toes
she looks down at bock perched on the couch
i said to mr
blacktree that man gets his power from the bear
now look do you have a hotel some sort of accommodations where you can stay for a week or so
barbara reaches for her coffee sips moves around in her tent of a coat
all right let me put it this way herb
my father and i accept the implacability of death
if he dies he dies but im taking him out of here and back to mexico about one oclock this afternoon
i want you to come with us because i love you and want children
im afraid mexico sounds a little too remote for me
we could use you down there you know
theres a curiously high incidence of t
and youd be a doctor again herb
youd be necessary again
if you love me i dont see what other choice you have
what do you mean if i love you
i raped you in a suicidal rage
how did we get to love and children all of a sudden
oh for heavens sake herb i ought to know if a man loves me or not
you must have told me half a hundred times last night you loved me
you murmured it shouted it one time you opened the window and bellowed it out into the street
i think those were more expressions of gratitude than love
gratitude for what
well my god for resurrecting feelings of life in me i thought dead
well my god what do you think love is
okay i love you and you love me
im not about to argue with so relentless a romantic
well then since we have this great passion going for us i dont see why you wont stay on here in new york for a week or ten days
its up to ten days now
as long as it takes for your fathers condition to improve
ive had these prophetic dreams for seven nights
seven is a sinister number
the meaning of these dreams is very clear seven times as clear
i am to get my father and you out of this hospital before we are all destroyed
throws up his hands youre certifiable
my god half the time youre a perfectly intelligent young woman and then suddenly you turn into a goddam cabalist who believes in dreams witchcraft and bear power
and i dont like the way you dismiss my whole life as unnecessary
i do a lot of healing right here in manhattan
i dont have to go to mexico for it
i also teach
i send out eighty doctors a year into the world sometimes inspirited at least competent
ive built up one of the best damned departments of medicine in the world
weve got a hell of a heart unit here and a hell of a kidney group
a lot of people come into this hospital in big trouble miss drummond and go out better for the experience
so dont tell me how unnecessary i am
whos been slipping into the nurses uniform yeah
so how come eight hours ago you were trying to kill yourself with an overdose of potassium
where are you going now
this last in reference to barbara crossing to the secretaries office zippering her uniform
gathering her coat and purse my hotel
i have to check out
blacktree doesnt speak any english
from the connecting doorway well youre coming back of course
i have to settle the bill here and pack my father
and i think you need a few hours alone to make your decisions
youre a very tired and very damaged man
youve had a hideous marriage and i assume a few tacky affairs along the way
youre understandably reluctant to get involved again
and on top of that here i am with the preposterous idea you throw everything up and go off with me to some barren mountains of mexico
it sounds utterly mad i know
on the other hand you obviously find this world as desolate as i do
you did try to kill yourself last night
so thats it herb
either me and the mountains or the bottle of potassium
ill be back in an hour or so
ill be in my fathers room
she slips into her coat and exits as bock looks after her thoughtfully then turns back to his own office
he shuffles around distractedly not knowing how to articulate the exuberance he feels
suddenly he opens the window leans out and bellows to the empty air
i love you
softly my god
a construction sign fills the screen
it reads on this
suddenly the sign comes crashing down into camera
it has been wrenched off the wooden fence protecting the row of tenements and brownstones being demolished
about a dozen young and loud militants have torn it down
camera pans to show the row of houses behind the fence two of which have already been reduced to rubble the others have been boarded up
the demolition generators and cranes are parked silently along the curb
in the dark of a
three black families carrying children and children carrying household effects mattresses pots pans bags of groceries etc
are repossessing the condemned buildings
strong sun overhead
the street has been roped off and police are all over the place
a sparse crowd of a hundred or so throng the sidestreets off first avenue
signs read people si doctors no
a channel mobile news crew newspaper photographers and a radio newscaster are recording the situation with desultory interest
a police captain stands in the middle of the cordoned street bullhorning the occupiers of the condemned brownstones who can be seen through the broken windows
im asking you to come out peacefully
these buildings are condemned and unfit for habitation
a piece of brick arches down from the roof of a building and cracks the street a few feet from the captain
sighs tries again you people are possessing this building illegally and in violation of the law
im asking you to come out peacefully
a small press conference is going on in a corner of the lobby
reporters cluster and tv cameras surround the press representative of the hospital a young woman in her thirties named evelyn bassey who is trying to read a statement squinting under
her mod glasses at the blaze of lights set up by the camera crews
reading complete sympathy with the tenants
so the hospital has assumed the responsibility of finding housing units in good buildings
the hospital wishes to point out that this particular row of buildings on first avenue was condemned by the city before the hospital acquired ownership and even then only after
responsible leaders in the community had approved the building of our new drug rehabilitation center
explodes on the phone goddammit barry ive got a dozen community leaders waiting for me in the library
weve been trying to work out some kind of negotiable formula for two years
and with no help from you people in the urban affairs division i might add
welbeck appears in the doorway
hes in his fifties gray distinguished and very tanned with terribly terribly kindly old country doctor eyes
he wears a camel hair topcoat
he smiles benignly and twinkles at sundstrom from one of the leather chairs across the desk from the director
hardly notices welbeck and im not going to throw all that down the drain because some cockamamie activist group is show boating for the television cameras
you get those people out of those buildings before a wall collapses or a fire breaks out and weve got a riot on our hands
he hangs up sighs turns to the man across the desk
smiles twinkles having your troubles eh
well i wont take much of your time
my names welbeck
ive been associated with this hospital for six years and yesterday afternoon dr
gilley called me to say he was cutting off my privileges at the hospital
do you know anything about it
glances at his watch its news to me
he said he sent the report on
ill probably get it tomorrow
report on what
well im not sure myself
i did a nephrectomy on a man about seven days ago
emergency called in at four in the morning
the man was hemorrhaging hed gone sour
welbeck im terribly sorry but i do have this meeting
crosses to the door in any event theres nothing i can do about it
if gilley wants to cut your privileges hes chief of surgery its within his province
youll have to have the hearing
he exits followed by welbeck into the
i have a laparotomy laid on for this morning
i assume ill be allowed to go through with that
huffing a little ive been associated with this hospital for six years
now now welbeck
it seems to me ive had your name down here before for something
to his secretary en passant ill be in the staff room
he and welbeck pass out into the
flowing with a normal stream of traffic sundstrom and welbeck turn right and head down to the last room of the corridor
something comes to him and sundstrom pauses
wait a minute
youre the fellow with the medicaid collecting business who incorporated and went public right
i mean something like that
milton mead was telling me about you just the other day
youre a whole medical conglomerate
youve got a factoring service a computerized billing company and a few proprietary hospitals a few nursing homes
good heavens welbeck you shouldnt be brought up before a committee of mere doctors
you should be investigated by the securities and exchange commission
youll have to go through with the hearing welbeck
i dont interfere in these things
he opens the door of the staff room and strides in
even before he enters we get a blast of angry voices both male and female
for the moment the door is ajar we see a harried milton mead being assailed by angry blacks and puerto ricans and young white activist doctors
all overlapping no goddam halfway house no way baby
we aint gonna wait til to deal with this problem
we want to kill the drug thing right now
imperializing the blackaporican community and we reject the bourgie ass middle class black traitors and flunkies who are selling out the blackaporican proletariat masses to the expansionist racist policies of
this shit hospital
lets get back to the abortion issue
sit down woman
what the hell does the male establishment know about abortions
theres an agitated reaction in the crowd
who the hell raised the issue of birth control
the issue at hand is the control of drug addiction in this community and in the ghetto generally
a black man jumps up and points off right
we dont want no goddam abortion
a white doctor jumps in from the left
lets get down to the core of this matter
a che guevara styled revolutionary moves toward mead and sundstrom at the table
the point is that this hospital is the landlord for those buildings and they shouldve turned them down
angrily he leans over the table facing sundstrom
those buildings are imperialistic extensions of the medical establishment
this hospital ought to be rebuilding those tenements give those people decent housing
sundstrom raises his hands for quiet and starts to rise
the hostile din has gotten to him
please please please
william mead is transferred from his bed to a rolling stretcher by an orderly in shirt and trousers and by nurse felicia chile
nurse chile tucks mead in
he opens his eyes to look at her drowsily
under sedation you know i hallucinated last night
i hallucinated there was an indian doing a war dance in here
affably you werent hallucinating mr
there was an indian in here last night
staring through his sedation at her there was
they wheel him out into
mead is wheeled down the corridor by the orderly
at the far end an anesthetized patient blue in the harsh light fresh from surgery is being wheeled into a recovery room
surgery is busy and efficient but not as clinically tidy as wed like
linens and equipment and surgical gear are piled into corners or on empty stretchers
green uniformed nurses doctors and orderlies go in and out of the many doors flanking the corridor
this is the non sterilized area where doctors and nurses confer in the corridors three black orderlies await an assignment sit on stretchers chuckle mutter
phones can be heard ringing
the orderly wheeling mead turns left into the
a small cluttered central area with the office of the operating room nursing supervisor on the right and the holding for anesthesia room on the left
is like the emergency ward desperately busy but staffed by people grown so accustomed to it that they display a calm almost casual but febrile efficiency
a large blackboard faces the supervisors office with the days schedule of operations neatly chalked in
it is full
a middle aged surgeon still in his overcoat is studying the schedule
a green uniformed nurse swings through the glass doors from the operating room area to lean into the supervisors office
norris says about half an hour
tell shirley it was just an ovarian cyst
the third nurse leans back into the supervisors office to relay this information
shirley it was just an ovarian cyst
this is apparently good news for we hear someone saying off screen oh thank god
an orderly rumbles by with an e
nursing supervisor dorothy kimball a pleasant lady in her late thirties leans out of her office to speak to one of the lounging orderlies
handing the orderly a slip all right jerry go up to holly six
the orderly detaches himself from his cronies and exits
it is into this atmosphere of subdued febrility that william mead is wheeled
kimball william mead from holly eight
hold him there tom
weve got somebody coming out right now
indeed a stretcher is being wheeled out of the holding room
the patient is sedated and covered
as the orderly wheels her past camera we may recognize the pale sleeping profile of miss campanella the nurse who had been coshed with a sandbag not many scenes ago
a circulating nurse comes through the glass doors examines the chart dangling from the stretcher
to this nurse whos that
checking wristband yeah
to orderly number three marty
the orderly wheels the silent miss campanella off to operating room three as dr
welbeck in his natty blue suit carrying his camel coat turns in from the outer corridor and examines the blackboard
he goes back to
welbeck crosses opens a door and enters
all four walls are lined with lockers
shelves and cartons of green surgical clothes caps masks trousers shoe coverings
obviously surgeons dress for their operations here
two surgeons one middle aged and the other a young resident are changing
the resident turns to welbeck on his entrance and says its legal for a doctor to incorporate in new york isnt it doctor
en route to phone since last september
if they had that when i was your age id have put away a couple of million by now
dials it gives you a variety of deferral devices profit sharing for example
lets say you pick yourself an october fiscal
you declare a bonus payable in
an accrued item payable to a principle share holder must be paid within two and half months after the close of the year to get the deduction in the prior
but your corporation doesnt pay that tax because weve eliminated the taxable income with the bonus
with two taxable entities you can bury a hell of a lot of expenses
on phone hello this is welbeck any messages
well im at the hospital
i have to cut open some guy in a couple of minutes
ill try to make it as fast as i can
how urgent did he say it was
hogan made those arrangements with the underwriters
the registration statement was filed with the s
well over a year ago
if he calls again have me paged here
hangs up turns back to the attentive young doctors to conduct his class in medical finance while changing into surgical scrub the really big money is in health leasing of
hogan the eminent orthopedic surgeon and i incorporated a leasing company and went public last year
i hold a controlling interest in a number of proprietary hospitals nursing homes and rest farms and ive been leasing hospital equipment to my own hospitals at excessive rates
why you ask am i draining my own hospitals
well my hospitals are taxed at percent and im giving my leasing company a hell of a price earnings ratio whichll balloon the market value of the stock
i hold three hundred thousand shares of that stock lettered of course but in a year ill dump those shares at a capital gain and walk off with a bundle
just like on tv well almost
the surgeon dr
mallory a bad tempered man in his fifties sits on a stool with his gloved hands wrapped in a towel waiting for the two surgical residents to finish painting the
operable area which happens to be the abdomen
its a hysterectomy
the patient is sheeted except for the small square of abdominal area
grumbles to one of the residents what do you say huh
were not going to hang it in the louvre you know
the anesthesiologist dr
chu injects pentathol in the i
bring a mask over
the resident anesthesiologist trundles over the oxygen tank takes the hypodermic syringe from dr
chu who now applies the oxygen mask to the enmarbled profile of the patient
he studies the gauges and equipment around him at the head of the operating table
theres no pulse doctor
whats the pressure
theres no blood pressure doctor
get the tube and e
whats the matter
i cant feel a thing sir
the room galvanizes into the swift silent activity of a chest massage
mallory standing and stretching in the back of the room turns and moves toward the off screen patient
he begins a vigorous rhythmic massage of the patients rib cage over the heart
what the hell happened
mallory thumps the patients chest hard with his fist and the others likewise go to work
i dont know
she must have thrown an embolus
she was doing fine up to now
to resident anesthesiologist did you check the gasses
i did sir
the only time i ever saw anybody conk out like this some jerk switched the nitrous oxide and the gas lines
the scrub nurse is applying electrode paste to the defibrillators
mallory yanks the sheets and hospital shirt off the patient and begins very rigorous massage of the exposed ribs we can hear one rib crack
get the damn leads on
for chrissakes what the hell is this
shes just a young woman sir
do you think we should open the chest
defibrillating shes fifty three you buttonhead
off screen bicarb
chu who has been inserting some suprel and bicarbonate into the tube of the patients i
is frowning at her rigid white capped face
he leans over to check the e
shes fibrillating doctor
mallory straddles the patient
hes doing heavy heart massage
okay stop for a minute
chu pushes back the operating cap on the patients head revealing jet black hair
mallory starts to massage again
barking at the scrub nurse you got those paddles ready
chu stares blankly at the patients face then looks up at the sweating surgeon perched on the operating table rhythmically crushing away at the patients rib cage
i may be crazy doctor but i dont think this is your patient
mallory now pausing for a moment looks up
he is beaded with sweat
what the hell are you talking about
he massages away
another rib cracks
the supervisor of nurses mrs
christie is sitting on a chair reading a report
bock now in his doctors coat is hunched over his desk hands clasped
now i dont want to get into an institutional hassle with you mrs
the malpractice here is monumental
as you see dr
schaefers blood sugar was twenty three
no glucose solution is going to do that
the only thing that will do that is at least fifty units of insulin probably more
the only presumption is that one of those nurses on the eighth floor shot fifty units of insulin into schaefers blood stream either by injection or through the i
although how in gods name
christies electric pocket pager beeps
im very sorry doctor
reaches for a phone may i
miss mcguire leans in from the secretaries office
to bock doctor did you ask the head nurse on the eighth floor to let you know when a miss drummond got there
well she just got there

the administrative resident hitchcock is here and a uniformed man in his fifties mr
sloan the chief of safety and traffic
sloan represents the hospitals security force
kimball is at her desk on the phone
on phone well i dont understand is she back in her room
when did she get back to her room

calls to a nurse passing are they still working on that woman in three
back on phone im sorry mrs
fried would you say that again
well nobody in this office sent her back up
well all right mrs
fried ill have to call you back
she hangs up stands goes out into
where three orderlies lounge about
did any of you take a woman named mangafranni out of the holding room back up to holly five around ten oclock
apparently none of these three
christie turns in from the outer corridor
normal operating room activity flows by patients wheeled to and from their various surgeries surgeons checking the blackboard staff doctors orderlies keeping the noise level low but steady
to hitchcock in the doorway what happened
hitchcock shrugs helplessly
christie i dont know what happened
a patient named mangafranni was scheduled for a hysterectomy at ten oclock dr
i talked to sylvia in the holding room who admitted her so she was here
and now i just spoke to mrs
fried on holly five and she says an orderly brought mrs
mangafranni back to her room about twenty minutes ago
mangafranni is in her room sleeping
well whos the woman in the operating room
i dont know
christie hitchcock and sloan push through the glass doors to the crossroads of the operating rooms
through each window we see operating crews hacking away
is she dead
well they had to open her up and thats not good
they gather in anticipation outside o
three and peer over each others shoulders into the room where the operating crew is hunched over the open heart massage
the masked circulating nurse looks up notices the audience at the door and gives a hopeless shrug
i better get mr
milton mead is sitting in a back seat of the staff room a lounge with couches easy chairs and magazine racks gives half an ear to the several opinions being
simultaneously expressed by abortion
the clinic should be under the supervision and entirely staffed by women and administered by a member of the womens committee for medical liberation
and by lets get to the core of the matter which is the criminal and gangster collusion between the american medical establishment and the drug insurance and tobacco companies who
through their combined racketeering efforts have produced a dual system of health care
everything for the rich and nothing for the poor
and by abortion clinic
thats genocide baby
youre just killing off blacks
we consider proliferation elemental to the class struggle
and by who has lost his cool altogether and is screaming right along with everyone else for gods sake
weve got eleven people in these buildings and weve got to get them out of there
we can rectify the injustices of the world tomorrow but right now for gods sake can we get those people out of those buildings
will you people please listen to me
will you people please shut up and listen to me
will you people please call a halt to this participatory democracy and address ourselves to the immediate problem
during this maelstrom the phone at meads elbow rings
mead answers it listens nods returns the receiver stand and slips out of the room into the delicious silence of the
where hitchcock emerges from the administration offices
the two men move down the hall toward each other
how long ago did this happen
about half an hour
have you called the medical examiner
well youd better do that now
and you better call the precinct station house as well
mallory is wrenching off his blood drenched rubber gloves and flinging them to the floor in a rage
the door to the room opens and mrs
christie and mr
mallory is stupefied with anger
chu blessed with eastern containment blandly gathers his equipment together nods to mrs
good morning doctor
this is really something isnt it
i thought she looked a little different when they brought her in
i even said to one of the nurses she looks a little younger without her dentures
id only talked to her half an hour before
does anybody know who she is
mallory can only stare at her numbly
he turns and stares numbly at mr
kimball examining the chart dangling from the operating table whats her chart say
her chart says mangafranni
her bracelet says mangafranni
the only thing that isnt mangafranni is the woman
mallory finally explodes
ive been chopping out three uteruses a day for twenty years and is it too much to expect for you people to bring in the right goddam jesus christ uterus
i had just been talking to her in the holding room
she was perfectly fine
a little drowsy
i thought it was funny that when they brought her in she was out cold
shuffling around in aimless circles jesus h
christie stares down at the face of the dead patient on the table who has had her chest spread wide open so that the organs are exposed
well well just all have to stay here until mr
mead or someone from the o
well im not taking the rap for this
ive already got one malpractice suit pending and im not taking the rap for this one
william meads bed is empty
the reverend drummonds suit still on its hanger is lying on it
drummond himself lies comatose and rigged out with i
s and catheters
barbara drummond is packing her fathers things into an open one suiter valise
the door opens
she looks up
they look at each other two people in love
look youre not going
i love you and im not going to let you go
he picks up the suit lying on the bed
come on lets start putting your fathers things back
hes staying here
hangs the suit in the closet ill find an apartment somewhere
im staying in a filthy little hotel room
we cant use that
his eyes are caught by a white doctors uniform hanging in the armoire along with the suits and overcoats of the two patients in the room
he bends over to peer at the nameplate over the breast pocket
i cant make it here herb
ill crack up
i cracked up once already
one week here and id be running naked through the streets screaming again
i can retain my sanity only in a simple society
for gods sake barbara you cant seriously see me living in a grass shack hunting jackrabbits for dinner
be sensible for gods sake
i am being sensible
what is it youre so afraid of leaving here
your plastic home
your conditioned air
your synthetic clothes
your instant food
im offering you green silence and solitude the natural order of things
mostly im offering me
i think were beautiful herb
utterly in love you make it sound almost plausible
i dont know why you even hesitate
whats holding you here
is it your wife
no thats all over
i suppose if im married to anything its this hospital
its been my whole life
i just cant walk out on it as if it never mattered
im middle class
among us middle class love doesnt triumph over all
herb dont ask me to stay here with you because i love you and i will
and well both be destroyed
he turns to her again
they both look away
ive got the bill here to pay yet

she gathers her raincoat and goes
bock follows her out into the
joseph lagerman head of nephrology perhaps remembered from an earlier scene has been waiting for bock
he joins them en route to the elevators
herb you asked me to find that dialysis nurse
what dialysis nurse
barbara has continued walking
bock starts to follow her
ill go pay the bill
the one who goofed on your patient drummond
bock turns back to lagerman
well her name is theresa campanella but you are not going to believe this herb
she died on the operating table in o
three about an hour ago
barbara is disappearing into an elevator
bock starts after her then turns back to lagerman
what do you mean she died on the operating table in o
they hurry down the corridor to the elevators
you mean she was the one
thats the one
i just identified her
what the hells going on around here
every time i try to find somebody in this hospital they either died of a heart attack in emergency or of anesthesia shock in an operating room
elevator doors open
a nurse and visitor get out
bock and lagerman go into
two or three people besides the elevator operator are there as well as a patient on a stretcher and an orderly
listen i just came from the o
theyre trying to find a dr
dont you have a kid named schaefer in your service
scowls mutters i had a schaefer
he died yesterday of an overdose of insulin
what do they want schaefer for
the holding room nurse says there was a dr
schaefer hanging around the holding room
it wouldnt have been your schaefer anyway
the nurse says it was senior staff a middle aged man
theres no senior staff named schaefer in this hospital
i told them that
i said i dont know any senior staff around here named schaefer
theyve got detectives down there everything
its a whole big investigation
the elevator stops at the seventh floor
the doors open and bock and lagerman stroll into
bock lumbers down the west corridor turns into
william mead sedated and apparently zonked out cold is being transferred from a stretcher back into bed by an o
orderly and nurses aid
bock rolls back the curtains around drummonds bed revealing the comatose patient his face sculptured against the white pillow an i
tube in his right arm a catheter projecting from under the sheet
bock lowers the protective railing leans in takes the mans pulse on his neck raises one closed eyelid then the other
the pupils stare vacuously back at him the eyelids drop closed as soon as they are released
in the background the orderly and aid finish tucking in william mead and exit wheeling their creaking stretcher out
the room is shockingly silent
bock goes to the window and frowns in thought
hold across the patient drummond on bock in the background at the window with his back to us
suddenly drummonds eyes open
he lies rigid his eyes staring dementedly into the air above him
slowly his left hand reaches out and carefully withdraws the catheter from his bladder lays it on the white sheet beside him and silently reaches over to withdraw the i
needle from his right arm
he lets the needle dangle dripping onto the bed
carefully he twists out from under his sheet swings his legs over the side of the bed and sits up
reverse across bock at the window pondering
with a swift lash of movement the double tubes of a stethoscope are whipped over his head and tightened around his throat
mad as a hatter i am the fool for christ and the paraclete of caborca
close two shot of bock being strangled drummonds face frozen in bland dementia behind him
off screen for heavens sake dad
what the hells going on
drummond pauses in his strangling and releasing the poor man altogether turns to his daughter in the doorway
camera dollies to include all three bock recuperating drummond staring madly and barbara infuriated with her father
annoyed we all thought you were at deaths door
whatre you doing out of bed
drummond abashed stands there a scolded schoolboy a rawboned figure in a hospital shift a stethoscope dangling from his right hand
to bock what happened
did he say anything to you
sufficiently recovered as a matter of fact he said i am the fool for christ and the paraclete of caborca
and youd better close the door because if hes going to tell everyone who walks in here hes the fool for christ and the paraclete of caborca theyll put us
hes already killed two doctors and one nurse
i am the wrath of the lamb and the angel of the bottomless pit
what do you mean he killed two doctors and a nurse
i mean hes killed two doctors and a nurse
and he just tried to kill me
he has something against doctors
somehow he got hold of a thousand units of insulin and put it in dr
schaefers intravenous solution
and somehow he got dr
ives to die of a heart attack in the middle of the emergency room
and somehow he got a dialysis nurse named campanella to die of anesthesia shock on an operating table
opens the closet points to the white doctors uniform hanging there hes been running around the hospital wearing dr
right now theyre looking all over the place for this mysterious dr
i know this all sounds as grotesque to you as it does to me but you can see for yourself your father is not the helpless comatose patient we thought
dont look at me like im the one whos crazy
ask your crazy father
i was merely an instrument of god
i killed no one
they all three died by their own hands ritual victims of their own institutions murdered by irony an eye for an eye biblical retribution
schaefer was first you see because he killed god
god was admitted to this hospital last monday under the name of guernsey
a cheerless gray sunlight fills the room as the fragile white haired and bearded old guernsey whose admittance to the hospital was the opening scene of the film is being
helped into the room by nurse felicia chile
she solicitously helps the wispy old man off with his coat and jacket and hat which she puts in the armoire
with palsied fingers the little old man unknots his stringy tie and unbuttons the collar which is three sizes too large
in the other bed drummonds eyes slowly open
off screen i was instantly aware of a divine presence
the old man is slipping out of his clothes to expose a thin little body in a torn nightshirt
off screen i was convinced this porcelain old man was in fact an angel of the lord
the old man sits back wheezing a little
nurse chile smiles nicely at him and takes her leave
for a moment drummond lies rigidly on his bed staring dully into the air and the old man sits with his hunched back to us
the room is silent except for his rheumy wheeze
off screen perhaps even christ himself
after a moment the old man rises and goes to the washbasin and with some wheezing spits into it
he shuffles back to bed
schaefer comes into the room with a professional smile and the patient guernseys chart
off screen our savior was it seems suffering from emphysema
schaefer perches on the bed beside guernsey and begins to take his history
off screen he was relentlessly subjected to the benefits of modern medicine
he was misdiagnosed mismedicated and put into shock by dr
schaefer raced off to intensive care where the resident compounded the blunder and induced a coma
i can tell you with authority that god is indeed dead
he died last monday under the name of guernsey
close up of drummond in deep shadow shows him sleeping
off screen a few hours later he appeared to me in a revelation
the room is lit only by the yellow light from the half opened bathroom door
guernsey walks out of the shadows hands raised
he shuffles to drummonds bedside and looks down on him from his frail height
softly rise up drummond
you are dead now you are restored
drummonds eyes open and roll to the direction of the voice
guernsey dressed only in his hospital shift is shuffling up and down the aisle of the room hands clasped behind his back like a mittel european intellectual head hunched forward
a little old man with a white beard talking to himself
those who killed you and those who killed me will die in our place
you are the paraclete of caborca the wrath of the lamb
the angel of the bottomless pit
guernsey closes his eyes in religious ecstacy
in this fashion has it been revealed to you
drummond starts to sob and slowly sits up in his bed imbued with belief
he looks mutely up at the frail old man who now raises his right hand and his face is transfigured into vast majesty
thunders out the age is closed
the end is at hand
the seal is broken
so saying he reverts to the little old man he was wheezing a bit and with some effort climbs back on his bed and lies there eyes closed
his thin high nose projects from the whiteness of his face
he sighs the rattling last sigh of life and dies
camera dollies slowly to close up of drummond lying motionless on his bed
his eyes are wide glinting in the shadows a man imbued
his cheeks are wet with tears of exaltation
off screen well
not quite the burning bush perhaps but prodigal enough for me
i was to avenge the death of god and my own brutalization
i was to kill doctors schaefer ives and welbeck and the dialysis nurse miss campanella whose negligence caused my coma
full shot of drummond
he raises his left hand flexing his fingers
then he moves his other arm his head his shoulders
obviously he is regaining his faculties
off screen i awaited a further sign from god which was given to me later that evening
schaefer it seems had arranged an assignation with a girl from the hematology lab named sheila
across drummond to the now empty other bed
all the lights are on
pan on nurse penny canduso and an orderly wheeling away the wrapped body of guernsey
intern schaefer at the door considers the empty bed with interest
moving to the bedtable he picks up the receiver of the phone
on phone hey sheila this is howard sheila
hey listen i got us a bed for tonight
a real honest to god bed
reprise the scene originally played under credits where dr
schaefer and his girlfriend sheila sneak into the room and undress
giggles and shushings gooses and fondles
boy i sure hope nobody walks in
during the replay however an additional segment is added
at one point the girl hanging her dress in the armoire turns and holds something up
whats this in your pocket
thats my insulin
put it back
what do you take insulin for
i didnt know you were a diabetic
it aint contagious dont worry about it
they head for the unoccupied bed
close up on drummonds profile
schaefers girl is leaving she tiptoes to the door peeks out
apparently the coast is clear
she quickly slips out
drummond on his chair
barbara perched on one side of her fathers bed bock on the other
william mead sleeps on
and you put schaefers insulin into the i
and then a second nurse came and plugged the i
jar into schaefer
god clearly intended a measure of irony here
the hospital was to do all the killing for me
all i need do was arrange for the doctors to become patients in their own hospital
accordingly the next morning i set out for dr
i put on dr
schaefers uniform pinched some digoxine from the pharmacy and a sandbag from a utility cart and found my way to dr
i coshed him with the sandbag gave him a massive shot of the digoxine
this you see brought on an instant condition of cardiac arrhythmia
when he came to i brought him down to the emergency room
the usual e
crush and motion goes on in the background
drummond escorts an obviously ill dr
ives to the admitting room
drummonds voice under the narration explains matters to miss aronovici at the desk
this is dr
hes in the nephrology lab
i was in there a little while ago and he was suddenly taken ill and i thought id better get him over here right away
off screen he had at that time perhaps an hour to live
prompt treatment would have saved his life
they go into the
ives seated on a table in evident distress breathes heavily
voice off as a staff doctor he was seen without preliminaries
an attendant takes his pulse pressure and respiration
voice off his vital signs were taken an electrocardiogram
pan slowly across the emergency room to catch its state of contained febrility
every curtained treatment room is occupied including the storage room in the back
the triage nurse and a second nurse behind the desk are busy on the phones
the triage nurse takes the history of the first in a line of five people seeking admission even as she answers her phone
we watch miss aronovici and the other nurse and dr
spezio and his two interns the two attendants all busy with one patient or another
voice off which revealed occasional ventricular premature contractions
an intern took his history
across drummond white uniformed standing in the back against the filing cabinets and linens watching the the new patients trickle and crowd in
voice off and then he was promptly
at the admitting desk a man in his forties is being signed in by a uniformed cop
voice off simply
forgotten to death
camera just stares at the pageant of pain
voice off mislaid among the broken wrists the chest pains scalp lacerations the man whose fingers were crushed in a taxi door the infant with the skin rash the child
swiped by a car the old lady mugged in the subway the derelict beaten by sailors the teenage suicide the paranoids drunks asthmatics the rapes the septic abortions the overdosed addicts
looking to the street doors as two ambulance attendants bearing a seventeen year old black girl on a stretcher burst in
shouting not breathing
they hurry into the admitting room past a nurse and into the
which is already galvanized into action
miss aronovici is at the girls pulse even as she is being transferred to the bed that has just been cleared of mr
mitgang and his concussion case
instructing attendant with mitgang better put him in the holding room
with the seventeen year old girl shes taking a little pulse
to triage nurse get an anesthesiologist one five one five
on screen we continue watching the scene of the overdose case treatment as the live action sound in the room fades behind drummonds tale
off screen the fractures infarcts hemorrhages concussions boils abrasions the colonic cancers the cardiac arrests the whole wounded madhouse of our times
reaction shot of drummond staring at this ceaseless panorama of pain tears streaking down his cheeks
off screen i wonder if i could have a minute of your time doctor
drummond turns to the voice
camera pulls back to include the man who had been brought into the e
by a uniformed cop
i am the fool for christ and the paraclete of caborca
well its an honor and a privilege doctor
ive been here ten minutes i cant seem to get anybody to help me
im suffering from some sort of amnesia
i cant remember my name
as a matter of fact its pretty screwy
i got mugged
two hours ago walking out of a coffee shop on fifty seventh street and second avenue eight oclock in the morning broad daylight i got mugged
a sixteen year old girl walks up to me shows me a knife about a yard long and says give me your wallet
i thought she was kidding
i mean theres hundreds of people walking right by
well she wasnt kidding
listen i said all i gots about twenty bucks
so she takes the wallet anyway
so i said how about leaving me my identification
i mean i had my drivers license my diners club my credit cards
but she took them all the whole damn wallet credit cards everything
so i stopped some guy i said hey you see that girl there walking away
he says yeah
i said she just stole my wallet credit cards and everything
he says well thats what they want the credit cards
so i started looking for a cop
i mean go find a cop right
well i finally find a cop
the girls halfway to south america by now probably bought the ticket with my credit cards
so the cop says whats your name
and you want to know something
i couldnt think of my name
the girl took all my identification you know what i mean
she took all my credit cards
so i said you know this is screwy
i cant think of my name
so he took me to the station house
the sergeant says whats your name
i said i dont know
she took all my credit cards
so they took me down here
so what do you think doctor
im nuts right
i finally flipped
pan slowly to drummond who stares at the nameless man
in background the door opens and mrs
cushing the lady from accounting enters
she calls out in her annoying voice from a chart
whos number s
is there anybody here who is that number
off screen in this way was it revealed to me the manner of nurse campanellas death
she was to die of the great american plague vestigial identity
drummond in his hospital shift gaunt and mad as a prophet sits rigidly on his chair
barbara perches on her fathers bed
bock wanders disorientedly about the room staring incredulously first at barbara and then at her father
so last night i coshed miss campanella with a sandbag sedated her with thorazine shaved her prepped her and parked her in a corridor of the x ray department for
why x ray
well at x ray a sedated body lying around unattended for five hours wouldnt seem unusual
her operation that is to say mrs
mangafrannis operation was not scheduled until nine thirty
so at nine fifteen this morning i rang for my nurse
you rang for your nurse
to insure one full hour of uninterrupted privacy
i got up wheeled miss campanella off to the operating rooms replaced her bed with mrs
mangafrannis exchanged charts and identity bracelets
she died officially of anesthesia shock
but in point of fact she died because she was wearing another womans identity
to bock god what do we do now
let me take him back to mexico
its a simple world there
if you turn him in theyll just cage him in the rockland state hospital for the criminally insane
let me take him back herb
are you kidding
well both take him
im going with you
get him dressed
were getting out of here before the police put us all in rockland state
i havent finished my work here
i have this welbeck to dispose of
i am the angel of the bottomless pit and the wrath of the lamb
oh dear hes having another revelation
bock holds drummonds coat and hat and crosses to take his arm
he finds the entranced drummond as rigid as a statue
look that ambulance must be here by now
you go down and get them
ill give him a shot of something to knock him out
well take him to the airport in the ambulance
they both hurry out of the room
drummond remains enmarbled in his trance
camera suddenly moves down to william mead whose eyes now open he has heard it all
in background drummond suddenly released from his catatonic trance heads for the armoire and extracts the white trousers of dr
he puts them on tucking in the tails of his hospital shift
he notices william mead staring at him
youre hallucinating again
william mead just stares at drummond
bock and barbara come hurrying around the corner from the west corridor
barbara heads for the elevators
bock heads for the nurses station
the eighth floor is going about its normal p
donovan is at her desk on the phone
edwards never showed up
im short staffed as hell
its just me and felicia
its like sunday
ill be at lunch
a nurses aid a bathrobed patient and two of his visitors stroll by
its the end of the lunch hour when the kitchen workers bring used trays back
yeah you gotta send me somebody
bock moves past mrs
donovan and into the pharmacy where we see him scouring the shelves for thorazine and a syringe
an elevator arrives disgorging milton mead and his resident assistant thomas hitchcock and of all people dr
richard welbeck himself
barbara and dr
biegelman go into the elevator
the doors close
milton mead and hitchcock head for the west corridor
welbeck in his natty double breasted suit and carrying his cashmere coat heads straight for the nurses station
well be in eight o six
chuckles into phone then what did she say
donovan im dr
i have a patient on this floor named drummond and id like to see his chart
ill call you back
bock immediately emerges from the pharmacy holding a bottle of thorazine and a wrapped hypodermic syringe
he scowls at welbeck who scowls back
can i have a few minutes of your time sir
he starts to pass mrs
donovan and would continue but welbeck lays a restraining hand on his arm
gilley tells me youre the one who initiated these proceedings against me
im busy welbeck
id like to know what you have against me
you turned up half stoned for a simple nephrectomy eight days ago botched it put the patient into failure and damn near killed him
then pausing only to send in your bill you flew off on the wings of man to an island of sun in montego bay
this is the third time in two years weve had to patch up your patients the other two died
youre greedy unfeeling inept indifferent self inflating and unconscionably profitable
aside from that i have nothing against you
im sure you play a hell of a game of golf
what else do you want to know
welbecks pocket beeper beeps
excuse me for a moment doctor
he reaches over the nurses desk for a phone this is dr
were you paging me
regarding bock with cold scorn how much do you make a year bock
for a guy who makes a lousy forty fifty grand
on phone hello arthur i understand youve been trying to reach me all morning
bock turns and heads back for
and down that through the kitchen workers and strolling patients to
which he enters
he is startled to find milton mead and hitchcock leaning over william mead who is up on one elbow and in a state
im telling you milton he pulls out all the wires and the tubes and he gets up and puts on a doctors uniform and he goes out and he murders
he just went out ten seconds before you came in
indeed there is no drummond to be seen
his bed is empty
bock nods to milton mead and hitchcock who nod back and crosses quickly to look into the bathroom which is likewise empty
and ill tell you something else about this crazy place you got here
there was a naked indian in here last night doing a war dance
thats the kind of crazy place youre running here milton
you got to get me out of here milton
this is a crazy place milton
milton meads pocket beeper beeps
milton mead reaches for the phone
appealing to bock i wake up last night theres a goddam indian in here a naked indian
what kind of hospital is this
on phone this is mr
mead are you paging me
a couple of hours later i wake up again and the guy in that bed there is getting out of the bed
to hitchcock are the police still in the building
youd better get them up here
all day long he lays there like a dead man
all of a sudden in the middle of the night he gets out of bed
i thought i was going crazy
on phone yes this is mead
you know what he says to me
he says youre hallucinating
listen i just saw a naked indian
now im seeing a ghost
i got to figure hes right im hallucinating right
ill be down directly
hangs up never rains but it pours
a fire just broke out in one of those condemned buildings
the squatters in the building came out
the police tried to arrest them and apparently the situation has erupted into a riot
to bock as he heads for the door im sure youre wondering what this is all about herb
youre not going to leave me alone in this crazy place milton
at the door with bock mr
hitchcock is staying with you
to hitchcock you better call the cops tom
the door slams
bock and milton mead stride up the corridor through the linen wagons and kitchen carts
i havent the time now and im not even going to try to tell you this curious story my brother just told me
ill fill you in on it at lunch some time
he waves his hand helplessly to indicate the utter incredulity of it all
rushes not to miss the elevator hold it
they reach an open elevator
mead goes in the doors close
the doors of a second elevator then open and barbara comes out
she and bock stare at each other
in background welbeck is on the phone at the nurses station
the ambulance is here
yeah but your father isnt
he put on schaefers uniform and has gone out to do gods work presumably the murder of dr
except that fellow on the phone over there is dr
in background on phone oh my god arthur

hogan about this
and on top of everything else the other patient in your fathers room overheard his whole confession and just told the chief administrator of the hospital
theyre sending for the cops
reverse across welbeck on phone at nurses station
in the background bock and barbara stare at him
almost apoplectic on phone oh my god arthur

angrily seizes the chart what room is it

he strides off angrily followed by an anxious bock and barbara for the
bock and barbara hurry along in welbecks wake
the son of a bitch has been draining the company with phony purchase orders on another company of which it now turns out his wife is the principal stockholder
ill send him up for twenty years
he wrenches open the door of marches in followed by bock and barbara
welbeck advances on william meads bed since he is the only patient in the room
hitchcock is on the phone
well drummond you dont seem that much the worse for the wear
william mead stares dully at welbeck
then he looks dully at bock
to hitchcock would you mind using some other phone
im expecting an important call

drummonds the other bed
the phone now buzzes
welbeck and hitchcock both head for it

william mead is painfully trying to get off his bed

the phone slips from his fingers
he turns to stare at bock and barbara
im wiped out
has suspended trading in my stock
he keels over like a felled tree falling face up on drummonds bed his legs dangling to the floor
william mead promptly hides his head under his sheet
bock moves quickly to the prostrate welbeck feels his throat for the carotid pulse pulls out his stethoscope rips welbecks shirt open and listens for heartsounds
he picks up the dangling telephone receiver gets a dial tone
on phone cardiac arrest holly eight
barbara strips off her coat
she is still in nurses uniform
she leans into the hall and calls a passing nurse
we have an emergency here
rips off welbecks natty jacket breathe him
barbara helps bock get welbecks dead weight onto the floor
on his knees bock straddles welbecks prone form balls his fist and belts welbeck on his chest
he begins intensive heart massage
barbara gets down on her knees opens welbecks mouth and commences mouth to mouth resuscitation
in the background the p
system blandly echoes off screen c
please clear all corridors
donovan and aides move c
into the room immediately followed by intern chandler rushing past them
he went to lunch
get that other bed out of here
william mead of course is still huddled under his sheet
he peers out from under his covers in wide eyed disbelief and ducks under again
bock massages welbecks heart
barbara continues mouth to mouth
nurse felicia chile hurries in pushing the emergency cart before her
to nurse chile as others begin moving william meads bed out of the room give him an ambu bag and an airway
off screen whats been happening
nurse chile has shunted the emergency cart aside to let the bed out and is extracting an ambu bag and tube from the carts lower shelf
to seventh floor nursing supervisor just outside door watch it
off screen c
please clear all corridors
nurse chile hands the berman airway and ambu bag to barbara who inserts the airway and the ambu tube into welbecks mouth and pumps in air by hand
bock massages away
donovan and intern chandler finally get mead and his bed out into the corridor where they park it
in background emergency activity on all sides
the resident cardiologist dr
geoffrey morse and anesthesiologist dr
lawrence loomis both thirty three come hurtling around the corner
she follows morse in as from the lobby corner two technicians come racing a max cart and an i
stand before them
behind them a bewildered hitchcock moves into view trying to determine whats going on
to intern chandler who is it
off screen dr
one of the patients had a cardiac arrest
hitchcock looks down at the sheeted figure hunched on the bed parked in the hallway and slowly pulls the sheet off his head
william mead stares up at him like a hunted animal
hitchcock covers meads head again
bock still massages sweating bullets by now
barbara works the ambu bag
morse is feeling welbecks groin for his femoral pulse
what do you have dr
total cardiac arrest
off screen dr
how long has he been like this
about a minute
no pulse no heartbeat no respiration
if we can see anything of welbeck through other bodies we notice almost all his clothes have been ripped off his body
loomis replaces barbara
all right ill take over
the two nursing supervisors have been getting the max cart ready snapping up the gateleg footrest and attaching the i
tube to the oxygen jar and that to the ambu bag
rushing in background with others im sorry doctor but we have another emergency in
shall we get him up on the cart
loomis bock and morse struggle to lift the the nearly naked dead weight of dr
welbeck up from the floor and onto the max cart
morse has picked up drummonds chart from the bed where welbeck had left it
all right who is this patient
whats the story on this patient
close up of bock trying to hoist welbeck and looking up slowly
is this his chart dr
bock cocks his head to him
whats his name
bock looks across to barbara now helping out at the max cart
she looks back at bock
they exchange a smile
yes his names drummond
thats his chart
straining under the effort the three doctors get welbeck off the floor
studying the chart oh christ the poor son of a bitch just had a nephrectomy a week ago
donovan exits into
donovan comes out hitchcock turns to her
was it drummond
who else would it be
hitchcock silently thanks god
off screen pick him up
put him on it
stop the massage
welbecks body is finally on the max cart
nurses and doctors converge on him
loomis sets about intubating welbeck and the nursing supervisor begins clamping the metal bands of the e
machine on each of welbecks extremities
while all this goes on bock and barbara have picked up the remnants of welbecks jacket trousers shirt and underwear
morse is squatting by the max cart reading the e
script as it rolls slowly out of the cart
get me the paddles
push another amp of bicarb
the nursing supervisor starts applying electrode paste to the defibrillating paddles
another nurse measures off an ampule of bicarbonate of soda which dr
loomis injects into the i
set it for two hundred
barbara unsnaps her fathers valise and stuffs welbecks garments in it
bock takes welbecks coat and piles drummonds things on top of that
the nursing supervisor hands dr
morse the defibrillating paddles to place on welbecks left breast
off screen thats two hundred
everybody bock away
all back away from the max cart
bock and barbara are at the window piled up with valise and coats they look like theyre off for europe
off screen one two three
he pushes the defibrillating button sending an electric shock through welbecks body so as to bounce it into the air
bock and barbara remain at the window with heart resuscitation team in background
barbara slips into her own coat in preparation for escape
in background did he convert
in background no hes still fibrillating
in background lets go to four hundred
sotto voce to bock what do we do now
bock is staring out the window
barbara stares out with him
looking down onto the u shaped drive of the entrance plaza of the hospital and first avenue full of traffic
a band of some fifty black and puerto rican youths including females and young white revolutionaries most in che guevara garb have broken past the security guards at the gates
and spill across the drive
some policemen and security guards move tentatively out of the hospital to intercept them
the shouting cant be heard from up here
off screen we hear the activities of the resuscitation team
off screen its four hundred
off screen everybody back one two three
sound of the shock
off screen that didnt work either
low crowd noises
bock looks out the window at the protesting mob below
off screen all right
let me have a c
of adrenaline and intercardiac needle
camera pans slowly up over the melee in the plaza to the fence
barbara and bock stare down at the crowd
off screen stop the massage
put another amp of bicarb
zoom down into the maelstrom to full shot of the reverend drummond dressed in schaefers white uniform standing on the slim island separating the uptown traffic from the downtown traffic
drummond is a private island of his own hands stretched to the skies
he is prophesying
barely audible above the traffic rumbling heedlessly around him let those who are in judea flee to the mountains for the age is closed the season of the seventh seal
is at hand
bock and barbara slip through doctors and nurses heading for the door
hang isopril two in five hundred
lets take one more crack with the paddles
everybody back off the cart
bock carrying two overcoats and barbara wearing hers and carrying her fathers valise exit into
as bock and barbara come out the activity is normal with the exception of william meads bed along the wall
hitchcock and two overcoated men are in the hallway and hitchcock hurries to bock
is he dead
they cant get him out of fib
i dont think hell make it
sighs turns to the two detectives this should close the case sergeant
bock and barbara hurry toward the elevators
the small army of militants and activists has broken through the security into the lobby
their entrance is greeted by one small scream from a woman in the lobby
a leader of the invading troop calls out
everybody take it easy
nobodys going to be hurt
we just want the director
others in the troop shout reassurances but it doesnt really reassure anybody
the lady in the gift shop closes her door and locks up
people crowd in a solid block in the doorway to the coffee shop to see whats going on
from the long tunnels of corridors nurses doctors administrative personnel pause in their chores and errands and missions to watch the tide of events in the lobby
the exit door is wrenched open and bock comes hurtling into the carpeted executive corridor toward the lobby and at that moment the troop of militants come rumbling in from
the other end
every door of the corridor fills with secretaries and administrators unsure of whats happening
then sundstrom elbows his way through the clutch of secretaries in his doorway and comes into the corridor
he regards the militants moving down the corridor toward him
we want sundstrom
we want sundstrom
hip hip hippocrates
up with service
down with fees
you people want to see me
yeah baby we want to see you

ambler the medical student we met during bocks teaching rounds pushes in front of the leader to face sundstrom
we the members of the doctors liberation committee indict this hospital for the criminal neglect of the community in which it is situated
we demand an immediate dissolution of the governing and executive boards
what are you going to do about those fourteen ghetto people
as the shouts continue sundstrom raises a hand to quiet the crowd
i am not going to do anything

eyes filled with tears of rage sundstrom lowers his head and moves into the mass of militants which parts for him to leave
the mass engulfs sundstrom moving back out into the lobby with him pushing him shoving him humiliating him
reaction shot of bock watching it all from the far end of the corridor
he closes his eyes and the pain of watching all this shows on his face
he opens his eyes
the corridor is now silent and empty
he hurries to
bock rushes in as the milling throng dissolves into the bystanders security police and city cops
common sense has settled in and the general tenor is to avoid any further trouble
we can hear the rhythmic patter of cops
all right come on
come on lets clear the area
come on lets clear this place
everybody keep cool
bock elbows his way through the throng as it drifts toward the doors to
and goes through the gathering police
a mobile tv camera crew and a few reporters are hurrying up through the gates from first avenue
the reverend drummond stands a solitary human island among the shrill roar of the city
the protesters protest endlessly chanting shouting
absolutely no one pays any attention to the gaunt doctor clad sixty year old man standing on an island
except of course for bock who must pause to wait for a red light
bock hustles through the traffic to where drummond stands
let those who are in judea flee to the mountains for the age is closed the season of the seventh seal is at hand
the age is closed
the season of the seventh se
welbeck is dead

in a day or two somebodyll ask whatever happened to dr
and it will be assumed he absconded to brazil to join his partner the eminent orthopedic surgeon dr
welbeck too was mislaid overlooked forgotten to death you see
the ambulance pulls up and barbara gets out of it
taking her father around to the back we have to hurry dad
the light turns green
the traffic starts flowing around them disjoined by the ambulance blocking one lane on each side of the dividing island
an ambulance attendant has opened the back doors to get drummond in
barbara hurries toward the front climbs in holds the door open for bock
he stands a few paces back
im not going
he moves to the ambulance closes the door the hospitals coming apart
i cant walk out on it when its coming apart
somebody has to be responsible barbara
everybodys hitting the road running to the hills running away
somebodys got to be responsible
across barbara to the driver kennedy airport

he turns and the ambulance pulls away
bock goes back to the sidewalk where he meets sundstrom now wearing his coat
you going back in
they make their way back toward
the two physicians trudge across the u drive
