written by john guare april john flanders kittredge and louisa kittredge flan and ouisa an attractive couple in their s in their night clothes are in an uncharacteristic state of
some sort of horrible disaster has happened to them
they survey their living room which under normal circumstances would appear to be a serene haven
but why are they so aghast
has the apartment been violated
the fifth avenue apartment red and cozy threadbare with the legacy of years of kids and dogs running in and out is filled with beautiful objects chosen with care
even though the apartment is th century in feel a lot of modern paintings hang on the walls
no visible disaster here
but then why flan and ouisas emotional state
they run between the hall and the living room
is anything gone
ouisa opens the front closet with trepidation
but nothing leaps out
she sees a mink is still there
how can i look
uisa runs into the living room
she can see by the discoloration on that wall that a painting is missing
call the police
there it is
an early abstract painting by kandinsky leans against a philadelphia chippendale chair the painting is wild and brilliantly colored
she picks the painting up and flips it around
its a double sided painting
the artist kandinsky had painted in different styles on either side of the canvas
one side of the painting is geometric and somber the other side is all chaos and brilliant colors
ouisa replaces the framed canvas on the wall where it belongs but the side she chooses to display is the geometric side
she admires it
flan opens the door from the hall into a computer
bulletin boards with prints of paintings tacked on
flan checks the slide projector is there
flan opens and closes cabinet drawers
ouisa appears in the doorway of the office
we couldve been killed
dont say that
the silver victorian inkwell
flan runs past ouisa down the hall back to the living room
ouisa follows him back into flan looks on an antique table crowded with framed family photographs going way back in time and all kinds of mementoes
how can you think of things
we could have been murdered
i want to know if anythings gone
he picks up an ornate victorian inkwell capped by a silver beaver and looks at it with great objectivity
theres the inkwell
ouisa drained looks out the window down onto central park
slashed our throats slashed
go to bed at night happy and then murdered
would we have woken up
but its their pug dog licking her leg
ouisa picks up the dog and pets it
flan remembers something and buries his face in his hands
we have to go to the wedding
i am in no mood to go to any wedding
we have to theyre your friends i beg to differ
theyre your fr flan stops frightened suddenly listening
ouisa runs to him terrified
he holds her
you dont call out hello unless they walk softly to the dark hall
i think we could tell if someone else was here
we didnt all night
they look down the silent dark hall
we dont know where we are yet but its certainly not the kittredges
the rain drumming outside and the distant thunder and the soft cool jazz playing makes the air of this room with the white wall wherever it is claustrophobic even erotic
a young black man whose name is paul comes into frame and leans against this white wall
right off you say this young man is a winner
paul frowns then smiles
right into the camera
someone off screen claps
paul bows to the off screen presence
ouisa and flan run out of their apartment building their clothes hastily pulled on their faces swollen with shock
they run down the side street into their car is waiting a mercedes flan slips the attendant a bill
flan gets in the drivers seat
ouisa gets in the passenger seat
flan a statement of fact im shaking
then ill drive
i have to hang on
lets just get there the sound of the rain the jazz the thunder
bottle of beer
bottle of beer
bottle of beer
an unseen young man off camera speaks elegant phrasing
bottle of beer
bottle of beer
you owe me
paul takes off his shirt
hes strongly built
he throws the shirt directly into the camera
flan is driving terrifically fast
ouisa puts on a tape
maria callas sings the death scene from la traviata
a car veers by
flan swerves his car
let me drive
driving calms me
when youre in one of these moods you do not drive well and i do not want to be killed today
we could have been killed last night
stop saying that
flan pulls himself together
he moves over to the slow lane
im driving slowly
i went in the room first
flan looks for signs
wheres the goddam turnoff onto the taconic
a truck veers and almost hits them
you didnt see what i saw
flan puts on brakes
its that fucking maria callas
turn that damn thing off
flan snaps off the tape deck
they resume driving
its not maria callas
its that truck and you
and last night
the countryside speeds by
lots of cars parked in front of this sweet rural wooden chapel near millbrook new york
the bride s gets out of a limo escorted by her father
ouisa and flan run up to the bride and kiss her
happy is the bride the sun shines on you look horrible
couldve been killed
they run into this
perfect country chapel with a dozen or so rows of pews is bedecked with flowers and lit by candles
a string quartet at the side of the little altar plays dvoraks american quartet
the usher in morning clothes greets flan and ouisa and shows them to their pew
i cant even remember how we met them
why are we here
they walk down the aisle heads down
do not make a scene
now i lay me down to sleep the most terrifying words just think of it i pray the lord my soul to keep the nightmare part if i should die
before i wake if i should die i pray the lord my soul to take couple in the pew in front turn
a man a woman strangely not unlike flan and ouisa perhaps a few years older perhaps more nautical as if theyd flown a in from nantucket are named sandy and
is anything wrong
we were almost murdered the people in the pew in front gasp
flan and ouisa are serious
the quartet plays the wedding march
the bride and her father walk down the aisle
cu ouisas face lost in thought
bright vivid colors fill the screen
later we will learn they are from a double sided painting by kandinsky which chaos
ouisas face appears briefly smiling then is replaced by dark geometric patterns
the other side of the painting
it is lowered to reveal ouisa very serious
the painting is flipped
flips it again
ouisa still frowning at her memory realizes the wedding ceremony is over
the bride and the groom run up the aisle beaming at everyone to the strains of lohengrin
but even they slow down when they see the state flan and ouisa are in
is everything all flan snaps out of it putting on his party smile
we always get this way at weddings
the bride and groom resume their run up the aisle
its flan and ouisas turn to leave the pew and go up the aisle
she is stricken
i do not always get this way at weddings
they walk up the aisle into the foyer of the chapel
she puts her head into his shoulder
oh it was awful awful awful awful
then ouisa and flan put on their best smiles as they pass through a receiving line finally shaking hands with the did you say you could have been killed
only hours ago
but were here
wouldnt miss it
the bride and groom look after them
a spankingly bright and solid country club in millbrook new york situated on the golf course grounds surrounded by lots of tennis courts
the wedding guests file into the cheery club all bright white and a shade of cheery green that only country clubs seem to find
more guests than could f it into the chapel are here in the club waiting for the bride and groom
flan and ouisa hesitate before going into the ballroom
they stop in the small quiet dark clubby bar
they sit at a small table pulling themselves together
sandy and connie the people from the pew in front of them come up to them
a woman who looks like a dormouse is with them
she is named julia
we hate to pry no no
youre not prying but what happened this is our friend julia do we know each other
oh yes through
havent seen them in years flan shakes hands with the new acquaintance
were worried for you flan and ouisa look at each other
sandy and connie and julia sit down at the small table
we were having a wonderful evening last night
a friend we hadnt seen for many years came by for dinner
i dont think you know him geoffrey miller
from south africa dont say it so portentously
geoffrey from south africa
dont be ga ga
they give their orders to the bartender
i didnt know geoffrey was in town
i saw him at susie baxters i wasnt at susie baxters sandy forgets he was married to susie baxter
the waiter goes
thats no reason why she cant invite me to a party
connie whispers to julia her eyes on flan
hes an art dealer
julia nods now thats shes remembered
flan hears it private sales
ouisa leans forward
somehow the telling calms her
the chums lean forward
we knew geoffrey through our children when geoffrey and his family all lived in new york
theyve moved back to south africa
he was here in new york briefly on business and asked us to ask him for dinner
hes king midas rich
the waiter puts down the tray of drinks
seventy thousand workers in just one gold mine
but he is always short of cash because his government wont let its people its white people its white people take out any money
so its like taking in a war baby
that ones mine they switch drinks
when he called it was like a bolt from the blue as i had a deal coming up and was short by flan puts down his drink
the figure is superfluous ouisa turns to connie
i hate when he uses the word superfluous
i mean we needed two million and we hadnt seen geoffrey in a long time and while geoffrey might not have the price of a dinner he easily might have
two million dollars
the currents last night were very churny
we werent sucking up
we like geoffrey
its that awful thing of having truly rich folk for friends
the money does get in the only if you let it
the fact of the money shouldnt get in having a rich friend is like drowning and your friend makes life boats
but the friend gets very touchy if you say one word life boat
the chums laugh
well thats two words
we were afraid our south african friend might say you only love me for my
but we like geoffrey
i know who he is now
didnt he invite us to visit him
it wasnt a life threatening evening
rich people can do something for you even if youre not sure what it is you want them to do
they turn at the sound of applause
the bride and groom have entered the country club and our table in the bar looks up as the wedding party passes by for a moment rushing past the bar
into the ballroom
off in the ballroom the small orchestra strikes up just one of those things for the ten thousandth time
everyone in the club is applauding and our table applauds too
ouisa starts to rise
not on your life
connie pulls ouisa back down to the table
flan signals another round
hardly a life boat evening ouisa sits enjoying this
but when geoffrey called and asked us to take him for dinner he made a sudden pattern in lifes little tea leaves because who wants to go to banks
flans voice takes us back to last night geoffrey called and our tempests settled into showers and life was manageable
what more can you want
geoffrey stands up into the frame an elegant impeccably british south african more english than the english ten years older than ouisa and flan
flan and ouisa are both dressed very stylishly and nattily tonight
but not trendy not so it shows
flan was definitely an athlete and he still keeps himself in trim
if hes in the art world theres nothing arty about him
ouisa stops doing what shes doing which is rolling out a drink trolley with little hors doeuvres on plates
flan stops doing what hes doing which is checking that a slide projector is in place on the desk along side the silver beaver inkwell
flan and ouisa both tense
it always amazes me when new york is so quiet
ouisa and flan relax and laugh
with the kids away we get used to a lower noise quotient
flan pours a drink for geoffrey
geoffrey you have to move out of south africa
youll be killed
why do you stay in south africa
one has to stay there to educate the black workers and well know weve been successful when they kill us
planning the revolution that will destroy you
ouisa sits back on the comfy sofa amazed at the thought
putting your life on the line
you dont think of it like that
i wish youd come visit
ouisa takes her drink and strokes the ears of her dog
but wed visit you and sit in your gorgeous house planning trips into the townships demanding to see the poorest of the poor
are you sure theyre the worst off
i mean weve come all this way
we dont want to see people just mildly victimized by apartheid
we demand shock
it doesnt seem right sitting on the east side talking about revolution
only small murky cafes for pepe le noko here
i will come to south africa and build barricades and lean against them singing
and the people would follow
follow follow follow
whats that song
the way gorbachev cheered on the striking coal miners in the ukraine yes you must strike it is your role in history to dismantle this system
russia and poland you cant believe the developments in the world he remembers the fantasticks sings follow follow follow
flan and ouisa despair oh
oy vay china
as my grandmother would say
our role in history
and we offer ourselves up to it
that is your role in history
not our role
ouisa ponders this thought
a role in history
to say that so easily
geoffrey suddenly gets up and looks through the telescope by the window
geoffrey flashes down nine floors into central park
he frowns in puzzlement when he sees baying up into the sky
flan and ouisa look at geoffreys back and then at each other
how to keep the ball rolling
flan to geoffrey do you want another drink before we geoffrey turns into the room
the phrase striking coal miners i see all these very striking coal miners modelling the fall fashions
where should we
theres good szechuan
the sign painter screwed up the sign
instead of the hunan wok he painted the human wok
new york has become the florence of the sixteenth century
genius on every corner
i dont think genius has kissed the human wok
they finish off their drinks
the new italian looked cheery
flan and ouisa good
we made reservations
flan looks at the slide projector
geoffrey id like to show flans sentence hangs in mid air as geoffrey follows ouisa ouisa burrows in the closet getting her coat and geoffreys coat out of the hall
closet stuffed with tennis rackets and skis and boots
this restaurant they wrap ravioli up like salt water taffy
flan appears behind her to help her
they both wrestle the coats out of the closet
six on a plate for a few hundred dollars
and flan gets the coats
a clatter of tennis rackets falling
geoffrey takes his topcoat
you have to come to south africa so i can pay you back
ill take you on my plane into the okavango swamps did you hear to take back to johannesburg
out in eastharpton a guy goes into one of the better food stores dean and deluca flan helps ouisa on with her coat
one of the dean and deluca look alikes
gets a pack of cigarettes and an ice cream bar
goes up front
sees theres a line at the register
slaps down two twenty dollar bills and goes out
geoffrey doesnt get the anecdote
we sent it to the times
geoffrey smiles politely
flan and ouisa press a little bit too hard
they have the joke page of things around new york
they send you a bottle of champagne
they all laugh brightly
the chums listen enrapt
ouisa is serious
we werent auditioning but i kept thinking two million dollars two million dollars
its like when people say dont think about elephants and all you can think about is elephants elephants elephants
two million dollars two million dollars
ouisa and flan laugh brightly
the front doorbell rings
ouisa and flan look at each other
who is that
ouisa goes into the hall
what ever you do dont think about elephants
flan rapidly steers geoffrey to a chair closes the living room door then wheels a projector with a carousel tray into place
louisa is a dada manifesto
about the cezanne unless were careful itll be sold and never seen again flan switches off the rooms lights and clicks on the projector
the slide projection of a beautiful green landscape by cezanne fills the wall by the door
landscape of a dark green forest
in the far distance you see the sunlight
one of his first uses of a pale color being forced to carry the weight of the picture
the experiment that would pay of f in the apples
a burst of color asked to carry so much the japanese dont like anything about it except its a cezanne and suddenly the door in the wall opens up
a young black man supported by the elevator man eddie appears in the cezanne forest holding his eyes against the projectors light
and ouisa behind him
flan clicks off the projector
ouisa switches on the living room lights
the young black man paul is in his early twenties very handsome very preppy
his shirt front is ripped and bloodied
eddie helps paul to the sofa ouisa following at a loss
im so sorry to bother you but ive been hurt and ive lost everything and i didnt know where to go
your children im a friend of the chums are transfixed
and he mentioned our childrens names
and the school where they went
you can say harvard
we dont want to get into libel
paul exhausted and scared i was mugged
in central park
by the statue of that alaskan husky
i was standing there trying to figure out why there is a statue of a dog who saved lives in the yukon in central park and i was standing there
trying to puzzle it out when are you okay
they took my money and my brief case
i said my thesis is in there paul looks down
he sees the blood seeping through his shirt
his shirts bleeding
his shirt is not bleeding
paul holds his mouth nauseous
i get this way around blood
flan leading paul out of the room not on the rug
eddie get the doctor eddie turns to leave
no doctors paul frightened looks at flan
flan to eddie well call if we need any flan helps paul out of the room down the hall
thank you eddie eddie goes
flan followed by ouisa supports paul into paul sits on the side of the tub
paul takes off his blazer and pulls off his ripped shirt
his tie is still around his neck
there is a good sized knife slash in his side by his rib cage
ouisa and flan cringe
flan opens the medicine cabinet
i dont mind the money
but in this age of mechanical reproduction they managed to get the only copy of my thesis
wheres the first aid book
ouisa runs into their bedroom
paul looks out the bathroom door into flan and ouisas bedroom
paul watches ouisa as she goes into ouisa rummages through her book case and finds her red cross manual
ouisa turns and sees paul sitting on the edge of the tub staring at her
flan is crouched down bathing pauls slash
ouisa is moved by these events
we bathed him
we did first aid
ouisa reads from the manual
the red cross advises press edges of the wound firmly together wash area with water yes
im doing that hold on flan daubs on mercurochrome
i need gauze
geoffrey pokes his head in the bathroom
its been wonderful seeing you ouisa firm but cheery no no no
my time is so short
before i leave america i really should call you darling old poop have you seen the new book on cezanne
an absolute revelation thisll only take a mo ouisa rushes out of the bathroom after geoffrey
i need the gauze i ran down the hall to get the book on cezanne got the gauze from my bathroom we watch a flustered ousia dart about as she
describes gave the cezanne to flan who wanted the gauze gave the gauze to geoffrey who wanted cezanne
ouisa mutters under her breath as she dashes down two million dollars two million dollars geoffrey stares at the gauze hes just been handed
ouisa grabs the gauze out of geoffreys hand
she runs back down the hall
two million dollars two million dollars flan finishes bandaging pauls wound
ouisa goes into she takes a pink shirt from the bureau
paul puts on the pink shirt and looks at himself in the mirror
hes going to be fine
geoffrey appears in the door with the book on cezanne
flan looks stricken
and peace was restored
flan holds out pauls blazer
paul winces as he lifts his arms to put it on
your children said you were kind
all the kids were sitting around the dorm one night dishing the shit out of their parents
but your kids were silent and said no not our parents
not flan and ouisa
not the kittredges
the kittredges are kind
so after the muggers left i looked up and saw these fifth avenue apartments
onassis lives there
i know the babcocks live over there
the auchinclosses live there
but you lived here
i came here
ouisa so touched turns to flan and geoffrey
can you believe what the kids said
paul looks at the framed photos on wall of but your kids i love them
talbot and woody mean the world to me
he lets you call him woody
nobodys called him woody in years
they come into paul looks around happily
he goes to the wall by the mantlepiece and looks at a dark abstract painting
they described this apartment in detail
this is a kandinsky
one painted on either side
may i see
ouisa lifts the painting off the wall and turns it around
even geoffrey is taken by the painting
what makes it valuable is kandinsky painted on either side of the canvas in two wildly different styles
one side is geometric and somr r
the other side is wild and vivid
we flip it around for variety
ouisa happily turns the painting back and forth to show off its two sides
the screen is filled with the bright colors then the dark colors
she puts on a goofy happy face for the chaotic side and a dopey tragic face for the geometric
weve been here before through ouisas memory at the wedding
ouisa leans the painting against a chair the chaotic side showing
flan turns to julia
blue rider exhibition
he said it is clear that the choice of object that is one of the elements in the harmony of form must be decided only by a corresponding vibration in
the human soul
very spiritual died france
paul looks around the apartment so cozy warm
its the way they said it would be
geoffrey had been silent up to now
did you bitch your parents
as a matter of fact
your kids and i
we both liked our parents
loved our look am i getting in the way
i burst in here hysterical
i didnt mean to flan and ouisa no
tell us about our children
flan to julia three
two at harvard
another girl at groton
its just there
everyones in a constant state of luxurious despair and constant discovery and paralysis
we asked him where home was out west he said
although ive lived all over
my folks are divorced
hes doing a movie
hes in the movies
hes directing this one but he does act
whats he directing
someone is directing a film of cats
dont be snooty
eliot well yes
a benefit for some disease or school surely they cant make the movie of cats
of course they can
theyre going to try
my fatherll be here cats
hes going to use people
what a courageous stand
they thought of lots of ways to go
animation would be nice
but he found a better way
as a matter of fact he turned it down at first
he went to tell the producers as a courtesy all the reasons why you couldnt make a movie of cats and in going through all the reasons why you couldnt
make a movie of cats he suddenly saw how you could make a movie of cats eureka in the bathtub
may we ask who can it be possible
a few more guests have joined the table
and it was here we pulled up ever so slightly pulled up closer and he told us
he named the greatest black star in movies
dont say it
were trying to keep this abstract
plus libel laws
sidney poitiers there
i dont care
we have to have truth
he started out as a lawyer and is terrified of libel
paul leaning against the wall talks with great vivacity to that off screen presence who is the pov of the camera
sidney poitier the future jackie robinson of films was born the twenty fourth of february in miami during a visit his parents made to florida legally
to sell tomatoes they had grown on their farm in the bahamas
he grew up on cat island so poor they didnt even own dirt he has said
neglected by his family my father would sit on the shore and as he told me many times conjure up the kind of worlds that were on the other side
and what id do in them
he arrived in new york city from the bahamas in the winter of at age fifteen and a half and lived in the pay toilet of the bus station across
from the old madison square garden at fiftieth and eighth avenue
he moved to the roof of the brill building commonly known as tin pan alley
washed dishes at the turf restaurant for
he taught himself to read by reading the newspaper
in the black newspaper the theater page was opposite the want ad page
among his films are no way out cry the beloved country blackboard jungle the defiant ones raisin in the sun lilies of the field in the heat of the night
to sir with love shoot to kill and of course guess whos coming to dinner
he won the oscar for lilies of the field and was twice named top male box office star in the country
my father made no films from to but worked as director and author
dad said to me once i still dont fully understand how all that came about in the sequence it came about
and we hear the off screen presence applauding
paul bows happily
he kicks his shoe off into the camera
dads not in till tomorrow at the sherry
i came down from cambridge
thought id stay at some fleabag for adventure
down and out
i really dont know new york
i know rome and paris and los angeles a lot better
were going out to dinner
out to dinner
out to dinner
but why go out to dinner
because we have reservations and oh my godwhat time is it
have we lost the reservations and we dont have a damn thing in the house and its sixteenth century florence and theres genius on every block
she kisses geoffrey
you must have something in the fridge
a frozen steak from the ice age
why spend a hundred dollars on a bowl of rice
let me into the kitchen
cooking calms me
what id like to do is calm down pay back your kids he mentioned our kids names flan turns to a newcomer
two at harvard
a daughter at groton
whove been wonderful to me
theyve never mentioned you
what are they supposed to say
weve become friends with the son of sidney poitier barrier breaker of the fifties and sixties
your father means a great deal in south africa
even geoffrey was touched
im glad of that
dad and i went to russia once to a film festival and he was truly amazed how much his presence meant oh no
tell us stories of movie stars tying up their children and being cruel
if i wanted to write a book about him
i really cant
no one would want to read it
i admire him
hes married to an actress who was in one of shes white
am i right
paul painful territory that is not my mother
that is his second wife
he met joanna making the lost man
he left my mother who had stuck by him in the lean years
x had just been born
the lost man is the only film of my fathers i cant bring myself to see
oh im sorry
we didnt mean to no
were all good friends now
his kids from that marriage
us the old kids
id love to get in that kitchen
flan to ouisa what should we do
its geoffreys only night in new york
i vote stay in
ouisa flan and paul good
into the kitchen
the kitchen is large was built in the when people had big dinners at home
paul opens the refrigerators and freezers
pauls actions are synchronous with the words
we watched him cook
we watched him cook and chop
he sort of did wizardry an old jar of sun dried tomatoes left avers tuna fish olives onions its all dazzling and rapid
flan opens the wine
ouisa takes dishes and silver out and hands them to geoffrey
everyone is in a picnic spirit
paul fills a large pot with water from the tap
paul to geoffrey johannesburg
paul studies geoffrey
ouisa and flan freeze
is it a tense moment
paul takes a breath
paul puts the water on the fire eyes never off geoffrey
then paul resumes chopping onions briskly and dropping them into the frying pan
my dad took me to a movie shot in south africa
the camera moved from this vile rioting in the streets to a villa where people picked at lunch on a terrace the only riot the flowers and the birds gorgeous
plumage and petals
and i didnt understand
and dad said to me you meet these young blacks who are having a terrible time
theyve had a totally inadequate education and yet in the year of the soweto riots they took on a tremendous political responsibility
it just makes you wonder at the maturity that is in them
paul opens a cabinet and takes out a haitian candelabra that obviously hasnt been used since it was brought home as a souvenir
paul dusts it off
it makes you realize that the crummy childhood theory that everything can be blamed in a freudian fashion on the fact that youve had a bad upbringing just doesnt hold
paul pours a brandy
what about being black in america
paul scoops a melange of vegetables into a glass dish and puts it in the microwave
my problem is ive never felt american
i grew up in switzerland
there is a boarding school in switzerland that takes you at age eighteen months
thats not me
ive never felt people liked me for my connections
movie star kid problems
none of those
the water boils
he dumps in pasta
the microwave timer goes off
paul removes the glass dish
but i never knew i was black in that racist way till i was sixteen and came back here
after the divorce we moved to switzerland
my mother brother and z
i dont feel american
i dont even feel black
i suppose thats very lucky for me even though freud says theres no such thing as luck
just what you make
paul takes the pasta off the boil and drains it plopping the pasta into a brightly colored bowl
ouisa flan and geoffrey sit at the counter transfixed
does freud say that
paul holds out three dishes heaped with food
shall we move into the dining room
ouisa opens double doors leading into this room has not been in use for a while
the overhead chandelier is very bright and harsh
a sewing machine is in the corner there
bookkeeping items at one end of the long table
nineteenth century victorian mythological paintings hang
on the walls
flan adjusts the rheostat to dim the lights in the chandelier
dont look at the sewing machine
flan sweeps the bill things off the table onto a chair
ouisa opens the sideboard and takes out four linen place mats and silverware and quickly sets the table
paul takes out matches and lights the haitian card eyabra
flan runs into the living room and returns with a vase of flowers
they smile at the appearance of the sudden party in this wonderful room
they sit down
is everything okay
flan ouisa and geoffrey mmrmmm
this is the best pasta ive ever the best
my father insisted we learn to cook
isnt he from jamaica
theres a taste of the islands
before he made it he ran four restaurants in harlem
you have good buds
ive never been complimented on my buds i am astonished
paul leans back and watches them happily
the cook never eats
the more for us
they all laugh
paul leaves the room abruptly
flan ouisa and geoffrey look at each other
paul returns with the rest of the real in brightly painted bowls
they laugh and are served
have you declared your major yet
youre like all parents
whats your major
geoffrey harvard has all those great titles the students give courses
the holocaust and ethics
krauts and doubts
i think were lucky having this dinner
isnt this the finest time
a toast to you
whats he like
ouisa reaches for the bottle of wine
lets not be star fuckers
im not a star fucker
my father being an actor has no real identity
you say to him pop whats new
and he says i got an interesting script today
i was asked to play a lumberjack up in the yukon
now ive been trained as a preacher but my church fell apart
my wife says we have to get mbney to get through this winter
and i sign up as part of this team where all my beliefs are challenged
but i hold firm
in spite of prejudice because i want to get back to my wife
out of this forest back to the church
and my father is in tears and i say pop this i
not a real event this is some script that was sent to you
and my father says i m trying it out to see how it fits on me
but he has no life he has no memory only the scripts producers send him in the mail through his agents
thats his past
can it be
the crowd listening to flan and ouisa is even larger
i just loved the kid so much
i wanted to reach out to him
and then we asked him what his thesis was on
the one that was stolen
he takes a deep breath and leans back in a substitute teacher out on long island was dropped from his job for fighting with a student
a few weeks later the teacher returned to the classroom shot the student unsuccessfully held the class hostage and then shot himself
this fact caught my eye last sentence
a neighbor described the teacher as a nice boy
always reading catcher in the rye
the nitwit chapman who shot john lennon said he did it because he wanted to draw the attention of the world to catcher in the rye and the reading of
that book would be his defense
and young hinckley the whiz kid who shot reagan and his press secretary said if you want my defense all you have to do is read catcher in the rye
it seemed to be time to read it again
i havent read it in years
ouisa shushes flan
i borrowed a copy from a young friend of mine because i wanted to see what she had underlined and i read this book to find out why this touching
beautiful sensitive story published in july had turned into this manifesto of hate
i started reading
its exactly as i remembered
everybodys a phoney
page two my brothers in hollywood being a prostitute
page three what a phony slob his father was
page nine people never notice anything
then on page twenty two my hair stood up
remember holden caulfield the definitive sensitive youth wearing his red hunters cap
a deer hunter hat
like hell it is
i sort of closed one eye like i was taking aim at it
this is a people shooting hat
i shoot people in this hat
hmmm i said
this book is preparing people for bigger moments in their lives than i ever dreamed of
then on p
id rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw
i hate fist fights
what scares me most is the other guys face
i finished the book
its a touching story comic because the boy wants to do so much and cant do anything
hates all phoniness and only lies to others
wants everyone to like him is only hateful and is completely self involved
in other words a pretty accurate picture of a male adolescent
geoffrey are transfixed
and what alarms me about that book not the book so much as the aura about it is this the book is primarily about paralysis
the boy cant function
and at the end before he can run away and start a new life it starts to rain and he folds
now theres nothing wrong in writing about emotional and intellectual paralysis
it may indeed thanks to chekhov and samuel beckett be the great modern theme
the extraordinary last lines of waiting for godot lets go
yes lets go
stage directions they do not move
but the aura around this book of salingers which perhaps should be read by everyone ut young men is this it mirrors like a fun house mirror and amplifies like
a distorted speaker one of the great tragedies of our times the death of the imagination
because what else is paralysis
the camera moves closer and closer in on paul
the imagination has been so debased that imagination being imaginative rather than being the lynch pin of our existence now stands as a synonym for something outside ourselves like science
fiction or some new use for tangerine slices on raw pork chops what an imaginative summer recipe and star wars
so imaginative and star trek so imaginative
and lord of the rings all those dwarves so the imagination has moved out of the realm of being our link our most personal link with our inner lives and
the world outside that world this world we share what is schizophrenia but a horrifying state where whats in here doesnt match up with whats out there
why has imagination become a synonym for style
i believe that the imagination is the passport we create to take us into the real world
i believe the imagination is another phrase for what is most uniquely is
jung says the greatest sin is to be unconscious
our boy holden says what scares me most is the other guys face it wouldnt be so bad if you could both be blindfolded most of the time the faces
we face are not the other guys but our own faces
and its the worst kind of yellowness to be so scared of yourself you put blindfolds on rather than deal with yourself
to face ourselves
thats the hard thing
thats gods gift to make the act of self examination bearable
flan geoffrey ouisa are very moved
i hope your muggers read every word
ouisa chiding flan im going to buy a copy of catcher i
the rye at the airport and read it
cover to cover ill test you

paul starts to go
the dining room opens into where will you stay

geoffrey puts on his overcoat

flan and ouisa no
im sorry oh christ geoffrey to flan theres all ways of doing business
flanders walk me to the elevator

ouisa kisses geoffrey on the cheek
it seems the bride and groom have joined the people listening to flan and ouisas tale
and flan and geoffrey left flan walks geoffrey to the elevator leaving ouisa and paul alone
paul and ouisa look at each other
then paul breaks the moment and goes to let me clean up ouisa follows
hal leave it for paul looks at the table filled with dishes and bowls and glasses and napkins
nobody comes in on sunday
paul snuffs out the candles with his fingers
yvonne will be in on tuesday
youll have every bug in christendom the room is dark lit only from the living room
they both reach for the dishes
let me paul takes the dishes
it gives me a thrill to be looked at
paul looks at her
ouisa is momentarily at a loss
paul goes into the kitchen
the service door into the kitchen swings back and forth
ouisa in the dining room looks at pauls back as he washes dishes at the sink
suddenly the dining room is flooded with light
flan has flicked on the light
flan parades around the table
hes in for two million
he says the cezanne is a great inv stment
we should get it for six million and sell it to the tokyo bunch for ten
paul comes into the dining room
two million dollars
flan runs into flan picks up the slide carousel and kisses it
figure it out
he doesnt have the price of a dinner but he can cough up two million dollars and the japs will go ten
paul and ouisa come into the living room
go to ten
break all those dishes
go to ten
and we put up nothing
geoffrey sold that hockney print i know he bought for a hundred bucks fifteen years ago for thirty four thousand dollars
sotheby took their cut sure but still two million
paul i should give you a commission
your kids said you were an art dealer
but you dont have a gallery
i dont understand people want to sell privately
not go through a gallery
flan holding up a slide people come to me looking for a certain school of painting
but dont want museums to know where it is
ouisa flan and paul go down the hall to flan flicks on his computer
ive got japanese looking for a cezanne
i have a syndicate that will buy the painting
there is this great second level cezanne coming up for sale in a very messy divorce
flan holds up the slide
wife doesnt want hubby to know she owns a cezanne
paul looks at the slide
i needed an extra two million
invited him here for dinner
tonight was a very nervous very casual very big thing
i couldnt tell s paul gives the slide very carefully back to flan who files it
all the better
flan opens a door in the office
the office connects to paul follows flan and ouisa into their bedroom
im glad i helped you were wonderful
im so pleased i was wonderful
all this and a pink shirt
look at the time
its going to be time for me to get up
then well say our good nights now

paul and ouisa follow flan into paul goes into their daughters bedroom
flan and ouisa hover in the hall
flan takes out his wallet
take fifty dollars
give him fifty dollars
dont need it
suppose your fathers plane is late
walking around money
i wouldnt want my kids to be stuck in the street without a nickel
paul sits on the bed and takes off his shoes
and you saved us a fortune
do you know what our bill wouldve been at that little eye tie store front
and we picked up two million dollars
one billionth of a percent commission is fifty dollars
flan hands paul the money
paul hesitates then takes it
but ill get it back to you tomorrow
i want my father to meet you
wed love to
bring him up for dinner
you see how easy it is
if paul does the cooking
flan ouisa and paul laugh
ouisa goes into the bathroom and fills a glass with water and puts it on the night table
paul smiles at them
flan and ouisa get ready for bed undressing hanging jacket and trousers up neatly
ouisa undoes her dress
they are in and out of bathroom and bedroom brushing teeth
i want to get on my knees and thank god money who said when artists dream they dream of money
i must be such an artist
flan putting on pajamas ouisa her nightgown
i dont want to lose our life here
i dont want all the debt to pile up and crush us
ouisa in bed turns off the light
flan looks out the window onto the park
for a while
we almost lost it
if i didnt get this money
ouis i wouldve lost the cezanne
it wouldve gone
i had nowhere to get it
ouisa gets out of bed and comes to flan
why dont you tell me how much these things mean
you wait till the last minute ouisa and flan get into bed
i dont want to worry you
not worry me
im your partner
there is a god
and his name is geoffrey
the camera comes in very close circling flan and ouisa their love their safety
then the camera drifts back and away from them travelling out through the window out of their cocoon to down the face of the solid apartment building and drifts away
through the night down into central park and stops at the statue of the husky barking at the moon
i dreamt of sidney poitier and his rise to acclaim
i dreamt that sidney poitier sat at the edge of my bed and i asked him what troubled him
what troubles you
is it right to make a movie of cats
flan is asleep on his side of the bed
ouisa is wide awake staring at a man in dinner clothes who sits on the edge of her bed
his back is to the camera
is it sidney poitier
the camera drifts in to ouisa who is transfixed by this apparition
sidney very comforting ill tell you why i have to make a movie of cats
i know what cats is louisa
may i call you louisa
ouisa nods yes i have no illusions about the merits of cats
but the world has been too heavy with all the right to lifers
protect the lives of the unborn
when does life begin
or the converse
the end of life
the right to die
why is life at this point in the th century so focussed on the very beginning of life and the very end of life
what about the eighty years we have to live between those two inexorable book ends
the camera closes on ouisa
her face seen over sidneys shoulder is all wonder
and you can get all that into cats
the camera drifts round with ouisas gaze to finally see sidneys face
it is paul
im going to try
the camera circles off paul to ouisa
she is asleep
cut back to reveal no one is sitting on the bed
the camera moves onto flans face sleeping
slides of paintings by matisse picasso de kooning pollock appear over his face
this is what i dreamt
i didnt dream so much as realize this
i felt so close to the paintings
i wasnt just selling like pieces of meat
i remembered why i loved paintings in the first place what had got me into this and i thought dreamed remembered flan happily sits in the bright vast empty space
at a slide carousel projecting slides of paintings into the air
how easy it is for a painter to lose a painting
he can paint and paint work on a canvas for months and one day he loses it just loses the structure loses the sense of it you lose the painting
a bright white light shines on flan who turns to see a teacher in her forties very pure and happy hanging beautiful and brilliantly colored childrens drawings in the air
flans voice echoes in this vast space
why are all your students geniuses in the second grade
look at the first grade
blotches of green and black
look at third grade
but the second grade your grade
youve made my child a matisse
let me study with you
let me into the second grade
what is your secret
i dont have any secret
i just know when to take their drawings away from them
the teacher hangs pink shapes like paper versions of pauls button down shirt on a clothes line stretching to the end of the hangar
the screen is filled with the color pink
the bright pink morning sky flashes with golden blotches abstract until we see it is the morning sun reflecting off windows on the west side of central park
then we realize it is the view from the camera pulls back from the window to flan and ouisa in bed cozy
she wakens smiles kisses him
flan mumbles in his sleep and rolls over
ouisa looks at her bedside clock
she gets out of bed then pauses to take in the dawn display
ouisa walks through and opens the front door
she picks up the sunday papers and goes into ouisa looks at the spotlessly clean sink and counter
she flicks on the coffee machine and takes juice out of the refrigerator scanning the front page
she sits at the counter and opens the magazine to the back page and begins to do the cross word puzzle
the chums hang on ouisas every word
i sat in the kitchen happily doing the cross word puzzle in ink
everybody does it in ink
met one person who didnt say they did it in ink
ouisa fills in a word on the puzzle
is it in ink
then looks up
and im doing the puzzle and i see the time and its nearly seven and paul had to meet his father and i didnt want him to be late and
was he healthy after his stabbing
ouisa puts the puzzle down and goes into the hall is eighteen feet long
ouisa walks down the hall which now seems impossibly long
i stopped in front of the door
ouisa taps on the door of her daughters room
she hears what
sounds of moaning
are you all right
ouisa opens the door to she turns on the light
a guy mid s buck naked except for ratty white socks stands up on the bed
what the fuck is going on here
who the fuck are you
paul startled sits up in bed and pulls on his clothes
ouisa shakes flan violently
flan comes to
what is it
flan and ouisa step out into they hear their dog bark in the hustler naked but for white socks wanders around the living room picking up things
the dog is barking at him
the hustler turns and smiles at flan and ouisa
how ya doin
oh my god
the hustler stretches out on the sofa
i got to get some sleep flan tips the sofa hurling the hustler onto the floor
the hustler leaps at flan threateningly
he might have a gun
hustler laughs yeah
i might have a gun
i might have a knife
the hustler raises his hand threateningly
he has a gun
he has a knife
the hustler chases ouisa around the room
flan chases the hustler
the dog chases flan
paul dressed runs in to the living room carrying the hustlers clothes which he hurls down onto the sofa
i can explain
you went out after we went to sleep and picked up this thing
you brought this thing into our house
get out of my house
flan picks up the hustlers clothes and opens the front door
be careful of the pants
take your clothes
go back to sleep in the gutter
flan flings the clothes out into flan pushes the elevator button
the hustler suddenly lunges at flan and grabs flan by the lapels of his bathrobe
the hustler throws flan back violently then picks up his clothes
ouisa runs to flan
flan gasps catching his breath
the elevator door opens
eddie the elevator man is startled by the sight
ouisa is terrified as paul stands at the front door
dont tell my father
i dont want him to know
i havent told him
i got so afraid
my dad coming
i had the money
i went out after we went to sleep and i brought him back
you had so much
i couldnt be alone
i was so afraid
i am so sorry
is everything all right
make sure they go out
i can explain
give me my fifty dollars
i spent it
im so sorry
the hustler is in the elevator pulling on his seedy clothes
make sure they leave
by the back door
paul steps into the elevator
the door shuts
flan and ouisa survey the room
they are at a loss
they straighten out the pillows on the sofa
they are exhausted
the crowd is astonished
and thats that
well its not flan and ouisa survey the living room
i am shaking
you have to do something
is anything gone
how can i look
did he take anything
would you concentrate on yourself
i want to know if anythings gone
we could have been killed
the silver victorian inkwell
how can you think of things
we could have been murdered
flan picks up an ornate victorian inkwell capped by a silver beaver
theres the inkwell
slashed our throats slashed
a framed portrait of a pug
and theres the watercolor
flan pets his dog
go to bed at night happy and then murdered
would we have woken up
they sit on the sofa drained holding onto the phone
the phone suddenly rings
they clutch each other
dont pick it up
geoffrey sits in the back seat of a limousine talking on a cordless portable phone
look ive been thinking
those japs really want the cezanne
you can depend on me for an additional overcall of two fifty
flans rind is boggled
two hundred and fifty thousand
as geoffreys driver takes care of the baggage geoffrey proceeds into the never dropping one beat on his radio phone
and i was thinking for south africa
what about a black american film festival
with this spike lee you have now and of course get poitier down to be the president of the jury and i know cosby and i love this eddie murphy
and my wife went fishing in norway with diana ross and her new norwegian husband
and also they must have some ouisa is trying to hear the other end of the call
it sounds a wonderful idea
geoffrey walks through the terminal
ill call poitier at the sherry no
geoffrey puts the phone down on the security belt
the phone goes through radar
all the while we hear flans voice
the security person impassively watches the phone on the x ray screen
geoffrey picks up the phone as it slides off the band
theyre calling my plane and again last night no need to thank
see you shortly
geoffrey snaps the phone shut sticks it in his pocket and goes into the gate
flan and ouisa look at each other in amazement
as flan hangs up the phone we hear a car door shut as flan and ouisa get in their car
the group from the wedding waves goodbye not at the bride and groom but at flan and ouisa
the bride and groom as a matter of fact are there
thats all we know
and flan and ouisa drive out of the parking lot
the camera pulls back to show flan and ouisa driving back down the taconic parkway
they are more composed now than when they left and even pleased
the radio plays a bach cantata gloria
the camera pulls back further to show them entering new york city via the triborough bridge
the city looks magnificent for a moment from this vantage
below us flan and ouisas car heads for the garage
ouisas hand suddenly flies out of the car window waving at a couple in their forties kitty and larkin crossing the street
flan honks the horn
the camera travels down to kitty and larkin as they glare at the car then smile when they see who it is
do we have a story to tell you
do we have a story to tell you
we cannot tell where we are yet
but ouisa and flan and kitty and larkin lean across a desk and tell a man we will learn shortly is a detective
our two and their son are at harvard together
kitty and larkin are pleased about this
the two couples sit a table in this definitive east side restaurant
let me tell you our story
when did your story happen
we are still zonked
our story happened friday night
so we go first
were going to be in the movies
we are going to be in the movie of cats
ouisa puts down her white wine
you tell your story first
friday night we were home the doorbell rang i am not impressed but it was the son of the detective makes notes
ouisa and flan you got it
the kid was mugged
we had to go out
we left him
he was so charming
his father was taking the red eye
he couldnt get into the hotel till seven an
he stayed with us
she is very pleased
in the middle of the night we heard somebody screaming burglar
we came out in the hall
paul is chasing this naked blonde thief down the corridor
the blonde thief runs out the alarm goes off
the kid saved our lives
that was no burglar
you had another house guest
kitty and larkin laugh
we feel so guilty
paul couldve been killed by that intruder
he was very understanding was anything missing from your house
did you give him money
twenty five dollars until his father arrived
the detective looks at them carefully
flan to the detective we told them our story
have you talked to your kids
cant get through
lets go back to our place
the sound of keys in the door
the door swings open
flan switches on the lights
the two couples run in heading for the phone
id like she gave the name
im not a fan
this is not a fan call
sidney poitier must be registered
his son is a friend of click
the sherrys hung up
the doorbell rings
flan goes to the door
he must be there under another name
another phone call
im not sure how you work
greta garbo used the name harriet brown

everybody must have known she was greta garbo
im trying to find out how one would get in touch with no im not a press agent no im not with anyone my husband
celebrity service doesnt give out information over the phone

flan returns carrying an elaborate arrangement of flowers
flan reads the card
to thank you for a wonderful time
flan reaches into the bouquet
he takes out a p
t of jam
a pot of jam
a pot of jam
they back off as if it might explode
i think we should go to the police
the four approach the precinct on east th street
the detective whom we recognize from earlier looks up from his desk
what are the charges
he came into our house
he cooked us dinner
he told us the story of catcher in the rye
he said he was the son of sidney poitier
flan and ouisa you got it
we dont know
we gave him fifty dollars
we gave him twenty five
he picked up a hustler
he chased the burglar out of our house
he didnt steal anything
we looked and looked
top to bottom
the detective closes his notebook
granted this does not seem major now
were very busy
you cant chuck us out
come up with charges
then ill do something
flan and ouisa have come to a charity do featuring a string quartet playing schubert trio in b flat
but flan and ouisa are not entranced by the music
they stand at the back of the room by the bar telling their story to a group of fascinated friends none of whom was at the wedding as the quartet
these friends are all dressed formally but with the look of people who dress this way every night
there s always one of these going on and theyre always there
yes there is another chapter
our kids came down from harvard
a loud groans of protest and disbelief fill the two of flan and ouisas college aged children woody and tess and kitty and larkins boy ben slump around the room
they are in dismay at ouisa flan kitty and larkin and their story
the details he knew how would he know about the painting
flan has taken the kandinsky off the wall and flipped it around to the wild side
although i think its a very fine kandinsky
flan leans the painting against a chair and studies it
and none of you knows this fellow
he has this wild quality yet a real elegance and a real concern and a real consideration
tess looks at the floral arrangement paul sent
its only slightly wilted
well mom you should have let him stay
you should have divorced all your children and just let this dreamboat stay
plus he sent you flowers
i wish i knew how to get hold of his father
just to see if there is any truth in it
who knows sidney poitier so we could just call him up and ask him
i have a friend who does theatrical law
i bet he what friend
kitty suddenly trapped oh its nobody
i want to know
whatevers going on anywhere i do not want to know
i dont want to know
i dont want to know
ben kitty larkin scream at each other in anguish
tess in a fury leaves the apartment
flan follows her to tess when you see your little sister dont tell her that paul and the hustler used her bed
you put him in that bed
im not going to get involved with any conspiracy
its not a conspiracy
its a family
the elevator door opens
tess and flan virtually growl at each other as the door shuts on tess
flan sees kitty larkin and ben screaming at each other
flan sees ouisa to avoid involvement in the domestic stir hang the kandinsky back on the wall
the geometric ordered side
the alaskan husky barks at the moon
the camera travels out of the park up the face of the fifth avenue apartment once again into the safety of flan and ouisa are in bed asleep
ouisa sits up when she hears someone tapping insistently on the window pane
she looks around the room
paul appears outside on the window ledge wearing the pink shirt
ouisa gets out of bed and opens the window
thats our out
our imagination teaches us our limits and then how to grow beyond those limits
the imagination says listen to me
i at your darkest voice
i am your am voice
i am the voice that wakes you up and says this is what im afraid of
do not listen to me at your peril
the imagination is the noon voice that sees clearly and says yes this is what i want for my life
its there to sort out your nightmare to show you the exit from the maze of your nightmare to transform the nightmare into dreams that become your bedrock
if we dont listen to that voice it dies
paul takes out a switch blade and opens it
the imagination is not our escape
on the contrary the imagination is the place we are all trying to get to
paul lifts his shirt and stabs himself
paul falls over backward into space
the phone rings waking ouisa
flan picks up the phone
ouisa sits up a little stunned
she is relieved to find things so normal
i got a call that might interest you
the string quartet reaches a climax
and a new character entered our story flan and ouisa kitty and larkin come to this hospital across from gracie mansion
fine an earnest professional man in his s comes down the hall and opens his office door
flan ouisa kitty and larkin sit in his office
i was seeing a patient
im an obstetrician at new york hospital
the nurse opened my office door
the nurse a sturdy woman in her s opens the door
theres a friend of your sons here
paul appears looking much as he was when he came to flan and ouisas
pauls shirt front is bleeding
ouisa and flan kitty and larkin are filled with dread
i treated the kid
he was more scared than hurt
a knife wound a few bruises
paul gets off the examining table buttoning his pink shirt
i dont know how to thank you sir
my father is coming here
the two couples sit cramped on the doctors leather sofa
flan and ouisa and kitty and larkin hes making a movie of cats
fine stands by the window looking out at the river
and he told me the name of a matinee idol of my youth
somebody who had really forged ahead and made new paths for blacks just by the strength of his own talent
strangely i had identified with him before i started medical school
i mean im a jew
my grandparents were killed in the war
i had this sense of self hatred of fear
and this kids father the bravery of his films had given me a direction a confidence
simple as that
were always paying off debts
then my beeper went off
a patient in her tenth month of labor
her water finally broke
i gavehim the keys
fine gives paul a set of keys and walks him out into dougs told me all about your brownstone
how you got it at a great price because there had been a murder in it and for a while people thought it had a curse but you were a
scientific man and were courageous
n and ouisa kitty and larkin agree
i ran off to the delivery room
i thought of my son
i dialed my boy at dartmouth
amazingly he was in his room
doing y hat i hate to ask
the call wakens dr
fines son doug
doug grabs for the phone from under the covers
is there someone else in bed with doug
so you accuse me of having no interest in your life not doing for friends being a rotten father
well you should be very happy
the son of who
dad i never heard of him
dad as usual you are a real cretin
you gave him the keys
you gave complete stranger who happens to mention my name the keys to our house
dad sometimes it is so obvious to me why mom left
i am so embarrassed to know you
you gave the keys to a stranger who shows up at your office
mother told me you beat her
mom told me you were a rotten lover and drank so much your body smelled of cheap white wine
mom said sleeping with you was like sleeping with a salad made with bad dressing
why you had to bring me into the world
a girl sits up in bed terrified
there are two sides to every story youre an idiot
youre an idiot
the girl in bed puts pillows over her head
flan and ouisa kitty and larkin lean forward in fascination
i went home
courageously with a policeman
fine puts the key in the door
the cop with him has his gun drawn
fine and the cop enter they hear a debussy quartet playing
paul sits in the living room wearing a silk robe swirling a snifter of brandy listening to the music
paul smiles when he sees dr
fine but when the cop appears with the gun paul rolls over on his side out of the chair
fine snaps off the radio
paul backs up against the wall
breaking and entering
breaking and entering
youre an imposter
officer your honor your eminence dr
fine cave me the keys to his brownstone
isnt that so
my son doesnt know you
this man gave me the keys to the house
isnt that so
the cop puts his gun away
did you give him the key to the house
yes but under false pretenses
this fucking black kid crack addict comes into my office paul cool and forgiving i have taken this much brandy but can pour the rest back into the bottle
and ive used electricity listening to the music but i think youll find that nothings taken from the house
paul takes off the silk robe and neatly places it on the table
i want you to arrest this fraud
paul puts on his jacket and leaves the house
the policeman walks away
doug continues his tirade
no wonder mother left you
doug flings the phone against the wall
flan and ouisa kitty and larkin look at dr
but the two couples are also embarrassed
people from the back row of the concert turn away from the music and listen to ouisa and flan
we went down to the strand five sherlock holmeses ext the strand bookstore th street and broadway day the two couples and dr
fine go into which advertises itself as possessing eight miles of books and that seems an understatement
the camera rushes past rows of books
and then suddenly stops
i found it
ouisas hand reaches up and brings down
a copy of sidney poitiers autobiography this life ouisa reads from the poitier autobiography
the others are enrapt
back in new york with juanita and the children i began to become aware that our marriage while working on some levels was falling apart in other fundamental areas
flan takes the book
theres a picture of him and his four daughters
the books called this life
this kid bulldozing his way into our lives
is we let him in our lives
i run a foundation
youre a dealer
youre a doctor
youd think wed be satisfied with our achievements
the five of them have gone down the street fram the strand to this swell restaurant
agatha christie would ask what do we all have in common
it seems the common thread linking us all is an overwhelming need to be in the movie of cats
struggling through their lives
i dont want to know anything about the spillover of their lives
all we have in common is our children went to boarding school together
flan to dr
fine how come we never met
his mother had custody
i lived out west
after he graduated from high school she moved west
i moved east
i think we should drop it right here
are you afraid ben is mixed up in this fraud
i dont want to know too much about my kid
you think ben is hiding things from us
i tell you im getting to the bottom of this
my son has no involvements with any black frauds
doctor you said something about crack
i dont want to know
it just leaped out of my mouth
oh dear god no proof
well take a vote
do we pursue this to the end no matter what we find out about our kids
i vote yes
i trust doug
kitty looks through the poitier autobiography
listen to the last page
making it better for our children
the truth is what we were protecting those little people from
there is a lot to worry about and id better start telling the little bastards start worrying
kitty closes the book in dismay
ouisa flan larkin and dr
fine are each lost in thought
flan and ouisa dressed formally the way people used to dress for the opera stand at the small champagne bar outside the boxes
their similarly dressed friends are engrossed in the tale
we all went up to harvard
we had to enlist our children flan and ouisa kitty and larkin and dr
fine cut through the harvard yard at an urgent pace
the five parents sit in the empty dining commons
theyve come for lunch
and now lunch is over
tess woody ben and doug sit on the other side of the refectory table glaring at their parents lunch trays between the generations
students walk in and out
the parents speak in hushed library size whispers to avoid any echo
its somebody you went to high school with since you go to different colleges
i just want to tell you how i appreciate your coming today dad
dougs voice echoes
he knows the details about our lives
who in your high school part of your gang has become homosexual or is deep into drugs
thats like about fifteen people
tess enjoys her echo because it makes flan and ouisa uncomfortable
i dont want to know
i find it really insulting that you would assume that it has to be a guy
this movie stars son could have had a relationship with a girl in and ben is just as loud
thats your problem in a nut shell
youre so limited
flan and ouisa try to shush them
thats why im going to afghanistan
to climb mountains
you are not climbing mountains
we have not invested all this money in you to scale the face of k
tess leans across the table matching them whisper for whisper
is that all i am
track down everybody in your high school class
not just homosexuals
the kid might be a drug dealer
doug throws back his chair
why do you look at me when you say that
do you think im an addict
a drug pusher
i really resent the accusations
no one is accusing you of anything
larkin gets up and paces around the table
i dont want to know
i dont want to know
i dont want to know
nobody is accusing anyone of anything
im asking you to go on a detective search and find out from your high school class if anyone has met a black kid pretending to be a movie stars
he promised you parts in cats
it wasnt just that
it was fun
you went to cats
you said it was an all time low in a lifetime of theater going
film is a different medium
you said aeschylus did not invent theater to have it end up a bunch of chorus kids wondering which of them will go to kitty kat heaven
i dont remember saying that
no i think that was starlight express well maybe hell make a movie of starlight express and you can all be on roller skates
the kids stand up
this is so humiliating
this is so pathetic
this is so racist
this is not racist
the kids stride out of the dining hall into their parents run ahead trying to circle them
how can i get in touch with anybody in high school
ive outgrown them
now can you outgrow them
you graduated a year ago
the parents stop in front of blocking tess and doug and bens escape
ouisa takes a red book out of her bag and brandishes at them
here is a copy of your yearbook
i want you to get the phone numbers of everybody in your class
you all went to the same boarding school
you can charge it to my phone
call everyone in your class and ask them if they know the three kids try to break through the blockade
this is the kgb
youre on the phone all the time
now i ask you to make calls all over the country and you become reticent
this is the entire mccarthy period
woody saunters up to his parents
he is very cool
flan and ouisa smile at his sweet attitude
i just want to get one thing straight
finally we hear from the peanut gallery
and woody screams at them in rage his voice echoing mindless of the students who freeze in the background as you would at a traffic accident
you gave him my pink shirt
you gave a complete stranger my pink shirt
that pink shirt was a christmas present from you
i treasured that shirt
i loved that shirt
my collar size has grown a full size from weight lifting
and you saw my arms had grown you saw my neck had grown
and you bought me that shirt for my new body
i loved that shirt
the first shirt for my new body
and you gave that shirt away
i cant believe it
i hate this life
i hate you
woodys wrath grows and grows and drives ouisa and flan indeed all the parents out of the serene venerable harvard building onto the street
passersby stop and gape
woody doesnt care
you never do anything for me
youve never done anything but tried to block me
im only this pathetic extension of your eighth rate personality
social darwinism pushed beyond all limits
you gave away my pink shirt
you want me to be everything you werent
you said drugs and looked at me
the parents go down the street speechless defeated
pages of a yearbook turning
the pages stop
the four kids look through their high school yearbook
tess spots a face
they all consider
trent is weasel faced
very hard to read
not quite looking into the yearbook photographers camera
look at those beady eyes staring out at me
hes at mit
tess has come down to new york with news for her mother
so i went to mit
he was there in his computer room and i just pressed him and pressed him and pressed him
i had this strapped to me
tess puts a small tape recorder on the desk
tess turns it on
ouisa listens to the tape
yes i knew paul
the camera focusses in on her thigh
we can see the slight bump where tess has strapped the recorder
trent looks up from his bank of computers at tess
trents pinched face looks as if it has never known one truly happy day
but what happened between you
paul dressed in ragged clothes stands huddled in a doorway to get out of the freezing rain
trent passes by the doorway
trent is gone
then trent reappears and stares at paul
paul stands against the white wall weve seen earlier
jazz playing somewhere
paul unlike the elegant paul we have seen is dressed in torn jeans a ripped tank top dirty high top sneakers
this is the paul we first saw
paul looks at trent with a mixture of contempt and i dare you
paul stretches out on the bed
he pulls out a thick address book from under him
street talk speech
hardly what weve heard
my address book
trent tries to take the address book away from paul
all these names
tell me about these people
trent lies along side paul
this is where i wanted you to be
paul hypnotised by the address book slaps trent away from him and gets out of the bed
tell me about these people man
i just want to look at you
are these all rich people
trent sits up in bed
hand to mouth on a higher plateau
ouisa looks at the tape recorder horrified at this judgement
how long did trent keep paul
tess shushes ouisa
paul paces around the room looking into this book
i think it must be very hard to be with rich people
you have to have money
you have to give them presents
not at all
rich people do something nice for you you give them a pot of jam
thats what pots of jam are for
they have entire stores filled with fancy pots of jam wrapped in cloth
ill tell you what ill do
i pick a name
you tell me about them
where they live
and for each name you get a piece of clothing
paul picks a name at random circling his finger and plunging into the address book
talbot and woodrow
talbot called tess was anorexic and was in a hospital for a while
paul takes off a shoe and kicks it to trent
now its tesss turn to be hurt
ouisa comforts tess
ouisa and flan for flanders kittredge
rhode island i believe
newport but not along the ocean
the street behind the ocean
hes an art dealer
they have a kandinsky
a kan what ski
a double sided kandinsky
paul kicks off his other shoe
ouisa and tess look up at the kandinsky hanging geometric side front
trent catches pauls sneaker joyously
i feel like scheherazade
trent embraces paul with fierce tenderness
maybe trent had one happy day and this is it
i dont want you to leave me paul
ill go through my address book and tell you about family after family
you never not fit in again
well give you a new ideas it
ill make you the most eagerly sought after young man in the east
and then ii come into one of these homes one day and youll be there and ill be presented to you
and ill pretend to meet you for the first time and our friendship will be witnessed by my friends our parents friends
if it all happens under their noses they cant judge me
they cant disparage you
ill make you a guest in their houses
ask me another name
id like to try for the shirt
paul kisses trent
thats enough for today
paul takes his shoes and the address book and goes
ouisa brushes tesss hair as they listen
paul stayed with me for three months
paul leans against the white wall
paul frowns then smiles
all ready paul has begun to change from a street kid to someone quite preppy very ralph lauren
only on the surface
hes still learning
this is the way you must speak
hear my accent
hear my voice
never say youre going horse back riding
you say youre going riding
and dont say couch
and you say bodd ill
say bottle of beer
bodd ill a bee ya
bottle of beer
bodd ill a bee ya
bodd ill a bee ya
bodd ill a bee ya
bottle of beer
paul bows to trent
trents face is transfigured with joy
trent smiles at tess but the smile is one of tight lipped stoicism
we went through the address book letter by letter
paul vanished by the ls
he took the address book with him
well hes already been in all your houses
maybe i will meet him again
i sure would like to
trent stands up signalling an end to the conversation
he turns off his computers
his real name
i dont know anything about him
it was a rainy night in boston
he was in a doorway
he took stuff from you
besides the address book
he took my stereo and sport jacket and my word processor and my laser printer
and my skis
and my tv
will you press charges
its a felony
why do they want to find him
they say to help him
if theres a crime the cops will get involved
look we must keep in touch
we were friends for a brief bit in school
i mean we were really good friends
wont you press charges
tess leans forward and snaps off the tape recorder
ouisa is amazed
flan and ouisa have brought their friends up to date
paul learned all that in three months
the chimes ring signalling the start of the opera
who would have thought it
trent conway the henry higgins of our time
the group laughs and finishes their drinks as the usher unlocks the door to the group proceeds in deciding wholl sit where in the box and checking their programs
ouisa looks into the vastness of the metropolitan opera house
the chandeliers are rising into the ceiling
quick what the hell is the story of this opera
flan adjusts his opera glasses
a boy meets girl
boy loses girl
ouisa is distracted
paul must have looked at all those names and said i am columbus
i am magellan
i will sail into this new world
the camera comes in on ouisa as she remembers tess laughs
its a nice moment between these two
i read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people
six degrees of separation
between us and everybody else on this planet
the president of the united states
gondolier in venice
fill in the names
i find that a
tremendously comforting that were so close and b
like chinese water torture that were so close
because you have to find the right six people to make the connection
its not just big names
a native in a rain forest
a tierra del fuegan
i am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people
its a profound thought
how paul found us
how to find the man whose son he pretends to be
or perhaps j his son although i doubt it
how every person is a new door opening up into other worlds
six degrees of separation between me and everyone else on this planet
but to find the right six people
tess kisses her mother
ouisa puts out the light and they leave the room
the act one music of puccinis tosca suddenly swells up and ouisa looks out the window down into the park
the husky bays up at the moon
the curtain comes down on act one of tosca
sandy and connie yes
pram the wedding have leaned over from the next box
he just vanished
they pass out of the box into everyone is very cheery
we are going to rome
connie gives ouisa a card with a name on it
ouisa reads the card and passes it to flan
i dont know them
flan smiles when he sees the card
always wanted to meet them
of course wel call
as soon as we get to rome
the camera floats high across the city heading for st
it descends circling st
peters rome is always remarkable but to see columns flash past
the blurring clears and we are moving with flan and ouisa
they are escorted through a maze of scaffolding by an elderly italian art dealer
the sistine chapel like this
to stand at the very top on scaffolding
flan and ouisa ride up through the scaffolding in a rickety elevator
we were at the opera and ran into them and they gave us your address
this is staggering
they step out in great excitement right onto they restored it after all these years four italian workers scrub away at the ceiling a few feet above them
they refer constantly to banks of computers operated by two japanese
scraped all this paint off it and years of smoke and tourists and its brand new
ouisa looks up
she is right beneath the hand of god touching the hand of man
she looks at it in awe
to be this close to it
the screen is filled with the cleaned ceiling of the sistine chapel
flan and ouisa sit on cushions of a soho loft done in the most glamorous minimal japanese mode
the colors are vibrant
flan went for business but for me it was the owners of this loft are a man s who is confined to a wheel chair and his beautiful companion an
elegant japanese woman
the ten dinner guests are dressed all in black except ouisa who has on a bright chanel suit
she and flan have managed to capture stage center
but what happened
its not important you must
well the day we got back from rome we stepped out of the taxi from the airport and flan steps out of the cab first
our doorman whom we tip very well at christmas and any time he does something nice for us our doorman spits at my husband j
i mean spit at him
the doorman frank good faithful loyal frank holds the door open and spits at flan
the crowd gasps
flan frowns at ouisa for telling this part
darling they dont have to know every detail
ouisa is afraid to come out of the cab
i know all about your son
what about my son
not the little shit who lives here
the other son
the secret son
the negro son you deny
the negro son
the black son you make live in central park while youre gallivanting around rome
the doorman spits at flan again
the japanese hostess is interested
you have a black son
the cops brought this young girl to us
the cops called us up and we went down to the precinct again
the detective sits on the edge of his desk
ouisa and flan sit in chairs in the small office looking on uncomfortably
the emotion in the shabby room is too big for the size of it
they watch a young woman named elizabeth in her mid s seated behind the detectives desk
elizabeth in a rage i want him dead
thats all i want
ouisa leans forward at the dinner table
the next chapter
the party is silenced
my boy friend and i took a picnic into the park rick elizabeth and paul sprawl out on the grass in the sun under the statue of the alaskan husky
the remains of a picnic around them
bongo drums play in the distance
and we met this guy and started singing and talking
rick a nice young guy in his mid twenties plays his guitar energetically the three of them having a great time singing a cheery old rock song
paul is wearing the pink shirt and the khakis but looks pretty seedy
he eats hungrily
i was hallucinating from not eating if i told people back home that new york had trees and picnics theyd swear i was lying
i love new york so much
look at it
i cant get over it
were here from utah
do they have any black people in utah
i saw them once
two black people
yes the mormons brought in two
they all laugh enjoying each other the day the meeting
we came here to be actors
she won the all state competition for comedy and drama
elizabeth stands up and declaims
the quality of mercy is not strained
it droppeth like the gentle rain from heaven
shes not bad
but then she giggles and the shakespearean effect crumbles
and we study and we wait tables
because you have to have technique
elizabeth and rick are very earnest
like the painters
cezanne looked for the rules behind the spontaneity of impressionism
cez thats a painter
we dont know anything about painting
my dad loves painting
he has a kandinsky but he loves cezanne the most
he lives up there
paul points up at fifth the home of the kittredges
he lives up there
count six windows over
john flanders kittredge
his chums call him flan
i was the child of flans hippie days
his radical days
he went down south as a freedom marcher to register black voters his friends were killed
met my mother
registered her and married her in a fit of sentimental righteousness and knocked her up with me and came back here and abandoned her
went to harvard
hes now a fancy art dealer
lives up there
count six windows over
wont see me
the new wife the white wife the louisa kittredge call me ouisa wife the mother of the new children wife your brothers and sisters
they go to andover and exeter and harvard and yale
the awful thing is my father started out good
my mother says there is a good man inside s j
hell see you if he is that good
he cant forget you entirely
i call him
he hangs up
go to his office he doesnt have an office
he works out of there
they wont even let me in the elevator
dress up as a messenger
say you have a masterpiece for him
i got the mona lisa waitin out in the truck
i dont want to embarrass him
look this is so fucking tacky
you love each other
a a lot
rick and elizabeth touch each others hands
paul standing up to go i hope we can meet again
where do you live
paul looks around him and makes a hopeless grand gesture
paul picks up two plastic shopping bags which are filled with clothing
youre not out on the streets
youre such assholes
where would i live
paul shrugs his shoulders and leaves
rick and elizabeth look at each other then follow him down the path leading through the park to the carousel
the carousel calliope plays merrily
stay with us
we just have a railroad flat in a tenement paul looks at a bank of daffodils planted by the carousel
he begins picking a bouquet of daffodils
rick and elizabeth are being as persuasive as they can
its over a roller disco
the last of the roller discos but its quiet by five am and a great narrow space a railroad loft and we could give you a corner
the tubs in the kitchen but theres light in and he did
rick and elizabeths tenement is disastrously crummy and probably violates every building code
but yes light does flow in through that one narrow window
paul puts the bouquet of daffodils into a jelly jar and sets it down on a board that covers the tub
elizabeth composes herself
ouisa pours elizabeth a glass of water
he stayed for a few weeks
he taught us so much
we even thought he was the reason for coming to new york
he opened up a new world for us
thats all anybody wants isnt it
a new world
ouisa looks at flan
rick and elizabeth listen intently to paul
this is the way you must speak
hear my accent
hear my voice
never say youre going horse back riding
you say youre going riding
and dont say couch
and you say bodd ill
say bottle of beer
bodd ill a bee ya
elizabeth pokes around in the refrigerator
she discovers two bottles of beer hello hello
she opens the beers
paul regards rick for a moment
paul takes the bottle of beer
rick and elizabeth share the other
bottle of beer
and never be afraid of rich people
you know what they love
a fancy pot of jam
get yourself a patron
thats what you need
you shouldnt be waiting tables
youre going to wake up one day and the temporary job you picked up to stay alive is going to be your full time life
elizabeth is struck by his advice and embraces paul gratefully
elizabeth is more pulled together sipping her drink of water
flan takes ouisas hand
rick and elizabeth have made love and lay on their backs in bed and dream
ill tell you all the parts i want to play
vanya in uncle vanya
masha in three sisters
id like a elizabeth is on fire with happiness and unwittingly cuts off no irina first
the young one who yearns for love
id like a shot at then masha who loves
id like a shot then the oldest one olga who never knows love
rickwaits to see that elizabeth is through then id like a shot at laertes
i think its a much better part
elizabeth gazes in a mirror that she holds close to her face
do you think itll hurt me
whatll hurt you
my resemblance to liv ullmann
paul runs into the loft
he wrote me
i wrote him and he wrote me back
hes going to give me a thousand dollars
and thats just for starters
he sold a cezanne to the japanese and made millions and he can give me money without her knowing it
paul lets out a whoop and leaps up onto the bed with rick and elizabeth in it and begins jumping up and down
i knew it
paul goes to a corner which contains a single mattress on the floor and begins to pack his few things back in the plastic bags
im moving out of here
elizabeth reaches for her robe and pulls it on
rick pulls on his jeans
rick and elizabeth surround paul to make him stay
paul hugs them
but i am going to give you the money to put on a showcase of any play you want and youll be in it and agents will come see you
and youll be seen and youll be started
and when you win your oscars both of you youll look in the camera and thank me elizabeth loves the moment and weeps her acceptance speech
i want to thank paul kittredge
they all hug each other and thats real
im going to meet him in maine
hes up there visiting his parents in dark harbor
my grandparents whom ive never met
hes finally going to tell my grandparents about me
hes going to make up for lost time
hes going to give me money
i can go back home

how am i going to get to maine
the wife checks all the bills
he has to account for the money
she handles the purse strings
where the hell am i going to get two hundred and fifty dollars to get to maine
how long would you need it for
ill be gone a week
but i could wire it back to you
paul goes into the john to take his toothbrush and razor
elizabeth pulls on her dress and straightens out her hair
we could lend it to him for a week
if something happens youre like his stepmother
these women holding on to all the purse strings
we worked too hard to save that
paul comes out of the john
rick always laid back is suddenly quite angry
we just cant
ill meet you both after work
if your father loves you hell get you the ticket up there
itll work out
stand up straight
attitudes of defeat
elizabeth kisses paul and looks at sullen rick and leaves
she was one of those armies of young people who come to new york filled with dreams and end up on a treadmill working and working just to stay alive
elizabeth is one of the few waitresses in this crowded bar and works very hard
elizabeth gapes at the information on the screen
elizabeth begins hitting the machine to get her card back
elizabeth picks up the phone on the machine and calls the emergency number
elizabeth in phone theres some mistake
it says my joint account can you see the numbers on the screen thats right
thats my name
and his name
what do you mean
who closed the account
who took everything out of the account
who did this
give me my card back
the guy next in line nudges her
let somebody else in here
an hysterical elizabeth goes into frank the doorman is having a snooze
elizabeth shakes him
he wakes up terrified at the sight of this hysterical creature over him
people named kittredge
this kittredge guy has a black son he makes live in the park mr
kittredge has what
his black son took money from me you have to be quiet i want to get up to see them
youll have to call or write a letter they owe me money
frank takes elizabeth by the arm and ushers her out of frank the doorman bolts the front door to the building
elizabeth bangs on the door
im here trying to get to meet people
i am stranded
who do i know to go to
i want my money
i work tables
i work hard
a cab pulls up
a posh couple steps out of the cab to go into fifth
they look at elizabeth
the quality of mercy is not strained
fuck you quality of mercy
frank opens the door quickly
the posh couple scoots in
elizabeth kicks the building
flan and ouisa have come to this broadway italian restaurant after the theater with a man and woman who from their dress and manner are obviously in the theater andrew
flan and ouisa are in mid story
all over the building that i had abandoned some mistake of my past in central park
the couple gasps
but its too fantastic
cant you just see me marching down south for freedom now
yes i can
it was so embarrassing
it wasnt so embarrassing
i bet flan loves being outraged
flan mock outrage i dont
flan loves getting into high dudgeon
his cheeks go all rosy
look at his cheeks
dudgeon becomes him
they all laugh as the waitress puts down the plates of food
to high dudgeon
they all toast
but ouisa has stopped laughing
elizabeth sits up in bed in the dark
she impassively watches a rat scramble across the floor
rick comes in drained dressed in a baby blue tuxedo with a ruffled blue shirt the kind of tux worn at high school proms
elizabeth puts on the light
wheres the money
ouisa continues her tale
she understandably wanted to know
rick laughs brightly and sits beside her on the bed
let me explain
paul found some extra money of his own and he wanted to thank us for staying here
he wouldve treated you but you had to work or else we wouldve
we rented these tuxedos
isnt it a gas
hes going to give us the money back
and then im going to take you to the rainbow room
thats where we went
i brought you matches
rick in his ruffled blue tux and paul in impeccable black tie look into the rainbow room
the captain takes them to a table by the window
rick and paul look out over the city
the view is magic
now did we get this table
stick with me baby
i know the right name to drop
rick laughs brightly and its not that expensive for what you get
well its not a bargain but its the waiter opens a bottle of champagne
how an i going to explain to elizabeth about the money
paul tastes the champagne
the waiter pours
shell have it back
thats what you call the taste of the wine
and i believe that wine from the even numbered years is generally the superior to the odd numbered years
although its just a theory cheers
you are just about the greatest the dance orchestra plays a salute to s romance
do you want to dance
elizabeth has never seen anything l e here
i wish she was
who do we dance with
the orchestra segues into a tango
every moment in life is a learning experience or what good is it
then let this bunch of jerks see class
flan nods for their dinner guests andrew and jeannie
a little bit of titillation
high over new york city
rick and paul go to the dance floor and begin to dance paul leading
rick loving it
rick tries to laugh it up into a wild experience
elizabeth sits impassively
i swear nothing like this ever happened in utah
at first people dont notice rick and paul dancing
then people do notice
and ill tell you nothing like that must have ever happened at the rainbow room because they asked us to leave
it was so funny
paul spins rick round and round and the camera spins with youll love the place
its up so high
the camera spins around the panoramic view sixty five floors and then spins out of the windows down onto the camera focusses in on a couple spinning in the middle
of the ice
rick and paul hysterical with laughter cut through rockefeller center and then come to fifth avenue where a hansom carriage waits
the driver tips his hat to these customers
paul jumps into we dont have any money amigo
when will you learn
money is one commodity you can always get
the hansom carriage proceeds up to central park
rick leans forward looking out the isinglass windows
im going to have to explain to elizabeth about the money and calm her
she gets so nervous paul draws a circle on ricks back
hey stop that
i was wondering if i could fuck you
then sees paul is serious
i dont do things like that
thats what makes it so nice
rick reaches over and turns off the light by the bedside
downstairs we hear the throb beginning of the roller disco
elizabeth looks at him coldly
and he did and it was fantastic
time has passed
paul kisses an amazed mussed rick on the mouth and jumps out of the carriage and goes off into the dark
the driver stands up seeing paul run out
rick runs out of the carriage after paul
the driver chases them
rick lost in the nighttime park
rick looks up and sees the statue of the husky
rick paces back and forth
didnt we come here for experience
we can use this
elizabeth lies on her stomach on the bed away from him
elizabeth rolls a pencil back and forth on the desk
flan and ouisa watch sympathetically
he rambled on for hours
his own father warned me rick was a fool and i looked at rick and knew his father was right
rick paces back and forth in a rage pulling at his tux
my father is not right
i cant have him be right
i wanted experience
we came here for experience
whats so wrong with that
elizabeth is repelled by him
dont touch me
elizabeth rubs her hands over her face as if trying to get the memory away
ouisa looks at flan and the detective
he went on for a long time trying to get me just to look at him
i couldnt even do that
but i didnt come here to do this or lose that or be this or do this to you
not to you
look at me
what did i let him do to me
nobody did this but you
now the amazing part is talk about six degrees we were in the roller disco that night
andrew and jeannies jaws drop
there we were roller skating for heart disease or cancer it was illiteracy
middle aged people all dolled up roll skate around and around trying to keep their balance to s swing music
among the skaters we spot flan and ouisa at this roller disco benefit skating round and round breathlessly going faster and faster laughing and laughing
lights flash and whirl
i hadnt skated in i hate to tell you how many we came outside giddy and reeling lights reflect in a puddle on the wet street
the camera pulls back to reveal it is a puddle of blood seeping out of a crumpled body
the body must have just landed there in a clump because the blood seeping out had not yet reached the gutter
the blood just oozing out slowly towards the curb
flan and ouisa and another couple sandy and connie from the wedding stop at the sight
they stare at the body that has slammed into the pavement
the body of rick
the boy had jumped from above
we just missed it by minutes
perhaps we could have saved him called an ambulance but it was too late he couldve landed on us
andrew and jeannie are appalled
its so funny you say that
yesterday we walked through the park by gracie mansion and it was cold and we saw police putting a jacket on a man sitting on a bench
only we got closer and it wasnt a jacket
it was a body bag
a homeless person had frozen during the night
was it that cold
sometimes there are periods where you see death everywhere
flan waves to someone over there
the waitress brings coffees
ouisa looks straight ahead
ouisa and flan sit with the detective and elizabeth
when this young lady told me the black kid was your son it all seemed to come into place
what im saying is shell press charges
i want paul dead
he took all our money
he took my life
you bet your life ill press charges
we havent seen him since that night
we might have a case
a how do we find him
well trap him
ill release it to the papers
i can call the new york times
i have friends
theyll publish the story
someone will see it
and turn him in
well find paul
ouisa looks at flan
flan is so secure
flan in his bathrobe opens the door and picks up the morning paper
t he scans through the paper then lets out a whoop and runs through the apartment to new york times article entitled who says new yorkers dont have a heart
ouisa is making a breakfast drink at the blender
flan reading from the times smart sophisticated tough new yorkers such as j
flanders kittredge who opened their homes and pocket books to a young man learned yesterday they had been boondoggled by a confidence man now wanted by police flan pounds the
kitchen counter in glee
ouisa looks at him askance
the fountain shoots up
the camera drifts up the face of the state theatre
flan and ouisa are out on the terrace in
mid story talking to a couple alex and lily who are there with a young girl who is obviously an aspiring ballerina
i didnt see that piece

ouisa and flan get out of a taxi in front of this gothic cathedral
they see kitty and flan running down the street to the same destination
ouisa and flan walk down the aisle with kitty and larkin

black tie auction sothebys flan leans in close to kitty
we are bidding tonight on an henri matisse
they cut down a side aisle
its a second level matisse but a matisse who are you buying it for
an organ suddenly begins playing a triumphant bach cantata

ouisa turns to look up at the choir loft
then its the germans
theyll go as high as dont tell all the family secrets well over million
out of which you will keep not that much in this new market
bring back the s
ill have to give most of it away but the good part is it gives me a credibility in this new market

our south african ouisa shushes flan
they have arrived at ouisa and flan are part of the group in this stone gothic chamber witnessing the baptism of the infant child of two friends of theirs

one country at a time
you are not getting married
immediately so deeply negative i know everyone you know and you are not marrying any of them
the arrogance that you would assume you know everyone i know
the way you say it i know everyone you know in the background flan shaves at the bathroom mirror
unless you met them in the last two days you cant hold a secret
the other line rings wait im putting you on hold no one ever calls on that number
lights flash on the glass of this unspecified location
paul frightened is on a street phone and dressed as he was when trent first met him ragged scared
we will cut back and forth between these two locations for the remainder of this scene
at times the two will share the screen
during this scene ouisa walks throughout the apartment speaking on the cordless phone
i saw the story in the paper
i didnt know the boy killed himself

youre ahead of me there
have you seen the sistine chapel
even gone to the top of it in a rickety elevator to watch the men clean it
youve been to the top of the sistine chapel
paul leans into the phone amazed as the screen floods with the brightly colored ceiling of the ouisa and flan stand on the top of a rickety platform
the woriockn slaps it
stood right under the hand of god touching the hand of man
its only a fresco
ouisa looks up at the hand of god
she laughs and slaps the hand of god
paul smiles in wonderment as the screen fills with color
but then were out of his imagination and see the squalid surroundings of his phone booth
you slapped gods hand
i slapped gods clean hand
and you know what they clean it with
all this technology
q tips and water
paul is thrilled by this bit of knowledge
clean away the years of grime and soot and paint ovens
q tips and water changing the history of western art

paul they think you might have murdered someone

flan appears needing help with his studs
honey could you give me a hand with ouisa mouths to flan its paul

flan picks it up
we were cut off

flan mouths where is he
paul straining to hear gets very paranoid

flan thrusts the phone back to ouisa
i said hi to flan
i was helpful last time thank him he was very help ouisa hands flan the phone
you were helpful getting me that money for the cezanne

paul beams as he becomes the paul from that night
his imagination is off and running
the lights from wherever he is shine on his face and reflect on the broken glass of the booth

late s mrs
ouisa and flan are here
this dinner is really a state occasion in honor of that united nations type at mrs
but flan and ouisa have captured the table
t the story ended there
it did not
clearly ouisa is as disturbed by the telling of the events as flan is energized
there are so many other people here tonight
we didnt mean to take up so much mrs
bannister slams her napkin down
its my supper and i command you to sing
we called our new best friend the detective
we told them paul was at the waverly theater
flan to his dinner partner sixth avenue and third street
but we had promised paul that we would bring him to the police
we told the police he was special
well ouisa did
the detective said hed honor our promise
we skipped the cocktails but we didnt count on ouisa and flan in dinner clothes are stuck in a traffic jam
traffic traffic traffic flan gets out of the car and looks ahead in this din of honking horns
flan and ouisa speed up sixth avenue and double park in front of the waverly movie theater
two cop cars are there
red lights spinning
people gape on the street
they see paul being dragged into one of the two cop cars t kicking and screaming
the cops throw paul into the back seat
flan tries to talk to one of the police while ouisa runs up to the cop car window
paul being handcuffed looks at ouisa
he smiles as if hes bumped into duisa at a cocktail party
the kandinsky is painted on both sides
duisa is startled
the cop slams the car door on paul
let me go with you i promised id take him
out of the way flan takes ouisas arm
we have to do soaething
lets just get the hell out of here
the cop car pulls away sirens blaring
paul turns and looks at ouisa
theres nothing more you can do what could we do
went to the precinct
duisa hands the detectives card to the desk clerk
hes been handling this hes transferred this is about an arrest made yesterday at the waverly movie theater the clerk checks the records
this precinct didnt do any business at the waverly theater
i didnt imagine it im not saying you did
could you find out which precinct the clerk looks through the book
hes a young black man
or maybe kittredge
i dont know the exact name are you family
but the detective promised me yesterday that i could go with the young man when he was arraigned to let them know he was special
we have no record of it
some other precinct must have made the arrest
it sounds like your special friend was wanted for something else
lady how can i help you
you dont even know your friends name
we can find anybody six degrees the clerk closes the book
we werent family
we didnt know pauls name
i went to the district attorneys office
we werent family
we didnt know pauls name
i called the criminal courts
i wasnt family
i didnt know pauls name
you see i read today that a young man committed suicide in rikers island
tied a shirt around his neck and hanged himself
was it the pink shirt
this burst of color
the pink shirt
was it paul
we never found out who he was
im sure its not him
isnt it amazing
hell be back
we havent heard the last of him
hell find a way
could we talk about something else
our guest of honor tonight its such a pleasure to meet you but
the guest of honor from the un leans forward
why does it mean so much to you
he wanted to be us
everything we are in the world this paltry thing our life he wanted it
he stabbed himself to get into our lives
he envied us
were not enough to be envied
like the papers said
we have hearts
having a heart is not the point
we were hardly taken in
we believed him for a few hours
he did more for us in a few hours than our children ever did
he wanted to be your child
dont let that go
he sat out in that park and said that man is my father
hes in trouble and we dont know how to help him
he couldve killed me
the guests agree
you were attracted to him flan throws down his napkin in mock outrage
almogj mock outrage
cut me out of that pathology
you are on your own attracted by youth and his talent and the embarrassing prospect of being in the movie version of cats
did you put that in your times piece
and we turn him into anecdote to dine out on
as we are right now
but it was an experience
i will not turn him into an anecdote
how do we fit what happened to us into life without turning it into an anecdote with no teeth and a punch line well mouth over and over for years
tell the story about the imposter who came into our lives that reminds me of the time this boy
and we become these human juke boxes spilling out these anecdotes
but it was an experience
how do we keep the experience
ouisa looks around the dinner table
the guests have decided to start on their dinners
flan to his dinner partner thats why i love paintings
the problems he brought up are the problems painters are still dealing with
those are problems
ouisa to herself there is color in my life but im not aware of any structure
what are you saying darling
ouisa looks at flan clinically
flan frowns and turns back to his dinner partner brightly
cezanne would leave blank spaces in his canvasses if he couldnt account for the brush stroke give a reason for the color
then i am a collage of unaccounted for brush strokes
i an all random
ouisa stands up from the dinner table
her chair scrapes
there is an embarrassed rush
bannister an order sit down
ouisa leaves the dinner table
ouisa pushes the elevator button
flan comes into the hall
what kind of behavior is god flan how much of your life can you account for
the elevator door opens
do you realize how important this woman is
she steps in the elevator
they descend in silence not wanting a scene in front of the the operator
the elevator door opens into the lobby
flan follows ouisa through the lobby
are you drunk
what are you unhappy about
the cezanne sale vent through
the matisse went through
we are rich
next month theres a bonnard and after that these are the times i would take a knife and dig out your heart
how much of your life can i account for
i am a gambler
ouisa smiles at the simplicity of her realization
were a terrible match
ouisa steps out onto flan following ouisa she is a very important woman
i am hoping to do business
did you see the paintings on her walls
she might want to sell
she flan glares at her and turns back into the lobby and returns to the party
ousia moves to follow flan then walks up park avenue lost agitated unsure
ouisa walks on remembering ouisas hand completes the action
ouisa slaps the frescoed ceiling of the sistine chapel
ouisa slaps the hand of god
