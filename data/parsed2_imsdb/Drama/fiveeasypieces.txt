written beneath elizabeth partita dupea th photo the above family group seated on the porch of the dupea home
all eyes but isabelles are faced toward the camera
she beams upon a year old asleep in her arms his head resting against her bosom
his figure is encircled by the pens marking and preceding his name is the configuration of a small heart robert eroica dupea a year old bobby sits in a chair
his feet dangling in absent minded rhythm to a chamber piece played by his father his two brothers and his sister
close on a metronome marking a slow etude rhythm
the camera moves from it to bobby on the piano bench beside his mother
as she patiently demonstrates the etude for him he places a thumb in his mouth and leans against her arm
on the metronome at an andante rhythm
carl and tita now in their teens are seated side by side on the piano bench playing four hands with dazzling virtuosity
the camera moves from them to a framed newspaper article on the music room wall
below a photograph of a year old young man are the words herbert kreutzer dupea seattles youngest guest conductor
bobby at wearing a dress suit
his mother combs his hair with maternal concentration
close up of a program announcing a dupea family recital

like as a lovelorn turtle hendel sung by isabelle dupea
rondo alla turca mozart played by elizabeth dupea
piano sonata opus beethoven played by herbart dupea
the camera comes to rest on five easy pieces grebner played by robert dupea
five easy pieces played haltingly over the torsos of a line of people moving slowly down the chapel aisle
shows a solemn procession of the above filing by an open casket holding isabelle dupea
the camera pans from nicholas seated on the aisle to the four adult children seated next to him and comes to rest on bobby
his gaze is cast down to his lap as he refuses to look at the pale profile of his mothers face resting within the satin folds of the casket lining
as the last of the family friends pay their respect nicholas steps out into the aisle and followed by tita carl and herbert moves down toward the casket
bobby rises from his seat and makes his way toward the aisle where he hesitates briefly then turns and walks up the aisle and out the chapel doors
the toothed bucket of a back hoe trenches into the earth then lifts up into the air revealing bobby in hard hat and heavy gloves operating the levers
as the hoe swings off to the side and deposits a load of earth into the rear of a truck
a series of shots begins showing bobby and a fellow hard hat elton engaged in the dirty and dangerous task of working crew with a team of tool pushers on
the derricks of signal hill
functioning as servants of the well and its pumps the pull rods make and break joints on the rig floor weld tubing carry pipes climb the tour and play the
dozens on beer wagon breaks
bobby still in his hard hat as he drives
out through the window the derricks of the hill can be seen their night work lights on
following on the car as it moves off the hill into the seamy districts adjacent to it passing by fast food joints liquor stores all night porno parlors and neon
as he stares out through the windshield his eyes distant dwelling in an oblivion that blanks both the present and past
the car pulls onto a low rent residential street and comes to a stop in front of a small bungalow
bobby exits the car moves up the walkway to the house and disappears inside
bobby seated on the couch a can of beer in hand staring morosely across the room to playing the song and if you love him oh be proud of him
for after all hes just a man
in a waitresss uniform with a bowl of beer nuts
after placing them on the coffee table in front of him she leans down and kisses him
challenged by a less than reciprocal response she kisses him more fervently
as she moves her lips from his ear to his neck he lifts the can to his mouth and drinks
stand by your man and show the world you love him keep giving all the love you can stand by your man
the song concludes and setting aside her ardor for the moment arky accent im gonna play it again
as she starts for the stereo he takes hold of her hand
youre not going to play it again
well lemme play the other side then
again he prevents her from moving to the stereo and pulls her down onto the couch
now quit bobby
you said youre goin a help me pick a song
well lemme sing the one i picked an see what you think
she sings when theres a fire in your heart break the glass sound the alarm
he picks up one of the couch pillows and holds it over his ear
oh you prick
she pulls it from his hand
how bout if i just cut off your damn water
im too moved by your gentility to speak
she immediately softens and tries to become more refined
sugar you know how i feel about you dont you

bringing her face close to his you know there idn anything in the world i wouldnt do for you baby

he finishes the beer and holds the can out to her
grabbing it from him serveza yourself
she stands up no dammit i would easy
and as she turns and goes toward the kitchen but you heal fast
through the open door to the kitchen rayette can be seen opening the refrigerator
she takes out a can of beer and returns to bobby
over the above you can play the piano an your whole damn family can play on some type a musical instrument
an all im askin is for you to listen to my singing for one single little second
she hands him the can and sits back down on the couch

she sits down and begins removing the tag
i dont know ill holler up elton an stoney
she thinks about it then moves closer to him and begins unbuttoning his workshirt as ill go out with you or ill stay here and do anything youd like for
me to do
if youll just do one thing
if youll tell me that you love me
you can sing the song
annoyed you know what you are never satisfied
thats right hand
the response makes her deeply insecure and she immediately lays her body against his
oh now baby
and initiates another round of kissing
bobby lifts his ball from the return rack moves to the lane and bowls a perfect strike
making a self congratulatory gesture of triumph he turns back to elton seated at the scoring table
his wife stoney is seated beside rayette on the horseshoe banquette
as he addresses rayette we note that eltons two front teeth are missing
okie accent your ball ray
reluctant is this suppose to be fun
go on get up there
she rises and moves to the rack
and stay relaxed this time
picking up ball she moves to the head of the lane and slings it down the alley watching hopefully as
it rolls off to the right and takes only one pin
as she moves to her second ball
now dont loft it just release it like i told you
as she bowls the ball down the right hand rut and comes back to the banquette apologizing the balls too heavy for me honey
he looks past her to stoney about to bowl her ball
its not the damn ball
and as stoney bowls a strike rayette hugs his arm
im tryin baby so dont start gettin mad now

just spot and follow through
and as elton bowls a strike
he gets up and passes elton on his way to the rack

rayette to stoney as she watches bobby prepare to bowl idn he somethin to see
and as he makes another strike and returns to the banquette she gets up and throws her arms around him
he returns her embrace smiling over her shoulder at two heavily made up young women twinky and betty taking possession of the adjacent lane
note that betty is of diminutive proportions while twinky is amazonian
is it my turn again

he remains standing watching as she throws another gutter ball and then comes back toward him alibi ing i cant help it honey the ball just keeps goin cocky wobbly

she moves to the rack and concentrating hard advances down the lane and releases the ball
it rolls slowly down the center hits at precisely the right spot and clears the pins
atta boy ray
ecstatic she comes back to the banquette seating herself beside bobby and trying to solicit a response from him
that was damn good wadn it
i finally did it
begins removing his bowling shoes why dont you throw zs for frames and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game
turning to address the two young women over the back of the banquette
wasnt it ladies
pointing at herself are you talking to us
rayette pulls off her rental shoes and throws them to the floor
im gonna go wait in the car
he stretches his arms out on the back of the banquette as though he intends to reside there awhile
yeah why dont you do that
she grabs her sling back and her purse and as she gets up wait an ill i go with you honey
as she picks up her belongings and follows rayette changing his shoes we gotta get on home an relieve the sitter
whynt you an ray come on over
ill settle up for the beers
hands him the bowling shoes an walk rayette over with you will you
elton moves off and bobby now full of remorse slumps into a depressed reverie
beyond him betty and twinky can be seen engaged in some discussion concerning him
a waitress with a tray approaches and leans down to him
can i get you anything else
how much do i owe you
fivell do it
he takes some loose bills from his pocket and lays them on her tray
she thanks him and moves off
as he reaches down and pulls on one of his boots twinky approaches behind him and leans down over the back of the banquette
we been wantin to ask you something
are you the guy on yv

pointing lo betty she says youre the one that sells all the cars on tv

rayette sits sulking in bobbys car
he comes up to the passenger window and leans down to her

he casually slaps the outside of the door
see you later then
he walks off through the lot
staring out through the windshield
as he stops and comes back to the car
no one would want to hit on you you look too pathetic

he hesitates briefly then well now what do you think
though hardly an undying declaration its close enough to fill her with forgiveness
reaching over she pulls him into her arms
kaleidoscopic series of scenes showing elton and bobby working the rig as part of a four man team
the driller stands back giving them directives while the prestigious derrickman the star of the team lounges around in the b
though he has been working the fields for some months it is apparent that bobby is still somewhat of a novice in the operations of the rig
fade over above actions to an impromptu card game taking place on a lunch break
improvised bobby in a buoyant mood lays down a winning poker hand and rakes in a pile of bills and change lying on the table
the participants include elton and three other toolpushers
in the b
as the game continues other hands can be seen changing clothes
bobby sits morosely on the couch beside twinky
one of his arms is around her the other holds a can of beer
both he and twinky are looking at
elton who rides betty on his leg as both sing ride a cockhorse to banbury cross
she begins to laugh with the hysterical abandon of a child and elton nearly beside himself looks over to bobby
god idn she the cutest damn thing in your life
having been up all night drinking they move unsteadily toward a derrick and are intercepted by the driller as they climb the stairs to the rig floor
he informs them they are unfit to work and impolitely eighty sixes them for the day
bobbys car slows as it moves into a freeway jam
he gestures out at the traffic as elton strumming a ukelele concludes his song
can you believe this shit
he takes a drink from a half pint of bard liquor then angrily hits at the steering wheel
a few cars ahead a truck can be seen carrying several furniture pieces protected by padded covers
give em the horn bob
look at these assholes
what the hell are they doing
the assholes are going nowhere and other cars close up behind and to both sides of bobbys car
he suddenly throws the car into park
i cant take this shit anymore
opens the door and gets out
moving down the freeway away from his car
behind elton can be seen sliding over into the drivers seat
as bobby steps up onto the fender of a car looking for the cause of the jam
hey get off my car
where the hells he goin
bobby cuts in front of another car and climbs up into the rear of the truck
moving to the front of it he looks out over the cab
pov of the glut of cars in all four lanes
quit foolin around
on his way out of the truck bobby pauses to look beneath one of the padded protectors then pulls it off to reveal an upright piano
he leans down to the keyboard and plays a few notes
shit whats he doin
bobby has pulled the bench out from beneath the piano and sitting himself begins to play a chopin prelude
elton can be seen applauding him
playing as the traffic begins to move and the truck with it
again elton leans out the window yelling at him you better get your butt off there bob
come on now
the right turn indicator is flashing and the truck begins to work its way across the lanes
of bobby playing as the truck heads for an off ramp
honking the horn and flailing his arm out the window as he tries to cross lanes
the traffic closes on his right preventing him from following
hemmed into the left hand lanes and the truck with bobby still playing pulling away on the off ramp
the truck slows and comes to a stop at a signal
bobby jumps out and moves to the sidewalk
following with him as he wanders boozed and aimless along the dispirited cheap streets of the city
rayette clears some plates from an empty table and crossing the diner sees
as he takes a seat at the counter she goes about her tasks ignoring him
he watches her as she moves to the only other customer and totals his bill
another waitress appears with a coffee silex
she gestures it at bobby and he nods
as she pours him a cup rayette moves to the register deposits some bills then turns and exits to the kitchen
bobby leans against a pickup adjacent to rayettes car
she comes out of the rear door of the diner hesitates as she sees him then moves past him to her car
i was with elton last night ray
maintaining her attitude of suffered injustice she reaches to the car door and opens it
its the truth
he reaches behind her and pushes the door shut
then gently taking hold of her arm he turns her toward him bringing his face close to hers
and as she turns away be begins to kiss her neck
she lowers her gaze to the ground quietly uttering you son of a bitch
bobby elton and stoney are seated on the couch all looking toward the tv playing an old black and white
rayette is seated on an adjacent chair holding an infant in her lap cooing and fawning over it throughout the following
i swore to god id never hire on to this type a work again
christ i dont know how the hell i let you talk me into it
rayette reaches over to bobby
give me a swig hon
he hands her his beer and as she takes a sip and hands it back you didn know i was a derrickman once did you
bobby shakes his head

elton turns to him with a gap toothed smile you know you oughta get you one them things bob
as he stands up

stretching his arms an i oughta live in a trailer park with my front teeth poked out
seated on the rig floor opposite bobby who eats a sandwich as well what if she was bob
i cant see nothin so bad in it
bobby scowls hostilely at him
what if i was to let you in on the little fact that she is
he looks away from elton not wanting to hear
she told me

as he continues hell idn it just somethin to face up to
ill tell you somewhere along the line you even get to likin the whole idea
i recall when stoney first give me the news i could a shit
bobby throws his sandwich onto the rig floor near eltons leg
he looks down at a spatter of mayonnaise on his pants
well idn that nice
attacking the messenger its ridiculous
im sitting here listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine
he spills out the remainder of coffee from his cup and screws it onto the top of a thermos
just keep telling me about the good life elton if you want a see me puke my lunch
elton reaches down and wipes the mayonnaise off his pant leg
if youre sayin youre somethin bettern what i am thats one thing
but i cant say much a someone whod run off an leave a woman in a situation like this an feel easy about it
an thats all i gotta say
i hope thats all you gotta say el cause im about as tired of your mouth as i am workin this stinkin hole
he grabs his jacket and his lunch bucket jumps down off the rig and begins walking toward his car parked by the field office
in the b
elton gets up and hurls his hard hat toward bobby
as he approaches his car he looks toward the field office where
the driller is leaning down to a car with two men in it
calling over to him hey longcipher
the driller gestures a direction to the driver of the car and as it pulls off he moves toward the office longcipher
im talking to you
the driller opens the office door and looks back to bobby
did you hear me
i said im quitting
i dont give a shit what you do
you ben more trouble than youre worth an im damn glad to be rid of both a you assholes
he goes into the office and closes the door
throwing his jacket and his lunch bucket into his car
as he starts to get in his attention is drawn back to the rig
the car that held the two men is parked next to it and both men are on the rig platform moving toward elton
he backs away from them breaks toward the rig tour and starts to climb it
one of the men catches hold of his leg and yanks him back
elton pulls loose from him jumps to the ground and begins running with both men in pursuit
whats goin on
he starts sprinting back to the rig
the first man has a hold on elton and is struggling to subdue him
he is joined by the second man and as they force his arms behind his back and cuff his wrists
bobby moves into frame grabbing onto the first man and wrestling him away from elton
dont do that bob
its the law
bobby hurls the man onto the ground and turns around to go after the second man struggling with elton
its the law bob dont mix in
the second man pushes elton aside and as bobby throws a punch at him
look out behind
the other grabs him from behind holding him while the second man jams a fist into his stomach and as he doubles over follows with a violent chop to the
back of his neck
bobby slumps to the ground and as the first man puts a knee into his back and prepares to handcuff him hey dont do that
dont you think you could just leave him
the second man takes hold of elton and starts to move him off
sure as hell he wouldn a done that if hed known who you was
would you bob
bobby dazed raises his head from the dirt looking toward elton
christ almighty whats happening here
okay let him go
as he starts pushing a resistant elton toward the car bobby sits up
tell me what in the hells going on elton
i got accused a robbin a fillinstation down in the indian nation didn i tell you
i got wild an jumped my bail
he takes him roughly by the arm and moves off with the first man following
over his shoulder to bobby an here they come runnin after me a year later
aint that somethin
looking toward the two men forcing elton into the rear seat of the car as he calls back to bobby tell stoney for me will you
tell her to come get me
they close the door on him and get into the car
as it drives off
bobby sits watching until it disappears from sight then he sits back against a pump casing and drops his head onto his chest
she opens her mouth and rends the air with a keening wail
her face beads with moisture and journeys through expressions indistinguishable from grief and anguish
presently an ecstatic and very professional screech issues from her after which she reaches up and pulls bobby down onto her breathing into his ear
donnie oh donnie
bobby dressed in a suit and tie moves through a network of hallways checking the door numbers
he arrives at a door designated as studio a and after hesitating for a moment opens it and steps inside
two recording engineers glance at him without interest and return to their dials and needles
bobby looks from them through the glass partition to the recording studio in view beyond
elizabeth tita dupea is at the piano intensely into the bach
she wears a monastic looking dress her unruly hair is pinned back from her face and her glasses lie on the bench beside her
watching her with both affection and appreciation
she is sounding as she plays in tones out of key and discordant with the bach
there she goes again
bobby glances over at him then looks back to tita
she hunches over the keyboard and plays an arpeggio humming a long monochromatic note
my year old can carry a tune better than that
bobby is about to defend her when the engineer flips a toggle switch and addresses the mike feeding into the studio miss dupea
there is no response and she continues playing
more emphatic miss dupea
bobby can be seen in the b
having difficulty restraining his irritation under the following id like to remind you again this isnt an opera or a musical comedy
was i singing again
if you want to call it that
well you have to simply tell me thats all
thats exactly what i am doing again
do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first
this is tiring me
i have a suggestion
why dont we take a break
oh for pitys sake
she puts her elbows on top of the piano and drops her head into her bands
is she going to cry again
i dont want to take a break
what would you like in your coffee
she makes a mumbled response her head still in her bands tea
would you tell her bobbys here
to the mike miss dupea bobbys here
she raises her head squints toward the booth then grabs her glasses from the bench and puts them on
bobby enters the studio and comes toward her opening his arms
she rushes into his embrace burying her face in his shoulder
very emotional oh my goodness
she raises her head to look at him and verging on tears robert eroica
no im not
taking a deep breath then im not
tita sits on the piano bench crying and searching through her purse for a tissue
bobby hovers behind her gently patting her on the back and glancing with some embarrassment toward the recording booth
i just cant look at you
as she blows her nose into the tissue a young man comes into view hands bobby a paper cup and leaves
tita takes another tissue from her purse and dabs at her eyes
you always do this to me
well i dont mean to
setting the cup down on the piano heres your tea tita
then oh no dont put it on there
she quickly picks up the cup and places it on the floor
caressing the piano this is a very special very old cb
you know who it once belonged to
waldnit von schnechter
politely no kidding
he sits down on the bench beside her
it has absolutely no objectionable idiosyncrasies
and tests it out with a brief flourish on the keys
she watches him then robert
stops playing very nice
i have to talk seriously with you
everybody still up on the island
well herberts mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra so at the moment theres just daddy carl and myself
and van oost
whos van oost
not fond of the subject catherine shes a pianist
shes working with carl
carls a fiddler
whats he doing coaching piano
well months ago he was on his bicycle on his way to the post office in la roche
and he ran into a jeep and sprained his neck
sprained his neck
tita laughs then its not funny
he permanently sprained his neck and since then its been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin
crashes into a jeep and totals his neck
shaking his head thats carl
robert i have to tell you something
daddys very ill
oh well what whats he
hes had two strokes
he looks away from her not wanting to hear any more
they feel he
maybe he might not recover and that hell either
standing up dont tell me about this
he moves away from the piano and tita turns to look at him
but dont you think its right though that you should see him at least once
miked were ready miss dupea
to the booth just a minute please
to bobby robert dont you think its right that you should see him
he moves aimlessly about trying to subdue his anguish
i guess so
im going back up tonight
will you go with me
he glances at her catching her profound disappointment
id rather drive up myself and
maybe go into canada after
and i cant stay long tita probably a week at the most
he looks toward the booth
then to tita i better let you
she gets up from the bench and goes to him taking hold of his arm
ill walk out with you
as they move to the hall door she addresses the booth ill be back in two minutes
cut that in half will you
she smiles at bobby as they go out into hall
they hate me i feel
down the hallway
maybe you better stay then
no i need to talk to you about so many things
well ill be seeing you in a couple of days wont i
they stop at the stairway
oh god im so glad robert that youre coming
yeah me too
itll be so good for you and for daddy because you know youve never really
cutting her off tita ive got to go
he kisses her
feeling herself about to break down again she attempts a valiant smile and stands watching as
bobby turns and goes down the stairs
moving from his car up the walkway and entering rayettes house
playing the above song
a rumpled blanket on the couch to
a can of beer and a lighted cigarette burning in an ashtray on the coffee table
calling out hello
he crosses to a hall and moves down toward the bedroom
you have the day off
he steps into the doorway to see rayette lying in bed her back against the pillows staring at the wall
are you sick
you heard about elton i guess
she turns her gaze to the window
he looks at her briefly then okay i get your point
as he moves to the closet hope you didnt strain yourself getting in here and into your pose before i hit the door
he picks up a suitcase from the closet floor grabs some of his clothes from the rack and moving to a chair sets the suitcase on it and begins packing
i have to go home
my fathers sick
rayette turns on her side making a snorting sound of disbelief
yeah its very funny
he moves to a dresser extracts his underwear and returns to the suitcase
ill be gone two or three weeks
not looking at him youll be gone period
he closes the suitecase secures it
ill try and call you from up there
and picking it up moves around the bed toward the door
he stops setting the suitcase on the bed and looking down at her
she is still faced away from him her shoulders trembling as she weeps soundlessly
very emotional come on dipesto
i never told you it would work out to anything
did he looks away from her to the window
ill send you some money thats all i can do
returning his gaze to her and
ill call you like i said
he pauses then bye ray
an audible sob finally comes from her
bobby quickly picks up the suitcase and moves out of the bedroom and down the hall
as he moves into view
he throws the suitcase in through the rear window moves around to the drivers side and gets in
he starts the motor angrily throws it into gear and places his hands on the wheel
bobbys hand slashes at the arm of the record player pulling it across the grooves and stifling tammy wynette
do you want to go with me ray
his car moves north along the pacific coast highway
looking over at rayette and smiling
she returns his look with absolute devotion then reaches over and caresses the back of his neck
out past bobbys profile to a southern california pastoral landscape passing by
singing the above song
theres been hot spells an cold spells ever since we met ive seen your small fires your big fires but i wont give up yet oh someday youll yearn cause
your hearts gonna burn for that old familiar glow youll be burned
bobby laughs and she looks over at him
you like it
i love it
resumes singing youll be burned out or smoked out an come back to me i know
bobbys attention is taken by something on the road ahead
every trail that you blaze makes me
what the hell is that
of a car lying upside down on the left side of the highway
two figures are standing beside it engaged in a heated argument
is it an accident
bobby pulls off onto the right hand shoulder stops the car and gets out
he moves out to the center line looking across the road to a long haired young woman palm in levis and parka presently pushing her close cropped boyish looking friend
terry against the side of the car and making some indecipherable accusation
whats going on whats the trouble
the young woman turns and gives him the finger
sticking her head out the drivers window
whatd she say
gesturing angrily back at the wreck as she crosses toward bobby
look at my car
piece of shit
i just bought it brand new from a used car lot and the steering goes to the pot on me
youre lucky no one was hurt
seven hundred dollars down the toilet
id like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out
can you give us a lift
without waiting for a response she moves back to terry who is retrieving some of their belongings from the highway
come on terry we got a ride
jesus what a rude person
palm and terry still under the spell of their roadside tiff sit in sulky silence in the back seat
bobby glances at palm in the rear view
whats your name
rayette turns around and thinking terry is a boy asks rather flirtatiously an whats your name
shocked at the female voice coming from him she turns back around and pokes bobby on the leg
low tones ill tell you
spelling out l a t e r
how far are you going to
well get off in washington and hook another ride
where are you going
are you on vacation
sullenly she wants to live there because she thinks its cleaner
cleaner than what
to terry you dont have to tell everybody about it
pretty soon theyll all go there and it wont be so clean
how do you know its clean
i saw a picture of it
alaska is very clean
it appeared to look very white to me
dont you think
thats before the big thaw
she leans forward looking annoyed
before the what
moving through the redwood country above san francisco
bored as he drives
beside him rayette primps in the sunvisor mirror
terry lights a cigarette while palm staring morosely out the window goes into a soliloquy i had to leave this place
i got depressed seeing all the crap
and the thing is theyre making more crap you know
theyve got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap i cant believe it
people thats who
pretty soon there wont be room for anyone
theyre selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine
i believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it
rayette leans around to her
thered never be a hole big enough
now took at me for instance when i was just one person before bobby i had so much garbage collectin onto me every day i was thinkin about gettin a
a dispose all whats that but more crap
ive never seen such crap
oofh i dont know how people get up in the morning
mass production is what does it
what do you mean mass
i have to come out and tell you youre not that clean either
wait a minute
im not that neat maybe but i am clean
well youre not that bad but some people
i mean peoples homes just filth
ive been in peoples homes
in my personal observation i think that more people are neat than are clean
in my personal thing i dont see that
im seeing more filth
a lot of filth
what they need to do every day no once in a while is a cockroach thing where they spray the homes
can you imagine if their doors were painted a pretty color and they had a pot outside with
yeah it could be adorable
and they picked up
i mean it wouldnt be filthy with coke bottles and whiskey and those signs everywhere
she gestures angrily out the window at the roadside billboards
they oughta be erased
all those signs selling crap and more crap and i dont know its disgusting i dont even want to talk about it
bobby starts to say something well
its just filthy
people are dirty
i think thats the biggest thing thats wrong with people
i think they wouldnt be as violent if they were clean because then they wouldnt have anybody to pick on
see dirt isnt bad
filth is bad
thats what starts maggots and riots
she suddenly leans over to the front seat pointing to a semi ahead
hey follow that truck
they know the best places to stop
thats an old maids tale
truck drivers know the best eating places on the road
rayette turns around asserting salesmen and cops are the ones
if youd ever waitressed honey youd know
dont call me honey mack
dont call me mack honey
i wouldnt be a waitress
theyre nasty and full of crap
you better hold onto your tongue
giving her the finger hold onto this
just one minute you
dont you ever talk to me like that
all of you
all four are seated at a booth
the women have given their orders and a waitress stands above bobby waiting for his looking at his menu ill have an omelette no potatoes
give me tomatoes instead and wheat toast instead of rolls
the waitress indicates something on the menu with the butt of her pencil
what does that mean
you dont have any tomatoes
we have tomatoes
but i cant have any
is that what you mean
only whats on the menu
again indicating with her pencil a number two plain omelette
it comes with cottage fries and rolls
i know what it comes with but thats not what i want
ill come back when youve made up your mind
she starts to move away and bobby detains her
wait ive made up my mind
i want a plain omelette forget the tomatoes dont put potatoes on the plate and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee
im sorry we dont have side orders of toast
i can give you an english muffin or a coffee roll
what do you mean you dont have side orders of toast
you make sandwiches dont you
would you like to talk to the manager
to palm shut up
to the waitress you have bread dont you and a toaster of some kind
i dont make the rules
okay ill make it as easy for you as i can
give me an omelette plain and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast no butter no mayonnaise no lettuce and a cup of coffee
she begins writing down his order repeating it sarcastically one number two and a chicken sal san hold the butter the mayo the lettuce and a cup of coffee
now all you have to do is hold the chicken bring me the toast charge me for the sandwich and you havent broken any rules
challenging him you want me to hold the chicken
i want you to hold it between your knees
the other three laugh and the waitress points to a right to refuse sign above the counter
you see that sign sir
bobby glances over at it then back to her
youll all have to leave im not taking any more of your smartness and your sarcasm
he smiles politely at her then you see this sign
he reaches his arm out and clears the table for her
in the back seat
that you could figure all that out and lay that down on her to come up with a way you could get your toast
i didnt get it did i
no but it was very clever
i would of just punched her out
moving through the northwest coastal region
palm resumes her monologue people
shaking her head in utter disgust animals are not like that
theyre always cleaning themselves
did you ever see
what are they called
she looks over at terry slumped in her seat asleep
hes always picking on himself and his friends
theyre always picking bugs out of their hair
except monkeys do things out in the open that i dont go for
benumbed his eyes glazed over as he stares out through the windshield
i was in this place once this store with snakes monkeys everything you could imagine
i walked in i had to run out
they didnt even have an incense going
though no one listens she goes on working herself up and you know i read where they invented this car that runs on
that runs on
when you boil water
half dead steam
a car you could ride around in and not cause a stink
but do you know they will not even let us have it
can you believe it
he likes to create a stink
i wrote them a note once and told them to clean it
i mean dont you see that
its just filthy
i mean ive seen filth you wouldnt believe
oofh what a stink
i dont even want to talk about it
deposited at the side of the highway with their luggage duffle bags and television set lying on the road edge
terry lifts a bored hand to wave at
bobby behind the wheel
he waves back pulls out onto the highway and drives off
the car pulls into a motel parking slot and stops
bobby and rayette in bed
she lies on her side watching him watch tv
after a moment are you depressed about your daddy honey
i magine its me then idn it
is what you
youre depressed that i come along
who said i was depressed
well is that a happy face i see
cause if it was me i could just catch a greyhound back
oh youre not going to kill yourself this time
i wish id known
he turns off the light on the night stand and rolls onto his side faced away from her
they lie silently in the dark for a moment
then i dont know if im gonna be able to sleep or not
looking over at him hint hint
sighing then i guess ill just have to count the sheep
closing her eyes one two three four
she opens her eyes and looks over at him
caressing his shoulder look at this old cold shoulder what am i gonna do with it
he looks around at her and with gentle good humor if you just wouldnt open your mouth everything would be fine
she turns an imaginary key at her lips
tick a lock
he rolls over to face her and yielding to her request begins to make love to ber
rayette following after bobby
as he moves to his car he removes some cash from his wallet
why cant i go out to your folks house
give me one good reason
i have to see how things are first
my fathers sick you understand
they wouldnt be prepared for me bringing anyone
he holds out a roll of bills and as she takes them so how long am i supposed to sit an twiddle my thumbs in this place
if you cant do what i ask ray use that money to go back home then
bobby dont talk like that
she moves over to him and gives him a quick kiss
itll be all right ill get a hold a some magazines an things like that
an maybe find a beauty salon an get my hair fixed okay
getting into the car
or maybe sit out by the pool an get myself nice an tan for you
would you like that
starting the engine sure
it brings out my eyes
bye honey ill call you in a couple of days
she watches unhappily as he backs out of the slot and the car pulls away
bobby gets out of his car and wanders the deck of the ferry
he stops to look out over the sound to one of the islands off the washington coast then glances back to the mainland receding in the distance
bobby drives off the ferry onto the island
the car moves over a tree lined country lane and presently turns off onto a private road leading to a large victorian style house
it pulls to a stop behind two other cars
bobby gets out of the car and moves up the porch steps to the front door
closer on him as he hesitates listening briefly to the faint sound of two pianos coming from within
then he opens the door and goes inside
bobby tentatively wanders the first floor of the house taking in the ghosts of the past
in the living room he pauses at a table to look at several framed photographs
he picks up one of his mother and father looks closely at it then gently returns it to its place and resumes wandering
he stops at the music room and looks in through the half opened door on the far side of the room near windows which give view to a verdant exterior
are two concert grands
his brother carl is seated at one of the pianos and a young woman catherine van oost is seated at the other
looking from carl to catherine
he watches her briefly then steps out of the doorway
and moves down a hallway to a closed door
he reaches down and opens it looking inside to grooming the hair of an elderly man nicholas dupea seated in a wheelchair with his back to bobby
she looks up and seeing bobby smiles happily then reaches down and turns the wheelchair around
his eyes are half closed and are cast down to the floor
bobby moves over to him bending down and looking into his face
nicholas opens his eyes slightly and gazes through bobby into an absolute elsewhere
bobby raises his eyes to tita
he doesnt even know who the hell i am
nicholas dupea sits at the head of the table being fed his dinner by a male nurse spicer
bobby at the opposite end of the table is seated next to tita
unable to bear looking at his father he glances over at catherine seated next to carl on his right
she raises her eyes from her plate to ask him something just as tita is moved to reminisce remember bobby what mother used to say when
to bobby how long have you been
to tita oh excuse me
no its all right you go ahead
i was just going to ask robert how long hes been away from here
four or five years
no the last time was three years ago
oh no its been much more than that
away from the piano tita you have no sense of time at all
i dont think thats true
it is true
besides being very rude
what have you been doing since then
what have i been doing
different things different jobs here and there
nothing that interesting
and you no longer play at all
bobby starts to reply and is interrupted by you know just after i came back off tour with the betenthaller quartet dad myself and herbert had a summit conference about
oh my a summit conference
i wonder where i was polishing silver behind the coal bin
i dont know where you were penis envy
i hope i didnt hear that
at any rate dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out and i said what for
whatever the hell hes doing even if its a completely wasteful escapade its entirely his business
simple as that
well i really appreciate it carl
i dont think you should infer daddy was wrong in front of him
she looks at spicer pushing a spoon at nicholass closed mouth
dont force him like that spicer
spicer lays the spoon down and begins eating his own dinner
to catherine how long have you been staying here
a couple of months
he starts to ask another question and is again overridden by did you hear about my misfortune robert
its still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck
if i wanted to turn toward catherine for instance id first have to twist the whole base of my body around
demonstrating like this
tita gets up from the table and taking her plate exits to the kitchen
and as carl readjusts himself in his chair and takes a sip from his wine glass bobby looks at catherine to find her looking at him
she quickly alters her gaze to carl
i wouldnt mind doing a little work if youre finished and not too tired
no im finished
placing a hand on his stomach satiety is my father and mother
finding hes amused himself and nobody else he gets up and addresses bobby
shes tremendously gifted this girl
looking at her is she
catherine stands up and wanting to change the subject excuse me i dont want to hear this
she exits and carl on his way out pauses at bobbys chair
i hope you feel at home robert
patting him on the shoulder im really glad youre here
he looks down table to see spicer stacking his plate onto nicholass and his eyes follow him as he too moves out of the dining room to the kitchen
in extreme discomfort at being left alone with his father
he looks down at his plate poking at the remainder of his dinner then braves a look down the table
looking back at him his eyes devoid of interest or cognition
bobby and tita walk away from the house down toward the ocean
accompanying them is a borzoi hound belonging to her
he has ways of communicating robert
i can tell when hes expressing approval or disapproval just from his eyes
its not that bad
yes it is
i cant take seeing him sitting there like a stone
a week or two isnt going to ruin your life for godsakes
he doesnt respond
i mean you think im that happy
no i dont
a pause then you shouldve left a long time ago
we cant all get up and leave can we
i mean there are certain needs you have to respond to
she stops walking and moves to one of the garden chairs facing out toward the bay
and anyway i want you to stay so i can spend some time with you and ask you some questions
he leans his back against a tree
well do you i mean have you enjoyed all these
strange things youve been doing
she stares at him for a moment and taking note of it why
am i some kind of freak to you or something
no no i dont think that im just curious about it
a pause do you think im a freak
what is it
the way i look
no i dont really think youre a freak
i probably am but i dont care
i mean i wasnt that blessed to begin with and when would i have had time to make any improvements
what about carl and catherine
is he just coaching her or what
night and day
and unless i get up before the birds i cant get in any practice time for myself
actually its very admirable the way she works
shell probably be enormously successful because shes attractive as well not that thats so important in music but
youre attractive tita
if you just did a little more with yourself
well if you just maybe did something with your hair or
oh lets not talk about my hair it does what it wants to and anyway who cares i want to talk about you
theres nothing to say tita
he offers nothing further and looks out over the bay
then after a brief silence well youre not going to run out on me right away are you
i dont know
bobby strolls casually about the house in truth looking for an opportunity to run into catherine
he moves to the music room and looks inside
catherine can be seen seated at the piano
carl stands above her and they engage in some exchange about the score resting on the pianos music stand
as he moves down the hallway and sees spicer descending the staircase with the brittle nicholas in his arms
he ducks into the nearest room to avoid them
tita startled in the act of appraising herself in a mirror above the fireplace turns around to bobby oh god dont sneak up on me like that
we see she wears a little make up and has done something different with her hair
he turns and exits the den
bobby stands on the front porch looking toward
catherine coming up from the ocean
she wears a bathrobe over a wet bathing suit and carries a towel and as she approaches hello
i guess you fell in the water
amused yes intentionally
thats dangerous you know
playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water
you could get a cramp
she laughs and begins drying her hair with a corner of the towel
i love to swim and i dont mind the cold at all
well i wouldnt want to get too invigorated myself
what would i do with it
she comes up the stairs
besides piano and swimming what else do you do
well theres fishing and boating
theres concerts on the mainland and
but i feel silly telling you
this is really your home
you probably know better than i what there is to do
then it must be very boring for you here
have you anything to suggest
i dont know
let me give it some thought
she moves toward the front door with bobby following
whatre you doing right now
catherine comes inside and moves toward the stairway with bobby behind
right now im going to run a hot tub and soak myself
then after that
she goes up a few steps and turns back to him
after that i plan to read some music and rest for awhile
tomorrows a full practice day
continues up the stairs but the day after is kind of open
at the top of the stairs she stops and looks down at him
carl has hydrotherapy on tuesdays
as if it were a year the day after tomorrow
if youre free
yeah ill probably be free
she turns and disappears into the second floor hallway
dinner has concluded and tita moves around the table distributing cups and saucers
carl is remote and off his feed
spicer attends nicholas and catherine looks across the table to bobby as he drinks from a bottle of beer
after a moment a loud belch comes from nicholas and tita quickly requests dont laugh
she attempts to stifle her own amusement as do bobby and catherine then changes the subject whats wrong carl you hardly ate anything
i took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach
catherine begins pouring the coffee
one thing thats hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music and then just walk away from it without a second thought
i gave it a second thought
tita seats herself at the table addressing spicer he looks tired to me spicer
i think you should put him to bed
he nods and as he gets up and wheels nicholas from the room i mean how could you not play anymore
thats so strange to me
i have played a few times
here and there
as a matter of fact i was once a rehearsal pianist for a las vegas musical revue
you dont call that music though
of course i do
he places his hands on the table and simulates the playing of a rousing production type show stopper simultaneously vocalizing as he does
though tita and catherine are amused carl winces disapprovingly and breaks into bobbys act robert do you mind
will you excuse us for a while
he takes hold of catherines hand and stands up
we really dont have to carl if youre not feeling good
a bit martyred well maybe if we put the thermaphore on me for a while first
oh all right
and as they move to the door she glances apologetically back at bobby
deflated and embarrassed he looks away from titas sympathetic gaze
after a brief silence she reaches to a platter on the table
do you want some gingerbread
bobby stands in the living room
it is dark and the only light comes from some burning logs in the fireplace
he listens briefly to the sounds of a beethoven sonata coming from the music room
then moves to a chaise near the fireplace and lies down staring absently into the flames
after a moment he closes his eyes
on his sleeping face as the sonata begins to fade
still asleep in the chaise
he is suddenly jolted awake by a loud thud and sits up looking out the window to lifting a barbell with heavy weights attached to it
he does a series of vigorous presses with it before he again lets the bar drop heavily onto the porch
bobby stands in the hallway a phone to his ear listening to rayette and looking down the hall toward the open door to catherines room
yeah well fine you know what i suggest ray
listening because i dont know how long
things are not going that well here
he listens again his eyes on catberine moving around in her room
yeah well im not having any fun either so why dont you
pause no you cant its just not convenient and i have to get off
listening impatiently ray i really have to go i have to get off now
longer pause another couple of days maybe
ill call you and let you pause all right if youre gone youre gone
now i have to get off okay
pause bye ray
he hangs up and as he starts down the hall to catherines room the violin stops and carl steps out into the hall ahead of him
he carries his fiddle and detains bobby with only minutes of playing and its already killing my neck
bobby looks past him to catherine as she glances out at them and then closes the door to her room
bobby and carl playing a game of table tennis
tita stands leaning against a tree watching them
in the b
spicer can be seen meticulously oiling and cleaning the wheelchair
as they volley the ball back and forth you sure you should be playing carl
what do you mean
aside from my neck im in superb shape
carl hits into the net and as the ball rebounds to him he tosses it to bobby
serving i dont know theres something wrong with the way you move
carl hits the net again
im not aware of it
carl serves and as they volley id hate to see you walk across a concert stage like that
carl tries a smash and mis hits the ball
and as he retrieves it irritated with bobby ive walked across a stage a number of times without exciting any particular response
thats what i mean
carl comes back to the table
any particular humor i meant
he angrily serves the ball
returning i think you should get someone to coach you how to walk
i think its a substantial problem
he hits a smash and it sails past carl into some shrubbery several yards away
as he moves after the ball bobby gestures at him
look at that
why are you being so mean
he does walk funny
dont you see that
she looks at carl bent over and searching through the shrubs
i dont think id notice
im so used to carl
wanting to go on about it yeah well hes
she interrupts him looking toward spicer
do you think spicer is attractive
he looks over at spicer polishing the frame of the wheelchair
i think hes got a terrific personality
you know he was formerly a sailor
bobby gestures his paddle at carl on his way back with the ball
look cant you see that what im talking about
sailors are sadistic i feel
carl comes up to the table asserting see
theres nothing wrong with the way i walk
now where are we
at game carl
carl serves and they volley briefly
then bobby angles the ball sharply and puts it away
thats three games to none carl
all right lets have a rematch
i thought you had to go to the mainland today
arent you going to miss the ferry
carl takes a quick glance at his watch then drops his paddle onto the table
just when i was hitting my stride
he starts away then turns back
say goodbye to catherine for me will you
as he moves off in the direction of the cars tita comes up beside bobby
can i play now
carl calls over to them from his car tell her ill be back sometime tomorrow
bobby turns to tita
where is she anyway
ignoring the question my turn
he hands her the paddle
why dont you and spicer play
and moves off toward the house
bobby knocks on catherines door and hearing no response opens it and steps inside
he wanders about discreetly touching nothing but taking in some essence of catherine from her belongings and from the scent of her that lingers in the room
his journey brings him into proximity with the windows and he pauses to look out at playing table tennis
he starts to move from the windows when he sees pulling into view and parking near the garage
she gets out and carrying a shopping bag and a wrapped bouquet of flowers pauses on her way to the house to have some exchange with tita
quickly descending the staircase and following with him as he moves to the music room and goes inside leaving the door open
he crosses to one of the grands seats himself and rubs his hands together to warm them
then scanning his mental repertoire he places his hands on the keyboard and begins to play a chopin etude
presently catherine appears in the doorway
she stands listening for a moment then places the shopping bag and flowers on a settee near the doorway and crosses to a chair near the pianos and sits down
bobby glances at her then returns his eyes to the keyboard
her features intensely concentrated as she listens to his playing
apparently deep into the music
on the wall behind him are the series of photographs seen in the opening and the present angle favors an year old bobby in his dress suit playing a recital
the camera moves down to his hands
then to catherine profoundly moved
as bobby plays the concluding chords of the etude
he lets his hands linger on the keys until the last overtones fade then he removes them to his lap
after a brief silence that was beautiful robert
i was really very moved by the way you
unable to keep up the serious musician pose a brief derisive laugh issues from him
is that funny
it wasnt supposed to be it just struck me that way
its just that
i picked the easiest piece i could remember
i think i first played it when i was years old and i played it better then
it doesnt matter
it was the feeling i was affected by
i didnt have any
you had no inner feeling
then i must have been supplying it
she gets up and crosses toward the settee
well at least youre accomplished at something
at being a fake
and as she picks up the flowers and the shopping bag catherine
no youre very good at it
im really impressed
she goes out the door
bobby looks down at the keyboard
he closes the cover and softly utters shit
she stands in front of a dresser mirror pinning up her hair preparatory to taking a bath
her attention is drawn to
bobby entering and as he crosses to her she quickly turns back to the mirror
you think im a fake
i think its what you think
no it isnt what i think
you made a very calculated move and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you
that wasnt necessary
she moves away from him and he follows her
yes it was
youve made it clear that if i can cut a little piano i might get a little response
stops and turns to him i dont think thats accurate
up to now what ive been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow
im not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks
and as for the day after tomorrow this is the day after tomorrow and i am unfortunately seeing you
now if youll excuse me id like to take a bath
she moves back to the dresser and as she begins searching through an array of bath oils on top of it bobby steps in beside her
its convenient to fake looking for something right now isnt it
im not faking anything
im looking for some bath oil
some bath oil
he lifts up one of the bottles
what about this one
picking up another or this one
and another how about some jasmine
and another what about some musk
what are you doing
knocking the bottles over what are you doing screwing around with this crap
a little intimidated by his aggressivity i dont find your language that charming
its direct anyway which seems to be difficult for you
id like you to leave now
is that direct enough
he makes no move to go
youre not a serious person by your own admission
and that may be interesting but it doesnt interest me
needing the safety of distance she moves over to the windows next to the bed
again he follows after her
serious thats whats important to you
yes thats whats important to me
he takes her by the shoulders
okay lets be serious
and forces her onto the bed
no dont do that
he hesitates for a moment full of things he wants to say and cannot
catherine looks up at him uttering a quiet challenge no inner feeling
i dont believe vou
he leans down to her begins kissing her
her arms encircle him and laying back on the bed she pulls his body onto hers fervently returning his kisses
and as he responds with an ardor absent of fakery and full of a lifetime of derelict feelings a fade over begins to catherine and bobby lie side by side
he watches her as she addresses the ceiling i married him when i was
he was a cellist and i thought he was the most brilliant man id ever met
and im sure he was because at that age i hadnt met that many
but he was insidious you know
he had me convinced that i was a mediocrity musically as a woman as an intellect
but in this completely imperceptible pleasant way so that you werent even sure he was doing it
anyway i just woke up one morning and i said you know something joseph youre full of beans and i left him
thats what you said
something witty and devastating like that
she moves onto her side looking over at him
as a matter of fact hes the one who introduced me to carl
a pause then how are you
carl restored my confidence
he really did
hes much more substantial than you give him credit for
she reaches over tentatively caressing his face then do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now
yeah i think i could
he kisses her gets up and crosses to the door and as he opens it robert
i could spend some time with you tomorrow morning before carl comes back i mean if youd like to
of course id like to
bobby and catherine walk over a path through a thickly wooded area that presently brings them in sight of the dupea house
he stops and taking hold of her leans back against a tree kissing her
when they break off and resume walking she takes one of his hands in both of hers and after looking at the scars and callouses accumulated by his years of
manual labor she lays the hand against her cheek
the angle alters from them to a taxicab pulls up in front of the house
rayette gets out with her suitcase and after paying the driver moves up the steps to the front door and reaches out to ring the bell
looking down the table to nicholas
you certainly do have a beautiful piece a real estate out here mr
the former with his chin resting on his chest
turning to bobby can he hear me
bobby doesnt respond
politely hes not hard of hearing
well thats a blessing at least
she takes a bite of food and as she chews this certainly is an improvement on the motel an the coffee shop
to bobby how could you have left such a beautiful place bobby
i dont know
fascinated with rayette while beside him catherine keeps her eyes on her plate as she eats
youve been staying in a motel all this time
for two whole weeks an there wasnt hardly nobody there to talk to but me
the manager of the place told me it was the off season an it must a ben because othern me there was just this year old kid delyon that didnt
appear to be all there an this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin for quiet
can you imagine
all you could a heard there was a pin an them hollerin away
i dont understand why you had to stay in a motel
theres more than enough room here
well i was goin to but bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first which i can understand but then it went an took so long i
ran flat outa money
to bobby i didnt have no number to call you know
to carl so i hadda clear outa there an come on up here in the hopes that i wouldnt be intrudin myself
youre more than welcome
well thank you thats a very nice thing for you to say
not at all
she goes on eating and there is a brief silence before she resumes looking over at catherine that certainly is a beautiful head a hair you have
is it natural
just finish eating
oh am i holdin up dessert
no youre not
go ahead and take your time
i do eat slow as a bird whereas bobby can put it away like a speed swing
to tita is there any ketchup around
oh for chrissakes
robert lets not be rude okay
its all right
he dont mean anything by that
i dont huh
he throws his napkin on the table gets up and leaves the room
there is an awkward silence followed by rayette valiantly covering her own feelings i guess bobbys just about the moodiest man i ever ben with
bobby finishes the last of several drinks
he ships a half pint into his jacket pocket lays some bills on the bar and moves toward the door
thoroughly anesthetized he wanders aimlessly through the harbor front streets
as he disappears into the dark the music fades
lying huddled on the boardwalk next to the boat slips
the crying of the gulls and the sound of outgoing fishing launches awaken him
disoriented he gets to his feet and hugging himself against the cold moves unsteadily down the dock
bobbys car pulls off the ferry and approaches a line of cars waiting to board
he sees catherine at the wheel of the first car and pulling abreast of her stops and rolls down his window
where are you going
im going to pick up some friends of carls
are you all right
i have to talk to you
ill be back later
the blocked cars behind each of them begin honking impatiently and continue to under the following no i want to talk to you now
i have to explain something about
no you dont have to it isnt necessary
overlapping her yes it is
a driver behind bobby sticks his bead out the window yelling furiously at him come on get moving dammit
turning around to him will you shut up for a minute
to catherine pull your car out of line
no i cant
will you let me talk to you please
i cant do that
i havent been being fair to carl
i have to tell you that
barely audible oh
you have to tell me that
i cant hear you
he looks back at her not responding
im sorry everythings been so confusing but i have to go robert
please ill see you later this evening
she pulls ahead and moves onto the ferry
a friend of carls
somewhere under the following the angle alters to include two other friends as well as carl catherine bobby and rayette seated around the living room variously captive to her monologue
but the point is man is born into the world with a pre existent adversary both real and imaginary so youd have to say that aggression was one of his
primary psychic inheritances which
john fincher a professorial type attempts to interject if i may beg to differ
beg all you like john but the fact remains that man takes enormous delight in aggressive acts as well as the portrayal of aggressive acts and to be triumphant over
another no matter how seems fundamental to his having a sense of well being as well as
no i dont quarrel with your inference but you draw too long a bow in your conclusions which seem unnecessarily harsh and
well i dont make poetry
as an analyst i
rayette interrupts calling across the room to carl is there a tv in the house
carl starts to answer and is pre empted by samia john believes in the basic goodness of man and thats fine but gaze into the pit like i have and
that view seems a little soporific
and not unlike television it hardly represents the real world
theres some good things on it though
theres some good things on it sometimes
i strongly doubt it but i wasnt really discussing media
if you really hold such bleak views how can you in good conscience carry on a practice
oh theres always hope i think for a few individuals if theyre courageous enough to shed their illusions and their
cutting her off and what about love
what about it
wouldnt you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love
no i wouldnt
well youre a romantic catherine as are most musicians and whats more about to be married
and his reaction as samia goes on which should exclude you from any objective discussion
but keep in mind even the arts arent free of aggressive content nor the institution of marriage
i think these cold objective discussions are aggressive samia
she gets up and starts to move away
but id like to say so that i dont dampen the spirit of your adventure
cutting her off you havent dampened my spirit samia
well i should hope not
she leaves the room with bobbys eyes following her and as carl moves over to sit beside rayette samia resumes to fincher while the other friend moves in beside bobby
and tries to engage him in conversation
because obviously there are loftier classes of people that do establish a kind of relating thats relatively free of
as she indicates titas dog lying near the fireplace
what kind of doggy is that
its a borzoi
oh uh huh
i had a little kittycat once that bobby give me
she calls across to bobby interrupting samia
the little pussycat you gave me
bobby now feeling trapped by the other friend looks across to her ass she returns her attention to carl
she had four little white paws an oh was i crazy over her
we hadda go an leave her one time at some friends an she went out an got smashed flattern a tortilla right outside their mobile home
samia gestures toward rayette as if she were an example to prove her point
you see what i mean
bobby looks over at samia
the choice of words squashed flat juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten
well she was
she addresses fincher gesturing toward rayette again
but you see how close that is to what im trying to
bobby stands up cutting her off dont sit there pointing at her
i beg your pardon
advancing on her i said dont point at her like that
what gives you the right to sit there and tell anybody about class and who the hells got it and what she typifies
you shouldnt even be in the same room with her you creep
carl this is really too much
to samia youre totally full of shit
robert i think you better just
cutting him off youre all full of shit
he turns away and exits the room
running up the stairs and down the hall to catherines room
he goes inside and not finding her comes quickly back into the hall
as he moves down it opening other doors he begins calling her name
he comes back down the stairs and runs into rayette at the bottom landing
moving past her i cant talk to you right now leave me alone
he moves to the music room to the den then down the main hall to the kitchen which gives off to two other doors
he opens one of them to see tita and spicer
though both are clothed they are caught in some stage of intimacy on top of spicers bed
tita sits up immediately mortally embarrassed as bobby steps into the room
tita what the hell are you doing
spicer stands up
hey this is my room
moving over to the bed whats going on here
its none of your business
i dont know where she is
spicer moves to bobby taking hold of his arm
dont you believe in knocking pal
bobby roughly pushes him away and advances on tita
im talking to you tita
close to tears cant i have anything to myself dammit
grabbing hold of him again come on now out
struggling with him keep your fucking hands off my sister nurse
spicer goes into sudden rage pushing bobby violently toward the door and yelling did you hear me
bobby leaps at him and as their struggle carries them into the kitchen tita begins yelling stop it
bobby will just you stop
i mean it
spicer gets bobby into a painful headlock and is being bulled around the kitchen by him
hold it just hold it
they crash into the kitchen table knocking chairs over
somebody get carl
bobby rams spicer into the refrigerator
take it easy dammit
he hurls him against the kitchen wall still holding him in a headlock as tita enters the kitchen
just stop it
and as she runs from the room spicer begins violently jerking his forearm up against bobbys trachea punctuating each jerk with the repeated command give up
he feels bobbys body slacken
he releases him and bobby drops to the floor as
carl catherine and tita run into the kitchen looking to bobby gasping for air tries to get up from the floor and unable to slumps back against the kitchen wall
oh god bobby look what youve done
he looks past her to catherine
i just wanted to talk to you for a minute
catherine and bobby sit on a low stone wall bordering the dupea property
each is staring out at the ocean and after a moment no
its useless robert
it wouldnt work not ever
just give me a chance will you
im trying to be delicate with you but youre not understanding me
its not just because of carl or my music but because of you
she looks at him i mean what would it come to
if a person has no love for himself no respect no love for his work his family his friends something
how can he ask for love in return
i mean why should he ask for it
profoundly wounded he looks away from her
and living out here in this rest home asylum thats what you want
looking back to her thatll make you happy
i hope it will yes
she pauses then im sorry
needing to distance herself from witnessing his pain she gets up and moves out of frame
his eyes move from her to look out over the bay and after a brief silence he softly utters okay
bobby pushes nicholass wheelchair along a path between fields of tall grasses and wildflowers
he stops and moves around to the front of the chair
are you cold
he leans over to adjust the blanket covering nicholass legs and hunkering down in front of him glances around at the fields searching for articulation i dont know if youd
be particularly interested in hearing anything about me
my life i mean
most of it doesnt add up to much
that i could relate as a way of life that youd approve of
he pauses briefly then id like to be able to tell you why but i dont really
i mean i move around a lot because things tend to get bad when i stay
and im looking
for auspicious beginnings i guess
he breaks off again resuming with evident difficulty
im trying to you know imagine your half of this conversation
my feeling is that if you could talk we probably wouldnt be talking
thats pretty much how it got to be before
another pause are you all right
he searches his fathers face entreating him for some kind of answer some sign of response and seeing none
i dont know what to say
he breaks down barely able to utter the following tita suggested that we try to
i dont know
i think that she
seems to feel weve got
some understanding to reach
she totally denies the fact that we were never that comfortable with each other to begin with
pauses trying to gain control the best i can do is apologize
he looks silently at his father for a moment
we both know i was never really that good at it anyway
then bowing bis head im sorry it didnt work out
bobby comes out the front door
he carries his suitcase and as he descends the steps and moves across the drive
tita wearing gloves and holding a pair of gardening clippers comes around the side of the house and calls out to him bobby
he sets the suitcase down as she comes toward him
i said a week and ive overstayed myself
you were going without saying goodbye
i didnt want to say goodbye to anyone
but what about me
smiling at her ill say goodbye to you tita
she puts her arms around him and as she embraces him just once in a while call and tell me where you are please
watch the birdie
they turn to see rayette standing near the open trunk of bobbys car taking a polaroid shot of them
bobby returns his attention to tita kissing her
tearing up bye robert
he picks up his suitcase and moves to the trunk where rayette is fussing with her camera
he puts the suitcase inside closes the trunk and takes hold of her arm
resisting him wait a sec
i want tita to take a picture of you an me in front of the place
no lets go
she pulls free of him and as she moves back toward tita bobby can be seen getting into the drivers seat
i never got the chance to thank you all for your hospitality
you tell carl for me if any of you folks wanta come on down to our place anytime youd be moren welcome
thank you thats very nice
bye bye now
she moves back to the car and gets in
watching as bobbys car pulls out of the drive and disappears onto the private road
as bobbys car moves over a highway through the northern forests rayettes voice is heard singing your kiss is like a drink when im thirsty an im thirsty for you
with all my heart
rayette is seated close to bobby looking at him as she sings
but dont love me then act as though weve never kissed oh dont touch me
she leans closer and kisses him then bringing her lips close to his ear dont touch me
she kisses him again
dont touch me
dont touch me
her kisses become more fervent and insistent
oh dont touch
he suddenly pushes her away
cut it out
grievously hurt by his gesture and expressive of an anger shes heretofore been afraid to reveal son of a bitch bobby
you quit pushin me away like that
ive had enough a that to last me a lifetime
she makes a fist of her hand as though she were about to hit him then changes her mind
whynt you just try an be good to me for a change
there is no response
she turns away from him looking out through the windshield for a moment then there idn anyone gonna look after you an love you bettern i do you know that
she looks over at him
did you hear me
there is no response
as it turns off the highway and pulls up into a gas station next to roadside cafe
searching through her purse
im gonna go in that cafe an get some coffee
you want anything
you got any change
he searches into his jacket takes out his wallet and hands it to her
dont you just have cents or somethin
he shakes his head
okay be right back
she reaches to the door and opens it
bobby gets out of the car as the station attendant approaches
rayette turns back to him as she nears the front of the cafe
sure you dont want anything
to attendant fill it up
the attendant moves to the pumps and as bobby crosses toward the mens room and disappears inside a peterbilt semi can be seen pulling into the station
bobby removes his jacket and lays it on top of the waste container
he moves to the wash basin and stands a moment gazing absently down at it his mind searching for that inward oblivion in which nothing much is demanded nothing much
then leaning over and placing his hands on the rim of the basin
he lifts his gaze to the mirror and after minutely perusing the features of his face looks into his own eyes as he had into his fathers silently beseeching them
remote angle as bobby comes out of the mens room
he has left his jacket inside and stands for a moment looking at the
driver bending down to check the undercarriage of the semi
as he stands up and circuits the front of the truck heading for the cab faintly audible hey wait a minute
he moves over to him and after a brief exchange the driver nods his bead and continues on to the cab bobby moves to the passenger door and climbs up
into the pass seat
the driver glances over at bobby havent you got a jacket or anything with you
no i dont i uh
it got burned up
everything in the car got the shit burned out of it
all i got left is what i have on
ive got an extra jacket behind the seat if you want to put it on
no its okay
but ill tell you where were headed is gonna get coldern hell
its all right
the driver puts the truck into gear and releases the brake
im all right
and as the truck begins to move forward im fine
the semi pulls out of the station onto the highway giving view to bobbys car
the attendant is cleaning the windshield and rayette can be seen opening the passenger door
as she gets out and surveys the area for some sign of bobby the semi moves into view going north on the highway
rayette looks over the hood of the car addressing the attendant
he gestures toward the mens room and as she moves across the station and disappears the semi recedes in the distance leaving a black trail of smoke from its exhaust
stack dissipating in the air
