and as he stared at the sky and listened to a cow mooing almost dreamily in a distant village he tried to understand what it all meant the sky and
the fields and the humming telegraph pole he felt that he was just at the point of understanding it when his head started to spin and the lucid languor of the moment became intolerable
vladimir nabokov in this script there are six main characters who inhabit different periods of time from pre history to the present day
but there is just one story
because we blend into one developing narrative the lives that we show
there is no suggestion of time travel or re incarnation or any other tricksy or mystic device
we can do in real time and with real characters what other movies strive to do with immortal time travellers and ghosts
our story is thoroughly based in reality and the magic we are dealing with is real human magic
in moving from one character to the next everything will change supporting characters setting period
but the essential situation of our hero of the moment will relate to the one before and the one following
the magic will be in the transitions in leaving one character and advancing the film through hundreds or thousands of years to find our next hero in tantalizingly similar human
the effect of these transi tions across space and time will let the audience grasp the simple truth behind our story that we are all in it together
the key to allowing the audience to enjoy this human connection at the heart of the film is that one actor will play the six individuals
the feeling will be of the endless glorious playing and replaying of the simple drama of being alive
we end the film with a present day hero but by that time we will be seeing this modern man in an entirely fresh light feeling his kinship with the
caveman and the slave and the others who have gone before
the resolution of his contemporary story is theirs also
by then perhaps we will be able to see ourselves in this novel perspec tive too
and the structure of the film itself has the thrill of novelty
it has never before been used in cinema
our six characters and their stories connect in many different ways some obvious others vague tanta lizing threads
even global connections are made as the planet itself and all its people come and go in the story
for the audience the game of making the connec tions feeling the bonds even inventing or discovering associations of their own will be endless in this big gest of stories
smallest of stories
it is truly a new cinematic experience
hector is a family man
he and his woman and two children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a hillside a shallow cave given protection at its entrance by a covering of
branches and brush
just inside a small fire smoulders permanently a few times a day encouraged into life for cooking or warmth
if it ever went out it would be a catastrophe so it remains a smouldering com fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family
hector doesnt know that his name is hector
it is simply a convenience to help us tell his story
the idea of individual names is an imaginative leap that has not yet been made by mankind when we first meet him
hector is living out his life years before the birth of christ in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet
in his entire life hector will traverse no more than ten square miles of it
is the reflection of hectors face in a rock pool
the image suddenly fragments
hector is enjoying himself deflecting his stream of pee now and then so that his image reforms itself and then is disrupted again
when he is finished a trace of vanity makes him bend down closer to his reflection
he strokes his long hair and fingers a blemish on his cheek
then he is aware of another presence
he sharply turns
some way off a solitary figure stands on the rise of some rocks not afraid to show itself
hector calls out
go back home
leave me alone
we see that the figure is a young boy hectors son
the boy thinks about it for a moment before turning and disappearing behind the rocks
the small fire that never goes out has been enlarged to cook the days meal
beyond the fire on a rock shelf hector plays with his children a girl of six and boy of eight
it is the usual rough romp that fathers indulge in but in bc possibly rougher than normal
hector is acting the part of some trapped wild animal lashing out at the hunters surrounding him
but in his act of wild rage he gets carried away
he picks up his son and throws him hard much too hard on his back
the boy tumbles down from the shelf to the cave floor at his mother deirdres feet howling in pain
deidre scowls at hector
if the gesture had been invented he would probably shrug his shoulders
the boy howls on
hector kneels beside his daughter absorbed in her antics as she sleeps
she is a vivid dreamer
her whole little form wriggles and contorts in response to the fantasy unspooling in her head
she emits unearthly nighttime noises squeals and giggles and moans
hector is fasci nated
where has his daughter gone
who is this strange wild creature that has taken her form lying beside him
hectors daughter delights him
and while hector watches his daughter deirdre from their bed watches hector
it is almost dawn the cave is quiet and the fire has diminished
by its light we see deirdre and hector making love on their bed of dried grass and skins
its diffi cult to say what their lovemaking might look like
what has years done to that art
we will think about it
on the far side of the cave we see the sleeping children
as we move closer we see that they are far from sleep
two sets of bright eyes peek out from under their cover
we cut between them the loving parents and the watching learning children
hector is arguing with his son just outside their cave
the boy wants to go foraging with him again
hector takes a few steps
the boy follows
hector walks on again taking big angry father strides
the boy stubbornly tags along at a safe distance
hector walks on for some time before turning on him
leave me alone
there is real anger in his voice
the boy wisely retreats to the cave
as hector turns to continue his walk alone he see deirdre looking at him accusingly from the entrance
she holds out her arms ready to comfort the boy rejected by his father
hector is in the classic timeless no win situation and he knows it
with a sigh of frustration he heads for the beach
hector is foraging on the shoreline gathering cockles seaweeds mussels crabs anything edible
he splashes in the shallows hoarding the food in a roughly woven bag
every now and then he will suck a cockle from its shell or crunch on a particularly tasty piece of seaweed
hector looks about years old
this is advanced middle age for his times and it shows
he has a heavy cold and an irritating hack in his throat
in a similar condition a modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly drugged days in bed perhaps attempting a little light paperwork propped up on some pillows
the sun is warming the day
hector sits on a rock sur veying his world
he seems very much a part of it
he watches some wading seabirds nearby
like him they are nosing around the margins of low tide for food
in another season they or their eggs will pro vide a meal or two
there is a strange atmosphere of appropriateness in the scene hector seems such an inte gral part of it
the easy fit of the man in his land scape strikes us
hector belongs to it in ways that a present day hunter or holiday maker or even naturalist never could
also there is an odd sense of the world being rather empty
whether the larger world is round or flat spinning or orbiting hector neither knows nor cares
he knows simple things
cold and hunger
he knows warmth rough comfort and companionship
his family and the safety of their cave
further along the shore hector drops his bag and straigh tens himself easing the ache in his back
then some thing disturbs him
from behind a distant headland a smudge of smoke trails into the sky
hector picks up his bag and runs
he knows where he is going
he reaches a vantage point on some rocks
he steadies himself and gazes hard out to sea
we can feel the strain in his eyes as he tries to detect any hint of threat in the glinting water
then his jaw drops in fear
around the edge of the headland two dark shapes proceed in regular motion
their steady progress is full of menace
oar driven boats slowly insistently making their way into hectors bay
he jumps from the rocks and runs up the beach toward the cave
one thing else that hector knows is fear blind gut turning fear
hector is a small figure in the landscape now racing up the steep slope in the direction of his home
he stops for breath and to look back on the bay
the shapes are distinct now two large open boats roughly made but menacingly adequate for their purpose coastal raiding
the boats are nearing the beach now and figures can be seen preparing to land
hector gathers enough of his wits and strength to continue his race up the hillside
inside his family are in a state of panic
they seem to have prepared for this moment
through their agitation there is purpose
they gather bits and pieces to carry with them in their flight
hectors children are attemp ting to take too much
hector shouts instructions to them as he puts more wood on the fire
it must stay burning in their absence
hector gathers his family together and they leave the cave
hector shoves his children in one direction up the slope further into the hills
his woman runs off the other way
a hasty confused argument takes place
up the hill
no down onto the other beach
the little ones cant take the hill
neither can i
up the hill
theyre down there already
i saw them
she runs off down the slope
hector has no choice but to follow her herding the children in front of him
deirdre runs on heading for the lower slope and the cover of some trees
then from these same trees she sees the figures of the raiders coming toward her
she turns running back up the hill
hector and the children also turn and run back the way they have come by now dropping precious bits of food and other possessions
the raiders are running strongly five or six of them
the little girl starts to go back for a precious toy she has dropped
hector picks her up and carries her off over his shoulder
the boy follows
deirdre is trailing behind them
she was right
she doesnt have the stamina for the hill
hector looks back and sees the raiders gaining on her
his face is a con fusion of fear and indecision
he almost stops as if to go back and help her but then changes his mind and runs off once again with the children
deirdre is by now throwing the things she is carrying at her pursuers hoping that they will stop to retrieve them and allow her to gain some ground
but they dont stop and the effort tires her even more
she attempts one final dash and then all of her energy gone she stops in her tracks and waits for her pursuers
the raiders break their run also and trot and finally walk the distance between them and deirdre
hector is watching all of this over his shoulder still running
he stops for a moment to watch deirdre being finally surrounded by the raiders
then he runs on
hector is tiring too
with the girl still awkwardly clinging to his neck he is picking his way up a steep slope half dragging the boy up behind him
he stops for a breath and sees the raiders moving into the valley below
in a moment of utter panic he lets go of his son drops the girl from his shoulder and runs on alone
we can sense the moment of release in his unburdened flight
but it doesnt last long
some way up the slope he stops and turns
he sees his children only now beginning to work out what has happened and the raiders below
he cant do it
even as the girl calls to him he is running back down the hill feeling the first stab of a guilt that will never leave him
come back dada
hector and the children have reached the safety of a small valley higher up in the hills
the raiders have been slowed down by their capture of deirdre
hector is hoisting his two children into the lower branches of a solitary tree on the hillside
he coaxes them up into the higher branches
dont move from here
ill come for you in the morning
theres no food
try and sleep in the branches
dont make a noise
hector moves off looking back to his children in the tree
they too gaze anxiously at him
they dont wave
maybe waving hasnt been invented yet
hector heads off alone higher into the hills
it is dusk now
we find hector waking from a fitful sleep behind some rocks
he sits up and takes in his surroundings
his face hardens as awareness of his pre dicament returns
he stands up and then crouching low moves off down the hill
hector has returned to the area of the tree
he slows down some distance away and just in time
he sees a figure standing beneath the tree
he moves forward to the protection of some rocks and watches
he is close enough to hear the voice of the solitary raider although he doesnt understand the words
the raider looks up into the branches and talks in a friendly persuasive way
its too cold to spend all night up there
weve got a fire at the beach
there is no response from the tree
the raider coaxes again
your mothers down there
shes warm too
she wants to see you
she sent me
his friendly tone of voice has an effect
there is movement in the branches
hector can see the dark shapes of his two children clambering down
the raider stretches out his arms and helps the boy to the ground
then he reaches up for the girl catches her as she drops and keeps her in his arms
he laughs in a comforting way
that was easy eh
youre half asleep already little girl
ill carry you
hector watches the raider and his children move slowly off down the hillside the raider carrying the girl in one arm and holding the boys hand
they almost look like a family
it is fully dark now
on the beach the raiders have set up a comfortable camp with a large fire
we are still with hector
he has come down from his bleak hiding place in the hills
the smell of fire and food and con cern for his family have drawn him here
he is hiding somewhere way off from the camp but close enough to observe it
what he sees disturbs him but for odd reasons
his family appear to be happily integrated with the raiders
his two children have become fast friends with the man who coaxed them from the tree
his woman is with a larger group closer to the fire
they are playfully attempting to communicate with her and although still a little timid she is smiling
there is no hint of bar barity rape or abuse
that was not the intention of the raiders
to them a fertile woman and two healthy children are as gold will be to plunderers of later ages
for their part the family have to accept the situation
food and shelter are the best that life can offer
painfully hector takes in the reality of the scene
his family have been stolen from him plain and simple
in the morning they will be gone out to sea and round the headland forever
he watches them for a while longer then it becomes too painful
he retreats into the dark ness and up into the empty hills again
hector spends a long cold night alone squatting in a narrow crevice in the rocks
he doesnt sleep or even attempt to close his eyes
he stares into the darkness
there is nothing in the world to comfort him no phi losophy or religion no friend to run to
this night he is utterly alone
in the morning it is lightly raining
hector stands in the drizzle outside the shelter
it seems to revive him refresh him even comfort him
a sign however meager that life goes on
then hector trots off in the direc tion of the shore
there is not much else that he can do
the raiders are loading up their boats wading back and forth from the shoreline
hector watches from cover
his family are already on one of the boats awaiting whatever lies ahead too afraid to betray real emotion
the last of the raiders on shore wade out the short dis tance to the boats
hector watches these moments of departure watches the faces of his family
hector makes his move
in a mad act he breaks cover and runs down toward the departing boats
the last raiders are climbing aboard
hector charges at full speed to the waters edge
he screams agonizingly at the raiders and impotently starts throwing stones at them
the raiders all look at him
the leader is impudently brushing hectors missiles aside like so many flies and smiling
suddenly hectors rage and energy leave him
he stands looking at the raiders and they look at him for a long moment
the raiders are all young men hardly into their twenties and nowadays might resemble something like a motorcycle gang
but in hectors time they are men in the full prime of life
they begin to laugh and exchange remarks about hector
he returns their looks fiercely
his woman and children sit on the boat frozen in fear
the leader eventually turns from hector still smiling and gives an order
the men lift their oars and prepare to leave
then an older man stands up in the other boat
he calls over to the leader nodding in the direction of hector
hector doesnt know what they are saying but they have an intense exchange obviously centered on him
the older man seems to be an adviser a priest or wise man although hes still only about thirty years old
the leader listens to him intently
the priest talks and points to the cliffs
the leader looks there and nods his head
he gives some instructions to his men
hector stands bemused
six or so of the raiders leave the boats wade ashore and without any resistance from him take hold of hector
hectors children instictively rise as if to defend their father but deirdre despite her own feelings wisely holds them back
hectors hands have been bound with rope
he is being led up to the top of the cliffs
the priest and the leader walk on ahead still talking intensely
at the top of the cliff the bay and the boats and the wide sea are stretched out beneath them
the priest as they arrive becomes excited
he points to a pile of large stones at the very summit of the headland
the mound of stones is obviously man made
i told you
i knew they did it around here
the leader moves closer to hector and talks to him in a friendly reasoning tone
what do we do
do we throw you over is that the idea
hector doesnt understand
he looks at him blankly
he wants me to throw you over
what does it do
does it help the sun
should i throw you over
the leader tries to help hector understand by miming the act of throwing him off the cliff
hector doesnt know how to respond
i tell you its one man one stone
itll help the voyage
the leader is unsure
he walks around the pile of stones checking it out from all sides as if it was some infernal machine that he didnt know the workings of
he squats down and squints through it to the watery sun emerging from the clouds far out to sea
he looks across to hector now sitting on the grass
the leader sits down beside him
they sit together like friends
the ageless intimacy of sacrificer and victim
whats it got to do with the sun
i dont know yet
the leader looks at hector
then he makes up his mind
its too much of a risk
just add a stone to the pile
let him go
thats the best we can do
with that he stands up
the priest with some sense of ceremony looks around for a large stone picks one up and places it on top of the pile
he waits for a moment almost as if he expects some consequence of his action
its meaningless without him going over the cliff
the leader strides off back toward the beach
the others follow him giving a final look or smile to hector apart from the priest who looks him up and down regretting that he is not by now a
corpse in the ocean
hector watches them go too shocked still to react in any mean ingful way
he stands alone trying to unpick the rope that binds his hands
when they are some distance from him hector starts to follow them at first running to catch up and then simply trotting after them
the raiders are aware of him behind them
the leader eventually stops and calls to hector
off you go
we dont want you
he turns from hector and moves on
hector persists in following them
they are his only connection now with anything that thinks or feels in the world
his link with them is all that is left
again and again the leader stops to shoo hector away but hector dumbly tags along behind
the raiders wade out to the waiting boats
hector follows to the very waters edge then stands and bleakly watches them
the raiders prepare to move off
hector is an embarrassment to them now
at the last moment the leader gives a brusque order to one of his men
the man clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again carrying a large flint bladed knife
he comes out of the water and walks up to hector
hector is beyond any form of reaction
he will take whatever is offered to him
the man comes close the knife held ready
he stands in front of hector for a moment
on the boat hectors family are tense with fear for his life
then the tense moment passes as the man grunts and nods at hectors hands still bound with rope
hector under stands
he lifts his hands and the man with some effort hacks through the rough hemp
then he turns and wades back to the boat
as the man clambers aboard the leader speaks to him
the man stops drops back into the water and returns to hector on the shore
he offers hector the cut piece of rope a weird gesture of conciliation
he even smiles
hector refuses the gift
the man stands sheepishly for a moment then drops the rope at hectors feet and wades back to the boat
a piece of rope in exchange for a family
hector watches them for some time his family and the strange raiders as they achingly slowly retreat from his view and his life
at last he turns and moves up from the shoreline
he goes some distance then stops thinks for a moment then retraces his steps
he goes back to the waters edge picks up the piece of rope that bound him and walks off with it
it might be of some use to him
hector has returned to his cave home now cold and empty of life
he is working on his instincts now still emotionally in shock
he digs around in the embers of the fire
some of the larger bits of wood still hold some life
hector bends low and starts to waft expertly and blow at the fires remains
we leave our first hector squatting at his fire in the simplest act of physical survival
for him the problems of emotional survival without his family lie ahead
this is another bigger fire
in fact we might be in hell
a crude furnace blazes
filthy sweat covered men feed it with wood and charcoal an endless task given the ferocity of the fire
to one side of the oppressive low ceilinged furnace room some small boys endlessly toil at two large bellows feeding the flames with jets of air
over the noise of the furnace someone is whistling an odd human sound in an inhuman setting
shadowy figures come and go with barrow loads of wood
we tilt up to the space above the furnace to see a mass of dangerously crude clay pipes oozing water and steam at every joint
above the heat and filth there is a different world
a clean beautifully tiled world of lazing figures droning conversations and resonant laughter
it is the hot room of a bathhouse somewhere in the roman empire
we have advanced years into the future and it shows in the technology
it is mens day at the bathhouse
all of the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and comfortable with themselves
slaves wait in attendance some around the edge of the pool others in the water rubbing backs and massaging shoulders
there are three or four times as many slaves as bathers and the proprie torial way that they look after their masters gives the place the odd atmosphere of a
kindergarten for over indulged grown ups
and then we find our hector
he stands against the wall holding a large towel
although clean shaven and more healthy looking we can still recognize hector more so by the look in his eyes
there is a set to his face that tells us he is a man alone emotionally detached from his surroundings
he is a personal body slave
he watches his master in the pool alert to any hint of need that he might have
hectors master lucinnius is not as relaxed as the others around him
he is in anxious conversation with an older man wading beside him
we dont hear what they are saying but there is enough body language to detect lucinnius pleading and the older mans cool distraction
the older man gives a final dismissive shake of his head
hector immediately moves to the side of the pool with the towel as lucinnius climbs out of the water
im going to the cool room
hector wraps the towel around his master and follows him a look of concern on his face
lucinnius worries are hectors also
hector walks a pace behind lucinnius through various chambers of the bathhouse passing the games area and the massage room as they go
all around them slaves attend to their pampered masters
after an anxious scan of the cool room lucinnius goes towards three men occupying a marble bench
hector as if by magic produces a small wooden stool for his master to sit on as he joins the others
hector then moves out of earshot but still alert to his masters behavior
lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to casually join his friends
the eldest of the three gives off as much of the aura of a godfather as a naked man in a towel can
the other two are deferential to the older man and treat lucinnius with apparent con tempt
hector watches the older man put a paternal hand on lucciniuss shoulder and speak with a calm smile on his face
hector almost winces to see his master submit to this patronizing treatment
slave and master exist so closely together that many of their feelings are shared
more precisely lucinniuss feelings are shared by hector
it is a one way exchange
from morning until night and probably in his dreams too hector is living two lives his own and his masters
here in ancient rome is this what they call classic schizophrenia
as luccinius stands to leave we can tell by their expres sions that the three men are open in their contempt for him
hector is quickly on his feet and by lucinniuss side as he goes
a final sarcastic remark comes from one of the three
well washed lucinnius
lucinnius tries to muster his dignity as they leave
this is not the grandeur of rome but the dusty main street of a provincial capital in greece or spain or north africa
it is difficult to tell from the people because they are such a cosmopolitan crowd faces from every corner of the mediterranean world
it has some thing of the atmosphere of a frontier town in a western except that here the half finished buildings are made of brick and stone
lucinnius leaves the bathhouse
hector follows three paces behind him loaded down with the large towel the scrubber robe and the wooden stool
the stool goes with them everywhere in case lucinnius has to stop in the street and converse with a friend
other notables are among the street throng their own slaves tagging along behind with their little wooden stools
some have whole trains of slaves shadowing them
human status symbols
lucinnius stops near some street stalls
hector stops beside him
bad omens hector
get me something to eat
just a mouse or two
hector places the stool at lucinniuss feet and moves off
lucinnius sits down still absorbed in his problems
hector keeps an eye on lucinnius as he orders the food
and some bread
two chicken legs then cold and the bread
as hector is given the food and pays for it he sees another man julian approach lucinnius trailed by two slaves
one of them is carrying a folding chair much more substantial than lucinniuss
julian and lucinnius greet one another and sit down to talk lucinnius at something of a height disadvantage
the two slaves move off to one side
lucinniuss mood has brightened since the arrival of his friend
their conversation seems open and friendly
hector gives his master his food and then moves to join the two slaves hearing a snatch of the conversation as he goes
of course youre free to call at my house at anytime but i was receiving nepos
how could i admit you
hector offers to share his bread with the other two slaves
they easily fall into conversation inevitably about their masters
spoiled his day meeting your man
hes been avoiding him all week
his ships have gone too we heard
this is news to hector
when did you hear
theyre sunk he reckons
that could finish him eh
this is the worst its been
youll be up for sale before you know it
this makes them laugh hector less so than the other two
the other two nod their heads
at the baths
i could tell
they smelled blood
if hed pulled it off hed be in rome by now
and you with him
hector nods his head thoughtfully
and me with him
half way home
lucinnius and his friend stand and exchange their final words unaware of the scrutiny they have been under or so used to it that they are oblivious to it
hector and the slaves hurry to gather up the seats and take their positions behind their masters
the casualness of their conversation has gone and they resume the formality of their roles
lucinnius is eager to talk and tosses his words over his shoulder to hector
hes a true friend probably the only one i have left
hector obligingly trots a step or two closer to lucinnius to aid their conversation
will he lend you the money
he was honest about it
he said so plain and simple
thats a problem
lucinnius unburdens himself
and the ships have gone
did i tell you that
cyprian knows already
hell want his money back too
we can see the concentration on hectors face as he concocts appropriate responses
he has a tough occupation being the alter ego to an ambitious loser in one of the most competitive and dangerous societies ever to exist
and he has to carry the stool and the towel as well
when we get home i want you to get some chickens
and fetch hermas the diviner
at home we find lucinnius and hector with the diviner hermas
they are gathered around a shrine in the large public room
the entrails of a chicken lie on a slab of marble
hermas prods them with a knife
he makes much of the mysteries of his craft as if it were a skill beyond ordinary men
the other two peer over his shoulders
suitably mysti fied lucinnius talks in a reverent low voice
are my ships from sicily still afloat
hermas tetchily stops him
offer the grain first
sprinkle it on the altar
and we cant ask the gods specific questions like that
its a gentle probing enquiry
but lets see
he cuts into the chicken liver and prods around the in side
the other two wait in silence
what do you mean
i mean no
the liver says no
do it again
i want you to do it again
is it the gods will
be well disposed towards me
in the future
if you want to do it again you need another chicken and another fifteen sesterces
and id like the first fifteen now please
hector looks a lucinnius who nods reluctantly
hector opens his purse and counts out the coins for hermas
hector is giving lucinnius a soothing shoulder massage
lucinnius is still in a talking mood
his troubles wont allow him to relax
cyprian loaned me half a million to fit out these ships
just when things were going well
i had plans for you too hector
in four or five years i was going to make you a free man
and then in ten years youd be a citizen
you couldve found your family
brought them here
hector smiles ruefully
it sounds good
lucinnius misses the irony in hectors voice and enthuses about his own future generosity
it does doesnt it
lucinnius is silent for a while as hector continues to rub his shoulders
i shouldnt give up
ill visit cyprian first thing tomorrow
before the others can get to him
hes got to see reason
i can pay him back
its the only chance we have hector
should i do it
this burst of resolve has relaxed lucinnius
his tense muscles yield more to hectors fingers
thalia enters the room
she is a household slave a nubian from africa
she carries a lighted torch and moves around the room lighting the wall lamps
lucinnius watches her
thalia i think i need one of your massages
hector you can finish the lamps
hector does as he is told
he takes the torch from thalia and discreetly leaves the room hearing lucinnius as he closes the door
late at night hector is still awake
he rises from his bed and quietly moves out of the room
he is careful not to disturb the sleeping forms lying all around him some of them sprawled on the floor
he shares his bed room with at least eight other slaves
privacy is a masters privilege
in the darkened house hector makes his way up some stairs and along a passage
the only sound is a crack or two of far away thunder
at the end of the passage hector finds a small ladder propped against the wall
he climbs this and lifts open the trap door above his head
odd flashes of lightning far out to sea are the only source of light as hector moves across the flat roof
in one corner he sees what he is looking for the outline of a figure resting against the low parapet wall
he moves towards it
the figure speaks
i missed you last night
it is thalia
we can tell that they are close
hector sits down beside her
he kept me working until morning
he has no money and a lot of enemies
if hes very clever hell survive
but the omens are bad
and hes not very clever
she doesnt like him
you get people like that
clumsy and sad
thalia looks out towards the sea
why does the thunder always stay out on the ocean
hector puts an arm around thalia
at first it feels strange their physical intimacy alongside their matter of fact conversation but gradually we understand it the giving and taking of comfort where it can be found
and the realness of their friendship
their stroking and touching and holding becomes good to watch
we get a feeling for what they have given one another in stolen hours and half hours up here on the roof the only place where they can be themselves
its the gods arguing
theyre working out what to do with lucinnius
hell be lying awake down there
wondering what theyre saying about him
far away some street dogs bark
if he goes down ill ask for my freedom
he owes it to me
he said as much
we could be free
what we talk about
by now he is kissing her
we talk about going home
yours is that way and mine is that way
your family is that way
i just made that up
i dont know which way they are
anyway you cant think like that
not after so many years
its what you talk about
we talk about it because it can never happen
what we do is you and me
i dont understand
i think youll leave
youre going to leave me here
its you and me now
we stay here
hector is silent still kissing her
he yawns as he speaks
then i can see you every night
hector is back in his bed
a figure enters the room steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes him awake
hector comes to
lucinnius stands over him whispering
i cant sleep
get me a chicken
i want to make another sacrifice
well do it ourselves
hector wearily takes himself out of bed and follows lucinnius out of the room
hector is in the henhouse in the dark selecting a chicken for sacrifice
he is about to leave when he sees a man and woman arms around each other sitting in a corner
the man looks at the white hen hector is holding
cant you find a woman hector
he isnt surprised to see them
they are only doing what he and thalia do on the roof
the slaves have their meeting places scattered all over the house
sorry to trouble you
just fetching a chicken
good night the roofs free
the man shakes his head with a smile
hector leaves the sleepy chicken going to meet her fate in his arms
come on miss you can tell lucinnius his future
hector and lucinnius are approaching the home of cyprian
hector as usual is walking some paces behind his master and he carries a large satchel of documents
cyprians home is a street palace
it is early in the morning but there is already activity around the house visitors coming and going messengers petitioners
a few impor tant callers arrive in litters carried by slaves
lucinnius and hector even have to join a line at the door and are checked in by the gateman
lucinniuss hopes of quietly bending cyprians ear are dashed
it seems as if the whole world owes allegiance to this provincial mr
the slaves gather on one side of the courtyard gossiping and playing games of chance on the ground
their masters wait on the other side of the courtyard seated on benches along the wall
cyprians aides usher the visitors into his presence in a regular flow some have an audience of a few minutes others last merely seconds
hector keeps an eye on lucinnius like a mother watching her child from a distance on its first day at school
lucinnius sitting expectantly in line does look a little pathetic even ridiculous
straight backed hands on knees alert worried he looks a bit like a sacri ficial offering himself
hector plays a game of five stone with some other slaves as he watches lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by place to the front of the line
we almost expect hector to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is finally summoned into the inner office
the first signs seem good
lucinnius doesnt emerge within the first minute
cyprian is at least giving him the time of day
more minutes pass
hector watches a game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door
one or two others familiar to us from the bathhouse go into the office
so does lucinnius friend julian
eventually lucinnius emerges into the sunlight a broad smile on his face
hector relaxes and leaves the ball game to join him
you look happier
relieved that its over at last
lucinnius strides out of the courtyard with hector following after him
lucinnius and hector are walking home in their usual formation
hector is closer than normal so that they can talk
will he help you
i have to kill myself by tomorrow morning
he has all my letters to titinius none of them got through
he says its like treason
and he says i should want to die for owing him half a million anyway
hector is shocked
what if you dont
then he will
and that wouldnt be pleasant
he would drag me to rome
lucinnius shivers to think of them
im done for hector
but its strange
i feel kind of good about it
the struggle is over weve seen it through together eh
i dont know what to say
lets get home
we have a lot to do
lucinnius quickens his pace
peace at last
lucinnius is obviously in a state of shock
hector and lucinnius are in his study
lucinnius is busy clearing up his papers
he is less hysterical than in the previous scene more aware of the reality of what he has to do
well do it with a knife hector
when everyone has gone to bed
the two of us to the end
i dont understand
what do you want me to do
i dont think i can help you
well help each other hector
weve been through this whole mess together
we must die together
i dont know what you mean
you dont understand do you
im asking you to die with me
youre my closest my dearest slave
what would they say about me if you refused to die with me
this is honor
were choosing death
were not going to submit to the humiliations that cyprian can heap on us are we
you say we
i dont know
what is we
ive done nothing
i know nothing
lucinnius changes his tone becomes more in his own mind frank man to man
at cyprians this morning i had to sign certain papers tell a bit of a story
what kind of story
that we were plotting against cyprian and the provincial senate
we were short of names
most of the people i know were in the room
people i thought were my friends
so i mentioned you
i had to
hector is stunned with shock
so im a conspirator
so you see i dont want you to die with me just because of my honor
its more complicated
im sorry hector
i would be honored
if you would die with me
i mean it
hector manages to speak
can i sit down
this is the worst its been
hector is in the inner courtyard of the house beside the kitchen
he is talking to gallus who is lucinniuss ten year old son
hector has a close friendship with him
as we listen to their conversation it becomes clear that hector finds comfort in the boy for the family that he lost
today there is an air of distraction about hector
understandable considering his scheduled death
the kitchen slaves come and go as they talk
but even if its round you can still fall off the edge
hector has picked up a large metal plate to help him make his point
its not round like that
its round like this
gallus sees his playball
he picks it up
do you believe everything that greek tells you
gallus ignores this tease intent on the ball
rome must be right in the middle
and we must be out here somewhere
hector becomes more interested
so where is my home
how many months did they march you here
gallus walks out the distance from rome with his fingers as if there is serious calculation
it must be about here
his fingers stop on the other side of the ball
but then youd be upside down
i wasnt upside down
and how could you see the sun round there i saw the sun at home
gallus is stumped for answers
ill ask him tomorrow
hector remembers that he and the boys father are supposed to die that night
he looks on gallus with a new tenderness
yes tell me tomorrow
id like to know
because my children are round there and i want to know that theyre getting the sun
ask him something else too
where are the gods if the whole thing is round
i think i know that
theyre out here and all around
thats how they can look down and see everything
lucinnius is at it again
in the lamplight a live chicken stands on the altar
hector and lucinnius watch it as if their lives depended on it
perhaps they do
if he eats the grain it means yes
he scatters some grain on the table
the chicken at once begins to peck them up
its saying yes
theres a way
no its saying yes we should die
but you asked it if we had to die or if there was another way
its saying yes there is
no its saying yes we should die
the bird is certainly enjoying his food
maybe its just hungry
the chicken is inscrutable as they are prone to be
a dead chicken adorns lucinniuss table
he and his wife dalmia and their son are lying on their couches picking at the food with their fingers
lucinnius is drinking more wine than usual
hector and the other household slaves are in attendance
thalia is also there serving her mistress
dalmia knows something is up but she doesnt know what
she attempts to break the silence
she calls on the cook from the kitchen
the kitchen slave quickly appears
im eating chicken again
i ate chicken yesterday and the day before
will i be eating chicken again tomorrow
why am i always eating chicken
solus looks up at lucinnius and hector but they offer him no help
its what we have to hand in the kitchen maam
i always try to use the fresh stuff
the chickens have just been turning up
he looks again at lucinnius and hector
they look at each other
thalia looks at hector
dalmia looks at them all looking at each other more intrigued than she was before
a slave interrupts them
two men have come to see you
lucinnius and hector look at each other and share a moment of hope
they might be coming with good news perhaps a softening of cyprians heart
the two visitors that await lucinnius and hector are an unpromising sight
they are big men unsophisticated and look uncomfortable in their well cut togas
a couple of the godfathers foot soldiers
they greet lucinnius deferentially but he knows that they would break his back at the whim of their master
good evening lucinnius
cyprian asked us if we could be of any assistance
in the business that you have to conduct tonight
to make that business as
as you could wish
lucinnius sighs as his last hope expires
thank you gentlemen
but i feel that i will be capable of taking care of my affairs tonight without your help
thank cyprian for his kind thought
the heavies metaphorically keep their foot in the door
were spending the night at the house of nepos not far from here
dont hesitate to send your man for us
at any time
were anxious that things should go well for you
well call in the morning at any rate
just to make sure
hector is closing the door when one of the visitors talks roughly to him
hector instinctively looks to his master
lucinnius doesnt protest but retreats into the house
hector is left alone with the visitors
he looks like the kind thatll want some help
have you ever killed before
hes not much different
use a thin blade but long
get it in deep
feel for a space between the ribs
he prods at hectors body freely showing him what to do
if it is ticklish hector doesnt let on
or go in from the back
any place hell let you
we leave hector nodding obediently as this weirdest of coaching lessons continues
getting it outs not as easy as you might think
you have to twist a bit
to get over the stickiness
late at night in lucinniuss study an oil lamp and a candle cast their shadowy light adding to the tension in the room
hector stands beside lucinnius who is counting out coins and other valuables on his table
eight hundred sesterces
cash thats all thats left
what a failure
my father left me three farms and forty thousand
lucinnius places the money in a box on his table
he is quite drunk resigned now to his fate
hector however is cold sober grim faced
lucinnius looks up at him
nothing else to be done
dont you want some wine
but i want something
what is it
i want to die a free man
i dont want to die a slave
lucinnius looks at him grimly and manages a smile
he clears his throat and attempts to put a note of ceremony into his voice
hector by this proclamation i make you a freed man
i dont know the exact words
ive never done it before
but youre free hector
so that when they find me
they know i died a free man
lucinnius looks at him for a moment then reaches out for his paper and pen
he scratches out a few words on the paper hector looking over his shoulder keenly watching what he writes
lucinnius finishes writing and lays down the pen
theyll find it in the morning
its a nice thought hector
you were right to ask
freed man lets do it
lucinnius picks up a large kitchen knife which lies on the table
he fingers its blade
a trickle of fear passes across hectors face
will the half drunk lucinnius want to kill him first
what do you want me to do
i mean not to me
i have to do it first
you understand that
and then you
if i dont succeed
then you must help me
no point in messing up the room
lets go downstairs
lucinnius stands and leaves the room
hector follows with the oil lamp
the house is quiet and in darkness as they walk along the passage and down the stairs to the washing room
hector walks behind casting the light on lucinniuss crumpled defeated form
lucinnius begins to sob at first quietly then more loudly and more pathetically
hector looks around and behind him afraid or perhaps hoping that lucinniuss moans will wake the household
lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of distress with drink and terror and self pity
he runs into the tiled washing room wails loudly and makes a stabbing motion at his stomach
hector sees all of this from behind as he enters the room
lucinnius crumples to the floor and squats on his knees
he calls out in pain
oh that hurts that stings
lucinnius sits back on the step of the washing pool holding his stomach
hector sits down beside him
they both look down at the blade still in lucinnius body
this is hopeless
they sit absurdly like this for a long moment neither of them knowing what do do next
its awkward like in a waiting room
then lucinnius speaks
help me hector
youve done it
youve done it lie down
hector speaks gently like coaxing a frightened animal
he helps lucinnius lie out on the marble floor
close your eyes
you did it
thank you thank you
the movement has increased the spread of blood over lucinnius clothing
he raises his head
you do it now hector
do it hector
it looks as if hector is playing for time
ill need the knife
lucinnius voice is fading now
hector waits then reaches down for the knife in lucinnius stomach
we see on his face the effort as he pulls at it and do we detect a subtle twisting of the blade to speed lucinnius on his way
lucinnius sighs and twitches a little
its as if the life flows out of him as the knife is released from the wound
his voice is even more faint
do it hector
hector has the knife in his hand but still he waits looking at lucinnius willing the last dregs of life from him
the whispers fade to a croak
lucinnius lies still
hector has won this final battle of wills
he stands up suddenly repulsed by what has happened
but quickly he gathers his wits
he makes his decision
he throws the knife down
it clatters along the hard shiny floor
hector has run out of the room before it has come to rest against the wall
hector runs into the study and makes for the box contain ing the coins
he puts most of them into a leather money bag and ties it to his waist
then he pulls on lucinniuss cloak and rushes out of the room
he returns quickly to pick up his certificate of freedom from the table
then just as he is leaving he again stops sits down on the chair pulls off his worn shoes and places on his feet a pair of lucinniuss stout street
hector is walking quickly from the kitchen across the courtyard to the street gate
near the gate he stops and looks back at the house
he makes a decision and retraces his steps across the courtyard and back into the house
thalia is sleeping in a large pallet bed on the floor with two other women
hector gently shakes her shoulder trying not to wake the others
after a moment or two thalia opens her eyes
hector whispers to her before she has time to open her mouth
come now if you want to
but we must hurry
im a free man
will you come
the shadowy cloaked figures making their way down to the harbor are hector and thalia
nearer the harbor we sense the nighttime work of loading and preparing ships for the morning tide
by the light of oil lamps cargos are manhandled aboard voices shout winches creak
hector encounters a night watchman but diverts his suspicion by boldly addressing him
i have some mail for tyre
where are the east bound ships
ask at the harbor
with an authoritative nod hector strides off in the direction of the noise and lights thalia at his heels
hector talks when the watchman is out of earshot
we want a timber ship
they go west
straight to rome
then you go home
hector hurries on noncommittal in his reply
you can go to anywhere from rome
hector and thalia approach a ship heavily laden with timber
final supplies are being carried aboard super vised by two men on the quay
hector approaches them
where is the captain
hes on the ship
he indicates a man standing on the rear deck
hector and thalia climb up the gangplank and approach him
good morning captain
im looking for passage to rome for both of us
and who might you be
im the steward of lucinnius the merchant
we have business in rome
i need an immediate passage
its five or six days
you can walk or ride from there
you have money
well lets see
passage for two
food for two
what were you thinking of offering
when do you leave
anxious to leave are you
keen to start yes
hector and thalia are asleep huddled together in a cor ner of the ship that they have claimed as their quarters
a crewman comes and shakes hector awake
he stirs himself to the sounds of a ship underway the sounds of the sea wash the wind in the canvas the moans of the timbers
captain says to come on deck
hector wakes thalia and they clamber out of the darkness of the hold onto the brightest freshest of days at sea
there is no sign of land behind them
the ship is moving swiftly in a strong clean breeze and a light sea
we can tell from thalias reactions that she has never been out at sea before at least never above deck
every thing is novel to her and it shows even the movement of the ship
her excitement is childlike
wheres the land gone
hector too is taken by the novelty of it all but is less prepared to admit it
he waves his hands around the empty horizon noncommittally
have you been on a ship before
yes of course
we can tell he is lying
me too but they kept us down there
she points down into the lower depths of the hold
then she gets even more excited
well be where the thunder is
they look at each other and then all around them
the freshness of the day and on an overwhelming feeling of freedom exhilarate them
their senses and their feelings are in new territory
they are like children in a brand new world
the captain on the other side of the ship beckons them
thought you would like to see them
he points to three shapes in the mid distance ships heading for the port they have left
there is a thrill in their glamor their fine progress under full sail
your masters ships
they cant be
no theyre not
i know these ships
my brother in laws the master of the big one with the brown sail
hector and thalia look at each other
the captain smiles at them and looks back to the ships coursing healthily on their way
somebody been putting the wind up lucinnius
thats an old one
didnt think anybodyd fall for that
later the ship is still making brisk progress
thalia and hector are sitting on deck some distance from one another
they are quieter now more thoughtful
hector catches her eye
hector is drawn by her smile and moves to join her
they sit quietly absorbed in thought thoughts of each other their looks and smiles tell us that
as if they are talking without words
hector looks around him
a sailor on the forward deck is sorting out some rope an echo of a previous time and place
the wind catches the sailors hat
he grabs it from the air and spends time arranging it once more on his head just so
a tiny human moment
a man is driving a heavy two horse wagon
the wind has just lifted his hat from his head
he spends some time replacing it carefully just so
watching him from the back of the wagon is hector
the drama of the lives of thalia and hector has played itself out long ago
between the breath of sea breeze that lifted the hat of the roman sailor and the gust of mountain wind that snatches the hat of the wagoner lies years
hector sits in the wagon beside a woman
there are tantalizing similarities between their situation and the one we left thalia and hector in on the boat a few moments ago years ago
the woman and hector exchange glances now and then delicate signals of mutual awareness
talking without words
they are not alone in the wagon perched on its half load of timber
with them is a nun accompanying a girl of about eight
the girl is tearful
a man his face unseen is snoring underneath his hat
a younger man gaunt and hungry looking is dressed in the rough travelling clothes of a monk or priest
even without his habit we would know he was a holy man
his incessant talk tells us
we want to praise god because we live in this ultimate age when all things are done all is known all the wonders of his creation revealed to us
nothing more for man to see or do
all that is left is the hope of salvation
even for our humbler sisters
the girl is sobbing through all of this
yes weep child weep for joy
you are a glorious example to us all
already a child of gods
blessed to spend your earthly days within his church as christs servant
what generous parents you have
giving you to the sisters
what a sacrifice
there is an irish lilt to his voice which colors what he is saying with a tinge of mischief
he is a difficult fellow to pin down
hector looks at him amusedly still sharing his thoughts silently with the woman beatrice
the nun interrupts the priest cheerfully
shes already received the last rites before she left her family
she belongs to god now
the child sobs more noisily
fortunate child destined for paradise
untouched by the abiding curse of carnal lust
i struggle against it
i will not join myself carnally with any woman
he looks accusingly at beatrice
i will carry my unspilt seed from this world to the next
as should every man
now hector is getting the hard looks from the priest
if all men forsook forever the fleshy temptations
and held womankind to barrenness
think how much the sooner would come the day of judgement
all gods chosen gathered in paradise
ive written a small treatise in favor of virginity sister
we could discuss it later if you like
the driver of the wagon turns his head briefly to the priest
what are you talking about
hector gestures to beatrice that he is leaving the wagon to walk for a while and asks her to join him
she shakes her head with a smile
hector smiles too then jumps down from the wagon and walking slowly allows it to gain ground in front of him
the ramblings of the priest fade away
its simple brother
if we cease carnal union entirely then in fifty or so years well all be rid of our earthly lives and god can proceed with his reign over his heavenly
that same paradise that god gave to man before but which man was so unfit to inhabit that within seven hours eve was already tempting her master and mate and
within nine hours the lord had to expel the both of them
just think they messed it up in nine hours
hector smiles as the priests voice fades into the dis tance
it is a cold fresh day of early summer
they are travelling high in the mountains
hector dawdles on his way eating a hard biscuit he takes from his pocket
the last sound he hears from the wagon is the renewed wailing of the girl
hector lays himself down at the side of the road
his eyes begin to close
then a sound in the distance makes him open them again
more sounds drift up to him from the floor of the valley
he stands up and crosses the track
at first he can see nothing
he walks back along the rim of the road
then he sees where the noise is coming from
a mounted skirmish is in progress just where a wooden bridge crosses the small river at the very bottom of the valley
there are no more than knights in full armor with twice as many foot soldiers and squires
even from such a distance hector can see and hear that the fighting is ferocious almost insane in its intensity
from this distance it is like a puppet show except the violence is real
the scene places hector in his time and for us there is a strange feeling to it almost as if hector has awoken from sleep and found himself transported to
some distant age
but this is not the case
hector is where he belongs in medieval europe
hector makes his decision
with a last look behind him he runs off in the direction of the wagon
like any wise citizen of a violent age hector knows when to leg it
hector catches up with the moving wagon and jumps onto it happily back in the security of his fellow travellers
he smiles at beatrice
a bit cold
she smiles at him
he sits opposite her in the wagon and allows his foot to touch hers
she doesnt move away
hector calls to the driver
how long to get there
when it gets dark well be there
hector looks at beatrice
i thought i heard fighting
beatrice replies but in a language that hector doesnt understand
i dont know what youre saying
i havent understood anything youve said all day
hector talks back to her
i dont know what youre saying
they both smile
it doesnt seem to disturb them too much that they dont share a language
they repeat their incomprehensible statements just for the fun of it
i dont know what youre saying
i dont understand
beside hector the girl has stopped sobbing but she is still troubled
she turns to him and speaks quietly but with determination
i want to go home to my mother
hector doesnt know how to respond
he can do nothing to help her and anyway is more interested in beatrice
it is almost dark when the wagon finally turns into the yard of the farm where they will spend the night
the farmer and his wife have laid out a table with simple food a stew bread and wine
the travellers settle down to eat
the priest however makes a performance out of his more modest needs
he calls loudly to the wife working at the open fire
just bread and water for me mistress
i have no need of wine or meat
she brings him a jug of water and he makes much of giving thanks to god for his simple meal muttering his grace quietly to himself excluding all others from
his conver sation with the almighty
in the dark sleeping bodies lie all over the floor of an upstairs room
gentle snores and regular breathing lay a blanket of soft sound over the human forms
one of the forms stirs and sits up on one elbow
hector in another corner of the room sleeping lightly becomes aware of this
he watches as the figure stands up and picks its way between the bodies to the door
the figure pauses and crouches over beatrice
hector can hear the distinct sounds of the figure sniffing her from head to toe and then a deep long sigh
the figure stands up and moves quietly to the door disappearing downstairs
hector rouses himself and follows the other
hector creeps cautiously into the dark kitchen
the figure has gone to the pantry and can be heard rummaging there
hector creeps closer and sees that it is the priest
he already has a chicken leg between his teeth as he hunts for a cup for the jar of wine tucked under his arm
he emerges from the pantry
he sees hector standing by the table
they recognize one another and relax
the priest doesnt re enter his holy act
he speaks normally cheekily
god im starving
do you think i dare heat that up on the fire
he indicates the large pot containing the remains of the stew
ill eat it cold
i deserve to suffer
he pours some wine into the cup and slides it across the table to hector
then he digs his hands into the cold stew and eats chunks of meat as they talk
have some wine
hector takes a drink
i saw some fighting today
back up the road
so the mad knights are at it again
what were they swiss or english
i dont know
they all look the same to me
it might help us get through
if theres a bit of confusion
well still travel separately though for now
the priest changes his tone of voice mocking his own holy act
but hector you must keep out of the way of temptation
i saw the way you were eyeing up that widow
now stay away from that
although she is beautiful is she not
but were going home remember
hector is smiling
how do you know shes a widow
look at her eyes
she could lead you into trouble
she smells like paradise though
he changes his tone yet again
he talks straight
listen hector lets get this clear
if anyones going to dally with that widow itll be me
you couldnt handle her
shed bewitch you
at any rate youre not a sinning kind of fellow are you
why dont you get off up the road tomorrow and ill catch you up in five or so days
hector doesnt answer but smiles
the priest has stirred thoughts that he had intended to dampen entirely
youre not a sinning fellow remember
another month and well be at the channel then home
the little ones you only talk about when youre drunk
dont forget them
hector still remains silent
the priest is worried
why do i always talk so much
you werent even thinking of her til i opened my mouth
but i trust you
i know you wouldnt do anything to anger your god or me
get me some bread
hector obeys the priest without thought
the priest is happier now that he is in control again
who saved your neck in venice
you did ronald
hector approaches the priest with the bread
and dont you forget it
he raises his cup to hector
may the lord forgive us our sins those we have committed and those we as yet only dream of
shes a glory of a woman
for all his wit and endless talk we can sense a trace of vulnerabililty in ronald
for all his bluster there is the feeling that he needs hector as much as he claims hector needs him
overnight the remnants of a company of soldiers fresh from battle have collected in the courtyard
some are tired dispirited others are wounded
our travellers watch from the farm window
a few mounted knights come into the yard herding in front of them a small group of prisoners well dressed knights and squires
the travellers look out on the exciting scene and talk as they eat their breakfast of bread and milk
hostages too theyve got
they only take the rich ones
he turns to the forlorn girl
have you ever seen so many fine rich men my girl
hector talks to the company but means his words for the priest
i wont be travelling today
the priest looks him straight in the eye
the fightings behind us brother youll be safe enough
hector shakes his head catching beatrices eye
you should go
the nun puts an arm around the girl
god will protect his ewe lambs
suddenly the door is thrown open and four soldiers man handle an inert body dressed in full armor into the room
they scatter the food from the table and lay out the moaning suit of armor on it
a young squire follows them in and kneels by the knight in the suit
the moans are muffled because the knights helmet has been battered out of shape in the battle and cant be removed
the ugly dent suggests an equally ugly wound inflicted on the head inside
the soldiers gingerly try to remove the helmet
their efforts are useless
blood oozes from the joints of the helmet
the moaning suit of armor seems inhuman robot like
must be sore in there
is it your dada
the squire looks at him and nods his head
hector looks with sympathy at the boy
if hes got a little head it might be alright
has your dada got a big head
an officer comes into the room
is there a blacksmith here
wheres the smith
in the village sir half a day away
the officer looks at the moaning suit of armor then at the astonished group of travellers
he picks on the priest
you priest come here
get to work on him
hes not ready for heaven yet
theres a hundred thousand livres on his head if i get him to paris alive
theres fifteen livres in it for you if he lives
the priest obediently goes up to the knight and starts to pray earnestly
the officer turns to the soldiers
get that helmet off
get hammers anything you can find
and one of you get back down into the valley and fetch an armorer
the soldiers scatter to carry out their orders
hector takes time to watch the squire still kneeling beside his father quietly stroking the helmet
ronald the priest mutters every prayer he can remember
the suit of armor twitches and moans
hector looks at beatrice and motions for her to follow him outside
the priest looks on helplessly as they slide past the table and head for the door
more soldiers have continued to make their way to the shelter of the farm
everywhere is the chaos of war
wounded men lie awaiting the attentions of either the medicos or the priest
prisoners huddle in cowed groups
everyone looks for food
individual soldiers like lost souls run here and there trying to regroup with their comrades
the youngest are squires of twelve or thir teen the oldest are red faced overweight knights in expensive armor
hector and beatrice have found a quiet corner where they can sit and talk
behind them is a group of soldiers reserves who have not yet joined the battle
they are much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci plined unit
their movements are a strange cross between parade ground drill and battle training
to the beat of drums they perform rhythmic hypnotic movements repeating the same pattern over and over again
a deadly dance thrusting their pikes in unison
they become like one evil inhuman machine
it is mesmerizing to watch all the more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that hector and beatrice are acting out
they have the problem of not sharing a language but resourceful as lovers are they soon employ this as another titillating element in their love play
i think you know what im saying a little
no i dont i dont understand a word
how come you dont speak like anyone else
are you far from home
where you sleep and live
i think i know what you mean
im far from home too
way way over there
then across the sea
youre losing me again
have you ever seen the sea
right to the end of the world
i come from the other side of the little water then theres the big big water
i had a friend who sailed on that
went too far
fell right over the edge
they never came back
they fell off the world
hector smiles pleased with himself
you think thats funny
its a sad story
you shouldnt laugh
talk about home again
remember you said home
im not making sense am i
well lets go back to homes
thats where im going
ive been away for too long
some people locked me up
i had to run away
tell me something else
we have to learn to talk the same
try it like me say it
i know what youre saying
youre saying home
say something else
you want the word for home
i dont want your word for home i want you to say mine
come on you can do it
beatrice has her way turning the tables on hector
he says it in her language
in this tiny victory the dynamic of their relationship is set
they fall silent suddenly shy
beatrice breaks this moment by reaching out to hectors neck very delicately like a caress
there first touch
then it changes
beatrice completes her movement with a sharp grab at hectors hair and pinches her fingers on something
triumphantly she shows him the flea she has caught
its a tick
beatrice looks at him directly now their intimacy well under way
bet theres more in there
you need a good going over
nobodys been looking after you
she ruffles his hair in a motherly but then again sex ually provocative way
he understands her well now
why dont we go somewhere and have a good session
i could do you
id like to give you a good grooming
they understand each other perfectly now
they look around for a more private spot
ronald the priest still kneels by the inert knight in armor
the boy squire still sits by his fathers head
ronald mumbles quietly to himself in prayer
the knight is deathly still no sight or sound of breathing or moaning
the suit of armor seems to grow even more rigid as we look at it
there is no sense of it containing life
the officer re enters the room from outside
how is he
at peace for the moment
leave him for a while
there are a few souls out here you can help on their way to heaven
ten sous a soul to you
the officer leaves
ronald quickly follows him outside
twenty sous is normal
how many are there
when they have gone the squire gives his father a nudge but there is no response from the knight just the impression of lifeless bulk
hector and beatrice have found some privacy near the trees and by a low wall
some bushes hide them from full view of the farm yard
hector is sitting cross legged and beatrice kneels behind him giving his head a thorough going over
mutual grooming is the original and perhaps the best form of foreplay
hector certainly likes it
yes it does feel good
she gives his scalp a final delicious rub and then stops
you can do me now
beatrice loosens her clothing to bare her neck and shoulders
hector begins to probe her hair and scalp
she arches her back under the first touch of his fingers
hector laps it up inspired to caress ever more tenderly her scalp and neck still with the outward purpose of looking for fleas
a tiny little one
yours are so small
to hector even her fleas are a delight
he seems to want to keep it as a pet
there is no hope for this man
beatrice moans softly happily
hector still kneading her scalp
i dont know your name
who are you
beatrice replies with a hint of breathlessness
i think youll have to do under my arms
im a little itchy there
yes i think beatrice is a good name
beatrice is sighing contentedly now
maybe we should find the river and have a proper wash
in between parting the hairs on her scalp hector is kiss ing her on the neck now
at first it is small snatched kisses amongst the grooming but soon the kisses become longer and the grooming less
im still itchy lots of places hector
the priest is with some seriously wounded soldiers laid out in a corner of the farmyard
whether he is a bogus priest or not ronald is taking his duties seriously
there is a little of the rogue about him now
he sees the nun and the little girl preparing to leave
they have acquired a mule
they mount up the girl behind the nun and plod off through the farmyard
they stop briefly beside the priest to say their farewells
goodbye little girl
the lord will bless you i know in his house
he talks to the nun as they move off
how long for you on the road
three or four days
good luck to you
theyre not killing nuns yet
the saxon wont he go with you
hes nowhere to be seen
the priest watches them go and then returns to his duties with the wounded
the nuns mule turns out of the farmyard and heads off along the track
a few soldiers are burying some of their dead nearby
the nun watches this and doesnt see what the girl sees on the other side the mingled bodies of hector and beatrice all pretence at grooming now gone engaged in
its probably the first and last that the girl will see
a smile flickers across her face before she turns away forever
ahead of her there might be many a bleak night in her convent when she will remember the image and that same smile will return to her lips
the priest is kneeling beside a young wounded soldier
he is close to death but in his youth is fighting it
he is frightened and clings to the presence of ronald
my name is peter
dont forget tell everybody that was my name
ronald is mumbling his prayers
lie still peter
thats it peter
tell everybody write it
dont forget it
tell them peter died here my name is peter
say it again
ronald stays with the boy as he struggles against his own annihilation
ronald behaves well with the dying boy
the priest makes his way upstairs in the darkness
he yawns a long contented yawn
he has completed the hardest days work that he has undertaken as a priest if he really is a priest
if he is not then the pre tence has been just as exhausting
he wants to sleep
in the room sleeping forms lie here and there in the darkness
some officers have moved in and the place is more crowded than before
the priest makes his way to his corner but on the way he pauses by beatrice
she snores lightly
the priest bends over and takes a long sniff at her then he sighs out his admiration
he steps over her and settles into his own space by the window
he suddenly misses the presence of hector
he looks again at beatrice still and sleeping
what the priest doesnt see is the extra pair of hands massaging her neck and head
she moans softly in her pretence of sleep
the priest is troubled suspicious but he doesnt know why
he sniffs again in the general direction of beatrice
the mingled smells that his sensitive nose detects perplex him but he settles down pulling his cloak over his head
across the room hectors head emerges from the covering beside beatrice
they make love quietly in the dark also enjoying the thrill of confounding the priest
the priest wakes up
outside he can hear the first sounds of the day the murmuring voices of soldiers in the yard the clatter of milk pails
in the room it is still semi dark
the priest sits up
the others have already left but beatrice is there stretching herself and fixing her hair
hector is not with her
she smiles at the priest
then in another part of the room hector emerges from what looks like a pile of clothing sits up and smiles too
hector and beatrice look at each other
the priest looks at them in turn
their cheeky act of innocence mocks him
hector is washing himself by the stream that flows close by the yard
he drinks a handful of water for breakfast
the priest sees him from the farmyard and comes to join him
hector is in a cheerful mood pleased with himself and his success with beatrice
the priest is sullen reproachful
youre a busy man what with all these souls departing
theres nothing wrong with helping someone to die in peace
they want me to go with them
nothing at all
are you staying here
moving on as you told me to
well meet up like you said
ill wait for you at the channel
shell do you harm
i told you
she might be a witch
wait for me
i still have the money from venice
we can be home in a month
witch my arse
stop giving me orders
both of them are unhappy now confusing one another spoiling their friendship
youre a strange fellow
are you a priest
are you jealous
the priest is silent
they are saved from hurting each other more
a soldier shouts down to them from the farm
were moving soon father
the priest turns to hector for what might be the last time
so youre leaving
you have work to do here
the priest walks back up to the farm
hector calls out what might be an attempt at an apology or simply another taunt
i dont understand you
the priest looks back at him briefly then walks on
hector and beatrice have packed their few belongings into a shoulder bag
they turn out of the farmyard and walk down the main track
hector catches a last glimpse of the priest being helped onto the back of a horse behind a soldier
he is ridden off in the opposite direction with the rest of the troop
other battles lie ahead to be blessed and more battered bodies requiring comfort
hector and beatrice are enjoying the first pulse quickening flush of their intimacy and the thrill of knowing it will go further
they chatter freely despite not sharing a language
im glad were going the same way
well have to sleep in the hills tonight
will you keep me warm
the damp greyness of the early morning has lifted and the sun is shining as they step out onto the higher hills
hector and beatrice have stopped to eat
they shelter in the fold of a hillside with a wide stream running some way below
hector feeds beatrice a piece of cheese from his knife
hurry up and finish your wine and then we can make love
hector seems to know what she is saying
he throws down his knife and cheese lying down with her on the grass
he kisses her breasts and her body eagerly
he lifts her skirts and caresses and kisses her naked legs and thighs
she stretches herself out happily arms spread wide on the grass
hector talks through his kisses
why do you smell so wonderful
he lifts his head to let her see him sniffing
oh you like my smell do you
i make it from the flowers
i put it here and there and there
hector kisses her more
she smiles and turns her head to the sky
then she starts to giggle
i dont believe it
someones watching us the dirty devil
hes down by the water by the rocks
hector doesnt understand and keeps on with his kissing
only her persistent giggling makes him stop and look up
hector sees him too
down by the stream a head peering over the top of a rock not even attempting to hide
hes not moving
he mustve seen us though
she sits up and straightens her clothing suddenly anxious
dont look at him anymore
down the other side of the hill
but hector still looks at the figure in the distance
there is an uneasy silence while hector works it out
then he speaks
its a dead man
beatrice doesnt understand
hector stands up still looking at the figure
come on were going that way at any rate
they move cautiously
when they are closer to it and can see it for what is is they walk straight for the dead body
it is the body of a young squire handsomely dressed in the livery of his master
such a squire would follow his knight into battle guiding him through the chaos
but this boy seems to have died a less public more furtive death
he lies leaning against a rock eyes open an expression something like a smile on his face
there is no sign of a wound
hector looks around at the ground
no sign of a battle
only a few horses
or just one
he wasnt killed in a fight
isnt he fine looking
look at his shoes
there is a sadness about this young death in such a lonely place
hector and beatrice are open to this sad ness but in their age sentiment was of a tougher strain
well cover his eyes at least
so the crows dont get him
look at these shoes though
she is already gathering stones
hector sees what beatrice is doing
thats good of you
as he lays him down hector sees a small dry wound on the boys side
beatrice brings her armful of stones and starts to build a mound around the squires head
hector helps her by gathering stones from the stream
soon they have covered his head completely with stones his body lying exposed
its all we can do
it wont keep the wolves away though
beatrice is still taken by the boys shoes
his feet are like mine you know
ill give you mine poor boy and ill have yours
i have more walking to do
she looks at hector
its not stealing if i give him mine is it
hector watches as beatrice exchanges her old shoes for the squires
they fit her well and she proudly shows them off to hector
he smiles at her
later hector and beatrice are enjoying each other immensely making love by the stream
beatrice hasnt removed her new shoes she likes them so much
she is dabbing hector with her perfume which he has discovered she keeps in a small bottle kept in a pouch on a chain around her neck
nearby the corpse of the squire still lies its head shrouded in stones as if absurdly hiding its eyes from the antics of hector and beatrice
the old shoes beatrice has placed on its feet look odd compared to the fine uniform
hector and beatrice seem unaware of the strangeness of their situation but perhaps it only looks strange to our modern eyes
hector continues to bask in her wonderful aroma
youve put magic in this stuff havent you youre bewitching me
they appear to get the gist of one anothers love talk
youre eager today hector arent you
is it all this death
i dont know what youre saying but i like you when you talk
hector is watching beatrice conduct some kind of ceremony over the corpse of the squire
she takes a handful of dried flowers or herbs from a pouch in her bag
mumbling strangely and quickly to herself she walks around the corpse three times scattering the leaves over the body
hector is fascinated but a little uneasy
he watches from a safe distance
during the few moments that it takes beatrice seems like a different person
then all of a sudden the familiar friendly beatrice returns
she completes her ceremony by throwing a few drops of her perfume over the body
that should help him a little
we should go now
weve been here too long
i wonder if his mama will ever know what happened
you said mama
i know what that is
we can talk the same
they have reached the summit of the hills
it is like the roof of the world
below them lies the valley
the air is clean
the landscape looks untouched by man but a few smudges of smoke in the distance suggest farms or villages
there might be the glimpse of a castle on a hill
if it all feels oddly familiar to us then perhaps it is the memory of a picture in a forgotten story book or an ancient landscape on a gallery wall
once again in the film there is the tantalizing feeling of awaking not from a dream but in a dream
the moment passes in the more down to earth concerns of hector and beatrice
i have to keep the sun on my back thats what ronald said
the sun on my back all the way home
ill stay on this side of the river
yes of course
we stay on this side of the river all the way down
i stay on this side
on this side
then the other
they move off each thinking that they have reached agreement
beatrice starts to sing as they make a gentle descent into the forests below
beatrice is milking a stray cow they have found in the forest
hector is watching her especially her hands
she manipulates the udders of the cow deftly sexily
her hands seem to have sensual personalities all of their own
she is chattering non stop explaining the subtleties of milking to hector
but he cant take his eyes or his mind off her thrilling hands
he responds distractedly
hector lies by their small fire watching beatrice who sleeps by his side
she is dreaming
she mumbles in her sleep whole sentences
she turns this way and that
hector watches in fascination
we feel the echo of another night when a man watched someone sleep and dream
he handles some of the things spilling from her bag lying beside him
her dried flowers and herbs which he sniffs her little bottles and phials
or simply an early version of a cluttered handbag
we dont know what is passing through hectors mind
perhaps he is trying to work out how he came to be lying with the strange wonderful unknowable creature by his side
and how many people have done that through the ages in caves or by campfires or in suburban bedrooms
there are many ways in which we will be able to connect with this perplexed flea ridden man far away from home huddling by a fire in the forest trapped
in his time as we all are
hector and beatrice are on the move again
they make their way down into the thickening forest
beatrice walks ahead light footed and humming to herself
she seems to be in comfortably familiar territory now
the mist swirls about him as hector follows on behind tagging along as if caught in her sexual wake
hector and beatrice have reached the river broad and slow moving
beatrice has hailed a boatman from the far side
he maneuvers his small boat to them and they clamber aboard
beatrice and the boatman greet each other familiarly
they gossip amiably as the ferry makes its way across the river
hector sits quietly with a smile on his face their chatter incomprehensible to him
as they climb out of the ferry hector is suddenly unsure of what he is doing
i think were going the wrong way
i want the sun on my back
we should have stayed on the other side
he mimes what he means
were nearly there
ill fix your back for you
give you a good rub
before he can protest she has moved off
so he follows her
they have reached the outskirts of a village
beatrice turns off the main track and up a narrow path
hector follows her
soon she stops at a small house close to an orchard
the house sits in the mess of a run down farm yard chickens and goats running here and there
beatrice opens the door of the house and goes inside
hector hesitates before following her
beatrice turns to him when they are inside
here we are
you want some food
and then ill show you everything
we have a spring you can wash
hector stands looking around the small dark room
beatrice suddenly seems shy and awkward
this is when i wish you could understand me
youll have to learn you know
i want you to stay here
you want to dont you
hector looks at her in silence
i look after the hens and i make dyes from the plants and perfumes too
im good at that
but im no good with the sheep and the goats
i wish you could understand
arnauds been dead two years
she crosses the room to a wooden chest under the window
she lifts the lid and removes some mens clothing rough working trousers and a hide jacket
i still have his clothes
ill make them fit you
she holds the jacket up against hector to measure it
hectors reaction to a dead mans clothing is predictable
what did he die of
im getting shy
imagine me being shy with you
i made this for him
tonight well try them on
youre the same height as arnaud but a little thinner
ill make them fit
im a good sewer
and we have a big bed upstairs for you and me in the rafters
you and me
hector is beginning to understand what she means but he keeps his feelings to himself
beatrice talks on
now that she has started she wants to say it all
i like you
you like me too dont you
we were lucky to meet the way we did
all the men around here are old
beatrice falls silent overtaken by her shyness
hector understands fully what she means now but his mind is a confusion
he cant respond
she tries to direct his thoughts to the one area she is sure about
come up and ill show you the bed
she climbs a ladder nearby and lifts open a trapdoor on the wooden ceiling
hector climbs up to join her and together they stand on the ladder with their heads poking into the tiny space above
beatrice is proud of her bed a rough mattress on the floor covered in some blankets she has probably made herself
the bed takes up most of the space of the small attic
they look at it together
a good bed eh
for you and me
we can have fun up here
better than a ditch
hectors expression lightens a little too
it occurs to him to take up her offer immediately
she catches his thought and the moment tingles happily
then from outside they hear voices
firstly a young boy calling
mama are you home
beatrice and hector descend back in the room
a boy of about eight and a girl of ten are coming in from the garden
they have been working outside
beatrice goes to embrace each of them
hectors face is a confusion once again
you were gone a long time
the girl eyes hector up and down
this is hector
beatrice pronounces his name with care
she stands proudly by her children
these are my children
the creak of a door makes hector turn his head
and this is my mother
an old woman stands in the main doorway smiling at hector and nodding her head
she speaks to her daughter
you found one eh
hector stands surrounded by instant family and doesnt know what to do
eventually he speaks
is there water
he mimes with his hands
beatrice understands that he wants some breathing space
she talks to her son
take hector to the well
but come here first
she takes off the dead squires shoes and puts them on the boys bare feet
he is delighted
he does a little dance in them before leaving with hector
hector stands at the well some way from the house
beatrices garden is a madness of wild flowers harvested by her for scents and powders
she is a remarkable woman living as she does in the harsh male world of her time
the scented air and the dizzy sounds of the bees almost make hector swoon
he is experiencing the full heady impact of beatrice and it is summed up in a full blown pollen filled sneeze
he drinks at her well
the boy is beside him still engrossed in his new shoes
hector splashes some water on his face and looks back at the house
he has some decisions to make
the mother sits by the window in the nearest thing to a comfortable chair that the house has to offer
she is working on some lace
hector enters the room to watch her
he smiles and stands shyly at the door
the mother thinks he wants her chair for himself
in a flurry of apology she rises drops her work and motions for hector to have the good seat
he is full of embarrassment
i just came to watch
he guides the mother back to the good chair
they struggle comically for a while but eventually she allows hector to settle her there
she mumbles unhappily
we cant have this
this was arnauds seat
its yours now
i can sit on the box
hector gently pacifies her
you must sit there
you need the light from the window
its your seat
i dont want it
i can sit on the box
the old woman allows herself a shy smile
whether in innocence or mischief she has secured the best seat in the house for herself
if he stays hector will never dare rest his bones in it
hector has retreated to the yard
the girl is boiling some dyes in a cauldron over an open fire
the boy is working at a basketful of flower heads pulling petals and separating the hearts putting them in a large jar of colored liquid
hector is aware of beatrice watching him
she is returning to the kitchen firmly holding a struggling chicken wings flapping and feathers flying everywhere
this chicken is making the supreme sacrifice in beatrices final effort at total seduction a wonderful meal
hector is guiltily aware of this as their eyes meet briefly
hector takes in what the boy is doing and joins in the work
the boy smiles at hectors initial clumsiness
he motions for hector to have a sniff of the jar of liquid
hector does so
the smell is heady and pleasant
the boy says something and points towards his sister
she stands by her cauldron stirring the bubbling liquid
hector goes to watch her work
he looks in the cauldron
without thinking hector leans over the cauldron to sniff
a hideous odor assaults him
he backs off
the girl says something to him and points to a bucket of liquid at her feet
hector makes out something like the word peepee
the girl nods enthusiastically
the boy is sniggering
hector sits at the table with beatrice and her family
there is an air of awkward silence although the boy and girl look openly at hector perhaps assessing him as a future father
the meal has been served in a communal pot
in beatrices house there is the luxury of small individual plates
the others wait for hector to begin but he indicates to the old mother to help herself first
she does and she doesnt stop until her plate is heaped high with food
there is definitely some power play going on in the old womans mind although her face is all innocence
hector submits taking only a modest portion of food
the old mothers appetite is prodigious
it is comical to watch her little frame consume so much quietly and methodically
she is an eating machine
during the meal beatrice and hector exchange glances
but this time their talking without words is a serious affair
from the kitchen beatrice watches hector in the garden
he is making an effort to appear relaxed but as he paces here and there beatrice knows that he is unhappy
she leaves the kitchen to join him
take a walk to the village if you want
you look as if you need a walk
hector opens his heart to her knowing she will understand his feelings if not his words
i have to leave soon
i cant stay
it would be wrong to stay for just a while
it is awkward for hector to say goodbye
i have to go
have to keep the sun on my back
i have to get home
i have a family just like you
i like you
you smell good
hector fumbles awkwardly with his bag and then walks off down the track
he turns to look at beatrice
she stands outside her house for a long time watching him until he turns onto the main road and out of sight
the pain and the awkwardness in beatrice and hector are specific but the scene of parting is timeless
is this the ten millionth such parting or the billionth
it is one of them at any rate and a sad one
hector has reached the river but it is already growing dark and the boatman has gone for the night
hector sees the boat dragged out of the water
he sits down against the trunk of a large tree
his eyes begin to close
he looks around him
he is on a huge raft made of ships timbers
we have left our previous hector sitting under his tree years ago
this hector is awakening into what might be a nightmare
the huge raft is many smaller rafts lashed together
there are over a hundred and fifty people perched on them lying or squatting in sleep
it is early morning
the sea is calm around them but the deep ocean swell is still there to remind them of their predicament menacing like a controlled anger
hector is fully awake now sitting against some boxes
he speaks to andre sitting close by
andre is hectors slave still bound to him in service through shipwreck and disaster
our hector is now a master
andre is a young asian
a quiet capable intelligent man but with that same lost look in his eyes that hector had as a slave
he too is far from home
i had a wonderful dream
i was lying under a tree beside a river
i was dozing
i heard the water
beautiful clear water
i got up and drank some
i think i ate some raspberries too
i would like some water
hector looks around him at the squalid mass of distressed humanity
god this is the worst the worst
some figures rise and an argument takes place like a domestic squabble
we can hear some of their exchanges
let me keep him
they said well find land in a day or so
when theyre dead they go over the side
the place stinks enough as it is
there is a flurry of movement amongst the figures then a splash then a cry of a woman
the noise has awakened others
all over the raft figures are coming awake sitting up taking in the new day and the dreadful reality of their situation
andre speaks to hector
do you think ill still see europe
i think theres more chance of me eating you andre
the more we see of the people their costumes weapons mannerisms the easier we will place them in their time
they are survivors of a foundered ship some time at the height of the great colonial empires
the year could be
the place is the indian ocean
hector turns his eyes to another part of the raft closer to him
he watches a man and woman
the woman ursula still has her eyes closed sleeping on a pile of canvas
the man francisco stands beside her holding a cloak over her to protect her from sea spray
his eye catches hectors and they hold each others gaze for a long time
there is antipathy but also pain in their look
a man dom paulo moves among the waking wretches
he speaks with authority
i think today will be the day my friends
weve been in the inshore currents since yesterday
three crowns to the first one to sight the coast
god preserve us all
someone speaks from under a crude canvas shelter
never mind the three crowns
a side of beef would do
or a drink of clean water
dom paulo strides off to his station by the makeshift rudder
dont worry therell be food for all ashore
africas full of meat and drink
its full of africans too
the sun is up and dom paulo was right
the raft is now standing off shore riding out the heavy ocean surf before finally beaching
the strong are helping to row ashore under the shouted instructions of the navigator
those too weak to help are huddled beside their posses sions hoping to survive this final trial of the sea
hector works his oar with the rest
he has time to cast a glance at ursula and francisco
francisco in his manic heroic way manages to row while at the same time trying to offer a steadying arm to ursula
if hector had time or energy to laugh he would
the raft is in the full rage of the surf
the sense behind its loose construction is obvious now
snake like it rides the waves one half up the other down
the beaching isnt easy
a few people are washed overboard with no way of saving them
finally the raft makes it through the barrier of the outer surf
they are in a long curving bay
up from the beach lies an area of dunes and beyond that a thick belt of jungle
the raft scrapes onto the sand
those near the beach scramble ashore immediately prostrating themselves in prayers of thanks while those at the back jump into the water and clumsily wade the last few feet to
hectors attention is never far from ursula
she is struggling in the water with some of her baggage
a youth nuno goes to help her
hector overtakes him and nudges him out of the way offering to take ursulas load from her shoulders
she refuses his help
waist deep in water they tussle over her bundle of possessions
hector overpowers her wrestles her load from her grasp angrily wades to the shore and dumps it on the sand
in amongst the drama of their situation their little battle of wills seems petty and pathetic but it reveals much about their past
soon the survivors are dragging their possessions from the raft
they have managed to hoard a surprising amount from their doomed ship
carpets chests chairs all are dragged ashore
civilization has taken hold quickly in this little corner of africa
dom paulo the leader already has a table and chair set up in the sand and behind him sailors are erectig a tent like house made from timbers and rich
tapestries and carpets
the others are making their own shelters all along the beach
a regular little community is taking shape a crazy rich textured village decked out in all the colors of the east
the silks and ginghams that were destined for the finest halls in europe now give shelter to sick slaves starving sailors ruined traders and grieving mothers
some of the survivors have recovered sufficiently from the trauma of near death to mark out the boundaries of their new beach homes with lines of stones
the habits of ownership die hardest of all
although dom paulo is the man in authority he is also a man in deep shock
most of what he has earned or plundered in his colonial years now lies at the bottom of the ocean
since he is socially superior to anyone else on the ship he assumes responsibility and command
there are probably fifty men among the survivors more suited to lead them to safety
by dom paulos side always is his son
a quiet boy of about eleven
he is like a little miniature of his father dressed in the same style of clothes
he is a constant silent witness to everything that dom paulo does good or bad wise or foolish
he and his father are a continuing fascination for hector and we can enjoy hector watching the boy watching his father
some of the absurdities and comedies of the situation can be high lighted in this way
there can be sadness in it too however the pain of a son witnessing his fathers compromises or failures all too closely and dom paulos sad awareness of his image
slowly tarnishing in his sons eyes
amidst the construction work dom paulo is talking with some of his officers
how many made it
eighteen children and forty five slaves
two parties of ten men each
one to the north and one to the south
bring back what you can
game fruit anything
and send someone back as soon as you find fresh water
any trouble discharge three shots
the officer leaves to carry out his orders
dom paulo addresses another of his men da cunha
have the carpenter start immediately on a cross a big one
father diogo wants a place of worship by this time tomorrow
well look for a spot later
weve all got a lot of praying to do
and wheres dias
tell him i want to see him
hector and andre are walking through the half built village
andre is carrying hectors possessions a rolled up carpet and a bolt of colorful cloth
we feel an echo of the days when hector was a slave walking two paces behind with his masters possessions
hector finds what he is looking for
francisco is working on a shelter for himself and ursula with the help of some slaves
hector approaches him making another attempt to heal wounds from his past
i have a carpet and some cloth
i thought if we worked together we could make a better shelter
francisco barely stops his work to reply
if its a joke its a poor one
at least ask dona ursula
i dont have to ask her
i know she would agree with me
leave us alone
his stubborn rejection of hector reveals just how strong their friendship once was
would you take my cloth at least
keep it and build your own hovel somewhere else
leave us alone
then from along the beach the sound of raised voices distracts them
they see some figures laden with supplies running off into the forest
others are following them discharging muskets shouting for the deserters to stop
hector and francisco walk briskly in the direction of the trouble
they see two of the deserters being overtaken by their pursuers
the rest make their escape into the jungle
hector and francisco reach dom paulos office in the sand
the leading citizens are gathering there as the two captured deserters are brought in
they ran off with the dry bread
about eight of them sir
dom paulo looks at the two prisoners
you men are deserters
you will die tomorrow
he speaks again to the sailor
chain them on the raft for tonight and watch them
francisco steps forward outraged
i must object
these sentences cant be lawful
dom paulos authoritative manner vanishes in an instant
he becomes hesitant unsure of himself
as always his son watches every detail of the exchange
do you think so
we cant allow ourselves to fall into terror and violence
but then how can we punish them
we cant lock them up
dom paulo looks around at the assembled notables confused out of his depth
other opinions are voiced
you were right the first time sir
they must hang
they were stealing the bread from our mouths
the captured deserters look on helplessly as their lives are argued over
i didnt steal any bread
gomes had the bread
hes off in the forest
dom paulo turns to the priest
what do you think father
the priest throws open his arms noncommittally
ill comfort them whether they live or die now or later any of you all of you
ill comfort you all
you have to set an example
dom paulo is deeply confused
so i was right the first time
francisco confuses him even more
there must be proper justice
whats proper justice
i didnt steal any bread
you have to make a decision sir
it was gomes
he told us to run
no i wont
well all decide
most of the people that matter are here
well have a vote
who agrees with salgado
that they should die
a lot of hands go up
hector hesitates his instincts are not for killing
but the force of the majority weighs on him
he starts to raise his hand
at that moment as he scans the crowd he meets the eyes of the deserter whose death they are voting on
for a moment they communicate
hector is thrown
he drops his hand only to find in the next instant the stern gaze of salgado on him
he hesitates again then starts to raise his hand
then the eyes of the deserter find him once more
this comic pantomime goes on while a solid majority of the crowd firmly raise their hands
and those against death
one of the deserters raises his own hand meekly
you cant vote
then he looks to salgado
it doesnt matter
then the other deserter raises his hand too
i dont think this is working dom paulo
we need authority
you must decide
dom paulo thinks
da cunha steps forward
the cross the carpenter is working on
tell him to turn it into a scaffold
have it erected along the beach away from the women
the executions will be at sunrise tomorrow
tell father diogo
he turns to the sailors holding the deserters
take them to the raft
the dazed deserters are led off
dom paulos face clouds in doubt again
everyone in agreement with hanging
or should we shoot them
hanging is fine sir
whos going to conduct the executions
should we pick someone or have a volunteer
dom paulo looks over the faces of the men
he stops at hector
hector doesnt have the will to accept or the courage to refuse
he is saved by another young man alvarez eager to prove himself
ill do it dom paulo
thank you alvarez
send the priest to them tonight
we can sense the feeling of relief in hector
dom paulos son has been a silent witness to everything that has happened but his blank face reveals nothing of his feelings
it is growing dark
fires are being lit outside the shelters
andre is building hectors tent while hector watches him
the tent is only large enough for one person and somehow looks mean compared with the others
good work andre
he looks across to the well made shelter of ursula and francisco
ursula herself works at the fire
hector turns to andre
you go and sleep by the big fire andre
hector goes inside his little house
he puts his back to the entrance and opens the canvas sack which contains all his possessions
he pulls out his prize a sizeable chunk of bread and some dried fruit
he guiltily gnaws at the hard bread
he is surprised by the sound of the boy nuno outside
hector quickly stows his food back into his sack and with a grunt of irritation sticks his head out of the shelter
nuno is holding four fruits about the size of large apples but green and thick skinned
this was all they found in the forest
four for each of us
they taste kind of milky but sour
thank you nuno
my mother ate three and she was sick
so try two
but shes sick anyway
maybe you can try three
ill start with two
nuno makes to leave but then hesitates
hector will you help me
nuno is looking down the beach to the remains of the raft on the shoreline
the shapes of the two deserters chained there can just be seen
the boy theyre going to hang tomorrow
he was cooks cabin boy
i was going to take him something to eat
i thought perhaps one of yours and one of mine
he looks at the fruit he has just given hector
you said you might just eat two
but theres tomorrow nuno
we must eat tomorrow too
nuno looks disappointed
his eyes turn again to his playmate tied to the raft
dom paulo would call it a waste
you must keep yourself strong nuno thats what hed say
so that you can help the others
god knows what we have ahead of us
well need strong people like you
nuno is silent unconvinced
try not to think about lopo any more
the guards wouldnt let you near him anyway
nuno stomps away in silence
hector shouts after him cheerily
in the privacy of their tent dom paulo and his son are engaged in their nightly ritual practicing on their recorders
dom paulo leads the young boy through an intricate pretty tune
they sit formally and there is an air of stoicism about them determined as they are to maintain their civilized habits in these bleakest of circumstances
but there is also a feeling of madness about it
the madness of a man who has lost a grip of what is going on about him
down on the beach men are waiting to die in the morning on his orders
the blend of formality and madness make the scene comic
the sun has risen sharply soaring out of the ocean
it blinds the eyes of those in the little execution party making their way along the beach
the cross cum scaffold has been erected some way from the camp
most people are attending to their morning chores with one eye on the grim act of justice being carried out along the shore
our view of the hangings will be from the distance of the camp marionette figures men dancing on ropes the form ality of legal death
the priest and the executioners
it takes a while for the people in the camp to become aware of the other observers up on the dunes
three figures stand in full view boldly silently watching the camp and the pantomime at the scaffold
the word passes around the camp
eyes pass between the executions and the tall natives watching
the first man is already dangling on the rope by the time that dom paulo and his officers are discussing the appearance of the natives
some gunpowder would scatter them sir
no they might want to be friendly
theyll have food too
get one of our african slaves
we must try and talk to them
if they think were timid were dead
a solitary slave makes his way up from the camp to the natives on the dunes
everyone in the camp watches as he approaches them
there is tension
will the natives run or fight or talk
they begin to talk
the natives seem most interested in the hangings and point in that direction asking questions
the slave makes an attempt at explaining what is happening but the natives seem baffled
they start laughing and shaking their heads
by now the second figure is dangling on the rope the cross making an efficient double gallows
while franciscos attention has been on the natives hector has sidled up to him still hoping to ingratiate himself
he talks while they watch the two events the hanging and the meeting
i hate it when people have to die
killing our own men when we have the whole of africa to face
its foolish squabbling at all
we should be friends
francisco looks at him for the meaning in what he is saying
he takes a small bundle from his jacket and gives it to francisco
some bread and raisins
i thought everything was shared out on the raft
well this wasnt
its for her
francisco looks hector straight in the eye looking for his angle
but this time there is none
hector is simply a lonely man seeking to retrieve lost friendship
there is a glimmer of sympathy in franciscos face
on the high dunes the slave and the natives have now parted company
the deserters still spin at the end of their ropes the priest praying at their feet
francisco walks away from him
hector calls out
i must speak to her
the slave approaches dom paulo outside his tent
they want to make a visit here
with their king
he will bring gifts and will receive gifts
they said not to sacrifice anymore men for them
they dont like that
dom paulo and the others laugh
the tide is sweeping more wreckage into the bay
barrels and boxes and timber bob in the waves
people make their way to the shoreline to retrieve these new gifts from the sea
the whole of the camp is eager and shouting
they bring in the boxes and barrels
a whole harmonium is man handled ashore
some boys drag it up onto dry sand and start to work its bellows
at first only water spurts from it but then a watery note or two is emitted
the mood soon becomes festive
dom paulo makes his way down to the shore to make the celebrations official
by now the first of the newly arrived crates are being opened
inside are eggs many many large eggs in crate after crate
an officer brings the first of the eggs to dom paulo
turtles eggs sir
doctor correa was shipping them to the royal zoo
i think they hoped some of them would hatch
its eggs for supper tonight
that night everyone does eat turtles eggs
at their fires in the dusk they fry them boil them scramble them
some eat them raw
the abundant green fruits make a tolerable side dish
the happy mood of the afternoon has survived into the night
for once there is enough to eat and the hangings are a thing of the past
above the roar of the constantly rolling surf the croaky sounds of the waterlogged harmonium can be heard
sadly for hector the harmonium enthusiast is very close to his shelter
the jangly music is loud and insistent
hector removes six large eggs from a bag and takes them outside to his fire
andre is there eating the last of his omelette
how are they
hector cracks one of his eggs into a copper pan
inside is a brown smudge of dried yoke and some dust
hector grunts in annoyance and cracks another egg
the yoke is discolored and the smell is rank
hector looks at andre rapidly finishing his omelette before hector can demand it
yours were fine
hector picks up a third egg and shakes itclose to his ear
it seems as empty as the other two
he picks up a fourth egg and cracks it open
a small dried up half formed baby turtle rattles into the pan
andre is quietly enjoying hectors frustration
he stands up to leave
have you any eggs left
the slaves only got three
i want to ask you something
you were lucky
i want my real name back
you dont like andre anymore
i think of my home all the time
i want to hear the name they call me
we should die with our real names
were not going to die andre
hector smiles at his own insensitivity
ive forgotten your name
now i remember why we called you andre
andre looks at him expectantly
i will andre
ill call you that
when i remember
andre is satisfied and leaves
hector calls to him
hector is alone
hector gives up on the eggs and pulls out his store of bread and fruit from the tent
the next source of annoyance is the continuing noise of the he shouts across to the musical enthusiast a youth with a few older children by his side
stop that will you
think of the older people and the sick
ill give you an egg if you stop
the officers and dom paulo are selecting items for barter from their crates and boxes of valuables
hector and other notables are also there
cheap goods a box of rosaries and crucifixes made of common beads for example are being gone through and suitable junk selected for gifts
they talk as they work
how many are sick
about fifty sir some of them very sick indeed
its the eggs
a couple of the crates were full of rotten ones but eaten just the same
others just ate too many
it would have been better to ration them i suppose
how wise of you to think of that now
how many eggs did you have
i had them boiled
i had four
i dont feel well now
fours all right
the really ill ones had eaten eight ten
lets not think about it
what have you got
salgado comes forward with a handful of the broken remains of a kettle
copper is a useful currency
it worked well
theyll go for this
luis cleaned up a sackful from the crates
salgado shows a handful of nails from a small sack in his hand
organize some men to gather all the nails they can find
we have to keep control of that particular currency
dom paulo rummages in a box of cheap rosaries selects a couple and then retires to his tent
the others work on at the table
hector drifts off down to the beach
inside his tent dom paulo goes to his small mirror
he takes off the heavy silver chain and medallion from around his neck and a valuable brooch from his coat
he stows them safely in a locked box and replaces it in its hiding place in the sand floor
then he adorns himself in the cheap rosary and other trashy items
dom paulo catching sight of his watching son in the mirror holds a silencing finger to his mouth
hector is walking along the beach close to a pile of discarded boxes and crates
he quickly searches through them
he soon finds what he is looking for a piece of wood with some nails still attached to it
he pulls out the nails and pockets them then continues to rummage amongst the wood for more
hector is a survivor
and not the first hector to scavenge on a beach in a world that feels big and empty
hector is enjoying the freshness of the day
we see him climb over a dune and then as he nears the summit duck and retreat down the slope again
cautiously he crawls up the dune and looks over to the other side
he is watching a young girl and the boy nuno
they are twelve or thirteen years old
they are coyly in the early stages of making love the boy lying close to the girl kissing her beginning to caress her
their love making is poised oddly between childs play and eroticism
its their day of discovery and it is like a dream of love
the boy is just about to discover some more and is fumbling with the girls clothing when he looks up and catches sight of hector
hector ducks down but knows he has been seen and decides to brazen it out
he stands up in full view of them
leave her alone
get back to the camp
or ill tell your mother
how can you play like this when there are people needing your help back there
the boy is standing now and fixing his clothing
he walks off back to the camp
the girl remains sitting in the sand buttoning her dress too embarrassed even to raise her head to hector
then hector is touched by something perhaps the sad stoop in the boys shoulder or the girls lowered head
hector realizes he has broken something precious and in their circumstances infinitely fragile and irretrievable
he feels like an oaf
he calls after the boy
i didnt mean it
it was a joke
you come back
shes still here
i wont say anything
but the boy walks on turning around now and then to look at hector who feels foolish and mean
hector calls down to the girl
but she doesnt look up still fumbling with her buttons
hector curses quietly and looks out across the dunes angry with himself
then he sees the procession of the native king and his people some cattle and porters carrying baskets
hector runs off towards the camp
the meeting of the two leaders is weird and wonderful to see
the ragged europeans already scanning the baskets of the natives for signs of solid food somehow still muster an absurd sense of their own importance for the occasion
the natives excited and curious trying to contain their exuberance so that they dont miss a single detail of this most significant day
many of the natives have climbed into the trees either out of timidity or to get a better view the trees around the meeting place are dripping with bodies like
hector slips into the crowd as the native king is in mid speech
when he has stopped talking the slave begins to haltingly translate
he was excited when he heard you had come but he wants to know if you are real people
he didnt think you would be such a strange color
so he wants to see your
he points repeatedly at his navel
so that he will know that you were born like real people
dom paulo wont suffer the indignity alone
he talks to the officers standing closest to him
you four as well
he begins to open up his coat and shirt
the four officers do the same
the king and a few of his atten dants take a step or two forward and peer at the exposed white european bellies
they look at one another and mumble solemnly
then they step back
dom paulo and the officers fix their clothing and re muster their dignity
the king is enjoying himself
he speaks again to the slave who then translates
he wants to see you breathe
the king takes a deep breath then nods to dom paulo
dom paulo and the officers do as they are told
the king joins them and for a few moments there is a kind of communion between them
then everyone joins in
it is a strange poignant moment all the natives and all the europeans united in the simple act of breathing
dom paulo regains his composure
he speaks to the slave
tell him that we want to trade with him to buy food
and we want him to guide us out of here
we have a long way to travel
to where the white men have their big ships
the slave speaks to the king
the king listens and talks back for a long time
then the slave translates again
he has heard of white men very very far away
but you have to cross many rivers
twenty big rivers
tell him i want to give him these
dom paulo steps forward to the king
an officer brings a wrapped cloth
dom paulo opens it letting the king see the pieces of broken copper inside
the officer produces a handful of large nails and gives them directly to the king
the king nods his head in approval and shows the nails to his attendants
they are impressed
and tell him that i want to make him a very special gift as one king to another
various officers raise their eyebrows at this
of these precious things which my fathers and forefathers have worn for many long years before
dom paulo solemnly and without a blush removes the cheap rosary from around his neck and offers it to the king
i shouldnt do this but it is such a special occasion and he is such a great and worthy king
this is translated
the king refuses to accept the rosary
instead he is pointing to a couple of chunky and valuable looking rings on dom paulos fingers which he has forgotten to remove
he says he could not accept such a treasured gift something of such value to your family
instead he would be happy to take one or two of the old rings you have on your fingers
but please do not insist that he take your necklace
it is impossible to know if the king is being naively polite or hugely clever
dom paulos officers enjoy a muted titter as he peels off his precious rings and gives them to the king replacing the worthless baubles around his own neck
the king begins talking again
the slave translates
he will give you guides to help you across the first of the big rivers
it is ten days from here
thank you thank you
the slave continues
and he asks you to be ready to leave the beach in two days time
he cannot permit you to stay longer
dom paulo looks shocked
because with the new moon the turtles will arrive and lay their eggs
you may frighten them
you must be gone
the mention of turtles eggs almost turns the stomachs of most of the survivors even the fit ones
the king and his followers walk back into the forest
soon the survivors are alone again with the lost looking cow the natives have left
a doomed cow if ever there was
the remains of the cow hang on the spit over the large fire the survivors have made on the beach
small groups of people sit around it gnawing on the roasted flesh
the image is once again timeless the elements of it simple man fire flesh food
one cow doesnt go far between a hundred starving people
some are still on their feet by the large fire
now and then a hand will dart out over the flames to snatch a bone hanging loose or a tasty looking piece of gristle
they are the survivors of the pack if any will be
hector is of course among them
he risks the searing heat to pull at a couple of blackened bones
he sees nuno the boy he chased away from the girl earlier in the day
nuno is sitting by himself staring vacantly at the fire licking his fingers
hector sits down in the sand beside him
nuno hardly notices him until hector offers him one of his bones
nuno grabs it
suck out the marrow
its the best bit
nuno follows hectors example
hector allows him to feel the benefit of his gift before he starts to talk
im sorry about today
it doesnt matter
but it does
it was mean of me
i was upset at something
i wasnt really angry at you
nuno is taking it rather well
hector regains his natural self confidence
you dont think too badly of me
you still like me
nuno shyly nods his head
hector is satisfied now
well that makes me feel better
we all have to like each other
and respect each other
thats important too
they are silent for a moment
if you dont respect me just say so
nuno looks at him smiling weakly
then he turns away in silence
hector tries another approach to win the boy over
i have a boy like you
maybe you could meet him when we get home
this doesnt produce much of a response
hector tries again
he starts to chuckle to himself and nudges nuno in the ribs
you can take her back there tomorrow eh
nuno shakes his head
shes sick now
dom paulo and the priest and some of the officers are having a more formal meal at dom paulos table outside his shelter
an argument is in progress between dom paulo and gaspar dias the navigator
gasper dias has drawn a rough map which lies on the table
cant you be more accurate
hector comes to the meeting
he sits down on a box near the table and watches and listens his expression changing with the shifts in mood of the others
this is hector the social animal our hector with his pockets full of stolen nails and his tent full of stashes of food
how can i be accurate without instruments
as it is im sighting the sun with two pieces of wood
call it five hundred and be done with it
he said twenty rivers
we just want you to be as accurate as we know you can be dias
after all the ship did manage to find that rock with admirable precision
confound you dom paulo thats an insult
she hit that rock because she was taking water and unsteerable
she was overloaded before she left india and you know it
dias pounds his fist on the table
ive told you
we vote for a leader or you can walk into the jungle on your own
it should have been done days ago
calm down dias
you cant stay here forever living on turtles eggs
there are mock groans and laughter at the thought of it
the tension for the moment is broken
what about the sick and the injured dom paulo
dom paulo lets out a heavy sigh
ive discussed it with father diogo
i dont see how a hundred of us can carry seventy sick
im going to search the scriptures tonight
im sure that god has an answer to it
an excuse you mean
well be leaving them here to die
oh so youre coming with us now dias
dias mumbles to himself
after the vote
it might be the best we can offer them now
the chance to die a good christian death here and set an example to the heathens
hector is making his way in the dark back to his shelter
he passes close to the tent of francisco and ursula
francisco is outside by the fire
an impulse takes hector to join him
ill be glad when were on the move
the sound of the sea is driving me mad
good night hector
where is ursula
she hasnt been able to rise since yesterday
hectors face expresses his shock
from what he has heard at the meeting this is serious news
he makes a decision
he speaks to francisco willing their old friendship back into existence in the urgency of the moment
will you share a bottle of wine with me
ive had it since we left the ship
i want to drink it tonight with you
this offer has found a chink in franciscos armor
you have a bottle of wine
well fetch it
hector has returned with his precious bottle
francisco by some miracle has two fine crystal glasses
as they drink they begin to reveal a hint of their old intimacy
you should hang for this
some people on the raft might have lived with a glass of this in their stomach
francisco sips the wine with the relish of long abstinence
i feel very guilty
i brought this too
hector pulls a cotton bag from under his coat
the last i have
francisco cant believe such food still exits
he smiles in anticipation
give it here
francisco grabs at the bag and stuffs two or three sweets into his mouth not so much the gentleman now
i brought it for ursula
francisco talks through his munching
much too rich for her
do you want to kill her
some fruit couldnt
dont argue with me old friend
youre the guilty one around here and dont you forget it
why is it always me
why am i always guilty always sorry
am i so bad
with ursula you werent bad you were stupid
you did the one thing you cant do to a strong woman
you took away her pride
what else can she do but hate you
hector is silent
and then you get on the same ship
what a fool
i had to get home
just like you
and when the ship went down
why did you have to get on the same raft
it was as if you were trying to torment her
the other raft was sinking
franciscos face breaks into a smile
they drink the rest of the bottle in silence the complexity of their friendship having gone beyond words
on a headland overlooking the bay father diogos mass is in progress
every fit member of the camp is there and a good many of the sick have been carried in litters to take part
the harmonium has been carried up the hill and is in full voice some youths dissipating their precious energy on its bellows
the younger boys have been organized into a choir
the large cross stands behind father diogo held in place by a cairn of piled stones at its base
when we find hector there is something tantalizingly familiar about it all the cliffs the ocean the kneeling hector a pile of stones the offering to a god
the natives have gathered nearby
they have been moved perhaps by the music or perhaps by the simple universal posture of worship itself
they begin to sing a low rhythmic compelling chant
it mingles with the distant voice of father diogo and then with the chanting voices of all the europeans until it seems that the whole world is praying
next morning the camp on the beach is being broken up
the place is like a junkyard
the amount of damage that a hundred and fifty people can do to a beach in two days is impressive
dom paulo and the officers watch the work
with them are some messengers from the king and the slave translator
one of the messengers is talking
when he finishes the slave translates
they will look after the sick
but the king would like one thing
the machine that makes music
we need food as well
to take with us
then the king can have the music
hector is sitting beside nuno on a box talking earnestly to him
andre stands beside them
you must come with us
your mother might not get well
do you understand that
thats why i have to stay
what will you do then
follow you and the others
nuno remains silent
let him be
dom paulo and father diogo are standing beside dom paulos table all that remains of his headquarters on the beach
ill comfort them as best as i can
youre staying with them
father diogo hastens to correct this misunderstanding
no no ill comfort them before we leave
i think my place is with you
two sailors like stagehands enter and remove the table leaving dom paulo and father diogo propless on the beach
the trek from the beach to the village has started
a long line of people including some local natives carry the sick in crudely made litters
even this short trip is hard
somewhere in the line six sailors manhandle the harmonium up the jungle path
just behind them hector is helping nuno to carry his mother in a litter
it is like a civilization on the move
in a day or two the wind and the sea will have rubbed out all evidence of their stay and the bay will welcome its regular tenants the turtles
there is a sense of bustle in the native village as the european sick are settled into their huts and the others prepare to depart
emotional farewells take place in dark corners of the small huts
a group of unmoved sailors are playing cards in the dirt
in amongst the bustle hector is looking for francisco
he finds him taking some of his possessions into a hut
i have to see her before we leave
ill ask her
francisco goes into the hut
hector waits outside watching the small human dramas all around him
soon francisco emerges from the hut
in you go
hector goes into the hut stooping low at the small entrance
ursula is lying in a darkened corner
hector is shaken by the sight of her ashen and fevered but tries not to show it
he kneels beside her
she turns her eyes to him but doesnt speak
were leaving soon
ive come to say goodbye
her voice is a whisper
i wont forget you
i wont forget india
i cant forget how i hurt you
she looks at him but doesnt or cannot speak
we should have talked
i could have explained
she manages a whispered word
ill pray for you in lisbon
at the cathedral
she lies still
hector lingers for a moment
then he speaks again
im sorry i hurt your pride
hector has blown it
ursula pulls herself up on an elbow finding wells of energy from sheer indignation
hector is astonished almost jumping out of his skin
what did you say
what are you talking about
ursula speaks one word and then falls back into a dead faint
she lies still
hector leans over her to make sure she is still breathing
he whispers nervously
outside the hut dom paulo is talking with francisco
we wont forget you or what you are doing for these poor people
im not staying here with the intention of dying dom paulo
well be following you
when we are fit and well
yes of course
and good luck to you
they make what they both know is their final parting
god protect you
it breaks my heart to leave you all here but i dont know what else i can do
they shake hands
were leaving the cross with you
oh thank you
its too heavy to carry
and who knows
it might make some impression on the heathens
hector comes out of the hut solemn faced
francisco i must talk to you alone
hector takes francisco by the arm and leads him behind the hut
youve made your peace with her
i think so
is there anything that i can do for you
francisco laughs softly
if you were carrying something for me i would have to worry about you
if you go empty handed i can put you out of my mind
hector smiles uncertainly unsure if francisco is making a joke
then he becomes more serious
i want to ask you something
theres no easy way to do it
go on hector
francisco looks down at his boots
what about them
can i have them
you can have mine
theyll be fine for here
but i have to walk six hundred miles
hector lifts a foot to show francisco his boot
francisco is stunned into silence
but then a smile comes to his face
yes youre right
i daresay my boots would take you six hundred miles
i look after them
hector becomes almost poetic in his pleading
ill walk all the way home francisco
ill pray for your soul in the cathedral in lisbon
in my boots
francisco starts to laugh out loud
hector you have surpassed yourself
sit down and take my boots
francisco starts to take off his boots
hector does the same
he cant believe his luck
at this moment he loves francisco
he makes nonsensical small talk hopping around on one foot
they were made by da fosca werent they
francisco is giggling now
the best bootmaker in goa
pray for my soul in lisbon hector
and pray for your own
francisco is laughing but hector doesnt get the joke
a different forest
a wilderness of giant pines ranging through the mountains for hundred of miles
it is late in the year
there is one human sound in the cold still ness a voice singing
bobby the owner of the voice has a pack on his back
he is making his way up a steep slope to an area of flat ground
he stops singing looks around and calls out in a powerful voice
bobby looks around the abandoned camp the dead fires cleared areas for tents
up the slope and into view comes his companion leading a laden pack horse
it is hector
theyve been gone a week at least
were ten days late
they look at each other
they are in trouble and now they know it
have a look around
ill start on a fire
hector has scoured the campsite
he holds up a canteen he has found
well done my lad
hector walks to the fire pleased with himself
bobby unfolds his fist and looks at what he has found an indian arrowhead with a few inches of broken shaft
he folds his hand over it again keeping his secret
behind them nailed to a tree is a plaque their companions have left
it reads pennsylvania boundary expedition marker
also on the plaque someone has written we left here th october
hector and bobby sit by the fire with their supper
they are both anxious but pretend not to be
even if we lose their track well still hit the river
we cant miss that
its too high for indians
much too high
you wont find an indian up here
we just have to keep our heads
if you did find an indian what would he be
but he might be a delaware if you did
we keep working
we can log the peaks on the far side just a couple of sightings a day
keep us busy
their forced tone of matter of factness only serves to heighten the growing feeling of doom
you think well get out
if we keep our heads
i wish i had some tobacco
hector is lying awake watching bobbys sleeping form on the ground at the other side of the dying fire
behind bobby is a wolf sniffing and edging his way closer to them
hector isnt anxious
he knows the wolf will soon become aware of them and move off
he is worried about something else
from under the pack that makes his pillow he pulls a piece of broken arrow a shaft and some feathers the other end of bobbys find
he looks at it then looks back to bobby and the wolf
in the morning hector and bobby are taking readings from the instruments they have hung on a large tree main taining the disciplines of their work
it gives some shape and meaning to their predicament
twenty eight and three eighths
forty two and a half
hector writes it in the log book
bobby goes to the horse and takes a brass chronometer from a box strapped to the saddle
hector takes out a smaller chronometer from his own pack
they compare readings
there is a difference of some four or five minutes in the time
its getting worse
youre nearly five minutes fast now
im not fast
youre slowing down
they obviously have this tiff every morning
whats the point of having two chronometers when you dont take the average
you should throw yours away
youre unscientific bobby
hector writes in the book
he speaks pointedly
seven twenty five
bobby mocks him with a laugh
bobby is leading the horse and hector walks on ahead
the going is easy through the ferns and grasses
bobby for a moment forgets his apprehensions and starts to sing loudly
i see her in the dewy flowers i see her sweet and fair
his voice rings sharply around the forest
hector far ahead turns around taken by surprise
bobby has frightened himself too
he eyes the forest all around as the echo of his voice fades
chastened he begins to sing again quietly this time under his breath
theres not a bonny bird that sings but minds me o my jean
hector and bobby have stopped at a point of bare rock looking out across the broad valley
they are building a pile of stones a cairn
they work quietly methodically
the only sounds are of their breathing and the click clack of the stones
we feel the echoes of our many previous hectors and their piles of stones built for this or that purpose
our doomed surveyors are acting out the same ritual this time in the name of science
they finish the cairn and erect their heavy tripod over it and dangle a plumb line from the tripod
bobby scratches the center point on the top stone of the cairn
they are establishing a survey point
they talk as they work
when they anchor their tripod the cold hard sound of their chisels striking rock echoes all through the forest
it unnerves them
they stop hammering and listen to the echo bouncing down the valley
sure this is a good idea
lets get out of here
they hastily dismantle the equipment and load up the horse in an atmosphere of controlled panic
they are travelling together now on either side of the horses nose finding comfort in the closeness of each other
they stop for bobby to consult his compass
he indicates a slight change of direction and they move off again
still they dont talk
we can feel their anxiety breeding in the silence
why dont they talk
they proceed in this weighty silence but even the cries of the birds now seem to mock them
the route takes them downhill
the slopes are more dense with undergrowth now and the going isnt so easy
some times they are reduced to an undignified scramble hanging onto the bulk of the horse between them
they no longer look much like conquerors of the wilderness
they are on the valley floor now
the trees are more openly spaced and the grass is richer
they are moving quickly but they have a hard time keeping the horse on the trot
it hasnt seen grass this good in weeks
they are moving more slowly the ground is rockier and the trees are thickening
they take the easy way up the hillside a natural path made by deer or bear
it is difficult to know who is more shaken by their encounter the indian or hector and bobby
the indian is sitting behind a tree as they pass dozing or deep in reverie
they almost pass without noticing him but hector gives a turn of his head and there is the indian four feet from him
at the same instant the indian comes to his senses and sits bolt upright
the encounter is high comedy but full of terror for all of them
the indian stands up
hector absurdly greets him
the indian backs off from them holding his hands up and smiling crazily as if to say dont mind me boys im just leaving
hector and bobby are equally silly in their response
hey come back
were just moving through
we all got a fright
the indian is in full retreat now waving his hands about apologetically but making good distance from them
suddenly he is gone
it has happened so quickly that hector and bobby scarcely believe it has happened
then they realize that in their fright they have let go of the horse
it has headed back down to the tastier pastures in the valley
they see it disappearing into the trees below them
that was stupid
did you see him
sure i saw him
was he a delaware
how the fuck should i know
he was an indian
and indians dont come in ones
i think he was an indian too
what about the horse
im not going back down there
dont panic bobby
he runs off into the forest
then he turns and shouts to hector
hector follows him a mad race through the forest
hector and bobby are sitting on a rock gathering their wits
it is odd how they talk so matter of factly
what did you see
same as you
with long hair
kind of short
he wast tall
thats the one
hector scans the hills above them
lets get a bit further up
they move off
bobby looks at hectors backpack
whatve you got in there
some food the logbooks my letters a candle
they have stopped to make camp
it is late afternoon the sky just darkening sharp shadows on the far peaks a purple glow in the air
we wont have a fire tonight
we should make a shelter though in case it snows
what about bears without a fire
bobby laughs quietly
dont even think about bears hector
they are making a round frame of bent branches and cover ing it with foliage
half hidden in the undergrowth it is big enough for two men to huddle in
tonight they feel the most basic of urges to curl up in a ball and hide
they are safe and snug in their hideaway
hector has lit his candle
he is reading his letters holding them close to his eyes in the dimness
he has the air of someone putting his affairs in order
bobby is thinking aloud
maybe hes lost too
on his own
must be delaware
they were chased up here years ago
everybody thought theyd cleared off west
the other side of ohio
they were an angry lot
they used to farm on the coast
he looks up at hector and allows himself a small smile
go on read it out
hector looks up
ive had to listen to it every night since april
why not now
hector gives in
he holds a scrap of paper close to the candle and reads
dear father i miss you
three frogs are dead
everybody misses you
bring me a bears head and claws and a gun
school is good
miss white has married a fireman
come back soon
do not worry about the frogs they did not have names
hector looks up at bobby
its not so funny now as it was
it wasnt funny then
if you knew him
if you could picture him saying it
it would be funnier
i had a father like you
nine months on a whaler and then three weeks at home telling us all how much he missed us
im going home for the winter
bobby doesnt pursue his argument
he tenses then sniffs the air vigorously
hector sniffs some more
where the hell is it coming from
he puts his head out of the shelter
i cant tell
a night like this it could carry for miles
he huddles back inside the shelter
i wish i had a smoke
after a tense silence hector takes a small package from an inside pocket
he hands it to bobby
i was saving it
you have it
it is a wedge of tobacco
bobby takes it
what do you mean you were saving it
you know the rules
no hoarding tobacco or food
youve listened to me for a month day and night
wanting a smoke
well have it now
i dont smoke
youve kept it from me and you dont even use it
i was saving it for my birthday
i was going to give it to you then
i have to wait until your birthday for a smoke
who are you
the fucking king
go on smoke it
have it now
i bloody wont
im not smoking on your command
i bloody wont
there is a brooding silence
god your poor children
what do they have to do for a piece of candy in your house
its very hard to like you sometimes
dyou know that
i know bobby
but thats how i feel about you too
thats why were friends
we try hard
smoke your pipe
hector is neatly turning the tables on bobby who now appears churlish childish
ill have it in the morning
who would you rather be sitting here with
have a think
bobby does and then breaks into a smile
hector smiles too
he would be a help
but after daniel boone
i cant think of anyone else
but youre impossible to like sometimes
suddenly bobby grows shy of their growing intimacy
we should sleep
weve got a lot of running to do in the morning
but hector has other plans
he is in control of their friendship now
no were not
were going to talk
bobby yields to this with the softest most vulnerable smile we have yet seen on his face
where do you want to start
bobby is silent but still smiles his acquiescent smile
hector reads the silence well
i know where you want to start
bobby is still silent
bobbys smile breaks into a boyish laugh
what about alicia
what do you mean youre sorry
im the one that has to apologize
bobby is mischievous now
oh no youre not
it will be a worthwhile night for both of them
it is a glorious dawn
bobby sits looking out on the valley smoking his pipe
behind him hector is busy writing in his log book
isnt it a beautiful day
hector finishes his writing tears out the page from his book
he offers it to bobby
ive said who we are and where were headed
want to sign it write anything
the peak we logged yesterday
ive named it nathanial mountain
after my boy
is that fine with you
i was going to call it tobacco mountain
or mount alicia
but nathaniels fine
he puts the paper in a small leather pouch puts the pouch on the ground near the shelter and starts to build a small pile of protective stones on top
bobby stands and turns to watch him
lets get away from here
keep the sun on our backs
bobby walks off with great clouds of tobacco smoke billowing defiantly around him as if to challenge their night time tormentor
hector takes a last look at their shelter and its little memorial cairn and then runs to catch up with bobby
hector and bobby look vulnerable as they walk through the open forest with their meager packs on their backs
we can move quicker without the horse
we just have to keep moving
we have to get away from here
behind them they dont see the figure moving from the cover of one tree to another and then another figure following the first
they move like ghosts
bobby is a few steps ahead of hector
he dips down over a rise and instantly returns
he throws himself and hector to the ground
hector tries to struggle free
theyre on the other side
hector ducks lower hugging the ground
bobby is already sliding up the slope to look over the rise
hector follows him
on the other side they see the women and children of a small group of indians at the edge of a stream
the women are washing clothes the children are splashing and playing
we are close enough to hear their laughter
were right in the middle of them
does it have to be bad
they might be friendly
they were chased here
they should be on the coast growing corn
bobby turns to hector to make his point
that is when he sees the first of the figures just the ghost of a shadow moving from tree to rock
his eyes flick across the forest behind them
he sees another figure caught in the act of seeking cover looking absurdly embarrassed for the fleeting moment that we see it
then bobby sees another
are they teasing them
it looks so much like a game children would play
theyre behind us
they must think were stalking the women
hector looks and sees nothing
fifty indians hold their breath
the forest seems empty
but hector looks at bobby
he is grey faced a man who is looking at death
hector knows they are doomed
do you want to run
ill do what you do
they leap to their feet and run
there is only one way to go over the rise through the women and children and across the stream
to the watching indians it looks like a direct attack on their families
from behind trees and rocks they emerge and begin the chase
a tragedy of misunderstanding
hector and bobby scatter the women and children and splash across the stream burning all their energy in this mad life or death race
although their families are safe the indians keep up the chase the moment of confusion compounded in action
they lope easily after them waiting for the white men to tire
there are no whoops or shouts
they follow hector and bobby into the trees spreading out on either side shaping the human net that will soon engulf them
it is a menacing spectacle
death is near
hector and bobby stay close together as they run
when they catch up
itll be quicker
fight like hell
theyre not going to catch us
were going home
hector stretches out an arm to bobby
hold my hand bobby
they hold hands and run
a war party of media people surround hector as he exits a yellow cab
he forces his way through the yelling crowd of reporters and camera crews
hector is trying to make his way into a crumbling apartment building in queens
policemen help hector through the barrage of shouted questions
do you know the lady mr
think youll go to jail again
look here for a second will you mr
will you talk to us when you come out
hector enters the building
the media mob immediately switch off their energy
they light cigarettes fiddle with cameras stare into space as if someone has shouted cut
hector climbs to the fourth floor
a policeman goes with him
two paramedics come up the stairs behind them carrying a stretcher
the policeman stops
you guys are downstairs
the paramedics turn around and head back down the stairs
hector looks at the policeman curiously
youre forty eight
they continue climbing
hector and the policeman squeeze past a cluster of people at the door and enter the apartment
this is troup
a detective is with another man who looks like a city official
come here troup
hector joins them
you bring everything
building warrant license fire certificate sanitation certificate
i want them all
this is mr
santiago from the city
this isnt really my building
its my partners
i just took the call and came right over
i have to leave town in an hour or so anyway
slow down troup
so its on a friday
youre staying here til mr
santiago gets the paperwork
get your partner over here with everything
this is serious
hector looks at his watch
i might have to close the place down
where is she
the detective and hector walk down the hall
they stop at the door of the bathroom
hector looks inside
there is a large ragged hole in the floor
at the far side of it the toilet unit dangles at a dangerous angle into the hole held only by its plumbing
firemen are working to secure it and what is left of the floor with metal props and hydraulic jacks
lying on the floor below surrounded by rubble and being attended by the paramedics is an old lady mrs
she tries to sit up when she sees hector peering at her over the rim of the hole
she looks angry
i phoned you monday
i told you the floor was making noises
not me mrs
my ex partner
i think you spoke to him
how are you feeling
hector says this clearly for the benefit of the detective and mr
the detecitve is unimpressed
come back from there troup the floors still moving
ill make a couple of calls
ill straighten it out
is she bad
why dont they move her
they waited for a portable x ray machine
they can move her now
she seems in good spirits
as if in response mrs
philippopolis shouts up to hector as she sees him leaving the bathroom above her
wait til my son sees his mother lying here like this
hes gonna sue you
youre a lousy landlord
you should be ashamed
to let old people live like this
i phoned you monday
i have a witness
i was dancing with a prince on my eighteenth birthday and now look at me
you have me falling down a toilet
hector retreats into the hallway
takes out his mobile phone and dials while watching the ominous mr
santiago making copius notes in his book
hector gets connected
why did you do this to me
get down here now
they want all kinds of certificates
they wont let me leave the building
i have my kids tonight i havent seen them in four years
i did tell you ive been talking about it all week
how come they phoned me this isnt my building
dont tell me anymore
i want you here now
and on your knee
ill phone the lawyer
but you move
my weekends ruined before its started
hector quickly dials another number
you have to help me
im still in queens
ive got cops here and everything i need your car
i dont have time to pick up the rental now
they wont let me leave the building
you come down here
and put my bag in the car
i have to pick the kids up by six otherwise i fuck up her weekend too
shell kill me
this is an emergency
what can i say
he finishes the call just as santiago approaches waving his notebook now full of incriminating notes
it looks like water rotted the floor
you have any plumbing maintenance records
at the office
i might have some bills
its not my building
santiago is talking almost to himself now absorbed in the mundane mechanics of hectors building
its a weird one
i dont know how water could sit in there for so long without somebody noticing you didnt use water resistent paint on the ceilings did you
hector shakes his head wearily
i dont really know
youre going to have to check out the whole building
you know that dont you
can i do it monday
itll take you a month
hector is already dialing another number as santiago wanders off in search of further fascinating discoveries
can i speak with leonard please
my name is hector troup borlonski and troup real estate
there is a moments pause
borlonski and troup
listen weve had a domestic accident at our eighth street building
a floor and an old lady
she did mention the word sue but it might have been hysterics
what i need to know is what certificates you have on file for the building
i know its friday
just do one thing
let me know if the insurance is current
i need to know that
im on my mobile
anything you have
before five thank you
during the call hector has walked down the hall and back to the hole in the floor
he sees mrs
philippopolis now strapped in a stretcher being carried out of the room below
at the sight of him she tries to sit up straining on her straps
my sons downstairs
when he sees me like this hell kill you
jump through the hole
see what it feels like
break both legs
hector is almost tempted to do what she says
hector is following the paramedics as they negotiate mrs
philippopolis down the three flights of stairs
he is on the phone again
this time to his former wife
ill be on the way in thirty minutes at the outside
i cant say
queens to new jersey on a friday
what do you think
ill be there
its important to me too ive been trying to put this weekend together for years
ill be there
i wont take it out on the kids i can walk away from problems
as soon as i get the car
ill be there
all the while mrs
philippopolis issues a non stop torrent of greek expletives calmly and in a considered tone but obviously obscene
hector is shocked
on a street hector stands with a policeman watching mrs
philippopolis being loaded into the ambulance
her son is with her
when she is safely inside he walks towards hector
fortunately he is of modest build and a head shorter than hector and he seems to be saving his wrath for the courthouse
troup im george philippopolis
they shake hands
im sorry about your mother
you want to travel with us or do you have a car
to the hospital
well i wasnt planning to
youre not making a visit to the hospital
ive talked to your mother given her my best wishes
she wants her family with her now
any other friday but this one
the son addresses the policeman
hes not coming to the hospital
the policeman looks at hector
that could look bad
the cop is enjoying his role as straight man to these two
hector takes out his diary
heres what i can do
ill visit her on tuesday ill organize some flowers
screw the flowers
whos gonna check her into the hospital
whos gonna pay
its your building that fell down
he nods his head to the policeman
they wont let me leave here
the policeman this time backs him up
the son backs off to the waiting ambulance reluctantly
wait til they hear this in court he wouldnt even make a trip to the hospital
cant you even give me a credit card number
the ambulance drives off just as boris arrives
hector runs to the car
its never been this bad boris
deutsch is checking the insurance
did you bring the rest
were covered for most things
the license is current the inspection certificate is okay
whats with the we
its your problem
how is she
shes a witch
her bones must be made of steel
she didnt break a thing
it might help if you make a visit to the hospital
why did you do this to me
im sorry hector
i just put your name on the lousy forms
i didnt plan this
i just borrowed your name on the titles
hector doesnt let up on his anger
i told you to stop doing that
why does this keep happening to me
my name is mine
use your own name boris borlonski
will you remember that
boris is conciliatory
ill take care of it
dont let it spoil your weekend
four years huh
you make the most of it
and dont worry youll walk away from this
hector is calm now
we can sense real depth in their relationship despite boriss pranks
yeah im sorry too
you have to get out of this business
i thought i had
have a great weekend
ill talk to you on monday
well straighten everything out
this is the worst its been
everything can be fixed
then hectors girl friend anna arrives in her car
it is a bright pink station wagon highly decorated with flower motifs and slogans like annas arrangements and fresh or dry well please the eye
anna is a florist
hector brightens when he sees her
everything is falling into place
all he has to do now is cross two rivers and manhatan island in under an hour in annas pink car
he runs to meet her
you can dropp me at the shop
hector gets into the car smiling broadly
anna drives skilfully through the busy friday streets
you bring my bag
your cameras in there too
take some photographs of the kids
just like im being executed
well you deserve to suffer
our hectors have been hearing this for centuries but at least anna smiles when she says it
this is the beginning of something
not the end
you can start being a father again
im glad you talked me into it
i didnt do much
you were ready
youre absolutely right
i was ready
i am ready for everything
im fixing all that shit with boris
i told him
it cant go on
i want my freedom
anna is looking at him amusedly nodding her head with every earnest pronouncement that he makes
and the kids
thatll work out
we can have them over sometimes
that was the plan
when we have the space
right when we have the space
when we get the bigger apartment
there you go
you said it
the bigger apartment together
hector is pleased with himself
i said it didnt i
youre a man of decision hector
hector is high on his optimism now and cheeky with it
yes i am
i said it and get out of my car at the corner here
i dont have the time to go round the block
anna pulls into the curb
hector leans over to embrace her before she has stopped the car
for the car
do the best you can with them hector
and one more thing
she indicates a massive bouquet of flowers wrapped in cellophane taking up the whole of the luggage space in the car
anna i cant
heres the address
just two blocks before the bridge
a five minute detour
its a golden wedding
you have to
she looks him straight in the eye
we have to help each other
hector accepts this
oh youll need gas too
go to it hector
she kisses him quickly but lovingly
phone if theres any disasters
dont suffer alone
hector watches anna stride in her business like way around the corner out of sight
he is almost home
a trip from queens to new jersey at five oclock on a friday afternoon is going to look like a dream sequence whatever you do with it and thats fine
hectors trip to his children has more meaning for us than a simple journey from a to b
we will be aware of our other hectors and the journeys home that they did or didnt manage to make
this car trip will pull the threads together
and after so many images of the natural world a world little altered by man the panoramic shots of new york in all its mad glory will place our hector
in a new dimen sion
if there is a breathtaking moment in this film when everything comes together when all the pieces fit then it will be somewhere around here that it happens
six thousand years ago we left hector on a beach aching for his family
if the traffic allows tonight in new jersey hector will complete his journey
we will go with hector over the bridge across the avenues of manhattan and through the tunnel
his phone hello
yes now i know gods a lawyer
on the outskirts of jersey city he finds the suburban street he is looking for
if the last crosslight holds on green then he might even make it on time
hector stops the car outside janets house and lets out a sigh of relief
hectors former wife janet and her new husband donald come out of the house as hector walks up to the door
donald is carrying luggage and heads straight for their car in the driveway
he starts loading up the car
janet talks to hector
you made it
the kids are just coming
theyre not over the moon about going to the beach house
i ought to warn you
why didnt you say
i could have fixed up something else
i thought it would be a good place to get to know them again
well i figured you should be allowed to make your own mistakes
its only for a couple of nights they can take it
and youll learn
check into a hotel if it gets too much
they like hotels
she shouts into the house
come on you two
your fathers ready to go
she hands hector a piece of paper
this is where well be if anything crops up
thanks for the break
hector gets a little scared about what he has taken on
maybe this is a bit sudden for them
maybe i should have come over a couple of nights and got to know them
janet doesnt let him off the hook
by monday youll know them
then the children come out of the house betsy who is about thirteen and tom who is eleven
here he is the invisible dad
she turns to hector
thats what they call you
hector is daunted by how grown up they are not any more the little kids in the photograph in his wallet
they hardly lift their heads to him
janet takes control of the farewells
you three have a good weekend
if its too miserable at the house your father said hell take you to a hotel
hector nods his head obediently
he always did with janet
the children let their mother pat them and follow hector to his car eyes to the ground
good luck hector
donald shouts from behind the wheel of his car where he has been hiding
see you monday hector
the kids load themselves into the back of hectors car
betsy notices the huge arrangement of flowers wrapped in cellophane and red ribbon
it seems to have grown even larger than before
are those for mom
hector looks at the flowers
his face contorts in guilt and anxiety
jesus save me
what have i done
he picks up his mobile phone and is about to dial annas number then he stops
i cant face it not just now
he looks at the kids
they are driving on the freeway
it is dusk
hector is on the telephone again
he cant let go of business
excuse me kids
i have to consult the oracle
he gets connected
no leonard its hector
just a joke
sorry to phone you at home did boris call you
the insurance is fine
good but she could claim negligence oh shes got a lawyer already
thats a bad omen
betsy and tom are listening in the back seat eager for clues about this virtual stranger in front of them
is there anything we can do right now
make her an offer
sure with the insurance company
i have the kids in the car with me right now
sorry to bother you
hector throws the phone onto the passenger seat lets out a sigh and catches sight of the kids in the mirror
their perplexed expressions make them look younger than they are and vulnerable
hectors heart aches for them
he smiles and puts on an act of brightness
the last call
the weekend starts right now
we have things to do
look out for a safeway
we need some supplies
oh my god gas
they return his look with blank expressions
he picks up the phone and offers it to them
want to make any calls
she shakes her head
and its thomas
but we called you tom
thats what it says on your birth certificate
i changed it
hector wisely lets it go
its your name
you can do that
keep your eyes skinned
and i could murder a chicken mcnugget
hector is pushing a cart around a large safeway
the place is almost deserted
betsy and thomas are tagging along
for every four items hector puts in his cart betsy removes three and returns them to the shelf
hector notices and puts up with it for a while
but when betsy returns the rolls of kitchen towel he has selected he makes a stand
he turns to face her
whats wrong with that
its a kitchen roll
why cant i pick a kitchen roll
betsy is defiant
and it isnt recycled
you dont care
you just buy junk
she picks up a more friendly brand of kitchen towel from the shelf and throws it into the cart
hector has the sense to back down
good point betsy
betsy keeps on the attack
everything you buy is junk
i dont eat steak
and whats this
she prods a packet of frozen hamburgers
why dont you ask us what we like
itll save you money
you buy junk we wont eat it
a trace of girlish common sense has crept into her voice
hector warms to her
hector pushes the cart to her
well get to it
ill just tag along
betsy moves off with the cart
i do it every week anyway
thomas backs her up
she tells us what to eat
we let her
hector follows them up the aisle
can i just keep a couple of those steaks
we cant live on chicken
hector is filling up the car in a gas station close to the safeway
an attractive woman is filling her car in the next line
her eyes and hectors meet
for some reason they exchange the smallest smile
for a few brief moments they are talking without words as their tanks fill
the ten billionth romance in the history of the planet sparks into life and fizzles out again in the twinkling of an eye
by the time their credit cards are back in their pockets their love is a memory
from the back of the car the kids have watched it all
betsy gives hector a withering look of disapproval as he climbs back into the car
back on the road it is later
the kids have fallen asleep
he watches them in their sleep searching for some traces of the little children that have haunted his thoughts for so many years the tots he abandoned
the car pulls up at the holiday house
hector gets out
it is dark but we can hear the sound of the sea and there is sand underfoot
hector walks to the house and unlocks the door
he puts on a couple of exterior lights
he carries thomas still sleeping from the car and into the house
betsy follows him still half asleep groaning fussily
she talks through her yawns
are you going to bring the flowers in
dont mention the flowers
later hector cant sleep
it has been too eventful a day
he sits bleary eyed watching a late night tv show
a man sits cross legged on a studio floor and is talking to a phone in viewer
the tv man has five small stones which he regularly scatters on the floor
this is good tony the stones are talking to me already
now heres something
tony are you planning a move
yes i am
ive been thinking about a move to california
the big one eh tony
these stones are really talking here
what are you planning for yourself in california
im hoping for an acting career mel
tony these stones really like what youre planning
there is no doubt in my mind about that
you have to be specific
these stones really want to tell you something be it love money or the purpose of your life
but i want a specific question from you
think about it
what do you want to know
or your income level next year
be as specific as you can tony
perhaps this might have enthralled one of our earlier hectors but our modern one is simply restless
he stands up and leaves the room
next door he watches the kids sleeping in their little holiday beds
hector watches them
weve seen our hectors do this before and we feel the echo
but as he turns to leave the room hector gets a fright
betsy starts talking loudly
at first hector thinks she is awake giving him into trouble but she is fast asleep
get me the books
all the books
all of the books
no no no
not the pancakes
not the pancakes
she changes in an instant from a bossy adolescent to a tearful crumpled little girl
she sobs pitifully
not the pancakes
hector is a confusion of feelings frightened fascinated impotent
how can he help her
how could he possibly unravel the secret of the pancakes what comfort could he offer his stranger daughter if he did
it is a spooky mystical moment for hector more mystical than the mumbo jumbo still issuing from the tv next door
find your true cosmic partner first time around
every weekday morning at three here on the psychic network
lucindas horoscope dating show
remember there is an answer and there is a special partner out there for you
hector moves quietly out of the room betsys sobs having subsided
just as he is closing the door he gets another surprise this time from the sleeping thomas
dont let the oil run out
yes you did
watch the oil
hector closes the bedroom door
he is one spooked moved human being
in the morning they are making breakfast in the kitchen
the kids are having juice and cereal
hector is scrambling some eggs
how about some eggs
they shake their heads
you dont eat eggs
how many have you got in there
is that all right
for a week maybe
hector does a little probing
how about pancakes betsy
dyou like pancakes
i just wondered
pancakes dont mean much to you
they dont mean a thing
the mystery of betsys pancake dream is evidently lost in infinity
hector changes the subject
i thought we could walk into town this morning
i saw the funfair when we came through last night
we dont go to funfairs
lets take the walk anyway
i brought some books
i want to stay home and read
hector is determined to make it work
were taking a walk
they are preparing to leave the house
thomas is still reluctant to go
its going to rain
we should stay
heres an umbrella
and there must be some old coats in here
i only have these im wearing
donald has some shoes
thomas is already in the cupboard under the stairs
he emerges with a pair of sturdy walking shoes
i dont know if i want to wear donalds shoes
hector declines to explain the complex reasons that he might have for not wanting to wear the shoes of his childrens replacement father
he sits down on the stairs to put them on
then something on the wall catches his eye
look at this
the kids heights have been marked on the wall on some long ago holiday
the dates are beside them
six years ago
look at that
he points to a mark and a date lower down on the wall
that was the flood
the sea came right up
donald says its the icecap melting
its going to get worse
thats why moms selling the place
it comes up every year
the last two
they are on the beach walking in the direction of town
hector strides ahead in a show of enthusiasm although awkward in donalds big shoes
the kids trail behind
he calls back to them
where are the birds
is it the wrong time of year
they dont come over so much
the shellfish have gone
thats what donald says
and it happens to be true
hector looks at the sky
he speaks quietly to himself
please dont rain
the light drizzle now falling is keeping away what few fun seekers there are left in town
the funfair is not much fun
it is the end of the season
hector and the kids are a sorry sight parading the empty alleys
the kids seem to glory in the misery of it all getting back at hector for four years of neglect
heavy hearted hector still tries to make a go of it
lets have a ride
he has stopped at some dated space rockets
the seats are wet
he pulls a wad of kitchen roll from his pocket and starts to wipe the seats
kitchen roll unbleached re cycled biodegradable
betsy has the grace to smile as the three of them climb aboard the rockets
as the attendant releases the brakes and cranks them up into the drizzle round and round hector knows that he has to do something to break the awful distance between
him and his kids
he looks at them
they sit grimly in their rockets one in front of him and one behind
their faces are set in expressions of what
then he realizes what is going on
they are waiting for him to open up to them talk to them seriously explain himself
he looks at betsys face and sees in it the years of his absence her stoicism her patience her courage
it moves him
he leans over to her
this is ridiculous
lets go somewhere and talk
betsy smiles her small patient smile
all right if you want to
hector looks to thomas
thomas vigorously nods his agreement
hector is happier
he looks down on the decrepit fairground
how do we land these things
the only place the small town has to offer is a deserted coffee shop on the shorefront
hector betsy and thomas sit at a corner table beyond them through the window is the beach and the ocean
sure you wont have a pancake betsy
betsy gets impatient
okay first question
the kids are ready for this
there is no coyness now
where have you been
what he means is why did you stay away
hector begins like a story teller embarking on a long saga
well thats a fair question
your mother and i got divorced
youre big enough to remember
she must have told you all that
sure she has
but lots of people get divorced
that doesnt mean they disappear
what can i tell you
i went kind of crazy after that for a good while
i came around a few times
well it wasnt easy
everything with her and donald happened pretty quickly
i missed you both really badly
but for a while i thought i should stay away until your mother got settled
no thats not really true
i missed you
but i was kind of crazy at the same time
your mother and i married young
i wasnt used to the freedom
it went to my head then you moved to new jersey
its forty minutes away on a slow bus
youre right youre right
i dont have too many excuses for the first year
the second year is easier
i was in jail
hector is pleased with this
a solid excuse
we were doing government work big contracts
there were some temptations
my boss asked me to shuffle a few papers
there was a lot of money in it
i had to testify against him
it was like killing somebody
hector thinks about this remembering the pain
for us there is the echo of the real killing that was done long ago
thomas wanted to visit you in jail but mom wouldnt let him
hector looks at thomas
thomas nods proudly
well i appreciate that
but im glad your mother didnt let you
ill tell you all about it some day
it was no fun
one year and eight months
we didnt even know when you got out
i wasnt in great shape
i sure didnt want you to see me then
so i got back to work
in real estate
found a partner we met in jail
the kids look shocked at this
hes a good man a good man
i like him
i mean it
hes my friend
thats what you do now
we rent apartments
but we want to get into commercial property
people are a nuisance
does that sound bad
betsy shrugs her shoulders
how should i know
hector carries on with his story
just recently ive been feeling good things have been going well
and i missed you two
so here we are
what about your girl friend
who told you about her
she wants to meet you real soon
she sells flowers
well you know that
and on monday shes probably going to kill me
the kids smile
betsy thinks that was her at the gas station
shut up tom
hector has to think to remember
did you think she was following us
shes always thinking up stories like that
she never stops
well if people dont tell you things
shes right thomas
people should talk more
so you havent been staying away because of us
what do you mean
is that what you thought
i was avoiding you two
you mustnt think that
they have almost exhausted themselves in this first bout of talking
hector looks out at the sea
the rains off
betsy and hector are sitting on the sea wall watching thomas play on the beach
the sun is emerging
i have to ask you something else
why did you leave just two days before my swimming test
hector is moved by the depth of her memory her pain
i didnt leave because it was two days before your test
it was just what your mother and i decided
i taught you how to swim
we went to the pool twice a week
why would i leave
thats what i mean
why did you leave just then
hector looks at betsy
she is beginning to cry silently
he puts a tentative arm around her shoulder
oh god betsy
betsy is still crying
it doesnt matter
how did you do in the test
hector leaves his limp arm on her shoulder
it is too soon for gestures of emotion
after a long moment she speaks
im a life saver now
hector doesnt make the obvious comment
his emotions are full
he hides his feelings in a gruff call to thomas
were going home
were having a barbecue
betsy said shell even let me eat a steak
hurry up tom
thomas breaks off from his play and runs towards them
dont call him tom he doesnt like it
somehow hector is touched by this
your mother said it when we split up
dont lose the children
didnt mean much at the time
but she was right
who said id let you eat a steak
there is a silence
then hector speaks
on monday will you come with me when i take the flowers back to anna
i cant face her alone
she wants to meet you anyway
youll be there right beside me
id have to take the morning off school
is that bad
no that could be good
betsy and hector are quite close now
just tell them you were with your invisible dad
hector and betsy are walking on the shore
thomas tags along behind them
whats she like
how did you meet her
the funny thing is i fell in love with her before i ever saw her
i smelled her
it was the day i got out of jail
i was on the train and she was sitting behind me
it was just this incredible perfume
remember id been inside for nearly two years with four hundred sweating males
she got off the train and i followed her
i couldnt help it
thats how good she is
she listened to a bum who followed her off a train
betsy looks at him kindly
but shes still going to kill me on monday
they share a laugh
betsy looks out to the ocean
i think ill paint the sunset tonight
its just like a big pancake up there isnt it
betsy doesnt take the bait
there is a silence
i remember when you two were tiny
i used to watch you sleeping
it was like now
i felt close to you could touch you
but you werent there
you were gone
dreamland just when i was closest to you you werent there
i felt it last night too
thats what its like
you should know that
im not smart about things like that usually
dont be so tough on yourself
you seem to want to be
you dont have to
we can do that
hector is out of his depth with this daughter of his
is that a joke
no i mean it
look out for yourself
hector looks at her in wonderment
one of those moments when another human being stands before you and is an utter mystery
who are you
whos inside there
youll never know
future generations of women are going to be just as unknowable to our hectors as past ones were
betsy moves off briskly along the beach
hector trails after her hooked
betsy and thomas are in a small fragile rowboat some distance from the shore
they are watching hector who is collecting a pile of large stones on the beach
another hector and another pile of stones
this one is making a fire for the barbecue
these human rituals never stop
i thought he was taller
well its been a while
i suppose so
hes getting fat too
i bet i could beat him at the breast stroke now
hector turns from his work
out at sea the kids look small and vulnerable
hector is more anxious than he should be out of practice at fatherhood
he calls to them
come on in kids
that boat doesnt look too safe
they call back to him
hector tries to relax but he doesnt have the confidence yet or something
he is edgy
ive just found you
i dont want to lose you
what would i tell your mother
come on in
he walks down to the water
the kids reluctantly pull on the oars and bring the little boat in
a few feet from the beach they hit some sand
the boat sticks
hector wades out in his shoes so far
then he calls to thomas
throw me the rope thomas ill pull you in
thomas throws the mooring rope to hector
it isnt attached to the boat
hector ends up with all of the rope in his hands
he stands there and they all laugh
this is one useless piece of rope thomas
just for a moment we have the image of our hector standing on the shoreline with a length of rope
an image with an echo from six thousand years ago
but this time hector is laughing and his kids are safe
at the very moment of sunset betsy is trying to capture it in a watercolor sketch
she has set up an easel on the beach
its like action painting
she works frantically on the picture racing the sun as it dips into the ocean
tough little betsy can even lose patience with the sun
why does it always go so fast
thomas is laughing at her
he has seen her attempt this before
hector has other concerns
he is trying to light his barbecue
match after match disappears into his elaborate stone structure only to fizzle out
the sun finally vanishes and betsy goes limp at her easel
the sun has won the race again
she and thomas watch hector trying to light the fire
after a while he is conscious of their amused attention on him then he becomes a little self conscious
i used to know how to do this
they laugh a little
i used to be really good at this
he wafts and blows ineffectually at a flicker of flame
theres not much of the caveman about him now
it is a calm dusk
hector is turning the meat on the barbecue
he is in a splendid frame of mind
the smell of civilization
hector serves the chicken onto their plates
he sits down beside them with his steak and a glass of wine
he watches thomas attack his chicken and smiles
id forgotten that
how you eat
like its your religion
things i like
you used to hum to yourself too when you ate
like everything was fine with the world
thomas tries it out eating and humming
it feels good to him
his head nods with the chewing and the tune
hey so i did
id forgotten about that
the early stars are appearing in the sky
hector lifts his eyes to a bright point low on the horizon
there she is
mercury doesnt rise til after midnight
hector is impressed by his son
we used to watch the stars
you could tell me the names of all the planets
you could recite them like a poem
at the tiny window upstairs in the old house
oh well not to worry
im glad you still like astronomy though
im not into star gazing so much were working on computer modelling
were trying to make a biosphere
a self sustaining life system
for inter stellar travel
but we always get a methane build up it doesnt matter what we do
this is at school
were making such a mess of the world one day were going to have to take off for somewhere else
sounds like donald said that
hector realizes how far his kids have travelled from him
he looks at them
well im glad you two are thinking about the old planet
im proud of you
look how beautiful everything is
sometimes i think its people that make it all wrong
we walk around with all our problems
betsy chimes in
i dont know
if it wasnt for us thered be nobody around to see it all
hector stands to fetch another baked potato from the fire
we see the three of them in a wide shot the evening sky now pulsing with more and more points of light
hectors voice and laughter carry to us
dont worry you two
ill tell you
its just a big black sheet up there with holes in it so the light comes through
thats the truth
the very latest
hector has come to rest and found peace at last however temporary here on the beach beneath the same stars that our first hector wailed at six thousand years ago
on monday he will face the music
the kids will go back home mrs
philippopolis will have to be dealt with and the wilting three hundred dollar bouquet of flowers
in general life will take over on monday
but at this moment of calm on the beach lets leave him while hes ahead
their voices ring out playfully across the expanse of darkening beach and light laden sky
wait a minute
the whole universe is inside a speck of dust thats lying in a ball of fluff in the cuff of a pair of pants hanging over the back of a
ill tell you
the whole thing
stars and everything
is sitting on the skin of a bubble of milk in a bowl of cornflakes
and somebodys just about to eat it
the three of them are laughing now
you dont get bubbles in skimmed milk
its half and half
perhaps thats just about as close as hector and his tribe of humans will ever come to working it all out
but they try
ive got a better one
were all inside a speck of pollen thats stuck to the wing of a bee while it sits on a flower
dont mention flowers betsy
please not tonight
and then after a long long pause
i have an idea betsy
were inside a pancake
what dyou think
why are you always talking about pancakes
whats wrong with you
youve got pancakes on the brain
