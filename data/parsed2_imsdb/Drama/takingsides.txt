by ronald harwood adapted from the play by ronald harwood final draft a man conducting beethoven
air raid in progress
bombs falling nearby
the orchestra continues to play
suddenly the lights go out
the music stops
a beam from a torch bouncing making shadows
an attendant carrying the torch hurries down the corridor
the air raid continues
he comes to a door knocks opens it and looks in
furtwangler the reichsminister
the sound of heavy footsteps approaching
the attendant turns his torch to light the way for three men in nazi uniform also with attendants and torches marching down the corridor
the attendant bows deeply as the reichsminister and his aide go through the door
the other man remains in the corridor on guard
candles light the room where the conductor shakes hands with the reichsminister
furtwangler i want to apologise personally for this power failure
i was so enjoying the performance
in times like these we need spiritual nourishment
a bomb explodes nearby
but i welcome this unexpected opportunity of talking to you
with great care when you came on to the platform tonight i thought you werent well
you looked tired a warning get away from this bombing
away from the war
yes you look tired
a crooked smile even in this light
on a screen scenes from leni riefenstahls triumph of the will
over this look at them
men women kids
boy did they love him
you see steve adolf hitler touched something deep real deep and savage and barbaric and it wont just go away overnight
its got to be rooted out
you know what i think
i think they were all nazis
and lets face it their leaders those bastards now on trial in nuremberg couldnt have done it alone
its these people they gave all the help that was needed
the film changes with a scratchy music soundtrack wagner
shots of high ranking nazis in an audience including josef goebbels listening
and theyre listening to and watching wilhelm furtwangler conducting
at the appropriate moment thats him
the nazis applaud
goebbels shakes hands with furtwangler
the film ends
sitting in the ruined cinema are two men general wallace with files on the table and beside him major steve arnold
a projectionist is standing in the door of the projection room
so you never heard of him
do you know who arturo toscanini is
hes as big as toscanini maybe even bigger
in this neck of the woods hes probably bob hope and betty grable rolled into one
jeez and i never heard of him
wallace glances at the file
you were in insurance before the war
conscientious determined dogged
amused they said i was dogged
well they say here that when you went on a case you stayed on it
looks up at steve
now we cant take every nazi in this country to trial although i would like to its an impossibility
so were going for the big boys in industry education law culture
like this bandleader
a smile well hes more than just a bandleader steve
hes a great conductor a gifted artist
but we believe that he sold himself to the devil
your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the nazi party
dont be impressed by him
i want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war
find wilhelm furtwangler guilty
he represents everything that was rotten in germany
steve wants to rise but wallace puts a hand on his shoulder to make him sit again
stay put steve
there is some other stuff that id like for you to see here
he nods to the projectionist then starts to go but stops
oh one thing that may be a problem
our occupation authorities in wiesbaden have a duty to help these poor unfortunates with their defence
they keep repeating we must be just we must be seen to be just
well ive only one thing to say to the liberals in wiesbaden fuck em
as he goes you answer to no one but me
is that understood
to the projectionist in the door show him the film
the projectionist starts the next reel
on the screen a berlin sequence
ruins a city devastated empty
flags of the four allied nations
posters of truman stalin churchill
that is the hand that dropped the bombs on defenceless rotterdam brussels belgrade
that is the hand that destroyed the cities villages and homes of russia
that is the hand that held the whip over the polish yugoslav french and norwegian slaves
that is the hand that took their food
steve watches expressionless
next reel please
on the screen shots of camp survivors
then shots of emaciated corpses being bulldozed into mass graves
sanitary conditions were so appalling that heavy equipment had to be brought in to speed the work of cleaning up
this was bergen belsen
the moment this appears steve rises and goes quickly
on the screen piles of cadavers
steve having a nightmare twisting turning moaning
he wakes with a cry
he is sweating
he turns on the light looks at a clock reaches for a cigarette lights it
he stares at the ceiling
later early morning
steve is at the basin in his small room shaving
a radio on a shelf
remember men no fraternisation
in a german town if you bow to a pretty girl or pat a blond child you bow to all that hitler stood for
you bow to his reign of blood
you caress the ideology that meant death and destruction
you never know who was a member of the nazi party
dont be fooled
steves car swerves round the corner and comes to a halt
a small crowd watch workmen on ladders hammering away at a stone swastika above the portico
american soldiers supervise
steve gets out of the car carrying an attache case and he too watches as the stone swastika falls and crashes into pieces on the road
one or two people clap most just stare
the american soldiers immediately hoist the stars and stripes
steve goes into the building
the sentry salutes
the driver of the car goes to the trunk and takes out a labelled duffel bag cans of film a case which holds a mm projector
a small boy sidles up to him cigarettes chewing gum
steve and sergeant adams ascending a grand winding but damaged staircase to the rear of a spacious entrance hall
a once impressive building
signs of bomb damage everywhere
german workmen doing repairs
american military personnel coming and going saluting steve who barely acknowledges them
they reach the landing
adams opens double doors and they go through
were gonna have the heating fixed by tonight
a few gilt chairs a workman trying to repair the stove
adams opens another door for steve
emmi is hanging the standard photograph of president truman on the wall
she turns to see steve and adams and is covered with confusion
she gives steve a little curtsey
fraulein this is major arnold
sir this is your secretary fraulein emmi straube
her files on your desk
they sent her over from admin
ill leave you to it
steve scrutinises emmi
shes embarrassed keeps her eyes downcast
steve goes to his desk opens a file reads
you live here in berlin
you do shorthand and typing
he nods goes on reading
okay lets see
how long were you in the camp for
says here because of your father
whats that mean
my father was one of the officers in the plot against hitler
they arrested the plotters and their families
your mother too
she suffered longer
she was in ravensbruck
and your father was executed
she nods keeps her eyes averted
he smiles sympathetically
im gonna call you emmi youre gonna call me steve
i got a list of stuff here id like you to get for me
he searches his pockets
if you need anything let me know
there have been messages for you
she consults the pad
a lieutenant david wills called from the allied kommandatura cultural affairs office in wiesbaden
i dont know who he is
steve starts to unpack his attache case
then there have been three calls from dr
furtwangler wanting to know when you wish to see him
i did not speak to him personally
she hands steve a typewritten sheet
he ignores it finds a list which he hands to her
he waits for her to read then think you can get me any of that
pleased oh yes major i have recordings of all his symphonies
i kept them safe during the bombing
my favourite is the seventh symphony
mines the eleventh
he only wrote nine major
im kidding emmi
what about a record player
you have that too
ours was damaged
surveys the room whats in those files
the names of the members of the berlin philharmonic orchestra since together with their questionnaires
major what am i to tell dr
you tell him nothing emmi
if he calls again you say you know nothing
were gonna keep him waiting while i get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses
and god help me with beethoven
she tries to smile back
a narrow street crowded busy noisy
some makeshift stalls set out trestle tables open suitcases people buying and selling every imaginable commodity
emmi wanders through the crowd passing a violinist helmuth rode wrapped up against the cold playing handels air on a g string a bowl for money at his feet
a passer by drops a cigarette butt in it
immediately rode retrieves the butt
emmi comes to a stall selling piles of gramophone records
she asks the stallholder a question
he points to another stall across the way
steve at his desk paging through files
a knock on the door
lieutenant david wills aged twenty four enters comes to steves desk stands to attention salutes
lieutenant wills reporting to major arnold
for chrissakes i hate that shit cut it out
im very sorry
whats your name
im your liaison officer with the allied kommandatura cultural affairs committee
sounds a lot of run
so they sent the big guns to check up on me
we recruiting children now
smiles i guess so sir
you call me sir again and ill make you listen to beethoven
david half smiles
where you from david
was born here in leipzig
i escaped in
my parents they sent me to my uncle in philadelphia
they were to follow
but they delayed and
nothing from steve
our family name was weill
but that doesnt sound well in english
my uncle changed it to wills and
the door opens and emmi enters carrying a record player sees david and starts to back out
come in emmi this is your office too
emmi this is lieutenant david wills
they nod briefly
he is here to watch over us
a flick from emmi
i guess you admire musicians
this is like a criminal investigation david
musicians morticians doctors lawyers butchers clerks
theyre all the same
for emmis benefit too
she becomes still listens
we have a duty a moral duty
david takes a few files sits and starts to look through them
steve returns to his files
emmi by now has put on a record and starts to play it the opening of beethovens fifth symphony blasts out
the two men look up startled
emmi beams it works
emmi at the door
steve at his desk
herr rudolf werner
werner enters bows to steve and david
emmi goes to her desk
sit down werner
indicates the upright chair werner sits
i want you to understand why youre here
this is an investigation into wilhelm furtwangler former prussian privy councillor banned from public life under control council directive no and whos applied to come before the tribunal of artists
of the denazification commission
im interested in what he was up to from to the end of the war understood
rudolf otto werner
wind section since
what instrument did you play
i have your questionnaire here
it says you were never a member of the nazi party
long silence steve watches him
werner is made more anxious
at last in a rush no i was never a nazi i have no interest in politics im a musician hey hey slow up fraulein straube has to take down
what you say
werner swivels round to look at emmi
any relation to colonel joachim straube
its a great honour to meet you fraulein
your father was a great patriot
furtwangler is a great musician
he actively opposed the nazis and later on he helped many jews to escape
then how do you explain him being made a prussian privy councillor
it was hermann goering
i was told he just made the maestro his privy councillor no questions asked
furtwangler stood up to him
and to dr
he also conducted for hitler didnt he
yes thats true but he refused to give the nazi salute
he kept his baton in his right hand
in hitlers presence
that was a brave act
to celebrate hitlers birthday with some heroic piece by wagner but without the nazi salute
it was beethovens ninth
do you really think it was brave
didnt he bow to him and shake his hand
another man schlee is in the chair
only steve and emmi now
pale yellow electric light
schlee too is very nervous
at last no no no i give you my word
i was never a member of the nazi party
i am in the percussion section
i play the timpani
steve just stares at him
anyway they would never have allowed it
my brother was married to a jewess may she rest in peace
and goebbels said
to emmi please take this down carefully because its most important fraulein
acting surprised straube
are you by any chance related to colonel joachim straube
he was a great hero
steve lights a cigarette
goebbels yes josef goebbels said theres not a single filthy jew left in germany on whose behalf dr
furtwangler has not intervened
no no one could have been less of a nazi than dr
but this was the same guy who conducted for adolf on his birthday
he was forced to do that
but he refused to give the nazi salute in front of hitler
he kept his baton in his hand you cant salute with a baton in your hand
and what about the nuremberg rally
we played on the evening before the rally
straight faced oh
the evening before i see
furtwangler was absolutely clear about this politics and art must be kept separate
politics and art must be kept separate
ill remember that
but let me see if you can help me with something i just dont understand
id really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him
whats his secret
schlee tries to find words
well its hard to explain
i can only tell you from my own experience
soon after i joined the orchestra we were rehearsing the third symphony of beethoven the eroica
there are several rather difficult passages for the timpani
one particular crescendo
during the break i asked how he wanted it played
he was studying his score
he didnt look up
he said just watch me
so of course i did
i never stopped watching him
the moment came
and suddenly he turned to me and our eyes were locked
there was something in his look that
that simply demanded the crescendo
i shall never forget his look
it was a moment of
steve nods thinks for a moment
then you ever seen adolf hitlers eyes when he was making a speech
ive seen em on films
was looking at furtwangler like that
i dont know what you mean major
when you got to the crescendo
schlee looks at him bewildered
in the back david and steve
the cars making its way along a road that skirts a lake towards a grand mansion from which fly the four allied flags
you think a whole orchestra what a hundred and forty or so guys could be orchestrated
i guess its possible
so what does the russki want
colonel dymshitz asked specially to see you
a huge cavernous room once the ballroom
in the centre a table with four chairs
to one side antique furniture objets dart paintings
four allied officers are surveying the treasures colonel dymshitz colonel green american major richards british and captain vernay french
what they say is barely audible low mumbles
theyre accompanied by aides with clipboards taking notes
beyond and some distance away a row of gilt chairs for observers where david and steve take their seats
what the hell are they doing
whispered theyre trying to sort out some of the works of art the nazis stole from occupied territories
who really owns what
thats colonel dymshitz on the far side
dymshitz small intelligent face cunning eyes
art historian head of the famous leningrad museum of art
he is an expert on german culture
green correct formal precise immaculate
richards bespectacled and nondescript
vernay upright proud
suddenly raising his voice je suis navre colonel cette peinture nest pas la propriete de iunion sovietique mats bien cette de la france
whats he saying
henri what is you saying
hes saying that picture is the property of france cest un braque qui avec picasso etait un des pionniers du cubisme
in french i know who georges braque is captain
almost simultaneously its a barque
we can produce the provenance of this braque you say provenance
outside the club room for the participants
buzz of conversation clink of glasses cups
the terrace is deserted
a waiter carries a tray with various refreshments to a quiet corner where dymshitz green vernay his aide lieutenant simon steve and david sit in comfortable armchairs
the waiter serves them
during this hello major my name is dymshitz
im glad to see you
so major tell me have you questioned dr
ive had two meetings with him
hes a great musician
maybe the greatest conductor in the world
his brahms beethoven schubert unequalled
steve makes a non committal gesture
ill come straight to point
ive offered him a very attractive position
conductor of the staatsoper unten den linden
but i want him
i want him badly
and i want your help
hey just a moment you should have discussed this with me first
im discussing it with you now
major i want you to drop your investigation save everybody time and trouble
we cant drop a case just like that
ill give you another conductor in exchange or writer musician actor what
what do you care
but i like furtwangler
hes my favourite conductor
mine and hitlers
hes our favourite conductor
rode is seated waiting
the sound of laughter davids laughter from the office
it makes him even more uncomfortable
emmi and david laughing
i clicked my heels saluted and bowed at the same time
she laughs again
thats because you had a proper upbringing
i was raised very strictly
so dont speak before you are spoken to
and dont wave your hands about
respect your elders and your betters
and no elbows on the table
eating is eating
and talking is talking
well i think we better get on
so this is going to be very formal too now
lieutenant david wills requests die pleasure of die company of fraulein emmi straube at dinner any night she cares
she smiles just as steve bursts in
hes in a bright cheerful energetic mood
david draws back guiltily
emmi embarrassed hesitates then turns to the typewriter and types furiously
seeing this steve stops but just for a brief moment
then as he goes to his desk david need to ask you something
you heard this rumour the british found something called the hinkel archive
so what is it
the british occupy the building where this guy hinkel ran the nazi ministry of culture and it seems theyve
theyve discovered his secret archive
whats that mean
i dont know but the british are excited about it i know that
the rumour is hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the third reich
and you think the britishll share it with their allies
major richards said hed call to let us know
thats big of him
he looks from david to emmi as if trying to work out something
then okay better question the next witness
i bet you a bottle of french champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes
its a bet
youre the witness emmi
rode in the witness chair
steve studying the file
david and emmi ready to take notes
helmuth alfred rode
second violinist since
whats it mean second violinist
it means i wasnt good enough to be a first violinist
he chuckles looks around for approval
steve grins encouragingly
good and according to your questionnaire helmuth you never joined the nazi party
i know everyone now says they were never nazis but in my case it is absolutely one hundred per cent true
i am a catholic it would have been totally against my conscience
steve lights a cigarette rode eyes it hungrily
is it true youre going to interview dr
ill ask the questions helmuth
did you know that he refused to give the nazi salute when hitler was present in the audience
steve flicks david a glance waggles his finger like a baton
the problem was how could he avoid giving the devils salute when satan was actually sitting there
modestly taps his chest with his thumb
and i said dr
furtwangler why not enter with the baton in your right hand
hitler will be sitting in the front row
if you give the salute with the baton in your right hand itll look like youre going to poke his eyes out
david mouths i win to steve
he was really grateful to me for that
after the concert i
i stole that baton as a memento of a great act of courage
i still have it
i should have brought it to show you
i hope im not going too fast for you fraulein
steve and david exchange a brief look
any relation to colonel joachim straube
standing i am deeply honoured to be in your presence fraulein straube
your father was a true patriot a man of god
he crosses himself
david raises a discreet finger
you have a question for helmuth david
what was the orchestras reaction when they asked you to play for hitlers birthday
oh we didnt play for his birthday we played the evening before it was the th of april not the th
do you know hans hinkel
alarmed do i know hans hinkel
thats what i asked
do i know hans hinkel
you seem to understand the question now how about answering it
hans hinkel was in the ministry of culture how could i know such a man
i brief silence a smile
i hear the british have his
his archive files records
do you know whats in this archive
how could i know whats in the archive
steve nods smiles
okay you can go now helmuth
rode stands and bows
the final bars of the fifth symphony
there is more furniture now two chairs one comfortable the other upright
a sitting area by the window with the telephone extension
the mm projector set up in another corner
steve at his desk wrapped up against the cold going through files making notes
he stops seems to listen then goes to the window looks out
the music ends
the record hisses
steve just stares out at the night and the snow
the record continues to hiss
the tram packed to overflowing
then a sudden stir among the passengers as people push through trying to find space
one of them is furtwangler
he stares ahead or keeps his eyes downcast
an elderly man tugs at his coat half rises offering his seat
furtwangler manages a smile and shakes his head
the tram rattles on
furtwangler approaches adams at his desk
he crosses to the stairs
german workmen stop what they are doing to let him pass
one of them bows
on the upper landing emmi is making her way to steves office
she stops sees furtwangler on the stairs and then dashes to steves door
emmi bursts in on steve and david
shes overawed major major
shut the door emmi
sit down emmi
were going to keep him waiting too
emmi glances out again and reluctantly closes the door steve sits calmly relaxed
emmi get us some coffee will you
and emmi dont offer him coffee
dont even greet him okay
furtwangler sits waiting
emmi deeply embarrassed hurries through
furtwangler is about to ask her something but shes gone
steve and david preparing papers
emmi enters from the landing door carrying a tray and three mugs of coffee
she hurries towards the office door eyes downcast
how long am i to be kept waiting
emmi bites her lip and without looking at him disappears into the office
furtwangler closes his eyes breathes deeply
he stands goes to the window looks out
steve studying his notes
david watching him
emmi staring forlornly into space
okay emmi go get him
emmi rises opens the door nods turns back to steve
as he passes her emmi gives him a small curtsey
steve doesnt look up
furtwangler waits a moment glances round sees the more comfortable chair and sits in it
steve looks up
i didnt hear anyone invite you to sit down
steve points to the other chair
i want you to understand why youre here
youre automatically banned from public life under control council directive no
were here to look into your case before you appear in front of the tribunal for artists of the denazification commission
you understand that
i have already been cleared by a denazification tribunal in austria
what they do in austria doesnt interest me one little bit
i have your questionnaire here reading gustav heinrich ernst martin wilhelm furtwangler born berlin january
and you say here you were never a member of the nazi party
that is correct
a very long silence
when the silence is unbearable steve speaks
could you tell us about being made a prussian privy councillor
how did that happen to a non party member
i received a telegram from hermann goering informing me that he had made me a privy councillor
i was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse
after the dreadful events of november the violent attacks on the jews i stopped using the title
what about vice president of the chamber of music you used that title didnt you
but then i suppose you had no choice there either because i suppose dr
goebbels just sent you a telegram saying dear mr
i dont think dr
goebbels sent me a telegram
i was simply told
in a letter i believe
i dont remember exactly
goebbels and goering were sure heaping honours on you
one makes you a privy councillor the other makes you vice president of the chamber of music and you werent even a member of the party how do you explain
well there was a constant battle between goering and goebbels as to which of them would control german culture
i was simply a pawn
anyway i resigned from the musikkammer at the same time i resigned as musical director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra
david puts up a hand
why was that
why did you resign dr
i wrote an open letter to the newspapers condemning what they were doing to music making these distinctions between jews and non jews
for my part the only divide in art is between good and bad
eventually goebbels summoned me and told me i could leave the country if i wanted to but under no condition would i ever be allowed to return
i always believe that you have to fight from the inside not from without
i asked myself whats the duty of an artist to stay or to leave
and then goebbels demanded that i acknowledge hitler as solely responsible for cultural policy
well that was a fact and it seemed pointless to deny it
i simply acknowledged that hitler and the minister of culture appointed by him were solely responsible for the cultural policy of the reich
what i wanted to express was that i personally had no responsibility whatsoever for their cultural policy
i have always had the view that art and politics should
should have nothing to do with each other
then why did you conduct at one of their nuremberg rallies
flaring i did not conduct at at the rally i conducted on the evening before the rally
that sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies wilhelm
and what about april
the eve of hitlers fifty third birthday the big celebration you conducted for hitler didnt you
was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other
that was a different matter i
i was tricked
could i have a glass of water please
steve looks expectant but furtwangler remains silent
steve nods to emmi who gets the water
i was in vienna rehearsing the ninth symphony of beethoven when goebbels called and said i had to conduct at hitlers birthday
id always managed to wriggle out of such invitations pleading previous engagements illness having my doctors state i was not well and so on and so on
i was also fortunate that baldur von shirach who controlled vienna hated dr
goebbels and would do anything to thwart his wishes
but this time goebbels got to my doctors before me they were frightened off and von schirach was threatened bullied and gave in
so i had no alternative but to conduct for hitler
believe me i knew i had compromised and i deeply regret it
playing with him doesnt sound much of a trick to me
sounds like you made a deal
i made no deal
i dont buy that
its the truth
then suddenly turns on furtwangler
i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape
how did you do that
i dont remember in detail there were so many
did you call someone you knew
i may have as
as i said i simply dont remember
let me me help you then
you picked up the phone and made a call mimes a telephone
listen old pal theres a jew boy musician i want you to help
he needs a permit to get to paris
emmi sticks her fingers in her ears and shuts her eyes tight
or maybe you called goebbels or goering
you were so close you were in the same shithouse as them
may i ask a question
when will my case be heard by the tribunal
your guess is as good as mine
i need to work
i need to make my living
i live off the generosity of friends
now more and more agitated then why is it please that another conductor who was actually a member of the party who used to play the horst wessel before his
concerts has already been cleared and is working again while i have to wait and wait and wait
i dont know he wasnt my case
why did you escape to switzerland just before the war ended
it was because i learned that the gestapo was about to arrest me
why were they going to arrest you
i believe it was because of another letter id written to goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies
you didnt complain about the racial policies just about the musical standards is that right
so how did you learn that the gestapo was out to get you
during an enforced hour long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in berlin albert speer the minister of armaments said to me you look very tired
furtwangler you should go abroad for a while
i knew exactly what he meant
you sure knew a lot of people in high places
it would be truer to say i think that a lot of people in high places knew me
you were real close to all of them to adolf to hermann to joseph to baldur and now albert flaring so lets hear the truth lets come clean
what was your party number
if you are going to bully me like this major you had better do your homework
you obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are
steve is stung
his eyes narrow dangerously
david you remember i said i had a question that he wouldnt be able to answer
well im gonna ask it now
you ready for this wilhelm
its a tough one
why didnt you get out right at the start when hitler came to power in
why didnt you leave germany
i have a list of names here people in your profession who got out in
bruno walter otto klemperer arnold schoenberg max reinhardt
they were jews they had to leave
they were right to leave
he breathes deeply summons strength
i could not leave my country in her deepest misery
after all i am a german
i stayed in my homeland
is that my sin in your eyes
he cant answer the question
ill ask it again wilhelm and dont give me any more airy fairy intellectual bullshit
the telephone rings
no one moves
then emmi picks up the telephone
major arnolds office
yes he is
offers the phone to david
its major richards for lieutenant wills
david takes the telephone
well you want me to tell him
okay to steve major richards wants a word with you sir
steve indicates hell take the call on the extension
as steve crosses to the extension muttering why cant he just ask for me
why does he have to ask for you first
goddamn british so correct
he picks up the extension
emmi puts down her receiver
ive had enough of this im leaving
he goes quickly
david dashes after him
waiting room day furtwangler is at the door when david reaches him
a warning dont
its not advisable
the sound of steve laughing with delight
emmi comes to the waiting room door watches as if on guard
david comes round to face furtwangler
he gathers courage when i was a child my father he took me to
he took me to one of your concerts
i remember you conducted beethovens fifth symphony
i was deeply moved
and ive loved music ever since
i was grateful to you
and ive admired you
how could you
how could you serve those criminals
he falls silent
emmi at the open door has been listening
shes shocked turns away to see steve on the extension chuckling grinning from ear to ear
jesus thats dynamite
david and furtwangler havent moved
both are looking towards steves office and emmi in the doorway
again the sound of steves laugh
then emmi steps into the room approaches furtwangler
he gives her a wonderful smile
and suddenly steve stands in the doorway smiling
arent we all sociable
the others are made awkward
ive got to hand it to the british david
you know what those guys are
he sits crosses his legs
tell me herr dr
furtwangler do you know hans hinkel
yes a despicable human being
he was in the ministry of culture
his job was to get rid of jews in the arts
yup thats him thats the guy
you know what else the little creep did
he kept files close on files
and you know whats in those files
certainly not but i knew he had informers everywhere
even in my orchestra there was someone who
i wasnt told
i just knew it
uneasy i was warned
who warned you
lowering his head goering
because hinkel was working for goebbels
what did goering say
he told me to be careful as one of goebbels men was watching me
he read a report on me everything i said was quoted word by word
oh boy youre gonna love this
take your time with this now
those files contain the details of every working artist in this country
those files are gonna tell us who joined the party who informed and who was helpful
furtwangler goes to the door
david opens it for him
furtwangler nods then turns to emmi bows to her and smiles
your name please
there is a long trestle table running the length of the room with chairs as if in a library
a notice requests silence
british and american servicemen a russian and a french officer studying papers making notes
at the furthest end steve david and emmi
the only condition is we have to do the work here
i want you to collect all the files on the boys in the band
david discovers that the archive room was originally a synagogue
he is moved
he lays stones on the rail of what was once the ark
emmi and david surrounded by files sifting through making notes
they examine the hinkel archive
sunshine pouring in
steve seated as before but emmi and david again in different places
emmi rises goes to steve shows him something
maybe you can have a look at this
he is not pleased
he writes furiously
emmi returns to her place
suddenly a movement causes steve to look up
steve and his pov david slides a note across to emmi
emmi reads the note
david watches her
she looks at him
she almost smiles nods surreptitiously
a whisper schubert
she feels steves eyes on her and returns quickly to her work
steve is displeased and even more suspicious
the first movement of schuberts string quintet in c major d played by three men and two women to a large audience packed into the ruins partly open to the
sky dymshitz among them
at the rear of the church emmi and david enraptured seated side by side
the first movement ends and the adagio begins
after the music gathers momentum rain
thunder and lightning
the musicians continue to play unperturbed
they are coming to the end of the quintet
david and emmi huddled together
some umbrellas up and then movement which catches davids attention
he nudges emmi i indicates with his chin
people have moved to reveal furtwangler seated wearing a hat still i as a statue soaked listening expressionless
the musicians bow
the audience start to leave
emmi and david emerge from the ruins
furtwangler passes them
they nod awkwardly
he doesnt respond but is about to walk on when dymshitz pushes through nods to david who salutes
dymshitz catches up with furtwangler
they are near to emmi and david
furtwangler furtwangler stops
moving you agree
whenever i hear schubert i am moved
the tempi were a little too correct for my taste
but i expect that is because of the rain
he nods politely is about to go also for davids benefit wait doctor i understand you have difficulties with the americans
i want you to know i am your champion
we can help
furtwangler allows himself a faint smile tips his hat and then hurries off into the night
dymshitz goes too
david and emmi watch them
then frowning worried what does he mean too correct
i dont know
huddled under their umbrella they dash off
steve fully dressed lies on the bed in his small shabby room staring into space
he is suddenly startled by a loud roll of thunder and then a fierce crack of lightning
he goes to the window watching the rain
he stands motionless for a second then makes a decision
he grabs his cap a raincoat from the back of the door
another loud thunderclap
dancers jitterbugging and jiving
among them david and emmi also dancing imitating the others and having a good time
the music ends
the band leaves the platform
the dancers return to tables or the bar
later david and emmi at their table eating
she eats voraciously eyes glazed all her concentration on the food in front of her
david is fascinated cant stop watching her
steve enters the club makes his way to the bar orders a drink
steve turns to survey the room almost at once spots david and emmi their backs to him
he observes them
david and emmi at their table they have finished their meal
emmi is silent now staring at her empty plate
steve is suddenly at their table
well what is this the office party
david and emmi are frozen with embarrassment
may i join you
sits down beams
so what have you two been up to tonight
dont i owe you a bottle of french champagne
tries to get a waiters attention but fails
you know david youre a lucky guy
i invited emmi here but she turned me down
you mustve hidden depths david
he band starts to play he stands holds out a hand
cmon emmi lets dance
ill teach you how to jive
she is horribly embarrassed doesnt move
david suddenly stands and takes emmi by the arm
im very sorry major but i promised her mother we have to go
they leave quickly
steve watches them
he sinks down angry and jealous
david and emmi enter the hall each locked in their own thoughts
they reach the foot of the stairs and pause
they want to kiss but both are too awkward
she starts up the stairs
dont see me to my door theres no need
but i promised your mother
she stops turns
well sleep well
she continues on her way
steve and emmi at work on the files
one or two british officers present and david who is working at the far end of the table
he has a cold
emmi who also has a cold opens a file and is immediately alert
she blows her nose
she is uncertain
she looks up at steve
she makes a decision
she rises takes the file to steve
excuse me major
i found this on helmuth rode
the second violinist
look hes austrian not german
but its this thats more important i think
she points to something
steve laughs loudly
david looks up at them puzzled
then a british sergeant comes into the doorway
lieutenant wills telephone david rises and as he goes exasperated what is this a railway station
in a booth near the front desk david is on the telephone
into telephone david
who in wiesbaden
irritated he taps the receiver but the lines gone dead
steve lies shirt off taking the sun
noise behind him of someone in the bushes
steve doesnt move
rode carrying a slender leather case pushes through to steve who remains with his eyes closed
eyes still closed helmuth
guess what i am holding in my hand
you like guessing games
love em helmuth
i give up
what are you holding in your hand
rode takes from the case a conductors baton
steve opens one eye
furtwanglers baton which i stole
the one he kept in his right hand
yes you remember
yes you remember
how could i forget
sits up takes the baton
somewhere a child laughs suddenly steve thrusts the baton at rode
yeah show me i want to see you do it
pretend im adolf
youre the maestro and you have the baton in your right hand but you give me the salute just the same
not here major there are people if anybody should see
please please major
do it helmuth
after nervous looks over his shoulder rode salutes half heartedly
do it right
rode thrusts his hand out in the nazi salute
people by the lake mostly elderly but some younger ones see rode saluting
some turn away
you look great doing that
rode and steve rode looks around nervously lowers his arm
and i see what you mean
you nearly poked my eyes out
replaces the baton gives steve the case
dont worry helmuth itll be our secret
a ball comes bounding towards them
steve catches it
then a boy runs in looks hopeful
mister mister here here mister
steve tosses the ball back to him
great catch kid
the boy runs off
you wanted to see me
steve pats the spot next to him and rode sits
you usually dont work on sunday major
all in the cause of humanity helmuth
or should i call you one zero four nine three three one
one zero four nine three three one
or dyou mind if i just call you one
rode makes an attempt to go but steve grabs him
you know what i say you are helmuth
i say youre a piece of shit
rode suddenly starts to retch
people by the lakeside faces turning at rodes sobs
steve and rode whos the bastard helmuth
he promised to remove your file
and what about before that
what were you a member of in austria
after a moment was a member of
barely audible i was a member of the communist party
i was a communist
thats what hinkel had over me
he knew everything
he held that over me
thats how he made me co operate
oh i see he made you co operate
and now are you a communist again
angry you dont know what its like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified you dont know that he stops
further along the lakeside steve and rode walk
boats on the lake
i would never in my wildest dreams have ever been a second violinist in the berlin philharmonic
when they got rid of the
the jews in the orchestra it gave people like me a chance
rode rowing steve in a small boat
rode exhausted stops
the boat drifts
steve watches him for a moment then helmuth you ever heard of plea bargaining
rode trying to catch his breath shakes his head
talk about power i have the power to give you work make your life easier
your past wont be mentioned
i could give you a job tomorrow but i have to get something in return
thats plea bargaining
rode keeps his head bowed
i can give you freedom of movement freedom to work freedom helmuth
but i need something in return
major were discussing a man of genius i dont want
fuck that helmuth
you want to discuss symbols here
this guy was a front man
he was the piper but he played their tune you get my philosophical meaning
im not interested in small fish im after moby dick
come on helmuth
then rode slowly raises his head
the only thing i know is hes an anti semite
like everyone else in this goddamn country
rode and steve walking
rode suddenly turns to him ive remembered something else
furtwangler sent hitler a telegram for his birthday
one of your people told me
one of my people
they start to walk away from the water
he said hed seen the telegram in the chancellery
son of a gun
well find the corporal and well find the telegram
he stops takes out a cigarette offers one to rode lights them both gives rode the packet
they smoke for a moment
but i need documentary proof
you know of anything like that
but thats why we hated him
we admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didnt have to join the party and yet he had a better life than any of
he didnt have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad
he got everything from them everything
he was filthier than any of us party members
the sun is setting
rode stops suddenly
theres a rumour
i dont know if its true or not
but ask him about von der null
never heard of him who is he
edwin von der null
he gave furtwangler terrible reviews while he raved about herbert von karajan
also a conductor
von der null called him the miracle von karajan
furtwangler was outraged and they say he had von der null conscripted into the army
the same thing happened to another critic
true or not its not such a bad idea
critics give you bad reviews you have them sent to the russian front
but if you really want to get furtwangler ask him about herbert von karajan
the miracle kid
yes yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name he
he refers to him as k
rode tries to make up his mind about something then decides
he reaches into an inside pocket and takes out a small black notebook
and ask him about his private life
his private life
rode hesitates then he hands steve the black book
yes its all in here
steve going along the shelves filled with files
hes at the h then i then j
he stops at the letter k
with his forefinger he runs down the files
he stops pulls out a fat file he opens the file
insert the file id photographs of an energetic looking young man and two nazi party membership booklets
david makes his way from the counter
he carries a tray with two cups of coffee
he goes to a table where captain martin sits papers and files spread before him
david gives him his coffee then sits across from him blows his nose
silence while they sugar and milk their coffee
david aware of martins eyes on him
where do you stand on all this
on all what
i dont know
he breaks off
you represent the united states now
we have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just
major arnold believes he has a moral duty too
our duty is to help furtwangler with his defence carefully thats why i want you to look at this
he selects papers from the table
these are part of the transcripts of the trial at nuremberg
we cant get them translated fast enough
but i guess you understand german right
passes papers across to david
thats the evidence of a guy named dahlerus
hes a swede
friend of hermann goering
i want you to study it
and i want you to use it
david tries to sneeze but fails he starts to read
were going to find more stuff to feed you
well have some other suggestions
we need to build a case for the defence based not on feelings not on prejudice but on facts
he watches david read
david is engrossed
almost imperceptibly he shakes his head
a half ruined cafe with tables on the sidewalk
werner the timpanist schlee the oboist and two others seated at one of the tables drinking coffee
david carries an attache case and walks towards the cafe
he scans the people at the tables sees the musicians and approaches
david nods herr schlee timpanist herr romer cello and herr schmidt viola
they are willing to help
we have already ordered ourselves coffee
i hope you
yeah of course
the whole orchestra will vouch for him
he was always there to support us
we need names if possible with addresses because its urgent
names of musicians saved by dr
furtwangler people he helped to escape abroad
lets go somewhere public
david leaves money on the table and then walks off with the four men
they talk as they make their way down a side street
steve and dymshitz sit opposite each other and clink vodka glasses
they have been drinking but are not yet drunk
to co operation
dymshitz pours more vodka
i was in vienna
i had with me an austrian chauffeur max his name was he spent time in the camps
we were looking at these viennese cleaning up the bomb damage scavenging for rotting food butt ends anything
i said to think a million of these people came out to welcome adolf on the day he entered the city a million of em and now look at em
and max said oh not these people major
these people were all at home hiding jews in their attics
you get the point colonel
the point is theyre all full of shit
furtwanglers in a different category
were dealing with degenerates here
he is still for a moment then grabs the bottle and pours himself a drink downs it
dymshitz watches him then degenerates
german modern paintings stacked untidily
dymshitz carrying a vodka bottle and his glass shows steve the paintings
steve too has a glass
a great artist will have great privileges in a russian zone
thats why he didnt get the hell out of here when he had the chance
i put that to him he couldnt answer
why didnt he go and direct in america like that italian toscanini
dymshitz pours vodkas raises his glass drinks
so does steve
now their moods swing with the drink
dymshitz drinks then sits sinks into his own world
lost for a moment perhaps
perhaps he believed he could at least try to preserve something important things like an orchestra a school
thats his country
maybe he has an old mother who cant be left alone
maybe he has brothers sisters
a forlorn look at steve
his eyes are misty he is visibly drunk
a wry smile colonel
he had no sisters no brothers only a lot of love affairs
anyway major why should he leave his country his mother tongue his family his history his past his future just because now suddenly there is a dictatorship
before that turns rotten
what if they surround the space with barbed wire colonel
suddenly exploding dont talk about things you know nothing about
he was in a dictatorship
dismissive yeah yeah art and politics yeah yeah i heard all about that
angry in a dictatorship art belongs to the party
if you want to be a conductor you have to have an orchestra
and you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power
all over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises
this is what im saying
he must have had party contacts
there are good party members who help and there are dirty non party members who inform on you
of course they gave him privileges
and suddenly steve suddenly you notice that they like you
they honour you suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world for example
i said orchestra
another sudden change of mood to earnest intimate help me steve
you say you answer for someone from high up
i too have orders from high up
very high up
we want furtwangler
ill give you in return the whole orchestra four five conductors
i need him steve
no can do
let furtwangler go
i have a duty
i am sorry duty
duty fucking duty
trouble is you americans want everybody to live like you
we liberated berlin major steve not you
our duty also is to bring back the best of german culture
dymshitz bursts out laughing
stung steve advances on him almost as if hes about to attack him physically
he stops sways a little then after a moment drops down in a chair near to dymshitz
intimate im gonna get that fucking bandleader colonel
no fucking deal
then youre going to kill me
drunk steve is clumsily almost frantically threading film into the mm projector
he switches off the lights then stumbles back to the projector turns it on and directs its beam towards a blank square of watt
its an american military propaganda film
youll see ruins youll see flowers youll see some mighty pretty scenery dont let it fool you
you are in enemy country
the nazi party may be gone but nazi thinking nazi training and nazi trickery remain
somewhere in this germany are two million ex nazi officials
out of power but still in there and thinking thinking about next time
remember that only yesterday every business every profession was part of hitlers system
practically every german was part of the nazi network
they believed they were born to be masters
dont argue with them
you are not being sent germany as educators
youre a soldier on guard
you will observe their local laws respect their costumes and religion and you will respect their property rights
you will not be friendly
you will be aloof watchful and suspicious
steve swaying slightly watches with the film continuing
bright summers day
emmi pushing her way through the crowded market
she comes to the stall with gramophone records
david is with her staying behind a little so as not to disturb her
she starts to look through the records blowing her nose from time to time
then she finds a box of records opens it is delighted
she bargains with the stallholder and she hands over money
she shows her purchase to david happily
they struggle on in the crowd
david suddenly stops
he has spotted a tandem
the bicycle with two seats is old and rusty but seems to be in working order
david steps up to it touches it
two persons emmi and david riding the tandem
emmi in the front pedalling david behind
the road going up into the hills is full of potholes
they change seats
david is in the front emmi at the back
suddenly the road begins to descend
they change again emmi sits in the front david at the back
they speed down the hill
the tandem ridden by emmi and david rolls into a huge building black and burnt out
in the middle of the vast hall surrounded by the staircase there is a christmas tree almost burnt to cinder
emmi and david stare at it mesmerised
yesterday i read that furtwangler was asked to lead the new york philharmonic back in toscanini suggested it
had he accepted he would have become the most celebrated conductor in america
when he made his decision he couldnt have known everything
especially not the way people like you do whove returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement
because you are blameless you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness
but you have no idea how people lived here
when he met hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him was he pleased
i dont know
but you and i already know that he has saved lives
steve and david studying files in silence
furtwanglers baton is on steves desk
steve drinks black coffee
curt nods of greeting
she goes to her desk then takes the bruckner record to steve
steve looks at the record then glances up at emmi
he does his best to exclude david who tries to hear what is said
emmi glances at david
bruckners seventh major
do you know where the adagio begins
put it on ready to play and ill tell you when to play it
he returns to his desk
emmi looks through the album for the appropriate record
steve by the open window looking at his wristwatch smoking a cigarette
david and emmi both watch him
the door opens and furtwangler bursts in
it is now nine oclock precisely
i do not intend to be kept waiting again
dangerously calm dont talk to me like i was a second violinist
go back into the waiting room
miss straube will come and get you when i am ready to see you
furtwangler goes out
jesus god who the hell does he think he is
who the hell does he think he is
david and emmi gaze at him as he tries to regain control
the door to the landing is open and rode is there pretending to sweep
he looks in to see furtwangler sitting holding his handkerchief over his nose and mouth
would you perhaps like to have a glass of water herr professor
furtwangler doesnt seem to hear
rode hesitates then continues to sweep
david and emmi look at him puzzled
she goes to the door opens it nods
rode quickly disappears
furtwangler looks at emmi
what is this man doing here
emmi doesnt answer
all eyes on the door
come in come in sit down
furtwangler deeply suspicious goes for the uncomfortable chair
no no take this one its more comfortable he holds the other chair for furtwangler who sits
if its too hot open your tie
interrupting i wish to say something
go ahead be my guest
furtwangler takes from his pocket a piece of paper with notes
he blows his nose
the room is warming up
it will become like an airless court room a pressure cooker
when i last saw you i was unprepared
i did not know what to expect
in these past weeks i have been thinking more carefully and making some notes
glances at the notes
you have to understand who i am and what i am
i am a musician and i believe in music
i am an artist and i believe in art
art in general and music in particular has for me mystical powers which nurture mans spiritual needs
i must confess however to being extremely naive
i insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics
my entire life was devoted to music because and this is very important because i thought that i could through music do something practical
and what was that
maintain liberty humanity and justice
gee thats a thing of beauty honest to god a real thing of beauty
im going to try to remember that
liberty humanity and justice
but you used the word naive
are you now saying you think you were wrong
that art and politics cant be separated
i believe art and politics should be separate but that they werent kept separate i learned to my cost
and when did you first learn that when you sent the telegram
was that the surrender signal the waving of the white flag
happy birthday dear adolf love wilhelm
or words to that effect
that sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying okay adolf you win
youre the number one man
have a swell party
i have no idea what youre talking about
the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal adolf hider
i never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings
think carefully wilhelm
maybe not in your own name but as privy councillor or vice president
i dont have to think carefully
this is utterly ridiculous
david and emmi exchange the briefest of looks
david raises his hand
why not show dr
furtwangler the evidence
it may refresh his memory
you wont find it because no such telegram exists
well i tried you got to admit i tried
i thought i might just trap you there wilhelm but david here was too quick for me
smart move david smart move
no i dont have the telegram but i know it exists
and i want you to know wilhelm were going to keep looking for it because i believe you sent it
then you are wrong
art and politics yeah art and politics
lets look at that
you and the berlin philharmonic toured the third reich played in countries the nazis had conquered
are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from on wasnt a commercial for adolf and all he stood for
we never never officially represented the regime when we played abroad
we always performed as a private ensemble
as i think i already told you i was a freelance conductor
you know something
you shouldve written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than double indemnity
what do you imagine people thought
the berlin philharmonics taken over by doctor goebbels and his propaganda ministry but wilhelm is a freelance so art and politics are now entirely separate
is that what you believed ordinary people thought
have no idea what ordinary people thought
no because i had only one intention
my only intention whatever i did was to show that music means more than politics
tell me about von der null
taken off guard von der null
yes von der null
von der null
how longs this going to go on wilhelm
i say von der null you say von der null i say von der null you say von der null we could go on all day
you know who von der null is dont you
edwin von der nuell music critic
yes i know who he is
isnt it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy von karajan called him a goddamn miracle said he was a better conductor than you
then you had von der null conscripted into the army and no ones heard from him since
thats an outrageous lie
you sure you didnt call one of your close buddies and say god in heaven did you see what that guy von der null wrote about me
the greatest conductor on earth
i want him out the way
he had the nerve to accuse me i am not playing enough modern music
send him to stalingrad
isnt that what you did
you dont like criticism do you wilhelm
you surely didnt like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you
are you saying the name von der null was never mentioned in your talks with goebbels
once he said hed read what this man wrote about me
and what did he say
he said dont mind him
his job is to criticise your job is to conduct
and what happened to von der nul
i have no idea
youve really no idea
ill tell you what happened
he died in stalingrad
now that young conductor whats his name
playing with furtwangler that miracle kid you know who i mean
but you called him something else
what did you call von karajan
ill say it then
is that right
you couldnt even bear to say his name
furtwangler rises angrily and starts to pace
please stop playing these games with me
why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding
ill tell you why
you remember we talked about you playing for hitlers birthday
and you told me that goebbels got to your doctors first that you were tricked
yes thats what happened
he sits heavily wipes his brow
he is sweating now
i have a different story to tell
i dont think you were tricked
not in the way you describe
i believe something else happened
ive seen the hinkel archive ive seen records of phone calls and putting it all together this is what i think happened
i think goebbels said wilhelm if you wont conduct for adolfs birthday well get the miracle kid the guy that critic von der null thinks is the greatest conductor in
hes not just willing to conduct for adolf hes offered to sing happy birthday as a solo
come on admit it
k worried you didnt he
he always worried you
in hes thirty four years old youre already fifty six
and goebbels and goering keep saying to you if you dont do it little k will
never mind art and politics and symbols and airy fairy bullshit about liberty humanity and justice because i dont care how great you are
its the oldest story in the book a wry look at david the ageing romeo jealous of the young buck
the real reason you didnt leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that once you were out of the way youd be supplanted
by the miracle kid the partys boy twice over flashy talented little k
this is absolute nonsense
well im just beginning to develop my theme
isnt that what you call it in classical music developing your theme
okay so they played on your insecurity
thats human understandable
but there is one guy who doesnt like little k as much as he likes you yeah the number one man your old pal adolf
he thinks youre the greatest and when he says i want wilhelm for my birthday boy they better go out get wilhelm
so josef calls and threatens you with little k
and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna ill give it to adolf as a birthday present in berlin
thats the trick they played they got you by the balls and they squeezed
why did you stay
why did you play for them
why were you the flag carrier for their regime
interrupting of course there was a conspiracy against me a campaign even abroad
brief silence all eyes on him
you see wilhelm im talking about ordinary everyday reasons
which is why i want to discuss your private life
how many illegitimate children do you have
major i dont see how this line of questioning could
david what are you counsel for the defence now
to furtwangler did you hear the question
barely audible i have illegitimate children
i said i have illegitimate children
i dont know how many
you like the women dont you wilhelm
isnt it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductors baton isnt that true
indicating emmi major this is deeply offensive and repugnant
and totally irrelevant
continuing to furtwangler not so counsellor
that secretary of yours she wasnt just your secretary she procured women for you didnt she
as many and as often as you wanted
stop this please stop this now
no im not going to stop it
hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter
i absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter
but you see what im getting at
you get a gorgeous house youre highly paid
what are you gonna do stay or leave
one voice comes back at me stay
major thats not a good argument
furtwangler did indeed enjoy all these
these privileges he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is
thats true of any leading artist in any country in the world
but it still doesnt make them saints
they still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night dont they
they can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me
well just like me
to furtwangler okay wilhelm go home now
go home and think about these past twelve years
i dont understand what you mean
no thats your problem wilhelm
you understand nothing
well call you
steve goes to his desk and as furtwangler rises uncertainly what
why dont you go downstairs get a cup of coffee and calm down
whats the matter emmi
whats going on with you
im sorry but i have to leave
ill find other work
youll have to get someone else thats all
what is this emmi
i cant do this
its not right
whats not right
i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that
just like you questioned him
i want to show you something
let me show you something and then if you want to leave you can leave please please
his friends they did this
and he gave them birthday concerts
but he had no idea a lot of people had no idea
i only realised what was really going on when i got arrested
if he had no idea why did the jews need saving
this is the question emmi to all germans why did the jews need saving in this country
why if people had no idea
i would like to go now please
but steve turns on the projector and the bergen belsen film flickers into life
david and steve at the bar each with a drink in front of them lost in their own thoughts
then steve signs to the barkeeper to fill their glasses but david puts a hand over his glass
then can i ask you a favour major
when you question him again could you treat him with more respect
with more what
major he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect
flaring hissing david i dont understand a thing about you
youre a jew
are you a jew
yes im a jew
but i like to think first im a human being
a human being oh good im relieved i thought you were going to say you were a music lover
this man this great artist has made anti semitic remarks like you wouldnt believe
i got letters
major show me someone who hasnt made an anti semitic remark and ill show you the gates of paradise
over reacting and overlapping what is it with you david
where are your feelings
wheres your hatred your disgust
wheres your fucking outrage david
he starts to go then comes back to them
think of your parents david and then think of him conducting happy birthday dear adolf
i mean for chrissake whose side are you on
just grow the fuck up
the customers stare at him as he stalks out
the band plays
david and emmi sitting
i want you to come back to the office
may i come in
if you are there you can influence what happens
what good can you do by leaving
if you go you are giving up and how can you help furtwangler or me
dont think about leaving
hot windows closed
david and emmi present
steve looks up from his notes
everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the jews
but holds up a sheaf of papers
i have things here you said and wrote
listen to this the jew composer schonberg is admired by the jewish international
and what about this jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music
jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples lacking roots
you deny you said these things
those attitudes do not exist in me
i believe that
but just answer the question dont give me explanations
speaking to party members i used their language of course i did everyone did
with some irony major sorry to interrupt but maybe we have to
maybe we have to balance those things against his assistance to his jewish colleagues
this is a transcript of the proceedings at nuremberg
a swedish businessman birger dahlerus testified in cross examination that he had several meetings with hermann goering
i first saw goering dahlerus testified embroiled in a stormy interview with wilhelm furtwangler the famous conductor of the berlin philharmonic who was vainly seeking permission to keep his jewish
holds up his package of letters and dumps them on emmis desk
emmi pick one of these any one read it out loud
emmi is uncertain
steve shrugs indifferently
she picks an envelope and takes out the letter
reading please remember that dr
furtwangler risked his life to help anyone who asked him
i personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help
he never turned anyone away
after he heard me play
i am a violinist
he gave me money because i was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to sweden
he helped countless people in similar ways
and this only one of these letters major
i have lots of them
smiling how many times have i got to tell you i was in insurance
you think i cant smell a phoney policy when its shoved under my nose
sure he helped jews but that was just insurance his cover because all the while he was maestro of all he surveyed turning on furtwangler see wilhelm i think youre
their boy their creature
you were like an advertising slogan for them this is what we produce the greatest conductor in the world
and you went along with it
the truth of the matter is wilhelm you didnt need to be a member of the party
i made a mistake when i asked you for your party number
i shouldve asked you for your non party number
just like some other well known artists
suddenly to emmi emmi put that record on
emmi puts on the record of the adagio from bruckners seventh symphony
after a moment do you know what that is
of course i know what that is
okay so what is it
you know the last time it was played on these air waves
how can i know such a thing
ill tell you then
the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal hitler had shot himself
listen to it
did they pick little ks recording
did they pick some other conductor
no they picked you and why
because you represented them so beautifully
when the devil died they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march
you were everything to them
the music plays
near to breakdown but struggling for control i have always tried to analyse myself carefully and closely
in staying here i believed i walked a tightrope between exile and the gallows
you seem to be blaming me for not having allowed myself to be hanged
david takes the record off
i didnt directly oppose the party because i told myself that was not my job
if i had taken any active part in politics i could not have remained here
but as a musician i am more than a citizen
i am a citizen of this country in that eternal sense to which the genius of great music testifies
i know that a single performance of a great masterpiece was a stronger and more vital negation of the spirit of buchenwald and auschwitz than words
an uncontrollable surge of anger wells up in steve causing him to pace alarmingly
he grabs the baton from his desk stands trembling before furtwangler and snaps it in half
he pushes his face close to furtwangler who recoils terrified
david half stands ready to intervene physically
during this emmi puts her fingers in her ears
quiet terrifying have you ever smelled burning flesh
i smelt it four miles away
four miles away i smelt it
have you ever seen the gas chambers the crematoria
have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses
you talk to me about culture art and music
you putting that in the scales wilhelm
you setting culture art and music against the millions put to death by your pals
they had orchestras in the camps
they played beethoven wagner
the hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families
i dont understand the germans relationship with music
what do you need music for
your pals you could call to save a few jews when millions of them were being annihilated
yes i blame you for not getting hanged i blame you for your cowardice
you strutted and swaggered you fucking piece of shit king pin in a shithouse
you talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows and i say to you lies
breaking down i love my country i believe in music what was i to do
look around you
see the country you served
look at people who had real courage who took risks who risked their lives
like emmis father
he sees emmi has her fingers in her ears yells at her
emmi take your fingers out of your ears
she does so
im talking about your father
all eyes on her
my father only joined the plot when he realised that we could not win the war
she cries quietly
desperate what kind of a world do you want major
what kind of world are you going to make
do you honestly believe that the only reality is the material world so you will be left nothing nothing but feculence
more foul smelling than that which pervades your nights
near to breakdown how was i to understand how was i to know what they were capable of
no one knew
no one knew
he breaks down buries his face in his hands weeps
i dont want to stay in this country
yes i should have left in it would have been better if id left
he is suddenly overtaken by nausea and faintness stands a hand to his mouth
emmi goes to him
get him out of here
emmi helps furtwangler out
steve strides to the window opens it puts his head out into the fresh air
emmi helps furtwangler to a chair
she watches him solicitously
he breathes deeply
thank you fraulein
you have been most kind
he smiles at her
she is embarrassed
steve is trying to get a number on the telephone
david is packing up his papers
david turns to the records starts to son through until he finds what hes looking for
he removes the bruckner and puts another record on the turntable
into the telephone major arnold
get me general wallace
major arnold about furtwangler
i dont know if weve got a case thatll stand up but sure as hell we can give him a hard time
at full volume the sound of the subdued opening of beethovens ninth symphony
to david hey turn that down would you
cant you see im on the phone
into the telephone never mind we got a journalist wholl do whatever we tell him
but david ignores him sits implacable listening
furtwangler walks slowly down the stairs a broken man struggling to regain his composure
emmi watches him
the music at full blast
david at an open window keeps his back to steve still on the telephone
turn it off
furtwangler on the stairs stops hearing the music echoing through the building
furtwangler left hand begins to tremble but it is only his way of sensing the tempo
furtwangler slowly continues down the stairs
we handed wilhelm furtwangler over to the civil authorities and he was charged with serving the nazi regime with uttering anti semitic slurs performing at an official nazi party function
and with being a prussian privy councillor
furtwangler was acquitted
i didnt nail him
but i sure winged him
and i know i did the right thing
furtwangler resumed his career but he was never allowed to conduct in the united states
he died in
little k succeeded him as head of the berlin philharmonic
goebbels and other high ranking nazis in the audience
when the music finishes furtwangler turns and bows
goebbels rises and shakes hands with him
furtwangler takes his handkerchief and wipes his hands
the film replays this gesture several times furtwangler wiping his hands
