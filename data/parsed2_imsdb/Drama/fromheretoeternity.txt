written by daniel taradash second draft the quadrangle of army buildings is quiet and deserted
a broken down taxi drives in at one corner and slowly makes its way around the quadrangle
superimposed over shot is the the taxi pulls up across the street from camera
a soldier gets out pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him
he pays the driver hoists the bags to his back moves toward camera
the taxi drives away slowly
the soldier walks toward steps leading to a low building
he is prewitt called prew for short years old well built good looking
he wears an enlisted mans uniform and on the sleeves are marks where chevrons have been removed
he pauses looks up over the door
camera pans up to sign which reads orderly room g a small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs out of the screen door and into shot
he is wielding a frayed broom
this is private angelo maggio
he is violent and funny and sour and friendly
he sees prewitts legs but not his face speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch
fine way to pass the time
good for the mind
maggio turns and stares at prew astonished
i transferred out of fort shatter
maggio notices the marks on the sleeves where the stripes have been removed
prew follows his glance
you quit the bugle corps
maggio jerks his head toward the sign
thats what the orders say
you made a bad mistake
this outfit they can give back to custer
prew smiles slightly starts toward door
the captain aint in yet
prew puts down his barracks bags
ill look around
smiles for first time maybe we borrow some money from a twenty per cent man and take a real trip to town some night
prew walks slowly down the raised porch alongside the street
he takes the mouthpiece of a bugle from his pocket jiggles it idly a habit of his
he comes to the dayroom glances through the screen door goes in
the dayroom has a pool table ping pong table a radio etc
moth eaten upholstered chairs line both walls
the place is empty as prew enters
he looks around casually sees the pool table in an alcove
he moves over to it puts the bugle mouthpiece in his pocket picks a cue from the rack on the wall
he switches on the light chalks the cue
the triangle of balls is already racked on the table
prew addresses the cue ball shoots and breaks the rack solidly
he watches the balls hurry around the table
whatre you think youre doing
why aint you out in the field with the compny
whats your name
the voice is brawling brash vigorous
prew turns slowly
camera angle widens to include first sergeant milton warden almost at prews elbow
he is thirty four big and powerful has a neatly trimmed moustache
transfer from shafter
i heard about you
i heard about you too warden
well put up that cue and come along
this heres a rifle outfit prewitt
you aint suppose to enjoy yourself before sundown
the mans very particlar about little things like that
warden goes out of the dayroom
prew puts up the cue and follows him
as prew and warden walk along the porch warden a few paces ahead
they go into the orderly room
as prew and warden enter
maggio is sweeping the room
mazzioli a bespectacled intellectual looking private first class is at the clerks desk opening it taking out papers etc
prew sits on a bench as warden goes over to mazzioli
grant went to the hospital yesterday
did you make up his sick record
did you make a note for the morning report
youre the compny clerk
the lousy sickbook is your job
those medics didnt get the sickbook back till late yesterday ill tend to it right now thanks
i already done it for you
maggio has swept his way over to prew
he stops sweeping now stares at the other man as if still incredulous
but you the beat bugler they got over at shatter
you probly the best on this whole rock
warden has turned from mazzioli and is looking at prew
prew looks back coolly answers maggio thoughtfully
maggio wags his head bends over to pick up wastepaper basket
well friend i feel for you
but from my position i cant quite reach you
ten sh hut
prewitt mazzioli and maggio spring to attention
the screen door bangs and captain dana holmes enters shot
he wears cavalry boots and spurs
he is about forty unsure of himself therefore always too certain with his men
he nods pleasantly
good morning men
anything special this morning sergeant warden
ive only a few minutes
new man here sir
bring him in
holmes goes into his office
warden jerks his thumb toward the door
prewitt goes into the office
warden follows him
holmes is seated at his desk as prewitt and warden enter
a placard on it reads captain holmes
a smaller desk nearby has a placard reading st sergeant warden
warden seats himself at this desk
on the walls are framed photographs of prizefighters as well as one of a large golden trophy
on holmes desk is a small framed photograph of a very attractive blonde woman
prewitt comes to attention in front of holmes desk
sir private robert e
lee prewitt reporting to the compny commander as ordered
takes papers out of drawer glances through they sent your service record over
twenty two years of age
born in kentucky
enlisted first at fort myer virginia
re enlisted for overseas duty
prewitt i always make it a policy to talk to my new men
its important for an officer and his men to understand each other
now i have a fine smooth running outfit
holmes cannot see warden who is grinning at prewitt with unholy glee
plenty of room for advancement for a man who knows how to soldier
but hes got to show me hes got it on the ball
i dont know what youve been used to in the bugle corps but in my outfit we run it by the book
what kind of trouble were you in over there
no trouble sir
what made you transfer out then
its a personal matter air
he studies prew for a moment sees warden on the edge of his chair watching hawk like
something you wanted to ask sergeant
whv yes air
you had corprals stripes in the bugle corps prewitt
you took a bust to buck private to transfer to an infantry compny
because you like to hike
i dint have no trouble if thats what you mean
or was it just because you couldnt stand to bugle
it was a personal matter
thats up to the compny commanders discretion to decide
looks straight at warden all right
i was first bugler at shafter for two years
the topkick had a friend who transferred in from the states
next day he made him first bugler over me
and you asked out on account of that
maybe i just aint sensible
but thats the reason
his feelings were hurt
kids they send us now
warden swings his chair around absorbs himself in work at his desk as if the prew situation is too absurd to concern himself with
holmes speaks blandly winningly
ive got a mighty sour company bugler here
but i suppose you wouldnt want that job
well well get your stripes back for you maybe an extra one for good measure
you know why you were sent over here when you requested transfer
i pulled a few strings
im the regimental boxing coach prewitt
i saw your fight with connors in the bowl year before last
with any luck you should have won it
i thought for a while in the second round you were going to knock him out
thank you sir
my regiment got beaten last year in the finals as you know
but i mean to win this year
and i will
all ive needed was a top middleweight
waves at pictures next year ill hang your picture up there with the others my boy
im sorry air
but i quit fighting
i just stopped sir
after maybe you heard about what happened
you mean that fallow you hurt the one that went blind
prews lips are drawn tight
he nods almost imperceptibly
during this shot maggio can be seen in b
through door to orderly room
he pretends to be sweeping but stops now and then to listen
yes its too bad about that
i can understand how you feel
but those things happen in this game
a man has got to accept that possibility when he fights
thats why i decided i would quit sir
but on the other hand look at
it this way
what if all fighters felt like that
would you have us disband our fighting program because one man got hurt
i dint say you might as well say stop war because one man got killed
our fighting program is the best morale builder we have off here away from home
i dont want it disbanded sir
but i dont see why any man should fight unless he wants to
it looks to me like youre trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf prewitt
you should know that in the army its not the individual that counts
if a man wants to get ahead he has certain responsibilities to fulfill that go beyond the regulations
it might look as though i were a free agent but im not
holmes waits hopefully for a moment then realizes prew is not going to respond further
prew snaps to attention
maybe youll change your mind
in the meantime just dont make any mistakes in my outfit
ive got to go into town
is there anything else for me today sergeant
holds up papers yea sir
the compny pond reports got to be made out
its due you make it out
is that all
holds up more papers no sir
well whatever it is you fix it
if theres anything that has to go in this afternoon sign my name
i wont be back
he goes out crossing wardens desk and knocking a wire basket filled with papers on the floor
in a moment the sound of the screen door slamming is heard
warden picks up the papers
hed strangle on his own spit if i werent here to swab out his throat for him
ill show you the supply room
warden goes out to orderly room prew following
as prew and warden enter and walk through
maggio bobs his head approvingly at prew
as they come out of the orderly room
prew hoists his barracks bags to his shoulders balancing them delicately
camera trucks with him and warden as they walk down the porch
one of his unexpected know what you did just now
when you turned down dynanite holmes boxing squad
you put your head in a noose
things are soft for a boxer in his compny
otherwise you better know how to soljer
i can soljer with any man
this aint the bugle corps this is straight duty
ill take my chances
a convertible top down drives by and pulls up outside the orderly room
karen holmes a tall lean blonde woman gets out
her skirt hikes up a little as she goes up the stairs to the orderly room
warden and prew stop walking and watch her
karen stops glances at warden momentarily then goes into the orderly room
since when is this place gettin to be the royal hawaiian
they resume walking
youll fight prewitt
youll fight because captain holmes got a bee in his hat he needs a winnin team to make mayor
and if you dont do it for him youll do it for me
i only been in this outfit eight months myself but i learned one thing
my job is to keep him happy
the more hes happy the less he bothers me and the better i run his compny
so we know where we stand dont we kid
i know where i stand
i dont believe thats the only way a man can get along
a mans got to make up his own mind and go his own way
it he dont hes nothin
maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way
but not in our time kid
today you got to play ball
you got to divide it all by two
they have reached a dutch door top half open
a sign over it reads supply room
supply sergeant leva is eating a candy bar with one hand and leisurely typing up a form with the other
he is a foolish looking man about thirty five
cant i once walk by this supply room and find you workin with both hands
comes up to door i cant do no better on what you people pay me
draw some supplies for this man
thats g compny barracks over there
get rid of your bags and come back here and levall find you a cart to lug your stuff over in
save you makin four five trips
surprised pleased okay
i just hate to see energy wasted
besides youll be needin yours
prew walks off toting the barracks bags
the bang of the orderly room door is heard and lava and warden look in that direction
as she walks along porch toward them
she is at a considerable distance
karen is about thirty
she wears a
sweater and skirt
she is aware the men are studying her
leva leans over the counter
her and them sweaters
as she continues toward them
as much as a man can make out she is probably not wearing a brassiere
wardens and lavas voices loud at first get softer and softer the nearer karen gets to camera
at end of the shot as she is only a few yards away they are practically whispering
theyre cold they got no more warmth than a diamond
theres no pleasure in them
yeah but this one knows the score
like i been tellin you
is that right
okay not around here
but i was back at fort bliss with holmes
when they was married only a year or two
i heard plenty about the lady then
okay never me
but a lot of them
i know some of the use she played around with dont tell me
i aint tellin you
youre tellin me
karen stops a few paces from camera
good morning sergeant
lava watches listens avidly but discreetly in b
during the dialogue karen seems irritated by warden who looks at her coolly appraisingly physically
im looking for my husband
captain holmes just went in town maam
of course he was to have left some things for me
that he was to have purchased
do you know anything about them
no maam i dont
is there anythin i can do for you
no thanks sergeant
she makes slight move to go pauses
hes been telling me quite a bit about you lately
he says youre very efficient
what is it that makes you so efficient sergeant
i couldnt help it if i was born smart maam
karen laughs suddenly loudly
i love that
well good bye sergeant
karen turns and walks back up the porch toward her car
warden and leva watch her
when she is out of earshot leva speaks
but man she sure is one aint she
ive seen better
medium shot karen in a negligee is seated at a dressing table brushing her hair steadily gracefully enjoying the sensual pleasure of it
karen is a woman of moods and tempers spontaneous quick to impulse
a car is heard pulling up in the driveway the motor stopping
karens brush strokes become faster rougher
the front door is heard opening and holmes voice calling karen
she does not answer
he seems to have had a few drinks
through the following karen continues brushing her hair
im sorry im so late
and about dinner i it doesnt matter
i got tied up with general slater
bumped into him at the officers club
what did the general have to say
success he said
success in war success in peacetime
and not a word about my promotion
there are times i think the old mans just waiting to ship me down
slumps into chair ive had a bad day all around
started right off this morning
trouble with a new man
if youd spend less time buttering generals and more time with your company maybe youd get that promotion
the company takes care of itself
or my topkick takes care of it
i went over there this morning looking for you
i had some business to attend to in town
during the afternoon
from the way you look i gather your business wasnt too successful
now what does that mean
give me credit for a few brains
how many times do i have to tell you i havent any other women before youll believe me
karen laughs sharply loudly then stops suddenly as she looks at herself in the mirror sees the repugnance in her face
she puts down the hairbrush picks up a long comb
if it were so dont you think id admit it
the way things are between us now
what right have you to always be accusing me
they are both tense now
holmes is out of the chair and pacing
karen combs her hair spasmodically
how long will it be i wonder before im allowed to live that down
after eight years how many times do i have to tell you it was an accident
that makes it all right i suppose
i didnt say that
i know what its done to you but you know i hate to talk about it
he moves over to her
how many times do i have to tell you im sorry about that
how many times that i had no way of knowing he puts his hands on her shoulders
karen shakes away rises faces him
you had a way of knowing dana
i want to go to bed
please get out of my bedroom
holmes looks at her sullenly then exits to adjoining room closing the door behind him
there is a moment of silence then a sharp snap as karen breaks the comb in two
the room is fairly well filled with soldiers
the click of pool balls is heard over shot
warden is reading a newspaper
a column heading conspicuous in shot reads japs advance in china
warden drops the paper on his lap looks toward pool table squinting thoughtfully
maggio prew and chief choate a corporal are playing pool
choate is a full choctaw indian a man of great bulk and tolerance
he speaks in a tremendously deep bass voice
table on one side is surrounded by the prizefighters of g company
they are ire galovitch an ape like bent kneed man weighing about two twenty with a widows peak almost to his eyebrows baldy dhom chunky and tough his head as
bald as an orange turp thornhill a stringy chinless mississipian henderson a tall hard texan champ wilson wiry and good looking
they are all sergeants except wilson who is a corporal
the men have been heckling prew and are watching with cold belligerence
choate bending over his cue shoots and misses
im coldern a idaho winter tonight
prew shoots makes a brilliant shot
man what i would not give to have this character in the corner poolroom in my home town id dress him up on overhalls and a straw hat and put
a grass in his teeth and i would make a whole mint of ghelt off him
choate laughs deeply
prew sizes up a new shot
wed of won last year if we had a good middleweight
you box as good as you used to over at shatter were a cinch this year
prew doesnt respond
he bends over his cue again
you aint forget the division champs get ten day furloughs did you son
you no talk now prewitt
but out in field with us you sing different song
an dont think you are tough guy
quickest way to stockade is guy
you heard him
better think it over
lissen its his right not to fight if he dont want
without bein kicked around
now we playin pool
whynt you take off
you want a busted head maggio
then keep your big nose out altogether
turns back to prew trainin season starts next week prew has been growing more and more agitated as much by an inner turmoil as by the men
his control snaps suddenly
i told you i quit fightin
an thats all she wrote you guys want to put the screws on go ahead
i can take anything you hand out
no halts barred
the five men move off file out of the dayroom
his paper still on his lap
he has been watching
he wears a faint smile of respect
prew chalks his cue hands trembling turns to maggio
i just hate to see a good man get it in the gut
you might as well get use to it kid
you probly be seein it often before you die
a few of the men are moving to and from the latrine but most of them are in their bunks
over shot the sound of a bugle blowing tattoo is heard
lights are being extinguished in various parts of the room
prew and choate are lying on adjoining bunks smoking
choates voice is almost linked to his last speech of preceding scene
oh sure we got a few bad non coms and we got dynamite holmes for a captain
but i been around twenty years in this army
they even up
warden and sergeant pete pop karelsen come through from the latrine
the latter is a grizzled crumbled dog face about fifty
take a compny
they got the best compny commander i ever saw
but their topkick he aint no warden
warden stops beside prew and karelsen moves on going in to a small room off the main squadroom
wardens big powerful body is covered only by a towel around his loins
he smiles at prew
everythin nice and comfy
ats the lull before the storm kid
he moves off goes into the room he shares with karelsen
whats the deal with him anyway
i cant figure him
the lights are almost all off and activity in the room has ended
hes a wild man
he was in the th when they seen their action in the settlement in shanghai
i heard about it down in the philippes even
he got himself a dsc and a purple heart out of it but youd never know it if i dint tell you
this next war comes wardenll be right in there standin up on the skyline trio to get himself killed but nothing will ever touch him
hell come through maddern wildern craziern ever
all i know is hes the best soljer i ever saw
the lights are all out now and the room is in darkness
carrying rifles marching at attention
prew is featured in shot a light smile of pleasure as he moves along
choate bringing up the rear is singing the regimental marching song in a wonderful basso
dhom marches on one side of the platoon galovitch on the other
dhom calls out the huts
they are in perfect unison
get in step prewitt
prew frowns slightly
he hops once changing stride realizes he is now out of step
dis a drill not picnic
get in step
prew hops again changing step
he marches along
dhoms voice commands platoon halt
prew and men around him come to halt
prew steps to the front still smiling faintly
you march like a drunk gooney bird
take this man to the track
send him round seven laps double time rifle at high port
prew running around track his rifle at high port
he wears a slightly contemptuous smile
corporal paluso sits on the grass infield watching him
kneeling over their rifles laid out on shelter halves
prew is featured in shot
his shirt is wet and he is sweating heavily as if he has just come from the run around the track
henderson stands in front of the group instructing
rifles your beat friend
in case them weapons jams in combat could mean life or death
you got to know em inside out
now i want you to strip them weapons and put it together again
holds up stop watch go
the men start taking their rifles apart as fast as they can
henderson walks around watching them
prew is efficient and brilliantly fast maggio fumbling and slow
maggio keeps looking over at prew admiring his speed
as he strips the rifle
this mechanical operation should be interesting to audiences a good man can field strip the weapon in thirty or forty seconds
prew finishes the job and camera moves to close on shelter half where all the parts are laid out
ats fair time
now lemma see you put it together
prews hands start to work over rifle parts putting them together
in prews hands assembled camera pulls back as prew stands up holding the weapon
the rest of the men are still working over their rifles maggio is staring up at prew in awe
henderson grabs the rifle from prew turns his back to him pretending to squint along barrel
looking along barrel
shot features his thumb as he flips the rear sight to one side
henderson turns around and angle widens to include prew
he throws the rifle at prew who catches it staggering back
your rear sights way off
youd be fifty feet off your target at three hundred yards
to others mockingly thats what comes when a soljer dont know how to assemble a rifle
you better get down to the track and carry it around a few times
maybe thatll teach you
running around track to sun rifle held before him
the smile is fainter but still there
the platoon is divided into teams of two
thornhill is the instructor
this is actual hand to hand training
prew wields his rifle bayonet fixed in expert thrusts
maggio is fighting in next lane
thornhill walks behind prew trips him quickly as he passes
prew falls off balance
his opponent smashes his rifle against prews knocks it to the ground
prew whirls on thornhill in protest
wide open ey prewitt
maybe seven lapsll teach you to watch yourself
maggio wielding his rifle madly yells over
hey i saw that i saw what you toiling around track together holding rifles
maggio and prew trudge wearily along the porch rifles on shoulders
their sweaty uniforms are plastered to their bodies
i use to think a shipping clerk was a dogs life
sighs shakes head what i would not give to be back in gimbels basement
as they come up to the supply room warden neat and cool is leaning on the counter
he steps aside to let them pass beams at prew
chows almost over men
better hurry up and wash
less of course youd rather go in the way you are
maggio gives warden a dirty look
prews expression is noncommittal
they carry their rifles into the supply room
leva comes up to the door as warden turns to go back to the orderly room
as he does karens convertible comes down the street
warden stops watches it
as karen drives by turning her head slightly toward warden
there is the vaguest trace of i smile
as he turns to watch the departing car
im tellin you top shes trouble
you better keep your mind off what youre thinkin
of warden still looking after the car thinking
it is a gloomy rainy day and the lights are on in the office
warden is at his desk working
holmes is buckling on his trench coat
he wears a happy smile
i wont be back in time to take retreat
winks at warden or reveille either probably
strides back and forth all work and no play sergeant
all you do is sit around sweating over this paper and that
there are other things in this world beside work
warden carries some official papers to holmes desk
bending over tying
you ought to get out more yourself warden
warden is looking directly at the picture of karen on holmes desk
ive been considering it
he turns aside as holmes straightens up
well im going
he claps warden on the back fraternally
im leaving it in your care sergeant
itll be here when you get back
holmes goes out
warden turns back to holmes desk
he is still holding the papers in one hand
he looks at karens picture picks it up with his other hand squints at it considering the chances very very carefully
standing on the open porch in the rain
he wears a gi raincoat
he is squinting at the door with the same expression he used looking at karens picture
he takes a deep breath as if he were going off a high diving board then knocks briskly
a shadow moves across the room behind the curtains
then karen opens the door
she is in shorts and a blouse
if it isnt sergeant warden
you better step inside or youll get wet
warden opens the screen door and jumps in past the water running off the eaves
as warden jumps in
he takes off his rain hat
i am wet
if youre looking for my husband he isnt here
taking the long chance and if im not looking for him
he still isnt here
if that does you any good
well im looking for him
do you know where he is
i havent the slightest idea
perhaps hes in town
i guess it was in town the way you put it wasnt it
or perhaps hes at the club
having a drink
fishes in his pocket brings out papers i got some papers its important for him to sign
ill try phoning him at the club for you
i never like to disturb a man drinking
what is it you want sergeant
i could use a drink myself right now
anyway i got a faint suspicion the captains in town
aint you going to ask me in
karen finally smiles faintly
she goes into the kitchen leaving the door open
warden follows her
the kitchen is small and undistinguished
karen takes a whisky bottle from a cabinet pours a straight stiff drink puts it on the sink
warden puts the papers down and drinks
karen sits on a high kitchen stool
youre taking an awful chance you know
my maid is liable to be home any time
no she wont
thursdays her day off
he takes off his raincoat drops it on a chair
you think of everything dont you sergeant
in my position you have to
goes to sink picks up are these really important
but not important they get signed today
karen suddenly deliberately rips the papers in half
then she tears them into bits and throws them into the wastebasket
warden appreciates the gesture relaxes for the first time
he grins widely
i got carbons of those back at the office
so it wont be much work to fix them up
wardens control has begun to affect karens now
she is losing her poise
thats what i like about you sergeant
you have confidence
its also what i dislike about you
its not confidence
how did you acquire such an old fashioned virtue
i figgered out one day it was the shortest distance between two points
well hes clever as well as virile
no its just that i hate to see a beautiful woman goin all to waste
he moves close to karen is on the verge of embracing her
greatly tempted but greatly disturbed she turns away
during next she pours herself a drink the bottle shaking in her hand
her tone is no longer brittle
it is bitter
waste did you say
now thats a subject i might tell you something about
and then theres waste
positive and negative
the negative is sometimes more interesting
for example what about the house without a child
tell me your thoughts sergeant
youre going to cry
not if i can help it
please dont cry
i cant stand to see somebody cry
karen turns to face him as he picks up his raincoat is about to put it on
what are you doing
isnt that what you want
i dont know sergeant
to be honest i dont know
they stare squarely at each other both puzzled and a little afraid of their emotions
this is something neither had counted on
i know a beach near diamond head
nobody ever goes there
the cars on the highway pass above and they never know its there
you feel like you used to feel when you were a kid hiding by yourself in a cave watching the others hunting you
karen turns goes to the sink puts the whisky bottle back in the cabinet
how about payday
karen is trying hard to regain her glassy composure
she is unsmiling again
you dont have to spend money on me sergeant
i just like to have some on me when i take out a woman
can you get away
warden grins as he puts on his raincoat
he goes to the door to the pantry pauses there
ill be in kuhio park
say nine oclock
karen leans back against the sink watches him go out to the pantry
a moment later the sound of the door is heard as he leaves the house
she turns on the faucet starts to rinse the glasses they have used
suddenly she turns the faucet on full force watches it pound into the sink
the men are grouped around holmes
he is pressing hard to pretend equanimity
the sergeants appear somewhat baffled but determined
this man prewitts been here over a month now
i expected you mend have him around before this
weve been runnin him pretty hard
but he dont faze
maybe he needs a good dose of the treatment
the men react to the phrase the treatment is obviously reserved for very special intractable cases
they consider it silently for a moment or two
a double dose needs him to be given
the treatmentll bring that puppy boy around
i dont want any rough stuff
but we all know good athletes make good leaders
and good leaders the music of the forthcoming montage drowns holmes words as he continues
the montage consists of a continuous stream of superimposures depicting prews growing humiliation and exhaustion at the hands of the non corns
mingling with the background shots are various angles of closeups of prew
as the speed of the sequence increases the stubborn smile on his face gives way to hurt bitterness anger
over shots we occasionally hear stray shouts of the non corns as they belabor prew but for the most part these and other dialogue are obliterated by music
the montage can be selected and created from the in all of which prew excels
riding prew mocking him grinning at him thumbing him to the track etc
featured is galovitch who takes particular joy in baiting prew
running around track staggering despite a tremendous effort not to show his fatigue
with the platoon going through crouched low live ammunition spattering around them
prew nearest camera is lower than any man in the line
over shot we hear a snatch of wilsons voice yelling at prew to get lower
wilson bawling prew out thumbing him to one side of obstacle course
chinning himself on bar setup near obstacle course he is near physical exhaustion
going through alone on his belly in deep mud
coming head on into camera as he bellies through the mud of the obstacle course
snatch of mingled voices of non coms yelling keep it downs get that nose in the mud
prew is utterly spent
his face drops into the mud which splatters up obscuring the screen
bent over the sink scraping washing and rinsing cooking pans and mixing basins
he hangs the soap bucket on the hot faucet and turns it on full force
as he does private willard a fat whining cook dumps an additional huge pile of pans before him
prew looks at them ruefully
willard says something to him with a hustle up gesture
the faucet drowns the words
men are working in the steady helpless motion of the kp
waiters swing in and out of the entrances leading to the mess halls carrying large trays
the mesa sergeant a tall gaunt man surveys the scene possessively
maggio dining room orderly today wearing a soiled white coat flashes by to the mess hall almost dropping his loaded tray in his haste
a slow lazy heavy man peeling potatoes
there is a large kettle filled with dirty water in front of him in which the potatoes are floating
treadwell stabs at one with a long fork misses it
he stabs again almost in slow motion misses again
he sees stark glowering over him
ah m suppose to be a automatic rifle man not a spud cutter
rifle man huh
all somebodyd have to do would be holler war at you and itd be over the hill and far away
stark walks off
they just give me my chance theyll see
he is surprised and pleased as he spears a potato this time
he raises it triumphantly like a caught fish
the faucet is still on and we cannot hear what willard says as he dumps more pans before prew
however he is obviously complaining that prew is slow
prew sweating and angry barks something back at him and turns the faucet off
no cook ever used that many panel not even for an officers banquet ladies invited
want me to grow couple more arms
stark always alert to trouble comes into shot
willard sees him and speaks with whining dignity for starks benefit
all i ask is that you keep the pans washed up so theyre clean when i need them
in order that i am allowed to cook the kind of food required for men who work hard all day and who need good nourishing food to get their nourishment
hole up at noise
this mans hot as a forty five shootin downhill
how you think i can do my job if the mess sergeant takes sides with a goldbricking kp
what do you think i am
i think youre a fat cook who cant cook
as willard retires maggio pours through from the mass hall
screaming joyously he shoves two empty platters in front of him
me and my table waiters
we workin our tail off
they runnin us to death
comin through hot stuff one side
nobody pays any attention but prew who smiles at him
maggio winks back
bettern being threwn in jail aint it
maggio passes camera leaving the shot and disclosing warden who has entered from the mess hall in his wake
he carries a dish of eggs and sausage and is leaning against a pastry table
he is grinning lovingly toward prew
he strolls over to prew
he eats through following
the smile never leaves his face broadens as the scene progresses
you look awful tard kid
working over the sink
how do you like straight duty
life in a rifle compny eh
prew stops working turns toward warden
what makes you think i mind it
as something electric transmits itself and they all stop what they are doing to look over toward prew and warden
i didnt say you minded it kid
i just said you looked tard
drawn to a fine edge
i dont mind it top
its a great life this
i find a pearl ill cut you in
fifty fifty if you hadnt put me here i wouldnt have had no chance to find it

how you like the garbage detail
thanks top ive had it

nods as if just well then how bout street cleaning detail
you got a better memory than me
guess the best thing to do is leave you right in the kitchen a while huh
he pretends to turn away then stops turns back
course if you was an ath a leet you wouldnt have to pull kp
or any fatigue duty for that matter
not smiling now if you think you can push me into fightin warden youre wrong
not you and dynamite and the treatment
im twice the man you are
if you dint have them stripes id take you out on the green and beat you to a pulp
smile growing bigger dont let the stripes worry you kid
i can always take my shirt off
take it off right now
youd like that
you could get me a year in the stockade for that one couldnt you
closing around a heavy mug in the sink
warden looking at prews hand
wardens grin broadens with something more than sarcasm
he is impressed and pleased by prews honest anger
dont throw it prewitt
it might break on my head
and that would cost you one thin dime next payday
warden deliberately turns his back and walks off
prew looks after him
camera moves in to feature his hand on the mug
he grasps it tighter then lets it fall back into the soapy water he is blowing the bugle sounding pay call
the rays of a blinding sun flash on its shiny surface
the bugle is heard over shot
a line of spruced up men stretches through the mess hall
a blanket is spread over a table and behind it sits holmes flanked by warden and mazzioli
in front of holmes is a pile of greenbacks and a cigar box filled with silver
he is paying out the man at the head of the line
and just see you dont drink all this up in one place
the man smiles appreciating the whimsy salutes moves off
prew next in line steps up to the table
he is crisp sharp expressionless
he holds out his hands for fingernail inspection
holmes looks them over then up at the perfect knot in his tie
he stares at prew as if trying to fathom him
have you given any thought to the boxing team recently prewitt
i feel the same way sir
holmes hands clench
he seems about to fly into a rage when he senses a motion at his side
he turns to see warden looking straight at him
wardens face has the same meaningfully expressionless look as prews
holmes wilts before it turns to mazzioli
whats this mans pay
reading from payroll private prewitt thirty dollars base pay
deductions laundry insurance px checks
camera moves in to close shot of holmes hands laying money out on blanket
total due twelve dollars thirty cents
a gay noisy jamboree
soldiers mostly in civilian clothes and uniformed sailors swarm down the street
taxi drivers arguing with their fares as they pull up at bars
filipinos padding in twos and threes
maggio and prew dressed in slacks and aloha shirts stand in front of what looks like a renovated residence
they give evidence of having already accomplished a little substantial drinking
the sound of loud piano playing is heard from within
a sign over the door reads new congress club soft drinks dancing recreation members only
the door opens
kipfer stands at the threshold
she is a sophisticated looking woman with upswept hair wears an evening gown with a corsage of orchids
the piano music louder with the opening of the door continues through all of the following
the pianist is hammering out i dont want to set the world on fire or a similar hit of
why its angelo maggio
he barges past her through the door
kipfer frowns and follows him
prew shrugs and goes in after her
as prew enters behind mrs
the vestibule has an old south feeling of mustiness and respectability
maggio is handing some bills to annette a young brash looking girl who sits behind a reception desk
so there yare
dues all paid up
who ya got playin the piana a hippo
angelo i dont believe ive met your friend
and you know how i hate to find you boys in this condition
any time women see a soldier think hes drunk
you know why
because he is
heavy drinking simply doesnt mix with the entertainment business
every respectable place must consider its future
kipfer maam i give you my solemn word your future will be safe with us
maggio nods vigorously in agreement then pushes through the heavy curtains which separate the vestibule from the room beyond
kipfer looks after him a little unhappily
angelo is one of my favorites
annette dear take care of this gentleman will you please
kipfer exits through the curtains
annette takes a card from file picks up pen
itll be eight bucks babyface
four for initiation fee four for april dues
say what do i get for it
rattling it off members are entitled to all privileges of the club which includes dancing snack bar soft drink bar and gentlemanly relaxation with the opposite gender so long as
they are gentlemen and no hard liquor is permitted
takes a breath got it
prew grins digs in his pocket for money
i got it
several rooms branch off from this main one
there are about a dozen soldiers in civilian clothes and about a dozen hostesses
several couples are dancing
the man at the piano is banging away his music clashing cacophonically with a jukebox record from an adjoining room
camera pans as mrs
kipfer moves to and fro encouraging the men to enjoy themselves
the new congress is a sort of primitive u
a place of well worn merriment
it is not a house of prostitution but the girls look available for goosing
all but one we see at the end of the pan
she sits alone on a couch
this is lorene
there is an innocent child like look about her
her hair is done demurely in a circular roll low on her neck
she is about twenty four
she is reading a
magazine untouched by the din around her
pounding the piano as if he is trying to knock the keys out
he has an enormous head and a hogshead chest
he resembles porky pig
his dead eyes look like two beads of caviar spaced far apart on a great white plate
maggio is attempting some serious dancing with sandra a very tall girl
fatsos furious tempo and tune keep drowning the langorous tango coming from the jukebox
maggio keeps switching his style as he tries to get out of the range of the piano but cannot
he is very annoyed
he and sandra dance out of shot as prew and annette enter from the vestibule
camera pans them to a trio of girls on a couch
girls heres some new poison
this is billy and jean and nancy
the girls smile ad lib hellos
prew is looking over the girls heads at someone in rear of room out of shot
as if she senses someone is staring at her she looks up from the magazine smiles serenely across the room
as she reacts sourly to prews reaction to lorene
he seems transfixed
dont tell me the princess is your style
annette takes his arm moves him toward two quite good looking girls talking to a soldier
meet suzanne and roxanne
the girls greet him heartily but prew is looking back over his shoulder at lorene
annette plucks his sleeve with haughty disdain
much as i adore your company you must allow me to tear myself away
i see a few friends at the door
also i can see i will be of no use to you much
she walks off
the other girls resume talking to the soldier
prew continues to gaze across the room
her head tilts up slowly as if someone is coming toward her
prew comes into shot and stands before her tongue tied
she pats the couch
her voice is low pitched poised
would you like to sit down
enchanted by the name lorene
i havent seen you in here before
prew gestures with the membership card
i dint know about this place till now
a friend of mine brought me
were stationed at schofield
somehow i didnt think you were a soldier
bridles a bit well i am
and im in for the whole ride
im a thirty year man
i suppose its different when a fellow is going to make a career of it
there aint anythin wrong with a soljer that aint wrong with everyone else
lorene smiles her fatal smile at prews seriousness
i like you just the same
i liked you the minute i saw annette bringing you in
i mean when i came in
i saw you over here there is a commotion across the room
a group of man and girls are surrounding the piano
fatso has stopped playing and a shouting argument is going on between him and maggio
prew looks over concerned
ill play loud as i want ya little wop
a babble of voices drowns out maggios reply
friend of mine
you wait right here for me will ya
where two men are holding fatso and three girls are restraining maggio
the others are amused by the quarrel but fatso and maggio are deadly serious
mess with me fatstuff ill pull you apart
youre the kind of character i eat for breakfast ya little maggio breaks away from the girls and rushes toward patso but prew stepping through the group grabs him
kipfer bustles into the melee
now you gentlemen know i will not have any of this sort of thing
shut up you wop he says to me
little mussolini here tryin to tell me what way to play the piano
yeah my ear drums fit to bust already with that noise
you man can simply leave if youre not going to behave yourselves
come on angelo come on ony my friends can call me wop where prew hauls maggio away from the piano
has been watching you know who that guy is buddy
sure i know who he is
whadda i care
who is he
sergeant of the guard at the post stockade
settling down at the piano again
he glances over in direction of maggio with a mean smile
then he starts to hammer the keys viciously
as the music starts maggio stiffens turns as if to go back
prew holds tight to his arm
im tellin you leave him be
i seen him nearly murder a guy once
he likes it
sandra comes over disengages prews arm from maggios puts her own around him
all right bully boy now you won the war lets dance
beginning to quiet down first i got to calm my nerves
come on with me to a phone booth or some thin
slaps himself on belly where i will unveil this fifth of whisky i got under this loose flowing sports shirt
he and sandra start off toward an adjoining room
prew smiles turns back toward lorene
the smile fades
lorene is looking at another soldier on the couch beside her with her rapt innocent expression
as he crosses room to lorene hurt and disappointed
camera holds on medium shot as he comes up to her and the soldier a talkative man named bill
you go along as fast as forty miles per through that surf and your balance has got to be letter perfect
hey i thought you were gonna wait
looks up smiles bill here was telling me about surfboarding
sit down and just listen
he describes it thrillingly
prew sits down disgruntled
bill notes his expression
you know anything about surfboarding
not a thing
you must be stationed inland then
im at derussey so i get lots of chances
but then we got mountains
you know anything about mountain climbing
a little bit
are you a mountain climber
you know anything about flying an airplane
lorene is frowning now
ive had a few lessons
well i cant fly either
what do you know about deep sea diving
do you want to move into another room bill
the air in here seems to have gotten very smelly hasnt it
yeah i noticed that too listen fellow shall we go then
she and bill rise
she smiles tremulously at him as she takes his arm and they start off
she throws a severe glance over her shoulder at prew
he settles lower in the couch the picture of frustration and hopelessness
he pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it
karen sits on the bench her ankles crosses primly very ill at ease
there is payday activity here also amorous strolling couples men in ones and twos looking for pickups
several unattached men pass karen ogle her
she is about to get up and leave when warden comes into shot stands over her
his civilian suit is neat and well cut
both are strained awkward antagonistic
now that the step has been taken they are not at all sure it was a clever one
i didnt think you were coming
im not late
no i guess youre not
but then i came a little early
i must have been overanxious
you werent overanxious though were you
you got here right on the dot
maybe id of been early too only i stopped to get a drink
you certainly chose a savory spot for our meeting
would you rather itd been the cocktail lounge of the royal
no but ive had five chances to be picked up in the last few minutes
sits beside her on the thats par for the course around here
well i dont care for it
i never went in much for back alley loving
you probably think im a tramp dont you
what makes you think id think that
dont try to be gallant sergeant
if you think this is a mistake come right out and say so
listen what started all this anyway
whym i shakin inside like a school kid out with teacher
whered i come up with a yen for of all things the compny commanders wife
and her actin like lady astors horse all because i only got here on time
wardens burst shatters the tension
karen breaks into laughter
after a moment warden joins in
on the other hand ive got a bathing suit under my dress
i got one in a u drive it parked around the corner
he takes her hand
they rise and walk away backs to camera
they merge with the other couples in the little park
fatsos piano music o
prew is slumped on the couch
he stubs out the cigarette which is almost burnt down
he sees someone coming toward him slowly raises his eyes
lorene comes into shot looks down at him
hows the surfboard rider
that was a terrible way to have acted
what you did
i was jealous
youre a funny one
what do you dames want
to take the heart out of a man and tie it up in barbed wire
angry because she really now look here what do you think mrs
kipfer pays us for
were hired to be nice to all the boys
theyre all alike
is it so important
yes its important
maybe we seem all alike but none of us is ever all alike
all right im sorry about before
touched by his outburst that piano is about to drive me out of my mind
lets go up to mrs
kipfers suite and sit there
she lets us use it sometimes
for somebody special
are you mad
no im not mad
because if youre still mad id just rather we called the whole thing off
takes his arm you certainly are a funny one
they walk away from camera merging with the others in the room
sweeping over camera spray flying
a tiny beach set among rocks
the pale sand glows in the moonlight
warden in a bathing suit is lighting a fire about ten yards from the waters edge
karen is just stepping out of her dress her bathing suit is underneath
a couple of gi blankets near the fire
her teeth are beginning to chatter in the chill of the night air she raises her arms to the sky longingly happily
i hope the oceans ice cold
i hope i freeze in a solid chunk
sudden intense laugh just so longs you melt afterwards
i love the way you laugh
he stands moves to her
she laughs turns and runs into the water
he runs after her
near shore as karen dives into it
warden follows her
the wave washes over them
camera angled so we see only back of the divan
we hear soft chuckles from prew and lorene o
then silence for several moments
camera moves as we hear a few more low intimate laughs then prew and lorene are disclosed on the couch their heads close together as if they have just kissed
pleasantly but not passionately
kipfers living room is on the order of the vestibule it too has a faded lavender feeling
a door leading to another room is half open in b
a door leading to a hall is closed
prews arm is around lorenes shoulder he is very relaxed regards her with something like wonder
lorene is mellower too making no effort now to be the princess
she speaks as if resuming a conversation
i enlisted too
i came out here on my own
to get away from my home town
i had a boy friend
i was a waitress
he was from the richest family in town
he just married the girl suitable for his position
after three years of going around with me
its a pretty story isnt it
maybe they could make a movie of it
ten thousand of them
so i left and went to seattle as a waitress
and i met a girl just back from hawaii
she said shed made a lot of money working for mrs
i caught the first boat
ive been here a year and two months
you like it much
oh i dont like it
but i dont mind it
anyway i wont be here forever
i mean why should you
i have it all figured out
in another year ill be back home with a pile of bills big enough to choke a steer
and then i will be all set for life there is a sound at the door and they turn towards it
as it opens slowly and a disembodied arm pokes through its hand gripping the neck of a whisky bottle
after a moment maggios head follows the arm through the door
he is grinning like an amateur conspirator
i dint hear no sounds of combat
so i figgered maybe youd like a drink
as maggio comes into the room
or otherwise old sandra would of drank it all by herself
shes a fine girl
but she drinks like a fish
there are glasses on a cupboard near the divan
maggio sets three of them up starts to pour whisky into them
i never drink much
maggio stops short of the third glass
he takes a big gulp from the first
i think it a a weakness
i grant you that
and i dont like weakness
i dont like weakness
rises takes a drink but i like to drink
he comes back to the divan
with you its not a weakness
with you its more like a virtue
that sounds like a very profound remark
maybe thats why i dont get it
snuggles to prew well its so
what you gonna do marry this guy
way you grinnin at him you look like his wife
get outa here
picks up bottle okay
back to old long legged sandra
i love em tall
acres and acres
he goes out closing door behind him
suddenly the door opens again and maggio pops back in
he puts the whisky bottle on a table next to the door
enjoy yourself pizon
you need it more than me
you be back with the treatment tomorrow
he pops out again the door closing after him
prews gaiety dims with the reference to the treatment
lorene sees this
prew rises goes to whisky bottle
that was nice before
the way you snuggled up
in front of him
whats he mean the treatment
prew doesnt answer
he pours a drink gulps it
what did he mean
some of the guys puttin me over the jumps because i wont fight
on the boxing team
i dont want to fight
i dont want to talk about it
i dont want to think about it
and they make me think about it
he drops down on the divan beside her
its a personal thing
his dread of telling the tale crumbles before his overwhelming need to tell it to have someone understand
over at port shafter
i used to fight
i was pretty good
i used to work out with dixie wells
he was a light heavy but he was fast
he loved boxing
he was gonna come out of the army and go right into the upper brackets
people on the outside had their eye on him
rises paces dixie didnt want to use the six ounce gloves this time
and we neither of us wore headgear anyway
i was set flat on my feet when i caught dixie wide with this no more than ordinary solid cross
dixie just happened to be standing solid too
sits on chair from the way he fell i knew
dead weight square on his face
he dint roll over
he was in a coma a week
then he finally came out of it
the only thing was that he was blind
rises paces i went up to the hospital to see him
then i couldnt go back
we got to talking about fighting the second time
and dixie cried
seein tears comin out of those eyes that couldnt see
there are tears on prews face
he turns away from lorene
lorene very moved goes to him stands behind him puts her hand on his shoulder
prew does not turn but his hand grasps hers
camera moves to close shot of the hands
a wave sweeps by camera karen and warden riding it into shore
camera pans with them as they walk out of the water hand in hand
they stop at edge as if by a mutual impulse
he swings her to him and kisses her
as they kiss
the embrace is impassioned
when their lips separate their arms remain around each other holding tight to something they find is more than sex alone
as karen and warden kiss again a tenderness in him not seen before and which he normally takes great pains to hide
as their lips separate again
nobody ever kissed me that way
they are both disquieted by the quality of their reactions to the kisses
the jump to banter is a quick defense
camera moves with them as they walk to the fire
karen smiles at him
not even one
out of all the many men youve been kissed by
well that will take some figuring
how many men do you think thereve been
camera holds as they sit beside the fire
karen wraps one of the blankets around her
i wouldnt know
cant you even make me a rough estimate
not without an adding machine
do you have your adding machine with you
no i forgot to bring it
then i guess you wont find out will you
maybe i already know
the defense has given way and there is no mirth in the questions and answers now
whats the matter
what are you hinting at
is there something to hint at
i dont know
maybe a lot
or maybe you just think theres a lot
maybe i do
maybe theres been a long line of beach parties
you must be crazy
listen baby maybe not here
but what about when you and holmes were at fort bliss
karen flings off the blankets snatches her dress stands up raging
she speaks as she pulls the dress over her head wriggles into it
i had to go and forget you were a man with the same rotten filthy mind the rest of them have
for a minute i had to convince myself you were different only its true aint it
yes its true
a part of it some small part of whatever sewage youve been listening to
some day perhaps youll get all the story
all what story
youre getting to sound so much like a typical male
so you just sweat it out like a typical male
she starts toward the rocks at the end of the beach walking fast then almost running
warden runs after her
as warden catches up with karen
he grasps her arm roughly hauls her down onto the sand
he stares at her bitterly waiting f or her to speak
ive never told it to anyone before
but i think now is the time
ill tell you the whole bloody messy thing
you can take it back to the barracks with you
she speaks rapidly pouring it out in bursts
for much of the story her face is in shadow as if a cloud is passing across the moon
id been married to captain dana e
holmes two years
only he was a first lieutenant then
back at fort bliss
we lived right on a little lake where we could fish and swim and be alone our dream cottage
im sure you must be able to picture it
it was off on a back road four miles from the highway
two miles from a neighbor and a telephone
pauses then rushes on i hadnt been married long when i knew my husband was stepping out on me
but you get used to that
your mother tells you that its life that i t happens to a lot of women
of course she doesnt tell you until after it happens
reacting with fury toward holmes compassion for karen
then by that time youre pregnant
and at least youve something else to hope for
i think i was almost happy that night the pains began
even though they were weeks too early a whole month too early
i remember dana was putting on that dapper silk gabardine uniform he used to wear
he was going to an officers seminar
he was kidding me about false labor
i didnt think it was humorous
i told him to get home early to bring the doctor with him
he smiled tenderly and told me about the psychic reactions of women to pregnancy
but never fear hed be back early
and maybe he would have
if the seminar hadnt been with the hat check girl in one of the night clubs
he was only a little drunk when he came in
at five a
he looked alarmed when he saw me
i guess it was because of my screams
i was lying there on the floor you see no dont say anything
im not finished yet
of course the baby was dead
it was a boy
but they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine
they even took my appendix out too
they threw that in free
it was all fine
and of course one more thing no more children
do you know what that means
youre not a woman
youre not anything
youre a gutted shell
sure i went out with some of the men after that
a few months of it
id been made dirty and i wanted to be clean
you can see that cant you
anyway i got my revenge on dana
i kept on living with him
the hateful miserable you hunt so hungrily for love
love if you can find it you think might give things meaning again
listens listen to me all right
warden shakes his head inarticulate with his rage and love
karen moves closer to him
until i met you i didnt think it was possible either
over shot soft strumming guitars and two voices singing a quiet blues
there are scattered groups about fifteen men in all playing pool ping pong reading writing letters talking
camera reaches private sal anderson and friday clark playing the guitars and singing
clark plays only passably but anderson is highly accomplished effortlessly sounding off chord progressions in diminished minors
friday the bugler is about twenty four with shy trusting eyes
anderson is the same age also quiet non aggressive
camera continues panning passes a soldier reading a newspaper who shakes his head and mutters
aint it terrible about lou gehrig dyin
then moves in to hold on a group at a window seat bulling
prew is stretched out wearily looks as if hes been through another recent dose of the treatment
maggio perches in the frame of the window like an aggressive robin
treadwell slouches at the end of the seat
pete karelsen is in a chair nearby reading a magazine
ahm in the army because ah can live better on the inside than on the outside
it aint the reason im in
now hes gonna give us that snow about bein a thirty year man again
look at karelsen there
only seven years more for rockin chair money
karelsen hears his name looks over
camera at angle so we see hes reading a full page advertisement featuring a girl in a revealing negligee
he is feeling sorry for him elf
the profession wears you down though young man
down thin like a knife whats been honed and honed
all that good steel just rubbed away
he turns back sadly to study the figure of the girl
anderson peels off a flourish as he and clark end their song
man thats blues
whered you drag that one up prom
oh just stumbled on it
he strums aimlessly again
prew and treadwell come over to listen prop themselves on chairs
during following several others stroll over and a soldier writing at a desk nearby stops turns to listen
warmed by the friendliness of the music and the moment
they got truckdrivers blues
we oughta have a soljers blues
as anderson repeats a theme he has happened on
it has a haunting melody
i betcha we could make one out of what you just played
do that again
anderson repeats the melody
i could bring it down to a third line major ending
regular twelve bars blues
i bet i got two hundred blues records back home
but there aint one could touch that
and that includes saint louis
and it could be ours
the men wear pleased smiles delighted by the idea of possessing something quite rare and truly their own
prew flips his cigarette into a can
i got it
we call it the re enlistment blues
there is a chorus of approval
lookit w e could start it with the guy getting discharged
reaches over to desk hey fella can i use this
the soldier at the desk nods and prew takes his pencil and paper
he writes down the words of the song as they are composed during following
got paid out on monday
not a dog soljer no more
they gimme all that money
he stops stuck
anderson plays the melody and prew sings the words to this point
friday clark chimes in suddenly
they gimme all that money
so much my pockets is sore
prew writes furiously
more dough than i can use
re enlistment blues
anderson plays a series of chords then repeats the last two lines as the whole group joins in
more dough than i can use
re enlistment blues
raucous hammering music sweeps away the melancholy blues
on the floor of the gym dhom is punching the bag
in a corner of the raised ring ike galovitch is skipping rope
in the center of the ring thornhill and henderson are sparring
holmes hovers beside them issuing instructions in a strident voice
he is in fatigue clothes on his knees scrubbing the floor
there is an expression of stubborn hate on his face
above his head in the shot are galovitchs feet jumping the rope
of shot is wilson seated near ring
some day you get sense in your dumb head prewitt you be up here instead down there
a fine spray of spit accompanies the words and showers over prew but he keeps about his work
still makin out you like it huh
there are two water buckets near galovitch
he skips near one of them kicks it
the bucket falls on its side and dirty water spills over the ring and down onto prew
clean up dis mess prewitt
prew gets to his feet
galovitch resumes skipping rope
and look a life hurry it up
you on fatigue detail not vacation
prew climbs into the ring gets on his knees starts to swab up the canvas
he is nearly finished when galovitch accidentally kicks over the second bucket
clean up prewitt
prew suddenly stands no longer able to contain his rage
he throws his sponge and scrubbing brush on the ring floor
clean it up yourself
you heard me rub your own nose in it a while
prew starts out of the ring
holmes intercepts him
whats the matter with you prewitt
you know better than to talk back to a non commissioned officer
but i have never liked being spit at sir
even by a non commissioned officer
i think you owe sergeant galovitch an apology
i dont think i owe him no apology
in fact i think ones owed to me
sergeant galovitch take this man to the barracks and have him roll a full field pack extra shoes helmet and all and then take a bicycle and hike him up
to kole kole pass and back
and see that he hikes all the way
and when he gets back bring him to me
prew climbs out of the ring galovitch following him
par below in the shot are prew hiking and galovitch riding behind him on the bicycle
the dirt road is steep and the sun pours down steaming hot
prew is hunched under the seventy pound pack as he plods along
he is sweat soaked puffing dog weary
galovitchs bicycle is just behind him he runs the wheels up on prews heels
you not half way yet
three more miles to top
a jeep rounds a curve a couple of hundred yards above and moves down the road
it slows its speed and pulls up when it nears prew and galovitch
the jeep is driven by an enlisted man
sitting next to him is major general slater
galovitch hops off the bike and he and prew snap to attention
general slater leans out of the vehicle
he seems puzzled and interested by the odd sight of the two men
wherere you men headed
top of pass sir
this man insubordinate
the captain is teaching him lesson
whats your outfit sergeant
company g th sir
the general still frowning slightly nods
he signals his driver to move on
the jeep starts down the road
galovitch gets on his bicycle
prew starts hiking again
prew and galovitch are standing in front of the captains desk
prew is at attention the heavy pack on his back his face is drawn and tired his clothes are plastered to him
he has regained his old expressionless look
warden has swung his chair around and is surveying the scene
prew up and down half smiles
i take it youre ready to apologize to sergeant galovitch now
no sir im not
holmes face sets he jerks his head toward the window
take him back up there again galovitch
he hasnt had enough yet
nods unhappily sick of yes air
prew about faces and goes out
warden watches prew go out then looks toward holmes whose back is to him
disgust is reflected on his face
holmes slams his fist on his desk
know that kind of man
hes an againster
a bitter ender
you cant be decent to a man like that
you have to tame him like an animal
warden i want you to prepare court martial papers
insubordination and insolence to an officer
warden swings around to his own desk
he thinks for several moments tries to sound quite casual
too bad you got to lose a middleweight like that
do you see any other way of breaking him
i dont know
but even if he only gets three months hell still be in the stockade when the boxing finals come up
he looks over at holmes sees him scowling weakening
how about just giving him a good stiff compny punishment for now
holmes ponders the situation unhappily rubs his hand over his face
shakes his head as if the whole thing is too much for him
all right all right
but throw the book at him
pleased but impassive yes sir
he is trimming his moustache
im sick of it
they aint got no right to keep breakin it off in that kid
sooner later holmes is going to hound him right into the stockade
camera pulls back revealing karelsen across the room undressing tiredly achingly
warden is sharp and blustering using karelsen as an escape valve
during following he goes to his footlocker opens it takes out whisky bottle drinks
im turnin in my stripes
i mean it pete
i could transfer out tomorrow
in grade get that
to half a dozen compnys in this regmint
i could be chief of staff too except i cant stand leaving all my old buddies
karelsen is naked now except for a bath towel knotted around his middle
he slips his feet into japanese style wooden clogs starts slowly for the door
where you going little sir echo
to take my stinkin shower if the first sergeants got no objections
whered you think
to the movies in this towel
lets go over to choys for some beer and tear up all the tables and chairs
smiles moves faster okay okay
an aged chinese at least seventy five old choy has a long white beard and wears a black skull cap and an embroidered robe
he is motionless surveying the pandemonium which we hear over shot the sounds of men laughing talking and shouting blend with jukebox music blasting chattanooga choo choo
young chop old choys son passes he is thirty white aproned bustling americanized
camera pans with him disclosing the small beer house it has unpainted cement walls and a cement floor the only thing that might be called decorative is the jukebox
the place is crowded with men from schofield a raucous assemblage everyone is drinking beer and the smoke hangs in thick layers
at a table near the door sit prew maggio clark anderson treadwell and mazzioli
at a corner table behind a forest of beer bottles and cans are warden stark karelsen and chief choate
chinas the place
your moneys worth ten twelves times as much
im gunna ship over soon as my times up in this pineapple army
pinching beer off his the canal zone for me
this girl down there
she was a planters daughter see
she lived a very sheltered life
a very moral young lady milt
i took her out to a high class dinner and then dancing
it was a great shock to her to learn about life
but she took it well
she got to like me very much after that
the last time i heard it you told it different
well what did you expect
i was in a different mood then
maggio anderson and treadwell are comparing snapshots from home spreading them out on the table
mazzioli is talking to prew with great earnestness
its in regulations
youve got a right to complain
youve got a right to take your case to the inspector general
any soldier has even a plain dogface
i know it
im not complainin to nobody
they aint goin to get the satisfaction of seein me squirm
clark begins to play the bugle softly along with the jukebox music noodling an uninspired obligato
pointing to pictures believe it nor not this is one soljer whos got a family look fifteen of em
see that old man with the handlebars
maggio is my father
i guess i ought not to tell you but
warden hasnt had you on kp much lately has he
only my reglar turn
well i was working in the orderly room this afternoon and i heard the captain telling warden youre to pull kp every weekend from now on
you know what that means you can t even go into whadda they want
they done everything now they look me in a box
what else they gonna try
clark hits a sour note an the bugle
when you gonna learn to play a bugle
in overwhelming uncontrollable protest prew slaps the bugle away from clarks mouth
in one motion he wipes the mouthpiece on his sleeve raises it to his lips and blows his own wild violent obligato to the jukebox music
as prew plays on the bugles pure tone pealing through the room
everyone puts down his beer stops talking and turns toward prew
he frowns moved by the cry behind the music
as he watches and listens an exultation for his friend nakedly revealed on his face
hitting an almost impossibly high note he stops as suddenly as he has begun
he has played perhaps fifteen seconds in
he puts the bugle down on the table embarrassed now the violence gone some of the wrath unloaded
the room is quiet for several moments except for the continuing jukebox music which sounds pale and thin now
fatso judson strolls in stands at the door
some of the men see him but no one greets him
fatso threads his way between tables as the room slowly begins to return to normal and the men turn back to their beer
as fatso passes
he stops leans over andersons shoulder to look at the snapshots on the table
he points to one picture a pretty young girl of about fifteen posing hollywoodishly in a bathing suit cracks his knuckles loudly
whos that dame
he picks up the photograph stares at it whistles again
say shes a real good piece of whistle bait
id sure like to get my mitts around her
he laughs complacently at his own wit tosses the picture on the table starts to move on maggio rises picks up the heavy wooden stool hes been sitting on and
smashes it down on fatsos head with all his strength as again the laughing and shouting in the room stops abruptly
fatso reels a little with the terrible blow but does not go down
why holy i you hit met you hit me
you bet your life
and about to do it again
still blinking from the what
but what for
thats no way to fight
reaches hand to head brings away blood why you dirty yellow sneaking wop
you yellow little wop
if thats the way you want to play
with his last sentence fatso whips out a knife and snaps open the blade
the blade is at least five inches long
it glints evilly as he raises it
there is a concerted whisking intake of breath from the room
murder is clear on fat sots face
maggio holding the stool high backs up a few feet as fatso advances toward him
men sprawl away from them
hey it you want to fight fight with fists
take it outsides there is a murmur of agreement from the crowd
a couple of men are about to rise
fatso whirls toward them
im gonna cut this little wops heart out
anybody steps in here i give it to him first
side by side
old choy watches immobile his slit eyes almost closed
young choy is shaking with fright
fatso turns toward maggio who circles back around the table as the other stalks him
scared but brave shouts im gunna de brain ya fatso
one step closer an im gunna kill ya
fatso has his knife poised at his shoulder ready to strike
warden comes into shot suddenly
he brandishes a beer bottle wildly looks like an avenging spirit of authority
nobodys gunna do nothin
anybodys killin anybody around here itll be me
warden snatches another beer bottle from a table now has one in each hand
he steps between fatso and maggio
look outs here warden
this a private affair
no it aint
this mans in my compny an im responsible for him
and you aint makin two weeks extra paper work for me by killin him
nor him you
put that knife down
he smashes the neck off one of the beer bottles points the wagged edge at fatso roars put it down
fatso slowly lowers the knife to his waist but keeps it pointed towards maggio and warden
warden deliberately turns his back to fatso spits his words at maggio
you unweaned punk come on you want some killing come on
whirls on fatso come on barrelbelly
aint you comin
neither fatso nor maggio moves
with mammoth contempt killers
youll get plenty of killing all right
more than you got the stomach for
youll be in a war one of these days
when you feel that lead from a snipers rifle hit you between the eyes come and tell me how you like it
turns to maggio now put down that chair
maggio puts down the stool
warden turns to fatso
throw that knife on the floor
fatso drops the knife
it clatters on the floor
there is another audible whoosh of breath from the room
almost scared there wasnt anybody going to stop you for a minute werent you
finally lowers his voice is there any other little things you punksd like me to take care of for you
he drops the beer bottles on a nearby table strides to his own table
the room settles back still hushed
warden has broken the mood of certain death but fatso still facing maggio bites off his words with sadistic ominous venom
guys like you get to the stockade sooner later
one day you walk in there ill be waitin
ill show you a coupla things
he walks away drops into a stool at the counter
warden stands beside the table watching
he seems satisfied as fatso moves away from maggio
still standing he raises his half filled bottle of beer drinks
maggio drops onto the stool sidles it over to the table
he half whispers to prew
i made a mistake i guess but i dont see how i could of done anything else after that big stoop said a thing like that
prew leans over and picks the knife off the floor
ill tell you your mistake
you didnt hit him hard enough to put him out
i hit him hard as i could
his head must be solid ivory
warden puts down the beer bottle and stalks towards the door
maggio and prew turn to watch him pass
anyway im glad he stopped it
hes a good man you know it
as if on impulse prew rises and follows warden out
as prew carves out
choys is on a wide road across from the entrance to the post
prew looks around for warden sees him off to one side
camera moves with prew as he goes over to him
leaning against the building undergoing a delayed reaction to the fierce moment in choys
he is white faced sweating heavily
he looks as if hes going to be sick
astonished yet appreciative that under wardens confidence and control in choys there has been a human frailty
that was a near thing
prew holds out fatsos knife
warden is beginning to get control of himself he manages a weak smile
you keep it kid
keep it for a souvenir
prew puts the knife in his pocket
they stare at one another a few moments each inarticulate each wanting to express some deep emotion of respect
you aint enjoying life much are you kid
they can kill you but they cant eat you top
warden studies prew thoughtfully
prew turns to go back into choys
prew stops turns back
could you stand a weekend pass
prew stares at him for a second incredulously unable to find his voice
i thought you thought what kid
how about dynamite
leave dynamite to me
he signs most anything i put in front of him thout readies it
though prew is overjoyed he is somehow unable to say thanks warden grins broadly at him
i hear you gone dippy over some dame you met at the new congress club
he slaps prew on the shoulder roughly
whatd you say her name was
warden walks off across the street
prew stares after him
lorene is covering prew with sand and has him almost completely buried
only his face remains uncovered
he is griming up at her
she seems thoughtful
she throws a towel over his face
he chuckles under it
my names alma
the chuckle from under the towel dies
there is a sound as of strangling from under the towel
kipfer picked lorene out of a perfume ad
she thought it sounded french
lorene whisks the towel away
prews face is comic in its surprise and chagrin
note from this point on alma will be used instead of a fashionable waikiki night spot
an orchestra in b
g is playing someones rocking my dream boat
alma and prew are seated at the bar
she is dressed modestly and becomingly might well be taken as a society girl
prew is wearing a civilian suit he looks bound and choked in it
she smiles ruefully realizes her real name has rubbed off some of the enchantment
no honest i like it
almas a swell name
it was great you gettin away today
i told mrs
kipfer i was sick
but i bet she doesnt believe it theres no tellin when ill get into town next
the warden gave me a break this time
but holmes and those others they got me on the edge
i just about went off the deep end the other day
you must hate the army
hate the army
look what its doing to you
its not the army thats doing it
i love the army
well it sure doesnt love you in return
when you love something it doesnt mean they got to love you in return
yes but a person can stand just so much from something no
a man loves a thing hes gotta be grateful
pauses gropes for i left home when i was seventeen
both my folks was dead then
i bummed around
i got all sorts of jobs
i rode the rods
i landed in jails
i didnt belong nowhere
until i entered the profession
she frowns not understanding the last word
i enlisted at fort myer and i learned how to box and i learned how to play a bugle
i never had much call for the boxing but if it werent for the army id never of learned how to play a bugle
he takes the mouthpiece out of his pocket shows it to her
this is the mouthpiece i used to play a taps at arlington
alma takes the mouthpiece looks it over seems unimpressed
as if saying i was they picked me to play a taps at arlington cemetery
she still looks dubious hands the mouthpiece back
he tries desperately to communicate
you ever think how strange a tree would look to one who had never lived upon the earth
well somehow thats how i feel when i play a bugle
there is a boisterous shouting nearby
i told ya id meet ya dint i
they turn and angle widens to include maggio who has just come up to the bar
he is in uniform
prew is pleased to see him but also alarmed there is something near desperate under maggios drunkenness
howd you get a pass
i dint get no pass
i just took off
i meant to bring a girl with me but you better get your tail back to the post
maggio shakes his head violently in the negative
im out for the night
i got a bellyfull
a nail prew
a stinkin nail
im thirsty for a nail
prew gives him a cigarette
maggio hops on an empty bar stool a few places removed from prew and alma
climb up on my shoulders prew
you can see everythin from up here
medium shot at side of room two mps watching maggio attracted by his voice and behavior
maggio talks across others at the bar to prew and alma
i been in a crap game in the latrine
i win twenty bucks
how much did you lose
i lost twenty seven bucks
thats why i aint got no girl
a tray on the bar contains olives nuts and pretzels
maggio snatches up two olives shakes them in his fist beside his ear
rolls the olives out on snake eyes
prew is increasingly concerned for maggio
you like him dont you
hes such a comical little guy and yet somehow he makes me always want to cry while im laughin at him
finishing a long gulp of beer
he puts glass down on the bar hard
the royal hawaiians jist around the corner
thats where them movie stars stay
rita hayworth and joan blondell and maureen ohara
you look like a movie star lorene
yes you do
how long fore we get in the war prew
i dont know
maybe we wont get in
thas what you say
he jumps off the bar stool suddenly tears off his tie
hot in here
he throws tie on the bar the bartender starts to protest
swimming its a great night for swimmin
kicks off shoes goin swimmin with a movie star
he is unbuttoning his shirt as he abruptly dashes away people around are laughing at him again
as prew watches maggio rush out
he sees something else o
s which worries him
the two mps cross toward direction maggio has taken
they are obviously going after him
alma follows prews troubled look
you better go look out for him prew glances at her gratefully then slips off his stool
he picks up maggios tie and shoes and hurries out after him
tall pale royal palms contrast with thick dark plants and bushes
an ornamental lamppost alongside a walking path a little distance away
prew comes into shot cautiously carrying maggios tie and shoes
he moves quickly bends over
camera pans and moves in and we see it is maggios shirt and trousers which prew has discovered on the ground
he looks at them wryly picks them up moves on
prew carrying maggios clothes stops as he sees what looks like a shadow lying across the bench
is that you angelo
the shadow does not move
prew approaches the bench
maggio is stretched out on the bench seems to be sleeping blissfully
he is clothed only in his shorts
despite himself prew smiles
he shakes the reclining figure
maggio you nut
maggio mumbles without opening his eyes or moving
im sorry sir
i wont do it again
just dont lock me up sir
honest i wont
heres your clothes
he throws the clothes on maggio
opens his eyes well give em back to the indians
the indians need clothes
all they wear is g strings
boy are you drunk
maybe a movie star comes outs the hotel right now and picks us up and takes us back to the states in her private plane
and installs us in her private swimming pool prew pulls maggio off the bench and starts to drag him across the path away from the light
take it easy prew
you scrapin my tail on the sandy sidewalk
youll get worse than that scraped listen
the ominous sound of leggins brushing each other is heard not far away
prew looks off
the two mps are on the street just outside the grounds
they are still looking for maggio somewhat aimlessly now
prew whispers to maggio as he pulls him to his feet
come on before youre in trouble
maggio pushes him away
im sick of its cant a man get drunk
cant a man do nothin
cant a man put his lousy hands in his lousy pockets on a lousy street
a man gotta be hounded every minute of his life
i aint gain to take its i aint no cowards i aint yellows i aint no bums i aint no scum
come and get us
now you done it
the two mps came running onto the path spot maggio and prew about thirty yards away
maggio picks up his shoes suddenly whips away from prew and runs toward the mps
another angle near mps as they stop surprised
maggio is shouting cant a man do nothin
as he hurls first one shoe then the other directly at the mps
one mp is hit in the shoulder staggers back
maggio dashes between him and the second mp but the latter reaches out and grabs him
maggio wrenches loose but instead of running suddenly wades in arms swinging wildly
in a moment he is hanging crab like on the mans back
the first mp charges maggio
maggio grabs the second mps club and hits the first mp over the head
horrified he starts toward the fracas
medium shot maggio and mps in f
prew in b
the second mp has managed to get out from under maggio
he smashes his fist into maggios face as the latter continues to wield the club
maggio sees prew coming toward them
im handlin this
the first mp starts to intercept prew
maggio tackles him around the knees and brings him to the ground
club gone his partner on the ground the second up fishes for his pistol tugs to get it from the holster
this aint your affair
keep out of this
medium shot prew in f
mps and maggio in b
prew sees the second mp raise his pistol point it toward him
camera pans with him as he turns quickly and dives headlong into bushes nearby
camera moves with him close to ground as he knees and elbows his way along deep into the bushes
he stops breathing hard
the sound of the mps fighting with maggio can be heard the ugly sound of fists and the uglier sound of clubs smashing bone and flesh
screaming crazed come on
is that the best you can do
i bet you eat wheaties dont you
you cant even knock me out no matter maggios voice stops suddenly
camera moves to closeup of prew on the ground his face contorted
the voices of the mps are heard now panting
i wonder what was wrong with this guy
he must be same kind of madman
come on let s get him into a wagon
a convulsive sob escapes prew as his head drops in the dirt
warden is pinning some notices on a bulletin board
prew sits on the bench against the wall miserable elbows on knees chin in hand
there is a quiet tenseness in the room
warden looks over at prew turns back to the bulletin board
mazzioli gets up from his desk wanders aimlessly to a window
the screen door slams and leva enters eating a candy bar
any word on maggios court martial
its on right now
lava sits on the bench beside prew shakes his head
hell get the stockade sure
the others tense at the word stockade glare at leva as if he had no right to mention it
their fear of the place now that it is imminent even for another soldier is shown on their faces
there is a long pause
maybe he wont get it
all he did was get drunk and run wild
thats a soldiers nature
its almost his sacred duty once in a while
there is another pause
warden barks suddenly fiercely at leva
what you hangin around here for
cant a man rest himself for a min what man
i cant stand to see people restin themselves
if you aint got no work maybe i can scare you up some
mumbling leva rises and goes out
warden goes over to prew
whynt you go on over to the day room shoot a little pool
ill let you know when the word comes through
prew looks up nods rises
he is half way to the door when the phone at the clerks desk rings
mazzioli stares at the phone as if afraid to touch it
warden goes over answers
compny g first sergeant warden speaking
yes sir i will
ill have his things in order
warden puts down phone
he looks at the waiting men
he got it
prew and a group of g company men including sergeants dhom thornhill and henderson are on the steps and porch as a reconnaissance car pulls up and halts
maggio sits between the driver and another mp both armed
note these are not the same mps with whom he fought
the g company men cluster around the car ad libbing greetings kidding maggio bucking him up
even the sergeants join in this nobody likes to see a man on his way to the stockade
whos got the beer
whatever you say
as the driver gets out of the car and goes to pick up maggios stacked barracks bag on the porch
prew moves up close to maggio
im sorry angelo
its my fault
you i shoulda stopped you somehow it was all my party
dont worry about it
pronounces e as in anyhow im gunna e scape
if gimbels basement couldnt hold me neither can no lousy stockade
you heard him say shut up
smiles at the men im a prisoner
and prisoners aint allowed to talk
they allowed to breathe though
if they good that is
during last speech the driver returns dumps the barracks bag in the car and gets in
the motor starts
the men shout good byes
heartsick as he looks at maggio
as the recon pulls out and maggios last hearty shout drifts back
e scape to mexico and become a cowboy
as the reconnaissance car drives through the chain mesh gate
in the distance is the stockade a building that looks something like a country schoolhouse
music sweeps up as the gate clangs shut
maggio walking across the yard flanked by the tall mps
he looks around as if surveying the chances of escape
as the mps march maggio up to a door and gesture him to enter alone
he goes in
camera shoots from behind a man seated at a desk
prominent in shot is a wicked looking chopped off hoe handle lying on the desk
maggio enters recognizes the man
he walks up to the desk his face set in defiance
music is rising in a fearful crescendo
camera pans just enough to reveal desk sign reading sergeant of the guard
the man stands up and the music stops abruptly
revealing fatso judson as the man on his face the same murderous expression as at choys
he cracks his fingers
his eyes following a movement of fatsos hand
eyes on maggio his hand gropes on the desk
as it finds and tightens around the hoe handle
the music sweeps in abruptly
music of preceding shot segues into an ancient savage hawaiian chant which continues through following
shot covers the continuation of all the above activity
this is a native luau definitely not for tourists
shot includes long ditches heated by red hot stones and lined with layers of banana leaves containing pig chicken rock crabs fish
pots of native stew
bowls of exotic fruit
peels of raw cane
working over the food are the natives many of the men stripped to the waist the women arrayed in colorful hawaiian costumes
a group of male dancers swaying with the insistent beat of a group of old hawaiian instruments
this is far removed from the night club hula
this is a thing of swift agile angularity primitive and powerful
at end of pan camera reveals warden and karen in the group
they are the only whites in the group
her face lit by the flames
she watches the dancing breathlessly
the native instruments playing a thin weird melody
the men laugh and grin as they dance taunt and tease somebody o
they shout and laugh and squeal with delight as they watch
it is warden the dancers are teasing
several of the dancers break out of the group dance over to warden continue to prod him apparently urging him to join them
protesting joining in the laughter
suddenly he kicks off his shoes rolls his slacks up to his knees
he snatches a gardenia from the hair of a pretty hawaiian girl next to him sticks it over his ear jumps into the firelight and dances with the others
the music comes up louder and faster as the spectators and dancers roar
they are all laughing as they dance but as warden moves with them it is apparent he is as good as any of them
nodding pointing at warden their hilarious laughter fading to delighted smiles
astonished and thrilled at wardens ability
his laughter now also diminished to a happy grin as he dances
in all he dances about thirty seconds
then he breaks out of the group and runs over to karen
as the spectators and dancers shout their applause
warden comes up to karen and puts the gardenia in her hair
karen is glowing tingling
you just love to shock people dont you
where on earth did you learn to dance like that
believe it or not chicago illinois
she flings her arms around him passionately
the onlookers howl with approval and merriment
between karen and warden and camera an enormously fat hawaiian woman pours water on the stones in one of the trench ovens
a cloud of steam rises hiding them
shooting down a thousand feet into palolo valley
bonfires and smoke rising from the floor of the valley
the thinnest carry of the ancient hawaiian music
camera pans from precipice and includes prew and alma as they trudge into shot climbing up the steep cliff road
holding hands as they walk
if i dint get to see you once in a while the treatment wouldve cracked me long ago
alma fairly winded from the climb smiles but doesnt answer
we could have taken a cab
except i aint got cab fare
its just around the bend
camera holds as they walk on around a bend in the road
the small house is perched precariously on the very edge of the cliff
alma and prew come around the bend come up to the door prew marvelling at the house
this other girl and i were lucky to rent it
its a very fashionable district
she hands prew her key
as he is unlocking the door ill get an extra one made for you
prew swings open the door and they go in
prew stops on the threshold stares at the room in happy amazement
it is large smartly furnished
in the rear glass doors lead to a porch
one of the panelled walls is filled with bookshelves floor to ceiling
the bookshelves are filled with books
a hearty feminine voice calls hi
from the kitchen and as prew and alma come into the room gorgette enters from the kitchen
she is a very tall very gay good looking girl
this is gorgette my roommate
gorgette this is prew
i told you about him
dont mind me
im going out in a little while
prew grins cant keep his eyes off the astonishing books
gorgette follows his glance
i belong to the book of the month club
i always take every book
that way i get all the dividends
she giggles and goes off to the bedroom
shell be great for maggio when he gets out of the stockade
hell be crazy about her because shes so tall
alma smiles presses him into a chair
now you just get comfortable and ill make you a martini and see whats to cook for dinner
she starts oft to kitchen
this is just like bein married aint it
over her shoulder as she exits to kitchen its better
shooting through smoke rising from one of the trench ovens
as it clears we see the enormous hawaiian woman and one or two others cleaning up and putting out the remnants of the fires
the merrymakers and dancers have gone the luau is over
quite alone are warden and karen sitting on
the trunk of a fallen palm tree
the abandoned gaiety of the earlier scene gone
they survey the emptiness
the fat hawaiian woman comes near rakes ashes over one of the dying fires
she speaks to warden in hawaiian
he answers her in the native tongue
the fat woman stares shrugs goes off
what did she say
she said its over time to go home
a beach a car a park
warden puts his arm around her tenderly
itll work out
it cant go on like this much longer milt
he rises paces a moment
if there were only a way
your lovin husbandd probly give you the divorce
but even if he didnt know what for hed never let me transfer
bucking up courage there is a way
ive been thinking about it
warden looks at her apprehensively
youve got to become an officer
youre eligible for the extension course that came in with the draft
when you get your commission theyd ship you back to the states new officers arent kept at posts where theyve been enlisted men
then you sure made a thorough study of it
then i could divorce dana and follow you and marry you
ive always hated officers
thats a fine intelligent point of view
suppose i said ive always hated sergeants
that would make a lot of sense wouldnt it
he sits thinks it over unhappily
okay suppose i did it
and dont think its a cinch the exams are tough
then youd be getting your divorce here while im in the states
wed be apart maybe six months
well probly be in the war by then you cant be certain of that put it down on your calendar
on october twenty third milt warden told you wed be in the war in less than a year
why dont you tell the truth
you just dont want the responsibility
youre probably not even in love with me youre crazy
i wish i wasnt in love with you
maybe could enjoy life again
i dont know whats happened to you you were honest at first at first
you were tough and solid as a rock and now youre a whining crybaby he stops abruptly
and so they were married and lived unhappily ever after
they are silent for several moments
ive never been so miserable in my life as i have since i met you
neither have i
i wouldnt trade a minute of it
neither would i
warden rises and paces again
suddenly he stops turns looks down at karen speaks in the same gloomy tone
ill probably make the lousiest officer they ever saw in this army
a happy smile creeps over karens face
despite himself he begins to smile also
youll make a fine officer
a remarkable officer
the porch is at the rear of the house leading off from the living room
it is on the very edge of the cliff
prew and alma are dancing to the music of a portable victrola
it is playing why dont we do this more often
a table still contains the dinner plates
prews expression holds the wonder of a child at a magic show
he misses a step stumbles
i never caught on to dancing much
youre a very good dancer
the record ends and alma goes to change it
camera follows prew to the edge of the porch as he looks out over the view
a magnificent panorama strings of lights in the valley and across on st
louis heights in the far distance the neon of waikiki
working with his thoughts afraid to broach them
he lights a cigarette his fingers trembling
i been wanting to tell you a long time now i love you
looking through records for a new choice
she speaks quite conversationally as if offered a pleasant compliment
because i love you too
she puts on a record it all comes back to me now
it plays throughout the sequence
as alma comes over to prew
i mean it
i need you
because i need you too
a thirty year man is movin all over goin all the time
up to now i never thought a thirty year man had any business to think of gettin married
she stares at him amazed a touch angry
youre a funny one little prew boy
must be the altitude
a very funny one that i cannot figure out
whys it funny if a guy wants to marry you
because im a girl you met at the new congress club
and thats about two steps up from the pavement
okay im a private no class dogface soljer
and the way most civilians look at it thats two steps up from no thin
there is a silence
alma is honestly distraught
oh prew prew i thought we were happy why do you want to spoil things
lissen i aint think in of now
but i got a plan cookin in my head
you want to go back to the states in a year
well you could stretch it some make it two years
and i could swing a sergeants stripes if i were a non com the armyd let me pick my duty when i re enlist
lost in the picture of and theres some posts back in the states like jefferson barracks the married noncoms rate solid brick houses
with lawns with new cut grass and walks with big old oak trees
now i know youve lost your mind
how do you expect to become a sergeant under this captain holmes of yours
its all you can do to keep out of the stockade
i could fight
it i go out for boxin hed send me to non com school
the regimental championship is next month
i bet i could win the middleweight even without training
i used to be pretty good i could do it
alma is deeply moved
she speaks gravely sincerely not at all immodestly
i dont think you should give in to the treatment
even to marry me
thisd be worth it
prew its true we love each other now
but back in america it might be different
we might not even want each other
but that aint the real reason
whats the real reason you wont marry me
i wont marry you because i dont want to be the wife of a soldier
well thats the top i could ever do for you because nobodys going to stop me from my plan
because want to be proper
in a year ill have enough money saved
im going back to my home town in oregon and im going to build a new home for my mother and myself and join the country club and take up
and then ill meet the proper man with the proper position
and ill be a proper wife who can keep a proper home and raise proper children
and i will be happy because when you are proper you are safe
bitterly disappointed but
you got guts alma
i hope you pull it off
the victrola record ends
alma turns away from prew and goes to the victrola
now that shots had her say with such certainty she deflates
except for the fact that she looks like a girl who never cries she looks as if she might cry
she lifts the record off the turntable
but i do mean it when i say i need you
because im lonely
sometimes im dreadfully lonely
you think im lying dont you
nobody ever lies about being lonely
alma puts the same record on again
prew looks out over the beautiful view
ive known about it for a long time
ive sensed it
and im not going to ignore it any longer
i want to know where you met him and just who he is
at breakfast in a nook off the kitchen
holmes is a mixture of petulance anger and frustration
he doesnt touch his food but occasionally takes a sip of coffee
im afraid im not going to tell you
you cant keep a thing like this im not going to hide anything
im just not going to tell you
she applies herself to her food anxious to drop the matter
one thing i know
i know its a civilian
youd be too discreet to pick an army man
i dont think its any of your business who he is
it is my business
im your husband
what do you think a scandal would do to my chances for a promotion
so if youre thinking of a divorce you can forget it
she struggles to maintain her self possession
she manages it keeps outwardly calm through the scene
now how does it feel to know youll have to live with a horror like me the rest of your life
not very nice
but then theres the compensation of knowing youll have to live with me the rest of your life
her attitude makes holmes progressively sorrier for himself
camera moves with him as during following he rises goes to stove pours himself another cup of coffee
he spills a little and the liquid sizzles on the burner
you dont know how a man feels about a thing like this
it breaks a man all up inside
i gander why men feel so differently about it than women
its its just not the same
camera moves with him as he returns to the table decides to try another tack
why do you think ive done all i have
done all what
tried to be a company commander when i hate it worked my fool head off with this miserable boxing squad tagged after the general whenever i could
i dont know
why for you and for me
for our home thats why
i always thought you did it because you wanted to get ahead
she finishes the last of her food stands
its a lovely day out
i think ill go for a walk
holmes catches her wrist stops her
im willing to forgive you
tell me who he is
make a clean breast of it
and ill forgive you
i wonder which is hurt more your pride or your curiosity
she disengages her wrist
when im ready to ask you for a divorce we can discuss it again
she goes to door to pantry pauses there
and do eat your breakfast dana
its getting cold
she goes out to pantry
we hear the sound of the door to rear porch opening and closing
wretched completely at a loss
he stares into space then looks down at his food picks up a fork and ruefully begins to eat
prew on hands and knees is on a weeding detail with three other men one of them sal anderson
another is private nair a tousle headed sentimental man we have not seen before
sergeant thornhill in charge of the detail lolls on the ground his head propped against a tree reading a comic book
prew works his way over to nair
you just get out of the stockade
it was rugged sam
but i kept my mouth shut and watched my step and i wasnt in no trouble
you see maggio
nair nods tells his tale in half humorous half reverent fashion
fatsos workin him over with a hoe handle
places where it wont show mostly
you know the back and the chest
once in a while in the face
know what maggio does when that happens
spits in fatsos eye
oh hes a hot one
aint he a hot one
hes a good boy
course he throws up a little blood now and then
and he passes out a lot
but fatso sure aint reportin none of that
so theres no way they goin to find out
why dont he go to the c
we tried to get him to
but he wont peep
he says he got a lot more scalp to lose first
that boy is about the hardest artery in the hospital
with great sentiment but hes got a heart just like a great big baby
prews face has been growing in fury
he pulls up a clump of sod throws it down with all his might
you think hes gonna be all right
your guess is worth mine sam
maybe hes crackin a little at that cause after fatso put him in the hole thats what they call solitary a couple times he began talkin about how hes gonna
he said to tell you hell look you up one of these nights
a shadow falls across the grass in front of prew
camera shooting up from near the ground the angle exaggerating galavitchs ungainly ape like figure
he looks down at prew full of venom
still on knees eh prewitt
well boxing finals next month
december f if teen
you s till got time help us make champions
prew is at the breaking point
controlling himself he weeds around galovitchs shadow
it moves in front of prew again
are proud dis compny to be or not
bites de hand dat feeds it der shoot dogs for
infortunately ony dogs day are allowed to shoot not men
the other men have stopped weeding are looking over at prew and galovitch
thornhill in b
puts down the comic book and comes over to them during following
get outa my way ike
i aint gonna move around you again
you need better lesson than up to now
maybe i give to you myself
maybe right now
he steps on prews hand
as prew jerks away from the heavy shoe galovitch hauls him up by his fatigue shirt
thornhill steps between them
ey leave him alone
es in my prew shoves thornhill aside cold decision in his eyes
he starts unbuttoning his shirt
its gonna be your way
galovitch rips off his shirt bursting some of the buttons as he does
stripped to the waist his whole appearance seems to change he looks as he did in the ring a hard muscled prize fighter
ey wait a minute you guys
prew is barely able to get out of his shirt before galovitch charges him
during following men run from across the quadrangle and from out of the barracks to watch the affair form a circle around
prew is a skillful boxer moving around galovitch quickly and cleverly
galovitch is more lumbering but not awkward
his heavy blows stagger prew several times
prew drives his attack at his opponents body
he never throws a punch at the others head
the head prew
hit him in the head
the other men around shout similar advice
puzzled by prews concentration on his body and by the shouts of the men
he seems to be wondering if prew is pulling a trick
a fear not born of cowardice is reflected on prews face as he sets himself stares at galovitch
he seems haunted by the memory of dixie wells
flinching without being hit
he seems mesmerized by the others eyes
galovitch draws blood from a cut over prews eye
he is getting the better of the battle
thornhill breaks out of the crowd and runs across the quadrangle
i dont get it why dont prew go for the head
he blinded a guy once
must be scairt of the same thing
as galovitch batters prew back against the crowd
a right to the temple sends him to his knees
he shakes his head a moment gets up and goes into a clinch
the windows are crowded with men watching the fight
long shot out window to front of barracks shooting over heads of men watching out to prew and galovitch on the ground
dispassionate professional ad libs from the men why does prew continue his attack to the body only a good little man and a good big man etc
warden is at his desk filling out an application blank
holmes is glancing over his shoulder
wardens hand in shot filling out answers to sex age race etc
ill be glad to recommend you warden
youve got service experience grade
youll make an excellent officer
holmes waits for thanks
thank you sir
the screen door in the orderly room bangs
thornhill runs into the office breathless
he comes to a shaking attention as he sees holmes
at ease sergeant
whats the matter
they fightin on the green sir
galovitch and prewitt
ike looks like e goin to murder him sir
a pleased look crosses holmes face
warden jumps up starts for door
holmes catches his arm
theres no rush
ill take care of it
holmes goes out
thornhill follows turns at the door
aint you want to see it first
i aint want to see it
nor you either
get out of here
the screen door in the orderly room bangs
warden walks to his desk stares down at the application form picks it up
he carries it over to holmes desk
he looks at the picture of karen on the desk
he stares at the picture then looks at the application blank
then he looks down at the chevrons on his arm
he rubs his hand over the chevrons gently fondly
he looks at the application blank again very thoughtfully
a continuation of the fight
prew is tiring his face is cut and bleeding and there is a welt under one eye
galovitch is unmarked but grunting now from prews constant jabs at his stomach
he seems perplexed as before by his opponent s tactics
featuring the non ath a leets of g company including anderson clark and treadwell
ad libbed shouts of in the face prew
in the face
featuring the ath a loots including dhom wilson and henderson
they are watching quietly nodding with approval as prew feints then darts several punches into galovitchs ribs it almost seems as if they are admiring prews courage inwardly rooting for
holmes enters the group thornhill tagging after him
holmes stops and watches the fight
there is a look of satisfaction on his face
the fight continuing
near rear of crowd
an officer walking across the lawn is attracted by the noise
he steps into the crowd
this is colonel williams
he wears the insignia of the inspector generals department
he watches the fight is about to step through to break it up when he sees holmes
he stops watches holmes reactions
prew backed up against the crowd trips over somebodys feet
he falls without being hit
galovitch kicks at him and prew rolls away
the crowd murmurs angrily
sergeant stark steps out into the open circle faces galovitch
this aint no rassle ike
you got to fight this man fair
approving shouts from the crowd
stark steps back
ike waits for prew to get up
looking up at galovitch
his eyes narrow harden as if his inner struggle has been resolved
prew gets to his feet
as galovitch comes to him prew feints for the stomach then throws a hard right to galovitchs face
it hits him flush on the nose
the crowd roars
galovitch surprised and hurt throws up his hands
prew drives both fists to his solar plexus
galovitch drops his guard
prew smashes him in the face and adams apple
galovitch falls to his knees hawking and choking
the whole nature of the fight has changed
galovitch hurt and reeling rushes prew bull like head down defense wide open
prew dodges easily slamming hard with rights and lefts to the head
holmes seeing prew is now clearly in command steps out of the crowd and up to the two fighters
lets cut it
there is a look of relief on the faces of both galovitch and prew as they stop fighting
what started this
prewitt talk back to non com
refuse order i give him start fight
i teach him lesson
a laugh from the crowd
you wont disobey any more orders in my company prewitt
warden saved you from a court martial once but he wont this time anderson steps into the circle
sir im sorry sir but private prewitts not to blame for this
sergeant galovitch started it
holmes reacts momentarily at a loss
he turns to thornhill
thornhill youre in charge of this detail
how about it
thornhill steps into the circle nods toward anderson
es right sir
points to galovitch e begun it
prewitt done nothin
from the crowd step sergeants dhom wilson and henderson
they face holmes and galovitch implacably
no sir this wasnt prewitts fault
thats right sir
everybody knows galovitch started it
there is a murmur of agreement from the crowd
holmes looks at his fighters rocked by this betrayal
they stare back at him
still near the rear of the crowd he watches the scene with much interest
holmes pulls himself together turns to the crowd
break it off
lets get back to our jobs
to prew and galovitch im giving you two a break
ill ignore this
he walks off
he does not see colonel williams
galovitch moves off toward the barracks
wilson henderson and thornhill remain grouped around prew
you guys figure this means im steppin into a ring youre wrong
its your show kid
run it the way you want
you better put same iodine on them cuts
an come over to choys tonight
we buy you a beer
the non coms walk off prew stares after them
sounds of gaiety from the beerhouse mingle with the mournful twang of guitars being played by clark and anderson
camera moves slowly toward the trio until the beerhouse noises are
the men are surrounded by many empty beer bottles
woke up sick on thursday feelin like my head took a dare looked down at my trousers all my pockets was bare that girl sure was bad news re enlistment
the guitars finish the stanza with a flourish as camera holds on medium shot
the men chuckle
some day im goin back to scranton and play it for my folks
and tell em it wan composed in the hawaiian islands
clear across the pacific ocean
finishes long swig of hey friday
why you called friday
i was borned on wednesday
plucks guitar sings went back around on friday asked for a free glass of beer
the three laugh sing in unison
my friends had disappeared barman said take off no credit here
the music from across the road almost lost in the laughter and shouts from the beerhouse
warden comes out wobbles a bit
he has one on
he cups his hand over his ear straining to hear the singing
he stumbles into choate coming along the sidewalk
top you sure plastered
i am off duty
off duty if i want to get plastered but choate has gone into choys
camera retreats with warden as he wanders to the road still trying to locate the singing
half way across the road he unceremoniously sits down crosses his knees buddha wise
here the singing is more audible
he listens contentedly
aint no time to lose re enlistment blues
anderson as usual finishes the stanza with a brilliant display on the guitar
prew stands up
in the glow of a streetlight his face shows the marks of his battle with galovitch
he wobbles and we realize he too really has one on
where you go in
back to choys
get nother drink
the guitars and singing continues in b
camera pans with prew as he weaves to the road
as prew crosses
he can see the seated figure but the light from the street is too dim to identify it
prew stops automatically
who goes there
advance friend and be reconized
prew moves closer camera with him until he recognizes warden
roaring laughing quiet
hit the track
dis a drill not picnic
whatever you doin out all by yourself
im goin to get a drink
i got a bottle
he pulls a bottle of whisky from his field jacket holds it up to prew
prew takes the bottle and drinks
then he sits down in the road as matter of factly as did warden
he gives the bottle back to warden
i hand it to you kid
they called off the treatment this afternoon
when you beat up ike
i never heard of no soljer before ever lickin the treatment

they square their shoulders heroically
as if to an invisible no blindfold
save it to wipe your nose on you skunk
each takes a drink
prew i got the biggest troubles in the whole world
the whole world

prew nods gravely
youll unerstan then

a man should be what he can do
warden nods solemnly as if prew has uttered a great truth
they pass the bottle once more
hows your girl
whast that name again
oh yeah i remember
warden claps prew on the shoulder as if he is a lifelong friend
they look as if they are sharing a great secret a secret known to them alone in the world
the mournful guitars and singing comes over a little louder
the headlights of a jeep descend upon warden and prew
then the vehicle skids into the shot with a screeching of brakes comes to a halt directly in front of the men
warden and prew look at the car calmly dont move
the headlights are blazing on them
stark hops out from the drivers seat furious
whatsa matter with you you crazy dumb screwballs
you tryin to get killed
what you doin with that jeep sergeant stark
i borrowed it
im goin to town
what you doin in the middle of the road
the music of the guitars has stopped
there is a strange whine now far in the distance not identifiable
it grows during following
my friend prew and i sittin here discussin the weather
your friend huh
you beard me
i said my buddy warden
my good friend warden that you better not run over is what i said
dont you know you got to look out for this man

hes the best stinkin soljer in the compny
you both must be plumb nuts
you heard me
get this man to some safety
why hes the best stinkin soljer in the compny
i guess im the one whos nuts
as he stumbles around the side of the jeep directly into the blaze of the headlights
there are scars new and healing on maggios face
one of his ears is cauliflowered enough to give him the lopsided ribald look of a punchy
a couple of teeth are missing
weirdly outlined in the glare he is a nightmare figure an apparition
the whine in the distance is identifiable now
it is the siren of the stockade
figgered you might be at choys
the men gape at maggio unable to accept the shock of his appearance
then prew and warden jump up and catch him as he is about to fall
the drunkenness drains out of them
stark watches in bewilderment
spewing words out done it like i said
e scape like i figgered
under a tarp inna back of a truck from the motor pool they rode me right out just like i figgered like i said
ony the tailgate came down bout a mile back
an i fell inns road
shoulda seen me bounce
musta broke somethin
clutches prews shirt prew
warden steps back as prew holds maggio
during following anderson and clark come over watch pop eyed
fatso done it to me
yestiday he did it for keeps
he likes to whack me in the gut with a hoe handle an then he asks that hurt
and then i spit at him
ony yestiday he done it ten times runnin an somethin bust

maggio grasps him tighter
he is crying now

hell try to crack you but you aint gonna crack
hes gonna see you but hell never see you saw
n when he puts you in the hole you just lay there n be still
ats the ony way be still
n remember things
but not people
things like nature
woods you been in
trees is awys good
he goes limp in prews arms slides to the road
warden bends over maggio
the others watch scared
staring down at maggio
warden looks up
but he was here just a minute ago
prew bends over picks up maggio holds him in his arms gently unbelieving
theyll figure he got killed fallin out of that truck
he aint dead
camera moves ahead of prew as he carries maggio to the jeep the others following
he lifts maggio into the rear of the jeep
warden puts his hand on prews arm
hes dead prew
prew stares at maggio lying in the jeep
stark gets into the front of the jeep
ill take him prew
he starts the motor
prew leans over moves maggios body a little
see his head dont bump
the jeep drives off
framed beautifully in the moonlight the quadrangle and barracks area look like a college campus
a figure can be seen far in b
g at the buglers post beside the megaphone
another figure stands near him
the silence continues then is broken by the sound of the bugle beginning
the first note is incredibly clear and loud and certain
it is held longer than most buglers hold it
the second note is daringly short abrupt
the last note of the first phrase rises peals out heartfelt
two men come into the shot smoking
they stop turn toward the bugler listen attentively
one of them flips away his cigarette
the taps continues through the following
most of the men turn in their beds toward the sound of the bugle
some prop up on their elbows
as he listens
a look of mingled longing and satisfaction
a strange look of pride
listening his face also betraying emotions normally concealed
their bunks are next to each other
a reverent whisper i bet you its prewitt
three men come out of the barracks lean over the porch rail listening
their faces are thoughtful sad
the office lit only by a light over his desk
he is working late a sheaf of papers spread out before him
he listens to the bugle call moved sorrowful
he snaps off the light listens in the darkness
at the buglers post
he is finishing the last phrases full and wonderful
behind him stands friday clark motionless
the final note quivers to silence
prew swings the megaphone for the repeat
then the repeat begins the clear proud notes reverberating across the silent quadrangle
lying on his back in his bunk arms clasped behind his head
he listens his gnarled face the picture of the old soldier
he breathes heavily as if he is hearing his own requiem and epitaph
there are eight or nine men here now listening
there is a choked kinship on all the faces
more men are propped on their elbows their heads turned toward the bugler
the dim figure of treadwell can be seen at a window now
almost inaudible whisper i told you it was prewitt
continuing the taps
there are tears in his eyes now
a half dozen men are sitting on the steps listening among them stark and wilson
stark shakes his head sadly
listening now on the porch alongside the street
several groups of two and three scattered about
they are standing in no particular places as if they have been walking and stopped suddenly
they are all looking toward the bugler
as the taps repeat is drawing to a close
he is lying on his side turned toward the bugler a look of serenity of peace on his face
his eyes close as he falls asleep
coming to the end of the taps
camera moves in to a closeup
prews face is wet with tears
his lips are pinched and red
he blows the final notes
prew lowers the bugle slowly and lets the megaphone rest in its swivel
he withdraws the mouthpiece puts it in his pocket
he hands the bugle to clark
clark looks at the instrument as if it has become hallowed
prew walks off into the darkness
camera moves along street passing a lone pedestrian
it moves toward the sign new congress club holds beside an open window through which is heard the sound of harsh piano playing the pounding style and lack of shading
are clearly fatso judsons
camera pans and includes prew leaning against the building
he is watching the entrance to the club patiently
there is relentless hatred on his face
the music stops
prew does not move
hearty male laughter from within
the door opens and fatso and a couple of sailors cane out
they are about to start down the street
fatso looks around in direction of voice
camera pans discloses prew still leaning against the building
fatso squints not recognizing him
you want me
fatso takes a couple of steps toward prew squints again
i dont like that nickname
you want to see me about somethin
lets step around the corner here where we can talk
prews voice is so toneless as to be ominous
good night gents
the sailors go off
fatso walks into the darkness of an alley next to the building
just enough light from the street lamp to illuminate about ten feet into the alley
you sore about somethin
i just dont like the way you play the piano
fatso throws back his head and laughs loudly
you know maggio
the little wop
the one who bust out of the stockade
he was a real tough monkey
but crazy see
you killed him
if i did he ask for it
i hear theyre gonna court martial you fatso
but before the army gets you i want a piece of you myself
there is the snick of a blade snapping open as fatso pulls a knife
he moves toward prew who steps swiftly to one side
i kinds thought youd try that
there is the same sound as prew pulls a knife from his pocket snaps it open holds it out flat in his hand showing it to fatso
this heres the one you pulled on maggio once
fatso darts at prew knife raised
prew moves back but fatso is on him and they both roll to one side along the building
the movement throws them deep into the shadows
the two figures feint and dart
there is the occasional silver flash of the knives as light hits them
the men go deeper into the shadows are all but lost to view
there is a startled pained cry
then one of the figures falls to his knees and starts to crawl toward camera
as the figure comes directly to camera revealing the anguished face of fatso
it slowly turns is upside down in the frame
fatso is on his back his stomach gushing bloods his eyes already glazing
prew staggers into the light now
his left side has two vicious cuts he is bleeding badly
he stares down at fatso who manages a small reproving voice
youve killed me
whyd you want to kill me
prew backs away from fatso turns staggers down the alley away from camera
prew comes toward camera laboriously struggling up the road
his side is hemorrhaging steadily his shirt and trousers blood soaked
he stops close to camera
he wads his handkerchief sticks it inside his shirt near the knife wound
he smiles wearily crookedly
mumbles to himself gonna have an awful bad scar there
he lights a cigarette his fingers shaking
the flame from the match illuminates his left wrist
there is a deep scar on it
it seems to fascinate prew as he stares at it rubs his fingers across it
he turns moves on up the road camera moves close behind him as if overhearing his thoughts which come over on sound track
got that one fallin off the barn back home
gashed it on a spike
uncle john s dead too
prew moves away from camera out of shot
camera follows prew as he keeps in shadows moves slowly up the cliff
he is in much pain now
his hand rubs across his face his fingers linger on his forehead near his eye
that cut over the eye
in the ring at myer
wouldnt let em stop it
knocked the guy out
camera loses prew again as he stumbles into shadows
camera follows prew who is now fighting hard to keep his feet
his hand is pressed tight to his side
ten stitch gash in the hip
workin in the gym attic
fell through the skylight
where was that
so many scars
so many years
where they all gone to anyway
he moves on around bend in road out of shot
the radio is blaring the hut sut song
alma is crocheting
gorgette is reading
camera shoots across them to the front door
the doorknob moves slowly the door opens
prew falls into the room and pitches to the floor
she rushes to him bends over him
gorgette runs to the radio turns it off
her face agonized as she leans over prew
he pushes himself up on one elbow seems pleased by her stricken expression
he manages a smile
aint gonna die
they savin me for better things
gorgette kneels into shot
prews smile becomes silly as he turns his head to her
just came up to borrow a good book
the american flag the generals flag and the division flag are the only colorful elements in a rather severe office
colonel williams is reading from a typed report
in addition to inefficiency in administering his command and neglect of duty captain holmes has been guilty of indefensible cruelty to the aforesaid private prewitt
this extended to instigating and encouraging wholly unauthorized and discreditable tactics to force the soldier to join the inter regiment boxing team
these findings are the result of personal investigation by the inspector general and are corroborated by numerous members of g company
colonel williams puts his report on the generals desk
holmes face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he has really expected something like this for a long time
he makes no move to speak
the general is angry clear through
im waiting for your reply to this
i havent any sir
the charges are true
holmes the first thing i ever learned in the army was that an officer takes care of his men
it seems to be the first thing you forgot
its monstrous to think of anybody like you in command of troops
and believe me you wont be for long
my only regret is that we have to keep you in uniform until a court martial is concluded
general slater contd in the meantime of course im relieving you of your present duties
he indicates the meeting is over
holmes rises is about to leave pauses
if there were any way to avoid a court martial sir
the general frowns is unresponsive
holmes looks to colonel williams helplessly
there is one alternative general
if youre so disposed
a resignation for the good of the service under ar
thinks a moment ill give you a chance you dont deserve holmes
write a letter of resignation and have it on my desk this afternoon
ill consider accepting it
only because as far as im concerned the quicker youre out of the army the better for everybody
especially the army
he confronts her waving a sheet of stationery
his voice is strangled almost hysterical
thats right its a letter of resignations im through
ive already been relieved
so you can begin packing
were sailing for the states next week
she shakes her head not wanting to believe she takes the letter out of his hand starts to read it
she stops after a sentence or two
her hand falls to her side
holmes sits on the bed heavily
the bluster bleeds out of him
he shakes his head emotionally bewildered
for perhaps the first time in his life he is nakedly honest
where has it gone karen
what happened to it
the gay cheerful life we were going to have you and i
what happened to me
the proud dashing officer was going to be
the leader of men
ive known all along how the men felt about me
they despised me
i dont remember losing anything
where has it all gone
reacting she is surprised a little afraid of her own emotion
the outcry so lost so despairing moves her
she is sorry for him
karen youre coming back with me arent you
trembling karen puts the letter on the dressing table
abruptly she runs out of the room
featuring placard reading lieutenant ross
we hear ross first few words over this then camera pulls back to medium shot
ross is forceful clean cut gives the impression of toughness but fairness
as he talks he takes down the photographs of prize fighters and prize fighting from the wall
watching and listening are sergeants dhom thornhill henderson leva stark and karelsen and corporal wilson
ross is such a complete switch from holmes that the men are almost unnerved by him
but a definite respect is reflected in their expressions
warden beside his desk shares this
i dont intend to have a sloppy outfit
i dont intend to have a goldbrick outfit
i dont intend to have a soft soap outfit
ive called you noncoms in because youre the backbone of any company
from now on youll have to prove youre entitled to have those stripes here
and not in the boxing ring
he bands the pictures to leva
get rid of these sergeant
thats all i have to say
if youve any questions speak up
the men troop out passing camera
as last man leaves camera is on warden
he is looking at ross with considerable approval even admiration
he resumes a more normal expression as ross turns toward him
one non com was missing sir
private galovitch is in the kitchen
in the kitchen
as of now hes an assistant cook
i busted him
on a blanket charge of inefficiency
what are you grinning at
i think the company commander made a wise decision sir
the phone rings
warden goes to his desk answers
compny g first sergeant warden speaking
karens voice is heard on the phone we cannot understand what she is saying but a flood of words pours through
with ross looking on warden is embarrassed
yes i know
glances over toward ross yes the uh parcel has already arrived
no well have to talk about it soon
i i dont know
ross perceives wardens distress
he starts toward the door
warden nods gratefully
ross smiles leaves the room
lissen ill get away somehow tonight
ill meet you in kuhio park
he puts down the receiver
he stares at the desk
then he slowly pulls out the top drawer
the officers application blank is lying on top of a pile of other papers
he takes it out looks at it somberly
camera moves in to an insert of the application
we see wardens answers to sex age race etc
camera moves down the page to the place for the signature of the applicant
it is unsigned
warden in uniform and karen are sitting on the same bench as in their first meeting in the park
we cannot hear what they are saying at first
camera moves in past a few pedestrians and holds on a medium shot
there is a defeated tired look about them as if they have been talking for a long time to no avail
i guess i felt it that night i asked you to become an officer
when you didnt say yes right away
i guess i knew deep down you wouldnt do it
but a hint of tears it seemed such a simple plan for us
i wanted to i tried but i couldnt
he runs his hand through his hair
he seems to be groping inside himself for some way to explain
lissen theres a kid in our outfit named prewitt
he came in from the states about a year ago
i thought he was a fresh punk at first
until i got to know him a little
hes awol right now probly in some kind of real trouble he aint the kind to go awol otherwise
anyway i keep remembering somethin he said to me the first day he came in
he said a man has got to go his own way
if he dont hes nothin
im an enlisted man
im a first sergeant
once i cross that line and tried to be an officer im somebody i dont know
and a man has got to be what he is
i guess thats the trouble with dana
hes always tried to be something he isnt
i dont think he ever needed me until now
shaken herself out of it well here we are saying goodbye
and talking about two other people
were not saying good bye well figger out a way for you to stay im going back with him milt
theres something in being needed
it isnt love
but its something
lissen two people who love each other just dont stop loving each other
nothin and nobody is goin to break us up l transfer out somehow and get back to the states
maybe itll take a little time but ill do it
that sounds like milt warden all right
he bends toward her to kiss her
she presses him back
i dont want to kiss you any more
i just want to remember you
and you to remember me
put it down
put it down that on december th milton anthony warden told you hed remember you
camera pulls back passes a few pedestrians warden and karen remaining in b
they begin to talk again quietly undemonstratively
we are too far away now to hear what they are saying
alma is reading a newspaper in b
prew is disheveled and slovenly needs a shave badly
his face is lined with pain
he is drunk from several days of steady drinking stone drunk as if in a trance
he wears crumpled civilian clothes
he is at a table laboriously writing out the re enlistment blues
he finishes writing a stanza and sings softly
slep in the park that sunday seen all the folks gain to church your belly feel so empty when youre left in the lurch alma looks up from the paper
here it is theyre putting it on an inside page already
still no clue in the fatal stabbing of staff sergeant james r
prew who has stopped singing but not turned his head resumes the song
dog soljers dont own pews re enlistment blues
did you hear me
are you listening or not
prew nods blankly
he rises slowly and walks across the room toward alma
but his eyes are fixed on a whisky bottle on a table beside her
he moves stiffly favoring his side his face contorted
he picks up the bottle pours himself a drink
are you trying to set a new worlds record
he smiles faintly holds the glass high
to the memory of robert e
lee prewitt holder of the new worlds record
i want to know what you plan to do
plan to do
counts on fingers
four days im awol aint i
picks up paper looks at this is december sixth aint it
half tirade half wail its december sixth and youre so drunk youre wall eyed
and all youve done since you fell in here is drink and drink and drink and try to remember that old song of yours
and i want to know what youre going to do
prew looks at her hurt
he moves back to his table mumbling
might ship out on a tramp and go to mexico and be a cowboy
oh be sensible
prew sits at the table again continues to mumble
im goin back to the compny
soons my side heals
goin back under my own power
goin into the ordrly room n say hello warden private prewitt reportin
why did you have to do it
why did you have to kill that man
prew shakes his head sadly as if he doesnt know the answer
he picks up the paper he has been writing on sings softly testing the last couple of lines affectionately
recruitin crews give me the blues old re enlistment blues
camera features clock on wall reading
about half the company is at breakfast
there is considerable laughter and horseplay
near the kitchen a dozen men are in the chow line
featuring warden at the nco table
he rises carries his plate with him towards the chow line
a sudden deep toned earthquake like blast shudders through the room
the cups on the tables rattle
warden stops cocks his head
the men stop eating look at each other
to the room must be dynamitin down to wheeler field
them engineers mighty ambitious sunday mornin before eight oclock
the men resume eating
warden moves a couple of steps toward the chow line when the second blast hits
it is much heavier and fuller
he has a hunch about this now
he reaches out to put his plate down holding it very carefully in both hands
however he doesnt bother to see if there is anything under it
the plate falls and crashes on the floor a fraction of a second before the third groundswell of blast shakes the room
a man sprints toward the mess hall yelling to right and left at the top of his lungs
as he approaches camera we see it is mazzioli
the japsre bombing wheeler field
its the japs
theyre bombing wheeler field
its the japs
i saw the red circles on the wings
the roar of the plane over shot
the figure of mazzioli gets closer and closer as the plane
dives toward him machine guns spitting
as the jap plane flashes by close above him
the stones in the pavement pop up
mazzioli flops on the street
the plane zooms
as the men rush out
in the front ranks are warden karelsen stark and choate choate carries his half filled plate in one hand a mug of coffee in the other
the men stretch their necks following the plane
then they look back up the street camera panning
far in b
g a column of black mushrooming to the sky
warden dashes to mazzioli
camera moves in to a close shot as warden bends over him hoists him to a sitting position
he is extremely gentle
mazziolis knee is laid open and is bleeding freely
warden whips out a handkerchief and starts to apply a tourniquet
some of the men continue to crane at the sky
a few pick up metal links from the jap bullets
thisll make me a good souvenir
a bullet from a jap plane
this aint jawbone
this is for record
theme real bullets that guy was usin
get inside all of ya
warden gets mazzioli to his feet turns to first man in group surrounding them
it is anderson
help him over to the hospital
anderson starts mazzioli down the street
a pair of planes are diving toward the street
the men rush for cover all except choate who is left alone in shot
he takes a big bite of his sausage and eggs hastily downs a swig of coffee
then he throws the plate and cup into the street and dives for cover as the terrifyingly loud noise of the jap planes indicates they are directly overhead
the men are pouring in from the company street all shouting at once
warden pushes his way through them and jumps up on the pool table
his big voice booms
all right all right you men
its only a war
aint you ever been in a war before
the men begin to quiet down look to warden respectfully
through the scene the heavy earth shudders are felt and heard as bombs hit in the far distance
also the sound of the strafing planes
were gonna organize a fire umbrella defense
i want the non coms to get bars and ammunition from the supply room and get up on the roof
henderson youre in charge of the loading detail
the non coms push out the door
hey what about me

treadwell hurries after the non coms
the rest of you guys the cq will unlock the rifle racks
every man get his rifle and go to his bunk and stay there
and i mean stay there
im making each squad leader responsible to keep his men inside
if you have to use a rifle butt to do it thats okay too
there are shouts of protest
the men are over the first shock now and beginning to get angry anxious for action
you heard me
this aint no maneuvers
you go runnin around outside youll get your ears shot off
you want to be heroes youll get plenty chances later
youll probly have japs in your laps before night
what if they bomb us

but dont worry the japsll probly drop all their bombs on pearl harbor and hickam
they aint gonna waste em on us
so lets can the chatter

squad leaders get em upstairs
squad leaders begin to herd their men out
warden jumps off the pool table
stark and karelsen come up to him
what you want me to do first

no make a barrel of coffee
i think i could get one of them japs with a machine gun milt
well put the tripod over a chimney
and hold her down by the legs
whatever you say pete
they smile at each other affectionately then push into the crowd leaving the day room
the non coma are arguing violently with leva at the door to the supply room
jap planes are loud overhead
i dont care
i cant issue any live ammunition without a signed order from an officer
but there aint no officers yet you jerk
lieutenant ross lives off the post
im sorry fellows
lieutenant ross give me them orders himself
no signed order no ammo
and thats all they are to it
warden hurries up to the group
he wont let us have no ammo top
hats got it locked up
an the keys in his pocket
gimme them keys

i got to obey my orders
no live ammo without a they flatten against the wall as a jap plane roars building high down the street machine guns flaring
after it passes they rush back to lava whats the matter

lava puts his hand in his pocket protectively shakes his head
i aint gonna do it top
chief bust the door down

choate henderson and dhom back up for a run at the door
leva moves in front of the door
bust it down
hell get out of the way
remember i warned you
i did my best
ill see you get a medal
warden dashes up the porch steps as choate henderson and dhom launch themselves at the door
leva steps aside
the door rattles ponderously then flies open
the three battering rams careen into the supply room
the men standing by cheer and rush in after them
leva shakes his head grimly
the men are sitting on their bunks unhappily holding their rifles
others who have slept through breakfast are dressing hastily
warden rushes into the room
the men immediately bark ad libbed questions at him whats the deal first
why cant we go up on the roof
wheres the ammo top
are we soljers or boy scouts
start rollin full field packs
we may have to move out of here
squad leaders get em packin
henderson and others are going up the porch stairs to the roof
they tote bars and loading clips
karelsen and two helpers follow with a heavy machine gun and belt boxes
warden starts for the porch stairs
he is attracted by something stops looks out of scene
lying under an empty bunk with three mattresses piled on it
he is in his underwear and a helmet hugs his rifle
youll catch a cold turp
dont go out there first sergeant
youll be killed
theyre shootin it up
youll be dead
youll not be alive any more
dont go out there
you better put your pants on
warden hits the floor as a plane is heard so loud and low it sounds as if its coming right into the room
a dotted line of bullets crosses the floor and moves into wardens and karelsens room
warden jumps up and rushes into the room
as warden runs in
broken glass lies all over the floor
bullet holes are stitched across the top of wardens footlocker
he throws back the lid fiercely
his linen is polka dotted with holes
he tosses out shirts shorts etc
digs underneath them
he pulls out a quart bottle of whisky it is untouched
warden smiles with relief
he lifts the bottle to his lips drinks long and heartily
about twenty of company gis men including almost all the non cams are on the roof they are crouched behind the chimneys or down on their knees in the corners
the bars are propped on the low walls or chimney tops their muzzles pointed to the sky
three jap planes forming a v are heading straight for camera
come on you dirty sons the scream of the planes drowns dhoms voice
there is a tremendous clatter as the men fire
the jap planes pass untouched
from this moment on there is no letup of the noise there is a wild cacophony of jap planes bars karelsens machine gun the deep sound of bombs hitting in
the far distance
and chief choate singing the regimental marching song loudly and lustily
as warden comes up on the roof through the skylight
he shouts incoherently at the men
they shout back in a wild cheer
they are like a pack of hungry men enjoying their first big meal in years
the jap v has swung about and heads back
warden grabs a bar from the roof
grinning as his plane dives its guns roaring
his silk scarf ripples out behind him
firing the bar standing as the jap planes roar over
he staggers back from the recoil
the men fire in unison
they rise after the planes pass shake their fists
henderson and others of the loading detail appear on the roof bringing up more ammunition
he lets out a hoarse yell of glee and pride
these are my boys
this is my company it seems to say
the men answer back with a great answering shout
warden makes a tour of the roof laughing exhorting slapping the men on their buttocks like a quarterback
they respond with tremendous spirit they are having one hell of a time
we get only a snatch of what warden is yelling
dont worry about wasting ammo
throw your empty clips down into the yard
the loading detail will pick em up the sound of a bugle blowing insistently is now heard blending into the rest of the noise
treadwell runs to the edge of the roof looks over
at the buglers post friday clark is sounding a call
treadwell turns yells at the men
fridays gone crazy
hes blowing the cavalry charge
his cheeks puffed blowing the bugle madly
he is lying on a couch in pajamas
he has not shaven his hair is unkempt
a radio announcer is heard over shot
prew wakens groggy with hangover and near delirium wrestles with the blanket over him
camera pulls back to medium shot disclosing alma and gorgette
they have negligees over their nightgowns are listening to the radio
the announcers voice tries hard to be calm and official but he cannot keep the tremor out of it
note transcripts of the actual broadcast have been requested
this is a real attack not a maneuver
the japanese are bombing pearl harbor
please keep in your homes
do not go on the streets
i repeat this is a real attack
japanese planes are bombing our naval and army installations
civilians will remain in their homes
this is a real attack the announcers voice goes on as above
oh those dirty germans
those dirty sneakin germans
points to the radio them
its the japs
attacks are now taking place at pearl wheeler hickam and schofield
alma shakes prew hard
he falls back on the couch passes out
the jap strafing attack is continuing
their planes are making a figure in the sky
silhouettes of men on the roof can b e seen
friday clark is blowing his cavalry charge
men of the loading detail are scurrying around
lieutenant ross runs into shot
camera pans him across the quadrangle toward the barracks
lieutenant ross is hailed by the loading detail about ten men
he grabs a bar and ammunition from them and runs into the barracks
the loading detail is working feverishly same carrying ammunition into the barracks others picking up empty clips as they are thrown from the roof and hustling them toward the supply
he is working hard passing out ammunition to members of the loading detail
but he shakes his head dourly as if the whole thing is still very unofficial
as before pandemonium but controlled and efficient
the men are hoarse from shouting red eyed puffing from excitement and exertion
two jap planes swoop past and the full throated umbrella of fire lets loose
lieutenant ross clambers onto the roof stooping under the burden of the bar and loading clips
the men greet him with a concerted cheer
ross looks around the roof nods with evident approval claps warden on the shoulder
sound of jap planes comes up ear splitting loud
ross drops down behind a chimney swings his bar fires
camera moves to include karelsen at the other side of the chimney firing the machine gun
two soldiers hang onto the bucking legs of the tripod
two jap planes pass in b
of shot zoom off into the sky
led him too tar
as the men on the roof reload
in the distance the jap planes have turned and are heading back for the roof
their lips curled bitterly as their planes head for the roof
firing a bar at the planes
singing as he fires
firing the machine gun
he yanks the tripod away from his helpers picks up the gun stands and swings it after the plane
the recoil staggers him half way across the roof and deposits him on his rear
he jumps in his seat like a man tied to a hot stove throws up his arms helplessly
the jap plane bursts into flame and crashes
the men rise as one with an uproarious cheer
they rush to karelsen pick him up
warden lets go with another of his rebel yells
you got him pete
you got him
spits over roof ah nobodyll ever know which of us got that guy
as the men return to their positions
two planes head for them pass over as company g lets go again with everything it has
pointing after second of hey
that last one was one of ours
that was an american plane
well he aint got no business here
were takin care of this sector
swooping across the quadrangle about ten feet from the ground
friday clark blowing the cavalry charge madly abandons the megaphone as he sees the plane coming
he drops on his chest hugging the bugle
the plane passes
clark jumps up instantly resumes blowing the charge
the same plane has gained altitude so that it is a few feet above the barracks as it heads straight for the roof
the men flatten all but warden
he stands swings his bar toward the plane
camera is angled so that warden is silhouetted against the sky as he fires at the jap plane
it misses the roof by a foot or two zooms up at a weird angle
a thick cloud of smoke pours out of the engine
the plane falls off on one wing and crashes into trees at the end of the quadrangle
the gas tank explodes
a cloud of fire and black
smoke obscures the screen
there are improvised blackout curtains over windows and the glass doors
the radio is on volume low and an announcer not the one of the morning is droning out an account of pearl harbor
prew still on the couch in his pajamas looks as if he has just struggled to wakefulness
he listens to the radio for a few moments in confused disbelief
he shakes his head vigorously as if to throw off his grogginess
he shakes his head again slowly more knowingly now nodding as if he remembers something from the broadcast of the morning
then as if all of it hits him suddenly and fully and terribly he wrenches himself off the couch
he looks around at the dimly lit room
he goes to the blackout curtains peeps out
then he turns back to listen to the radio
abruptly he runs into the bedroom
the room remains empty for a few moments as the radio announcer goes on continuing previous remarks
ready to fight and die for us our regular army and navy have this day upheld the faith and confidence we have always placed in them
they have proved their right to the esteem we have always had for them
prew comes back into the room
he has his shoes on holds civilian shirt and pants in his hand
he starts to put them on hurriedly his attention still focused on the broadcast
the front door opens and alma and gorgette enter
they are surprised to see prew up
he nods at them turns back quickly to listen to the radio as he continues dressing
the attack caused serious damage to many installations of which pearl harbor suffered the worst
radio announcers voice contd we will not forget this day and we will never let the japanese forget it
yells at radio you said it
who they think theyre fight in
incoherent with rage to theyre pickin trouble with the best army in the best riflemen you know we the ony country on the face of the earth that uses the
shooting gunsling not the carrying gunsling
you know that
the radio continues on under the scene
alma and gorgette speak breathlessly in a rush
weve been at queens hospital giving blood the towns a madhouse
trucks busses jeeps all over a house on kuhio street was bombed and the drugstore on mckully and king is smashed flat
and the man and his wife were killed prew gestures to radio as if hes heard all about it
he sticks his shirttails into his trousers
i gotta get back to the post ill try to get in touch with you in a couple days the post
prew nods vehemently moves across room to a table
theres a war goin on
but you cant
youre not fit yet youre weak as a kitten youre awol theyll throw you in the theyll be throwin em out of the stockade
they need every man they can get
he picks up the sheet of paper with the re enlistment blues written out on it starts to fold it
desperation is reflected on almas face she turns to gorgette as if pleading for aid your sidell open up and theyll find out it was you who killed that soldier
prew shakes his head as if obsessed by only one thought
once i report in to the compny ill be all right
once i get there
i gotta get back but youll never make it
theres mps all over ill make it
ill go along the back roads
theyll let me in the west gate theyll know im a he puts the folded piece of paper in his pocket and starts for the door
stay till morning
prew glances at alma incredulously
she sobs suddenly violently
maybe if you stayed till morning youd change your mind
she throws her arms around him clings to him
dont go prew
ill do whatever you want
well figure out a way to get to the states together
we can even get married
if you go i wont see you any more
i know it
prew holds her closely for a moment then moves her away from him
he turns toward the door
tears turning to what do you want to go back to the army for
what did the army ever do for you
besides treat you like scum and give you one awful going over and get your friend killed
what do you want to go back to that for
prew frowns as if hes not sure he heard correctly
what do i want to go back for
im a soljer
from the regular army
a thirty year man
a thirty year man
with only twenty six years to go
he opens the door quickly and slips into the darkness
moving shot jeep with three mps the night is inky black except for a little moonlight and the
dimmed headlights of the jeep
camera shoots past driver onto the highway as the jeep moves slowly along
the two other mps clutch thompson guns try to scan the dark countryside
they say they seen parachutists land up in the mountains
i aint worried about them
sabatoors is what worries me
theys the creepy ones
walkin around just like ordinary civilians
i betcha they operatin all over these islands
the headlights pass along the road as the jeep moves on out of sight
as its sound fades we hear prews heavy breathing are barely able to distinguish his figure in the darkness
he is crouched watching the car go down the highway
we hear his thoughts
the voice is labored and agonized
ony across the golf course
gotta be care
gotta sweat it out
he groans puts his hand to his side
in the feeble light from the moon we see blood on his shirt and hand
he looks up and down the road
its clear now
gotta get home
still crouched prew starts across the road
we see nothing but the strip of road then prew s figure is visible bent low weaving a little
as he approaches the camera he is taught square in the twin beams of dimmed headlights which flash on from the side of the road
now we see that a jeep is parked near camera heading in the opposite direction from the jeep which passed before
it is also manned by three mps
there is a startled cry from prew
prew starts to run back across the road
a white spotlight flashes on its harsh brilliant light following him
prew slips to one knee
looking toward the jeep blinded by the blazing light
he has the appearance of a terrified animal
there is a wildness a senselessness about him
the blotch of blood oozes and spreads over his shirt
he picks up a rock from the road
prew rises staggers away from the jeep
prew flings the rock desperately toward the lights
there is a crash of glass and one headlight winks off
prew runs across the road and onto the golf course
the motor starts the jeep moves out from its hiding place and starts across the golf course
prew in a skirmishers zigzag is trying to elude the spotlight
he is about twenty yards in front of the jeep
he heads for a high sandtrap
the spot is full on him as he reaches the lip of the trap
he turns yells something back at the jeep
it is barely heard over the sound of the jeep
im a soljer
that guy aint no soljer he dint standing on the lip of the trap the jeep bearing down on him
he turns starts to dive into the trap
a blast of gunfire from the jeep hits him
he falls sideways into the trap rolls over on his back the jeep moves into the shot crawls half way over the trap stops its spotlight pouring down on prew
his eyes are open looking up to the sky
camera shoots down to prew from top of trap
a portion of the jeep is in shot but we are not able to see the mps
mps voice contd maybe he was a soljer i dint mean to kill him i dint mean it guys you know we got orders shut up
the voices are lost as camera moves slowly down toward prews open eyes
we hear his thoughts on the sound track clear and fast at first and slow and almost inaudible as the camera sweat it out and sweat it out and wait
and wait and wait for it
and now its here
gotta see to do it well
gotta do it well
wont take long
camera moves closer to closeup of prews open eyes
just a little more now
gotta do it good
itll be over
a man has
got to have some place
prews eyes close
the screen goes black
there is no sound as the screen remains black for several beats
they are looking down to camera which shoots up as if from point of view of prews body in the sand trap
the dimmed headlights of two jeeps illuminates them
warden is fighting to control his emotion to remain the professional soldier
the lieutenant colonel is disturbed but kindly
wheres your company commander
hes at headquarters sir
im the first sergeant
did you know this man personally
they are standing on the lip of the sandtrap
the hoods of the jeeps that chased prew and the second jeep are just behind them in shot
he didnt have any regular identification
but they found a card on him with his name holds card close to seems to be a membership in a club
the new congress club
the lieutenant colonel hands the card to warden
ill turn this over to you
and these other things that were on him
this he unfolds a sheet of paper holds it to the headlight
he and warden squint at it
re enlistment blues is written at the top
the stanzas of the song are beneath the heading
seems to be acme sort of poem
very softly so distant that we can only distinguish a word or two now and then we hear the voices of clark anderson and prew singing the re enlistment blues
the plaintive melody continues under the rest of the scene
whatever it is
he holds prew s bugle mouthpiece up to the light gives it to warden
warden holds it in his hand stares at it
under the re enlistment blues even softer farther away we now hear prews bugle blowing taps
it continues with the song to the end of the scene
its the mouthpiece of a bugle
the lieutenant colonel looks at warden closely
are you all right sergeant
was this man a friend of yours
warden speaks very formally
sir this man was a good soldier
he loved the army moren any soljer i ever knew
i would like to make a formal request that this body be buried in the armys permanent cemetery at schofield barracks
i believe i can attend to that for you
thank you sir
im sorry sergeant
the lieutenant colonel walks off
including prews body in the shot as warden looks down at it
he looks at it for several moments
the taps is just coming to an end
warden speaks very quietly
i hardly knew the guy
taps and the re enlistment blues are swept away by the lush strains of aloha oe
the hawaiian music continues through the scene
she is looking back at the city
around her neck is a garland of leis
its very beautiful isnt it
she turns and camera pans to include alma in shot standing beside karen
she is dressed in black quite severely
i think its the most beautiful place i ever saw in my lire
no one would know there was a war from out here
karen takes off her leis begins tossing them over the rail
theres a legend
if they float in toward shore youll come back some day
if they float out to sea you wont
i wont come back
i had to get away from here
you see my fiance was killed on december seventh
oh i am sorry
quickly as if rehearsed he was a bomber pilot
he tried to taxi his plane off the apron and the japs made a direct hit on it
maybe you read about it in the papers
they awarded him a silver star
they sent it to his mother
she wrote me she wanted me to have it
tossing the last of leis thats very fine of her
