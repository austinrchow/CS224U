written by max landis based on a story by josh trank and max landis cut to indicate time lapses within a scene the room is dingy
the camera sits on the bed on its side facing the door
we can hear someone moving around off screen
the door handle clicks someones trying it
then suddenly loud pounding on the door
andrews voice is scratchy and prone to cracking
he speaks with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety
what do you want im getting ready for school why is the door locked unlock this fucking door right now
the bed stirs as andrew sits down
i said unlock this door

detmer moving away from the door
sandra detmer gaunt and sickly is sat up in bed
andrews filming her
shes clearly very ill speaking in a weak rasp
andrew now holds the camera
will you say hi to the camera

the millions of people watching at home

ive been looking a little better yeah
oh yeah definitely

clark street is a slummy mess dead lawns potholes in the street in a downtrodden suburb of portland oregon
andrew carries the camera loosely at his side before getting into the passenger side of a car
in the drivers seat is matt garrety with messy hair
hes disaffected and more than a little cynical the reasoned demeanor of an unpretentious high school intellectual
i got you egg salad
oh yeah thanks

im filming everything
youre filming everything
for my mom
im trying to get custody of her from my dad
shes getting worse and hes not

well yeah to add context
andrew you are
a weird dude
did you ever read any auguste comte
what is that
hes this philosopher im reading
hes just like his whole thing is about being positive and like taking up for yourself
you should read him maybe it might make you feel you know improve your outlook
andrews getting out of the car but then ducks back in to see matt lighting a pipe
are you not coming in
im gonna blaze a little first yeah
youre going to miss first period matt turns on the radio loud
andrews filming himself putting stuff in his locker and does a quick sweep of the crowded school hallway
this is my school i guess
this is the hallway vote kaz
a girl suddenly approaches awkwardly handing andrew a flyer
vote steve kazinsky for senior class president
yeah every vote counts
andrew films the flyer for a moment brightly colored and featuring a picture of a smiling steve kazinsky before something yanks the camera away
for the first time we see andrew detmer pale awkward and gangly with long stringy hair and thin scraggly beard
he looks anxious if not afraid
yo this camera is a piece of shit
its like from or some shit
wayne big and hateable in his ed hardy t shirt appears wrapping his arm roughly around andrew
hey how do i look
starts muscle posing like this

wayne turns and knocks everything out of andrews locker
bryce starts to walk away with the camera
hey bryce come on give it back the camera is set down on the ground and then abruptly kicked back to andrew
he picks it up checking on it
quietly sad oh come on
a view from the bleachers as the soccer team practices
the cheerleaders are practicing too
we cut a different view lower
this is where i eat lunch out here on the bleachers
the cameras next to andrew as hes eating down on the bench
a cheerleader approaches

andrew turns off the camera
andrews filming from the passenger seat

andrew is filming as he walks along towards his house
hey what you doing
hey nice camera bitch gimme your fuckin camera
the camera pans up to reveal howard and costly moron hoodlums along with several friends over by a car on the other side of the road drinking forties
hey dont film me nigga dont film me
hey fuck off you better run to your house bitch
run to your house and lock the door
andrew just stands there filming them
howard hurls his forty at andrew who doesnt move it shatters very near to him
the fuck fuck you faggot howard quickly starts crossing the street and andrew turns and runs back towards his house
the camera lays on andrews bed again filming the room
andrew is on his laptop at a desk working
im uploading what i shot today
you have to keep a back up you know
the door suddenly opens revealing mr
adrian detmer s andrews father
he doesnt look as white trash as youd expect
andrew looks up at him and then goes back to working
detmer goes over to andrew and slaps him out of his chair
when i say open this door you open this fucking door
detmer leaves slamming the door on his way out
andrew sits on the floor in silence
were in matts car driving on a dark dirt road past an old fence and rusted out farm equipment
are you sure its here
beat are you sure its here this all looks closed its here calm down
we can faintly hear party music
cars are parked outside a big abandoned barn as matt and andrew approach
we see christmas lights strung up and theres clearly a party going on inside the barn
kids are milling about outside too drinking fucking around
hey dude dont follow me around all night
dont follow me around all night okay
what am i supposed to do
i thought you said you didnt want to go alone
talk to people
have a beer i dont know
andrew skulks around the party which is clearly in full swing
lots of bad footage of people talking drinking girls dancing sexy guys joking around
andrew is silent and detached just filming
he sees a girl casey letter filming as well
they shout over the music
hey what are you filming for
oh i dont just filming
im filming for my blog
i have a video blog
why are you filming
andrew simply backs away
more footage of the party
austin in an ed hardy shirt comes out of nowhere
hes clearly a little drunk
hey were you filming my girlfriend

no i wasnt filming anyone specific just filming the party
beat okay good because i dont wanna have to beat your ass

dont get smart okay im being nice here
im being nice to you
beat say okay
okay cause i know you were filming my girlfriend dancing
i should break your fucking nose you know that
you know that i should beat your ass right now but im trying to be nice
austin abruptly throws his beer on andrew getting some on the camera and then spits on him
andrew backs up shocked lowering the camera
andrews out alone in a field now furiously cleaning the lens of the camera obstructing our view
cut to a few moments later the camera now resting in his lap or on the ground
we can see the barn the party still going on
after a few moments we can faintly hear andrew crying
loud sudden are you andrew
startled what are you andrew with the camera
beat matts cousin matt said you had a camera
the camera is picked up to reveal steve kaz kazinksy approachably handsome and in great shape with an easygoing instantly likeable charisma
hes a little drunk and giddy
dude are you okay
im steve kazinsky no i know
everybody knows who you are
haha yes that is true
listen come on bring the camera
i dont come on
steve starts off but andrew hesitates
i dont dude come on we found something
steve is walking ahead in the field of tall grass toward woods
its rather dark
look i dont think were supposed to is there a light on that
on your camera
oh i dont hm i dont know the camera goes down for a moment while andrew futzes with it
the light clicks on illuminating steve
theyve reached the woods and steve is climbing over the remains of a fence
the light bounces around wildly
what were you guys doing out here
this is way out me and your cousin were blazing a little
matts out here
a bunch of people were out here but i think theyve all gone back now cause were like obsessed with the thing
theyre in the woods now thick and dizzying
its near silent but their feet crushing the fall leaves on the ground
steve walks out ahead
andrew detmer thats right
i remember you from homeroom freshman year
you remember that
yeah i have a memory for faces
im gonna go into politics which is ironic because im soooo fucking high right now probably shouldnt be letting you videotape this im gonna be so rich when youre president
you have no idea yeah video footage of me luring you into the woods for gay sex wait hey hey matt is this it
the camera turns to reveal matt standing next to some kind of craggy hole in the ground at the base of a hill in the woods
its big but the darkness beyond is impenetrable to the camera
it looks like a big black spot
there we go
there it is
andrew and steve are now down with matt by the hole
andrew is keeping the camera fixed squarely on the murky blackness nervous
where is everybody
they all left
were not supposed to be out here
is it still making the sound
did you tell andrew
oh andrew its making a sound here listen
guys youve got to get really close to hear it
andrew takes a tentative step towards the hole
guys just dont like dont push me or do anything like that
youve got to go closer
like almost inside it
theres a beat
were not going to push you we just wanna get it on tape
andrew moves towards the hole
even with nightvision its completely dark in there
do you hear it
its like whispering
ooooh shiiiiit that is so fucking creepy
andrew turns the camera back to matt and steve
what is that
we didnt dig the hole man
is the sound on the camera
i dont know probably
i mean its its kinda loud right
matt looks to steve
do you guys wanna go in and have a look or what no i dont i mean i wont do th hold your nose
steve suddenly goes right into the hole vanishing into the darkness
hey wait faintly come on
steve come on we dont know if its stable in there its probably just the wind we should andrew abruptly goes into the cave
andrew hey come on
its almost pitch black but we can hear andrew breathing
its claustrophobic in here
the camera searches around but the walls are tight in here and low
hello suddenly appearing aah
im right here
does it go down much deeper or yeah really far
its not a cave its like a tunnel do you hear how loud thats getting
do you think it could be like wind or come on man
then what do you think it is
i dont believe in ghosts
who said anything about ghosts
steve laughs and turns going back into the darkness
matts face is suddenly in front of the camera
shouldnt have come in here
steves up ahead at first i thought this was a solutional cave but now
i dunno its like a lava tube or something
i dont know what youre talking about
look at the walls
look at how smooth they are
its just straight shot down i mean we mustve already gone forty or fifty feet dont talk about it youre making me nervous
you ever hear of platos allegory of the cave
the cave is even tighter now
the light flickers some kind of electrical disturbance then goes out completely we hear andrew curse fumbling with it and the nightvision mode comes on
the nightvision is scrambling badly
all the forms are distorted and then can you believe this this is nuts the nightvision is turned off revealing matt
theyve come into a larger chamber in the cave one somehow lit from within the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise glow
they speak loudly clearly talking over something we cant hear
is that is that showing up on the camera
i dont wanna film it its messing with the camera matt forcibly turns the camera to reveal steve standing next to some kind of massive crystalline rock structure growing from
or maybe embedded in the wall
around it and him float wispy little clouds of light turquoise and beautiful
steve is clearly entranced sweeping his hands through the light
we see matt now also surrounded by the little aurora borealis like clouds touch one it comes apart in a silent little explosion of light beautiful
maybe we shouldnt
a light cloud passes in front of andrew and we sees his hand to extend to touch it
the subsequent little light burst badly warps the camera clearly permanent damage
andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure viewed up close its almost arachnid organic somehow
the light clouds have turned yellow
matt is practically inside the structure pressing it with his palms
changes color see
it must be reacting to the heat some kind of exothermic reaction what
i cant hear you over the you know make it change again
this is awesome
matt presses with his palms
theres a low sustained hiss as the light clouds turn an angry shade of red
a stream of them is released from beneath the structure
the camera jerks suddenly revealing steve whos clutching his ears
blood has begun to rapidly pour out of his eyes ears mouth and nose and he buckles forwards the camera spins wildly and we see matt seemingly flung out of
the crystalline structure
it pulses and seems to rapidly blossom and spread apart revealing a blinding light within which explodes outward we can suddenly hear an overwhelming choir of voices and the camera
sent rocketing backwards flipping backwards up the tunnel the camera turns on from the quality of the picture its immediately evident that this is a newer better camera
its on a tripod and matt stands across a well manicured backyard his hair is a little different time has passed
okay ball test
a baseball comes flying in from behind the camera nailing matt in the face he drops like a rock
steve comes in from off camera to help matt laughing we can hear andrew laughing behind the camera too
im sorry oh shit im sorry now its steve who stands on the yard
a baseball comes in from off camera slower
it comes down towards steve but at the last second makes a bizarre impossible course correction flies up and hits steve in the matt rushes on doing a victory lap
one hand holding an ice pack to his face
again we hear andrew laughing
andrews out across the yard
he looks a little better hes gotten rid of the ridiculous nerd beard and his hair is a little better kept
in flies the baseball
it abruptly stops in the air a foot and a half from andrews face
steve and matt let out a cheer and the camera is yanked off the tripod taken to show a closer view of the impossibly suspended baseball and andrew
andrew smiles and points to the suspended ball
a trickle of blood comes out of his nose
the cameras on a tripod up on the back porch filming andrew steve and matt standing a triangle
they are playing catch
the ball simply flies from guy to guy
they drop it a few times in some cuts but shout encouragement and are clearly having a good time
finally they get the ball going extremely fast
matt looks up
is matt gets nailed in the balls and drops as steve and andrew rush to him laughing
in the penis the penis i thought i heard my dad
ughhh steve is very intently using his newfound powers to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich knife shakily moving over bread
the camera is set down on the counter matt and andrew watching
the trick is to pretend like its on a plate
you get it on the plate and then you wrap the plate around it and you can move it however you want
ive been pretending i was like holding it in a fist like a floating hand
plates easier for me
guys check it out
steve has a glob of jelly and a glob of peanut butter floating freely
they slap together and then down onto the bread which slaps closed
notices his bloody nose shit shit matts room is covered in band posters kind of a mess
matts sitting on the floor by a desk slowly assembling a lego set with his telekinetic abilities
andrews filming from the bed where hes laying down
try to imagine that your squeezing the entire piece in your hand
thats what im doing its just its hard
youre better at this than me you do it
andrew points at the lego set and it flies together
wowed laughing dude holy shit
andrew and matt are laughing as steve enters holding out his cell phone
guys listen listen
steve puts his voice mail on speaker
samantha pezon sounds a bit frustrated
i know youre over at that guy matts house right now okay cause they said you didnt show up for soccer practice but you said the only reason you couldnt
come see bound by love with me was because of soccer practice so
you know i just i dont know what to think
i feel like we never hang out anymore youve just been hanging out with those two guys for the last like three weeks and i
ugh call me back
what would you suggest as like a course of action for me here
why are you asking us for advice on girls
because were his mistress
steve is driving andrew home
new cameras working out for you thats good
i have to admit though i dont understand the filming thing
i told you its just my thing for right now
you dont feel like its a little weird
like it puts a barrier between you and everything
maybe i want a barrier
i respect that
my dad is actually a fireman or was i dont know
he got injured like two years ago and now they just pay him out of like insurance
he doesnt do anything i mean he goes out during the day but i dont know where
he drinks a lot
so how do you pay for your shit
i do computer repair and stuff
i actually make a lot of money
what about your mom
my mom has spinal meningitis shes she cant work or anything and the insurance doesnt cover all of her medicine so a lot of my money has to go into
i figure if i get enough on camera maybe i can i dunno get custody of her or something
steve mulls this over
ive actually been having some problems with my parents too
nothing like yours though
not never mind
theres a long beat
theyve just been fighting a lot
i think my mom is cheating on my dad
im actually yeah im sure my mom is cheating on my dad
how i just you know i saw some stuff
its weird you dont think about your parents as like
people or whatever
i dont know
the two guys drive in silence
dont tell anybody about that haha no of course no way
we can hear shouting from elsewhere in the house useless bitch carry your ass long enough etc
andrew reaches over and turns off the camera
matt andrew and steve are eating lunch on the bleachers
see last night alone i got my whole bed off the ground
yeah i was doing weights too
weights like free weights a barbell
i got up to two hundred pounds before i bled
so its yeah this is my theory its like a vagina
like its elastic but if you stretch it too far too quick itll tear ew and thats why were getting better
were loosening up
couldnt that metaphor just be for any muscle in the human body like working out or no i like braingina
braingina is the shiiiiit
steve floats up a bunch of chips from his bag and then rapid fires them into his mouth
i think its time we took this out of the backyard
matt and steve look confused
steve is driving matts shotgun andrews filming from the back
if anyone criticizes you just call them a hater
its like calling someone a racist theyll just drop whatever theyre complaining about and be like im not a hater
nobody wants to be a hater
matt and steve are walking in andrew lagging behind filming
just stay back a little ways yeah i got it
the guys are trying to stay out of sight looking down an aisle where shoppers stand
that girl with the cart
a frumpy woman with a shopping cart suddenly starts pulling on the cart
it suddenly breaks away from her and goes careening down the aisle by itself her chasing after it
we can hear the guys cracking up trying to stay quiet
shes chasing shes chasing it toy aisle
a toddler is looking at teddy bears
i got this
one of the teddy bears suddenly comes to life waving at the little boy
the little boy is wowed
the teddy bear suddenly takes off and flies through the air
again the stifled laughter
oh my god andrew look andrew pans up to reveal a woman at the end of the aisle she saw everything and is looking around wide eyed
theyre by the check out
see that guy chewing gum
camera finds the guy got him
im gonna get the gum right out of his mouth watch this
theres suddenly a little air ripple in front of the mans mouth and hes yanked face first into the gum and candy rack which all crashes apart
the guys all crack up and start running
laughing guys why are we running
we dont need to run we dont need to run
matt sits on the hood of a car
he and andrew are flinging rocks with their powers
that was a good one you got that one far

the car the woman parked shakily lifts off and immediately dips right
steve steve steve got it got it
silence and we watch as the car gets to about twelve feet in the air makes a full degree rotation and then wobbles through the air over to a spot
several spaces away and then sets down neatly in place
blood matt is sitting against the car with a wad of kleenex on his nose soaked with blood
steve is leaning nearby with a brown paper napkin
beat my braingina is having like a
yeah you got some from your ears too
youve gotta start working it out more matt
yeah man in between my yoga
you just need focus matt
youre lucky you got the kleenex im stuck with the taco bell wrapper
andrew holds out said wrapper in front of the camera
thats like at least twice as much blood as i usually see on a taco bell wrapper
the camera moves around to show the woman returning to the space where her car was parked
she stops baffled and looks around
we hear the guys stifle laughter
she notices her car parked up ahead and walks over to it looking around
andrew tries to get a better angle and she notices him and stares
were beat mormons
the woman stares a moment longer and goes to her car
matts driving steves shotgun andrew filming from the back
sfucking insane we just changed her life
we did her face i cant get her face out of my head
that was fucking great
i mean this just gives me so many ideas already stuff we could do theres honking from outside
oh come on what is this

matt rolls down the window and gives the signal to pass
can you fucking believe this guy
hes just some asshole redneck look at him
hes fucking with us
they are driving out over a bridge in the woods
i dont know what to do what should i laughing here take the camera take the camera
he hands off the camera to steve now we see andrew sitting in the back seat
behind him through the back window we can see a pick up truck honking way too close
andrew flicks his hand at the truck
the effect is instantaneous the front of the truck caves in like it just i
the camera is being held loosely at steves side everythings upside down and we cant see anything but can hear the guys are clearly freaked out
what the fuck did you do man what the fuck i didnt mean to i didnt
whats wrong with you look at this fuck
is he still in there
if hes in there we have to get him out guys just calm down im sorry okay fuck that take your fucking camera
the camera is shoved to andrews chest and lingers there a moment before he brings it up to show a view off the bridge the truck is already sinking in
the water fifteen or so feet below
we tilt up to see steve taking off his jacket
you dont have to i mean i can andrew raises out a hand trying to telekinetically lift the car
it rattles and then andrew groans in pain
andrew just stop just stop doing things
steve dives off the side of the bridge
andrew films him for a moment swimming to the car
andrews filming matt who looks angry as he drives very quickly
are you mad
stop just stop
matt and andrew pull up to see steve dragging the redneck asshole out of the water
they hurry out of the car
steve has the guy on the shore
hes dazed and bleeding

steve just stares directly at andrew
andrew pans to reveal matt on a cell phone

the cops and an ambulance have arrived
an officer is talking to matt steve and andrew the camera is held low

the camera shuts off
matt looks furious while steve just looks uncomfortable and freaked out
matts car is parked nearby
i dont see how you guys can be so angry you dont see how we can be angry

if we keep going and getting stronger we need rules
we need rules
beat damn it andrew turn off the cam its morning
the camera lays on the bed
andrew can be heard breathing
the camera moves and is picked up following a spider as it moves across the floor
it crawls up onto the side of the bed then onto the sheets
andrews finger points at it
the spider is telekinetically lifted into the air
it hangs struggling there for a moment then becomes rigid
he spreads his fingers and the spider abruptly separates into all of its component parts
they stop moving hanging lifeless
andrews home phone rings and he drops the spider
from downstairs andrew
answer the fucking phone
andrews filming matt from shotgun
did he say what it was about
when he called what did he say
are you still mad at me
im not mad
beat you seem mad
power corrupts is all im saying man
what does that even mean
i just mean that we have to think about things more now okay
we cant just do things we have to think first
its just nah nevermind were here
the house is big and nice somewhat isolated
matt is walking up ahead of andrew to the door
matt stops and both matt and andrew look around
where are you
steve is atop a power line pole thirty feet in the air
andrew and matt look up at him from the ground
just try it its easy
that doesnt look easy
you throw yourself at the ground
you just fall and catch yourself and then its easy i swear
dont try to jump or youll flip yourself
matt hurls himself at the ground wham
cut and again wham
cut and this time he flips himself bam wham
let me try yeah
im done for now
matts now holding the camera showing andrew
he checks the street for cars
no cars no cars go
andrew throws himself forward
and stops hanging in mid air
matt moves in for a closer look at floating andrew and gives a glance up at steve whos cheering on the telephone pole
at first its not clear what were looking at just blue sky
wind is very loud
the camera pans down to reveal were five thousand feet in the air in a clearing between two larger cloudbanks
the camera pans all the way down to show andrews dangling feet and below them the impossibly far drop
we can hear andrew laugh
we can see steve and matt nearby now wearing winter coats and hats to keep warm
theyre playing catch with a football
steve tosses it to andrew who actually goes into a short dive to catch it
he looks up to see steve and matt distantly cheering and waving their approval
steves holding the camera filming andrew attempting a few fancy moves but hes a clumsy flier
matt does a few neater tricks in some clips
hey matt youre finally good at something
i said youre an idiot
matt gives the thumbs up and steve laughs
its about aerodynamics
if i put a barrier just in front of me i can go way faster cause it cuts wind resistance
i cant hear a damn thing youre saying
steve and matt are seen flying around steve further away near a large cloud bank
matt is using his abilities to shape cloud fluff into an m
there is a humming rattling sound slightly audible even over the deafening wind
guys do you hear that
neither of the guys can hear him
steve however stops in the distance looking around
he shouts something inaudible
i cant hear you
steve pantomimes pointing at his ear and shrugging
a boeing blows out of the cloudbank behind steve
hes spun like a top in its wake and drops like a rock
suddenly were launched downwards and after a moment the camera disconnects from andrew and we see him zooming ahead
the camera in free fall spins wildly then suddenly it swims through the air dizzily and lands relatively gently in some tall grass
less than a second later andrew and steve come falling down into the grass and roll roughly splitting apart
they lay there breathing hard
andrew sits up coughing his eyes nose and mouth bleeding
steve suddenly leaps up
steve grabs andrew shaking and hugging him
you saved my life dude
andrew you saved my fucking life
is that holy shit is that the camera
you caught me exhausted y yeah matt touches down behind them frantic
what happened are you ahhhhh
steve joy tackles matt to the ground
laughing what the hell what the hell andrew laughing tiredly rolls over and grabs the camera
theyre all standing in the field steve is still wigging out
this is what people have wanted forever since like caveman times
do you understand i mean do you jesus christ i cant even everything is fucking great
i can fly
matt listen just say it
i can fly
shout it out man
realizes it feels good matt stands shouting out at the field
andrew cheers from behind the camera and steve laughs
steve matt and andrew are sitting around the pool outside of steves house empty beers are all around

steve and andrew cheer and matt takes a bow
the guys have broken open glowsticks and steve is filming as andrew and matt manipulate snakes of the glowing fluid at each other its beautiful
we cut between three sing alongs shake that by nate dogg and eminem which andrew protests too as he doesnt know the lyrics how you remind me by nickelback and
macho man by the village people
the guys are in that sleepy mode now
andrews filming but not really focusing on anything
matts sprawled out on a couch opposite him
steves in a chair nearby

lights coming from the tv
the camera is laying haphazardly on andrew
theyre all nearly asleep drowsy drunk
hey guys are you up

theres a silence
time has passed maybe two weeks

steve is filming andrew and matt across the table

a group of kids are playing screamo music

a girl is singing
casey the girl with the videoblog from the barn party is doing hip hop booty dancing
the camera lingers on her
its a few minutes later
techno syndrome mortal kombat
begins to play
theres a beat and then steve in a tuxedo rushes out onto stage
the applause is deafening girls screaming etc
he raises his hands for silence and then presents andrew also in a tuxedo
mixed reaction from the crowd
andrews carrying a deck of cards he fumbles them they spill onto the floor
audience laughter steve throws up his arms in exasperation
andrew shrugs and all the cards leap back up into his hands
theres a beat and then the audience goes apeshit
andrew is juggling six balls at once
steve is drinking a soda and offers andrew the soda
andrew is annoyed
steve pantomimes joy at not having to give up his soda
andrew stops juggling leaving all the balls hanging in the air and snatches away steves soda
steve lunges after him and gets back his soda only to have all the balls drop out of the air and hit him
the audience is losing their freaking minds
people around matt are buzzing about how awesome it is
andrew is transporting buckets of water across the stage spilling water everywhere
steve is pantomiming anger at the shoddy job hes doing
andrew pantomimes well you try
steve tries but trips and falls sending the contents of the bucket flying out over the audience only for it to seemingly rewind back into the bucket
the place goes berzerk
steve and andrew take their bows to overwhelming cheers separately
andrew bows again and people freak out
we hear matt cheering behind the camera
andrews filming from shotgun

we can hear it raining hard outside
the camera is laying on its side on the floor and turns on when andrew fumbles with it
theres screaming from downstairs long and low real pain sounds
andrew drops the camera and rushes out the door
the camera lays on the floor
faintly mom its going to be okay okay
just try to get through its going to be okay
detmer enters and notices the camera
he reaches down and picks it up
in the squalid living room of the detmer residence
the camera is being held off at an angle by mr
detmer as andrew tries to get it back
it moves around a bit so andrew and his father are both on off screen

andrew backhands detmer hard flooring him
andrew turns and picks up the camera leveling it coolly on his father as he tries to stand
andrews arm snakes out and grabs detmer by his throat lifting him easily and slamming him against the wall
i cant cant move i could crush you
you know get off let me go youre that i can fucking crush hurting me andrew turns and flings mr
detmer into the sofa which flips on the impact
we can hear andrews gasping sobs panicked as he turns runs out of the house and launches into the
andrews just below the clouds massive dark and ominous above him
its clearly not safe rain and wind whipping his body lightning crackling inside the clouds
we can hear him breathing hard
he touches the bottom of a cloud and gets a powerful electric shock forcing him to back off a tiny bit
the camera turns showing steve in a rainslicker flying up to meet andrew
we have to get down from here right now andrew

yeah yes i dont know what im doing itll be fine
do you hear that
of the sky
the boom of thunder is deafening
for a moment all we can see is the stormscape and then we hear andrews rushed panicked breathing
its a gray dark day
a funeral is in progress were filming from within the mourning party
a large picture of steve is on a stand as the priest reads a eulogy
andrews camera movements are rigid again tight and confined back to how they were when we first started
we see steves mother and father
his mother is sobbing
his father simply looks shellshocked staring at the casket
steves mother leans on his father and he pushes her away
theres samantha crying uncontrollably
the camera passes matt
whos staring directly at us
andrew walks along in the cemetary filming tombstones
what are you doing
filming graves i dont get it
the camera looks up at matt
hes keeping his distance
youre not returning my calls why arent you returning my calls
ive been busy
no you havent
why arent you returning my calls
turn off the camera
turn off the camera
i had a missed call from you that morning
and from steve
i listened to your voicemail
no voicemail from steve
i was upset
long beat how do you get struck by lightning during a storm with no recorded lightning strikes
waits nothing you can look that up online you know they keep track of it
i looked it up
and they find him out in a field why would steve go out in the middle of a field during a lightning storm
the camera shifts a little
i dont know what
i dont know no no you do know you do know i think you do know
what happened andrew

i dont believe you i want you to put the fucking camera down

put it down put it down andrew please put it down turn it off put the fucking
matt very upset suddenly advances on andrew trying to pull the camera away
hes suddenly shoved backwards matt recovers himself before he falls staring at andrew
the camera hangs limply for a moment
breaking down a little what did you do andrew
what am i supposed to do
who am i supposed to tell about this man
who do i tell
i mean i dont i dont know how im supposed to why wont you just tell me what happened
the camera and andrew suddenly launch into the air rocketing away from matt
the camera is on andrews dresser near his mirror
andrew suddenly appears holding a kitchen knife
addressing the camera wanted to show you what i was talking about
andrew takes the camera and angles it down at his arm
he takes the kitchen knife and presses the tip into the flesh of his wrist
he drags the blade down hard all the way to his elbow
but no cut appears
he then violently jabs himself several times
but no penetration
see its i put a little sheet between myself and the knife and the barrier the sheet is too strong
the knife cant cut it
i mean like what im saying is if i concentrate i cant be hurt
i cant be injured
because of the little sheet
andrew sits alone on the bleachers
the cheerleaders are practicing
the camera zooms in on samantha
she sits alone on the sidelines watching numbly
andrew is putting his stuff away in his locker
hes suddenly shoved into the locker roughly
the camera turns revealing wayne walking away
the camera scans the mostly empty hallway quickly then goes back to wayne now almost twenty feet away
what you got a probl one of andrews hands flicks out and waynes mouth suddenly gushes blood
wayne screams falling and is immediately tended to by other students
andrew has laid out three small bloody objects on the back of the toilet and presents each one to the camera one by one
theyre waynes bloody teeth
see this one i got clean cause i did a little lasso around the root but these two theyre broken cause i think i pulled them from the middle
matt was always better at the little the intricate stuff he got good at that
see how broken it is ugh sloppy
mike fernandez s serious but warm sits across the desk from andrew
the concern in his voice is very real
could you put the camera away
no im filming this
i film everything
i understand that things have been very hard for you recently andrew but the camera kind of it alienates a little you know
what did you want to talk about
beat theres concern for your grades andrew
and as far as i know youve yet to apply to any colleges so its not doable
financially theyre not i mean my dad didnt go to college either
well yes but i still think its worth thinking about
there are three different community colleges locally that offer great programs for i dont need college mr
beat i think thats a very close minded attitude andrew
i know that you come from a difficult background and i know how horrible the pain can be when you lose a friend
but i dont think you should let this make you lose hope
i mean this is your future
you dont want to compromise your future
long beat andrew
the camera is sitting on the floor
we can hear screaming from downstairs
andrew picks up the camera and goes to the mirror filming himself filming
after a beat he steps out from behind the camera leaving it hanging in the air
he stands looking at himself and then the camera
the camera turns to face andrew
he doesnt look good but gives a weak smile
were peeking in through the door
we can see sandra detmer writhing around in agony in the bed moaning in pain
she lets out a long scream and then seems to notice us watching
richard is that you
richard you have to let me have my medicine i cant
who is that
look please come in here i need help to turn over
it hurts please andrew you have to tell your father
tell your father to get my medicine
sandra her eyes closed in pain is lifted and rolled onto her side
thank you andrew
was that you
did you the door closes
the junkyard is filled with junked cars metal garbage old equipment
the camera sits awkwardly on the hood of a wrecked car as andrew fidgets to get it mounted
the area is lit by lights from the main building not too far away but you can tell hes not supposed to be in here
andrew moves out in front of the camera
he telekinetically pulls an old car forward and lifts it easily
he moves it left moves it right rolls it sets it back down
andrew is sitting resting tired
he speaks directly to the camera
ive been doing a lot of reading like you know online about evolution and the way it works and you know natural selection
cut the strongest animals will always survive and theyre the ones that you know will prosper or grow and survive by feeding on the smaller animals
and as humans we see theres
uh cut theres this thing called an apex predator and basically what that is the most powerful predator in an ecosystem
and humans you know were the apex predator because theres nothing that preys on us cause of weapons and stuff
but if something could i bet it would
cut i mean what im trying to say is a lion doesnt feel guilty when it kills a gazelle
you dont feel guilty when you squash a fly you know i think that means something
i think it really means something
andrews back out with the car
he lifts it again then makes a quick squeezing motion
as he does this the car violently compresses down to the size of a basketball
andrew flings the ball of metal into a scrap pile which collapses loudly
andrew falls down onto his butt a little exhausted but as he gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog which bites him twice before hes able to
fling it off
the dog recovers and rushes andrew who raises a hand blasting the dog across the yard killing it instantly
andrew turns and looks at the camera and it turns off
everything is crisper cleaner brighter
were looking at the door to a bathroom only a crack open
its pushed open revealing matt shirtless brushing his teeth
casey runs up and hugs matt from behind startling him
matt is cooking hes got four different things on the stove
howd the interviews go
i told you how the interviews went

running away theyre at the breakfast table
matts eating and casey filming is talking between bites

i am so sick of being filmed you have no idea casey no i know but im not going to use any of this

matts asleep in bed on a different day
caseys filming from next to him
whispering im filming you and you dont know

matt runs out ahead of the camera and does a little shuck and jive boxer dance
are you sure lets do it
casey raises a paintball gun out ahead of the camera
matts arm whips out impossible fast
he holds up the caught paintball
awed holy shit matt
casey fires several more shots matt catches them effortlessly then hurls them all into the air
mid air they all pop some of the paint landing on the camera and casey
laughing awed matt oh my god oh my god
its dark the camera turns on then the light revealing matt groggy half awake
i had that dream again
its like im

out in space
and stars are all around me and im zooming past them everything is really like three d i can see the shape of the stars
im looking for somewhere to sleep or something and i see earth and i go down to earth
i dont know just the main part is that im out and there are the stars and they just look like millions of little points of light
and steve is there
steve is there
yeah but he feels like hes not part of it
like hes there separately inside my head
andrew is there too
i dont know
im worried about andrew
beat slyly why dont you put the camera away
whats gonna happen to me if i put the camera away oh i think you know
i think you know whats going down
we could leave the camera on
matt advances on casey and the camera falls off to the side of the bed
we can hear her giggling which is abruptly muffled by kissing
the camera is aimed at steves tombstone
there are still flowers and memorials spread around
some are rotting
the camera moves around a little then back to steves tombstone
screaming from sandras bedroom
the heater rattling
the tv from downstairs
theres a knock on the window
the camera is picked up to reveal matt floating outside looking around nervously
after a moment andrew opens the window
matt stands fidgeting clearly uncomfortable as andrew films him
you havent been returning my calls so i thought id just
you know ambush
i just ive been getting you know bad vibes or whatever
andrew is silent
i know you stopped coming to school and my mom said you guys are having a lot of problems with money
im worried about you

im stronger than ever now
i can lift a whole car by myself

andrew im not gonna break your stupid fucking rules just fuck off and stay out of my life
matt stands staring at andrew
the camera fidgets uncomfortably
matt shakes his head and the camera follows him as he goes to the window gives andrew one last look and then rockets off into the sky
the camera sits in silence pointed at the window
the camera approaches the counter
hello how can i help you
im here to pick up a prescription for sandra detmer
um yes hold on
thats imuran baclofen glatiramer and vicodin
okay and the copay on that is
seven hundred and fifteen dollars eighty three cents

okay well hold it for you
andrew is filming out his window watching his father leave
his stereo plays david bowie
once his dads car is gone andrew sets down the camera on the dresser opposite the mirror and leaves the room
time passes and andrew reappears now dragging a crate
he opens it and pulls out his fathers firemans uniform
we do short space time cuts as he takes out the jacket looks at it and turns it inside out so that the metallic fireproof inner lining is exposed
ziggy stardust comes on andrews stereo
andrew wearing the jacket looks at himself in the mirror his back to the camera
he reaches down and picks something up looking at it then pulls it over his head
its a gas mask
he stands there staring at the surreal hard edged faceless figure in the mirror
adjusts the mask
then turns and whips out his hand the camera is abruptly yanked across the room
its a run down house in andrews neighborhood
the streetlights and the setting sun give everything light in yellow orange haze
howard costly and some other thugs are chilling on the porch laughing loudly smoking a blunt
they clearly havent noticed andrew whos filming from out by the street
he reaches down and picks up a rock then hurls it at the house
it flies up and breaks a window
costly howard and the thugs immediately mobilize swearing and posturing as they rapidly surround andrew
he doesnt react
you are about to get fucking stomped you know that right
you hear me son
come to my house its late i dont see any fucking police officers or some shit i dont know what you you think youre doing throwing shit at my house
no wait what the fuck
what the fuck are you dressed up like that for
are you high
lil andrews straight up tripping right now i dont even know ima give your ass a wake up call howard starts towards andrew who raises a hand out in front
of the camera
he makes the gun sign
oh you got a gat
i got a gat too bitch howard starts to pull a gun from the back of his pants
firing the finger gun bang
howards body abruptly folds backwards with a sickly loud chorus of cracks and then is flung aside
the thugs shocked dont have a second to react before andrew telekinetically blows one of them backwards sending him smashing headfirst through the windshield of his car
costly and the remaining thug start running and the remaining thugs legs suddenly flip up out from under him breaking bending and twisting like a rag doll before hes propelled
face first into the ground wham
andrew launches into the air coming down just in front of costly who skids to a halt
no no costly is shoved to the street and ground back and forth as though under the weight of a giant thumb leaving a glistening smear of clothes blood and
skin before he falls across the curb
we can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony but other than that the night is silent
andrew raises a hand and all of their wallets and loose money lift away from them flying to him
theres a beat and then andrew launches into the air
andrew sits under one of the red airplane spotter lights on one of the strut supports
the camera sits nearby watching the expressionless figure as it counts the money
theres a beat and he hangs his head
we can hear muffled noises of frustration from under the mask
something that sounds like a low angry scream
very suddenly he dives off the tower
a second later the camera is yanked after him zooming out into freefall
andrew holding the camera touches down just outside the gas station
he waits a beat and then starts to walk towards it
we transition to
black and white a slightly grainy feed with no audio
we watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figure in the coat and the gas mask holding the camera out in front of it strides past people
pumping gas into the station store
the wall mounted security camera shows us the whole store
andrew enters turning to the clerk behind the register who says something looking concerned
hes suddenly blown out of frame
after a beat the register rips itself free from the counter and floats over to andrew
andrew turns and walks out the register floating with him as he does a second clerk rushes out panicked yelling
he goes behind the counter and grabs a shotgun
andrew exits the gas station as does the clerk who yells raising the shotgun
andrew whips an arm out towards him and the clerk fires as hes hit by a wave of energy
the shotgun blast goes wild striking the stacked tanks of propane next to the garage
the effect is instantaneous a blinding white flash of fire envelopes the clerk and floors andrew the camera we look through jerking awkwardly the feed breaking down
the camera lays awkwardly on its side the distorted audio from its damaged microphone sudden and piercing
its been flung a good deal away from andrew who lays motionless burning
the clerk is dead and a nearby gas station customer is horribly injured and screaming
his gas pump lays on the ground pumping out gas onto the asphalt
andrew slowly shifts unable to move properly and forces himself to roll over
the fire on his body touches the fire on the asphalt and spreads lightning fast to the gas pump
the resulting explosion engulfs the entire station
the camera is spun violently out into the street the camera is color with crackly strange somewhat distorted audio
the image is a little blown out
andrew on a bed
his entire right side is absolutely scorched the flesh looks like bloody cracked paper blackened and red
the parts of him that are bandaged are already soaked through with blood
he is barely breathing hooked up to various machines
andrew is not going anywhere anytime soon
this is ensured by the handcuff on his left wrist
the machines beep
andrew doesnt move
the door opens and mr
detmer enters speaking to a police detective on the other side of the door
come down to the city cause his mothers all alone right now
shes got ms i had to leave her at the house all a fucking alone
i understand mr
jesus look at this
can i have a moment with my son
yeah i ill be outside the door yeah
the officer closes the door and mr
detmer goes and sits down in a chair next to the bed
he sits there staring at andrew clearly horrified and upset and buries his head in his hands
we speed up the recording and detmer just sits like that
after five minutes of speed up we slow down
i want you to apologize to me
andrew is comatose
i said i want you to apologize to me
i know you can hear me
so i want you to sit up and apologize to me
i want you to stop this bullshit right now
andrew is comatose
do you know how much this shit is going to cost me
do you know what youve done to your family
beat you dont even care do you
you just dont give a fuck youve got your fucking morphine dont you
theres a beat and then detmer suddenly slaps andrews burnt shoulder
andrew flinches badly and his pulse speeds up on the monitor
im not buying this shit you cant just play this off like a fucking slap game this is real
you really fucked me me and your mother you know that you little slap shit
andrew no longer flinches but the slaps leave red bleeding molten welts
detmer stands up clearly upset and takes a quick pace forward and back
goddamn it goddamn it
detmer goes to slap andrew again and andrews arm jerks up
detmer floats is telekinetically lifted into the air
he hangs screaming and struggling for a moment then becomes rigid
andrew spreads his fingers and his father abruptly separates into all of his component parts
they stop moving hanging lifeless then drop to the ground in a bloody mess
andrews eyes open revealing black red eightball hemorrhages and he seizes badly letting out a scream of agony and then another tearing at his iv
the police detectives rush the room reacting with horror to the gore that was andrews father
they barely have time to scream out when andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed and lets out an enormous concussive blast blowing apart everything in the room including
all of caseys family is present along with lots of little kids
everyones gathered around caseys little brother whos being presented with a birthday cake
matt looks happy
appy birthday to you
everyone lets out a cheer including casey but then she notices matt abruptly duck out
she follows him to the bathroom
where hes holding his nose which is bleeding badly
matt do you hear that how can you not hear that
in the background we can hear the house phone ring
then cell phones
matt what hap the singing how can you not hear that
somethings wrong okay somethings wrong with andrew or matt please okay youre scaring me are you okay no somethings wrong somethings wrong
matt pushes past her running upstairs
casey starts to follow but then stops lowering the camera
casey you have to come in here
mom matt is come in here right now
come in here right now
caseys filming the big screen tv which is showing the news
going to have a feed live on the scene in the second we apologize for the delay but as of right now every news helicopter in the greater multnomah county
is headed to portland again right now we have very little information but the word is that the bombings started just over nine minutes ago and havent subsided yet with okay heres the feed from nbc chopper
we get a helicopter view from over downtown portland everything seems okay and then something streaks by crashing headlong into the side of a building
the impact is like a wrecking ball office furniture blowing out into the air along with glass steel and concrete wham
wait that was that was not a bomb i repeat not bombings its something else the camera turns as matt rushes down the stairs now in his winter parka his
nose plugged with kleenex
we hear another of those jarring shattering impacts and the camera goes back to the tv revealing the big made in oregon sign in old town toppling down into the
i need your car

you dont have your license you cant drive without your license
theyre getting into downtown now
we can hear sirens
casey is filming out the window everything looks normal until theres a loud crash then casey swishes the camera to reveal that a police car its siren still moaning has
landed on top of a newstand apparently dropped from the sky
how how is that possible thats not possible theres an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rains down onto the car
matt slams on the brakes looking up through the windshield searching the sky
where are you man
theres a beat and then a police officer abruptly appears on the passengers side next to casey
listen you cant be here i need you to turn this car around right now and the police officer is yanked upwards disappearing from sight for a moment before coming
crashing down thirty feet away
matt please please the car suddenly rockets into the air straight up flipping end over end past the tops of the buildings and then comes to a stop hanging at
about two hundred feet
caseys breathing is painfully short and sharp
matt stares out into the night sky
he flicks on the brights
theres andrew in his hospital gown floating a dozen feet out his flesh charred and twisted his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain
a news helicopter circles past out of sight and for a moment andrew is framed in the choppers spotlight
his eyes flash to the car
screaming the windshield is torn out and seconds later matt is ripped out of the car as though yanked by a giant hook taking his seatbelt with him
no no no
the car goes into freefall no longer important to andrew plummeting down down down
caseys screams are barely audible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush past outside her camera frozen in place as she plummets to her death
and then suddenly so suddenly its completely disorienting the side of the car bursts apart and were flying blurred views of buildings the sky the side of some jeans
caseys camera is pointed down showing her adidas
and matts high tops
stay here okay
you have to stay here
barely coherent you can fly
i have to talk to andrew
casey im sorry im so sorry
matts feet suddenly go out of frame
note in the following sequence everything is seen in glimpses and glances never lingering too long on one thing
much of what happens should be seen through implication rather than direct effect
everything happens very fast and none of the cameras can fully keep track
the feed is crisp and clear but without the satellite audio meaning no narration from the reporter
there are several choppers flying at different distances from the action and we intercut as necessary
the news chopper at first shows caseys destroyed car laying in the street then pans back up to show andrew whos floating hunched over vomiting
matt flies up behind him and tries to help him but andrew shoves him away
were too far away to hear anything thats said
matt tries again and andrew yells something
matt clearly upset replies
andrew talking fast and jerky gestures towards his burns
matt tries to reply several times but andrew isnt hearing it
matt smiles nervously at the destruction and says something gently
andrew replies and whatever is said here it causes a radical shift in matts demeanor
hes no longer concerned he seems repulsed
andrew says more clearly screaming at matt
matt seems to beg andrew for something and andrew relents
matt continues more forcefully and then notices something to his right
a bus smashes him out of the air swatting him andrew suddenly turns flailing an arm at us in the chopper a mailbox comes crashing up into the camera
michael ernesto is along with several other people from his building out on his roof
he watches in horror as the helicopter andrew hit goes out of control falling out of frame
moments later we hear the explosion as it crashes
oh oh no those people man those people oh god wheres the other guy
hes fucking dead man you saw oh shit oh shit andrew comes toppling down out of the sky like a wounded bird crashing into the roof
he vomits again mostly bile everyone around him is in shock frozen as he screams in pain and rolls over
hes bleeding badly from the nose and ears
agonized crying no ones gonna help me
no ones gonna help me now
we get some shots from other peoples cameras video phones etc on the roof
some people scream and try to run past andrew and he blasts them off the roof like bowling pins which leads to more screaming
andrew stands shakily looking directly at michael ernesto
please man please i dont know you man mumbled what type of camera is that
breaking down what
i dont know i dont know you man i didnt please okay please andrew starts to raise an arm when hes suddenly nailed by matt blasting by at well over
eighty miles an hour
the inside of the bank is quiet and peaceful when matt and the police car rockets up the street but has to screech to a halt when matt and andrew
come exploding out of the front of the two of them brawl in the street for a moment its not impressive martial arts or even super powered just two guys fighting for their lives
matt gets the upperhand decking andrew and driving him to the ground and suddenly the cop car our pov lifts off
we go flying into matt crashing out the camera as he turns and creates a telekinetic wall
cala filming from her apartment window watches in shock and horror as the police car carried by its momentum is sent flipping into the air and we glimpse it as
it passes her window lights still flaring
her sister rushes up looking out the window
sissy stay away from the window
whats happening whats happening theyre right out there fighting
theyre andrew and matt come blasting up through the floor in the the two boys come smashing up through the roof of the apartment building
andrew flies low and matt gives chase
andrew turns beginning to telekinetically lob everything at street level at matt traffic lights parking meters trees etc
but matts too good a flyer
what he doesnt block he simply dips and weaves around
andrew clearly still woozy is distracted and smashes into a street light wiping out on the asphalt
one of them just went down
matt slowly lands nearby
the camera zooms in and hits them both with a spotlight causing matt to shield his eyes and look up scared as andrew struggles to stand
we get a good look at the toll this is taking on him matts face is a crimson mask of blood from his nose eyes mouth and ears
hes limping badly his clothes torn visibly covered with injuries
he looks like hes been in a car wreck
oh shit look at him
he approaches andrew talking again more fervently
andrew just shakes his head falling repeatedly as he tries to stand like a wounded dog
two cop cars skid to a halt nearby the officers unloading and taking cover
one of them advances on matt and andrew gun raised
matt goes out in front of andrew protective pleading raising his hands
the cop is clearly panicked
he fires a shot
matts arm whips out impossible fast he buckles and screams in pain holding his hand which is gushing blood
andrew blasts the matt falls screaming and andrew stands
oh jesus christ
andrew approaches matt screaming and looking absolutely terrifying
matt turns and rockets off into the sky andrew following a second later tackling matt out of the air
were at street level in downtown people are absolutely everywhere wandering out into the street baffled scared and looking for answers
a field reporter fixes herself preparing to speak
okay yeah gimme two one were live on the scene on parson boulevard just south of the center of downtown and theres a rushing screeching sound from around the corner
the camera jerks and moves towards the corner the cameraman man running to see what the sound is
shawn wait youre unplugged
shawn something around the corner explodes and matt comes flying past overhead slightly on fire before andrew comes lunging at matt catching him twisting out and over the camera man
andrew lifts matt up high into the air scraping him against buildings on either side of the street bouncing like a pinball until
matt struggles and theres a visible ripple in the air a massive concussive burst sending both of them rocketing downwards as though shot out of a cannon
they strike the massive bronze statue of portlandia a trident wielding demigoddess in front of the michael graves building uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to the ground
matts body accordions brutally when he lands and he flops down at a broken dead angle
andrew lands nearly as badly lays still for a moment and then begins twitching and screaming when the choppers spotlight hits him
the statue of portlandia lays awkwardly in the street
matt is motionless blood pooling around him his back broken
a bunch of squad cars and emergency units converge around the front of the michael graves building and downed statue
matt and andrews bodies are painted by spotlights as police and news helicopters hang overhead
police unload en mass guns out immediately forming a perimeter and pushing in
were with them as they approach the mood is of barely controlled panic officers shouting back and forth to each other
andrew and matt are polka dotted by red laser sight dots
andrew suddenly stands up and several officers fire the bullets spark off an invisible barrier in front of him and he shakily raises both hands
the all of the police officers firemen and paramedics are telekinetically lifted into the air
they hang struggling for a moment and then all of their limbs go rigid
weve seen this before
andrew screams and then
it all happens in under two seconds
matt swings an arm blinding fast the triton wielding arm of portlandia bends jaggedly bringing down the pitchfork hard first through andrew then into the pavement
andrew stands impaled a look of shock on his face and then matt flails up his hand the bullet lodged inside fires out striking andrew in the head killing him
all of the floating people drop dazed
after a moment the police advance
the clean room cams are incredibly hi def crisp and clear with all manner of data and time codes scrolling all over the top and bottom of the screens
matt lays on the floor of a perfectly white room
at the far end is a blackened out two way mirror
theres a camera on the inside of this too and we can see resolute men in suits reflected on the inner glass watching with unreadable expressions
there is a chair and a table but hes clearly fallen out of the chair
its maybe an hour after the scene in front of the michael graves building and hes received no medical attention
to this end matt is suffering from among other things massive blood loss multiple broken bones dozens of gashes and cuts presumed internal bleeding and a broken back
he can barely move sliding around on the floor in his own blood as he dies watched by the compassionless eyes of the cameras
he is barely coherent screeching in agony
help me help me please
im so sorry i tried help me help me im dying im dying
stars i see stars somebody it hurts please
im the blood
two men in contamination suits enter the room wielding some kind of radiation sensors
they go over to matt scanning him
listen help me help me
im dying you have to help me dont just let me please im sorry
im the men ignore him as matt makes some gasping sounds his eyes going wide
i can hear the singing
matt entirely stops moving
he lays there not breathing completely still
and then suddenly the two men are flung backwards as is the table and the chair
there are a series of grotesque popping and snapping sounds from matts body and he jerks and writhes pushing himself up onto his hands and knees
the security cams track and zoom and as matt stands we realize a startling truth his cuts are closing themselves
his broken bones have already molded back into place
his bruises are shrinking away to nothing
the blacked out glass suddenly shatters and falls out of its frame revealing a shocked frightened room of high ranking military personnel along with several men in civilian clothes
matt stares at them
they stare back at him
son you dont i mean
matt raises a finger to his lips and the general trails off
matt smile weakly for a moment then stops
would you please
turn off the fucking cameras
we see a variety of international reporters covering a breaking story but only see little clips of each in multiple languages
behind them are various shots of a huge hydroelectric dam in south korea
expected to burst at any moment city officials blame the malfunctions on the terrorist bombing that occurred at the dams control center last march
botched evacuation has left thousands of the kyo lee valleys residents trapped with only one major roadway leading in or out
a roadway that has not been repaired in over ten years again the scale here is just unprecedented
our hearts are with people of kyo lee tonight
kim hai su is behind the camera filming his father s as his father hurries to gather his things into a duffle
kim hai sus younger brother wanders into the room crying loudly and kims father screams at him to put down the camera
theyre in the car driving fast through town
all around we can see people panicking and we see two cars collide on the road up ahead
they pull up onto an on ramp and are immediately trapped into gridlocked dead end traffic
kim hai sus father begins shrieking and banging on the dashboard which triggers his younger brother crying again
kim shouts to calm down
kim is climbing out of the car people all around are getting out of their cars hopelessly trapped
someone screams and kim turns to reveal an enormous dam several miles away
rubble is falling off the side of an gigantic crack which splits further
kim yells in fear
the crack widens an enormous tidal gush of water bursts through gushing down the side of the hills into the valley
kims father embraces him and they have a brief exchange when suddenly theres the sound of a sonic boom overhead
all around them people explode into cheers
its not fear but rather a kind of frantic ovation
the camera sweeps up panning the empty blue sky excitedly finally coming to rest on matt garrety
looking fucking great as he floats above the freeway
he pantomimes yeah bring it on cheer louder
this gets the intended response and he pumps a fist shouting fuck yeah he turns pretending to notice the oncoming flood for the first time mouths oh shit
points at the flood casually as it closes in i should deal with this
another huge ovation and matt smiles widely nods his head yeahhhhhh
theres a sonic boom as he goes from zero to mach in less than a second rattling the cars on the freeway disappearing into the distance over the flood
after a moment the impossibly huge onrush of water seems to stop slowing and freezing in place and then
slowly begins the camera jerks around wildly as the crowd goes insane embracing kissing screaming jumping on their cars
kims father has collapsed into tears of joy next to the car and kim himself is hooting and hollering from the bottom of his lungs
the camera comes up to show his little brother who is going positively ape shit on the hood of their car jumping up and down screaming smiling
