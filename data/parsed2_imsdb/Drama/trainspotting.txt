trainspotting screenplay by john hodge based on the novel by irvine welsh directed by danny boyle legs run along the pavement
they are mark rentons
just ahead of him is spud
they are both belting along
as they travel various objects pens tapes cds toiletries ties sunglasses etc
either fall or are discarded from inside their jackets
they are pursued by two hard looking store detectives in identical uniforms
the men are fast but renton and spud maintain their lead
voice over choose life
choose a job
choose a career
choose a family choose a fucking big television choose washing machines cars compact disc players and electrical tin openers
suddenly as renton crosses a road a car skids to a halt inches from him
in a moment of detachment he stops and looks at the shocked driver then at spud who has continued running then at the two men who are now closing in
in a bare dingy room renton lies on the floor alone motionless and drugged
o choose good health low cholesterol and dental insurance
choose fixed interest mortgage repayments
choose a starter home
choose your friends
on a flood lit five a side pitch renton and his friends are taking on another team at football
the opposition all wear an identical strip arsenal whereas renton and his friends wear an odd assortment of gear
three girls lizzy gail and allison and baby stand by the side watching
the boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much dirtier
as each performs a characteristic bit of play the play freezes and their name is visible printed or written on some item of clothing
t shirt baseball cap shorts trainers
in begbies case his name appears as a tatoo on his arm
sick boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it
begbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it
spud in goal lets the ball in between his legs
tommy kicks the ball as hard as he can
rentons litany continues over the action v
o choose leisure wear and matching luggage
choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics
choose diy and wondering who you are on a sunday morning
choose sitting on that couch watching mind numbing sprit crushing game shows stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth
choose rotting away at the end of it all pishing you last in a miserable home nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish fucked up brats you have spawned
to replace yourself
choose your future
renton is hit straight in the face by the ball
he lies back on the astroturf
voice over continues
but who would i want to do a thing like that
renton lies on the floor
swanney allison and baby sick boy and spud are shooting up or preparing to shoot up
sick boy is talking to allison as he taps up a vein on her arm
o i chose not to choose life i chose something else
and the reasons
there are no reasons
who need reasons when youve got heroin
goldfingers better than dr
both of them are a lot better than diamonds are forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office in which field of course thunderball was
a notable success
o people think its all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite which is not to be ignored but what they forget spud is shooting up is
the pleasure of it
otherwise we wouldnt do it
after all were not fucking stupid
at least were not that fucking stupid
take the best orgasm you ever had multiply it by a thousand and youre still nowhere near it
when youre on junk you have only one worry scoring
when youre off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite
got no money cant get pished
got money drinking too much
cant get a bird no chance of a ride
got a bird too much hassle
you have to worry about bills about food about some football team that never fucking winds about human relationships and all the things that really dont matter when youve got
a sincere and truthful junk habit
i would say in those days he was a muscular actor in every sense with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster but combined with a sly wit
to make him a formidable romantic lead closer in that respect to cary grant
o the only drawback or at least the principal drawback is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that begbie smoking and drinking speaks to camera
no way would i poison my body with that shite all they fucking chemicals no fucking way
tommy sits beside lizzy
he speaks to camera
its a waste of your life rents poisoning your body with that shite
rentons father and mother sit at the table eating
renton is seated but not eating
every chance youve ever had youve blown it stuffing your veins with that filth
gav wears the corporate jacket
get off that stuff rents and get a job
its not as bad as it looks
while youre here you dont fancy buying a cooker do you
sick boy and spud lie drugged up
allison and baby wait while swanney cooks up
renton is standing up
o from time to time even i have uttered the magic words
are you serious
im finished with that shite
well its up to you
im going to get it right this time
going to get it set up and get off it for good
ive heard it before
the sick boy method
they both look at sick boy yeah well it surely worked for him
hes always been lacking in moral fibre
he knows a lot about sean connery
thats hardly a substitute
youll need one more hit
no i dont think so
to see you through the night that lies ahead
freeze frame on swanney
o we called him the mother superior on account of the length of his habit
he knew all about it
on it off it he knew it all
of course id have another shot after all i had work to do
the door opens and renton enters carrying shopping bags
he empties them on to a mattress beside three buckets and a television
o relinquishing junk
stage one preparation
for this you will need one room which you will not leave one mattress tomato soup ten tins of mushroom soup eight tins of for consumption cold ice cream vanilla
one large tub of magnesia milk of one bottle paracetamol mouth wash vitamins mineral water lucozade pornography one bucket for urine one for feces and one for vomitus one television and one bottle of valium which i have already procured from my mother who is in her own domestic and socially acceptable way also a drug addict
renton swallows several valium tablets
voice over continues
and now im ready
all i need is a final hit to soothe the pain while the valium takes effect
swanney sick boy spud and allison and baby all lie inert while the telephone rings
renton curses as he slams down the receiver
he dials again
its mark renton
can you help me out
renton holds two opium suppositories in the palm of his hand
o this was typical of mikey forrester
on screen what the fuck are these
o under the normal run of things i would have had nothing to do with the cunt but this was not the normal run of things
ideal for your purpose
slow release like
bring you down gradually
custom fucking designed for your needs
i want a fucking hit
thats all ive got take it or leave it
renton sticks his hand down the back of his trousers and sticks the suppositories into his rectum
feel better now
for all the good theyve done me i might as well have stuck them up my arse
o heroin makes you constipated
the heroin from my last hit is fading away and the suppositories have yet to melt
i am no longer constipated
he looks around the local amenities
he is in discomfort clutching his abdomen and falling to his knees
he notices a betting shop
renton walks through the crowded smoky betting shop towards a door marked toilet with a bit of card
o i fantasize about massive pristine convenience
he stumbles through
o brilliant gold taps virginal white marble a seat carved from ebony a cistern full of chanel no
and a flunky handing me pieces of raw silk toilet roll
but under the circumstances ill settle for anywhere
this is the most horrible toilet in britain
alone renton makes his way through the horrors to a cubicle
renton locks the door
he looks into the bowl and winces with disgust even in his state
he pulls the chain
the chain comes off
he drops his trousers sits on the bowl and closes his eyes
a lorry on a building site dumps a load of bricks b s shed their load on vietnam the blue peter elephant etc
renton has his eyes closed
they snap open
he looks down between his legs
he drops to his knees in front of the bowl and rolls his sleeve up
with no more hesitation he plunges his arm into the bowl and trawls for the suppositories
it seems to take ages
he cannot find them
he sticks his arm further and further into the toilet moving his whole body close
he strains to find it
his head is over the bowl now
gradually he reaches still further until his head is lowered into the bowl followed by his neck torso other arm and finally his legs all disappearing
the cubicle is empty
renton dressed as before swims through murky depths until he reaches the bottom where he picks up the suppositories which glow like luminous pearls before heading up towards the surface
the toilet is empty
suddenly renton appears through the bowl then his arms as he lifts himself out
still clasping his two suppositories he walks out of the toilet
the mattress buckets and supplies are laid out as before
the door opens and renton enters still soaking and dripping
the suppositories are in his hand
he holds them up and they twinkle in the light
now im ready
the cans of soup the bottle of water and the carton of ice cream are empty the bottle of pills spilt the magazines well thumbed
you only live twice
nineteen sixty seven
one hundred and sixteen minutes
eh ian fleming
he never wrote any of them
ok so who was it then
you can look it up
sick boy throws across a worn copy of a film guide
renton cannot be bothered to pick it up
how are you feeling since you came off the skag
for myself im bored
who wrote it
but youre looking better it has to be said
you dont know do you
and i wondered if youd care to go to the park tomorrow
usual set up
who wrote it
typical weather neither good nor bad
the park is nondescript arid green with a few bushes
this is not kew gardens
renton and sick boy appear dressed as before but for the addition of cheap sunglasses
renton is carrying a battered old cassette player and a carry out in a plastic bag
sick boy is carrying a small tatty suitcase from oxfam
they scan the horizon and give each other the nod
they walk towards the bushes
o the down side of coming off junk was that i knew i would need to mix with my friends again in a state of full consciousness
it was awful they reminded me so much of myself i could hardly bear to look at them
take sick boy for instance he came off junk at the same time as me not because he wanted too you understand but just to annoy me just to show
me how easily he could do it thereby downgrading my own struggle
sneaky fucker dont you think
and when all i wanted to do was lie along and feel sorry for myself he insisted on telling me once again about his unifying theory of life
seen through the telescopic sight of an air rifle that wanders over various potential targets children pensioners couples gardeners etc
its certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life
what do you mean
well at one time youve got it and then you lose it and its gone for ever
all walks of life george best for example had it and lost it or david bowie or lou reed some of his solo stuffs not bad
no its not bad but its not great either is it
and in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right its actually just shite
so who else
charlie nicholas david niven malcolm mclaren elvis presley
ok ok so whats the point youre trying to make
sick boy rests the gun down
all im trying to do is help you understand that the name of the rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory
what about the untouchables
i dont rate that at all
despite the academy award
that means fuck all
the sympathy vote
so we all get old and then we cant hack it any more
is that it
thats your theory
yeah beautifully fucking illustrated
give me the gun
day through the sight again
this time a skinhead and his muscle bound dog are in view
sick boy and renton talk like sean connery
do you see the beast
have you got it in you sights
clear enough moneypenny
this should present no significant problem
the gun fires and the dog yelps jumps up and bites its owner the skinhead
for a vegetarian rents youre a fucking evil shot
renton loads up again
o without heroin i attempted to lead a useful and fulfilling life as a good citizen
two milkshakes clink together
renton and spud and seated at a booth dressed in their own fashion for job interviews
good luck spud
now remember yeah
if they think youre not trying youre in trouble
first hint of that theyll be on to the dss this cunts no trying and your giro is fucking finished right
but try too hard and you might get the fucking job
its a tightrope spud a fucking tightrope
my problem is that i tend to clam up
i go dumb and i cant answer any questions at all
nerves on the big occasion like a footballer
renton unfolds silver foil to reveal some amphetamine
spud dips in a finger and takes a dab
he nods in appreciation as he tastes it
renton leaves the packet in spuds hand
a little dab of speed is just the ticket
a woman and two men and are interviewing renton
his job application form is on the desk in front of them
renton i see that you attended the royal edinburgh college
indeed yes those halcyon days
one of edinburghs finest schools
oh yes indeed
i look back on my time there with great fondness and affection
the debating society the first eleven the soft know of willow on leather im an old boy myself you know
do you recall the school motto
of course the motto the motto strive hope believe and conquer
those very words have been my guiding light in what is after all a dark and often hostile world
renton looks pious under scrutiny
you seem eminently suited to this post but i wonder if you could explain the gaps in your employment record
yes i can
the truth well the truth is that ive had a long standing problem with heroin addiction
ive been know to sniff it smoke it swallow it stick it up my arse and inject it into my veins
ive been trying to combat this addiction but unless you count social security scams and shoplifting i havent had a regular job in years
i feel its important to mention this
there is silence
a paper clip crashes to the floor
the same office
the same team are interviewing spud
no actually i went to craignewton but i was worried that you wouldnt have heard of it so i put the royal edinburgh college instead because theyre both schools right
and were all in this together and i wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details yeah
people get all hung up on details but whats the point
like which school
does it matter
or how many o grades did i get
could be six could be one but thats not important
whats important is that i am right
that i am
murphy do you mean that you lied on your application
only to get my foot in the door
showing initiative right
you were referred here by the department of employment
theres no need for you to get you foot in the door as you put it
whatever you say man
youre the man the governor the dude in the chair like
im merely here
but obviously i am
here that is
i hope im not talking too much
i dont usually
i think its all important though isnt it
murphy what attracts you to the leisure industry
in a word pleasure
my pleasure in other peoples leisure
what do you see as your main strengths
i love people
even people that no one else loves i think theyre ok you know
no not homeless people
beggars francis begbie one of my mates
i wouldnt say my best mate i mean sometimes the boy goes over the score like one time when we me and him were having a laugh and all of
a sudden hes fucking gubbed me in the face right mr
murphy leaving your friend aside do you see yourself as having any weaknesses
i have to admit it im a perfectionist
for me its the best or nothing at all
if things go badly i cant be bothered but i have a good feeling about this interview
seems to me like its gone pretty well
weve touched on a lot of subjects a lot of things to think about for all of us
thank you mr
well let you know
the pleasure was mine
best interview ive ever been to
spud crosses the room to shake everyone by the hand and kiss them
o spud had done well
i was proud of him
he fucked up good and proper
renton and spud meet up after the interviews
a little too well if anything a little too well thats my only fear compadre
would not say no would not say no
the woman and two men sit in silence
it is saturday night in a busy city centre pub on two levels
on a large upper balcony overlooking the bar and floor downstairs sit spud gail renton sick boy tommy lizzy and begbie
begbies story overlaps with the subsequent depiction of the incident
o picture the scene
wednesday morning in the volley
me and tommy are playing pool
no problems and im playing like paul fucking newman by the way
im giving the boy here the tanning of a lifetime
so anyway it comes to the final ball the deciding shot of the tournament im on the black and hes sitting in the corner looking all biscuit arsed
then this hard cunt comes in
obviously fancied himself
starts looking at me
right fucking at me
trying to put off like just for kicks
looking at me as if to say come ahead square go
well you know me im no looking for trouble but at the end of the day im the cunt with the pool cue and im game for a swedge
so i squared up casual like
so what does the hard cunt do or so called hard cunt
puts down his drink turns around and gets the fuck out of there
and after that the game was mine
the events in the pool hall as described by begbie
begbie and tommy are playing pool
begbie is playing like a wizard
tommy looks defeated
lining up for the final ball begbie is distracted by a large hard man standing at the bar staring at him
begbie stands up and walks slowly towards the hard man
they stand eye to eye for a moment
begbie swings the pool cue slowly into his palm
the hard man turns and leaves
begbie drinks the hard mans pint then pots the black with a brilliant shot
begbie his story complete finishes his pint
the others continue to stare at him frozen as though expecting something more
begbie smiles and throws the pint over his head
freeze frame the glass in mid air and begbies smiling face
o and that was it
that was begbies story
or at least that was begbies version of the story
but a couple of days later i got the truth from tommy
it was one of his major weaknesses he never told lies never took drugs and never cheated on anyone
rentons hand flicks through a long row of videos on the floor while the sound of weights being lifted by tommy emanates from nearby
most of the videos are feature films or comedy shows some with titles written in tommys hand but two catch rentons attention
they are great goals and tommy and lizzy vol
the latter a handwritten title
renton looks from the video round to tommy who is engrossed in lifting weights
well sure it was wednesday morning we were in the volley playing pool that much is true
tommys account over a depiction of his version
o but begbie is playing absolutely fucking gash
hes got a hangover so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue never mind pot the ball
im doing my best to lose trying to humour him like but its not doing any good every time i touch the ball i pot something every time begbie goes
near the table he fucks it up
so hes got the hump right but finally i manage to set it up so all hes go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage
a little pride and maybe not kick my head in right
so hes on the black pressure shot and it all goes wrong big time
what does he do
picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him of putting him off by looking at him
can you believe it
i mean the poor cunt hasnt even glanced in our direction
hes sitting there quiet as a mouse when beggars gubs him with the cue
he was going to chib him i tell you then i thought he was going to do me
the beggar is fucking psycho but hes a mate you know so what can you do
the events are as follows begbie and tommy are playing pool
begbie furious miscues goes in off etc
tommy deliberately misses sitters and tries to look annoyed
begbie lines up to play the black
it is unmissable
at the bar beyond sits a harmless young man wearing the same clothes as the hard man in begbies account except that they are now baggy rather than taut
he is clearly not staring at begbie but drinks a half pint and eats some crisps
as begbie plays the man bites a crisp
begbie miscues rips the cloth and the ball flies off the table
tommy catches it and looks up to see begbie assaulting the young man
tommy cautiously restrains begbie and he reaches into his jacket for a knife
begbie turns and for a moment looks as though he might attack tommy
tommy puts down his weights
renton holds up great goals
can i borrow this one
the freeze frame of the glass in mid air and begbies smiling face
o yeah the guys a psycho but its true hes a mate as well so what can you do
just stand back and watch and try not to get involved
begbie didnt do drugs either he just did people
that what he got off on his own sensory addiction
the glass falls into the crowd
a woman is bleeding from a wound in her head
the men beside her turn furiously around to look for the source of the glass
up on the balcony begbie stands up
the screams and shouting continue below
begbie appears at the bottom of the staircase down from the balcony
he strides towards the bleeding woman and begins shouting
the girl got glassed and no cunt leaves here until we find out which cunt did it
a man stands up from one of the tables
and who the fuck do you think you are
begbie kick the man in the groin
another moves towards him but is blocked by the men surrounding the girl
soon the whole mass dissolves into a brutal scrum in which begbie plays a prominent part
up on the balcony the rest of the gang watch in silence
the empty cover for great goals lies on the floor
sick boy and renton sit dispassionately watching tommy and lizzy in their home made soft porn video
o and as i sat watching the intimate and highly personal video stolen only hours earlier from one of my best friends i realized that something important was missing from
a mass of dancing bodies fills the floor
the music is very loud
at the side of the dance floor sit tommy and spud
the look rather gloomy
there is an empty seat beside each of them
spud is drinking heavily
tommy turns and speaks to spud
his lips move but nothing is audible
spud is not ever aware that tommy has spoken
tommy bellows in spuds ear
tommys words and all subsequent conversation in the dance area of the club appear as subtitles the characters communications somewhere between speech and mime
hows it going with gail
no joy yet
how long is it
its a nightmare
she told me she didnt want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in
where did she come up with that
she read it in cosmopolitan
six weeks and no sex
ive got balls like watermelons im telling you
gail and lizzy are smoking and talking
i read it in cosmopolitan
its an interesting theory
actually its a nightmare
ive been desperate for a shag but watching him suffer was just too much fun
you should try it with tommy
what and deny myself the only pleasure i get from him
did i tell you about my birthday
tommy and spud seated as before
their words are subtitled
as they are speaking gail and lizzy return and sit down
useless motherfucker thats what she called me
i told her im sorry but theses things happen
lets put it behind us
thats fair enough
yes but then she finds out ive bought a ticket for iggy pop the same night
absolutely fucking radge
its me or iggy pop time to decide
so whats it going to be
well ive paid for the ticket
what are you two talking about
what were you talking about
gail and lizzy shopping standing nearby but apart from them is renton
renton notes spud and tommy with their partners and across the other side sick boy and begbie are engaged in flirtatious conversation with two women
o the situation was becoming serious
young renton noticed the haste with which the successful in the sexual sphere as in all others egregated themselves from the failures
begbie and sick boy with the two women
renton standing among a group of lone nerds
renton wades on to the dance floor looking at countless women all whom either turn away or are spoken for
o heroin had robbed renton of his sex drive but now it returned with a vengeance
and as the impotence of those days faded into memory grim desperation took hold in his sex crazed mind
his post junk libido fuelled by alcohol and amphetamine taunted him remorselessly with his own unsatisfied desire dot
renton notices one girl diane walking on her own towards the door
a man carrying two drinks catches up with her and walks backwards talking to her
she says nothing
he blocks her way
she takes one drink and downs it then the other handing him back the empty glasses
she steps past him and walks on towards the door
o and with that mark renton had fallen in love
the girl walks away from the club scanning the street for a taxi and hail one which stops just as renton calls out
excuse me i dont mean to harass you but i was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation
i thought to myself shes special
whats your name
where are you going diane
im going home
its where i live
ill come back if you like but im not promising anything
diane halts abruptly as a taxi pulls up
do you find that this approach usually works or let me guess youve never tried it before
in fact you dont normally approach girls am i right
the truth is that youre a quite sensitive type but if im prepared to take a chance i might just get to know the inner you witty adventurous passionate loving
loyal a little bit crazy a little bit bad but hey dont us girls just love that
eh well whats wrong boy
cat got your tongue
i think i left something back at the the girl has disappeared into the back of the taxi
renton looks around
are you getting in or not pal
the taxi motors along
renton and diane are kissing passionately in the back
spud is pushed against the wall held by his lapels
he drinks from a bottle of beer in one hand
do you understand
spud nods drunkenly
gail releases her grip
our relationship is not being redefined it is developing in an appropriate organic fashion
i expect you to be a considerate and thoughtful lover generous but firm
failure on your part to live up to these very reasonable expectations will result in swift resumption of a non sex situation
spud drinks from a bottle in the other hand and says nothing but he does not look too happy
tommy and lizzy kiss while tommy unlocks the door
in a darkened suburban hallway the door opens and two figures enter
they walk through another door and close it behind them
tommy and lizzy kiss against the inside of th door taking their outer clothes off
by a pale bedside light diane and renton undress
spud is lying unconscious on the bed
gail stands over him
wake up spud wake up
she kicks him
she kicks him again
he moans again
you useless bastards
so lets see what im missing
she begins undressing him
renton lies on his back while diane rides above him
gail throws spuds clothes to the floor and throws a blanket over him
she switches out the light
tommy and lizzy now lie on the bed in a state of semi undress
tommy lets put the tape on
yes i want to watch ourselves while were screwing
tommy gets up and reaches into the row of videos on the floor
he lifts out tommy and lizzy vol
and hastily shoves it into the video
tommy sits back on the bed with the remote control and presses play as lizzy kisses him
his face registers consternation
on the television archie gemmill scores his famous goal against holland in
renton and diane climax together
diane immediately climbs off and wraps herself in a robe
christ i havent felt that good since archie gemmill scored against holland in
you cant sleep here
you can sleep on the sofa in the living room or go home
its up to you
and dont make any noise
the lights are full on now
lizzy sits on the bed clutching a blanket around herself
tommy hops around in his underwear searching desperately
all the videos are opened and scattered everywhere
what do you mean its gone
where has it gone tommy
itll be here somewhere
i might have returned it by mistake
to the video shop tommy
to the fucking video store
so every punter in edinburgh is jerking off to our video
god tommy i feel sick
renton lies submerged under a blanket
the sounds of a normal morning travel from a room nearby whistles radio voices
renton peeps over the edge of the blanket then covers his head again
spud opens his eyes
with his fingers he feels crusted liquid around his mouth
abruptly he turns around the bed is soaked in vomit
he looks under the cover and drops it again in revulsion
renton pulls himself up off the sofa and dresses as quickly as possible
spud wipes the vomit from his chest with a pillowcase which he dumps in the middle of the sheets before gathering the whole lot up as a bundle
the door swings open
a man and a woman about rentons age sit at the kitchen table
they look up to see renton in the doorway
come in and sit down
you must be mark
renton walks to the table and sits down
yes thats me
youre a friend of dianes
more of a friend of a friend really
are you her flatmates
the couple exchange a look and laugh
i must remember that one
the man and woman look beyond renton
he too turns and follows their gaze
diane stands in the doorway
she is wearing school uniform
the door swings open to reveal the kitchen
gail her father and mother are seated around the table eating breakfast
they look towards spud who carries the knotted bundle of sheets as he approaches the table
good morning spud
sit down and have some breakfast
sorry about last night its all right
i slept fine on the sofa
i had a little too much to drink
im afraid i had a slight accident
oh dont worry these things happen
it does everyone good to cut loose once in a while
this one could do with being tied up once in a while
ill put the sheets in the washing machine just now
no ill wash them
ill take them home and bring them back
theres no need
its no problem
no problem for me either
honestly its no problem
id really rather take care of it myself
spud theyre my sheets
she takes hold of the bundle
spud does not yield
she pulls harder
spud holds on
she tugs powerfully
the bundle bursts open with an explosion of vomit and excrement that covers everything in the kitchen
only spud remains untouched
i guess this means ill never get to have sex with gail
tommy sits alone watching great goals renton paces briskly down the street followed by diane
i dont see why not
because its illegal
no not holding hands
in that case you can do it
you were quite happy to do a lot more last night
and thats whats illegal
do you know what they do to people like me inside
theyd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet
they stop at the school gates
youre not going to jail
easy for you to say
can i see you again
renton walks away
if you dont see me again ill tell the police
renton turns and walks back to her
they stand for a moment then renton walks away again
to herself ill see you around then
in the cold light of morning tommy and lizzy wait not speaking outside the still closed video store
a train speeds across
sick boy tommy spud and renton sit drinking from an extensive carry out
this had better be good
it will be
itll make a change for three miserable junkies who dont know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack
if im giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket im just saying it had better be good
theres plenty of other things i could be doing
such as sitting in a darkened room watching videos drinking smoking dope and wanking
does that answer your question
they sit in silence
the station is in the middle of a moor
there appears to be no habitation around
in the distance are some hills
the train stands at the station
as it pulls away renton spud tommy and sick boy are left standing on the platform looking around
we go for a walk
tommy points vaguely across the moor
are you serious
they step across the tracks toward the vast moorland
all but tommy sit down on rocks or clumps of heather
well what are you waiting for
i dont know tommy
i dont know if its
a group of three serious walkers trudge past from the other end of the platform decked out in regulation berghaus from head to foot
they tramp off towards the wilderness
the boys watch them go
spud opens a can
its the great outdoors
its really nice tommy
can we go home now
its fresh air
look tommy we know youre getting a hard time off lizzy but theres no need to take it out on us
doesnt it make you proud to be scottish
i hate being scottish
were the lowest of the fucking low the scum of the earth the most wretched servile miserable pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilization
some people hate the english but i dont
theyre just wankers
we on the other hand are colonized by wankers
we cant even pick a decent culture to be colonized by
we are ruled by effete arseholes
its a shite state of affairs and all the fresh air in the world will not make any fucking difference
the three serious walkers are receding into the distance
the boys troop back towards the platform
o at or around this time we made a healthy informed democratic decision to get back on drugs as soon as possible
it took about twelve hours
renton hands over money to swanney
renton then begins cooking up
also present and cooking or shooting up are spud swanney allison and baby and sick boy
o it looks easy this but its not
it looks like a doss like a soft option but living like this its a full time business
renton spud and sick boy are stuffing objects into their shirts and pockets
renton lies back narcotized
renton and spud are running along the street
two uniformed store detectives are running after them
sick boy stands in a doorway
as the detectives run past he strolls away in the opposite direction
renton lies back as before
ursula andress was the quintessential bond girl
thats what everyone says
the embodiment of his superiority to us beautiful exotic highly sexual and yet unavailable to everyone but him
lets face it if shed shag one punter from edinburgh shed shag the fucking lot of us
spud cooks up watched by swanney
nearby lie the drugged forms of renton sick boy and allison and baby
rentons mother and father sit reading the paper and a magazine
renton trawls through drawers and any containers shoe boxes make up boxes under the mattress etc
until he finds some cash jewelry
renton lies back staring vacantly ahead
tommy flops down beside him
renton shows barely a flicker of awareness
lizzys gone mark shes gone and fucking dumped me
it was the video tape and that iggy pop business and all sorts of other stuff
she told me where to go and no mistake
i said is there any chance of getting back together like but no way no fucking way
a few elderly patients sit in armchairs watching daytime television
renton and spud jump and climb through an open window
watched by the helpless patients they calmly disconnect the television and take it with them as they leave by the same route
renton and tommy slumped side by side as before
i want to try it mark
youre always going on about how its the ultimate hit and that
better than sex
come on im a fucking adult
i want to find out for myself
renton huddles up and leans away from tommy
ive got the money
tommy produces ten pounds from his pocket
renton and spud run along the street
tommy lies drugged on the floor
the door of an ordinary flat is kicked open
begbie walks in crowbar in hand followed by sick boy and spud
honor blackman a
pussy galore what a total fucking misnomer
i wouldnt touch her with yours
id sooner shag col kreb
at least you know where you are with a woman like that
not much to look at like but personality thats what counts thats what keeps a relationship going through the years
i mean heroins got fucking great personality
sick boy opens the heel of a his shoe to reveal a syringe
swanney hands over a small bag of heroin in exchange for ten pounds from renton
spud checks the fridge and pulls out a large chunk of deep frozen meat
he hits with the crowbar until it fractures and splits
inside there is some jewellery
the car is empty
a window is broken and the door opened
the car alarm goes off
renton reaches under the seat and finds the radio cassette
he then pulls the bonnet release
the car alarm rings on until renton calmly produces a pair of wire cutters and a spanner to cut free and release the battery
the alarm is silenced
renton walks away with the battery and the stereo
o swanney taught us to adore and respect the national health service for it was the source of much of our gear
we stole drugs we stole prescriptions or bought them sold them swapped them forged them photocopied them or traded them with cancer victims alcoholics old age pensioners aids patients epileptics
and bored housewives
we took morphine diamorphine cyclozine codeine temazepam nitrezepam phenobarbitone sodium amytal dextropropoxyphene methadone nalbuphine pethidine pentazocine buprenorphine dextromoramide chlormethiazole
the streets are awash with drugs that you can have for unhappiness and pain and we took them all
fuck it we would have injected vitamin c if only theyd made it illegal
the gp examines rentons chest and smiles
the gp turns to wash his hands
renton pulls on his shirt and steals a prescription pad off the desk
renton lies back with his eyes close
a football enters the frame to bounce off his head and out again
he opens his eyes and it happens again
opposite him spud sick boy and tommy stand looking down on him
tommy throws the ball again
its the first day of the edinburgh festival
renton tommy spud sick boy and begbie sit drinking
they observe a young male american tourist walk in in a bulky red anorak and glasses
he goes past them towards the toilet
begbie stands up
the american tourist turns from the urinal to see begbie renton sick boy spud and tommy approaching
begbie punches and kicks the tourist and pulls out a knife
the door of the taxi opens begbie tommy spud sick boy and renton get in carrying the red anorak and glasses
as the taxi pulls away they study the photograph in the passport
they look at one another in agreement
the taxi motors along
a man at the bar is now wearing the red anorak
begbie divides up the money among sick boy tommy spud and renton
renton takes his share
and remember rents no skag
aye ok fr
o but the good times couldnt last for ever
renton lies as before
around the room are swanney allison tommy spud and sick boy
allison begins screaming and wailing
slowly the others rouse themselves to varying degrees
o i think allison had been screaming all day but it hadnt really registered before
she might have been screaming for a week for all i knew
its been days since ive heard anyone speak though surely someone must have said something in all that time surely to fuck someone must have
whats wrong allison
allison points toward the bundle of dirty blankets in which her baby is wrapped
sick boy follows her directions
calm down calm down
its going to be all right everythings going to be just fine
o nothing could have been further from the truth
in point of fact nothing at all was going to be just fine
on the contrary everything was going to be bad
i mean worse than it already was
sick boy stands over the bundle
the baby is dead
sick boy reaches out to allison
o it wasnt my baby
she wasnt my baby
she wasnt mine
i dont know
maybe allison knew
i wished i could think of something to say something sympathetic something human
say something mark say something im cooking up
there is a silence
renton begins scrambling around through the works
cook one for me renton
i need a hit
o and so she did i could understand that
to take the pain away
so i cooked up and she got a hit but only after me
that went without saying
renton spud and sick boy cross the road to approach the shop
o well at least we knew who the father was now
it wasnt just the baby that died that day
something inside sick boy was lost and never returned
it seemed he had no theory with which to explain a moment like this
renton spud and sick boy are stuffing their pockets as seen before
rentons theft is interrupted by dianes voice
hello there mark
diane is standing just beside him
what are you doing
renton is speechless but a few stolen items fall from inside his jacket down to the floor
diane looks down
spud and sick boy start to snigger
one of the store detectives become aware of the group
he starts walking towards them
you didnt tell me you were a thief
hey go easy lady
the boys got a habit to support
opium doesnt just grow on trees you know
a few more items fall from rentons jacket as the store detective closes in
renton looks at diane
renton and spud are running pursued by the two store detectives
o nor did i
our only response was to keep on going and fuck everything
pile misery upon misery heap it up on a spoon and dissolve it with a drop of bile then squirt it into a stinking purulent vein and do it all
keep on going getting up going out robbing stealing fucking people over propelling ourselves with longing towards the day it would all go wrong
as seen in the opening scene renton is nearly hit by a car that screeches to a halt as he crosses a road
he looks at the driver at spud running away and the store detectives approaching
o because no matter how much you stash or how much you steal you never have enough
no matter how often you go out and rob and fuck people over you always need to get up and do it all again
renton smiles and waits
o sooner or later this sort of thing was bound to happen
one of the detectives runs straight past him after spud
the other detective crashes into renton with a mighty punch in the stomach
spud and renton stand in the dock
rentons mother and father sick boy begbie and spuds mother mrs
murphy are among those in the gallery
the sheriff delivers his sentence
because shoplifting is theft which is a crime and despite what you may believe there is no such entity as victimless crime
heroin addiction may explain your actions but it does not excuse them
mr murphy you are a habitual thief devoid of regret or remorse
in sentencing you to six months imprisonment my only worry is that it will not be long before we meet again
mr renton i understand that you have entered into a programme of rehabilation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin
the suspension of your sentence is conditional upon your continued cooperation with this programme
should you stand guilty before me again i shall not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence
thank you your honour
with gods help ill conquer this affliction
the sheriff and renton stare at one another for a moment
renton turns to look at spud then back towards the sheriff who is now leaving the court
o what can you say
well begbie had a phrase for it
the pub is crowded
around renton are his mother father begbie sick boy and gav
it was fucking obvious that that cunt was going to fuck some cunt
there is a round to nodding and poor spuding
everyone begins to talk at once
i hope youve learned your lesson son
oh my son i thought i was going to lose you there
youre nothing but trouble to me but i still love you
clean up your act sunshine
cut that shite out for ever
you listen to francis mark hes talking sense
fucking right i am
see inside you wouldnt last two fucking days
theres better things that the needle rents
i remember when you were a baby even when you would never do what you were told
but he pulled it off clever bastard and he got a result
they laugh then fall silent
renton turns around
behind him stands spuds mother
mrs murphy im sorry about spud
its wasnt fair him going down and not me tears in her eyes mrs murphy turns and walks away
renton watches her go
behind him begbie shouts
its no our fault
your boy went down because he was fucking smack head and if thats not your fault i dont know what is
begbie turns back to renton
ill get the drinks in
he moves towards the bar
renton slips away
renton walks through the bar towards the toilets then out of a back door
renton emerges into a narrow yard surrounded by a high wall
he looks around
the steel back gate is locked
o i wished i had gone down instead of spud
here i was surrounded by my family and my so called mates and ive never felt so alone never in all my puff
since i was on remand theyve had me on this programme the state sponsored addiction three sickly sweet doses of methadone a day instead of smack
but its never enough and at the moment its nowhere near enough
i took all three this morning and now ive got eighteen hours to go till my next shot and a sweat on my back like a layer of frost
i need to visit the mother superior for one hit one fucking hit to get us over this long hard day
renton climbs the wall
he stands on top then dives off the other side executing a somersault in mid air
swanney is cooking up
renton lands on the floor behind him like a gymnast
whats on the menu this evening
your favourite dish
your usual table sir
why thank you
renton sits on his usual cushion on the floor
and would sir care to settle his bill in advance
stick it on my tab
regret to inform sir that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago
in that case he produces twenty pounds
oh hard currency why sir thatll do nicely
he swipes the notes underneath a uv forgery checker
cant be too careful when were dealing with your type can we
renton begins his search for a vein
would sir care for a starter
some garlic bread perhaps
no thank you
ill proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs please
as you wish
he hands renton the syringe
renton inject then lies back on the dirty red carpeted floor
he lies completely still
his pupils shrink
his breathing becomes slow shallow and intermittent
he sinks into the floor until he is lying in a coffin shaped and coffin sized pit lined by the red carpet
swanney stands over him
perhaps sir would like me to call for a taxi
an ambulance siren becomes faintly audible
the siren is a little louder
swanney holds renton under his arms and drags him backwards down the steps
as swanney emerges still dragging renton the siren grows louder and then an ambulance speeds by without stopping
swanney drags renton across the pavement and into the open door of a waiting taxi
swanney then steps out of the taxis other door pausing only to tuck a ten pound note into rentons pocket before closing the door
renton lies on the floor of the taxi as swanney left him rolling slightly as the taxi takes a corner
the taxi is stationary
we do not see the drivers face but his hand opens the door and then drags renton out on to the pavement by his ankles before taking the ten pound
note getting back in the cab and driving away
renton lies on the pavement
two porters life him by arms and ankles on to a trolley
we do not see the porterss faces as they wheel renton into the hospital
renton is wheeled through the department then into a bay surrounded by a white nylon curtain
the porters lift renton from one trolley on to another then leave him alone in the bay surrounded by the curtain
renton lies alone
his breathing is still shallow and erratic
around him is the usual accident and emergency paraphernalia blood pressure machine oxygen tap bandages etc
a doctor comes in and gives renton an injection then leaves
renton breathes more easily
the two porters return with another trolley
they lift renton roughly on to it and wheel him away
the porters wheel renton along
the porters lift renton off the trolley and dump him on the bed
a nurse sticks a thermometer in his mouth
rentons father and mother lift renton now fully conscious off the bed and dump him in a wheelchair
mother walks ahead
behind her father pushes renton in the wheelchair
mother and father sit on either side of renton
father shoves renton on to the bed then walks out past mother who looks at renton for a moment before closing the door
rentons fathers hand slides three bolts across to lock the door
renton lies on the bed
o i dont feel the sickness yet but its in the post thats for sure
im in the junky limbo at the moment too ill to sleep too tired to stay awake but the sickness is on its way
sweat chills nausea pain and craving
need like nothing else i have ever known will soon take hold of me
its on the way
the door opens
rentons mother walks in with a bowl of soup and a piece of bread
father watches from the doorway
well help you son
youll stay with us until you get better
well beat this together
maybe i could go back to the clinic
no clinics no methadone
that made you worse you said so yourself
you lied to us son your own mother and father
at least get us some tempazepam
no youre worse coming off that than you are with heroin
nothing at all
its a clean break this time
youre staying where we can keep an eye on you
i do appreciate what youre trying to do i really do but i need just one score to ease myself off it
mother retreats past father who closes the door
the bolts go home again
renton lies back and closes his eyes
his forehead is damp with sweat
he begins to shake
he tosses and turns becoming wrapped up in a swathe of blankets
as he unravels them he is astonished to find a fully clothed begbie in the bed with him
well this is a good laugh you fucking useless bastard
go on sweat that shite out of your system because if i come back and its still there ill fucking kick it out
begbie laughs and covers himself up
renton rips away the blankets but begbie has gone
renton looks up
baby dawn is crawling across the ceiling
renton looks down to see diane sitting on the end of the bed
diane sings temptation by new order
oh youve got green eyes oh youve got red eyes and ive never met anyone quite like you before
renton looks back up
dawn continues her slow crawl leaving behind a thick rail of unidentifiable slime
renton looks down
sick boy sits on the end of the bed holding a cup of tea and a chocolate biscuit
mother stands behind him
its a mugs game mrs renton
im not saying i was blameless myself far from it but there comes a time when you have to turn your back on that nonsense and just say no
sick boy takes a bit of his biscuit
dawn crawls on
she has fangs now
spud sits on the end of the bed in a caricature prison uniform with arrows on it plus a ball and chain
dawn has claws as well
tommy sits on the end of the bed
he looks terrible
better than sex rents better than sex
the ultimate hit
im a fucking adult
ill find out for myself
well ive found out all right
renton looks up again just as the baby drops on to his face
he tears her off and throws her into a corner
rentons mother and father are washing him
mother bends down and picks up the large damp sponge from the corner where it landed
she wipes her sons face with it
mark theres something you need to do
a doctor stands up as renton enters
sit down please
they both sit down
well youve already spoken to one of our counsellors but before we go on therere just a few questions id like to ask you
renton his mother and father sit watching television
renton is sitting inside a plastic booth shaped like a giant syringe
the doctor now dressed as a game show host stands in front with rentons mother and father beside him
question number one the human immunodeficiency virus is a what
retrovirus is the correct answer
question number two hiv binds to which receptor on the host lymphocyte
mother and father confer
cd receptor is the correct answer
and now question number three is he guilty or not guilty
hes our son
is the correct answer
and now its time to take the test
a garish hostess walks on with two envelopes
she holds them out for mother to choose one
the doctor watches in silence as the hostess now dressed as a medical technician draws blood from rentons arm and puts it into a tube
she marks the tube with a pre printed numbered label
mother opens one of the envelopes
she is speechless with joy
the plastic booth opens up
lights flash again etc
renton steps out
renton his mother and father sit at a table in the local social club
it is a saturday night and the club is busy
everyone sits in rapt silence
it is not initially clear what is going on
near the bar a caller with a microphone calls over the pa two and four twenty four
clickety click sixty six and so on as he draws the numbers from the drum
everyone studies their cards except renton who studies the people instead his drink untouched
the number calling continues until suddenly interrupted by mothers voice
mark youve got a house
for goodnesss sake mark
they bustle around him and pass his card to the front
o it seems however that i really am the luckiest guy in the world
several years of addiction right in the middle of an epidemic surrounded by the living dead but not me im negative
and once the pain goes away thats when the real battle starts
you feel so fucking low youll want to fucking top yourself
his mother counts a wad of money in front of him
on the door of a flat plaguer hiv and junky aids scum are daubed on the walls
the sound of a ball being regularly bounced against a wall can be heard
it is poorly furnished
tommy is seated
renton has the football which he kicks against the wall and catches then drops and kicks again and so on
the ball is slightly flat
are you getting out much
following the game at all
renton drops the ball
it rolls to a halt in the corner
he sits down
you take the test
im sorry tommy
have you got any gear on you
no im clean
well sub us then mate
im expecting a rent cheque
renton produces some of his bingo win
as he hands the notes over their eyes and hands meet for a moment
tommy puts the money away
continued thanks mark
o no problem easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood
renton walks along a corridor and into a ward
sheets cover the lower half of swanney in bed
they are thrown back to reveal the stump of an above knee amputation
renton sits down and takes it in silence
hit the artery by mistake
common enough error or so the quack tells us as though thats going to make my leg grown back
still it could have been worse it could have been my fucking dick
and i tell you what in this place you get looked after clean sheets regular meals and all the morphine you can eat
and see when i get out of here
ive got plans
going to get myself straightened out and head off to thailand where women really know how to treat a guy
see out there you can live like a king if youve got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket
no fucking problem
the strategy is this get clean get mobile get into dealing and this time next year ill be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on
sounds great swanney
youll have to send us a postcard
sure will pal sure will
renton and sick boy are seated in their firing patch sitting on plastic bags with beer vodka hash and the cassette player
the airgun is present as before but they are not making any use of it
it wasnt that bad
did he you know
no he didnt make me touch it
oh no dont even mention it
he made me lick it
god youre sick
and i got a stitch stuck between my teeth jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off
cut it out
when are you going to visit him
youre a real mate
and what about tommy
have you been to see him yet
sick boy is silent
he stiffens as he avoids rentons gaze
they shift fractionally apart
ok so tommys got the virus
bad news big deal
the gig goes on or hadnt you noticed
swanney fucks his leg up
well tough shit but it could have been worse
youre all hear
i know a couple of addicts
stupid wee lassies
i feed them what they need
a little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull
its easy money for me
not exactly a fortune but im thinking i should be coining it here
less whores more skag
get clean get into dealing thats where the future lies
set up some contacts get a good load of skag punt it profit
what do you think
and ill tell you why
because im fed up to my back teeth with losers no hopers draftpacks schemies junkies and the like
im getting on with life
what are you doing
renton sits alone on the bed making a joint and reading a book
there is a knock at the door
renton answers the door
what do you want
are you clean
is that a promise then
yes as a matter of fact it is
calm down im just asking
is that hash i can smell
i wouldnt mind a bit if it is
well it isnt
smells like it
youre too young
too young for what
renton looks in each direction along the empty passageway
renton and diane are lying in the bed
diane wearing one of rentons t shirts is rolling a mega joint quite unaware of the scrutiny of renton
youre not getting any younger mark
the world is changing music is changing even drugs are changing
you cant stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and ziggy pop
its iggy pop
i mean the guys dead anyway
iggy pop is not dead
he toured last year
tommy went to see him
the point is youve got to find something new
diane completes the joint
o she was right
i had to find something new
there was only one thing for it
as contemporary retake of all those swinging london montages red routemaster trafalgar square big ben royalty city gents in suits chelsea ladies fashion victims piccadilly circus at night
incut with close ups of classic street names on a street map all the ones made famous by monopoly
the montage ends on one street then draws back to reveal the whole map of london pinned to a wall
a man holding a telephone walks in front of the mape and belches loudly
revealing more he is in a scruffy cramped office with half a dozen occupied desks and twice as many telephones
seated at the one nearest to the belching man is renton
he is wearing a shirt and tie now
he turns in response to the belch
can you take this call
renton takes the telephone and reaches for a piece of paper from which he reads
hello yes certainly
its a beautifully converted victorian town house
ideally located in a quiet road near to local shops and transport
renton checks his watch
renton stands waiting beside this busy london road outside some very unfortunate housing as the traffic streams past
o two bedrooms and a kitchen diner
fully fitted in excellent decorative order
lots of storage space
all mod cons
three hundred and twenty pounds per week
a couple approach
renton unlocks the door of a flat and holds the door open while he ushers them in
renton shows the couple round a typical london flat nightmare
a poor conversion poor decor everything small and ill fitting
the windows rattle as the traffic roars by
o i settled in not too badly and i kept myself to myself
sometimes of course i thought about the guys but mainly i didnt miss them at all
after all this was boom town where any fool could make cash from chaos and plenty did
i quite enjoyed the sound of it all
profit loss margins takeovers lending letting subletting subdividing cheating scamming fragmenting breaking away
there was no such thing as society and even if there was i most certainly had nothing to do with it
for the first time in my adult life i was almost content
renton finishes eating a pot noodle
he puts it down and picks up a letter
he lies back and reads
intercut with a class is in progress
a teacher lectures to a mixed class but diane is not listening as she is writing
diane is leaving the school when sick boy catches up with her
they stop and then she walks away
diane walks along a concrete path
as she does so she has to step over spud who lies asleep unconscious beside the remains of a carry out
o dear mark im glad youve found a job and somewhere to live
school is fine at the moment
im not pregnant but thanks for asking
your friend sick boy asked me last week if i would like to work for him but i told him where to go
i met spud who sends his regards or at least i think thats what he said
no one has seen tommy for ages
and finally fracis begbie has been on television a lot this week
renton turns the page
o as he is wanted by the police in connection with an armed robbery in a jewellers in corstorphine
yours with love diane
there is a buzz at the door
renton re examines the letter
there is another buzz
renton opens the door to an unseen figure
it is begbie
renton sits on the bed
begbie stands over him pointing a gun at his head
he pulls the trigger
it clicks harmlessly
with a replica
how can it be armed robbery
its a fucking scandal
he fires the gun a few more times at his own head then chucks it to the floor
and the haul
he digs a few rings out of his pocket and throws them to renton
solid silver my arse
i took it to a fence its trash pure trash
theres young couples investing all their hopes in that stuff and what are they getting
its a scandal franco
too right it is
now look have you got anything to eat cos im fucking lee marvin by the way
begbie is sitting on the bed in his underwear eating cereal while watching television
a small carry out is nearby
renton finishes dressing for work
he pauses at the open door looking back towards his guest
o begbie settled in in no time at all
begbie opens a can of beer
renton closes the door
renton closes his door
he is about to walk away when he heard begbie shouting
from the bedsit rents rents come fucking back here
renton opens the door
begbie is holding out an empty packet of cigarettes
ive no fucking cigarettes
begbie throws the packet down to the floor
it lands near the door
he has turned back to the television and takes a swig of beer
renton closes the door again
renton and begbie lie in the single bed with their heads at opposite ends
renton is wide awake with a pair of smelly socked feet only inches from his nose
o yeah the guys a psycho but its true hes a mate as well so what can you do
where the first empty packet of cigarettes fell to the floor there is now a large heap of empty packets the product of weeks at sixty a day
another one lands on the pile
begbie still in his underwear still can in hand sits watchig the racing as before
behind his cigarettes and alcohol are stacked up like a miniature duty free warehouse
renton sits behind him reading a book
hey im wanting a bet put on
can you not go yourself
im a fugitive from the law
i cant be seen on the fucking streets
now watch my lips
five pounds to win
the door opens renton walks out the door closes and renton walks away
a wild frightening scream erupts from beyond the door
begbie alone in the bedsit is screaming a cry of primal joy
o bad bot came in at to
and with the winnings we went out to celebrate
to loud music and strobing fractured lights surrounded by dry ice begbie dances near a tall woman
other people dance nearby
begbie gives the thumbs up to renton who sits on a stool at one side drinking from a bottle of beer
begbie and the woman walk away
renton looks around the club at the various men and women
o diane was right
the world is changing music is changin drugs are changing even men and women are changing
one thousand years from now therell be no guys and no girls just wankers
sounds great to me
its just a pity that no one told begbie
a car sits in a street near the club windows steamed up
begbie and the woman embrace passionately
the woman undoes begbies trousers
rentons gaze continues to wander around
o you see if you ask me were heterosexual by default not be decision
its just a question of who you fancy
begbie and the woman continue their embrace as she unbuttons his shirt
o its all about aesthetics and its fuck all to do with morality
suddenly bedbie freezes
he is holding the womans groin
there is something there that shouldnt be
begbie goes crazy simultaneously trying to put his clothes back on hit the woman and get out of the car
begbie stumbles away from the car pulling up his trousers as he goes
o but you try telling begbie that
begbie sits on the bed
renton is sitting on the floor watching
im no a fucking buftie and thats the end of it
lets face it it could have been wonderful
begbie leaps off the bed grabs renton and head butts him then holds him by the lapel
now listen to me you little piece of junky shit
a jokes a fucking joke but you mention that again and ill cut you up
begbie produces his knife
there is a knock on the door
they do not move
there is another knock
begbie lies sleeping on the bed
there are now two sets of feet by his head one on each side
at the other end lie renton awake and sick boy asleep
o since i last saw him sick boy had reinvented himself as a pimp and a pusher and was here to mix business and pleasure setting up contacts as he
constantly informed me for the great skag deal that was one day going to make him rich
renton sits at his desk haggard and tired
other people bustle around him
telephones ring etc
in the background the man who belched is trying to promote a flat down the telephone
beautifully converted victorian town house
ideally located in a quiet road near to local shops and transport
two bedrooms and a kitchen diner
fully fitted in excellent decorative order
lots of storage space
all mod cons
three hundred and twenty pounds a week
renton still dressed for work begbie and sick boy sit in a line on the bed with fish suppers laid out on their laps but rentons is untouched
i cant believe you did that
i got a good price for it
rents i need the money
it was my fucking television
well christ if id known you were going to get so humpty about it i wouldnt have bothered
are you going to eat that
he takes rentons fish supper and adds it to his own
have you got a passport
well this guy ive met runs a hotel
loads of contacts
does a nice little sideline in punting british passports to foreigners
get you a good price
why would i want to sell my passport
it was just an idea
renton drops his passport into an envelope and throws the envelope into a locker
he turns the key and pockets it
o i had to get rid of them
sick boy didnt do his drug deal and he didnt get rich
instead he and begbie just hung around my bedsit looking for things to steal
i decided to put them in the worst place in the world
traffic floods past as before
inside the flat that renton showed the couple around
sick boy and begbie are standing in the hallway
renton is in the open doorway
he throws them the keys and leaves
the cramped bedsit is a mess filled with litter and unwashed clothes
renton lies on his bed content to be alone
the flat is in darkness
the door opens a figure enters
it is the man from rentons office
o but of course they werent paying any rent so when my boss found two desperate suckers who would sick boy and begbie were bound to feel threatened
man is followed by another couple
he switches on a light
as you can see its a beautiful conversion
two bedrooms kitchen diner
lots of storage
all mod cons
three hundred and twenty quid a week
from nowhere begbie and sick boy spring out at him
renton looks around the stripped empty bedsit one last time before closing the door as he leaves
o and that was that
but by then we had another reason to go back
an intercity train speeds by
a kitten sits on the floor
o tommy knew he had the virus like but never knew hed gon full blown
o what was it pneumonia or cancer
o no toxoplasmosis
sort of like a stroke
a service is in progress
those present include renton and gav who are engaged in hushed conversation begbie spud sick boy and lizzy
he wanted to see lizzy again
he indicated lizzy
lizzy wouldnt let him near the house
so he brought a present for her brought her a kitten
i bet lizzy told him where to put it
im not wanting a cat she says
get to fuck right
so theres tommy stuck with this kitten
you can imagine what happened
the thing was neglected pissing and shitting all over the place
tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers
he didnt know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit
i didnt either
what the fuck is it
the kitten as before
slow track back to reveal more
o he starts getting headaches so he just uses more smack for the pain like
there he has a stroke
a fucking stroke
just like that
god home from hospital and died about three weeks later
been dead for ages before the neighbours complained about the smell and the police broke the door down
tommy was lying face down in a pool of vomit
the lower half of tommys clothed body is visible
the coffin travels away
gav and renton watch it go
the kitten was fine
gav renton spud sick boy begbie and a few others are gathered in the pub still dressed in their funeral garb
every time i think of tommy i think of australian because every time i went round he was just lying there junked out of his mind watching aussie soaps
until he sold the telly of course then he was just lying there
buy every time i think of him i still think of australia
there is a short silence before spud begins softly singing two little boys
he finishes unaccompanied
spud begbie and renton are seated
sick boy is handing around bottles of beer before he too sits down
they are all wearing their funeral garb
renton raises his bottle
they all drink

heroin is in the process of being prepared for injection heated drawn up etc
an arm is prepared for injection sleeve rolled up tourniquet bound veins tapped etc
mikey forrester sick boy spud and begbie look on
o i hadnt told anyone everything that was running through my mind about what might happen in london
there were a lot of possibilities i didnt want to talk to anyone about
ideas best kept to myself
what no one told me was that when we bought the skag some lucky punter would have to try it out
begbie didnt trust spud and sick boy was too careful these days so i rolled up my sleeve and did what had to be done
renton injects the heroin into a vein in his arm
its good its fucking good
renton walks past a beggar huddling against a wall
the beggars sign reads falklands veteran
i lost my leg for my country
the beggar is swanney
o yes that hit was good
i promised myself another one before i got to london just for old times sake just to piss begbie off
the bus travels towards london
sick boy dabs at amphetamine
renton cooks up in the bus toilet
o this was to be my final hit
but lets be clear about this theres final hits and final hits
what kind was this to be
some final hits are actually terminal one way or another while others are merely transit points as you travel from station to station on the junky journey through junky life
begbie sits grimly
the others are relaxed
o this was his nightmare
the dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck ups in town
i knew what was going on in his mind any trouble in london and he would dump us immediately one way or another
he had to
if he got caught with a bagful of skag on top of that armed robbery shit he was going down for fifteen to twenty
begbie was hard but not so hard that he didnt shite it off twenty years in saughton
did you bring the cards
the last thing i said to you was mind the cards
well ive not brought them
its fucking boring after a while without the cards
well ive not brought them
its fucking boring after a while without the cards
bit fucking late like
well why didnt you bring them
because i fucking told you to do that you doss cunt
the bus travels through london
the gang enter a cheap hotel
begbies bag contains the heroin
they are met by andreas a man in his late thirties of mediterranean appearance
he shakes sick boys hand
these are your friends
these are the guys i told you about
is he here
yes hes here
i hope you didnt get followed or nothing
we didnt get followed
andreas leads them along a corridor and into a room
an exceptional man is waiting
andreas leaves the room and closes the door
the man opens both and tastes the heroin
he produces a set of kitchen scales from his bag and weighs the two bags
o straight away he clocked us from what we were small time wasters with an accidental big deal
so what do you want for it
but its not worth more than fifteen
the man shakes his head and lights a cigarette
nineteen i cant offer you im sorry
o this was a real drag to him
he didnt need to negotiate
i mean what the fuck were we going to do if he didnt buy it
sell it on the streets
the deal is done
the man hands over the money and waits as it is counted then leaves with the drugs
o we settled on sixteen thousand pounds
he had a lot more in the suitcase but it was better than nothing
and just for a moment it felt really great like we were all in it together like friends like it meant something
a moment like that it can touch you deep inside but it doesnt last long not like sixteen thousand pounds
the pub is crowded with afternoon drinkers
renton spud sick boy and begbie sit drinking
begbie is still keeping a firm hand on the sports bag which now holds the money
so what are you planning with your share spud

one plam tree a couple of rocks and a sewage outflow
i dont know maybe ill buy something for my ma and then buy some good speed no bicarb like then get a girl take her out like and treat her

begbie stands up

sick boy walks away towards the toilet

i guess you would franco
begbie walks away to the bar
spud and renton look at each other and the bag of money
are you game for it
spud looks at the bag and around the pub towards the toilet door and begbie
begbie stands at the bar awaiting the pints
are you serious
renton looks around
i dont know
what do you think
spud says nothing
suddenly they are interrupted
still here i see
sick boy sits down
i know i would
renton turns to see begbie making his way through the crowd with the pints helf precariously
as he reaches the table a man standing with a group of friends accidentally nudges begbie causing a pint to spill over him
for fucks sake
sorry mate ill get you another
all down my fucking front you fucking idiot
look im sorry i didnt mean it
sorrys no going to dry me off you cunt
cool down franco
the guys sorry
not sorry enough for being a fat cunt
if you cant hold a pint you shouldnt be in the pub mate
now fuck off
begie drops the remaining three pints
as the man looks down to the falling glasses begbie punches him in the face and knees him in the groin
a fight breaks out between the man and begbie
sick boy rushes forward to restrain begbie
renton sits still not even looking at the fight or what follows
his eyes are fixed on the bag while his hands fiddle
begbie stabs spud in the hand
good one franco
shut you mouth or youll be next
youve stabbed me man
you were in my way
begbie blade still in hand addresses the entire pub
and anyone in my way gets it fucking gets it
everybody hear that
nobody says anything
renton is seated as before avoiding begbies gaze
begbie addresses him
hey rent boy bring us down a smoke
renton does not move
wed better go franco
ive got to get to the hospital man
to spud youre not going to and fucking hospital
to sick boy youre staying there
to renton and you bring me a fucking cigarette
renton swivels and stands up
and the bag
renton lifts the bag and slowly approaches begbie
renton nervous hand shaking pulls a packet of cigarettes from a pocket and holds it towards begbie
begbie does not move
renton holds out the bag
begbie takes it
now renton selects a cigarette and hands it over to begbie
begbie inhales deeply and then blows the smoke towards renton renton lies awake sharing a bed with sick boy who is asleep
spud and begbie lie on the other both asleep
begbie has an arm draped over the bag holding it close
renton gets up and goes to the small bathroom
he puts the light on above the mirror and looks at himself
he washes his face and drinks a glass of water then walks back to the bedroom
renton pulls on his jacket and shoes
he stands over begbie then reaches carefully down to life begbies arm up
as he does so he realizes that spud is watching him
they say nothing
renton takes the bag
begbie stirs but does not wake
renton looks down at spud for a moment before unzipping the bag
he pulls out a small wad of cash which he hands to spud
spud tucks the wad away
renton walks to the door and opens it
he nods to spud then disappears
envelope being removed
renton takes the passport from the envelope
renton walks away
o now ive justified this to myself in all sorts of ways it wasnt a big deal just a minor betrayal or wed outgrown each other you know that sort
of thing but lets face it i ripped them off
my so called mayes
but begbie i couldnt give a shit about him and sick boy well hed have done the same to me if only hed thought of it first and spud well
ok i felt sorry for spud he never hurt anybody
