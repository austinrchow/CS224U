written by john gatins dec
its still more night than day as we look down on the hotel atlanta
the lit sign for the hotel atlanta may be the only source of light as we hear a metallic rattle
we follow the metallic rattle to a door
the rattling stops and we watch the knob slowly turn
tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces hope
we pull back to find that both arms are employed in the pulling of what looks like a large suitcase
nicole maggen a beautiful but tired woman finishes pulling the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded up massage table out of the motel room
with her bra in one hand and the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior nd floor hallway of the motel she assesses her situation
she digs in her purse lights a cigarette and continues digging in her purse
she finds a beat up candy tin
she opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt foils heroin foils looking for residue
she now finds and holds up the bucks she just made
she flips open her cheap phone and makes a call
she thinks better of it and hangs up
nicole forces the clumsy table into the hatchback of a toyota tercel and slams it shut
we hear the electronic ring of her cheap cell phone on speaker phone mode
the phone rests on the passenger seat
we pull up to find nicole slumped with her head resting on the steering wheel
she is exhausted and irritated
as the phone rings dont pick up
dont pick up
dont pick up
a man answers with music in the background
nicole quickly picks up the phone
its nic do you have any
good morning to you too
well where are you guys shooting today
text me the address
you have some
she hangs up the phone and catching herself in the rearview she tries to smile
the sun would be rising if the sky wasnt swirling with grey clouds
we see the american suites hotel and recognize it as a decent commuters hotel near the airport in orlando
the sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture
through the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive time radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter
an attractive young woman wrestles free of the covers and gets out of bed
she crosses naked through the room as a cell phone starts ringing
back to the bed as whip whitaker rises into frame and inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo
whip wears his some years of life experience like a medal
smoke hangs in the air and empty beers a pint of vodka and two empty carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as whip snatches up his phone and
for the love of christ
he aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the hotel ice bucket
the naked young woman bends over to pick up her clothes
we witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect crack down the middle
whip smiles taking it all in
into the phone ive been up since the crack a dawn
how much does it cost to go there
the young woman has re lit the last half of a joint and is puffing it to life as whip is beckoning with his large hands
the young woman looking more like a stripper by the second hands the joint to whip who takes a masterful drag
whip shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on the phone
he exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone
you decided he needed private school
lemme talk to knuckles
tellem the phone works both ways
oh hes my son because you need a tuition check
thats great deana
im glad you tracked me down in orlando at in the fucking morning to shake me down for money
does he even like the fucking school
no ive never seen it
yeah i wonder why not too
i gotta oclock flight sit tight till i get back to atlanta
how am i a liar
no ill call you
whip hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window
was that your wife
that was my ex wife
but you trina you could be my second or third wife if youd just cmere
the young woman we now know as trina smiles seductively
whip dont even joke about that
our flights at lets hit it
trina is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a white blouse as she hands whip his pants
whip cant help but pat that perfect ass as trina tries to skip away
on the radio we hear the opening bars of a familiar rock anthem
joe cockers im feeling alright
yeah im feelin a little light headed
i shoulda ate somethin
whip leans over the motel table picks up a soda straw thats been cut in half
he efficiently sniffs up a line of coke
whip wears his pilot blues and carries his hat as he strides confidently down the hallway
joe cocker continues to wail perfectly narrating the heros swagger that whip maintains while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper
whip leans against the landing gear of the jackson ridgefield passenger jet he takes a swig from a small bottle of mouthwash gargles then spits the green foam on the
whip wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the mouthwash in his pocket then quickly completes his visual walk around
he looks at the sky again as he steps on to the jet way ladder
his foot slips sending his shoe splashing in to a puddle
son of a bitch
whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the stairs
whip enters the jetway from the exterior door at the entrance of the plane
trina is greeting a man and his son
morning miss marquez
morning captain whitaker
whip waits as trina politely parts the stream of folks to allow whip to enter the plane
whip exchanges a look with a mature flight attendant margaret thomason
she cant help but smile
captain whitaker that sky gonna hold
youre not gonna make me spend another night in orlando
dont worry margaret im gonna get you home for your prayer meeting at
what is it
jesus christ superstar th baptist king church
trina and camelia satou the other flight attendant laugh
thats right christ the king first baptist church on hazel and th street
and im still saving you a seat next to me
come on down
one of these nights margaret im comin
you hold my seat
the girls laugh at the familiar exchange
whip enters the cockpit removes his hat and nods to ken evans our clean cut young first officer
walk around is complete
whip pulls his emergency oxygen mask off the bulkhead and takes a huge hit
emergency oxygen checks
offering the mask to you want a hit
no thank you sir
tries to break the chill my pleasure to share the chair with ya
didnt we fly together
evans lets him hang
no sir not that i remember
ken evans sir

whip studies this little bible thumper for a second before
calls to the galley margaret
sweetie will you get me a coffee black lots of sugar
and some aspirin
you want something
looks to margaret no maam
then lets push
i got a great on time record
yes sir you gottit
and how you feeling today sir
whip focuses on evans trying to read into that statement
but this is a quick turn for me
ten turns in three days
margaret returns with the coffee placing it down near whips chair on an airline cocktail napkin
heres your coffee and the final manifest
souls on board
thank you thank you thank you youre a life saver
and margaret gettem tucked in were ready to push
whip goes to the head
margaret and evans exchange a look
nicole gets out of her tercel and slams the door twice before it closes
she checks the address on her phone and looks up at the enormous mansion
nicole pushes through the overly tall front door of the house
at first glance its completely empty unfurnished
a guy in cargo pants and a baseball hat sleeps sitting up against the huge dual staircase that leads to the second floor
random boxes of video equipment are now evident as are thick cables that lead to a staircase going down
on the staircase she immediately encounters another young crew guy holding a tiny lap dog while standing next to a naked girl wearing a shakespearean military helmet
the young crew guy holds up the be quiet finger to his lips
nicole quietly makes her way down a few steps stopping at the odd duo
we now hear activity downstairs music
suddenly the young crew guy frantically points at the naked othello you bastard
and she grabs the tiny dog and hustles downstairs
nicole waits with the young crew guy until we hear
nicole is free to walk all the way downstairs now
nicole enters to reveal a large porn set with a shakespearean theme specifically othello
we see an elizabethan four poster bed with a canopy surrounded by stone arches and cardboard venetian columns
in the bed we find an african american porn actor laying with two female adult actors
a girl with dyed blonde hair stands naked next to the throne smoking a joint as she shaves her crotch with a mans electric razor
nicole approaches a young tattooed man who only wears board shorts
hes talking with an older asian man as they groom a pile of coke for snorting
he sniffs a quick line and gets up to kiss her she turns her cheek avoiding the coke frozen kiss
nicole this is tiki pot
hes my partner in this new series he knows a lot about porn
kip i need grams of h
tiki and i are trying to put the narrative back in porn

a tall thin kid joins them
he wears a moorish headdress and has a bath towel wrapped around his waist

nicole walks away
kip follows her
at the door

she begins to cry sweetheart dont cry

kip hands her a tiny baggy of coke
he kisses her cheek
out the window
the rain pounds
whip leans close to the windshield in an attempt to improve his view
evans reaches down and throws a switch
the windshield wipers go on
we can now see very clearly the path of lights the plane is to follow
whip looks to evans smiles with stoned eyes
evans looks out at the rain
looks pretty ugly sir
a little rain never hurt anybody
were not made of sugar
whats the rvr
half a mile
right at minimums
winds gusting to
is our crosswind max
i know what our crosswind max is
tellem were good to go at the end
evans just stares at whip
southjet say intentions
whip looks right at evans
evans keys the radio
southjet will be ready to go at the end
whip stares forward not looking at evans
nervous passengers stare out the windows as the jr lumbers along the tarmac headed for the runway
we follow trina whose ass looks as good in a tight navy skirt as it does split bare with orange fluorescence
margaret speaks into the pa mic
ladies and gentlemen the captain has turned on the seat belt sign
please be sure your seat belts are securely fastened and all carry on items are safely stored in the over head bin or under the seat in front of you
also all personal electronic devices must be switched off at this time
todays flight time to atlanta should be minutes
flight attendants please take your seats
trina straps into her jump seat
heavy rain lashes the nose of the plane
we watch the plane steer on to the glowing center line
whip inhales his coffee and readies himself for take off
evans tries to relax continuing with the checklist
reading the check list elevator trim set
flaps one two three set
one two three altimeters set
lights pitot heat de ice on
southjet wind is one zero zero at seventeen
runway l cleared for take off
whip has razor focus as he places his hand on the throttle
evans sits upright and prepares for battle
keys the mic cleared for take off southjet
whip pushes the throttles and the engines scream as they spool up to full thrust
after a beat he releases the brakes
the passengers are pressed into their seats like blades of grass as the breeze of the planes momentum moves them towards flight
the main lights in the cabin go out and the small glow of the aisle lights lead us back to the cockpit
whip mans the stick as he squints his eyes and tries to keep the nose between the lights of the runway
its like a video game right
whip laughs and turns to his copilot
evans is visibly nervous as he begins the take off check
airspeeds alive both sides
engine instruments are in the green
the jr fishtails as the main gear begins to hydroplane
yep nothing like a little knot cross wind to exercise that sphincter muscle
evans is jostled violently
thats wind shear
a micro burst
whips eyes are focused on the end of the runway
the red threshold lights are approaching fast
the plane is not lifting off
less than a thousand feet to go
whip snaps at him
just watch my airspeed
the airspeed indicator reads
now the air speed indicator climbs to
whip pulls back on the yoke and
the plane jerks up and we can hear the fuselage flex as we leave the ground
the plane is immediately buffeted by severe turbulence
thats wind shear for sure
ride em cowboy
the passengers are rattled like a bag of marbles
the plane is loping up as the rain continues to pound the windshield
the ascent is very bumpy as the turbulent wind tosses the plane side to side
copilot evans is communicating with air traffic control
southjet climbing out of for thousand runway heading
turn left heading one seven zero
climb maintain niner thousand
climb maintain niner thousand
evans quickly dials the heading and altitude into the auto pilot
i dont want the auto pilot
whats your ride like southjet
before evans can answer whip jumps on the radio
ah departure weve got some rough chop here
id say moderate to
the plane hits a severe bump
evans headset turns sideways and he quickly rights it
whip chokes back a nervous chuckle
into his mic no severe
definitely severe turbulence
no meal service today
once again the plane is violently rocked
the passengers audibly howl as the roller coaster dip lifts most of their stomachs into their throats
a few overhead luggage bins fly open and bags and coats rain down
the three attendants calmly collect the luggage and stow it in the kitchen
they talk loudly for the benefit of the passengers
to a passenger this happened last week always bumpy outta orlando
margaret grabs the cabin mic and addresses the passengers
ladies and gentlemen the captain has asked that until we clear this air you stay seated with your seat belts fastened
the plane rocks and shutters
whip seems oblivious as he continues to serenade evans
feelin alright not feelin too good myself feelin alright not feelin too good myself
whip is interrupted by air traffic control
be advised there is a large convective cell four miles at your oclock
and another cell oclock miles
both moving rapidly
did you get that
im just tryin to get birdie here outta this wind bowl
what did they clear us to
were cleared to flight level one eight thousand
evans headset flies off
his tie and all the loose equipment and coffee cups are thrown to the ground
enough of this shit
whip pushes the yoke forward
the plane pitches downward
what are you doing
whip points to the mfd screen
see that sliver of blue sitting between those two ugly bastards
mfd screen a narrow line of blue is visible between the two monstrous convective cells
thats a little pocket of smooth air squatting right over lake kissimmee
evans nervously squints at the screen
and were gonna thread that fucking needle
turn me thirty degrees right
evans jumps on the radio
into his mic center
this is southjet we need to divert degrees right
into his mic for weather
southjet this is jacksonville center
degrees right approved
report back on course
report back on course
whip banks the plane to the right
suddenly the plane falls feet in seconds
a huge air pocket pulls the rug out from under the jr
from the cockpit we can hear the passengers scream
evans holds on to his headset
he cant help you now brother
whip remains cool as he rides more bad air
the plane now bounces rapidly over a non stop succession of speed bumps
the passengers clutch each other as they rattle like bobble head dolls its getting worse
whip pushes the throttle and the year old jackson ridgefield jr accelerates directly into a huge black cloud
he begins to dip the nose level to the ground
why are you leveling off sir
id like to spend less time in this shitty air kenny
is that alright with you
whip pushes the year old jackson ridgefield jr directly into a huge black cloud
he begins to dip the nose towards the ground
were approaching maximum airspeed
im gonna need some speed to punch through this crap
the passengers howl in fear as the plane pitches forward
evans calls out to whip
youre over speeding
the airspeed indicator moves from green right up to the yellow line
whip banks the plane steeply to the right
from the cabin we hear the passengers scream
now atc comes on the radio
uh southjet this is jacksonville center
tell em were climbing
scared and lying badly center
southjet is leaving niner thousand
for flight level
southjet this is center
you need to check your mode c
your transponder indicates youre descending
evans looks at whip panicked
youre useless evans shit
keys the radio
this is southjet weve encountered some bad air here
some pretty severe downdrafts
were in our climb now
the shaking gets incredibly violent
we hear screams from the cabin
evans points to whips airspeed indicator
look at your airspeed
youre too fast for this rough air
im right on the line kenny
right on the line
whip starts to hum the joe cocker song again as he cranes his head up close to the windscreen looking intently at the dark sky
cmon sweetheart show me the sun
suddenly we see a beam of light breaking through the black clouds oclock high
a god ray
whip contd contd finally daylight
whip banks the plane hard lifting the nose pointing it directly at the crack in the darkness
he shoves the throttles to full power
the plane is banking rising and accelerating
the screaming passengers go quiet with the strange new development
the shaking has eased from a to a
whip keeps the plane climbing steeply
the vertical speed indicator shows were ascending feet per minute
the altimeter spins up past ft
the murky grey outside becomes lighter and brighter until suddenly in a dramatic reveal
instantly the air becomes perfectly smooth
whip levels off and maneuvers between the two towering cloud walls smooth as silk
gliding over the fluffy white clouds and through the shimmering rays of the sun it feels like whip just flew the jr into heaven
a joyous cheer erupts from the passenger cabin whip pulls the power back and switches on the auto pilot
evans is cheery almost giddy
glad thats over
whip however is very shaky and beaded with sweat
how tall are we
that was incredible sir
ken turn us north and take us home
evans looks at him and nods
picks up the phone margaret im coming out
whip hangs up puts on his pilot hat and exits the cockpit
nicole has her keys out as she hustles for her door
she looks to find the door slightly open
she pushes it fully open to see fran the building manager standing in her living room holding her camera
he tries to be casual
where you been nicole
she is scared and pissed by his invasion of her space
youre like a little ghost
i never know when youre here
get the fuck out fran
she grabs the full bodied mm camera from him
as the building manager i have a legal right to enter an apartment if i believe the occupant is unwell
especially if said occupant is not current on her rent
he takes a slimy step towards her
she steps away
fran please just gimme a minute
i have the rent
i will bring it down to you
just let me shower
you could just bring the check down now use my shower
i got good water pressure
you know that
fran leans against the door frame trying to strike a seductive pose
nicole smiles and holds up her camera
youre in the perfect light fran
he smiles preening back up a little
fran steps outside and on to the landing
nicole kicks the door shut and locks it escaping fran who calls through the door
tricky tricky girl
alright so you shower up and come down
we dont gotta talk about the check
hang out a lil bit
nicole puts her camera down gently on the table
in your fucking dreams
she now flings her purse on the ground in frustration
the contents spill on to the carpet
amidst the flotsam we focus on yet another candy tin that springs open
nicole fixes her stare at the hypodermic needle resting inside
whip exits the lavatory drying his hands with a towel
he looks down the aisle to see trina far down the cabin
trina sees whip comes back up the aisle and stands with her back to him watching the passengers
whip opens a bottle of orange juice and takes a big swig
he then pours half of it in the sink
whip places the open juice bottle on the liquor cart reaches up and grabs the cabin mic to address the passengers
folks this is captain whitaker
if you look up im here in the galley
i will wave to you
whip steps into the aisle so the passengers can see him
whip waves with a calm smile that would put anyone at ease
i apologize for the bumps but florida just doesnt seem to like us georgians
must be the beatin the bulldogs put on the gators last fall
titters of laughter from the passengers as whip moves the half step he needs to put himself behind the liquor cart
stretch out and relax
the air might stay a little cranky so im gonna ask that you sit tight if you can with your seat belts fastened
we now watch from behind whip as his free hand reaches into the top drawer of the liquor cart and pulls three small vodka bottles out
we wont have beverage service but the girls will walk through with water and snacks and ill have you in atlanta in about minutes
whip puts the mic to its hook
alone in the galley and out of view he quickly empties the vodkas into the orange juice bottle and replaces the cap
whip shakes the juice as he tosses the little empties into the galley trash
whip takes a healthy pull from the spiked juice downing nearly half
whip knocks on the cockpit door
margaret emerges and whip disappears in to the cockpit
framed photos on a bureau show christmas around the tree with mom and dad and a girl whos and a boy whos
in the reflection of this photo we see a flame cooking heroin in a spoon
another photo depicts an year old girls birthday party
in the reflection of this photo see wee nicole tying off
a last photo shows nicole and her mom
they are both wearing kerchiefs
we can see that her mom is gaunt and has no hair under her kerchief
in the reflection of this photo we see the needle injected into her arm
a hypodermic needle is placed in front of that picture
next to the photos is a small cd station that nicole taps to life and turns up
the opening bars of michael fitzpatricks medication begin to play
we pull wide to see nicole pull the bra from her arm that she used to tie off with
her face is pure happiness
clothes and a peach crate filled with camera equipment join a suitcase on its side that acts as a coffee table
nicole picks up her camera and admires it before putting it down
she picks up the cigarette she had staged pre dope fix and reaches for the lighter
she laughs and hums pulls out gum a brush
shes holding the brush when the first heavy wave of narcotic death washes over her
she leans back and uses the wall for support
medication is hitting its chorus
she puts her arms out at her sides euphoria
a slow sloppy smile breaks across her face
she exhales slowly
she reaches for the now burning cigarette when the second wave of heavy drugs hits
nicole looks up with fear
nicole contd contd oh no oh no oh no
she reaches for the little bag of coke that kip gave her
next she grabs her phone flipping it open
as she tries to dial it she crumbles to her knees
nicole somewhat controls her fall to the ground but her eyes are fading
the little bag of coke falls from her fingers
theres no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose
nicoles arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body sinks to the floor
on her back like a girl making angels in the snow as her eyelids flutter she slips away
we hear a pounding on the door
fran is on the other side
open up nicole
i can smell that shit cooking
whip is now passed out in the seat next to evans
he has two approach plates charts folded and tucked between his sunglasses and eyes creating a makeshift sleeping mask
his lower jaw hangs open as his head bobs in deep sleep
margaret leans in through the cockpit door talking to evans
how long has sleeping beauty been out
evans maintains a military posture as he monitors the planes progress
the flight is smooth and the sky appears clear
looks at his watch minutes
were going to start descending any second now
well i guess youll need to wake
the radio interrupts
southjet atlanta center
descend and maintain flight level thousand
descend and maintain thousand
evans dials into the auto pilot but just as he rolls the thumb switch to the descend position
instantly the autopilots shut off sounds
whip jolts awake and pushes up his sleeping shades
the fuck was that
evans grabs his yoke and pulls
the stabilizer feels really stiff
dont force it
evans does we hear a big mechanical snap
referring to the noise that came from the back
i have very little trim control sir
margaret get everybody strapped in tight
margaret runs to the pa leaving the cockpit door open
its pulling right
its locked up ease up on the trim dont
i have no trim at all
the instrument panel lights up like a christmas tree a we lost our hydraulics
whip pulls on his headset and keys his mic
center this is southjet weve lost our hydraulics
and ah shit
pull back the power
evans pulls the throttles to idle
into his mic we lost hydraulics and looks like
also our horizontal stabilizer
southjet atlanta center
understand youve lost hydraulics and stabilizer
turn on the back up pumps
evans engages the emergency hydraulic pumps
center thats affirm
we are in a descent an uncontrolled
the plane starts to bank to the right whip puts his hand against the wing window to stay in his seat
evans grabs his harness with both hands
the passengers shriek with terror
southjet do you wish to declare an emergency
margaret stumbles into the cockpit
everyones belted in
are we going down
the plane suddenly pitches up begins to roll and dives again
get belted in everyone belt in
margaret rushes to the bench in the galley
whip grabs his yoke and pulls
the plane inches up
ive got some control on my side
whips keeps back pressure on his yoke
its stiff as hell
were pitching up
slowing a bit
southjet say your condition
whip continues to give orders to evans
we need drag
throw out everything weve got
keys his mic uh center were in a dive
lost vertical control
evans deploys the landing gear and applies the speed brakes
the wind roars as the gear doors drop
the airframe shakes and rumbles violently
there enough hydraulics to drop the gear
i dont think hydraulics is the problem
throw out the flaps
too fast for flaps
we need to start dumping fuel
evans quickly throws the emrg fuel dump switch
the airplane bucks and drops violently a chorus of terrified screams erupts from the main cabin
whip pulls on his yoke with all of his strength and the dive shallows out a bit
southjet atlanta center
how do you hear
keys his mic atlanta
this is southjet
we are in an uncontrolled dive descending out of
shit i dont know
calls to whip thousand
into his mic thousand
we are declaring an emergency
we are dumping fuel
we have a jammed stabilizer
we need a block of altitude to work the problem
and a heading to the nearest airport
yells to evans im starting to lose it
the yoke pressure pulls whip hard against his harness
hartsfield jackson international is oclock and miles from your present position
maintain block altitude flight level thousand through flight level thousand
turn left heading
well do our best
its getting away from me
i cant hold
dump the flaps
were still fast
the yoke is ripping away from whips hands
evans dumps in the flaps
the jr slows dramatically and balloons up
that bought us a little time
we need to revert to manual control
your side first pul
whip is interrupted by the radio
fuel dump is approved
evans is confused and panicked he throws his hands up
evans look at me
red lever on the floor far side of the console
evans sees it
i got it
pull it up turn it clockwise push it back down
evans does exactly that then pulls back on his yoke nothing
once again the plane pitches into a dive
whip strains to hold on
i cant let go
can you reach mine
evans strains to reach whips reversion pull handle but cant
i cant reach it
evans moves to release his harness but whip stops him
stay strapped in
calls over his shoulder margaret
margaret tumbles into the cockpit catching herself on whips chair
oh god whip
get strapped into the jump seat
i need your help
margaret opens the jump seat and starts to pull on her harness
throughout the scene she is struggling with her harness
margaret see that red lever on the floor next to my chair
the one that says manual control
on the count of three you pull it up turn it clockwise then push it back down
with tears streaming down her cheeks she gives whip a brave nod
here we go
whip releases back pressure from his yoke pushing it forward the plane noses downward degrees
more terrified shrieks come from the back
margaret quickly disengages then re engages the large red handle
whip pulls back on his yoke
the plane pitches up
we got something
its still stiff as hell
evans put in some power
evans pushes up the throttles
whip gingerly applies pressure to his stick
his face fills with worry
i dont know
it feels like the son of a bitch wants to nose over
whips yoke flies out of his hands and slams forward
the plane banks right and drops
he pulls back the power now atc comes on the radio
southjet hartsfield jackson is eleven oclock and niner miles
i see you below
how are you doing
keys his mic not good
you got anything closer
were in a rapid dive here
clayton county is miles at your oclock
were too high
we cant pitch for glide
we have no stabilizer control
the plane continues to drop increasing its nose down attitude and speed
whip pushes both of his feet forward stretching his body to get leverage as we can see him pulling on the yoke trying to get the plane out of the
dive its in
evans is starting to lose it
oh lord were descending at feet per minute out of
heres what were going to do
when i say you retract the gear retract the flaps and trim both ailerons
but every things gonna be opposite so be sure to trim down
what are you gonna do
whip takes margarets hand and puts it on the throttle levers
when i ask for power push both of these forward
whats your sons name
say i love you trevor
you mean trim up
you want me to trim up
the black box
i love you trevor
be a good boy
mommy loves you
what are we doing
why would i trim down
were gonna roll it
here we go
ive got control
just a little barrel roll
let it roll
whips body is fully extended as he pulls back on the yoke and turns into a steep bank
the g force of the roll presses evans away from the console
can you reach it
margaret bends forward and pulls the lever
let it roll
i got it
whip quickly retracts the speed brakes then pushes his yoke full forward
the clumsy liner does a slow ungraceful roll
we watch as the passengers scream as the plane rolls over and they are suspended upside down
the jr finishes its barrel roll skimming over suburban rooftops and trees
a cloud trail of jet a spewing from its wings
as the inverted plane roars overhead the camera pans to find being rushed out of her apartment on a stretcher
the two paramedics and fran the landlord instinctively duck as the jet screams over
at the sight of the jet jesus christ
what the fuck
evans hangs in his harness straps as dust and smoke swirl around him
the inverted wings make an eerie whistling sound as the plane shudders violently side to side
oh lord jesus
whip reaches over and pulls the throttles back
he suddenly seems strangely calm comfortable with his fate
we can maintain altitude like this
trina struggles to stay in her seat as she looks at the passengers hanging
she watches as a young boy loses his grip and flops to the ground
trina unhooks and flops to the ground
we follow her as she runs on the ceiling of the cabin towards the boy
she gets there and starts lifting him towards his father
the atc voice now plays loudly through the entire cockpit
southjet atlanta center
i see your position and a half miles southeast of the airport
descending out of
are you it takes whip a second to find the mic key on his inverted yoke
theres a very pregnant pause
say again sir
did you say inverted
evans seems calmed by whips workaday attitude about their insane tragedy
we hear a horrible metallic grinding sound as the engines become oil deprived
evans pulls the fire bottle handle
whip barks at air traffic control
into his mic three miles and one oclock
into his mic were not gonna make that
a small white church on a hill yards past the church is a soy bean field and a two lane blacktop
into his mic theres a field and a road ah
were gonna put it down in that field
evans is breathing heavy as his face is beet red from the blood rushing to it
evans deploys the right engine fire bottle
into his mic eight hundred descending
we have enough speed to fly
starts to right itself
whip yanks back the throttles
evans and whip deploy every bit of drag they can think of
southjet altitude indicated descending
do you concur
we follow whips eye line that takes us off the control panel and to the windshield
through the windshield we see the landscape and the church steeple getting closer and closer
the plane does a clumsy roll to the right and gets stuck evans pushes the power to full thrust and the plane finishes trina is still struggling to strap herself
in to her jumpseat
the plane rolls
she sees camelia
camelia is tossed across a row of screaming passengers
trina loses her grip and is violently thrown against the galley wall
like a rag doll camelia is hurled down the cabin aisle as the plane plummets
trina slides across the galley floor and cracks her head on the jumpseat
whip frantically spins the trim wheel
we hear a horrific metallic grinding followed by a an unnerving quiet descends over the passenger cabin
the only sound is the wind rushing past the air frame
to himself incredulous are we gliding
gathered near a pond in the churchyard scatter some are wearing long white robes
and in a final ironic cosmic gesture we see whips lower torso being pulled from the wreckage there is swirling smoke and dust small fires
evans strapped in his chair bleeding margaret sobs uncontrollably whips being pulled up a grassy hillside
in the distance whip can see the shattered airplane lying in a crater
fires smoulder around the impact zone
passengers are joined by first responders as they frantically carry drag and walk the injured and the dead from the plane
whip sees a fire truck fly by him down the grassy slope towards the burning plane
looking up at the sky we see black oily smoke billowing across the shattered church steeple we glimpse people rushing past some are wearing white flowing robes looking up at
the ceiling of an ambulance two emts are urgently attending to him
a halogen overhead light and an air conditioning vent brown stained acoustic ceiling tiles we hear the rhythmic beep of a heart monitor whips eyes open to see the halogen
overhead lights of a hospital room
he turns his head slightly to see the flicker of a tv with no sound
a news show runs a loop of eye witness cell phone footage of the plane turning over and crashing belly down
a man who has been watching the tv turns to see that whip is awake
the man turns off the tv gets up and approaches whips bedside
whip knows him
charlie anderson is a late s former military pilot who carries that familiar air of texas comfort and entitlement
how you feelin whip
initial reports look like you pulled some move up there kid
you saved a lot of lives
whip is moved by the first realization of survival
charlie moves close to deliver the news
souls on board including the flight crew and of them survived the crash
six people died
are the rest badly hurt
whod we lose on the crew
a nurse enters the room
charlie nods to her
listen protocol is the ntsb has to make the first contact with you and the agent is here
let me go get him
charlie ducks out of the room
whip is alone and still getting his bearings
he goes to scratch his head and catches sight of his left hand
its swollen and sore his wrist is bandaged with a splint brace
he now looks at both of his hands in wonder
whip hears a muffled conversation that gets clearer as do the images of many people entering the room
a police officer accompanies a doctor and two ntsb agents
an ntsb agent holds a small voice recorder towards whip
captain william whitaker
nod if you can hear me and understand me
im craig matson from the ntsb and im required as the lead on the go team to make an initial contact with you after a major incident like the one
you had today
whip nods as his senses are getting sharper
you are in a hospital in south atlanta
are you aware that you were piloting a plane that went down
i have a doctor here who can explain your medical situation
whip offers a thumbs up gesture
the doctor steps in
im doctor kenan and the good news is that you are in good condition
you did suffer a concussion which is the reason you have a bit of blurred vision and a headache
you have numerous lacerations around your left eye
were going to leave the patch on for a few days as a precaution
but it seems your eye is ok
mris show strained tendons in your left knee and ankle but you didnt break any bones
you have some deep bruising in your left thigh and you have a few torn ligaments in your left wrist
so as soon as we clear you from the concussion and you feel well enough you can go home
that could be a day could be days
whip quietly nods
the doctor leaves and whip begins to study his body
his left leg is wrapped his left wrist has a splint brace i wont ask too much of you tonight but as i said the ntsb is required to make
how much do you remember about the flight
whip looks at the ntsb officer and slowly speaks
i remember everything until the crash
whips voice is failing him as his throat is sore and dry
whitaker thats fine
i am required to inform you that this incident did result in the loss of life
checks an index card the most current information states that of the souls on board we lost
crew members and passengers
people were treated and released
people remain in the hospital and of those cases are listed as critical
who on the crew died
two flight attendants checks a note card camelia satou and katerina marquez whip tries to exhale as the loss of trina sinks in
the rep from your pilots union mr
anderson will act as our contact for you
its important to follow your unions guidance on press and media
the pilots union works closely with the ntsb
so im gonna head out
good luck mr
whip nods as the ntsb officer leaves with the police and other officials in tow
charlie returns to whips side
i knew trina marquez
we spent some time together
apparently she wasnt strapped in
a survivor reported that she was assisting a kid
charlie tries to put a reassuring hand on whips shoulder
hows margaret thomason
checks his notes broken collar bone cuts banged up but shes okay
shes here too
ken evans your copilot took a bad shot to the head
theyre keepin him in a coma to let the brain swelling go down
hes listed as critical but we feel good about him
hes gonna be okay
whip lets that information land as his head is swirling
charlie why are you here
im flying a desk now
im a regional rep for the iap
youre the rep for the pilots union
im one of a few union reps for the southeast
when your plane went down all the reps got a page and since i know you i shot my hand up and said i wanted to come and be the
first face youd see
im glad its you
whip starts to weep as he needs to begin the long process of expressing this trauma
its good to see you too cowboy
youre gonna be okay
were gonna take care of you
thats my job
whip nods as he wipes his eyes on his heavily bandaged hand
the union will put out a statement on your behalf
condolences to the families who lost loved ones and gratitude to the brave men and women on the flight crew
and i know you and deana have been divorced for a while but maybe she and your son
yeah how olds he now
wow you werent even married when we flew for delta

do you want me to reach out to deana and see if she and will want to come
any family you want here well get them here stat
whip thinks about his long since fractured family
no ill call her
speaking of which i have your phone and some of your personal effects from the plane
charlie has a zip locked bag with his phone keys sunglasses and wallet
whip looks at them odd to see them encased in plastic
your clothes are toast
do you need me to get you some stuff
no im okay
ill take care of it
im gonna head out let you get some rest
im coming back
youll see plenty of me
charlie hands whip his card
thanks charlie i really
whip begins to crack it means a lot to me that you came
get some rest now
charlie that plane was fucked
the way you landed that plane was nothing short of a miracle
whip nods trying to pull it together
charlie pats whips shoulder before he leaves
whip sits up and pulls his phone from the plastic bag
yeah its whip
im in a hospital in south atlanta
you know where i am
okay well fuck
yeah im okay
well im looking to get outta here
but listen i need you to bring me something to wear
i dont know clothes and smokes i really need smokes
tee shirt sweat pants
ill put you on the visiting list
just be low key no fucking around harling
i need cigarettes
whip closes his eyes and exhales
he now stares at the foot of the bed for a long long moment
whip squeezes his eyes shut tight holding back tears
then quietly as if whispering a prayer
the stones sympathy for the devil kicks up as we wait
the doors split open and harling mays steps out
harling has a pony tail and a goatee and is probably wearing a tommy bahama button down shirt
we follow harling as he strides down the hall
with ear buds in harling points a sanyo pistol shaped cam corder at the attending nurse at the nurses station recording her
im on the list baby girl
check the list for mr
the stones continue to wail as harling strolls on adjusting the duffel bag he has slung over his shoulder
harling stands in the doorway looking in
the morning nurse is helping whip to stand
harling points his camcorder at whip and the nurse
if this is gonna turn into a sponge bath ill come back
harling immediately goes to whip and supports him
its okay harling
thats right honey im on the list
some say they harling knew me
harling boxes her out
she steps away
honey can you hustle us a couple of daiquiris and a cocktail weenie
on second thought just bring the booze
i brought my own weenie
no reaction as the nurse collects the trash and towels
harling focuses his camcorder on the nurse and leaves whip in an unsteady stance
harling films her and comments
shes offended and she should be
im a pig
and i hate me
thats what we have in common nurse ratched
we both hate me
and shes gone
harling turns to whip
what the fuck my man
theyre sayin sweet jesus what a fuckin stud that pilot is
youre a hero no shit
you will never pay for another drink in this life time
there is crazy news people all over look at this shit harling helps whip to the window
from whips window we can see a slew of news vans with signal towers as well as reporters milling about a small zoo
harling and whip stare for a moment at the circus below
whip doesnt last long and slowly returns to the bed as harling continues to gawk
classic hero worship youre a rock star man
you gotta see the video ive got im making a doc about you well us yknow
harling pulls an ipad out of his knapsack and flips it open
he lets a collection of videos run
this is outside your condo
on harlings ipad we see footage of press swarming outside whips condo
we also see the crash scene footage
look thats me and that s mark mellon
you know that douchey talking haircut from local atlanta channel
i said a few words
just straight talk yknow
whips hands shake as he grabs the bed frame
harling takes notice and stashes the ipad
you okay captain whitaker
harling helps him get settled
we see the beads of sweat on whips lip and forehead
the meds theyre giving me are fucking me up im all shaky and dried out
i cant sleep good
harling immediately picks up the small paper cup that holds whips pain meds
he fishes out the two pills and stares at them
harling shakes his head
thats generic xanax and this hydrocodone is generic vicodin
its shit prolly canadian
harling casually tosses the pills down his gullet and expertly swallows them without water
he grabs whips medical chart and scours it as he prattles on
we want the premium stuff
not the fucking well shit
wheres the dihydromorphinone
or just some fucking palladone would suffice
what is this
fucking amateur hour over here
get that goddamned doctor in here
you just saved a people from death they should get your fuckin meds right
calls to the door listen harling leave it alone
so you got my message and decided not to call me back
did you bring me smokes
i decided to come by instead
and yes i got your fucking message and yes i brought you smokes
harling hands whip a pack of smokes from his pocket
he also pulls out a carton of smokes from his backpack
here is a fresh carton enjoy
you fucking earned it you smoke your nuts off champion
if i were you id fire up right here in the god damn room
fuckem youre immortal youre a fucking god man
whip motions with his hands to calm down
this is big time man
youre a hero in a time when we really need heroes
shut the fuck up harling
six people died
when are you gonna take yes for an answer
pick up the phone man
harling pulls something from his vest pocket and puts it in whips hand
whip looks at it and back at harling
heres a pint of smirnoff and a few red bulls
you know what im sayin
i know my customer
harling continues to pull items from the bag
harling take the vodka with you
harling freezes his frenzied energy with this odd command
take the vodka
dude are you insane
im gonna just tuck it in the bottom of your take the fucking vodka
harling hears him this time and raises his hand and nods putting the vodka back in his own duffel
harling tosses a tee shirt sweat pants and flip flops on the bed then
check it out
harling holds up a silk japanese happi coat with elaborate stitching depicting colorful birds flying around mt
look im tired man
you rest up
you gotta come and get me tomorrow
whip pulls his keys from the bag that charlie gave him
here are my keys
go to the condo and bring me some nice clothes i can wear my phone charger and grab the veal outta my fridge
yeah the veal thats in my freezer
done and done
what time you need me here

ive been in hospitals
i know what you need
jugs hot milfs in heat
you should just stroke it all day
youre a hero know what im saying
if i was in here id be jerkin it all day long
see theres a smile
harling puts his hand on whips forehead in an attempt to reassure him
a quiet moment before harling slips out
whip wakes up in a cold sweat
he is breathing heavy as he scans the room
lightening flashes from outside the window
whip looks to the night stand where we see a pack of nicotine gum has been chewed through
whip uses his hands to get to the edge of the bed
he roots through the duffle bag that harling left and finds a pack of smokes and a bic lighter still in its package
determined to smoke whip eyes a wheel chair that has been placed next to his bed
leaning against the wheelchair is a medical cane
wearing his happi coat or robe whip limps in to the empty hallway with the use of his cane
he checks the quiet corridor as he begins his quest
the door swings open and no one appears to be on the other side
now whip fights to push the heavy door open again to slip through
a hand grabs the door and holds it
whip walks into the sanctity of the stairwell
we find the owner of the helping hand was nicole who returns to a quiet spot along the wall of the stairwell as she demurely smokes a cigarette
whip leans his cane against the wall and carefully pulls a pack of smokes from his pocket
i didnt think anyone would have the same devious thought about using the fire stairs to have a smoke
nicole smiles and looks down awkward around men when she is not loaded
she drops her cigarette which we see was barely smoked as she maneuvers to leave
ill be quiet
he offers her a cigarette she takes it
we dont have to talk
be nice to just smoke with someone
and they do
they sit in silence as the stairwell fills up with smoke
after a long beat
were you on the plane
whip studies her shes beautiful in an exhausted way
yeah i was
nicole shakes her head
where were you sitting
up near the front
again it falls silent as we let them smoke and think in the sanctity of the fire stairs
a voice breaks their silence
tobaccos but an indian weed grows green in the morn cut down at eve it shows our decay we are but clay
i love the smell of nicotina in the morning
we hear a metallic rattle and whip and nicole look to the stairs
dont flee dear comrades
really wait for me please
a gaunt young man makes his way to their landing
he is dressed in a hospital gown and carrying an i
pole on which hangs a small bag of clear liquid
the mans hair has completely left him
his skin is gray
eyes hollowed from his battle with cancer
can i bum a smoke
whip offers him a cigarette
he takes it and fires it up with a lighter he keeps stowed in the pocket of his gown
i should quit my cancer might get cancer
you guys in the plane crash
whip looks at the ground as the gaunt young man studies him
it hits him youre the fucking pilot
nicole gives whip a look
i saw you on tv
holy shit man
tough deal but you walked away or it looks like you limped away
yeah im lucky
goin home tomorrow
home for me is the basement they keep cancer treatment in the basement
im livin here
youre living here
im dying here
what kind of cancer
fibro mixzoid sarcoma soft tissue sarcoma
very rare god chose me
gaunt young man laughs
god chose you
you believe in god
fuck yeah bitch
youre a stupid fucker if you dont believe in god
the god topic has silenced the stairwell
as soon as you realize that the random events in your life are god
you will live a much better life
you spend your life believing that you have all the control over what happens
the plane youre flying goes down
out of your control
god gives you cancer
i have no control over that
did god give me cancer
you bet your ass god gave me cancer
you think if i begged for cancer god would have given it to me
because i assure you i have begged for god to take it away and guess what
i have no control over that
gaunt young man smokes the cig to the nub and rubs the remains against the smooth concrete wall
can i get another smoke
whats wrong with you honey
youre beautiful do you know that
do i scare you
people either have to pretend they dont see me or theyre drawn to me
its funny because people see me as being close to the other side they feel like i have power or wisdom
they think i have the answers
maybe i do
death gives you perspective
i lived my life so indecisive in a haze
but now that im dying everything is so clear
it all makes sense somehow
im sorry but i cant get over how beautiful you are
look at your arm you an addict
nicole looks at him
whats your name
what do you do in the world nicole
she laughs what a question
i was a photographer and then i was a masseuse and i wash hair at a salon sometimes
where is it
ill come by im easy you can wash my head
do you think youre gonna die
nicole laughs to keep from weeping
youre not gonna die
the men watch as nicole quietly cries its powerful
dont you love her
i dont know her
bullshit i do
random act of god
dont think so
survive a plane crash to meet a gorgeous girl in a stairwell
fuck you man
he reflects then
im sure theyre looking for me
my family just showed up from utah
you know its bad when they start flying in
every morning is special now im so grateful
its a trip wish i could bottle this feeling i have
about how beautiful every breath of life is
gaunt young man starts laughing
whip joins him
can i get a smoke for the road
heres a pack
thank you ill pass them out in the cancer ward
take care nicole youre gonna be okay
the gaunt young man leaves clanging away with his i
nicole wipes away her tears we see her hospital bracelet as well as her track marks
chemo makes you pretty foggy
they call it chemo brain my mom used to slur her words and get all chatty
your mom had cancer
breast cancer she was only
but whyd that guy ask you if you were gonna die
i flat lined twice in the ambulance
heroin addicts who use needles tend to die
especially women for some reason
is that right
i have a pamphlet to prove it
a girl from aa just came to see me that guy was a trip
he made it feel like i dunno
we were the last people left on the planet
drops her smoke and together we should save the world
nicole steps on her cigarette and puts the nub in her pocket
she begins to leave
whip stops her
well where should we live
if were gonna save the world where should we do that
you dont want me
you dont want me either
nicoles laugh tapers off as she senses his honesty
where do you live
why you wanna come visit
silence between them i live in bankhead its south atlanta near the bus station
the luxurious bus station
ill come visit you
whats your address
she measures him
i live at the georgian gardens on taylor street
how long are you staying here
trying to stay as long as i can but i dont have insurance to cover rehab
ill prolly be out tomorrow
and youre a masseuse
what kind of masseuse
ive been every kind of masseuse there is
there is strong tension between them
an orderly busts through the down the stairs
this breaks their stare
good luck nicole
whip leaves nicole where he found her
whip is wheeled out of a service exit by an orderly who also holds the duffle bag of whips stuff around his neck
whip no longer wears the eye patch but has a butterfly bandage over his left eye brow
harling jumps out of his cadillac sts and immediately takes over grabbing the duffel bag
the orderly tries to hand whip a medical file
harling snatches it
yeah thanks mike
harling tips him heres american
good luck sir
harling hugs whip who hangs on tight
the orderly spins the chair around and heads back inside
harling uses his key fob to remotely pop the trunk and stow whips duffel
this is how they get the stones out of madison square garden man
smoked black limos fly outta the vip driveway and the fans jump on the limos
meanwhile mick and the boys go out the service exit into delivery vans casual rock star type shit
harling helps him into the front seat and they pull away
the stones gimme shelter starts to play
as they drive off we see media mayhem collected in front of the hospital
trucks with towers cameramen stringers and newscasters add to catering trucks and coffee stands as the vultures wait for the carrion of sound bytes and footage of survivors
whip watches through the rear window the media circus disappears as the caddy rounds a corner
the back seat is piled with whips clothes most of them still on hangers
harling lights a cigarette and hands one to whip who takes it
i couldnt find any suitcases so i just put your shit in grocery bags
harling pulls a cold becks from a cooler on the floor of the back seat and uses a bottle opener thats been screwed to the dash of his car next
to the radio to open the beer
he offers the beer to whip who waves it off
harling gladly keeps it for himself
gimme shelter continues to play
so youre stayin with me down on university right
a lotta young people
harling tosses whip a freezer bag marked veal whip begins to open it
im gonna go to the farm
the fucking farm
my dads place
i cant stay at my condo
i thought you sold that fucking place
im not sure i wanna stay at the farm
just take me to the airport to get my car
whip finishes opening the freezer bag its full of cash
harling starts to laugh
dont you know the first place every two bit thief looks is in the freezer
whips buick turns off the blacktop past a small weathered billboard whitaker crop dusting
also a real estate for sale sign is posted in front
whip pulls into a long dirt driveway that approaches a one story farm house
he gets out of the car
with his cane in one hand he uses his free hand to toss the grocery bags close to the steps and heads inside
whip ambles in and we see the interior of the house bears the fading patina of a proud american family
we see photos whip in his naval flyer uniform
a group military photo a squadron of naval fliers on a carrier
whips parents next to the farm house
whips father stands next to whip who is holding his infant son
whip empties his pockets onto the desk top
his keys wallet and his cell phone are placed next to an old rotary phone attached to an old answering machine
whip plugs in his cell phone charge dials in for his messages and puts it in speaker mode as we hear
you have messages
captain whitaker this is jim court im with cnn
wed like to schedule an interview
he deletes that message message two
this is nbc affiliate kgat in athens were looking to contact william j
he deletes and moves on message three
captain whitaker this is karen james media relations with the pilots union
whip again deletes the message and decides to just shut the phone down
he continues to empty his pockets
in his jacket pocket he finds a prescription bottle of pain pills
whip holds it up opens it and pours a few out in his hand
whip pours the pain pills into the toilet
he then opens the medicine cabinet and starts to empty all of the bottles into the toilet
whip goes to the collection of liquor bottles next to the sink that act as a makeshift bar
he picks up a bottle of vodka
he unscrews the cap and sniffs the contents
he slowly tips the bottle and pours it into the sink
whip opens the refrigerator and removes an assortment of beers
he pops them open and pours them in the sink
the faucet running to offset the pungent smell
whip opens a dresser drawer and finds a couple of zip lock bags of bud hidden under the socks
whip dumps the weed into the toilet and flushes it
a cigarette dangles from whips mouth as he ferrets around the room showing the focus and determination of a serial killer cleaning his kill site
he finds rolling papers roaches more liquor and weed he reaches into the shell bag thats hanging next to the shotgun rack and finds another pint
whip opens the freezer to put in his frozen dinner and his packet of veal and finds another fifth of vodka
he pours the vodka in the sink and tosses the bottle into the trash which is piled high with empties
through the kitchen window whip sees the farms old weathered barn
whip furrows his brow
whip slides open the heavy barn doors to reveal a vintage cessna covered in dust and bird shit from the years of stagnant storage
whip lights a smoke as he marvels at the little piece of aviation history resting in his barn
whip walks past the plane and starts to examine the large two story open ceilinged barn that is junked full of farm equipment and old furniture
his grandfather father and whip pose next to the barn
a crop duster acts as the background for a picture with a year old whip and his father next to a small plane
a series of pictures feature the plane in flight and shots taken from the plane aerials of the farm etc
whip holds the framed shot of he and his dad as he walks back to the plane resting his arm on the wing
whip pulls himself from the wall of photos and stares at his stuff
we recognize what must be the stuff he took from his house after his divorce
we see bikes weights and fishing gear
whip rummages through a box of things packed from his home office
trophies sports memorabilia citations a photo of he and his wife from happier times
their wedding photo
now whip comes upon a framed black and white photo of he and charlie in their younger navy days wearing flight suits and standing on a carrier flight deck in
front of an f tomcat
big smiles full of hotshot pilot swagger
whip puts the photo back and spots his golf bag
he roots out a pint of cheap vodka from the inner pocket
next he finds a fifth of bourbon in his bicycle saddle bag
he goes to the workbench and removes a couple of bottles from the paint shelf
whip dumps out the liquor onto the grass as he hobbles back to the house
whip uses just his cane now as he drags a garbage bag full of empty liquor bottles to his garbage cans
he tosses the bag of empties in a can
his work done whip lights a smoke and stares at the empty fields that run forever as does the landscape of his mind
he quietly tries to grasp the horror he endured and the reality of his survival
we hear the microwave beep and whip retrieves a frozen dinner
whip sits at the coffee table eating his frozen dinner while watching news coverage of the crash
whip is startled by the phone that never rings
he snaps off the tv using the remote
whip is in no hurry to answer the phone as the old time ring continues
whip goes to the desk where the phone rests and he watches the old answering machine click on
youve reached the whitaker crop dusting company flying lessons and plane rides
please leave a message and it will be returned
i think that was the beep
hey cowboy its charlie again
whip reaches for the phone but decides to just listen to speaking to voicemail im back in town and i stopped by the hospital tonight but they said you went
so i guess youre feelin pretty good but um we went out to your condo and the manager said you had not returned
charlie sits at a beautiful wooden table in a modern glass walled office above a baseball field
the table is populated with casually dressed businessmen and lawyers as this after hours meeting was called on the fly
crash scene photos and files fill the table top
we also see a photo or two of the whitaker farm
you may be with relatives which i understand
i was really hoping to see you for breakfast
im at the st
theres an executive buffet on the th floor oclock okay
if you get this please come
some important stuff to cover
whip stands still as a beep sounds ending the message
the executive buffet is a staple at the st
a long center table with silver trays houses eggs and breakfast meats
fruit bagels and a staff of servers cater to the business elite of atlanta
charlie anderson sits at a corner table with hugh lang a young well dressed african american man
charlie and hugh are chatting in jocular spirit when whip approaches walking much more confidently with his cane
whip hey buddy
glad you got my message
grab a seat
whip studies hugh as he pulls out his chair
whip this is hugh lang hes an attorney from chicago
hugh stands and shakes hands with whip
nice to meet you captain whitaker
whip and hugh remain standing both feeling a little alpha
whip nods sits miss can we get some fresh coffee
she smiles and nods
shes off to get the coffee
we were just talking about your copilots wife
she told a newspaper that god landed that plane
god landed the plane
whip just stares at the two men who have large buffet plates surrounding them
i too believe that god landed that plane
the same way i believe that god should hit the buffet the turkey sausage is excellent
im good with coffee
len caldwell was really trying to get here this morning
whip seems lost len is the president of the pilots union and he wanted to be here with us and meet with you but they wanted him at the crash
whip is quiet anxious to hear the purpose of the meeting
whip as you know when a plane crashes the ntsb sends a go team to the crash site immediately
they find the flight data recorders
yes they found them perfectly intact
that solves everything
the recorders will tell the story
why do we need a lawyer from chicago
hughs an attorney who specializes in criminal negligence criminal negligence
the waitress returns with the coffee
its quiet as they wait for her to finish
death demands responsibility
six dead on that plane someone has to pay
the plane fell apart at thousand feet
the airline will try to prove equipment failure
which would make the manufacturer responsible
the manufacturer of the plane will try to prove poor maintenance of the equipment by the airline
or pilot error
i had to fly that plane inverted that means upside down hugh
do you get the picture
passengers hanging upside down feet off the ground
do you have any idea what that sounds like
i heard the black box last night
are you a pilot
no im not
then you dont know what the fuck youre talking about
hughs on our team and its the ntsbs ball game
they run the investigation and they will ultimately rule on the cause
they interview the entire flight crew and the passengers
charlie what do i need to know
im already tired of this guy
the ntsb go team collects blood skin and hair from the flight crew for a toxicology report
whip studies the two men trying to read their poker hands
when did they do that
in the hospital
its the first thing they do
do you remember having your blood drawn on the night of the crash
whip looks at charlie and then to hugh
do they have the results of these blood tests
yeah they do
the waitress checks in
anything else for you gentlemen
did i just see warm cinnamon rolls come out
bring me one wouldya
actually bring me two okay sweetie
an awkward silence as they wait for her to clear out
an initial report shows alcohol in your bloodstream at a level of
in the u
one of the most lenient drunk driving countries in the world you go to jail for driving with a number over
and by driving i mean a car
they all digest the information as the waitress delivers the cinnamon rolls
its still quiet
what does that mean
i had a beer the night before i flew
that made the tail of the plane explode
separate issues whip i need a lawyer
hugh is your lawyer
i need a bigger lawyer
a lawyer who understands that i flew a broken plane and without me at that stick thered be funerals not
were talking about prison not funerals
somebody has to write checks well its not me i promise you that
and as long as theyre writing checks write me one because someone put me in a broken plane
id love a check
this tox report states that you were drunk and high on cocaine felonies punishable by years in jail
and if your intoxication is proven to have caused the death of the passengers youll get counts of manslaughter
that could be life in prison
can i now do my job on your behalf and kill this tox report
whip is listening
charlie tries to reign it in
hell get it done whip
its what his entire life is about
trust me trust him
whip stares at hugh dont worry whip youre gonna walk away the hero you deserve to be
im not worried charlie
i promise you that
no one could have landed that plane like i did no one
the waitress returns with a coffee pot
close on tv a split screen cnns piers morgan on one side of the screen asking questions of jim tilmon an aviation expert
captain tilmon we wanna play a portion of the black box that all of the news outlets have grabbed hold of
when i ask for power push both of these forward
whats your sons name
the bartender steps up to serve whip
whatll you have
can i get an orange juice
the bartender leaves to grab the orange juice
television the transcription and audio of the cockpit recording continues
say i love you trevor
the black box
i love you trevor
be a good boy
mommy loves you
the bartender returns with the orange juice
and a double shot of stoli
the bartender nods and turns in acknowledgement of the order
that audio paints a strong picture
captain whitaker is surely a hero in my opinion
however every incident is different
the actions of the pilots on southjet will be heavily scrutinized
its protocol for any investigation
the bartender returns with a frosted glass and pours two shots over the ice
whip downs the vodka in a flash
the other bartender has the remote and starts searching for more coverage of the crash
he stops at a local report
a reporter gives a lead in at the crash site
kevin its still chaotic here at the site
apparently a small ministry was conducting services near to where the plane came down
so the scene here is a mix of survivors and first responders i was able to catch up with an actual passenger moments ago
we were in a nose dive and people were screaming and yelling and then the plane turned upside down and we had to hold on to our seat belts to
keep from falling out of our chairs i saw one kid fall to the floor and this flight attendant picked him up and handed him to his dad
i didnt see her again
more details and more reports of the casualties are continuing to fly around
i can tell you that there appears to be many many survivors
thats all i have for now
another reporter has a passengers account
rebecca surviving passengers are being put in ambulances police cruisers and even first responder vehicles and they are being taken to local hospitals for treatment
some of the injured appear serious and its safe to assume at this point that there are at least a few fatalities
lets roll the tape of the passenger i caught up with earlier
a man with short dark hair explains his experience
we turned like a corkscrew and all i could think was this is really happening im going to die and then all of a sudden the plane was upside down
but steady and the pilot must have known how to fly it that way
he flipped it back over and landed it hard
obviously a harrowing ordeal for those on the troubled plane
this is callie j kenner for news
a third reporter gets a female neighbors perspective
folks in the houses that border this field came running from their houses
i thought it was thunder at first
but it shook the ground hard
thunder dont do like that
i ran outside and i could hear people yelling and i could see a small fire at first
i just took the dogs and headed down there
then i saw the plane crumpled on the ground
i never seen nothing like that in my life
just like that plane this community is shattered
folks here remain on edge as media trucks continue to line their small road and crowd the field where the plane still lies
back to you tom
a news light shines on a lone reporter who stands atop a small hill above the crash field
were gonna take another look at the cell phone footage that captured the last moments of southjets flight
after the plane levels off and smacks down in the field we return to reporter in the crash field
many hours have passed since the footage you just watched but the crash site remains active as investigators work through the night
using flood lights and miners caps teams continue to comb the crash field looking for the answers to the hard questions as to what brought down southjets flight
those answers remain in darkness as do the broken pieces of the aircraft
hopefully sunlight will bring answers
for now this is kent johnson reporting
a pack of beer hits the passenger seat as whip climbs behind the wheel
whip cracks open a handle half gallon of vodka and takes a liberal pull
whips shoulders relax as the alcohol kicks in
after a moment he starts the car shifts into gear downs another huge slug of vodka and pulls out
whip is at the wheel
a cigarette in one hand an open beer in the other
he cruises slowly searching street signs with his beer buzzed eyes
taylor street taylor st
ah here we are
whip rolls the buick to a stop and scans the street
whip spots a sign georgian gardens apartments suddenly nicole flies into frame and tosses a box into the back of her toyota
she hustles off leaving the hatchback open
whip raises an eyebrow and drives toward the building
whip parks his car at a fire hydrant right in front of nicoles building and gets out with his cane
he pops a fresh beer and looks at the building looking for a proper entrance
he notices fran walking quickly along the second story balcony carrying a baseball bat
whip thinks nothing of it and begins casually poking through the stuff in nicoles car a random collection of junk including clothes and photographs mostly of rock bands performing
now whip hears an argument escalating between fran and the guy in unit just told me you stayed here last night
franny relax im just getting my shit outta here okay
what about the rent
you owe me he heads off
whip does a decent job of making his way up the exterior staircase
that beer is making his leg feel a little better
whip moves more aggressively up the stairs as the argument who do you think broke down this fucking door to let the paramedics in there
you gotta pay for all this
just let me get my shit and get outta here
i will pay you when i can
i know just take a shower with me
how hard is that
im not doin that
if i had a bag a dope youd be on your knees in my shower right now right
gimme the camera for collateral
whats it worth
no fucking way
i will kill you if you touch this camera
i will pay for all of this
i will pay okay
whip crests the top of the staircase to see
fran the landlord wielding a baseball bat as he berates nicole
nicole has her full bodied mm camera hanging from a strap around her neck
fran points the bat at her head
whip whacks fran with his cane
the fuck are you doin
fran stumbles and falls as the bat goes flying to the ground and rolls away
whip licks the foaming top of his excited beer
gives whip a puzzled hey dont i know you
whip jabs him again with his cane
keep your fucking hands off her
nicole who is crying now laughs in relief
she cant believe it
americas hero has just come to her rescue
whip moves to comfort her
is this all the stuff you want from here
nods again recovering just this stuff
she points to a camera tripod and a box of broken portfolios with photos dripping out
okay start taking that stuff down
fran has gotten up and stands a safe distance from whip
she owes me bucks
you wanna spend a thousand bucks suing her and get jack shit
or do you want to make a cash deal with me
give me in cash
youre a creep
with your baseball bat bullshit
whip flings his beer at frans head then pulls out his billfold
sorts through his cash ill give you in cash
whip throws the money on the floor
fran sorts the options
he tentatively bends down and picks up the cash
keeping a wary eye on whip
now help her get that box in her car
my car doesnt run
it wont start
im taking this with me
your car doesnt run
what were you gonna do
i dont know what i was gonna do
whip drills fran with his eyes
with deliberate malice then put the fucking box in my car
frans smirk fades
he relents and picks up the box as whip grabs the lighter shoulder bag and they head downstairs
nicole stares out the window as the city disappears
whip pulls a beer from the box and offers it to nicole
nicole smiles thinks about it
she shakes her head no
whip pops the top and takes a drink
whats your name
whip looks to her she to him
they begin to laugh at the absurdity
when it subsides
a long moment quietly passes
thank you captain whip
smokey robinson and the miracles you really got a hold on me plays as whip eases himself into a recliner using his cane
on the small table next to him rests his beer and an unopened bottle of bourbon with a glass of ice
whip cracks the seal on the bourbon bottle and pours a drink
he takes a sip and chases it with his beer
whip now starts to remove the brace that we clearly see under his basketball shorts
as he takes it off he tries to massage his aching leg
nicole enters the living room fresh from a shower
whip studies her shes beautiful and innocent
i was gonna lay down get some rest
whip takes another sip before returning to massaging his leg
is it really okay that i stay here
i want you to stay
nicole walks over to whip and kneels down and gently takes over massaging his leg
that feels better
its throbbing because the blood is having a hard time getting back to your heart
nicole continues to soothe his aching leg
after a moment nicole stands and takes the drink out of whips hand and sets it down
she now bends down and kisses him softly
she now stands and takes his hand leading him in to the bedroom
whips been awake for hours as he sits at the foot of the bed
whips wearing a long sleeve tee shirt and sweat pants and no shoes
he looks at nicole sleeping angelically on her side of the bed
whip watches her sleep for a long moment until
he hears something
he gets up and goes to the window
its a car pulling up the driveway
whip opens the door to find hugh in his driveway
whip casts a strange figure with his bare chest boxers and brandishing a shotgun
they stare at each other
do you wanna shoot me or can i come inside
ill shoot you inside
hugh walks closer to the porch
whip questions him
you just decided to drop by
your voice mail is full and you never answer your cell phone
i called your cell times
i turned it off
hugh nods as the explanation lands
i thought wed take a ride
whip measures hughs intention
okay gimme a minute
hugh nods and recedes from the door as whip goes to get dressed
whip joins hugh on a rectangular platform on top of a two story scaffolding frame
the platform provides a perfect view of flight s final resting area
we see the awesome devastation that tons of metal flying at miles an hour can do to a hillside
you can see the initial impact sheared the right wing clean off
if only the left wing had come off at impact i think everyone would have walked off that plane
the left wing partially pulled away it snapped but stayed connected to the airframe
so it whipped back towards the plane hit the fuselage in front of the tail
if you were sitting in the last or rows on the left side it was like being hit by a train
i drank a lot the night before that flight
i drank that morning too and i used coke to straighten up
i know its in the toxicology report
but thats not the reason this happened
whip looks at hugh expecting him to finish his thought
hugh holds his look for a beat before changing thoughts
the john the baptist pentecostal mission
we hear voices a low murmur that gets louder chanting
whip looks to the top of the hill to see
a minister in a dark purple cloak calls from the new testament as the congregation responds in unison
he will wipe away every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore for the former things have
revelation there are at least people sitting in white folding chairs at the foot of the hill
a small brook babbles behind them
whip continues to take in the bizarre scene
they helped pull survivors out of the wreckage
now they come out here every day and have a mass minutes prior to the crash
and then they sit in silent prayer for minutes at
which is when you went down
whip is overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crash field and the worshippers
whip looks back at the crash site to see
inside the crash site a small group of investigators with ntsb jackets following the lead of a confident woman
hugh answers the question in whips mind
ellen block shes the head of the investigation for the ntsb
shes the one thats gonna ask the tough questions
whyd you bring me here
i needed you to see this
you trying to scare me
i need to know that you can handle all this
whip continues to stare at the awesome dent in the earth
there was a mechanical issue with the plane but what you and i know
is that this was an act of god
im gonna fight to get the ntsb to place act of god on the probable causes list
whos god would do this
its quiet before hugh makes his case
so heres the deal
avington carr the owner of the airline is on our side
and hes got big friends in washington
he wants to sit down with us
oclock tomorrow morning
whips had enough
he starts to walk away
hugh stops him
you cant drink
youre under the microscope
you cant be out buying liquor
no bars no drugs
i can stop
hugh stays quiet i told you i can stop
i wont drink
oclock tomorrow morning with mr
carr the owner of the airline
a huge office with a glass wall that looks out over the diamond
we are high above the outfield if god was a baseball fan this would be his office
we now meet avington carr a very righteous and self satisfied wealthy southern gentlemen
i never wanted that fuckin airline
neither did my brother
carr scans the room reading faces holding court
it was my father that wanted it
i like baseball
ornate wood furniture helps to announce the political feel of mr
presidential photos and commendations pepper the walls
i like baseball
everyone looks to hugh as it gets oddly silent
we get our first look at len caldwell the president of the pilots union
len tries to wrest some control and exude some confidence
everyone in georgia likes baseball
so whats the deal lenny
is your union gonna survive this one
how big a check you think im gonna have to write
there were fatalities on the the crew members dont get settlements like the passengers
thats a workmans comp claim part of the union contract they do a dangerous job and they know it
youre the lawyer for the pilots union
no this is hugh lang the attorney we brought in to handle the criminal side of captain whitakers situation
yes and what is mr
ntsb is up my ass with a flashlight
we had to give them access to everything
shakes his head and everyone is curious about captain whitaker
through a glass wall we see
i flew with him
hes a great pilot
is he a drunk
hes a heavy drinker
should i bring him in
everyone steals glances at whip as carr continues to dominate
in a minute
alright so lets get down to it lenny
what does the union plan to do about this blood test that says whitaker was high on booze and coke
this guys a real peach
im gonna kill the toxicology report
feels eyes of disbelief it was done incompetently
the last time the toxicology equipment they used was calibrated was in june of which is months past code
their log that should clearly state who labeled the blood vials and when is very incomplete
and they arent sure who stored them
they used a preservative in the vials that has in some cases caused blood to ferment and register higher in an alcohol test
thats what ive done so far
i can handle this
i like this guy lenny
he makes me wanna go out and sniff a few lines and fly a jet
carr were gonna fight to push all the fault on jackson ridgefield the manufacturer
oh and you think theyre gonna just open their check book and buy us all lunch
good fucking luck
whats my exposure jim
the awards to the families could kill the airline
fuck the airline
the insurance companies can have the goddamm airline
i just dont want them to come sniffing in my other pockets
speaking for the pilots union
we dont want your airline to go away
we enjoy your contract with us and we will protect captain whitaker and in turn protect your airline
thats sweet mr
caldwell but if the ntsb leaks that toxicology report showing my pilot was flying that plane drunk
were all fucked
so far weve been lucky
are you that goddammed dumb
you think theyre waiting for a light news day to splash the headline drunk coke addled pilot crashes a plane
everyone goes quiet as carrs anger commands silence
my brothers in dc on his knees at the foot of the throne begging for forgiveness
and so far its working
theyve got their boot on the neck of this girl ellen block runnin the show for the ntsb and she is pissed
can you handle that
hugh cant stifle a laugh
they look to him
trust me im gonna kill the toxicology report
thats my job
carr looks to his lawyer who nods
i wish you luck but were still sorting out the best way to go forward legally
we might split from you and go it alone
carr stands to signal the end of the meeting
hugh stands to stop him
to go it alone
that would be what the french call a big fucking mistake
does whitaker know hes going to jail
i havent had a client go to jail yet
hes going to jail
he belongs in jail
you bet your ass hes going to jail the question is
is he gonna die in jail
youre wrong mr
last time i checked counts of manslaughter is life in prison
life in prison what we in georgia call all day long
it goes quiet as everyone reflects on that reality
whip stands up as the meeting spills into the waiting room
handshakes are exchanged as carr walks to whip and offers his hand to shake
they tell me youre some kind of pilot
carr nods sizing whip up
whip returns the nod as hugh quickly puts a hand on whips back and leads him away like a heavyweight being returned to his corner after pre fight instructions
we are now in whips living room watching home movies
you cant get up
whip is laughing
cmon knuckles whitaker drags himself up and goes long
we watch an year old will whitaker run long as the ball flies to him
he catches it and on screen whip hollers
come back and do it again
junior you dont know tired
im not going out
you go out
we pull away from the screen to find whip who sits on the couch
a large bottle of vodka appears empty amidst many dead beers and an ashtray that overflows
whip moves in drunken slow motion as he attempts to free a cigarette from the pack and light it
he freezes at one point and places his hands straight out in front of himself a strange involuntary drunken reset
his stare is a miles offshore he is anywhere but on this planet
the light from the headlights of a car in the driveway wash across the walls of the living room
we hear a car door open and women exchange good byes
keep coming back nicole
one day at a time
i know one day at a time
a we hear them laugh as whip still stares in to space
a the door pushes open and nicole comes in with the big book of aa in her hand
sorry im a little late but we went for coffee after the meeting
whip doesnt look whip
nicole goes close to see whip look at her with a non focused stare
she sees the table and reads the situation
nicole watches as whip stands up
in his oblivion he tries to focus
dont dont dont
ill get him
im not calling again
he didnt call
not calling back
nicole backs away as she watches the blacked out ballet play itself out in slow tragic fashion
whip motions to his lips as if he is smoking
he freezes and then steps forward and trips in to the coffee table
whip falls to the ground
nicole checks whips face to see his eyes partially opened but passed out
nicole goes to the bedroom and returns with a blanket that she covers whip with
she also places a pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled to the side so he doesnt choke
nicole looks around the room
she begins to collect the bottles and straighten up
close on whips face as he struggles with a thick hangover
he rubs his face and smacks his lips hes dry as a bone
whip shakes his head as he tries to focus his look through the bedroom window
he looks out to see nicole sitting on a chair enjoying the landscape
whip rubs his head before walking to the kitchen
whip pulls open the door to the fridge and pulls out a gallon of water in a plastic jug
whip stands and takes a long pull of the cold water
nicole sits with her camera staring at a candle on the table in front of her
an aa book rests on the table
she snaps a picture of the flame and then focuses out to the grassy landing strip and the rolling hills
whip enters carrying the large plastic bottle of water from the kitchen
whip coughs and rubs his eyes
are you okay
you were in bad shape when i got home
guess i drank a bit
you wanna count the fuckin beers
theyre still in the garbage
vodka too is that okay with you
its more than okay whip
its quiet as they let the awkward exchange pass
ive been watching the sky change as the sun rises
holds up the camera perfect light i went out and took some great shots
whip reaches for the camera
she hands it to him
lemme see that camera
my mom got it for me
towards the end when she knew she wasnt gonna recover
she maxed out her credit card to buy me that camera and a lighting kit
nicole takes a moment to tamp down some emotions
its just so beautiful here
did you grow up here
whip still holds the camera as he sits down
it was my grandfathers farm my dad grew up here
he was a pilot in world war ii flew with the nd
see the landing strip out there
he built that
he ran a crop duster outta here until the epa put an end to that
she nods listening he traded the crop duster for a used cessna
he flew that damn thing all over
its still in the barn
i was gonna sell this place after my dad died
then i got divorced
and your mom
your dad still alive
im pretty sure my father lives in colorado
you got no relationship with him
it was my mom that raised me
she was incredible
nicole lights a cigarette as the memories are tough
she held it together for so long i couldnt tell how sick she was
even through chemo she looked beautiful
nicole leans over and blows out the candle
they gave her very heavy meds for pain
dilauded morphine oxycontin
i started taking them with her
we would get all medicated and sit in our back yard and talk and talk and watch the sun go down
wed be so stoned that we couldnt get up to go inside when it got dark
laughs fights the pain i know it sounds crazy to get hooked on dope with your mom but she was dying and we spent her last seven months together like
teenagers trading stories about boys and whatever
she loved me
whip lifts the camera and points it at nicole
she contorts her face into a sly smile
whip snaps it
the blue sky is the perfect backdrop as we reveal
whip in a dark suit walks amidst mourners who file out of the church
the center of attention is a large distraught woman in her s being consoled by what appears to be her son and his wife
the woman wears a pin that holds a photo of trina
whip stands at the bottom of the steps watching folks looking for someone
suddenly a year old boy stands in front of him
the boy locks eyes with him
you saved my mom
whip looks up to see margaret thomason walking towards him
she has her left arm in a sling underneath her jacket
we can see a bandage along her hairline
whip smiles obviously uncomfortable
margaret hugs him
its great to see you whip
you too margaret
broken collar bone
yeah and some stitches but im fine
i really am
she goes quiet it was a nice service
i mean look at all these people that wanted to say goodbye
she looked beautiful in there
whip is blank didnt you think so whip
like she was gonna wake up and smile
i didnt go in
margaret is sensing whips struggle
trevor find dad
hes by mr
are you okay
you should come to the counseling group
the union has great people for us to talk to
i cant really
i will but just not now
margaret smiles and leans in and kisses whip on the cheek
take care whip okay
she starts to leave
whip stops her with
im in the middle of this investigation
the ntsb is investigating the crash i know
im going in to see them next week
im nervous because i was out the night before the crash at dinner with trina
yeah and i had two glasses of wine
and they might ask you about my condition that morning and if you thought i had anything to drink
margaret appears speechless
ive known you years and youre gonna stand here and tell me you and trina went to dinner and you drank two glasses of wine
sounds like a nice restaurant whip which one was it
you have to tell them it was an ordinary day
i mean it was an ordinary day
you know i was in shape to fly
you have a problem with saying that
its a lie
whip its a lie
trina told me you two hadnt been to sleep
my lack of sleep made the plane fall apart huh margaret
im just trying to get it straight
you think that another pilot would have been able to land that plane and save more lives
i didnt say that whip
i cant imagine another pilot doing
well can you imagine trevor at this same church looking at you in that box in there
or my son having to come and see me in prison
margaret fights tears as whip has struck a blow
please whip enough
dont you think weve all had enough
whip is quiet what do you want me to say
it was an ordinary day
the storm right after we took off was very severe but as far as the flight crew was concerned it was a perfectly ordinary day
the tears flow now as margaret cant hold them in
whip realizes hes gone too far
not knowing what to do whip walks away
whip watches an airliner fly over head as he stands by his car smoking a cigarette
he wears his suit from the funeral
shes in a great mood
are you okay
how was it
it was okay okay
howre you doin
well i got through my first day
they havent fired me
cause for a celebration
they needed someone to work the night shift
they asked me and its time and a half so
she sorts through her shoulder bag
i gotta vest and heres my name tag
oh oh oh
i got you something
hands him a nice lighter its a p mustang on there
flies her arms like youre dad flew a p right
stares at the lighter he did
so should we get some dinner
i promised sheila i would be at the meeting tonight
shes the one thats been helping me my sponsor
can we do it tomorrow night
and please whip dont make me choose between dinner with you and the meeting
whip nods playing with the lighter
no its okay
you should go
why dont you come with me
well eat after
its an open meeting
that means anybody can come
she is bubbling with happy spirit shes hot
shes hard to deny as whip cant help but smile at her
a man stands at a podium wearing a coat and tie
he is lost in the energized retell of a story
the cop is shining his flashlight on me
im standing there behind the dumpster wearing nothing but my girlfriends panties vomit on my chest and i say to the cop
about two beers
the room erupts with laughter
nicole is really taken by the candor of the speaker as she joins the room in laughter
thats why they call me two beer barry
barry makes eye contact with a stern looking old timer
barry holds up a loose leaf binder and addresses the man
dont worry ed i got the format right here
im sorry eds giving me the stink eye
let me get back to the format
reads from the format im barry
im an alcoholic
are there any other alcoholics present
whip glances around to find himself in a sea of raised handed alcoholics
a few look at whip with no judgement
i like meetings that have us all identify
because it makes me tell the truth about who i am
it reminds that i never ever told the truth
i lied about everything
my whole life had been a lie
and i was told that i would never get sober if i kept lying
whip is very reserved poker faced
i mean lyings what im good at
if i know anything in this life its how to lie especially about my drinking
we pan the faces and everyone seems immediately connected
except whip who leans over to nicole
i gotta go
points to sheila yeah sheila
she can take me back to work
extends her hand im sheila
whip shakes her hand before quickly escaping as if from a fire
we stay close on whips face as he walks out
barry continues his pitch
like i said i would lie about everything
it didnt matter what it was
my whole life had been a lie
a series of lies strung together by me
and when i drank
it was worse
what i came to understand was that my lies were killing me
and that remains the great fact for me
my lies will kill me
whip is gone
whip enters the bar and we hear off camera a voice coming from the tv above the bar
the ntsb is focusing their investigation on the flight crew specifically captain whitaker
sir i am not at liberty to discuss captain whitaker or any of the flight crew
whip looks up to the tv
and in truth i dont have much to say about him
on a split screen so safe to say that he remains a mystery
sir those are your words not mine
whip exits as fast as he arrived
piers morgan continues from the tv
ive been speaking to some people who are very close to the ntsb investigation and they are very confident that they will be able to determine exactly what brought this
im sure they will sir
thank you ken and vicki evans
thank you and god bless
whip steps off an elevator and walks down the quiet hospital hallway toward a room where a few technicians are packing up the last bits of tv equipment
whip stands in the doorway and addresses evans
howre you feeling ken
evans stares at whip with a blank look
happy to be alive
blessed to be alive
im captain whitaker i was flying i know who you are
whip senses an unwelcome undercurrent
he locks eyes with evans trying to read him
silence before evans speaks to the maam can you give us some privacy
come on in sir
shut the door
the attending nurse files out placing a chair next to the bed as she leaves
its again quiet
listen how long have you been
outta the coma
i didnt mean to disrupt your whole day
i know they been swamping you with interviews
you were great on evans smiles at whip
both my legs were crushed and my pelvis snapped
ill probably never walk again least not without a walker or braces
ill certainly never fly again
im sorry ken
that plane was doomed the second you sat in the chair
you reeked like gin or somethin
i called vicki from the plane before we took off
thats when the rain kicked up
vicki nods holding her cross with the chain across her lips
i dont know how much you remember but the plane started to fall apart
i remember everything until we crashed
i know what went on
what are we talking about
i dont know captain whitaker what are we talking about
i just wanted to get a sense from you what you thought caused the crash
was it the fact that you got on the plane drunk from the night before
whip goes white and drops his head
the ntsb is coming back tomorrow to finish taking a deposition from me about the events on the flight
you think youd be alive without me on that plane
no wed all be dead
but are you gonna argue that your physical state was tip top
im not gonna argue anything with you
whip gets up
sit please sit
i never shared my opinion about your physical state the morning of the flight
ive never said word
whip sits and studies evans
the flight was pre ordained
ive prayed on it captain
vicki and i have prayed on it
theres only one judge praise jesus
and he has a higher plan for you sir
this event although tragic in its loss of life is also a celebration of life
evans begins to mist up with sincere inspiration
nothing happens in the kingdom of the lord by mistake
captain will you pray with me
whip stares into evans eyes and sees a believers conviction
evans reaches out his hand to whip
whip slowly moves out of his chair and kneels at the side of evans bed
whip takes evans hand and bows his head as he reaches for vickis at the same time
its quiet before
jesus our lord and savior we thank you for blessing captain whitaker with courage and wisdom
for guiding his hand on that fateful morning
in his divine light we were saved
it is quiet for an extended beat
whip looks at evans and his wife whose heads are bowed with reverence
a small pickup truck rambles to a stop in the driveway
we hear music and laughter as nicole gets out
thanks for the ride guys
ill see you tomorrow
keep it up nicole you could be employee of the year
they all laugh nicole waves as they drive off
she walks towards the house which is dark
she hears music and looks towards the barn to see bright light escaping through the sagging doors and split wood walls
nicole slowly approaches the almost glowing barn door
her curiosity compels her to pull it open
the door swings open to find the plane pointed towards the driveway with an aged patina but revitalized shine
lenny kravitz fly away blares from the stereo
whip emerges from the cockpit
hes still in his suit but with his jacket off and sleeves rolled up
hes energized like an excited kid
he runs up and kisses her
nicole notes the cloud of smoke hanging in the air and the burning cigarette in the ashtray empty beers
looks great right

nicole takes in this cool trinket of aviation history

i learned to fly in this plane

whip laughs remembering
my friend harling and i flew it to jamaica

we ended up in bethel jamaica
it was like a picture on a post card
the white sand and sky blue water

nicole walks away leaving whip with his plane and his dream of freedom
whip calls after her
i choose to drink
you choose it
i dont see a lot of choice goin on
i choose to drink
and i blame it on me
im happy to
ive got an ex wife and a son i dont see
because i choose to drink
we follow whip as he enters the house and approaches the doorway of the bedroom
whip sees nicole sitting on the bed
she quickly tucks her cell phone away as whip holds up his hand to signal a truce
alright look i was loaded when i crashed that plane
with this investigation going on i dont know whats gonna happen

i promise if you dont like it or if i dont clean up

this is the most sincere plea shes ever heard
its so beautiful there
well leave before noon
im a great pilot
youll get to see so much
whip wraps his arms around her
we stay on nicoles face as he holds her tighter and tighter
nicole is dressed and sitting at the kitchen table
past nicole we can see whip lying in bed
she has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at her feet
she finishes a handwritten note and places it down
nicole picks up the note and begins to reread it
she hears a car in the driveway she picks up her stuff and takes one last look at the sleeping whip
she leaves careful not to make a sound
nicole quietly exits the house carrying a crate of her stuff
she has a duffel bag of clothes over her shoulder as she makes her way to sheilas car that we see parked at the top of the driveway far from
whip stirs wakes up and looks around
whip walks around looking for nicole
he finds the note and reads it
the reality of her disappearance sets in and he moves to the window and stares out at the barn
whip returns his look inside the house and he sees the big book of aa on the table near where the letter was left
whip picks it up and throws it across the room
he then grabs the back of a chair and tosses it against the wall
after wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty beer bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall
the bottle explodes and whip stops as he realizes he came within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his son
we hear the antiquated ring of the old house phone
whip relaxes his shoulders as the ringing phone distracts him
whip is now drawing heavy breaths as the ringing phone is answered by the old machine
youve reached the whitaker crop dusting company flying lessons and plane rides
please leave a message and it will be returned
the beep concludes
speaking to voice mail hey whip if youre there pickup
i got some good news
whip snatches the phone of the hook
yeah im here
whats goin on
whip listens as charlie talks
whip sits in his car
rain pounds the windshield as we watch him expertly add vodka to a half full bottle of orange juice
whip gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink
whip takes another drink before re capping the bottle and stowing it in the glove box
whip gets out and we watch him walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar
a security guard meets him and takes him inside
whip is now alone in the huge brightly lit hangar
he sees the plane
the jr has all of its pieces laying as close together as possible
like the skeleton of a t rex in a museum
the sight is awesome breathtaking
whip walks closer to the twisted wreck and stops
whip is overwhelmed by the sight and as he is about to leave
charlie steps out of the passenger door and calls down to heres our guy
whip walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the plane where the door used to be
charlie stands at the top of the ramp
suddenly hugh steps out of the plane
captain whitaker weve won
whip doesnt move as hugh starts down the ramp
this is what we call in my profession a walk over
theyve scheduled the hearing
its in days
charlie and hugh reach the bottom of the ramp
but these hearings can be tough
you just need to stay sharp and on course and answer the questions correctly
its no longer a question of your condition but the condition of the plane
this picks directly at the scab of whips guilt
ive had an act of god successfully added to the list of probable causes
look its simple
i flew a broken plane
you got it
and what about my toxicology report
trying to stay calm i killed it
they have no physical proof that you were intoxicated on that plane
and no eye witness claims
but theres a problem
this stops whip cold
because of the turbulence at the beginning of the flight and then the crash there was never any drink service on the flight
but they found two little vodka bottles in the galley trash bin
there was no physical evidence found on the bottles no dna no finger prints
but both the bottles were uncapped and empty
the only people who had access to those bottles and could have drank them were the flight crew
margaret evans and camelia satou all had clean tox reports
that leaves you and trina marquez
they let that land
where this is going
thats funny that they found two bottles
because i drank three
hugh explodes in frustration
when i met you i couldnt believe what a flip drunk arrogant scumbag you were
fuck you too hugh
but i did the research and heard the analysis from the experts
im in awe of what you did
can i go now
hugh gets big as he has to add the final piece of credence to the coronation
hugh is so loud and emotional even whip lends focus
do you know how many were able to safely land these broken planes
everyone waits for the response as hugh acknowledges the debris around them
every pilot crashed and killed everyone on board
you have no capacity to accept the responsibility for the miracle you performed and the lives you saved
im going home
whip pulls out his cigarettes and frees a smoke from the pack
do you want to go to prison
im trying to save your life
charlie steps between them as this exchange spirals
what fucking life
dont kill yourself on my account hugh
whip starts to walk away
okay im done here
im running out a faith that this guys gonna make it charlie
turns on hugh you wanna talk about me like im not here
like im fucking dead
to whip now this ntsb hearing is a federal agency hearing
do you understand that
its in days and if i show up with you like this
whip turns and walks
hugh wheels on charlie and lights him up
everything weve done
everything ive done
goes out the window
thats not on me
i did my job
its your job charlie to get him straight and get him to the church on time
yeah charlie just get him home
sober him up long enough to save the unions contract and that fat fucks airline
i shoulda died on that plane
whip walks away from them away from the bright clean shiny floor of the hangar and into the growing rain storm
the rain has subsided as whip pulls up to his driveway
whip turns into the driveway and spots a news van in front of his house
he makes a u turn and speeds away
the rain has completely stopped but everything remains wet as whip bangs his front tire in to the curb as he attempts to park in front of a well maintained
whip checks the mirrors before taking a long drink from a large orange juice bottle
whip gets out of his car and makes his way across the street and towards the house
the driver of a black prius that has been parked farther down the street gets out of his car talking on a cell phone
whip walks up the steps and knocks on the door
he waits a beat and knocks again
finally it opens deana an attractive well dressed woman in her s stands there staring
what are you doing here
its lovely to see you too deana
may i come in
deana takes a moment before stepping aside to allow whip in
whip glides into the kitchen of this fastidiously kept home
thought i d come see you and will
calls out loudly its very quiet we havent talked at all since this whole thing happened and i just thought we should talk
you know that i prefer that you call us
like anyone in this house has called me in the last three years to say anything other than wheres the money
have you been drinking
well that took
fake checks his watch it took seconds for you im gonna ask you to step outside of the house please
has continued to rant ladies and gentlemen it took coleman to ask me if i have been drinking
a new world record
im calling the police
youre asking me to leave the house i bought for you
im telling you to leave
whip turns to see his year old son will standing at the foot of the stairs near the door
william whitaker junior
the man of the house
nice of you to call me back
im telling you to leave
are you the man of the house
you upset my mother
you gotta go
im your father tough guy
youre a drunk
now get the fuck out
you dont know who the fuck i am
pulling open the door i sure dont
what did you say
i said i sure dont
why dont you tell me
who the fuck are you
who are you
who are deana now steps between them and pushes will towards the stairs as she puts her hand on the doorknob
im outta here
im outta here
i know where im not wanted
whip turns quietly
he opens the door and walks outside to find
whip is completely caught off guard
they step right onto the tiny landing with him
through the fracas we hear a variety of questions lobbed at how come you wont talk to the press
a lot of people are going out of their way to keep you out of the media are you hiding something
we hear the squelch of a police siren as a cop car lands on the scene
do you still live here captain whitaker
how well did you know katerina marquez the flight attendant that died
a reporter trips down the stairs
whip grabs one of these news rats and just before pounding him he breaks in to a relaxed smile
folks please give us some room
gets down the stairs at the appropriate time i will tell my story
now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured
i appreciate your interest in me but i ask that you leave my family in peace
the gallery quiets to listen and record his words
whip again is incredibly smooth and intuitive while drunk and under pressure
we can hear the squawking of police sirens approaching
whip starts to head down the porch and the frenzy erupts again
the police begin to disperse the news rats
whip pulls an officer aside
im captain whitaker i was yes sir i know who you are
can you get me to my car
anything you need sir
whip walks with the young cop who shields him from the fray
we can see the young cop standing in front of the driver side door shielding whip from the press who stay away
whip exhales trying to slow his racing heart and head
hes drunk but controlled
he looks at his hands
they are shaking
we see whip on the tv repeating the speech he gave reporters on deanas front lawn
now is a time for grieving and taking care of those injured
i appreciate your interest in me but i ask that you leave my family in peace
a reporter now wraps up the piece
a reasonable request from a quiet heroic man whos been through so much
this is tilda banden reporting from devonwood
now a desk anchor changes stories
in a related story tonight at cale rawson talks with aviation experts to see if the tragedy of flight could have been avoided
we boom down to find whip who looks drained as he sits on charlies couch in the fastidiously neat office
whip holds an unlit smoke
the wooden pocket doors slide open and charlies wife gestures towards whip
whip stands as charlie enters
amanda was so nice to let me in
i couldnt find a safe place
amanda slides the door shut as charlie throws his bag and his coat down with gusto
he reaches up and pushes a button on the tv and it goes off
what the hell is wrong with you
i spoke to hugh he told me that you went to your ex wifes house
drunk as a skunk and the news crews showed up
whip just stares and the police escorted you out
i think its okay
ive been watching and i think its okay
hugh checked every media outlet that covered it and it looks like were good
you come off fine
listen charlie heres the deal no whip
look at you
i have no idea what youre gonna do or say ever
youre all over the place
i was the one guy in your court
i was your apologist your defender
but not anymore
i can do this
youre about to be questioned by a federal agency about piloting an airliner drunk
an airliner that crashed
and you continue to drink and stumble around
what kind of crazy do you have to be to do that
im scared of you
lets just stick to the plan
you cant stick to anything
this whole thing has just been so heavy its killing me
tell hugh i can do it
look i really wanna fly again get back to my life and be done with all this shit
this hearing is days away
hugh busted his ass to try to get you excused but theres no way
you have to appear
let me stay here
they have my houses all staked out now
let me stay here until the hearing charlie
i wont leave the house
charlie takes a long look at his old troubled friend
you cant drink here whip
you cant drink in my house
can you do that
i wont drink
charlie nods hoping that whip can deliver on that promise
we watch a can of coca cola swing in whips hand
we pull out to find whip walking with charlie down a hallway of the st
time has passed as whip looks the best weve ever seen him look
he is well rested well dressed and carrying a suit in a wardrobe bag
as we approach the open door to a guest room hugh pops out
a plain clothes security guard follows hugh out of the room and stands behind him
you look great whip
i mean that
i feel really good
i heard you havent had a drink in days
checks his watch two hours and minutes
but whos counting
charlie addresses the security guard
whip officer edmonds will be staying here tonight
any problems hell handle it
hugh stands by the open door and gestures charlie and whip inside
hugh walks in to the center of the room and turns to whip
well whip we just wanted to make this as easy for you as possible
whip puts his wardrobe bag down on the bed
just get a good nights rest
relax order up a steak get a movie
whip is checking his phone
hugh gestures to charlie for him to leave so they can be alone
okay cowboy im out
the hearing starts at so we should plan on for breakfast here in the room
wait charlie thanks for letting me stay with you
i needed it
you did great cowboy
youve got a beautiful family
im very blessed
charlie leaves and hugh joins whip at the window
hugh hands whip a thick folder
i made you a copy of my entire file on you and the investigation
i also tried to anticipate what you might be asked under oath and i wrote out some non damaging responses
its all in there photos testimony interviews
i called ellen block let her know that youre here and all tucked in
so does she have the knife out for me
remember shes limited in what she can ask you
youre not on trial but you are under oath
shes probably not happy that i killed the tox report but youll be fine
whip laughs a little
ill see you in the morning
the two respectfully nod
hugh leaves and the door shuts behind him
whip puts the folder on the table and steps to the mini bar
he bends down and opens the fridge
whip sees the fridge is overly stocked with soda and juices
every soft drink you can imagine
no booze anywhere
whip chuckles about the alcohol removal as he grabs a coke
whip unbuttons his shirt and pulls it out of his waist line
whip sits on the edge of the bed eating a room service steak
the file folder sits on the table
now in his undershirt and shorts whip lies propped up on the bed watching television
the file folder now rests on the bed
whip is meticulously shaving
he stares a long while at the disposable razor as the water runs over its blade
after a moment he goes back to shaving
whip sits at the small table looking through the file
he leafs through photos with no recognizable emotion
he looks to the clock radio
we hear the shower running and steam fogs the mirrors
whip wears boxers and a tee shirt with a towel around his neck
he looks to the clock whip lays the suit out neatly on the couch separating the shirt which he hangs from a light fixture to relax any creases
the room is dark
a soft wind rattles the window sash
whip lies on the bed
he sighs sleep is alluding him and the anxiety of tomorrows events on no sleep has his head spinning
he hears a metallic click
he stays quiet to listen for it
there it is again
an annoying click
the clock reads he sits up and switches on the light
he rubs his eyes and goes to the table and sees the file folder laying there
as he is about to pick it up he hears the metallic click again
he goes to investigate
the connecting door is unlocked
whip arrives and waits
he now watches as the connecting lock bolt clicks against the frame the door swinging in a draft
he looks up to see the culprit a heating vent
whip flips the vent closed
whip now pushes the door with his finger opening it a few inches
the room is vacant
the bed is made
the drapes are pulled open
whip walks quietly on the carpet towards the window
the night is clear
whip takes in the city lights
among the glass and steel office buildings whip spots a church spire
a simple cross is perched on top
whip looks at the church deep in thought
we hear a hum
the gentle hum of an electric motor
whip turns from the window and scans the room
its the mini bar refrigerator humming to life
whip stares at the gleaming black box
the whir of the motor seems to get louder
whip looks at the fridge
his face is blank his eyes tell us nothing
whip steps toward the box
close on the mini bar
whip swings open the door
colors sparkle as a cadre of tiny liquor bottles glow like jewels in a chest
whip stares at the glimmering gems for a long long time vodka gin wine bourbon
the bottles shimmer amber whip reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle he gently pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the fridge
he holds up the mini vodka and considers it
now whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the white whiskey
he looks at the bottle once more then slowly twists the tiny cap back on
with a look of solemn resignation whip places the frosted mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away
we stay close on the bottle
the camera focuses on the small bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side ever so slowly slowly
in a flash whip scoops the vodka out of frame
the elevator doors open and hugh and charlie step out and head down the hallway
we follow our guys as they approach whips room finding officer edmonds exactly where we left him in front of whips door
officer edmonds stands up as charlie and hugh approach carrying coffees
good morning hows our man
not a peep
charlie knocks on the door and checks his watch as he waits for whip to answer
charlie cocks his head knocks again
i think your pilot overslept
you didnt let any girls in there last night did you
no sir not a soul
no one came in or out
they all wait awkwardly as hugh checks his watch and knocks on the door
i have a room key
charlie takes the room key and lets himself in
charlie carefully enters whips room
he is spooked by the silence
hugh joins him as they take in the room
the bed looks slept in and the room service dinner tray rests politely on the dining table but whip is nowhere to be found
did he disappear
charlie tentatively walks around the empty room the bathroom the closet until he finally sees the adjoining room door
he turns to hugh with a surprised look
charlie knocks on the slightly opened adjoining door
no response so charlie lightly tosses the door open
charlie looks in to find the scene of the crime
smoke still hangs in the air and empty bottles and cans cover every surface in the room
hugh joins him
where is he
charlie closes his eyes and says a silent prayer as he heads for the bathroom
charlie is stopped by the sight of whips lifeless body wedged between the tub and the toilet
charlie turns whip over to see his non responsive face
hugh arrives and freaks out
is he dead
charlie shows immediate relief that whip is breathing
officer edmonds has joined them
should i get an ambulance
just wait charlie
lets think about this
the two stare at each other and realize they are both breathing heavily from the shock and stress of their predicament
get him to the bed
to the officer
can you wait outside and dont let anyone in here
charlie and hugh drag whip out of the bathroom and flop him on the bed
son of a bitch
you worthless motherfucker what a waste
i cleared the decks for you
you piece of shit
you just fucked it all up like the piss drunk you are
hugh grabs at whips collar and whip actually sits up and reaches for hugh a nice sign of life from whip
charlie pulls hugh away from whip who falls back on the bed
what time is it
the hearing is in minutes
how much grace do you think we got
how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me shut the fuck up you drunk
i once was lost and now im found was blind but
well im still kinda blind
we probably have an hour before we really need to get him to the hearing and its just downstairs
we need a wheel chair
call harling mays
harlings got a wheel chair
harlings got cocaine
hugh and charlie exchange a desperate look
this is fucking insane
were in so just
tell him i need bananas
charlie prays for a voice on the other end
harling this is charlie
im a friend of whips
we need you to do a very early very discreet
whip needs bananas and you need to bring them to the st
jerome hotel downtown
how many bunches of bananas
whip holds up fingers is the answer im getting you will be well compensated
the the st
jerome hotel room
charlie hangs up and looks at whip who is mostly passed out again
charlie looks to hugh
the elevator opens and we see harling step from the elevator with his knapsack over his shoulder
teva sandals sunglasses
whip has a towel around his neck as he tries to sip coffee
charlie sits opposite him at the small table by the window
the door bursts open and harling storms in
come mista tally man tally me banana
whip whats the deal man you look like youre hurtin for certain
shut the door interior lock
harling places a leather doctors bag on the table
an anxious charlie reaches for the bag which sets harling into a frenzy
its quiet as harling gives orders
everyone except whip and myself take three steps away from the table
as they step away harling now pulls a beautiful silver framed mirror from his bag and a blue coke grinder he calmly but sternly delivers orders
i need three things
focuses on charlie two glasses of water a credit card and a hundred dollar bill
all i have is a twenty
takes the card and bill thatll do
and i need to make a coco puff
harling tosses a pack of smokes to charlie
hugh takes the smokes from charlie and pulls out a cigarette
harling stops grinding opens the lid and pours out a nice smooth pile of coke
he begins a masterful ballet of cocaine manipulation
millions of dollars hang in the balance
hugh is removing the last quarter of an inch of tobacco from the end of the cigarette
they hang on the consumption of a dollar bag of cocaine
harling uses the credit card to groom the coke into neat piles and lines
he has a system
whips head sags as he again appears ready to pass out
okay whip just two small whiffs first
one on each side
just a primer
using the mirror as a tray harling holds the rolled up dollar bill just above the line of coke
whip slowly manages to place his face in position to ingest the coke
its tense as his head wobbles
he finally zeroes in and snorts the first line
harling quickly switches nostrils
whip sniffs the other side
atta boy head back now
water chief you
charlie puts the glass of water to whips mouth
snaps his fingers coco puff
hugh hands harling the cigarette with a slightly hollowed out tip
harling leans over the coke with the cigarette in his mouth and hoovers up a small pile sucking the coke through the cigarette
harling sits up careful to keep the cocaine in the end of the cigarette
he tips it up and lights it
little coco puff buddy
cmon banana man
whos the banana man
whips head levels a look to harling with a smile that leads us to believe that he is actually making a rally
good man focus up big dog
heres the train comin to you
harling takes a puff and holds it as he extends the cocaine cigarette to whip
whip is more nimble now as he cocks his head in acceptance of the cigarette
whip takes a drag and holds it
still holding the smoke keep it down big dog banana boats comin tell me the banana boats comin
whip finally exhales the smoke harling does too
the banana boat is here
nothing can keep you down dog
nothing keeps the big dog down
okay we gotta go
harling has crafted big lines now he snorts one himself in record time
looks to hugh and charlie
you guys are up
no im good
are you fucking crazy
whip jumps in and sniffs huge lines
he looks to harling
thanks brother im back
harling gathers his things stands and hugs whip
i love you man
i love you too
hugh and charlie are quiet as they watch the strange but sincere drug fueled emotion pass between two old friends
harling eyes charlie before handing him a baggie
theres a gram in here you paid for it and he might need it
my work here is done
see you all on the dark side of the moon
harling leaves and our trio exchange looks did that just happen
the opening bars of joe cockers feelin alright crackle just before we see whip step out of the hotel room and begin a relatively steady strut down the hallway
sunglasses on whip is backed by hugh and charlie who flank him from a few steps behind
further back we can see that officer edwards also exits the room wearing latex gloves carrying a large plastic garbage bag that obviously holds any evidence of the debauched night
or the mornings resurrection
whip hugh and charlie ride the elevator
whip is buttoning his shirt and fixing his tie
it is miraculous how the coke has revived him
a mom and her year old daughter get on the elevator
we watch as a small trickle of blood escapes from whips left nostril
hugh pulls a handkerchief from his pocket hands it to whip
whip accepts the handkerchief and wipes his nose
whip sees blood on the cloth and tilts his head back
we now see that there is a mirrored ceiling to the elevator
whip tries to study his reflection in the ceiling as he holds the hankie to his nose
whip begins to wobble and charlie helps him regain his balance
our trio walk as tall as they can towards the hearing room
im gonna head in and tell ellen block that were here
hugh hustles off as charlie pulls close to whip
youre gonna make it
remember if they ask about your drinking its totally acceptable to say i dont recall
whip wheels on charlie and unloads with focused anger
do not tell me how to lie about my drinking
ive been lying about my drinking my whole life
as we disappear in to whips weary eyes we hear the distinctive sound of a jetliner screaming through the air
on two large screens we watch the grainy cell phone footage shot by a witness of southjet flight s final moments in the sky
accompanying the video is the real audio of the cockpit voice recording
the room has a dais where the ntsb board members sit
a large blue curtain is the backing for the round ntsb shield that hangs above the proceedings
a large drop down screen will show images graph and text as needed by the ntsb
a confident woman ellen block approaches carrying a file which she lays on the podium
those are difficult images to watch
for the record im ellen block hearing officer for this hearing
captain whitaker good morning
we see whip who looks rough but stable in his witness chair
what was captured on that video is that the aircraft was in a relatively stable glide just prior to the moment of impact
however according to the data we retrieved from the cockpit data recorders at exactly after flying minutes without incident the transponder recorded a loss in altitude in excess of feet
per minute in what is considered a full pitch nose down attitude
then at according to the data recorders a decision was made to invert the aircraft
the ntsb has created animated simulation that i would like to play at this point
ellen points to the screen
an ntsb animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the real audio of the flight crew
the animation has a split screen that also shows the instruments and printed text of whats being said
whats your sons name
the black box i love you trevor
be a good boy mommy loves you
what are we doing
why would i trim down
were gonna roll it
here we go
ive got control
that last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops and the lights come back up
we return to the hearing in progress
that audio is tragic and compelling
i chose to play that part of the cockpit recording to highlight a key moment aboard flight wherein you say were gonna roll it here we go ive got control
you made a very conscious decision to invert the airplane to roll the plane upside down
is that correct
im not sure it was conscious
it was more of an instinct
what led to that decision
whip is clearly struggling in his chair
the coke got him there but it may start to fail him soon
i dont recall
let me quote from an investigative summary
from until the events on the aircraft are
again i quote bold and remarkable
by inverting the plane captain whitaker arrested the descent and allowed the aircraft to level off enabling him to glide the aircraft away from any populated areas and allowing him
to execute a forced landing in an open field
we hear a smattering of applause as the facts of his actions are remarkable
i heard a metallic bang
we pitched nose down
whip looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still coursing through his exhausted frame
you had no idea what was wrong with the aircraft
there was a lot of things wrong with that aircraft
whip glances towards hugh and charlie who are poker faced
as i said before you can add any details you like to any comments i make
do you remember any thing else that was out of the ordinary
did you feel the flight crew was in their best shape
whip takes a minute to digest this question
it was raining very hard the morning you took off wasnt it
there was some convective activity in the area
however my first officer and i discussed the conditions on the field and determined that we were safely within our visibility and crosswind minimums
yes first officer evans testimony confirms the same
whip goes quiet as ellen block looks at him over her glasses seeing if he has any reaction
i want to show you something
hugh is frozen in a steely gaze charlie seems to hold his breath
ellen points her remote at the projector but it doesnt work
this remote is not working
i can do it manually
she shrugs and heads down onto the stage closer to whip where she can advance the slides by touching the projector
we now see a screen where a slide is showing a long metal screw the size of a trombone
this is the jackscrew on the tail assembly which articulates the horizontal stabilizer also known as the elevator
as you can see the threads on this screw are almost entirely gone
substandard thread life is how we reported it
this part was suggested as a maintenance replacement in january of
it was never replaced
this had additional hours of flight on it
it finally failed
we watch the elevator acting as a wing on the tail that goes up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend
our investigators have concluded that the jackscrew snapped and the elevator was frozen in a fixed position locking the elevator in a down position which forced the plane into a
the loss of the elevator was and i quote our report a catastrophic event from which recovery was improbable and stable flight impossible
everyone goes quiet as those words resonate
ellens tone changes as she understands how hard this is for some people to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last living minutes on this earth
in sheer terror
it is deathly quiet in the ballroom
even the press are silent
again i quote
from until the piloting decisions made by captain whitaker were bold and remarkable
the fact that captain whitaker commanded that the aircraft stay inverted while descending to an extremely low altitude shows a miraculous intuition that in this instance saved lives
a genuine applause spreads from the hearing room
ellen block allows this moment to happen
whip is fading dazed and uncomfortable with the unexpected adulation
he stands up
i appreciate that
the room gets quiet as whips demeanor seems terse
whip stares at ellen white with sweat and chemicals
we see hugh grind his jaw as this line of questioning has him on tilt
whitaker i want to talk about the days leading and hours leading up to the accident
but before i do i want to remind you that you are under oath and any testimony that you give here today will be considered admissable in any subsequent hearings
or criminal proceedings do you understand what that means
captain whitaker for the record i need you to verbalize your answer
yes i understand
on the three days leading up to the day of the accident tuesday october th wednesday october th or thursday october th of did you consume any alcohol or other
whip takes his time
i did not
sit stone faced in the second row feeling the relief of months of hard work
ellen block continues with a rote posture
on the morning of the accident friday october th did you consume any alcohol or ingest any chemicals or drugs that may have impaired your ability to perform your job
i did not
ellen wraps up this line of questions
whitaker do you now or have you ever had a problem with alcohol dependency alcoholism or drug addiction
whip waits for her to look at him
this takes a while
hugh maintains a poker face charlie appears relieved
ellen sorts through her notes one last time
whitaker were about done
she refers to her notes due to the severe turbulence during the early part of the flight you asked the flight crew to suspend the beverage service on the plane
is that correct
i suspended the drink service
are you aware that our investigators found two single service vodka bottles in the galley trash bin
slides now show the two small vodka bottles in evidence
there were crew members on board the flight who would have had access to the beverage trolley
less than an hour after the accident blood was taken from each of the crew members
a southjet corporate photo of whip pops on to the large monitors
after ellen references a member of the flight crew their photo pops on to the monitors
first officer evans flight attendant margaret thomason and posthumously from camelia satou and katerina marquez
katerina marquez photo does not pop up on the screen
a toxicology analysis was performed and three of these tests came back negative one was disqualified for technical reasons
hugh smiles satisfied
and one tested positive for alcohol
it registered a
blood alcohol level
are you aware of that
i am now
miss marquez was not only a colleague but you knew her outside of work
outside of work
did you know miss marquez had a drinking problem
i did not
did you ever see her drink to excess
i did not
did you know that she was twice treated for alcohol addiction
the last time was months ago and paid for by southjet airlines
i did not
a picture of trinas beautiful smiling face flashes up on the is it your opinion that katerina marquez drank the vodka on the plane
whip smiles at the photo of trina as if she can see him
he then shakes his head to snap from the memory of her great spirit
he gets serious as he bears his look down on ellen
can you repeat the question
your opinion captain
is it your opinion that katerina marquez drank on that flight
he runs his trembling hand through his hair
since her toxicology report is the only toxicology report that is admissable in this hearing and she in fact tested positive for alcohol is it your opinion that katerina marquez
drank those bottles of vodka on the flight
whip drops his head and mutters something inaudible
im sorry mr
whitaker i couldnt hear you
what did you say
god help me
a confused mumble rises in the room
whips response flusters ellen for a moment but she recovers quickly
however is it your opinion
whip cuts her off
lowers his voice its my opinion
trina did not
drink the vodka
excuse me mr
softly to himself she saved that boys life
captain whitaker can you speak whip stops
his whole body trembles his face tightens
he looks right at ellen
because i did
i drank the vodka
the crowd gasps unsure of what they just heard
charlie rockets out of his chair
please be seated sir
this is not a court room
now charlie returns to his chair to find that hugh is gone
charlie looks around for hugh no sign
whip leans close to the microphone
i drank the vodka bottles on the plane
whitaker in light of that remark would you like to readdress
you dont have to readdress anything
i drank the vodka
on the three nights before the accident october th on october th th and th and th i was intoxicated
i drank alcohol on all of those days
i drank to excess
chaos erupts further as reporters outnumber security
flash bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the fracas on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee
whitaker on the morning of i was drunk
im drunk right now miss block
im drunk right
whip finally breaks down im drunk now because
because im an alcoholic
we have pushed into a tight shot on whips face as the sound in the room fades away
we stay tight on whips face as he lets the moments unfold
suddenly the noise cuts to silence
whip is looking at the assembly
whip wipes tears from his eyes
we hear whips voice as the dialogue pre laps the image of his face
that was it
i was done
its as if id hit my life long limit for lies
a new angle shows whip speaking these words
i could not tell one more lie
and maybe im a sucker
because if i had just told one more lie
i could have walked away from that whole mess and kept my wings and my false sense of pride and most importantly i would have avoided being locked up here
with all of you nice folks for the last months
we hear laughter as we pull out from whip to realize that he is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an aa meeting in a federal prison
it looks like i will serve every day of the remaining plus years of my sentence
and thats fair
i betrayed the public trust
thats what the judge explained to me
i had betrayed the public trust
the faa took my license
and thats fair
the chances of me flying again are slim to none
and i accept that
a large room houses an aa meeting for about inmates wearing white jumpsuits
whip continues his story
ive had time to think about all of it
doing a lot of writing
ive written letters to each of the families that lost loved ones on my flight
some were able to hear my apology some never will
ive also apologized to all the people who tried to help me along the way but i couldnt or wouldnt listen like my wife i mean my ex wife
he gets emotional and my son
again some were able to forgive me
some never will
but at least im sober and im grateful for that
whip gives it to us straight
and this is gonna sound really stupid coming from a man whos in prison
but for the first time in my life
we hold close on whips face as we hear the metallic clang of prison doors shutting
on the sound we cut to
we pan across the concrete cell wall looking at a small personal photo collage
we see a photo of nicole and sheila and a few other aa folks surrounding whip who sits in front of a birthday cake in the common room of the
we see a photo of whips dad as an airman
we ultimately land on a photo of nicole
we recognize it as the photo whip took on the porch of the whitaker farm
we pan down to find whip writing in a journal
a guard comes to the front of his cell
whitaker you got a visitor
whip looks at the guard and nods before taking a last glance at the photo of nicole
whip sits at a lone picnic table in a fence enclosed courtyard
he checks his watch and looks up
whip stands and walks towards us towards his visitor
as he gets closer we see a smile break across his face
a smile we havent seen since he first saw nicole
we reverse to see
will whips year old son stands next to a guard
you have minutes
knuckles youre looking good
i sent you something for your birthday
i got it
another beat as they cant find a way in to a conversation
this is a real surprise a great surprise
i havent seen you whip chokes up
whip motions to the table and they both sit
will pulls out a notebook
college counselor thought i should come and interview you
im writing essays for college applications
whip studies him and laughs
will nods and tries to smile
listen will it means everything to me that you came here
you are an amazing kid and you deserve great things
again whip has to tamp down his emotions
so can you help me with this essay
will pulls out a small voice recorder and clicks it on
i have to do an essay called the most fascinating person ive never met
the two men just look at each other
and thats me
will nods both men are struggling to keep it together
can we pick up where we left off
whip nods unsure as to where this is going
who are you
a great familiar question
he begins to alternately laugh and sob as there is great relief in the promise of a connection with his son
