written by guillermo arriaga april day breaks
hassan arrives at a solitary house made of adobe in the southern deserts of morocco carrying a satchel and a large bundle wrapped in cloth
he walks past a corral made out of branches where several goats bleat and knocks on the front door
in arabic good morning abdullah
i brought you this
he holds up the bundle
abdullahs family is inside the house
there is a room a small table and a simple kitchen
yasira is roasting some goat meat assisted by yamil and zora her daughters
abdullah and his sons yussef and ahmed are sitting on the floor around the small table looking at a well conserved
caliber winchester rifle
to abdullah its almost new
he takes out several boxes of cartridges from his satchel
three hundred cartridges
he opens a box and shows them one of the golden bullets
the hunter who gave it to me said you can hit up to three kilometers away
how much do you want for everything
one thousand dirhams
one thousand dirhams
ill give you one thousand and a goat
abdullah and hassan exchange a look and hassan smiles
hassan and abdullahs family are behind the house
hassan stands with the rifle in front of a rock some twenty yards away and he turns toward abdullah
with this rifle your sons will be able to kill plenty of jackals
he aims at the rock and pulls the trigger without holding the rifle properly
it is clear that he doesnt know how to fire a weapon and the shot cracks loudly
the rifle kicks and hits him roughly in the shoulder
the bullet flies far wide of the rock
the women laugh nervously
rubbing his shoulder hassan turns to abdullah
let one of your sons shoot
abdullah looks at his boys and points at the younger one
let yussef shoot
when hassan is about to hand yussef the rifle ahmed cuts him off upset
i want to shoot first
father and son exchange an angry glance
hassan without realizing it turns and gives the rifle to ahmed
the boy grabs the gun it is heavier than he thought
look load it like this
hassan opens the chamber inserts the bullet and then closes it
once it is loaded he points at the safety
this is the safety
push it in when youre ready
unsure of himself he raises the rifle and almost without aiming fires
the shot kicks up dust far from the rock
his sisters laugh
if he doesnt hit the jackals at least hell scare the shit out of them
ahmed lowers the rifle
his father grabs it and gives it to yussef enthusiastically
yussef grabs the rifle and loads it confidently
he lifts the rifle with ease and takes his time aiming
he seems innately skilled at the maneuver
he shoots and the bullet hits just below the rock
abdullah celebrates the shot and mockingly turns to hassan
now this kid shoots a hell of a lot better than you
yussef takes one of the goats out ties and ropes it and gives it to hassan
yasira approaches and gives abdullah a bag
abdullah takes it and turns to his sons
you better kill at least three jackals
and make sure no one sees you with the rifle hide it if you see someone approach you
abdullah and hassan go on their way
yasira and yamil are far from the house cleaning some goatskins stretched out on some branches
ahmed with the rifle in his hands opens the corral gate and enters to herd them out
he calls his brother
yussef is squatting on the other side of the house spying through a crack breathing excitedly
zora is inside undressing
she has a long body and her cinnamon skin is soft and clean
every now and then she aims a complicit glance at the crack through which yussef is spying
zora turns around toward where the voice is coming from
yussef is still spying
what are you doing
yussef turns around and signals for him to lower his voice
i told you not to spy on her again
yussef pays no attention and keeps spying
ahmed pulls him by the shoulder and makes him lose his balance
yussef falls on his ass
i said dont spy on her
yussef gets up and dusts himself off
what the hell do you care
come on lets go
he turns around and leaves
the goats graze
yussef and ahmed watch them sitting on the side of a hill
they look hot and bored
they both throw stones at a small rusty can
yussef throws one and misses
ahmed throws his and does
he draws a line in the ground
five to two
a jackal is stalking the goats
yussef spots it
theres a jackal over there
ahmed raises his head but cannot see it
yussef points at it but ahmed still cannot locate it
ahmed finally spots it
he loads the rifle but when he is about to aim the rifle fires
the shot hits amidst the goats lifting up a small cloud of dust
what are you doing you idiot
the jackal flees terrified while the goats scamper in different directions
both brothers are sitting under a tree eating bread and drinking water from a goatskin canteen
zora doesnt mind
ahmed keeps eating without turning to look at his brother
she doesnt but i do
this is between her and me
youre both pigs
next time im going to tell my dad
stay out of this
if you want me to stay out of it dont do it
yussef gets annoyed stand up and leaves
the brothers are sitting apart from each other
ahmed guards the goats with the rifle on his lap
after a while yussef goes to sit behind a large rock
he makes sure his brother isnt watching and he pulls his pants down to start masturbating
when he is at his most concentrated a shot rings out and startles him
he quickly pulls his pants up and another shot rings out
yussef gets up to see what his brother is doing
ahmed is aiming the rifle at a rock some two hundred yards away
he fires a third time
yussef runs up to him
what are you doing
ahmed doesnt pay attention and focuses on the rock in the distance
hassan said that it could hit things three kilometers away but it cant even reach that rock over there
thats because you dont know how to shoot
give me the rifle
ahmed looks at his brother defiantly then hands the rifle over
yussef aims and fires
the shot echoes through the vast desert the frightened goats scamper a few yards away
see it cant reach it
give me another bullet
yussef aims and fires
the bullet hits the rock and kicks up a lot of whitish dust
yeah but thats not three kilometers
ahmed remains pensive and suddenly starts climbing to the top of the hill
once at the top he looks around for a moment and then calls his brother
yussef come here
yussef climbs the slope
ahmed signals a road that in the distance cuts across the great desert plain and points out a traffic sign that indicates a curve ahead
i bet you the bullet cant hit that far away
ahmed loads the rifle and aims at the sign
he fires and nothing
these fucking bullets arent any good
youre not aiming right
yussef points at a yellow car driving along the road
whatll you give me if i hit that car
the empty cartridge falls to the ground
he fires again the car keeps going
yussef asks for the rifle
let me shoot
he also drops the used cartridge on the ground reloads and shoots the traffic sign
he fires and nothing
i told you
hassans a liar
a bus approaches
ahmed points at it
shoot at that one
yussef loads the rifle parsimoniously shuts the chamber raises the weapon aims and fires
the bus drives on
ahmed turns to his brother
the bus drives on another three hundred yards and suddenly stops in the middle of the road

so one day the hawk flew so so high that it crashed into an airplane
it fainted and started to fall
and when it was about to hit the ground all the birds flew toward him and saved him
they saved him
yes and when the hawk was healthy again he went to talk to the birds and said i want to thank you for saving me but i cant change and

the little birds answered we dont care that you hunt us because thats who you are
but we will always save you because thats who we are
the children are silent

amelia moves to turn out the light
leave it on
amelia stands still beside the switch

amelia sits down next to her and caresses her
a ti no te va a pasar eso

he wasnt angry he was just very sad
amelia doesnt know what else to say
she pats debbies head

they both nod and snuggle under their blankets
amelia watches them silently
the sun is just starting to rise
a phone rings distantly
she sits up listens intently and hears the ringing
she grabs a robe from a chair beside her puts it on and gets up to answer the phone
amelia enters the kitchen and answers a wall phone

amelia stares into empty space
debbie and mike are having breakfast while amelia leans on the sink and looks at them overwhelmed
to debbie in spanish do you want another quesadilla
amelia turns around to warm up a tortilla
mike stops eating his cereal and looks at her
how many little birds did the hawk eat
amelia turns around and sees mike who is truly worried
in english none because he started to like quesadillas
amelia strokes his hair
a car horn honks
amelia looks out and sees a school bus parked outside the house
is the bus here
in spanish yes but today youre not going to school

amelia turns around and walks out to the street
through the door we can see her saying something to the bus driver
the school bus leaves and amelia walks back into the house

richard tall thin weathered and susan good looking with an athletic body visit the impressive casbah with a group of american french and english tourists
most of them are old with a few couples in their forties or fifties
anwar a man with a kind face is the tour guide showing them around
in english with an arabic accent the berbers built these kasbahs
they made them like forts and here they would reside after finishing their caravans
richard listens attentively
susan looks hot
this place is beautiful dont you think
not very enthusiastically yeah yeah its very pretty
anwar walks toward one end of the aisles and calls the group
now id like to show you the materials that were used to build the walls
the herd moves docile toward anwars voice
the group of tourists spread about a small eatery with open air tables on a dusty terrace
a bus is parked behind them
at a table on one end of the terrace with views to a cluster of mountains richard and susan look through some menus
richard seems at ease in this place
susan appears to be bothered by the dust and otherness
a waiter brings a plate and some cutlery
in broken english you want to order
ill have a chicken cous cous and a coke please
what do you have that doesnt have fat in it
everything is delicious
susan reads the menu again
ill have the fried eggplant and a diet coke
we dont have diet coke
then a regular coke
the waiter smiles and goes to place the order
susan takes out a small bottle with antibacterial gel cleans her hands and then starts wiping the plate and the cutlery thoroughly
richard looks at the mountain range through a pair of binoculars
he spots a hawk flying over the plains
look look a hawk
richard follows the hawk with his binoculars for a few seconds and then puts them down
this country is incredible
susan remains silent and then turns to look at him
richard why did we come here
what dyou mean why
i thought you would like it
really why are we here
richard knows that susans answer implies something else
to forget everything to be alone
susan sardonically gestures toward the other tourists with her chin
richard sighs in disappointment
the waiter arrives with the cokes and the food which does not look particularly appetizing
he leaves everything on the table and goes
richard is about to pour his drink when susan stops him
throw out the ice
the coke is warm
yeah but you dont know what kind of water is in there
she grabs richards glass and tosses out the ice
then she does the same thing with hers
they are quiet for a moment
why cant you ever relax
youre always stressed
youre the one stressing me out
youre why i cant relax
you could if you tried
dont you think i tried
youre never going to forgive me are you
do you even know what im talking about
susan please we didnt come all this way just to argue
susan gets angry and faces him
oh we didnt
then when are we supposed to argue
or are you planning on running away again
richard sighs defeated
they stop speaking and sit looking at the mountains
the tourists crowd around to board the bus
some boys in rags approach to sell them trinkets
some of the tourists buy them
they come to susan who becomes instantly uncomfortable
she gestures with her hand to say they have no money but the kids insist
i dont have any money
i dont have any
richard takes off his binoculars and gives them to the youngest of the boys who receives them with wide eyes
what are you doing
richard just gets in the bus
susan stares at the boy with the binoculars for a moment and then gets in
susan sits next to the window in the middle of the bus
she looks hurt and sad
richard walks over and sits next to her
the bus starts
through the window richard can still see the boy with the binoculars
he smiles until he sees an older boy snatch the binoculars away and push the little boy
the bus drives away but richard cant take his eyes off the scene
the older boy walks away with the binoculars
the bus drives down a straight road that divides the desert
the bus drives on
some of the old men sleep
susan leans her head against the window and watches the landscape scroll past
richard sits beside her silently
susan holds out her hand and takes richards as a sign of reconciliation
he holds hers and caresses it
susan gets comfortable to try to sleep
she closes her eyes when suddenly something smashes the window and susan collapses forward
richard turns to look at the punctured glass and then susan
susan whats wrong
susan doesnt answer limp on her seat
richard lifts her up and when he does he sees a thread of blood run down her neck
richard yells at the driver
stop the bus stop my wifes been hurt
in an indoor volleyball court with bleachers several japanese girls play volleyball
they all compete intensely for the point
there is excitement but everything occurs quietly
a player jumps and spikes the ball
chieko tall beautiful with strands of hair painted purple volleys the ball back up
it reaches one of her teammates who sets up another to spike it
chiekos team wins the point
the referee instead of whistling lifts up a red flag
the players congratulate each other silently in sign language
the only sound we can here is the parents clapping as they watch the game from the stands
chiekos team serves
again the game is heated
a rival player spikes the ball and it is barely out of bounds
however the referee with his red flag calls the point
chieko is upset and goes to argue with him
in sign language the ball was out
in sign language no it was good
chieko gestures violently
one of her teammates goes to calm her down
let it go
chieko breaks loose and approaches the referee
that was out
it was on the line
youre not just deaf youre blind
chieko is furious
she starts to make obscene gestures
youre an asshole
the coach walks onto the court
he holds her to calm her down and then takes her away
despite chiekos violent reaction everything is still silent
from the bleachers yasujiro chiekos father dressed in a nice suit with the tie undone with a sad pride about him disapproves of his daughters actions
chieko sits on a bench in her underwear
she looks aggravated and absorbed in her own thoughts
her other teammates get dressed
two of them walk past wrapped in towels freshly showered and stand in front of her
they talk to each other in sign language
you shouldnt have lost your temper
we lost the game
it wasnt my fault it was the ref
if you hadnt been thrown out we wouldve won the game
chieko angry gets up and starts to rummage through her locker
her teammate walks over and gets her attention
why are you in a bad mood
chieko doesnt answer
shes always in a bad mood because nobodys fucked her yet
she caps this with an obscene gesture that bothers chieko
im gonna fuck your dad to get rid of my mood
teammate laughs amused
teammate gives chieko a scornful look
chieko smiles sardonically
yasujiro drives while chieko looks at the swarming tokyo streets
she is wearing a skirt revealing of her long volleyball legs
her fathers speaks to her in sign language
what do you want to eat
i said id meet my friends from the team at eves
werent we going to have lunch together
dad i told you i was going to eat with them but you never pay attention to me
yasujiro shakes his head in disapproval
my mother always paid attention to me
why do you want to fight
they dont say anything else
the traffic is chaotic
i miss your mother too
chieko just looks at him
im doing what i can sweetie
they dont say anything else
the traffic is chaos
yasujiro parks his car and chieko gets out
in sign language dont forget you have the dentist at four
chieko looks annoyed and blows her father a kiss goodbye
as she is about to get out of the car yasujiro grabs her arm
she turns to look at him
in sign language i love you very much
they exchange a glance
she nods closes the door and leaves
eves is a restaurant full of t
s noise video games
there is smoke and people talking everywhere
chieko moves through the crowd
a hostess intercepts her
do you have a table
chieko doesnt manage to read her lips
the hostess smiling awaits an answer
chieko waits expectant for the hostess to repeat herself
do you have a table
chieko nods and points at her group of girlfriends who are sitting on the barstools next to the bar
the hostess smiles another stupid smile and lets chieko by
further off her friends spot her and make silly faces
chieko laughs walks over to them
they are all dressed the same short skirts tight t shirts
some of them have piercings in their nose lips and ears
they all exude hormones in their silence
chieko goes to talk to them in sign language
why all the way in the corner
mitsu with a good body not very tall and with violet highlights in her hair points at a pair of tables where a group of young men are drinking beer
because of the view
chieko turns around and stares at one of them wearing a milan jersey
their eyes meet
chieko keeps her eyes on him and the boy finally turns away
do you like him
chieko nods without taking her eyes off him
chieko mitsu and another of their friends are playing a pinball game that makes noises whenever the ball hits a wall
the young man in the milan jersey approaches chieko
neither chieko nor her friends answer
the guy turns to look at one of his friends who signals for him to insist
can i play with you
chieko obviously cannot hear him
she keeps playing
suddenly mitsu notices the young mans presence and taps chieko on the shoulder
chieko turns around and is surprised
the young man turns to look toward his friends as he speaks
do you want to come have a drink
chieko gets frustrated she cannot read his lips
he stops looking at his friends and awaits an answer but all he sees is three silent girls staring at him stupefied
chieko talks to mitsu in sign language
tell him i couldnt read his lips
the young man upon seeing them communicate is caught off guard
he turns around and walks toward his friends without saying a word
chieko leans on the sink while mitsu pees in one of the stalls
chieko is noticeably upset
mitsu walks out of the stall fixing her skirt
she sees chieko is distressed
in sign language whats the matter
in sign language they look at us like were monsters
oh come off it
chieko is at a loss for words
mitsu stares at her it looks like another one of many tantrums
chieko hikes up her skirt and starts to pull down her panties
what are you doing
now theyre going to meet the real hairy monster
she makes the gesture of sticking her finger up a hole then goes to the toilet throws her panties in and flushes
she turns to look at mitsu defiantly who cannot help but laugh
chieko sits on one of the restaurants benches
before her is a new group of young men
mitsu and chieko exchange a look
provocatively chieko crosses her legs slowly revealing her pussy
one of the young men seems to notice and is stunned
chieko smiles and does it again
he watches chieko again and discretely turns to one of his friends to tell him
chieko turns her back to him and faces the bar
she looks over at mitsu who shakes her head amused
a beeper rings on chiekos skirt
she picks it up and reads dont forget your appointment with the dentist
she puts the beeper away and turns toward mitsu
ill see you later at my place
she mischievously turns toward the table where the young man was and as she gets off the bench she spreads her legs wide open flashing him shamelessly
she struts out
ahmed and yussef run full speed herding their goats as they go
some of them get left behind and yussef hurries back to them
as they climb a hill he slips and falls rolls downhill and drops the rifle which slides a few meters away
ahmed runs to help him
yussef gets up covered in dust and with a scratch on his forehead
ahmed picks up the rifle
hurry up man hurry
ahmed runs off hands flailing to herd the straggling sheep
yussef follows him limping
the brothers make it back home
agitated they put the goats back into their corral
zora walks out and approaches them
yussef busy closing the corral gate pays no attention
ahmed breathing agitatedly doesnt answer
i asked you whats wrong
ahmed full of adrenaline glances angrily at her
what do you care whore
yussef gets in the way
dont talk to her like that
yussef steps up to defend her but ahmed spins around and goes into the house
yussef turns to zora
something we ate make us sick so we came back
without another word yussef also goes into the house
yussef and ahmed are sitting on their mats looking at each other pale scared and quiet
yasira walks in to see them followed by her daughters
she turns to ahmed
what are you doing here
ahmed livid cannot answer
something we ate gave us a stomach ache
yasira stares harshly at ahmed
and is that why youre insulting your sister
ahmed looks at zora then yussef and then is silent
we were feeling really ill
yasira points toward the corral
the goats are going to feel even worse if they dont eat
take them out again
our stomach really hurts
then start jerking the meat
yasira walks out
yussef and zora exchange a look
yussef and ahmed are jerking a couple of young goats with very sharp knives
they set the thin strips on newspaper
they look nervous
they talk in whispers
dyou think something happened
i dont know
people were screaming
they are silent for a long while
it was your fault
yussef stares at him in disbelief
it was both our faults
we both shot
a beat swear to me youll never say anything
ahmed wont answer
yussef looks around the room to make sure nobody is listening to them
ahmed remains pensive
he sighs and answers
the brothers are hanging the strips of meat on ropes to dry them in the sun
an old valiant packed with seven men parks in front of the house and abdullah gets out
he raises his hand to say goodbye
thank you ill see you tomorrow
the driver also raises his hand and then drives off
abdullah turns to yussef
tell your mother to prepare dinner
abdullah turns towards the house
yussef comes out running towards a little field below the house
yasira is plowing with a manual plow
mother mother father says he wants to have dinner now
abdullah and his children sit at the small table while the women prepare the food
a column of smoke rises from the fire where they are roasting goat meat and toasting bread
yamil the youngest of the daughters sets some bread on the table
abdullah takes it tears some off and starts to eat
he turns to yussef
did you kill any jackals
we shot at them but didnt hit them
you have to kill them
if not theyre going to eat all the goats
yasira sets the strips of goat meat on the table
abdullah serves himself some
his children wait until hes done to serve themselves
why are you home so late
abdullah starts talking with his mouth full
they closed the road and we had to take the long way around
he swallows apparently some terrorists killed an american tourist
ahmed and yussef shoot each other a nervous glance
yes the terrorists attacked a tour bus on the road
but there arent any terrorists here
abdullah finishes his mouthful
he wipes himself with his sleeve
ahmed doesnt even dare raise his eyes
you never know
yussef nervous looks up
and how do you know the american died
thats what they were saying
the police are looking for the culprits
yussef and ahmed again exchange a furtive glance
an oil lamp in a nescafe jar lights the house
the family sleeps in the only two rooms in the house
one of them is the parents room the other the childrens
we hear a goat bleating in the darkness
the crunching of wood in the night cold
neither yussef nor ahmed can sleep
they both look at each other anxious
santiagos car crosses the border between san diego and tijuana
they drive through a green light at the crossing easily entering mexico without being stopped by three mexican customs officials
debbie and mike stare through the windows amazed at the new world they are entering other people other architecture other colors other noises
santiago turns towards them while hes driving
see how easy it is to get into paradise
is this mexico
in spanish yes this is mexico
my mom told us mexico is really dangerous
santiago turns toward the kids
in spanish yes its full of mexicans
amelia and santiago look at each other and smile
they drive through tijuana
mike and debbie continue to gaze awestruck through the windows
santiago turns to them
in spanish are you hungry
they both nod
do you like popsicles
santiago pulls over next to some stalls and the street vendors run out to offer them their products
the children eat their popsicles as they walk through the endless aisles of stalls past the vendors and their incessant banter
whats this flavor called
santiago answers before amelia
in spanish cajeta
its called cajeta
its the best thing ive ever tasted in my life
a beat can i buy some for my mom
shes gonna love them
amelia smiles and nods
the car drives out of the city and gets on a highway
the desert rises in all its magnitude and severity
santiago parks the car next to a junkyard
amelia and debbie run out and hide behind a fence
debbie pulls her underpants down to pee
troubled she looks at the mound of destroyed cars
are they crashed cars
did lots of people die
i guess so
i dont like mexico
they drive down the highway and then turn onto a path
they drive down the path at high speed lifting up clouds of dust
they arrive at a dusty hamlet in the middle of the desert a few houses no more than twenty some adorned with multicolored paper
several crates of soda are stacked up against a makeshift shed built out of yucca fronds
a group of musicians who play nortena music are setting up their instruments
there are various pickup trucks and smuggled cars parked around the hamlet
the guests are wearing their best fresh shirts big buckles almost new boots
amelia gets out first
a group of people sees her and comes over to greet her
all in spanish hey so you finally made it
her friends notices mike and debbie
you brought them
luis amelias son a typical norteno cowboy with long sideburns and moustache his face tanned from days under the sun wearing a pistachio colored tuxedo with a cloth flower in
the lapel greets amelia with a kiss
hi mom howre you doing
she looks him up and down
son you look like pedro infante
more like luis miguel
wheres the bride
shes not here yet
what dyou mean shes not here yet
well she aint here
mike and debbie struck dumb by the language and the strangers hide behind amelia who introduces them to luis
look son these are mike and debbie the kids i take care of
luis holds his hand out ceremoniously
pleased to meet you mike
santiago calls out to some kids who are running around
lucio come here
lucio the oldest of the gang approaches
santiago gestures toward the two american kids
these are mike and debbie
keep an eye on them for me
lucio gives them a scornful glance and calls them over half heartedly
come with me
with her hand amelia signals to the kids that its ok to go with him
shyly debbie and mike follow
amelia is in a room with her two daughters standing in front of a peeling and broken mirror putting on her violet gown
one of her daughters helps her and pulls the zipper all the way up
all in spanish oh ma i dont know how you did it but it zipped up perfectly
and its been years since i last wore this dress
you havent changed a bit ma
working dear working thats what keeps one young
the two sisters realize that the dress has a hole just below the seat exchange looks and smile which doesnt please amelia
what are you guys laughing about
nothing ma nothing
amelia looks at them suspiciously turns around and leaves the room with her dress elegantly torn
the bus is in the middle of the road
several of the tourists are hiding under their seats frightened
the driver still ducking looks toward the mountains to try to piece together what happened
richard holds susan against his shoulder blood gushing from her neck
her eyes are open and staring at a fading world
richard takes susan from under her armpits and carefully lays her down on the aisle
anwar runs over to help
take it easy honey take it easy
anwar takes his shirt off left only in his undershirt and puts it under susans neck
mumbling senselessly im ok
susan breathes in and every time she does blood flows from her wound
richard turns toward the other passengers
is anybody a doctor
richard starts to lose his cool
please a doctor
the pensioners dont answer they are too scared
richard opens susans purse and sees a cell phone
he turns it on and tries to call but there is no signal
he turns to anwar

its far away about four hours
a beat theres a clinic thats a little closer about an hour and a half to the south
by bus itll take us about two hours and a half though

yes but its the closest thing weve got
richard runs down the aisle and gets out of the bus
no cars drive by
the road is almost deserted
in the distance a run down renault approaches
richard stands in the road to stop it
the car brakes and richard runs toward the driver an old peasant traveling with his eight year old grandson
i need your help
we were attacked
in arabic i dont understand
richard grows desperate
in arabic i dont understand you sir
richard sees that anwar and the bus driver have gotten out of the bus and he starts shouting at them for help
tell him we need his help
with the distraction the old man drives off
richard watches helplessly as they drive away and he grabs anwar by the arm
lets take her to the clinic
the bus makes a u turn and drives away at full speed
the bus rattles along
richard huddles over susan trying to stop the blood flowing from her neck
barth an old man starts shouting
marrakech isnt this way
theyre going to shoot at us again
weve got to get her to a hospital
theyre going to kill us all
turn the bus around
richard gets exasperated at the old mans screaming
shut up god damn it
barth shuts up and the bus drives on
the bus bounces its way down the straight highway
the passengers sit quietly
as the ride gets bumpier susan starts to cry out in pain
it hurts it hurts
richard tries to calm her down
easy sweetie easy
it hurts so much
richard turns her around and sees her shoulder has been shattered
she wont stop shouting
a pool of blood starts trickling down the aisle
a anwar isnt there anywhere else we can take her
we can take her to my town
its near here and theres a doctor
in the meantime we can call erfourd for an ambulance
richard turns to look at susan who is writhing in pain
to the driver in arabic make a right onto the next road
richard and anwar exchange a glance
the bus leaves the main road and turns into a dirt road
the bus poor suspension gives the passengers a jolt
richard tries to protect susans head
the bus pulls into a small group of houses
several children run beside the bus chasing it
some gaunt dogs get out of the way to let the bus by
the bus pulls up in front of a modest house
richard raises his head and sees the desolate environs
are we here
yes sir this is my house
richard tries to carry susan but she screams in pain
easy darling easy
he slips his hands under her and lifts her up
dont touch me there
richard moves his hand which is covered in blood
as he carries her he turns into the aisle while anwar and one of the passengers try to help him
richard carries her into the house through a crowd of curious children
anwar leads richard down the hallways amidst susans screams
they walk through a dusty patio and anwar points at some stairs
richard climbs them with difficulty and anwar opens the door to a room
an old woman anwars grandmother who has centuries of desert in her expression lets them in and points at a rug on the floor
in arabic put her there
richard understands and softly lays susan on the rug
susan looks around horrified adobe walls dirt floor the epitome of the third world
i need to call an ambulance and contact my embassy

obviously richard does not have it
i need to make a phone call

they get ready to leave and susan starts imploring

susan looks desperate
to set richard somewhat at ease anwar points at his grandmother
she can take care of her
richard leans over susan
youre going to be ok
anwar kneels down next to her takes a cloth and improvises a tourniquet that he adjusts near her shoulder
he turns towards the grandmother
in arabic hold and release the tourniquet every once in a while
the grandmother nods
she sees the swarm of kids looking into the place and she shoos them away
in arabic get out of here
the kids obey except for one or two who take one last look before they go
susans terrified eyes watch anwar and richard leave the room
the bus is still parked in front of the house
as soon as richard walks out the pensioners approach him

richard and anwar walk down the streets of the small hamlet before the peoples inquisitive gaze
they arrive at a general store with all sorts of roots and grains displayed outside
anwar walks over to the owner
in arabic we need your phone
ill pay for the call
susan is lying on the floor desolate
it seems as if the pain is diminishing
the grandmother leans over her and softly caresses her with her dirty wrinkled hands
this startles susan
in arabic how do you feel
susan is a little bit uncomfortable with her this close
can i have some water
the old woman doesnt seem to understand
she grabs a basket of dates and offers them to her
susan shakes her head
with her hand susan mimes drinking a glass of water
the old woman seems to understand
she pours some water from a jar leans over her and helps her drink in small sips
the grandmother bows her head as if to say your welcome
wheres my husband
the old woman just smiles
susan makes a gesture of desperation
the grandmother leans over her unfurls her index finger and points at her heart
in arabic trust in god
susan keeps looking at her as she slowly gets up and goes to sit in a chair
richard is in a small cubicle dialing on an old cream colored rotary phone while anwar waits discretely in a corner
dozens of people watch from outside
richard turns to look at them while the call connects

richard returns to the room
susan weak lies with her eyes open
the grandmother is tending to the wound which wont stop bleeding
she gets up and goes to anwar
in arabic anwar bring me some water
anwar goes out to the patio and fetches a metal basin full of soil
he goes to a well scoops out some water with a gourd and washes out the basin
anwar is walking back when he is stopped by mohammed his brother a fat man with curly hair and a tanned face
the entire dialogue in arabic why did you bring them here
anwar doesnt pay attention to him and keeps walking toward the room
his brother catches up to him

anwar stops and looks at him fixedly
shes hurt we had to take care of her
in town theyre saying she was shot by terrorists

anwar pays no more attention to him and carries the basin into the room

a small pool of blood has collected under her neck
she looks restless
she whispers weakly

just then anwar enters
the grandmother takes the basin and sets it in a corner
she gets some pieces of cloth and starts to soak them

weve got to get her out of here
theres no one to tend to her

richard is going to say something but holds back
his despair and confusion are evident
trust my grandmother she knows a lot about remedies
the grandmother wrings out the rags and puts them on a table
she takes some herbs a fistful of earth from the floor and she tosses them into the basin
she stirs it and pulls out a clump of mud which she lays out on one of the pieces of cloth
susan looks horrified at the dirt
the grandmother leans over her and tries to clean the wound with the other moistened rags
in arabic i have to clean you
to susan miss my grandmother is going to help you
the grandmother finishes cleaning her with the damp cloths and grabs the clump of mud
she tries to put it on the wound but susan flinches
no not that
in arabic it will stop the bleeding
to anwar lets wait for the doctor
two old men walk through the streets
mohammed walks into the room and calls him
in arabic the sheik and the moukadem are here
the two men walk past the tourists and head inside without knocking or asking for permission
richard and anwar have walked out into the patio to wait for them
the sheik approaches

the sheik and the moukadem turn and exit the house
chieko is sitting in the reception area waiting her turn
there is a woman with a twelve year old son listening to a walkman and an old couple
the receptionist will not stop talking to the old lady
my niece sells these creams
and just look at my skin now
im going to turn fifty two and look almost no wrinkles
the woman continues her banal chatter
chieko observes her grotesque mouth
she then looks at the old mans bored face the old womans feigned interest the mothers annoyed expression and the boy who rocks his head to the music
a man walks out and the receptionist gestures at chieko and points toward the door
the dentist tall and unlike the receptionist with impeccable skin covering his hardened attractive face examines chiekos mouth
his face comes very close to hers as he looks at her making her nervous
the fat receptionist walks in without knocking
here are the sterilized drill bits
the dentist looks up at her
she leaves the drill bits on a table and leaves
the dentist turns back to chieko and speaks face to face with her so she can read his lips
i think you have two cavities in your molars
the dentist moves closer to chiekos mouth again she cannot stop looking at him
suddenly chieko licks his cheek
he is surprised but continues his checkup
she licks him again this time on the lips
he pulls away flustered
what are you doing
she grabs his hand puts it on her inner thigh and rubs it against her pubis
he confused tries to pull his hand away but she prevents him from doing so
the scene starts to turn slightly grotesque
after a slight struggle he pulls his hand back
whats the matter with you
she grabs his hand again and again pulls it toward her pubis
he gets angry and moves back
the fat woman enters again without knocking sees they are agitated and without a word walks out and closes the door
the dentist turns toward chieko
she shakes her head
she is excited anxious scared fragile
he pulls her by her wrist out of the chair
get out right now
he walks to the door and opens it
just before she walks out chieko draws out a slight smile which is almost a grin
chieko walks down crowded tokyo streets
she walks with a lost gaze unsettled
chieko arrives at an upper class apartment complex
the architecture is cutting edge but impersonal and cold
chieko enters the lobby
beside the doorman are two men dressed in suits kenji and hamano
the janitor gestures at chieko with his chin
the men walk over toward her and cut her off
are you yasujiro watayas daughter
chieko doesnt manage to read his lips
she is silent
the doorman notices the situation walks out from behind his small desk and shouts at the men
shes deaf mute
face her when you speak so she can read your lips
kenji and hamano are disconcerted
hamano stands squarely in front of her and speaks slowly emphasizing every word
are you yasujiro watayas daughter
we are sargeants kenji mamiya and hamano kanoo of the tokyo police
we need to find your father
she pulls out a pen and a piece of paper from her bag
she scrawls a few lines and hands them over
hamano reads it and turns his face toward hers
no he didnt do anything wrong
we just want to talk to him
do you know where he is
she shrugs her shoulders
kenji gives her his card
upon receiving it chieko turns to look at him
their eyes meet and she looks down
she then looks up again blushing
tell him to call us
and dont be scared were not going to do anything bad to him
chieko cant stop staring at kenji
the two cops leave
as soon as they do chieko heads toward the elevator
chieko walks into the apartment
it is a large apartment elegantly furnished
although decoration is scant some hunting trophies stand out a scimitar horned oryx sheep and others
there are also photographs of yasujiro hunting
a wall is dedicated to family photos
among them is a picture of chieko as a little girl with her father and her mother
chieko sees a note on the table at the entrance
she puts the policemans card down and picks up a note from her father that says i waited until five and you didnt make it
ive got a meeting and ill be back late
i left you some soup and some chicken for dinner
chieko sits in front of a mute t
she stops at a fashion show then some cartoons
suddenly on a news program we see the photographs of ahmed and yussef
chieko looks at them for a moment and then changes the channel
she is watching t
when a red bulb set between a yellow bulb and a blue one starts to light up insistently as the doorbell rings
chieko notices and shuts off the t
chieko opens the door and mitsu walks in
they greet each other with a handshake where they end up touching their index fingers to each others hearts
are you ready
yeah im just going to get my bag
chieko goes to get her bag
mitsu sees the policemans card on the entrance table and looks at it
chieko comes back and mitsu asks her about it in sign language
the cops came again
they hadnt come in nine months
but these were different cops
did they come to ask about your mothers death
no but theyre probably going to ask my dad about the same things
theyre just not convinced are they
chieko shakes her head remains pensive and then smiles
believe it or not i liked one of the cops
chieko puts kenjis card in her purse
did you put on some panties
chieko smiles lifts up her skirt and exposes her naked pubis
mitsu lifts hers up as well and is also without panties
they laugh and leave the apartment
the desert is a rose plain softly lit by the suns first rays
yussef and ahmed are digging a hole with their bare hands
once theyre finished they clean up around the hole and mark it with three stones
alarid a federal cop tall in an impeccable uniform with numerous rank badges stands on the highway examining the site of the shot with the old man who was driving
in the distance we can see a police checkpoint stopping some cars and after checking them letting them go
to the old man the entire dialogue in arabic are you sure it was here
i drive down this road every day
the american tried to stop me right here
he stands more or less where richard tried to stop him
i was scared
he was covered in blood and i was coming from picking up my grandson from his work
where was the bus
the old man points some twenty yards behind him
alarid walks toward where the old man said and looks out at the mountains
some of his men are visible at the tops
alarid talks to them by radio
look further to the right
we can see some men exploring the terrain
to the old man why did you wait so long to contact the police
i had to drive my grandson home
the radio crackles
captain alarid captain alarid
we found the cartridges
alarid squats scrutinizing the four empty cartridges lying on the earth
one of his men approaches and alarid signals with his hand for him to stop immediately
stop right there
the man remains motionless
alarid follows the prints that lead away from the cartridges
he reaches the mess of goat hoof prints
he picks up a ball of shit and feels it
theyre from around here
find out who has a
yussef and ahmed walk back home lost in their own thoughts
suddenly a jackal trots out and stares at them
yussef picks up a rock and throws it
the jackal runs off
hassan and his wife are listening to the radio and playing cards at a table placed outside the house
as they play hassan whittles a stake with a small knife
hassans wife lowers her hand and hassan follows
his wife pushes two chips from her pile toward him
in the distance several trucks approach kicking up a dust cloud
hassans wife gets up to better see them
are you expecting anyone
hassan stands up and watches the vehicles come closer
five trucks pull up in a semicircle around the house
a dozen police officers get out armed and aim at hassan and his wife
alarid gets out and stands next to his car door
hassan paralyzed by fear answers in a broken voice
one of the police officers approaches him aiming directly at his head while another one aims at his wife
drop your weapon
hassan lifts up his knife and shows it to them
its not a weapon its my knife
drop it now
hassan drops the knife in the dust
get down on the floor
hassan and his wife look at each other before they obey
what did we do
the cop readies himself to fire and hassan drops to the ground
his wife follows and also lies on her stomach
abdullah takes two goats out of the corral ties a rope to their neck and drags them over to a rock
the goats bleat desperately trying to break free
abdullah turns to look at his children
yussef and ahmed hold their legs
abdullah pulls out a knife and slits the goats throat
hassan lies on the floor cuffed with a broken mouth surrounded by cops
alarid is carrying out the interrogation squatting next to hassans face
why did you shoot at the bus
i didnt shoot at anyone
then who you idiot
hassan remains silent and turns to look at his wife who is sitting on a chair cuffed a few yards away
it wasnt me
alarid punches him in the face
that was your rifle
no not anymore i sold it today
abdullah gives yussef and ahmed some goat skins
take these goat skins to naguib and see if he wants to buy them
the two brothers bundle up the skins tie them up with some cord and they leave down the path away from the house
as they climb a hill they encounter a convoy of moroccan police trucks
they are terrified
the vehicles screech to a dramatic halt before them lifting up much dust
alarid opens the passenger window
hey do you know where abdullah adboum lives
ahmed and yussef exchange a glance
ahmed gets very nervous
yussef points the wrong way with an air of certainty
over there you have to cross those mountains
they told us he lived around here
no we just live here with our mother
abdullah lives over there
alarid scrutinizes the brothers faces
if youre lying to me im going to come back and cut your balls off
ahmed breathes nervously
yussef continues in cold blood
you can come back whenever you like
alarid smiles and gestures at the driver with his head that they should go on
the police vehicles drive off in the direction yussef pointed them in
ahmed and yussef run home
their mother and sisters are milking some goats into a tin bucket
when they fill abdullah empties the milk out into a barrel
abdullah puts the bucket down on the floor and turns to look at his kids who stop before him panting exhilarated
ahmed can barely control his gasping
theyre looking for you
no theyre not looking for you
theyre looking for us
because of what happened to the tourist
yasira and her two daughters stop milking and approach
abdullah cant seem to understand what their talking about
yussef killed her
thats not true we both did
what are you saying
ahmed fires his words out
yussef started shooting at the cars because hassan said that the bullet could go really far
thats a lie you started shooting at the cars
yes but you killed her
abdullah loses his patience and grabs ahmed by the shoulders
what the hell are you talking about
ahmed looks at his father straight in the eyes
yussef killed the american and he spies on zora naked and zora lets him watch her
abdullah turns toward zora
in his mind everything is confusion
what is your brother talking about
its not bullshit shes a whore and my brother spies on her
as soon as the words leave ahmeds mouth yussef decks him and leaves him sprawled on the dust
ahmed shoots right back up and runs at yussef kicking until theyre both entangled in the fight and end up rolling on the ground
abdullah tries to get between them
debbie and mike are almost like spectators at a soccer match between the other kids as they play in the dirt with an orange plastic ball
nobody passes to them
mike just runs from side to side without saying a word
frustrated debbie just watches
nside the house amelia is checking on the food
all in spanish how many pots of rice did you make

amelia looks out the window and sees the vast amount of guests that have arrived and which have transformed the hamlet into a large parking lot of trucks horses carts
too many people have come thats not going to be enough
make two more pots
she turns to another of her daughters
and you maria eugenia warm up more tortillas
she sees santiago walk past the window

santiago stops and looks through the window
out back santiago sees a car arrive
a priest steps out

mike and debbie stand still without knowing what to do
santiago calls them
mike and debbie

the chickens walk around a rustic chicken coop made with wire mesh and mesquite posts
santiago opens the door to the coop and lets the kids in mike and debbie among them
once inside santiago tells them to catch the chickens
in spanish ill give ten pesos to the first one of you who catches a chicken
the kids start chasing the chickens which scamper as soon as they feel hands trying to grab them
at first mike and debbie dont know what to do but they are soon amused and run to catch them
after a while debbie catches one and holds it up
santiago applauds her
debbie is the winner
now we need another five
the kids get back to their game of catching chickens
santiagos car drives down the road with a terrible sun beating down on it
luis drives while amelia looks out the window
both in spanish did you get into a fight with patricia

santiago has several chickens tied up
one of the kids catches the last one and hands it to santiago
in spanish ready

several children raise their hands
mike and debbie raise theirs as well excited
santiago picks mike

proud mike walks toward santiago and stands next to him
santiago unties a chicken and gives it to mike
hold it tight like this
he shows him how to hold it
mike grabs it and holds it between his arms smiling oblivious to what will happen
santiago grabs the chicken by the head and pulls it off
the chicken starts to shake spurting blood everywhere
mike stunned lets the animal fall to the ground and the chicken starts its mad race
the mexican kids start screaming excitedly chasing the headless chicken
nobody notices that debbie and mike completely shocked are about to cry
they arrive at the brides house
a car adorned with ribbons is parked outside
there is no one to be seen
luis honks the horn

as amelia gets out patricias mother appears upset
whats the matter
patricias not feeling well
santiago and the other kids are plucking the chickens feathers
mike and debbie stare horrified

santiago smiles to himself

a bearded man on an old bicycle rides down the hamlets narrow streets
he is carrying a briefcase on the bike
he is escorted by dozens of children
susan is lying on the floor moaning softly
flies hover around the pool of blood under her neck
richard worried strokes her hair
the grandmother brings them a pot of tea with two cups and sets them on the floor beside them
the grandmother goes to sit in a chair
mohammed walks in and whispers something to him
anwar turns to richard
the doctors here
the doctor walks across the patio through the tumult of children and before the scrutiny of two police officers
the doctor enters the room
in arabic allah be with you
in arabic allah be with you
richard just bows his head slightly
the doctor walks over to susan shoos the flies away and examines the wound
she looks at him anxious
in arabic the bullet didnt hit her spine or split her jugular
but it did shatter her clavicle and she could bleed to death
anwar looks worried
what did he say
he says she will be fine
stop lying to me god damn it and tell me what the fuck he said
the doctor addresses richard in terrible english
yes we know that
what can you do in the meantime
in arabic to anwar tell him i have to stitch up the wound to stop the bleeding
anwar draws close to richard and whispers
he has to sew up her wounds
susan turns to look at them suspicious
what did he say
richard gets nervous
you need some stitches
what do you mean stitches
the doctor opens his kit and takes out a rudimentary needle and thread
he gets ready to sew
richard questions him also in whispers
youre not going to give her any anesthetic
the doctor and anwar exchange a look
to richard no he doesnt use anesthetic
what kind of doctor is he
anwar answers naively in a low voice
hes a veterinarian but he is good
richard looks at him surprised and angry
he cant take care of her
richard he might infect the wound
richard cant answer as he focuses on what the doctor says
in arabic tell him that if i dont stitch up her wound she may bleed to death
if he doesnt sew up the wound she may bleed to death
in arabic to anwar and tell him her clavicle is broken
we have to fasten a splint to it
he says she has a broken bone and he has to put a splint on it
richard remains pensive for a moment
he looks at susan then at the doctor and assents tentatively
in arabic were going to have to hold her down
he mimes holding her down with his hands
richard leans over susan who weakly languishes on the rug
honey this is going to hurt a little
she stares at him
richard turns to anwar and signals that he can begin
anwar holds her hands
susan stupefied to richard
richard dont let him
the doctor lifts susans neck and starts to stitch
she howls in pain and tries to move away
anwar and richard hold susan down
the doctor sticks the needle in again
susan shakes her head from side to side trying to pull away
dont let him dont let him
susan they have to sew you up
richard holds her head to keep her still
honey please try to relax
the doctor rubs alcohol on the wound and starts to stitch
she moans in pain
richard puts a rag in her mouth on which she bites down
mohammed sits outside with three friends drinking coffee
from where they are we see the bus and the american tourists
a battery powered radio plays moroccan music and commercials in the background
i dont understand why anwar brought them here
well he spends all his time with them what do you expect
the woman is hurt he had to help her
and when have they helped us
i liked one of those tourists
theyre all skin and bones
suddenly mohammed focuses on the radio
the friends are quiet
today near tazarine there was an incident where an american was shot
one of the friends interrupts
hey look its the story
they said tazarine did you hear
we were on the radio
shh shut up
although authorities say it could have been a foiled robbery the american government claims they are certain it was a terrorist attack
minister hassef hazal has said that in our country terrorist cells have been eradicated that morocco is a peaceful country and that one act of vulgar banditry followed by superficial
evaluations such as the u
intends to place upon it cannot ruin the image the economy and the pacifist reputation of our country
american ambassador ken jones however insists that it was a terrorist attack on american citizens that it merits a full investigation and that the guilty should be punished
so far the attack has not been attributed to any known terrorist organizations
i fucking told anwar i told him he was only going to get us in trouble
he never comes and when he does he always brings trouble
god damn it
are the americans going to invade our country
i dont know
susan lies on the floor with her neck shoddily stitched and a splint on her shoulder made out of a few sticks and some dirty bandages
she moans in pain and mumbles curses
i hate you
i hate you
she tries to stand but the doctor impedes it
to anwar in arabic tell her not to move the bullets still inside

i want to call the kids
you cant move calm down

she seems obsessed by the idea
i want to talk to them
she tries to stand again
as they struggle the grandmother takes out a hash pipe form a drawer and lights it
she gives it two drags and squats next to susan
she shows her how to smoke it and hands it over
the old womans serenity is such that susan acquiesces
she takes four drags and slowly starts to relax
susan smokes another three times relaxes and closes her eyes
the old woman goes to get the clump of mud and starts to spread it on susans neck
susan does not protest
richard watches the scene in awe
the bus is still parked outside anwars house
some of the passengers sit leaning against the wall scrutinized by some of the towns children and women who have offered them tea and dates
the driver sits in the drivers seat and stares out at the desolate landscape through the windshield
several of the tourists nap in their seats
one of them a french tourist robert starts to breathe with difficulty
jane his wife is alarmed
in french are you ok
robert nods but it is clear that he is not
jane shouts at the driver
in french could you please turn on the air conditioning
the driver shakes his head regretfully

tom stands up and goes to yell at the driver

tom resolutely walks up the stairs followed by james
richard is looking out the window while susan relaxed sleeps
tom and james walk in making noise
weve gotta talk to you
richard with his index finger signals for him to shut up and points at susan
he gestures for them to leave the room
tom james and others are gathered by the door
you cant leave us like this
there are old people here and the heat is getting to them
at least wait until an ambulance comes
one man almost fainted in the bus and theres a woman who needs to get back in time to take her medication
richard turns to anwar

richard breathes relieved
chieko walks down the street with mitsu
they are good looking and attract attention
they know this and look back out of the corners of their eyes
they arrive at a park with a playground swings see saws slides
several of their deaf mute volleyball friends are there
with them are two young men with hair dyed blond
one of them takeshi has an earring and the other haruki has several tattoos
mitsu and chieko greet them in sign language
chieko asks the slightly chubby kumiko who they are
theyre my cousins
chieko turns to look at them curious
haruki the guy with tattoos exchanges a look with her
chieko suddenly feels intimidated and looks down
is he deaf mute like us
no but he understands some
haruki seems to understand what theyre saying and leans in to whisper something to takeshi his brother
they both laugh
haruki approaches chieko and talks to her face to face so she can read his lips
whats your name
chieko and her friend smile
chieko takes out her notebook and pen and writes her name
haruki reads it out loud
my names haruki
chieko nods trying to show shes understood
haruki takes out a flask and holds it out to her
chieko opens it and smells it
haruki stands in front of her
chieko smiles and gives a long swig
mitsu asks for some and also gives it a long drink
do the cops come around here
haruki takes out some ecstasy and gives it to them
mitsu and chieko look at each other and down the pills with a gulp of whisky
half drunk and rushing from the pills chieko her friends and haruki and takeshi play on the swings and see saw
they laugh at almost anything
haruki and chieko are on the see saw and every time chieko rises haruki looks at her bush
chieko knows this sometimes opens her legs even more so he can look to his hearts content
hormones float in the air
mitsu also takes advantage of the occasion
she flirts with haruki whenever she can
haruki looks happy to be the object of their attention
takeshi who has started to make out with one of chiekos friends turns to the group and speaks slowly
why dont we go to montana
night begins to fall
haruki sits between mitsu and chieko
he strokes chiekos knee with his hand she seems turned on
the taxi parks outside the montana
chieko mitsu and haruki get out of the car and meet with the others at the door
the music the light the crowd it is almost hallucinatory
for chieko it is a silent concert of movement and chaos
she and her friends push their way through the place
haruki grabs chieko by the hand pulls her toward the floor and starts dancing
chieko looks at the other dancers rhythm and follows
she slowly manages to follow
the other deaf mutes also dance
some do better than others lost in the sea of lights and people
for chieko the dance turns into something hypnotic
she dances with her eyes closed concentrated on her own rhythm
when she opens her eyes she sees that mitsu a little drunk is grinding against haruki feeling him up
chieko seems annoyed by this and goes to defend her territory
she starts dancing next to haruki but she is constantly interrupted by the surrounding crowd
the struggle between chieko and mitsu is a little bit ridiculous
it is finally resolved when mitsu takes haruki by the face and starts to kiss him
chieko doesnt know what to do
mitsu and haruki start to make out intensely
suddenly chieko is left standing in the middle of the club motionless while her friends dance awkwardly and mitsu and haruki are having the time of their lives
chieko defeated by her friend decides to leave
mitsu spots her out of the corner of her eye and waves goodbye
chieko smiles back and walks away from her friends as they dance
chieko enters her building and goes straight to the doorman
good evening how may i help you
chieko takes out a piece of paper and a pen from her purse and writes a note
she gives it to the doorman together with kenjis card
he reads it carefully and when hes done he turns to her
very well miss ill call him now
the doorman picks up a cordless phone and dials
lieutenant kenji mamiya please
there is a pause
the doorman gestures to chieko that the lieutenant will answer in a moment
yes look im with the deaf mute girl you saw in the afternoon and she asked me to call you
she says she needs to talk to you alone
about her father
if its possible in her apartment tonight
chieko watches attentively
yussef and ahmed are sitting against the wall of the house
yussefs lip is split
ahmeds nose is bleeding
abdullah paces desperately while his wife and daughters watch the scene silent
abdullah stops to look at yussef
why did you do this
they dont answer
abdullah leans over and slaps ahmed
answer me god damn it
ahmed wont answer and he turns to yussef again
we were testing the rifle
abdullah turns and gives yussef a powerful slap which he endures with silent dignity
are you idiots
you killed a woman he turns to zora and you you got naked so your brother would see you
yes she got naked lots of times
i saw how yussef spied on her
thats not true
abdullah turns to yussef
is it true or not
yussef is silent
abdullah walks two steps forward and slaps zora
he looks furious scared indignant
why did you do this to us
he can barely hold in his tears
zora brings her hand to her face tearily
abdullah turns to ahmed
wheres the rifle
a cop interrogates hassan
his face is badly bruised and his hands are cuffed behind his back
what organization gave you the weapon
ive told you it wasnt an organization i got it from a hunter
a japanese hunter gave it to me many years ago
ive got a picture inside
she can get it
he turns to look at his wife
she has also been beaten and is guarded by two cops
the interrogating cop authorizes her
she walks in and comes out with a photograph of hassan with yasujiro posing with the scimitar horned oryx
he hands it over and the cop examines it
hes holding the rifle he gave me
yussef and ahmed dig up the rifle and the bullets in front of their parents and sisters
abdullah grabs the rifle dusts it off and puts the bullets in his bag
he turns to yasira
were going to hide out at naguibs house
if the cops come tell them we went south
with the rifle in hand abdullah runs off followed by yussef and ahmed
the women watch them get lost on the horizon
alarids truck parks in front of hassans house again
hassan is still cuffed and being interrogated
furious alarid gets out of the truck and goes toward him
this abdullah doesnt live where you said he did
he walks over to kick him
the wife intervenes from where she is some ten yards away
they live where he said they do
alarid turns to her
youre going to take us
with a gesture he orders his subordinates to put her in the truck
she obeys docile
and if theyre not there ill cut your tongue out and ill kill your husband
the moroccan police trucks drive down the dusty roads
the landscape is harsh and barren
hassans wife gives directions
make a right here
alarid with his hand signals the driver to follow her directions
suddenly in the distance over the hills she signals three tiny dots running up a slope
to the driver stop
the trucks stop and alarid takes out his binoculars
in the distance we can still see abdullah yussef and ahmed run across the hills
abdullah is clearly carrying the rifle
alarid quickly gets out
there they are
all the cops get out with their high powered rifles
abdullah and his sons run full speed
yussef sees the trucks in the distance
the police the police
they run up a hill to try to lose them but shots start to ring out
theyre shooting at us
abdullah stands before his sons and lifts up the rifle as a sign of surrender
the shots cease for a few seconds but they suddenly start again
the three shepherds run huddling as low as they can
they desperately climb between the rocks
bullets whiz past everywhere
abdullah makes one last attempt at surrender
he lifts up the rifle again sets it on the ground and backs away
but the gesture is in vain as the bullets still rush past
they begin to run again when ahmed is hit in one of his calves
he collapses and rolls downhill
abdullah hurries to rescue him and drags him behind a rock
ahmed wont stop screaming from the pain
they shot me they shot me
yussef dives on his belly and snakes his way through the rocks
he gets the rifle loads it and aims at the trucks
he shoots without hitting anything
abdullah turns to him
dont shoot dont shoot
yussef doesnt pay attention
he loads again and aims
yussef aims carefully
he picks out one of the cops who has been shooting barely protected by one of the trucks fenders
yussef shoots and the policeman collapses
the religious ceremony has ended and everyone throws rice at the bride and groom
debbie and mike enjoy doing it
several cowboys among them santiago have gone to their trucks and are loudly honking their horns
music begins to blare
the band plays various norteno songs
everyone waits for the music to start
after a while a couple starts to timidly dance
then another and another until the dance floor becomes a sway of heads moving to the same rhythm
amelia dances with mike and debbie with santiago both amelia and santiago show them a few steps
to debbie in spanish like this look
he kicks his heel back then forward
debbie watches entertained
jacinto overweight and with a good natured face moves closer to amelia and watches her dance for a while she notices and stops embarrassed
both in spanish amelia will you let me dance with you
amelia remains unperturbed without answering him
ive been asking you for a dance for years
does it really cost you that much
amelia stares at him
i dont think your wife would have liked that
cmon amelia shes been dead for years
amelia looks around and then turns to him
okay just one
jacinto chivalrously takes her by the waist and they begin to dance
santiago watches them amused and continues to dance with mike and debbie
jacinto draws amelia closer and they kiss gently
beer starts to flow and some of the guests get overbearing
there is a small scuffle at the edge of the dance floor but order is soon restored
the guitarist in the band stops the music
all in spanish now luis and patricia come forward
everyone makes way for the bride and groom
we want cake we want cake
the audience and the band sing the little cake song
a giant tacky wedding cake covered in cream arrives
the bride grabs the knife and gets ready to cut it
take a bite take a bite
the bride gives into the ritual
she tries to take a bite out of the cake without using her hands and someone pushes her face into the cream
debbie and mike laugh
a cowboy pulls out a gun and festively fires
debbie is frightened and goes to hide behind amelia
dont worry its ok
the man puts the gun away and walks back onto the dance floor as if nothing had happened
luis asks the band to stop the music for a little bit and he takes the microphone
good evening everyone
i want to say something
love came today it came here all pretty
he taps his heart its kind of like a little mouse is crawling inside of me
because thats what love is its like your insides get all twisted into knots
and that baby is what youve taught me
and because youve shown me i want to tell everyone that hopefully love will get inside them too
because it feels so good really
thanks a lot and keep havin a good time
everybody applauds and luis steps down from the dais proud of his speech
he goes to amelia and gives her a very long and loving hug
night has fallen
the music plays full blast
everyone dances people start to make out the drunk collapse
patricia breathes regularly with her hands on her belly
luis drinks beer beside her while he watches the guests dance
debbie falls asleep on amelias lap while mike watches the party overwhelmed
when are my parents getting back
the question catches amelia off guard
they told me they were coming back today
se quedaron mas rato
the answer seem to makes mike anxious
my dads coming back with my mom
yes he is
i dont want him to leave again
he starts crying
i miss pat
amelia embraces him and kisses his head
yo tambien hijito yo tambien
the boy tired and sleepy leans his head on amelia
santiago a little bit drunk and amelia carrying debbie who has passed out say goodbye to luis and patricia
sleepy mike leans on the hood of the car
all in spanish stay the night
i have to take these kids home and its almost dawn
but santiagos pretty drunk
drunk my ass
ill go and come back in an hour

i wish but these kids have to go to school
santiago opens the door for amelia who carefully sets debbie on the back seat
mike gets in and as soon as he does he nestles in to go to sleep
see you soon son
luis and amelia hug each other
then amelia hugs her daughter in law
she points at her belly take care of my grandson cause im dying to be a grandmother
she gives her a kiss and gets in the car
luis turns to santiago
you sure youre not too drunk
drunk my ass
ill be back soon
santiago stumbles to the drivers side and opens the door
the night spreads over the highway that cuts across the desert
santiagos car drives along illuminating the cacti
santiago drives the car nodding off every now and then
in the back debbie and mike have surrendered to sleep
santiago jerks the wheel
in spanish hey
santiago corrects the vehicles trajectory and goes back to his careless driving
santiago decides to cross through mesa de otay
since its nighttime there are very few cars
they drive across the bridge and stop before the immigration officer
the officer walks up to the window
santiago and amelia take out their passports and their green cards
the officer compares the documents to their faces again and again
where you comin from
in bad english from a wedding
the officer looks through the window and sees debbie and mike sleeping in the back
who are they
santiago rushes to answer
theyre her nephews
amelia freezes at santiagos answer
the officer wont stop looking at the children
they dont look like you
bewildered im in charge of them
do you have their passports
amelia takes out their american passports and shows them to the cop
he looks them over very carefully
santiago starts to get nervous
is there a problem
the officer turns to look at them suspiciously
he obviously smells the alcohol
should there be one
santiago shakes his head
debbie wakes up and looks at the officer sleepily
hey there sweetie
debbie rubs her eyes
tell me is this lady your aunty
debbie innocently shakes her head
no shes not my aunty
the officer stares at them harshly
he says something incomprehensible over his radio and asks santiago
are you drunk
get out of the car
im countin to three
he brings his hand to his gun
nervous santiago glances ahead and looks at the border crossing through his rear view mirror
he puts the car in reverse and accelerates trying to escape back to mexico but he crashes into an arriving car
in spanish what are you doing
the immigration officers take out their guns and run to stop him
santiago sees that the road ahead is clear and he drives away full speed barely swerving around some customs officers who are searching another vehicle
the officer shouts urgently
theyve kidnapped some kids
he starts a police chase
santiagos car drives full speed down the highway
he sometimes looks as if he is going to lose control
santiago drives madly
frightened amelia holds onto the dashboard
debbie and mike start to cry
in spanish see i told you you shouldnt have brought them
i told you
i told you
a trailer drives slowly
santiago decides to drive around it blindly and almost drives off the other side of the road
in spanish santiago stop acting crazy and stop the car
santiago ignores her concentrated on his driving
he looks through the rear view mirror
there is nobody behind him only the dark highway
santiago steps on the gas
amelia tries to comfort the kids
in english everythings all right sweeties
the children wont stop crying terrified by the speed
through one of his mirrors santiago sees two patrol cars following him with their turrets flashing
in spanish fucking asshole gringo mother fuckers here they come
the car seems to be out of control
the children scream
amelia tries to stop santiago
in spanish stop
santiago reaches a path and heads toward it
the car drives quickly down the path raising up a cloud of dust
the patrol cars are no longer visible
the car drives on for a mile and then stops
santiago turns to amelia
their entire dialogue in spanish get out
amelia looks at the dark desert surrounding them
are you crazy
ill lose these bastards and then ill come back for you
santiago calm down
aunt amelia theyre going to get us get out god damn it
amelia gets out and opens the door for the kids
in english come with me dears
the kids get out and amelia holds their hand
santiago closes the doors and drives off in a cloud of dust
they start to walk through the darkness
amelia leads the way avoiding cacti and thorny branches
the go on like this for a long stretch
the children are quiet and scared
amelia goes toward the highway and realizes the patrol cars have turned into the path
she runs into the desert with the kids
she can barely see with the light of the early dawn
the three frequently trip on thorny plants
i want to go home now
both of them scared start to cry
in english dont cry
were going home now
she looks back worried at where the patrol cars were they are approaching quickly
then she turns to where santiago ran
the headlights are soon lost on the horizon
amelia holds them by the hand and pulls them as she runs
in spanish lets go
she leads them further and further away from the path snaking through the brush
the patrol cars come even closer
amelia ducks and hides behind one of the bushes
the children hide with her
the patrol cars tear past her some five hundred yards away chasing after santiago
we suddenly hear sirens
then the sound of doors slamming and unintelligible voices over a loudspeaker
do not get out of the car
dont get out
after a few seconds we hear distant gunshots three four
amelia listens frozen
susan sleeps and richard looks at the vast desert through the window
anwar sitting on a chair with a fan clears away the flies hovering around susan
we can hear the call to prayer and anwar prostrates himself toward mecca
richard observes anwars prayer and then looks at susan who moans in her sleep
richard and anwar are sitting in silence while susan lies unconsciously on the floor
yamile a beautiful girl with large brown eyes enters carrying a tray with cookies and tea
she greets richard with a nod and offers him tea
richard takes the tea
the girl gets up to offer tea to anwar who takes it
in arabic thank you yamile
yamile smiles and leaves the room
is that your daughter
the fourth of eight
anwar affirms smiling
do you have kids
richard takes out his wallet and pulls out a photo of him susan mike and debbie
he shows it to him
anwar takes it and looks at it
he remains pensive yes just two

anwar returns the photo
richard looks at it for a moment before putting it back into his wallet
what about you
how many wives do you have
smiling i can only afford one
and is this where you live
no this is where my family lives
i live in marrakesh
but i come whenever i can
they exchange a look
we hear a car engine
an old run down peugeot driven by a policeman pulls up in front of the house
the policeman gets out
the tourists leaning on the wall get up to see whats happening
mohammed comes out to talk to him
in arabic what happened
in arabic i need to talk to the american
tom interrogates mohammed
what did he say
the policeman anwar and richard are chatting in the patio
to anwar when did he find out

in arabic to the policeman he wants you to call another ambulance

he faces the police officer
she cant stay here or shell die

the policeman cannot understand and remains expressionless
come on move

in arabic he asks how were going to get the woman out of here
in arabic tell him that they told me that his embassy is going to deal with it
he says your embassy will deal with the matter
richard now shouts at anwar
how the fuck are they going to deal with it
its your shitty fucking countrys responsibility
in arabic the americans want to send one of their helicopters but i think there are some problems
anwar mulls over his answer
he seems to want to lie again
theyre going to try to send a helicopter
incredulous a helicopter
lets get out of here
he starts walking
anwar catches up to him
richard turns to him desperate
i need to make a phone call
they turn towards the exit leaving the cop behind who doesnt seem to understand
tom and james take advantage of the situation to go talk to richard
we cant stay here any longer
its going to get dark soon
lots of people arent feeling well and its dangerous to stay here
richard explodes and pushes tom
stop fucking with me
dont you dare push me
he pushes him again angrily
what are you doing you stupid fuck
tom shoves him
richard becomes furious and loses it hitting him over and over again
some of the tourists get involved
james manages to grab him with anwar
hey take it easy

james pulls him away while other tourists pull tom away
try to calm down
my wife is dying up there

where the fuck do you want me to take her
try to understand many of them cant go on
tell me honestly is there any point in us staying
richard threatens him
you leave and ill kill you
james is going to say something but richard turns around and walks away as he is about to say something
richard is in the phone booth with telephone in hand
a womans voice answers

richard the news is all over the place
theyre going to go help you soon but there have been some political problems that are being resolved

through the window richard astonished watches the bus drive away kicking up dust as it disappears in the distance
son of a bitch
he throws the phone away and runs after the bus
we hear marks desperate voice over the receiver
richard answer me
richard runs after the bus as it drives away down the side streets
stop you mother fuckers stop
the bus vanishes into the distance
richard picks up a stone and hurls it impotently
chieko is in her room sitting on her bed staring into space
the doorbell light goes on
she remains motionless for a few moments
the light goes on again
chieko breathes in and goes to open the door
chieko opens the door and runs into kenji who greets her as if she were just anybody
they told me you wanted to talk to me
chieko who has been unable to read his lips asks him with her hands that he speak slowly and face her
kenji is embarrassed by his tactlessness and tries to be more considerate
is there something you wanted to tell me
chieko nods and asks him in with her hand
kenji takes off his shoes and leaves them at the door
chieko leads him to the living room and with a gesture asks if he wants anything to drink
do you have tea
chieko nods and goes into the kitchen
kenji glances over the apartment
chieko comes back from the kitchen holding a strange gadget which she puts on the living room table
a small bulb lights
kenji just watches her
chieko gestures for him to sit down
kenji and chieko sit across from each other
chieko takes out her notebook and pen writes something down and hands it over to kenji
kenji reads seems surprised and reads again slowly
my father had nothing to do with my mothers death whats this
chieko is disconcerted at the question
she takes her notebook and starts writing
kenji reads and turns to her
your father was asleep when she jumped off the balcony
she gets up asks kenji to go with her and walks toward the balcony
she opens the door to the balcony and points at the void its over twelve floors
kenji looks over the distance is dizzying
chieko writes in her notebook and shows him the piece of paper
you saw her jump
she nods and writes again
she looks perturbed
youve already told the other officers
she nods again
kenji holds her by her arms
i dont know what youre talking about
chieko remains motionless for a few seconds
she scrawls in her notebook then why do you want to talk to my father
kenji reads and then turns to her
its about a hunting rifle in his name
the red bulb on the gadget starts to blink
chieko spots it from the balcony and signals to kenji that she has to go to the kitchen
she runs off
kenji stands and looks at the photographs of yasujiro hunting all over the world with a kudu in africa a black bear in kamchatka hassan and the oryx in morocco
chieko comes back with a cup of steaming tea
does your father still hunt
she shakes her head
she writes something and hands it over
there was an incident with a rifle in your fathers name
thats why we want to talk to him
the news weighs on chieko she looks away
the sounds of tokyo come in through the living room its car horns its voices
suddenly a rush of wind comes in
chieko sees the balcony doors are open and goes to close them
she then comes back to the living room and sits down dejected
kenji sits down beside her and leaves the tea on the table
he doesnt know what to do and looks uncomfortable
she picks up the notebook and writes
no your father isnt going to jail
we just need to talk to him
there is a long silence
chieko seems immersed in a remote inaccessible world
kenji turns his face to hers so that she can read his lips
i have to go now
chieko grabs his arm and shakes her head urging him to stay
they exchange a look for an instant and kenji insists
i have to go
he gets up to leave
chieko signals for him to wait for a moment and goes to her room
kenji stands in the middle of the room waiting
chieko comes back completely naked
her skin bristles
she walks toward him breathing through her mouth
kenji is disconcerted when he sees the quiet teenager approach
she walks all the way up to kenji and when she is about to take another step he holds her back with both hands
what are you doing
she doesnt pay attention breaks free and stands a few inches away from him
she is almost panting
she holds out her hand and caresses kenjis ear
he stands there immobile without taking his eyes off chiekos
she takes his hand and puts it on one of her breasts
kenji strokes her breast and then pulls his hand away
she grabs it again and puts it back on
no no no
this is wrong
kenji looks turned on and confused chieko is beautiful but he knows he cannot go on and takes his hand away
no i cant
youre just a girl
she walks up to his face and licks it
he is confused
he grabs her by her arms and moves her away
she grabs the sleeve of his jacket and pulls him back
she hugs him and suddenly chieko starts crying disconsolate
kenji bewildered first does nothing but upon seeing chiekos despair holds her
she buries her face in his shoulder
her nakedness becomes increasingly fragile
abdullah afraid watches his son shoot
the police have stopped firing and run for cover
yussef loads the rifle again and aims carefully
he shoots and in the distance we can see one of the headlights on a police truck shatter
abdullah shouts at yussef desperately
yussef stop shooting
furious yussef loads the rifle again and starts shooting at the cops
ahmed wont stop screaming from the pain
confused abdullah doesnt know if he should console his wounded son or stop the enraged yussef
in the distance the cops reorganize
we hear the faraway shots of alarid giving orders
move that truck
god damn it
one of the cops gets onto a truck and uses it as a parapet
yussef aims again but this time the policemen are well covered
abdullah drags himself all the way to yussef
give me that rifle
yussef turns to his father
theyre going to kill us
give me that rifle
he tries to wrest it away but yussef resists
the struggle and abdullah finally pulls it away
when yussef tries to snatch it back the police fire a round of shots and the two barely have time to hide
the air is thick with gunshots
yussef and abdullah terrified stick to the stones
the bullets strike very close to them and they cant even raise their heads
ahmed wont stop complaining
abdullah shouts at him
ahmed dont move
the gunshots rain down for over a minute
when they stop abdullah turns to look at ahmed who is lying motionless on the rocks with bullet in his back
oblivious of the police he gets up and runs toward him
motionless ahmed just moans
with every breath his shirt grows bloodier
he rolls ahmed over and lays his head on his lap
abdullah cannot stop crying
yussef ducking runs toward his brother
abdullah laments nervously
dont die dont die
yussef is shocked upon seeing his dead brother
he stands up and without caring whether anyone fires at him or not he raises the rifle up in the air for the police to see that he is not
aiming and starts to break it against the rocks
when hes finished breaking it he opens his arms and walks toward the police
one of them policemen looks at him through a pair of binoculars
alarid interrogates him
a boy is walking this way
is he armed
the officer takes a careful look
it doesnt look like it
what are the others doing
the officer watches abdullah carrying his wounded son
a man is holding somebody injured
is the other one still walking this way
alarid turns to the other officers
the police aim and hold yussef in their sights
he keeps walking resolutely toward his aggressors
he is crying softly keeping his arms open
yussef walks until his is meters away from the police and he kneels with his arms open
i killed the american i was the only one who shot at you
cautious the police still aim at his chest
yussef proceeds with his confession babbling it through his nerves his pain and his attempt to control his sobbing
they did nothing
he turns to his father and his brother and points at them
kill me but save my brother he did nothing
alarid moves in aiming at him with a rifle
behind him are five other cops also ready to shoot
on the ground
yussef does not obey
save my brother
on the ground
yussef turns his face toward alarid looks him in the eye
save my brother
he lies on the floor crying
alarid puts his gun down and looks at him his enemy is a disconsolate child
then he looks up at abdullah who is screaming his lamentations
he turns to one of his subordinates
go help them
one of the officers goes to help abdullah and ahmed
yussef lies on the floor crying
the sun rises
amelia and the children keep walking
i cant walk anymore
we have to keep walking
why is the air so hot
amelia stops and tries to distract them
the entire dialogue in english because coyotes and snakes and quails have already breathed that air
mike remains pensive
were breathing the same air animals breathe
and it doesnt rot
no it doesnt rot
we all breathe this air
the three walk through the desert
debbie walks mechanically tired and exhausted
i cant anymore
so am i
amelia looks around her no sign of civilization
in spanish just a little further and well go look for water
amelia lumbers heavily carrying debbie asleep on her arm
mike drags his feet a few yards behind
they walk for a long stretch through the thorny brush until they reach a small mound where a leafy mesquite grows
amelia lays a limp debbie down on the ground and sits on the mound of earth
in spanish were going to rest here for a while
what if there are snakes
no there arent any
come lie down
the boy exhausted and docile obeys and lies on her chest
amelia leans against the trunk with debbie on her legs
the children sleep while amelia nodding off tries to keep watch
it is well into the morning
amelia and the children sleep deeply
there is a noise and amelia opens her eyes
she sees a border patrol truck driving around near them
looking through the branches she spies on the truck and watches another one join it
mike awakes and sits up
amelia ducks and lays mike face down
the two trucks slowly approach
to mike in a low voice in spanish stay still
a truck drives by about eighty yards away and then passes
the other one cuts diagonally across its path and then gets lost in the desert
amelia gets up and shakes off the dust
she looks out of place wearing her best clothes torn by the bramble
she makes sure the trucks are leaving
why are we hiding if we didnt do anything wrong
in english because they think we did something wrong
thats not true youre bad
amelia freezes upon hearing the boys words
no sweetie im not bad
i just did something stupid
she pulls him toward her and hugs him tenderly
in spanish i love you very much sweetie
amelia turns and tries to wake debbie
in english debbie weve got to go
the girl opens her eyes but doesnt answer
debbie sweetheart wake up
she closes her eyes again
amelia notices her lips are dry and her breath is irregular she is visibly dehydrated
upon seeing that she doesnt react amelia looks for the trucks theyre far away
amelia carries debbie in her arms under the burning sun following a cattle trail
mike walk behind pale sweaty
amelia looks to the horizon there is no sign of the trucks
they are still walking
amelia can barely go on
she stops to rest
she is sweating copiously
mike also looks weak
the heat is strong and amelia is beaten
she looks for the shade of a cluster of mesquites and lays debbie down
then she turns to mike
sweetie im going to go look for help
stay here and dont move
im not staying here alone
honey you have to take care of debbie
im going with you
mike looks at her with imploring eyes
amelia caresses him
i wont be long
amelia desperately looks through the desert
she also looks dehydrated
amelia drags her feet as she walks
she can go no further
amelia sees a small hillock and climbs it with difficulty
she surveys the environs from the top
in the distance she sees a border patrol truck driving down a path
with great effort amelia runs down the hill
in spanish stop stop
the truck doesnt stop
amelia keeps running flailing her arms and screaming wildly
the truck stops and backs up
amelia keeps going tripping over stones
john a thoroughly mexican officer gets out and she runs up panting to him
please help me
john stares at her suspiciously
i have to go get two kids i left behind in the desert
john looks at her suspiciously
in spanish with a terrible accent are they illegal immigrants
no theyre american
when did you cross
in english i didnt cross i live here

john keeps staring at her
he points to a mesquite
stand there and dont move
john goes back to the vehicle opens the door and sits down and grabs the radio
attention base i have a
i have the suspect
amelia doesnt manage to hear what the radio says
she looks attentively at what the agent is doing
john stops and runs back to her
youre under arrest

i left those kids in the desert i swear
john pushes her forcefully against the truck
turn around now
she turns around with her hands over her head
john handcuffs her and leads her to the vehicle
amelia cuffed and john drive down a path in the desert
which way are they
amelia studies the terrain
she points at some mesquites in the distance
in spanish over there
the truck parks and they both get out
where are they
amelia explores the landscape anguished
they must be around here
another border patrol truck arrives and pulls up next to them
eliseo looks out the window
this lady said they were here but theres nobody
in spanish maam youre not lying to us are you
in spanish i swear theyre around here somewhere
she sees another cluster of mesquites and points toward them
they must be over that way
they arrive at the cluster
the two trucks park and the three get out
she is still cuffed
a helicopter hovers above them
they walk around nothing
theres nobody here
to eliseo in spanish i left them about a kilometer in from the road
in spanish which road
she doesnt know what to say
john grabs her by the arm and drags her toward the vehicle
i dont believe you
amelia looks at him desperately
in english i swear theyre around here
john is not affected
he keeps pulling her
in english john wait maybe shes telling the truth
maybe shes not lets go
please sir believe me
john pays no attention
she turns to eliseo
in spanish i swear theyre lost theyre going to die
i have to find them
john keeps pulling her
he puts her in the truck and closes the door before eliseos passive gaze
in english please no
night begins to fall
from the window we can hear the noises of the town voices goats bleating camels moaning music from a radio
susan wakes from her slumber and turns to richard who is leaning on a wall tired sweaty with his eyes closed
what do you need
if i die take care of the kids
especially mike he really needs you
youre not going to die
you cant die
you just cant

no im not going to leave them and dont you even think about leaving me because ill kill you like nobodys killed you before
he caresses her
i peed my pants
i couldnt hold it in and i peed
richard touches between her legs and feels the moisture
im going to tell mike on you so you never scold him again
they both laugh
she grimaces in pain when she does
i need to pee again
to anwar do you have a pot i can borrow
anwar looks in a corner and hands it over
to anwar can you leave us alone for a moment
the grandmother and anwar exit

he lifts up her dress pulls down her underpants and sets the basin under her
she puts her arm around him to pull herself up but cant move her right arm
he kisses her
we start to hear the stream
now i can
while she pees they kiss painfully
she starts to cry
forgive me my love
when pat died i didnt know what to do the pain drove me crazy
i was scared thats why i left
i was scared too
when i saw pat lying still in his crib
her voice breaks up and she can barely go on
it wasnt my fault it wasnt
i couldnt do anything for him
no it wasnt your fault
i was wrong
he strokes her head
it wasnt your fault my love it wasnt anybodys fault
pat just left
a beat forgive me please
forgive me for not forgiving you
richard hugs her and starts to laugh
you missed you got my leg
they both laugh and as they do the blanket covering susans wound slips off
richard sees her swollen bruised arm
he touches it
does it hurt
richard looks worried and leaves the room
he walks out onto the stairs and calls anwar
anwar runs into the room
weve got to get her out of here
wheres the clinic
in alnif an hour and a half away from here
can you get us a car we can take her in
anwar remains pensive for a moment and then nods
richard is squatting next to susan
im going to get you out of here
were going to try to take you to a clinic an hour and a half away from here
do you think you can make it
she thinks for a moment and then nods
i need you to be strong
susan sighs the effort required seems as if it will be too much but she nods again
richard hugs and kisses her
richard and the vet carry susan out on a wheelbarrow
it is very difficult to move her
she is clearly in pain and groans quietly
outside the house is the policeman with his peugeot
anwar is talking to him
richard and the vet carry susan all the way to the car
richard stands before the policeman he humiliated earlier
thank you for lending us the car
in arabic he thanks you for lending us the car
the policeman nods kindly
dozens of girls and boys and a few adults stare at the scene
gingerly richard anwar and the vet lift her into the car and softly lay her on the back seat
even so she screams in pain
richard holds her hand and squeezes it
sweetie youve got to hold on
richard gets into the car and as theyre about to drive off the shopkeeper runs up to them
in arabic stop
the shopkeeper catches up to them
in arabic theyre calling from the american embassy
richard walks into the cubicle
the phone is off the hook and richard answers
just a moment im going to put you through to ambassador ken clifford
in the corner of the room he sees a goats head covered with flies
hello richard jones
im very sorry about what happened to your wife but you can be sure that the culprits will be punished
my wife is dying
shes in urgent need of medical attention
were working on it
richard interrupts angrily
weve been here for five hours
what the fuck are you waiting for
the moroccan government wont let us use their airspace
they refused to acknowledge that this was an act of terrorism
i cant wait anymore
im taking my wife to a clinic in tinerhir right now
weve settled the matter
a helicopter should arrive soon
we cant wait any longer
the helicopter is on its way
my wife is in critical condition
how long is the chopper going to take

amelia sits in a room painted white
an american his hair slicked back dressed in a shirt and tie sits before her
in spanish is your full name amelia gloria jordan susilla
in spanish yes sir
do you understand english
in english yes sir
in english maam it was a miracle that we found those kids
i dont know how you could leave them alone in the desert
i had to look for help
your reckless behavior endangered their lives
amelia stops arguing
she looks worried
how are they
thats none of your business maam
the mans words hurt amelia who looks away to avoid crying
youve committed serious crimes
i just took the kids to my sons wedding
no maam you did not just do that
you took them to another country without their parents permission and you put them in danger
sir i raised these kids since they were born
i take care of them day and night
i feed them breakfast lunch and dinner
i play with them
mike and debbie are like my own children
sternly but they are not your kids maam
what about my nephew santiago
i dont have any information on him
amelia looks destitute
we located the parents in morocco
theyre very angry but theyve decided not to raise charges
amelia exhales relieved
the policeman leans toward her
nevertheless the government of the united states has deemed you were seriously breaking the law and has decided to immediately and definitively deport you
amelia loses her breath
ive been living here for fifteen years
my things are here i rent a house i made my life here
you shouldve thought of that beforehand
i want to talk to a lawyer
if you attempt to take this to court i assure you you will end up in jail
if you want my advice accept the deportation and never come back
a bus parks in front of the border
several border patrol agents have formed a wall for the illegal immigrants to pass directly through
the illegal immigrants get out and walk toward mexico
as amelia crosses she keeps looking back
the illegal immigrants cross into mexico where they disband into small groups
amelia walks alone
before she walks away she turns to one of the other deported mexicans
in spanish do you have a cigarette
he rummages through his pant pockets and pulls out a pack of cigarettes
he offers one to amelia who takes it
he also pulls out some matches and lights one
amelia smokes drifting
after a while she sits on a sidewalk and leans on a post
she looks into the street at the people passing by and starts crying softly
a dusty and battered pick up truck arrives
inside are her son and her comadre
her son steps down and hugs her in silence as she cries
her comadre observes them from a distance
the truck is parked in front of anwars house
richard and susan wait in the back while the boy anwar and the vet lean on the hood
suddenly a helicopter with american insignia flies over them and goes to land in an empty lot
anwar looks up and watches the helicopter descend
the helicopter kicks up a cloud of dust before the stunned gaze of dozens of children
some camels are frightened
some starving dogs bark at it
they carry susan to the helicopter in a stretcher
they load her in carefully
richard follows her through the wind generated by the helicopter
anwar catches up to them to say goodbye
good luck mister
thank you for everything
richard gives anwar a hug which he responds to affectionately
richard takes out his wallet and holds out three hundred dollar bills which anwar rejects
no sir no
allah be with you
they look each other in the eye and then richard gets into the chopper
it takes off
the helicopter silently flies over the moroccan desert
the hospitals perimeter is guarded by dozens of soldiers
the security is impressive
a group of doctors and nurses with a stretcher wait in the parking lot
several journalists and cameras observe
ken and his entourage await the helicopters landing
the helicopter approaches
the cameramen hurry to position themselves for a better shot
a reporter speaks to the camera
in this helicopter is susan jones an american mother of two who was seriously injured in a terrorist attack
it appears fundamentalist organizations planned the attack
the helicopter settles softly in the parking lot
it is immediately surrounded by several moroccan soldiers
the doctors on the ground prepare the stretcher
ken walks hurriedly toward the chopper guarding himself from the wind
susan is immediately placed on the stretcher and quickly taken to the emergency room
richard follows close behind until his is intercepted by ken
jones im ken clifford ambassador to the united states
richard keeps running behind the stretcher
ken stops him
a first rate medical team is going to tend to her but if you want we can take her to a hospital in italy as soon as shes stable
there are lots of reporters waiting
is there anything you want to say to the press
a statement against terrorism
richard looks at him as if he doesnt know what hes talking about
the last thing im worried about right now is the fucking press
he pulls away from ken and follows susan toward the e
several moroccan doctors are examining susan
richard observes worriedly from a window
one of the doctors comes out
in good english were going to have to operate immediately
is she going to be ok
were going to try to save her arm
shes been bleeding internally and theres been some clotting so theres a high risk of gangrene
insistently as if he hadnt heard the doctor but shes going to be ok
the moroccan doctor puts his hand on richards shoulder and thinks about his answer
yes shes going to be ok
the doctor leaves and richard goes back to looking at his wife through the glass
the doctors are still prepping her
richard walks in
he stands next to susan who is unconscious
he looks at a doctor and she moves to one side
richard leans over and kisses her
he walks away and the nurses start to wheel her to the o
richard is talking on the phone from an office
how is everything
ok sir mrs
rachel told me
im very sorry
how is mrs
theyre going to operate now
take good care of the kids and dont tell them anything
no sir dont worry

a few seconds pass and mike answers
this is the phone call from the beginning
hey sweetie how are you
dad guess what
today at school they brought some baby chickens
i held one in my hand
he was really little and he was all warm
richard starts to cry for the first time
dad are you ok
richard tries to hold back his sobbing
yeah im ok
the boy keeps talking while richard cries
and mariana wanted to take one home but the teacher didnt let her
chieko naked sits in an armchair again submerged in the remote world of her silence
before her kenji observes her nakedness her sadness her pained beauty
for a while they remain motionless
she seems to return from the long journey to herself and turns to look at him
their eyes meet
there are still tears in chiekos eyes
they hold each others gaze until chieko gets up gets her notebook scribbles down some words and gives them to him
kenji reads them and looks at her
you dont have to apologize for anything
she sits down beside him
they look at each other again for a few long seconds
chieko takes his hand strokes it for a moment kisses it sucks one of his fingers and then puts it back in its place
she grabs her notebook and starts writing a long note
it takes her almost a minute to do so
kenji nervous because of her proximity watches her write feverishly
chieko finishes writing folds the note and hands it to kenji
kenji starts unfolding it but chieko stops him
she takes it away from him folds it again and puts it in his breast pocket
she signals for him to read it later
kenji gets up to go
she stands next to him
her nakedness contrasts with kenjis toughness
he bows his head to say goodbye and she moves aside for him to pass
kenji walks past her as she watches
kenji reaches the door
he opens it and turns to look at chieko again who has been left in the middle of the hall
he bows his head again and leaves
chieko watches him leave and closes her eyes painfully
kenji rides the elevator down touched barely able to contain his emotion
the elevator doors open and he walks out
kenji walks past the doorman
he keeps walking
on the other end of the lobby at the parking lot entrance yasujiro walks in
the doorman calls kenji as he is about to leave
beside him is yasujiro
this is the man you were looking for
kenji approaches him while the doorman discretely moves away to leave them alone in the lobby
good evening im lieutenant mamiya
good evening how can i help you
sir there was an incident and
yasujiro looks at him attentively
kenji still moved by chieko looks distracted confused
i dont mean to bother you but
a beat do you own a
caliber winchester rifle with the registration number
kenji looks through his pockets takes out a small notebook and looks up the missing number
i dont remember the license but i did have a rifle like the one you described
is it true that you gave it to a mr
hassan ibrahim who lives in southern morocco
he says he was your guide in a hunt
he was a very good guide and i gave him the rifle
hassan is a very kind man
did anything happen
there was an attempted murder with that rifle and the moroccan police want to confirm its not off the black market
no i gave it to him
a beat is hassan ok
i dont know
yasujiro remains silent for a moment
am i legally involved
not for the moment
you may have to go testify for your friend
can i leave now
they both bow to say goodbye
yasujiro walks toward the elevator
kenji calls out to him
kenji approaches and yasujiro awaits expectant
your daughter told me about your wife on the balcony
im very sorry
about how your wife killed herself by jumping off the balcony
my wife never jumped off a balcony
she shot herself in the head
my daughter was the first to find her
kenji is left speechless
ive explained it to the police several times
dont bother us with that anymore please
im very sorry sir we wont bother you anymore
he turns around and leaves the building
kenji walks down the streets immersed in his thoughts
kenji sits in a half empty bar
he turns to the bartender
has been turned on to a japanese newscast
kenji takes out chiekos note reads it and as soon as he is done closes his eyes
he looks around
everybody seems to be immersed in a world far from his own
a reporter appears on t
susan jones the american woman wounded in an attack in morocco ten days ago left the hospital today heading to the united states
susan appears on screen in a wheelchair pushed by a male nurse and followed by richard
the bartender leans over to kenji
do you want something to eat
i could make you a sandwich
no thank you
when he looks back at the news the story has changed
kenji drinks his whisky parsimoniously
yasujiro rides the elevator up lost in thought
from the balcony naked chieko observes the city stretching before her
yasujiro walks in and encounters his daughter completely naked
there are still traces of chiekos tears in her eyes
yasujiro is affected when he sees his daughter like this but says nothing
he slowly walks toward her
chieko looks hurt but whole
yasujiro stands beside her
they look at each other
chieko holds out her hand and takes his
she looks at the city and then looks at her fathers eyes
he strokes her hair and they both stand on the balcony with the massive city sprawling under them
