written by john hodge a blurred image forms on a white screen
a horizontal strip of face eyes motionless and unblinking
take trust for instance or friendship these are the important things in life the things that matter that help you on your way
if you cant trust your friends well what then
a series of fast cut static scenes of empty streets
this could have been any city theyre all the same
a rapid swerving track along deserted streets and down narrow lanes and passageways
accompanied by soundtrack and credits
the track ends outside a solid fashionable edinburgh tenement
at the door of a flat on the third floor of the tenement
the door is dark heavy wood and on it is a plastic card embossed with the names of three tenants
they are alex law david stevens and juliet miller
a man climbs the stairs and reaches the door
he is cameron clarke thin and in his late twenties with a blue anorak and lank greasy hair
he is carrying an awkwardly bulky plastic bag
cameron gives the doorbell an ineffectual ring and then stands back shifting nervously from foot to foot until the door is answered
hello ive come about the room
cameron enters and the door closes
david alex and juliet sit in a line on the sofa directly opposite cameron who shifts uneasily in his armchair
alex checks some items on a clipboard before speaking
whats his name
i dont know campbell or something
to juliet really
to cameron what
cameron is not sure what to say
well cameron are you comfortable
well youve seen the flat
and you like it
oh yes its great
it is isnt it
we alllike it
and the rooms nice too dont you think
spacious quiet bright well appointed all that sort of stuff all that crap
so tell me cameron what on earth just tell me because i want to know what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat
like this with someone like you
as cameron plods slowly down the stairs his shoes striking out against the stone steps alexs criticisms continue
i mean my first impression and theyre rarely wrong is that you have none of the qualities that we would normally seek in a prospective flatmate
im talking here about things like presence charisma style and charm and i dont think were being unreasonable
take david here for instance a chartered accountant he may be but at least he tries hard
the point is i dont think youre even trying
cameron has reached the bottom of the stairs
he opens the main door
and cameron i mean this good luck
cameron leaves and the main door closes behind him
do you think he was upset
inside the hall of the flat david approaches the door toopen it
david likes to keep spareshoelaces in sorted pairs in a box marked not just shoelaces but spare shoelaces
david opens the door to the woman
ive come to see about the room
outside the door of the flat a young goth girl aged about twenty rings the doorbell
inside the hall of the flat alex approaches the door to open it
alex is a vegetarian
do you know why
because he feels it provides an interesting counterpoint to his otherwise callous personality
he thinks hes the man for me
he isnt though there was a time when well there was a time when
alex opens the door to the goth
ive come about the room
at the door of the flat a man aged about thrity five rings the bell
inside the hall of the flat juliet approaches the door to open it
like one of those stupid posters you know a gorilla cuddling a hedgehog caption love hurts thats what i think when i think of juliet
juliet opens the door to the man
ive come about the room
in the living room each of the candidates is interviewed individually with the same seating arrangements as before i
the trio on the sofa and the applicant on the chair
what we see are briskly intercut excerpts from each of these interviews
we do not get the responses to the questions although we may see some facial reaction
all of davids questions are to the woman
all of alexs questions are to the goth
all of juliets questions are to the man
all right just a few questions
id like to ask you about your hobbies
why do you want a room here
do you smoke
when you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands do you then summon hellfire
i mean what are you actually doing here
what is the hidden agenda
do a little freebasemaybe from time to time
or maybe just phone out for a pizza
look its a fairly straightforward question
youre either divorced or youre not
ok im going to play you just a few seconds of this tape id like you to name the song the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded
by him with another band
when you get up in the morning how do you decide what shade of black to wear
now let me get this straight
this affair that youre not having is it not with a man or not with a woman
turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance no this is important
leveraged buy outs a good thing or a bad thing
with which of the following figures do you most closely identify joan of arc eva braun or marilyn monroe
its just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is quite simply just
did you ever kill a man
and when did anyone last say to you these exact words you are the sunshine of my life
ok so a has left you b is ambivalent youre still seeing c but d is the one you yearn for
what are we to make of this
if i were you id ditch the lot
theres a lot more letters in the alphabet of love
and what if i told you that i was the antichrist
in a sports centre juliet sits outside a glass walled squash court
she is ready to play but at present is watching alex and david who are inside the court
inside the squash court alex is about to serve
squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination
i was trying to educate you
in the same fashion as chess
chess is often used as well
will you shut up and play
youre a bad loser
i havent lost yet
the squash court door opens and david walks out past juliet as alex stands behind jabbing his finger at him
defeat defeat defeat sporting personal financial professional sexual everything
juliet walks in and closes the door
inside the squash court alex is about to serve
did you know just serve
alex sits in the back drinking
juliet is driving
david sits beside her
i wasnt trying to win
there is no response from juliet
i dont want to devalue your victory but i just want you to know i wasnt trying to win
victory is the same as defeat
its giving in to destructive competitive urges
you learn that in your psychotherapy group
discussion group alex discussion
i thought you stopped going
yeah he had one too many of thise urges
you of all people should know that
alex leans close to juliet
juliet brakes abruptly and as alex flies forward elbows him in the chest
god you two are sensitive
all im doing is implying some sort of sordid ugly sexual liason
why id be proud of that sort of thing
maybe you should go alex
youll meet someone wonderful
for my life
at a discussion group
i think not
for the flat
be someone else like him
one is enough
and what happened to that girl that friend of yours the one that came round
i liked her
i really felt we had something
she could have moved in
we had chemistry
she hated you well she had problems more than anyone she has ever met
in her whole life
id be the first topoint that out
in all kindness i would
but like they say you know shes got to want to change hasnt she
outside the door of the flat hugo rings the bell and waits
juliet opens the door
hugo is in his early thirties tall dark and bohemian in appearance
you must be hugo
you must be juliet
would you like to come in
id be delighted
hugo walks in and juliet closes the door quite deliberately behind him
hugo looks around pleased at what he sees while juliet watches him
he sits on the edge of the bed
would you like to see the rest
hugo is seated on the sofa juliet sits opposite on an armchair
what do you do
well ive been away for a bit travelling that sort of thing and now im trying to write a novel
whats it about
a priest who dies
well maybe ill change it
yes i mean who wants to read about another dead priest
its about some other guy some guy whos not a priest who doesnt die
you see its better already
writing seems easy
its a breeze
the telephone begins to ring out in the hall
juliet does not move and at first says nothing
hugo looks at her and towards the door leading to the hall
after several rings juliet speaks
do you think you could answer that
it continues to ring
yes the telephone but if its for me im not in
youre not in
hugo stands up
the ringing continues
hugo lifts the phone
he turns to face juliet and looks her in the eye as he lies on her behalf
whos calling please
well im sorry but shes not in right now
i dont know
would you like to leave a message
hugo replaces the receiver
it was some guy called brian
did he sound upset
a little bit
is that good or bad
its an improvement
the telephone begins to ring again
shall i answer it
no just leave it
he knows i must be at home
im working nights this week
the telephone continues to ring
im a doctor
and hes a patient of yours
but he needs treatment
a certain weakness
the human condition
you know about it
i write about it
and thats not the same thing
no but like all novelists im in search of the self
juliet dressed and fatigued sits at the table sipping a coffee
alex is also seated at the table but wearing an old dressing gown and munching at cornflakes while he reads a newspaper and talks at the same time
an array of other papers is spread over the table
has he tried down the back of the fridge
i mean thats where i normally find things
he seemed like a nice guy alex
juliet gets up and leaves the kitchen
the soundof a bath running is heard
im not saying he didnt seem like a nice guy
all im saying is its a bit strange and this search for the self and what hes on about you know
alex hears the mail falling through the door and stands up to leave the kitchen and get it
calling from outside he didnt seem strange alex
he seemed you know juliet watches the bath fill
alex considers her reply
alex is walking through the hall to the door muttering interesting to himself
as he passes the phone starts to ring
he stops and lifts it
no shes not in
alex replaces the reciever and walks on to the door
from the bathroom who was it
i dont know
he sounded swedish
do you know any swedish men
maybe it was just the emotion
alex picks up the mail and looks through it
as he does so david emerges from his room dressed for work
what do you think
about this guy this hugo person
i dont have time
im only asking what you think
i dont have time to discuss it now
i dont care so long as hes not a freak
david opens the door
alex hands him an envelope
this is for you
its your mothers handwriting so i didnt open it
i dont like reading about your fathers constipation
david snatches the letter and leaves closing the door
alex walks back across the hall opening one of the letters and reading it quickly
calling from the bathroom so well meet him then
oh yeah sure if you want
i tell you every letter this guy writes to you is the same they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography
i dream of your thighs the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire while i aroused and inflamed juliets hand and arm appear around the bathroom door
she attempts to grab the letter
alex plays at holding the letter just beyond her reach
aroused and inflamed
he even signs them in his own name can you believe it
id sign someone elses name
id sign his name
if i wrote them that is
which i dont
alex david juliet and hugo sit round a table towards the end of a meal
alcohol has been consumed
bowls containing the last of the food sit on the table being picked at occassionally
alex dispenses wine mainly into his own glass alternating with macallan malt whisky of which he pours generous amounts
yeah well thats what she said
thats why youre here you see
normally i dont meet people unless i know them already
people can be so cruel
you were going to say something
what was i trying to say
oh yes i think we think or at least i suppose we think am i right
just get on with it alex
keep it going alex
youre unstoppable now
we think its fine
alex starts eating again
the others watch him expectantly
theres no problem
you mean i can have the room
well thats what i said isnt it
he made it clear
why thank you david
yes you can have the room
alex pours yet more alcohol
im not usually drunk
not usually this drunk
only on expenses
a newspaper is paying for all this
with exaggerated scorn alex knocks over a glass of wine
in a moment hes going to tell he could have been someone it was you juliet it was you instead of what he is what i am
which is which is a hack
the man we know and love
a miserable burnt out empty shell of a alex pauses looks at his drink then at juliet
know and love
i think youre lying
you see they dont really know me
no alex we dont really love you
alex smiles at juliet and drinks again
can you afford this place
hugo reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick bundle of notes which he places in front of alex
alex leans over and sniffs the notes
can i ask you a question
have you ever killed a man
well thats fair enough then
alex raises his head
certainly smells like the real thing
at a cash dispenser a man in his thrities is taking out some money
a younger man andy stands besdie him looking around in a mildly agitated fashion
as the money emerges andy assaults and robs the man
he starts by smashinf the victims face repeatedly against the cash dispenser until the perspex is smeared with blood
when he has final finished and the man lies on the ground andy takes the money and the card from the slots then gets into a car which has pulled
up alongside driven by tim
hugo climbs the stairs carrying two suitcases
he stops at the door of the flat and looks at a bunch of keys before selecting one which he inserts in the door
inside the flat
the door opens and hugolifts his cases in kicking the door closed behind him
juliet sleeps undisturbed by the closing of the door
hugo walks across the halland disappears into his room
hugo unpackshis bags
included in his things are a few syringes and needles
all these he puts into the drawer beside his bed
he checks inside a second bag
hugo dails a number on the telephone and awaits a reply
juliet is woken by her alarm clock
the time is five p
alex sits watching television constantly changing channels
juliet walks in wearing a dressing gown
she watches alex for a few moments
have you seen hugo
any idea which channel hes on
the telephone is ringing
alex lifts up the reciever
again he is wearing his dressing gown and is on his way to pick up the mail
no shes not in
without waiting for any more he replaces the reciever and walks to the door where he picks up the mail
on his way back from the door david emerges ready to go to work
have you seen him
alex i dont have the time yes or no yes or no yes or no
david leaves slamming the door
alex returns to the kitchen pausing only to knock at hugos door which elicits no response
in the kitchen juliet sits dressed for work having just returned
he casually opens an envelope and glances at both sides of the letter before handing it to her
david hasnt seen him either
so i gathered
maybe he didnt like us
his cars still there
hes got a car
so whats wrong with that
what sort of car
alex how shouldi know
im just a girl
i will ask you once more what sort of car a blue one ok
and its still there
we see the door to hugos room then alex rapping sharply against it
david and juliet stand behind him
sorry about this but can you open the door
its us hugo your flatmates and companions
your new found friends
hes not in
hes left and well probably never see him again
alex the key is in the keyhole on the other side
you want me to kick it open
after several ineffective kicks at the door alex turns to david
you want a go
inside hugos room we see the door as david outside throws himself against it
at the third attempt the lock gives way and the door bursts open
in the foreground at one side is the bed with a naked foot lying still and exposed
when the door is open david is first in followed by the other two
there is a period of silent shock as they contemplate hugos naked corpse
alex opens a window
is this what they always look like
juliet drapes a sheet over the body covering it completely
i wonder how he did it
i wonder how he killed himself
i presume that thats what happened
what do you think
quite casually alex begins to open drawers and cupboards emptying the contents on to the floor
what are you doing
im just looking
whats wrong juliet
arent you curious
dont you wonder what he died from
the guys dead
what more do you need
its not every day i find a story in my own flat
thats not a story alex
its a corpse
old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story
be rational please and failing that be quiet
in a drawer in a bedside cabinet alex finds needles syringes and a small bag of powder
without comment he holds it up and throws it on the bed
he reaches under the bed and pulls out a case which he opens
it is empty and he pushes it back under
ive never seen a dead body before
alex i think its time for you to stop
alex continues to search
juliet walks out
juliet stands alone
alex continues his brisk search through hugos posesseions while david looks on appalled but speechless
juliet listens to the sounds from the bedroom then picks up the telephone
she dials and waits for a reply
it rings and rings
alex has found and opened a large gladstone bag
neither david norwe can see into it
i saw my grandmother of course but i dont suppose that counts
i mean she was alive at the time
can i show you something
juliet awaits an answer
alex approaches juliet with the open bag
she turns around and looks into it then seeing the contents she replaces the receiver
as she does so the operators voice is audible for a second
hello emergency services
the telephone hits the cradle
david alex and juliet are seated in silence around the tabel
the bag stacked with money lies open on the table
think about it
come on david
its its what
is that all
you mean immoral
im only asking you both to think about it
its asick idea alex
but dont tell me that youre not tempted by it
dont tell me that youre not interested
i know you well enough
you think so
all right then go ahead telephone
telephone the police
no ones going to stand in your way
tell them theres a suitcase of money and you dont want it
the flat is silent
footsteps are heard outside the door and mail falls through the letter box
the living room empty
the kitchen empty
the bag of money still sits on the table
his corpse lies on the bed covered as before incompletely by a sheet with parts of his body still showing a foot a hand part of his face or abdomen
the open plan office of a busy newspaper
alex sits at his desk
he is talking on a telephone jammed against his shoulder and while he does so he is casually acknowledging and waving at colleagues
now was there a pet in the house
yes a pet like a dog or a budgie or a gerbil
you see what i need is pc plod rescues harry the hamster from house of horror
well thats a pity you see no pets no human angle
alex hangs up
another view of the body for example from above
in the accident and emeregency department of a busy hospital juliet sifts through a setof casenotes
another doctor approaches her
juliet does not look up
what happened to that guy
that guy the one that died
juliet looks up
what guy that died
that one last week
yeah here i mean where else
well he died
thats what i thought
the body stillpresent exposed and motionless
the curtain flutters by the open window
lumsden a middle aged chartered accountant isseated in a largechair behind a desk
he is talking to david who appears distracted
what do we do here david
in this firm
well its a wide range of eh accounting david chartered accounting exactly what i was is often sneered at
are you aware of that
not any real sneering as such no
theres a whole wide world out there and it all needs to be accounted for doesnt it
eh but they sneer dont they
im not sure oh its unfashionable i know but yes were methodical yes were dilligent yes were serious and wheres the crime in that and why not shout it from
the rooftops yes maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring but by god we get the job done
and thats why i think you fit in here
you get the job done
oh i see i thought you meant which is why im trusting you with this account
lumsden throws a heavy folder into davids lap
it is almost dark
only the familiar contour is visible through the gloom
david ascends the stairs to the flat
alex sits in an armchair facing out of the window
juliet stands facing into the room
david the last home appears in the doorway
hes still here
he couldnt get his car started
when are you going to let the police know
you call them if you want
to juliet and what about you
well im getting used to having him around
the corpse as before
david sits at his desk looking across the office
crouched over a large array of other desks young men and women in suits are pouring over folders and columned books
no one is speaking except in muted tones on the telephones
david watches them
he looks to his left and to his right on either side young men like him are toiling over accounts
he turns and looks behind him where another array of accountants sit
he turns back to his desk and opens the file he was previously given
he looks at the columns of records of profit with a large total at the bottom
when david looks up he sees juliet seated beside his desk
she smiles and directs his gaze with her own to the surrounding scene
the body in silhouette
lets do it
inside a large brightly lit diy store with muzak playing in the background
we start with a tracking shot along an aisle stacked with potentially vicious tools
all right now listen
we have to dispose of the body in such a way as to make it unidentifiable so that even if it is found then its never anything more than an
burning dumping at sea and straightforward burial are all flawed either by fingerprints or more commonly by dental records
this i have learned
now what i suggest is that we bury him out in the forest but first of all we remove his hands and his feet which we incinerate
and his teeth which we just remove
its as simple as that
as the tracking shot ends we see davids head and shoulders as he looks at something off picture
suddenly a spring loaded screwdriver appears and is fired so that the tip stops a few millimeters from his face
david winces as we see that alex is holding it
i always wondered what these were for
alex places the screwdriver down on the shelf and walks across the aisle to pick up a saw and a hammer
now this is what we need
alex hands the tools to david who looks at them with disgust
alex walks on
now what else
i dont know
a spade we need a spade i wish you would concentrate we need a spade if were going to dig a pit
so whos going to do it
dig the pit i dont know
no not that
whos going to do what
you know what im talking about
what are you talking about
you know what
whos going to do it
we all are david were all going to do it
each of us you me and juliet will do his or her bit
is that fair enough
i cant do it
i dont hear this
i wont be able to
youre telling me you want out
youre telling me you dont want the money
hugo is going off
the flat smells
we cant wait any longer
im just telling you i cant cut him up
alex turns away in disgust
late at night in a quiet lane at the back of the flat a hired ford transit is parked
inside the dimly lit van alex and juliet are laying down plastic on the floor
whos going to do it
i thought we all were
i dont thinki can
but youre a doctor
you kill people every day
i dont want to
and now you tell me
a mans face is being held under water
bubbles escape from his mouth and his eys bulge
tim hauls the mans head out of the bath
his legs and arms are bound with cord
andy sits on a chair watching
tim ducks the mans head under the water again
the mans face as before
we see hugos face just before alex david and juliet wrap him in a sheet and thick black plastic
they wear masks over their noses
the smell is making them uncomfortable and irritable
theres something i want to ask
the mans head has just been lifted from the water
i dont know
i swear to god i dont know
tim ducks the mans head back under the water
angry through his mask family
drugged up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck ups dont have families david
i just thought we should discuss it
take his legs
in the stairwell of the flat grunts of effort are heard as alex david and juliet struggle with the heavy corpse carrying it down the stairs wrapped in plastic sheeting
they come into view and go down the stairs
they are all very tense and freeze with panic after accidentally banging against another flats door
they swear at one another and continue theri descent
tim is ducking the man again
he writhes and struggles but is powerless to stop it
the back yard and back door of the flats
the door opens and alex david and juliet emerge carrying the corpse out towards the van
from the landing we can see along the floor into the bathroom
the mans legs extend away from the bath
they are completely still
andy and tim stand beside them looking down
you stupid bastard
inside the back of the empty van
the door is opened and the body is half slid and half thrown inside
the door is closed and in the dark interior the outline of the plastic lump is just visible thanks to a streetlight
one of the doors opens again and david throws a bag of tools in
he then closes and locks the door
in front of the van david is climbing into the passenger side
juliet and alex are already in with the latter at the wheel
alex turns to the other two
why dont we just draw lots for it
the other two remain silent
whoever draws the short straw does it all
that way you either do it or you dont
all or nothing
i dont know
look if i draw the short straw then ill do it but im not going to do it just because you wont
alex starts the engine of the van
through the darkness we hear an engine then the headlights of the van come into view
it pulls off the track onto a patch of grass
the engine is switched off but the light remains on
the trio descend from the van
in fron of the van alex illuminated by its lights alex david and juliet stand together
alex is showing them two long stems of grass and one short one
he encloses them in his fist and holds them out
all right then here we are and this is it
do you want to play or not
alex holds his hand out towards juliet who takes the tip of one of the stems
it is one of the larger ones
alex and juliet turn to david
alex holds out the stems
david reaches out and takes one of the tips
it is the short straw
i cant do it
deeper in the forest with the headlamps still casting a little light throught the trees we see davids head and shoulders
his right arm is moving briskly back and forth accompanied by a vicious sawing noise
the sawing stops as he evidently finished with one extremity
he shuffles back and starts sawing at another
alex leans against the spade in a shallow pit that he has dug
he observes david impassively
the sawing stops again
but not quite
is that going to be deep enough
alex bends down to pick up the hammer which he holds out towards david
dont you worry about that
is this necessary
now come on all or nothing
most reluctantly david takes the hammer and looks at alex who gestures as if to say on you go
with revulsion on his face he raises the hammer above his head
davids face is visible against the plain white backdrop of his pillow
he lies fully clothed on his bed looking up at the ceiling
there is a knock at the door then juliet walks in
are you all right
without looking at juliet oh yes im fine thanks just fine
would you like to talk about it
alex sits with his feet up watching a noisy game show while eating a snack and drinking from a can of beer
newspapers lie scattered at his feet
the loft above the flat in darkness but the trapdoor is opened letting in a pool of light
david is pulling himself through the trapdoor up into the loft
beneath him is a stepladder
juliet stands half way up the ladder while alex stands on the floor beside it
as david enters the loft alex hands up the bag of money to juliet who passes it on up to david
yeah we dont want another stiff on our hands
dont fall through the ceiling
is he listening to me
to himself i dont know why we couldnt stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being
we could have hid it in the fridge
david moves on into the dark cavernous loft edging his way across beams and pipes
there are no skylights
he stops and leans against some structure the water tank
he strains to see in the darkness
suddenly there is a loud sucking and flowing noise as water empties from the water tank
david is startled and steps forward tripping
he reaches out as he falls striking a light switch
briefly the loft is illuminated david blinking as he lies across some beams the large cavernous area the pipes the water tank the bag of money lying between two rafters
and then the old brass switches beginning to spark and the light goes out
david scrambles towards the trapdoor
now clean and empty with no trace of recent habitation
in a basement corridor in the hospital pipes run along the ceiling
above a fenced off area is a sign saying for incineration only no aerosols
on the floor of this area are yellow plastic sacks
juliet appears around a corner carrying one of these
quite casually the clumps it on the pile and continues past
alex pushes a blue car into a quary
in the garage there is a car gardening equipment several sacks of fertilizer and a trunk style deep freeze on the lid of which sit andy and tim
tim takes out a cigarette and offers one to andy who declines
they slide off the deep freeze and open it
inside the freezer there is a man naked and bound with cord
they lift him up
he is very cold and weak
the man begins to whisper inaudibly
andy moves his head so that he can hear the whisper
he listens then nods approvingly
they push him down again and close the lid
andy holds the lid while tim dumps the sacks of fertilizer on top
alex david and juliet are attending a charity ball
everyone is dressed very smartly in ball gowns and black ties with the addition of a significant number of kilts
neither alex nor david wears a kilt
the trio seem to know a number of people there but do not seem especially keen to speak to them
a middle aged podgy mustachioed master of ceremonies is standing on a platform in front of the band making a speech to the diners who are still sat at their
ladies and gentlemen may i have your attention please
first of all may i thank you all for coming along tonight and supporting our appeal to raise funds for the sick childrens unit
there is a quick drum roll and applause breaks out
we move to the table where alex david and juliet are seated
alex leans across to juliet
you didnt tell me that this was for children
i hate children
id raise money to have the little fuckers put down
some other guests around the table cast critical glances at alex
i want my money back
alex signals to the waiter by lifting his hand and snapping his fingers then indicates another bottle of champagne that already ists in front of him
for all too often theres a complacency out of sight out of mind let someone else bother about these things
alex cheers once and starts to applaud on his own
juliet nudges him viciously
but just before the dancing id like to say a special thank you to a few of the people whove worked so very hard to make this occassion happen
the mcs drone continues in the background while conversation continues back at the table
do you know many of these people
theyre my friends
i see so if they want to talk to you we say youre not in
and now ladies and gentlemen and those of you who are neither or both drum roll
would you make your way to the floor for strip the willow
are we going to dance
well its physical contact isnt it
the dance floor a few minutes later
it is packed and rather chaotic
sweaty dishevelled dancers sling one another around with the thud of flesh against flesh
toes are stood on and jackets discarded
juliet dances with alex who plunges in with the maximum of violence eventually tripping up and tumbling forcefully among the other dancers
he starts to get up then rests his head back against the floor
david has not been dancing
instead he remains at their table and at the bar drinking steadily and watching the other two
back at the table while most people are still on the dnace floor the trio sit drinking and alex smokes a cigar
that was good
can we talk about something
i have an idea
alex pours champagne on to a stack of glasses
listen its important
we need to talk about what were going to do just stop worrying
alex stands and raises his glass
love and happiness for ever
for ever and ever
alex drinks then puts his glass down
juliet drinks but does not drain her glass
david sits still
whats the problem
i want to talk now
after you drink to love and happiness forever
david i promise we will
keep him happy
its not for me
its for love and happiness forever
david reaches out to take his glass
suddenly alex flings an arm out to point knocking over davids glass and completely losing interest
look over there
you remember cameron
no i dont
whats he doing here
thats not him
yes it is
cameron cameron come on over
from some distance away cameron becomes aware of alex and cautiously makes his way across until he stands a few feet from the table
we thought you were someone else
alex falls forward laughing and the other two also laugh as cameron walks away humiliated again
i love that guy but why does he have to follow us around
anyway what i was wanting to say was this the divine juliet
long time no see
brian approaches and is standing behind their table
would you care to dance
hold on there
who do you think you are
who do you think you are
you interrupted us
im brian mckinley and who are you
well brian mckinley if you want to talk to my girlfriend you talk to me first
if you want to dance with her then you apply in writing three weeks in advance or youre gonna end up insode a fucking bin bag
you didnt apply so you dont dance
shocked and frightened brian backs away then turns around to complete his departure
juliet restrains david with a touch as they watch him go
do you think you could be a little more forceful next time
i think he got the message anyway
that was stressful
i found that stressful
yeah but you were good you were really good
fucking bin bag i liked that
you were good
you explored your maleness to the full there
you think so
well you certainly had a good look around
you were magnificent
the gents toilet
brightly lit and white tiled
alex walk in and goes into a cubicle and closes the door
we hear him whistling and laughing as he passes urine
he keeps muttering bin bag to himself
then he flushes the toilet and opens the door
as he does so a look of surprise appears on his face as he sees someone waiting for him
what a surprise
as alex is speaking camerons fist flies forward hitting him in the face and sending him flying backwards
cameron enters the cubicle and closes the door behind him
mail falls through the letter box
alex does not stir
david emerges from his room ready for his work
he looks towards the kitchen then walks to the door and opens it
we hear the main door closing as david leaves
alex jolts with energy with every sound
the telephone begins to ring
juliet looks at alex expectantly but he does not move
eventually she gets up and answers it
who was it
no one said anything
rendered speechless with desire
i recall that feeling from the days when i had such a thing
are you all right
then lets spend some money
there follows a video depicting the results of alexs and juliets spending spree
it opens with alex seated at the kitchen table talking to the camera absolutely deadpan
its been a struggle but now the days of worry are over the light at the end of the tunnel has expanded into a golden sunrise and at last at
long last nothing will ever be the same again
alex leans out and the camera foloows him as he presses the play button on a tape recorder
the music begins
fast cuts follow occasionally interrupted by out of focus shots of the floor or ceiling as the camera swivels round and is switched on and off
alex wearing several different suits outfits and silk pyjamas
juliet wearing several different outfits
both of them posing with small objets dart
the expensive watch on alexs wrist
juliet takes a picture of alex with a polaroid camera
alex holds the camcorder out at arms length in order to film himself and turns to the camera and adjusts his tie
this is alex law reporting from the scene of his own life and you know im so happy i could die
the music has stopped
david presses the eject button and lifts the video from the player
alex and juliet are seated on the sofa surrounded by their acquisitions and are evidently a little embarrassed
juliet is holding the polaroid of alex
i think we ought to scrub this dont you
david reinserts the tape and presses record
will you calm down
yeah youre making us all nervous
david picks up the polaroid of alex and throws it down then picks up a vase
how much did you pay
i dont know
how much did you pay
i dont know
i dont know
two hundred pounds
two hundred pounds
you paid two hundred pounds for this
thats what it cost david
no no no
thats what you paid for it
two hundred pounds is what you paid for it
we dont know what it cost us yet for you two to have a good time we dont know the cost of that yet
from out in the hall the phone starts to ring
david lies awake in his bed
hearing the noise david sits up in bed then gets out reaching for his clothes
david looks down the stairwell
other neighbours in nightclothes or hurriedly dressed are standing at the open door of the flat below
david descends the the stairs and looks into the hall of the other flat where the occupant an elderly woman lies groaning on the floor
a hand on davids shoulder pushes him out of the way and two uniformed policemen walk past followed by an ambulance man carrying a stretcher
did they take anything
did they take anything
no one acknowledges his question or answers it
the ambulance men emerge carrying the woman her face bruised and cut
everyone else begins to melt away
david stands alone on the darkened stairwell
david lies awake in his bed
someone attempts to open the door but cannot because there are two new security chains on the inside
the door is forced against the chains with no success and alex calls from the other side
what is this
what is going on
david approaches the door
ill let you in
david closes the door and looks through a new spyhole to see alex grinning at him while he releases the chains and then opens the door again
alex walks in
what is this
there was a break in
downstairs i know
pensioners terror ordeal page six
alex hands david a rolled up newspaper
doesnt it worry you
no it doesnt
i tried to let it worry me but it wont
ive worked on that paper for three years
there is a pensioners terror ordeal on page six every day
maybe when im a pensioner itll worry me
alex notices some more tools and the stepladder leading up to the trapdoor
whats all this for more security
i fitted a lock up there
on the inside
oh thatll come in useful
alex is serving on plates from a large bowl of pasta
david and juliet sit at the tabel
is this the same stuff you made last week
no no its different
i hope it tastes better than the other stuff
it tastes different
i dont want it to taste different
i dont know why i bother
is that enough for you
yes thats fine
theres lots more
no im sure thatll be enough
youre not eating
not eating what
not eating like you used to thats what
if you give me the plate ill eat
alex hands him the plate and he starts to eat
alex watches him chew a mouthful
david does so
you know you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it
thats my advice
youd feel much better about it
david has stopped eating
once its spent you wont have to worry about it
be like a weight off your shoulders
you know were right
i want to secure it
what do you mean youre gong to take it to a bank
youre not going to take it to a bank
youre not going to take it to a bank or what you want to bury it
is that it
i dont see the point in that
because thats no good
remember we did what we did we took the money
it was a material calculation
but whats the use if its underground or in some funny bank in some funny place
if you cant spend it if you cant have it what use is it
its nothing all for nothing if you do that
i didnt get into this for nothing so that i could have nothing yeah and you didnt saw his feet off
there is silence
david resumes eating
it tastes different
alex stands at the sink doing some washing up
he hears footsteps from the loft above
he stops what he is doing and walks slowly out ot the hall
in the darkness we can just make out davids eyes as he sits in darkness
calling from below david david what are you doing up there
the torch goes on
david lifts the bag of money from between the rafters
he puts it inside another thick yellow plastic bag which he ties tightly with string
david opens the water tank
alexs voice can be heard throughout
continued calling from below will you come down now
its not safe up there
are you listening to me
security and insanity are not the same thing
juliet sits drinking coffee while alex sands in the doorway looking up towards the trapdoor
leave him alone
he cant stay up there
hell come down
leave him alone
yeah hes got to go to work hasnt he
you think hell come down for that
no but hes looking after the money so whats the problem
looking after it hes probably fucking well eating it
juliet looks through the door from a small office out into the main waiting area in the casualty departmet
it is busy and there are rooms of people nursing injuries waiting to be seen
more file past the door while she watches with no enthusiasm
the trapdoor opens
davids head appears
he looks around and listens carfeully
lumsden answers his telephone
david speaks on the telephone
its my mother sir shes very ill and i think i need to be with her just now
i dont know
the doctors arent sure
it could go either way
yes sir ill certainly stay in touch
david shaves carefully with a safety razor
bacon and eggs fry in a pan
david attends to them while drinking from a large tumbler of orange juice
a sister hands juliet a casualty case sheet
juliet reads it
what does that mean
i dont know
he wouldnt show me
juliet draws back the curtain of a cubicle
alex is sitting on a trolly
boy am i glad to see you
what are you doing here
we have to talk
your painful groin
she turns and walks away
alex chases after her
but first him
now ive been thinking oh good
he wont do anything for me but for you forget it
he isnt safe up there
if you really cared about him youd use your influence to get him down then hed be safe
and the money
we could put it somewhere
where he cant get it
now you thought of that not me
forget it hell come down
juliet walks away
the hall is empty and the flat is silent
we see the trapdoor
david sits in the darkness
a crack of light penetrates beside the trapdoor
alex and juliet sit at the table eating in silence
the doorbell rings
alex and juliet look at one another
alex resumes eating
arent you going to answer it
well im not expecting anyone either
juliet glares at him
alex approaches the door and is about to open it
at the last moment he checks himself and looks through the spyhole
tim and andy stand outside the door
alex slightly puzzled fixes the security chains before opening the door
as soon as he opens it the door is kicked wide open as the security chains break off
tim and andy enter the flat
in a whirlwind of force they drag and shove alex and juliet into the living room and bind them up with cord
there are no words apart from slightly muffled cries
at the end of this andy stands in front of alex holding a crowbar
swiftly and without warning he cracks it across alexs shins
then andy slowly puts one one end of the crowbar into alexs mouth
for a moment he does nothing then just as slowly again he takes the crowbar out
its in the loft
the trapdoor is closed but the sound of it being unlocked can just be heard although not by anyone in the flat
tim pulls the ladder across to the trapdoor
it is completely dark in the loft but as the trapdoor opens a shaft of light strikes upwards and illuminates a small pool around the opening
away from the trapdoor there appears to be a wall of uniform darkness but then we see a pair of eyes in the darkness
it is david
he stands perfectly still
there is a hammer in his right hand
tims head appears through the trapdoor
cautiously he lifts himself through and balances on the beams
the hall is empty but we can see the open trapdoor
suddenly there is a single thud as might be caused by a body landing heavily on and across some beams in the loft
david stands motionless in the dark exactly as before
andy has heard the single thud
he strains to hear anything else but does not
slowly he backs away to the door of the living room keeping the crowbar trained on alex as he does so
he looks back and up towards the trapdoor
once again a small pool of light emanates from the open trapdoor
andy emerges into the front of this crowbar in hand peering into the darkness
carefully he stands up and moves out of the light and steps across the beams
his foot strikes something and he looks down
tims body lies spread eagled beneath him
he looks up
to one side of him is the brass light switch
andy lifts his arm reaches towards it and switches it on
sparks pour out for a moment and then the light comes on for a fraction of a second long enough for andy to see davids face is only centimetres from
alex and juliet are bound together as before
there is a loud thud from the ceiling following by a few heavy steps
then andys body falls headfirst through the trapdoor straight down to the floor below landing awkwardly and coming to rest with his head hanging back looking towards alex and juliet
andy takes one agonal breath and dies
blood trickles from the side of his mouth
tims body lands on andy
david drops himself from the hatch to the floor
david takes a large knife from a wooden block
back in the hall he kneels holding the knife beside tim
noticing something at the top of tims neck he uses the knife to lift away tims t shirt
a tattoo covers tims neck
david looks at it then stands up
he walks through to the living room where alex and juliet still bound watch him approach
he looks at them for a moment then extends the knife and cuts the cord in one place
in a scene similar to the dismemberment of hugo we see davids shoulders as he saws back and forth at something unseen
he stops and reaches out for the hammer picks it up and raises it above his head
the van is silhouetted against a rising sun
the tools and the yellow sack slide about in the back of the van
david is driving
alex and juliet are huddled silently away from him
david seems quite at ease
a thick bunch of keys dangles from the ignition
juliet observes them
david sits still in the darkness
alex sits at his desk fidgeting about to write something but unable to start
on the screen of his word processor is a page mock up with the headline cats eat pensioner
as the telephone on his desk rings he is startled then reaches out slowly lifts it fractionally and replaces it
hunched over a vdu the salesman is offering juliet a range of flights
october th direct flight london heathrow to rio de janeiro british airways you are looking at seven hundred and sixty five pounds
seven six five
that sounds fine
air portugal on the other hand via lisbon same day five hundred and sixty five
five six five
its up to you
direct but then youre looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds
thats nine one two
its up to you
yes the first ones fine
its up to you
new outfit via caracas and bogot no catering
four hundred and eleven pounds
four one one
good value but refueling at bogot is variable
the first one was fine
well its up to you
seven six five
how will you be paying
the hall is empty but we can hear davids footsteps on the beams above
alex sits watching the wicker man on televison
he can hear the footsteps above
he turns the sound up on the television so that he cannot hear them but he keeps looking up at the ceiling as though he expects to hear them or
eventually he turns the sound back down and after a moments silence the footsteps start again back and forth then stop
alex looks up
without warning there is the sound of an electric drill
the blade of the drill appears through the ceiling and is then withdrawn
alex is shocked
other drill holes appear
holes are drilled in the ceilings
rods of light penetrate up from the holes interrupting but not obliterating the darknes
david sits back pleased with his work
juliet sits at her desk
alex stands in the doorway
he is about to speak
juliet raises a finger to her lips
they both look at the ceiling
establishing shot of alex and juliet in garden
the trapdoor is open
david is searching through alexs desk looking through letters and folders then shoving them back into drawers
no definitely not
and thats that
i refuse to discuss it further
its the only way
no im not frightened
a little terrified maybe
did you see what happened to the last two who tried that
they went up alive and they came down dead the difference i mean alive dead dead alive that sort of thing
it wasnt difficult to spot
he killed them both he cut them up
david is now searching through juliets desk
he picks up a large brown envelope and looks into it
beneath it is the airline ticket envelope
the doorbell rings
mccall and mitchell stand outside the door
david opens the door
im detective inspector mccall and this is dc mitchell
i wonder if we could ask you some questions
its about the burglary
can we come in
david sits on the sofa while the two policemen sit on armchairs several feet apart
so i just heard her cries for help and all that and when i went downstairs there were already those other people there so i just stood around really waiting
you know how people do and then when your colleagues arrived i came back upstairs
and thats about all i think
i didnt actually see anything useful i dont think
did you hear anything before he cries
no not that i recall i was asleep
have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days
no nothing sorry
well if you do youll let us know
and the other three people on the flat did they hear anything
there are only two other people in the flat
mccall consults a notebook
who said there were four
we understood there were four people living here
not always of course but now four
who said there were four
and how unsatisfactory to have misleading information
only three people here
take a note of that mitchell
only three rather than four
write it down
you can use numbers or words i have no preference
which are you using
dc mitchell is a rising star mr
under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade
i doubt it
and these two other people did they hear anything
no they were asleep
they didnt even wake up
why do you think you woke and they didnt
i dont know
maybe im a light sleeper
uncomfortably david realizes that mitchell has noted down even this last trivial remark in a painful longhand and has underlined a short segment of it
in the hallway of the flat mitchell stands at the open main door waiting to leave
mccall is kneeling at the door to hugos room tracing his finger down the broken lintel and lock
david looks on
loks like you had a break in up here as well
someone lost the key
mccall gently pushes the door open and the light from the hall illuminates hugos room
is this where no one stays
yeah thats right thats it
david notices that mitchell is writing this down
youll wait in the hall
ill wait there
and if it sounds like im being killed youll phone the police youll tell them everything
except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place
thats important to me
i need to die misunderstood
as smart as you are youll need a little help
she hands alex a yale key
alex stares at it
in the darkness the sound of the lock being turned is heard
alex tsands at the top of the ladder holding the key in the trapdoor lock
all right david what im going to do is im going to open this lock and im going to come up and whats important is that you remain calm
there is one light on
juliet stands at the bottom of the ladder
having opened the trapdoor alex stops and listens but there is no sound above his own breathing
juliet throws up a torch which he catches
he switches it on
it shines then goes out and he knocks it against the ladder making it work again
slowly he pushes the trapdoor open
the trapdoor opens
below it alex crouches on the ladder expecting attack at any moment
he looks back down to juliet who returns his gaze then he slowly raises himself into the loft
he turns around quickly darting the torchlight around into corners and squinting in the darkness but he sees nothing
the torch goes out
cursing he knocks it against a beam and it shines again
slowly he moves further from the trapdoor into the centre of the loft still turning around and worried about what might be behind him
juliet stands waiting braced for sounds of conflict
alex is still looking but has relaxed a little feeling les in danger
in one corner he notices davids pile of left possessions and the mat on which he has been sleeping
he moves towards it
juliet stands still waiting
alex stands in davids corner
with another sweep of the torch he can still see nothing
he calls to juliet
he isnt up here
a close up of juliets face just as davids hand slams across her mouth gripping her tightly while his other hand clamps on the back of her head
davids mouth is right up against her ear as he spits a warning into it
tell him to look for the money
slowly david relaxes his grip on juliet
look for the money
alex cheerful now is looking in the rafters
dont worry thats what im doing
david holds juliet across her face again
she is terrified and does not struggle
were you expecting anyone
some friends maybe
someone you talked to
who have you talked to
if i think youre lying alex stands gazing around the loft
from the loft well its not up here
david pulls juliet to one side
alex is about to descend when he notices the water tank
he walks over and lifts the lid
his face breaks into a smile as he realizes what it holds
he dips an arm into the tank raises the yellow bag then quickly lowers it again
alex steps back from the water tank
alex appears at the top of the ladder
without looking he slides down as quickly as he can calling out as he does so
juliet i have alex reaches the base of the ladder
he turns around to find himself facing the blade of the battery operated drill held by david
juliet stands off to one side
david holds the drill even closer until it is almost touching the centre of alexs forehead and presses the trigger to turn the blade slowly as he speaks
alex does not move at all
you looking for me
looking for you
what did you want
was that it
we just wanted to speak to you
alexs hands and sleeves are wet
a few drops of water fall from his fingertips
unnoticed by the other two he slowly wipes his hands on the back of his jeans
who else have you wanted to speak to
maybe you thought theyd already got me
the blade os the drill scrapes alexs skin
i dont know what youre talking about
he doesnt know david
david holds the drill back slightly while he thinks
it could go either way
well maybe you dont david lowers the drill and smiles
im talking about the police
alex has just woken up
he rubs his forehead
there is a nick in it where the drill has scratched
he rubs at it and examines the drop of blood on the end of his finger
looking down from a hole in the ceiling we see into alexs room where he is getting dressed
alex leaves his room and enters the hall
looking down from a hole in the ceiling we see into alexs room where he is getting dressed
looking down on alex as he leaves the flat and closes the door
david scurries back across the beams to look down through another hole
he looks for several seconds
note in the following sequence juliets face is not seen until her comment on it
juliet lies on her bed
she throws the covers back
david is still looking down through the hole
juliet moves about her room
she is wearing a large baggy t shirt
david still watching
juliets legs are seen as the t shirt lands on the floor beside them
david sits back suddenly recoiling from the activity
he scrambles back across to his mat where he sits back down and closes his eyes
then he opens them and scrambles back to look down again
the room is empty
the sound of the flat door closing is heard
from davids point of view we see davids head appears beneath the trapdoor
he hangs from the hatch and drops down to the floor
david emerges from the bathroom and walks towards the kitchen
we follow him in
david takes orange juice out of the fridge and pours himself a glass
he sits at the table and looks briefly into a corner that we cannot see
the expression oh his face does not change and his voice is impassive
i thought youd gone to work
with a face like this
there are bruises across it where she was gripped by david
in close up we track along the following half sentence in the event of my death i want the following facts to be known the remainder of the screen is
alex sits at his desk deciding what to type next on the screen seen before
a young office boy approaches his desk
the editor wants to see you
david sits while juliet talks
she is now seated behind him
i remember how things used to be here and i see how they are now and i dont know why it is
i dont know how we let you become like this
we were your friends and we should have looked after you
alex sits nervously while the editor sits on the side of his desk
out in the woods
i dont know anything about it
of course you dont know anything about it
if you knew anything about it i wouldnt have to send you over there to cover it
but theres no animals involved
i know but you need a change
and besides were short
i dont know
dont know what
well ive got this story its really good im working on that is good i feel it could be big it this eh and its you know its incredible
am i right did you say beyond recognition
david and juliet are seated as before
i should hope so
david turns towards her
he reaches out and softly touches her face
maybe we can still sort everything out
juliet takes his hand
we can try
they look at one another
several police and unmarked vehicles including one mobile incident room stand on a rough track
another car arrives at the end and is parkeed to one side
alex steps out
from where he stands alex can see towards the site of the burials
there are a few policemen uniformed and plain clothes and a small knot of journalists kept at bay by plastic tape draped from tree to tree
mounds of earth mark the site of the exhumations
alex walks past the other journalists into the woods
he looks back towards the sight then turns to look in the opposite direction
he finds himself at the edge of a golf course
from the green to the graves is hardly any distance
to one side alex sees mccall and mitchell hunched in earnest discussion
mitchell looks up briefly and ctaches alexs eye
the kitchen is empty
we track through the kitchen and out into the hall stopping at the door to juliets room
david and juliet are seated on the bed
among the junk on her bedside table is the polaroid photograph of alex propped up against a tumbler
juliet reaches out and turns it away before pulling david towards her
several journalists sit close together on plastic chairs
alex sits at the back near the half open door
at the other end three police officers face them
they are a medium ranking uniformed officer and to one side of him mitchell and then mccall both of whom sit in silence
all right ladies and gentlemen the releasable and print worthy facts of the day so far are as follows
late yesterdat afternoon forestry workers came across one set of human remains lying in a grave which appeared to have been recently dug
further excavation on our part has revealed two similar deeper graves again containing human remains
alex turns his head and looks out of the door towards the burial site now enclosed in a plastic tent
he continues to stare at it
while alex is looking the sound of laughter and uniformed officers subsequent comments become muted and we hear the memory of a sound in alexs head it is the noise
of the saw going back and forth across the victims limbs
as and when the corpses are removed we will endeavour to ascertain the mode of death and duration of burial as well as identification which will of course be passed
on to you after informing where possible the next of kin
alex discreetly stands up and slips out of the van
alex walks away from the incident room towards his car
he breaks into a run for a few paces
the noise of the sawing continues
as he reaches his car alex fumbles in his pockets for his keys
he is sweating and trembling
he drops his keys
as he bends down to pick them up his foot slips on the wet grass
he falls to his knees his forehead banging against the car door
he kneels for a moment gripping the keys his head resting against the door
the noise of the sawing stops
from behind the arm of a police constable reaches out and his hand rests on alexs shoulder
