we catch a glimpse of young jake lamotta
jake lamotta wearing a tux is shadow boxing
we are unsure of where he is he moves in and out of the shadows
at hes overweight and out of shape but the balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward
with short bursts of light
he is rehearsing a nightclub monologue
good evening ladies and gentlemen
its a thrill to be standing here talking to you wonderful people
in fact its a thrill to be standing
i havent seen so many people since my last fight at madison square garden
after that fight a reporter asked me jake where do you go from here
i said to a hospital
i fought one hundred and six professional fights and still none of them bums figured out how to fight me they kept hitting me in the head
and thats why im here tonight
starts to sing when the fighters not engaged in his employment his employment although he was champ and quite the rage he must go somewhere else to seek employment seek
but a fighters life is not a bowl of cherries still id rather have an egg than a fist upon my face
jimmy reeves a fast black middleweight jabs lamotta years old in the face
jake staggers forward
no matter how hard lamotta is hit no matter how often he always staggers forward like a bull
the bell sounds
battered jake slumps on the stool in his corner
europe and asia are already at war
young soldiers freshly recruited dot the hostile audience each screaming at the fighters in the ring
suddenly words are exchanged a girl screams and a soldier and a civilian stand and start swinging
and in the ring jake lamotta takes a swig of water and spits blood into the bucket his younger brother joey holds for him
tony his trainer works the cuts
you didnt have to come to cleveland to get beat by a moulan yan jake
hes got you jake
youre coming up for the tenth
you gotta knock him out
the bell sounds for the tenth
jake pulls himself up and charges at reeves
reeves slides away jabbing punching piling up points
in jakes corner joey stands and yells at jake a grand apiece
we got a grand apiece on this jake
a fucking grand
jake suddenly corners reeves and unleashes a desperate wild alley fighting attack
one ferocious punch after another
the spectators go wild everyones up for the kill
reeves staggers then falls to the canvas
the referee counts one two three four
the gamblers call out new odds ten to one for reeves the underdog
joey excited sees that time is running out and steps in front of the bell
he swings his arms pretending not to realize he literally holds back the timers arm for a few seconds
this gives jake more time for a knockout but not enough
joey is pushed back and the bell rings at the count of nine ending the match
boos and cheers
the bettors scramble back to the bookie to get their money
jake dances around the ring kissing his gloves and thrusting them toward the crowd
joey rushes out and hugs him
the announcer steps into the ring with the mike ladies and gentlemen the winner under the rules of the cleveland boxing commission after ten rounds by a decision jimmy reeves
the announcer holds up reeves arm as his corner tries to lift him off the canvas still out cold
two attendants bring in a stretcher
jake is stunned
he still prances around now trying to figure out what happened
he raises his arms in victory and the fans go crazy cheering ripping chairs out fighting with the cops throwing bottles and junk into the ring
people go into the ring
to jake dont get out of the ring
you won the fight let him go out first
reeves being placed on the stretcher
a ringside official signals the organist and she starts to play the star spangled banner
reeves is carried out
only then do joey and tony escort jake out of the ring
its a rough neighborhood inhabited primarily by welfare cases and street kids
in the street two young punks or years old exchange words and start to fight
their friends cheer them on
salvy and joey turn the corner

gleasons a small gym and fight club stands on th street and rd avenue above a small sandwich shop
each day bobby gleason posts a small sign alongside the door listing the fighters who will be working out
jakes name is posted at the top the other names are unmemorable
gleasons has a single sparring ring and ten training bags
about a dozen managers train their fighters out at gleasons
for cents spectators sit in the gallery and watch the workouts
jake is sparring with joey in the ring
theyve been working out for a while now
the bell rings ending the third round
jake prances about the ring waiting for the bell to sound again
at that moment salvy along with two other young button men actually they are very young about joeys age enter the gym
they are well dressed over coat ties suits flashy rings etc
they say hello to some people by the door
jake looks over and notices them
salvy looks over to the ring
waves hey joey joey waves back
waves again jake how you doin
jake nods to salvy very cold
salvy notices and can feel that hes not exactly wanted there by jake
joey notices the same and becomes a bit nervous
salvy sits down near the ring but not as close as hed like to
his two friends frankie and guido sit nearby also
jake goes to joeys corner
did you know they were coming up here
joey doesnt answer
answer me when i talk to you
they just wanted to talk to you
interrupting dont ever bring those kids up here again
im working out im killin myself in here and they walk around like they fuckin own the neighborhood
salvy and the others see joey being chewed out by jake
they begin to feel unwelcome at the gym
the bell sounds
jake is more aggressive now as he corners joey
jake swings away with body punches
joey cant block them
salvy and the others watch
the bell sounds again
with that salvy and the others start to leave
to joey hey joey we better go

joey dazed turns to wave
theyre your friends
jake watches them leave
and that hard on salvy
whos he think he is

i didnt tell them to come
the bell sounds again
jake hits joey a few more solid body punches
joey gets angry and fights back with a flurry of punches which have no effect on jake
thats right fight back
i got laid three times before i came up here this morning and i can still break your ass
joey fights back but its no use
the two continue to swing it out as salvy watches unseen from the doorway
the shorehaven pool spic and span in the summer sun is the closest thing to a country club in the bronx
an eight foot fence stands between the pool and the street
jake wearing slacks and a sportshirt hangs out with the boys near the bar area
older made men play cards
a young fan walks by and says hey jake
at the opposite end of the pool where the girls gossip and sunbathe joey swaps small talk with vickie a school girl about
vickie is a knockout
salvy frankie and junior are with vickie and her friends
they joke with joey
jake watches salvy and vickie
joey is talking pan to vickie

irma enters from the bedroom

interrupting how many times do i have to hit her

they exit to street
joey and jake come out of the building and start walking down the street
irma opens the window on the second floor right above them and shouts out to them go ahead thats all youre good for to go out and leave me here
like a dog
you and your brother
you dont even look like brothers
you look like faggots
thats what you look like faggots
jake and joey walk faster down the block pretending that irma must be shouting at someone else
she throws a bottle at them
it smashes in the street
a neighborhood dance is in progress
a small band is playing while mainly older couples dance
there are two priests present
the younger people are divided into two groups the boys who are dressed in suits and ties and spend most of their time at the bar area and the girls
who are in evening dresses and spend most of their time dancing together
some of the more popular girls are surrounded by wise guys
there are tables near the dance floor with set ups bottles of scotch rye and a bucket of ice on them
these tables are the bases of operation for different neighborhood groups as if they were street corners
jake and joey are walking toward a table
vera a young neighborhood girl blocks their way as she bends over to talk to some guys at a table
veras well built and knows it
joey tries to move one way vera again blocks his way
this little game goes on for a few seconds then look could you move a little
would you mind darling
mind what mr
annoyed eh girlie take a walk
jake starts to move forward joey stops him
to vera all right darling ill just stand here and wait
joey cups his hands and grabs veras breasts
vera squeals covers her breasts and moves back
joey and jake walk past her
joey and jake sit down at an empty table
do you see her yet
give me a chance
let me look
jake tries to find her camera pans until we find her
joey points out a distant table
he spots vickie with a couple of other girls
vickie locks beautiful and is obviously having a good time
there she is over there on the other side
what did i tell you
oh aint she nice
aint she a fuckin doll
as they watch we see from jakes pov salvy frankie and junior show up at vickies table
they are in overcoats and hats and dont sit down
they are obviously on their way to bigger things than a neighborhood dance and vickie and her girlfriends are glad to go with them
they get up to leave
be right back
salvy frankie junior vtckie and the other two girls leave the dance hall
jake unseen follows them to the entrance way as they go out onto the sidewalk
jake watches as salvy ushers everyone into his cadillac and then drives off
jake stares after the car for a moment then goes back inside
jake and joey get out of their packard convertible and walk over to the fence surrounding the pool
vickie is by the pool
calling out to vickie hey vickie cmere
dont be afraid
just say hello
this is my brother
vickie comes over to the fence
vickie i want you to meet my brother jake

she starts to go
jake kisses his hand and holds it up to the fence by her lips
jake drives his packard convertible down shore road
vickie sits in the passenger seat her blonde hair blowing in the wind
vickie feels jakes eyes all over her and loves it
on the radio bing crosby sings just one more charce
jake parks across the street from the new miniature golf course on shore road
the shore road course is one of the best
the first green features a pink windmill
jake and vickie get out to cross the street
you dont talk very much
i aint ever talked to a movie star before
giggles i aint no movie star
im just in high school
i thought you was a movie star
a bus heads toward them
jake holds up his hand
any bus gives you trouble i knock it out for ya
the bus stops for them as they cross the street
jake sets vickies ball on the tee facing the windmill
you go first
let me watch how to do this
you dont get nothin done by watchin
you just gotta do it
here ill help you
jake hands vickie the putter then moves behind her and puts her hand on the club
just grip up a little tighter
youre gonna be real good at this
how does that feel
it feels real good
just keep your eye on the ball
should i hit it
just give it a nice little tap
vickie swings and the ball rolls into the center of the windmill
vickie breaks free and follows her ball
i cant find my ball
can you see it
vickie bends and looks under the windmill
jake bends and looks
can you see it
what does that mean
jake takes vickie by the arm
it means the game is over
jake throws his putter on the next green
lets get outa here
jake and vickie pull up to a tenement
jake dashes around the car to open the door for vickie
they enter the building
joseph lamotta sr
is finishing his sunday dinner with a glass of wine as jake and vickie enter
this is my new girlfriend vickie
v for victory

jake is anxious
vickie is scared

joe stares at him
jake grasps vickies arm firmly
the bedroom is a few rooms away from the kitchen
jake closes the door
there is a warm light in the bedroom
jake this is your fathers bedroom
thats all right
he dont mind
the room is sparsely furnished
on the bureau there is a large framed photo of the boxing brothers jake and joey lamotta
joey wears a suit in the picture
jake puts vickie on the bed and removes his jacket and tie
he pushes her against the bed and gently undresses her
they make love
jake is fighting sugar ray robinson
its their nd match
we see highlights of the fight jake is fighting ferociously but sugar ray is a formidable opponent
an announcers voice gives a blow by blow description
jake takes a lot of punishment from sugar ray until the th round
then jake nails sugar ray with a savage left
jake chases sugar ray and pounds him with a left and a right
sugar ray gets in a right cross
they stand toe to toe fighting
then jake lands a left to sugar rays stomach and knocks him through the ropes
jake goes after sugar ray but the referee stops him
sugar ray gets back into the ring and sinks to one knee while the referee counts to
the bell sounds
time cut the announcer calls out that jake is the winner
jake throws kisses
the crowd goes wild
jakes press conference
five reporters meander around the gym waiting for jake to finish sparring
they are not thrilled with their assignment
jake is not thrilled with having them there
the gallery is spotted with the usual bronx types
the lone exception is vickie dressed very well very sensual and quite content to watch jake make his sparring partners lives miserable despite their head and belly protectors
joey is off in one of the corners arguing with one of the the fuckin papers are full of robinson and nothing on jake and jake knocked him clear outa
the ring in detroit
hes the only guy ever to beat robinson
whatsa matter with you
i thought we had an arrangement
we do joey
you know we do
you holding me up for more cash or what
the bell sounds ending the sparring round
i cant print nothing if jake wont give me nothing
joey walks over to the ring
the reporter follows not far behind
youre makin us look stupid
i brought these guys up here now you dont wanna talk to them
what are ya doin
open your mouth for christsake
jake nods his head steps out of the ring and goes directly over to the reporter who is about to say hi jake
interrupting im tallin you now when i read this it better not make me look bad
jake did i ever make you look bad before
maybe it wasnt you but you know what im talkin about
interrupting dont worry
its gonna be all right
to reporter ask him your questions
all right jake youre being talked about as the top middleweight contender
do you think another victory over sugar ray will get you a shot at the title
theres nobody else around who wants to fight me theyre all afraid
i dont see why i shouldnt have a shot at the title right now
well the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing in new york
and theyre saying that you dont cooperate
you guys know more about that than i do
i just fight
interrupting he fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight
interrupting im the only guy ever to beat sugar ray and i still dont have a shot at the title
you just fought sugar ray two weeks ago and youre training like this right now
are you afraid sugar ray might beat you this time
i tell you what
you hit me here
points to his right cheek sugar ray hits me here
points to his left cheek i cant tell the difference
i just fight
jake turns to vickie smiles and prepares for his next jake wearing pleated dress slacks sits on the edge of the bed examining his muscle tone
he studies his small fists
squeezes each knuckle
twists his wrists
vickie steps out of the bathroom wearing a nightie and panties
are you sure we should be doing this
come over here
you said never to touch you before a fight
lovingly if you let me do it ill murder you
you said i couldnt
youve been good for two weeks
jake watches vickie approach him
he respects her as he would a shrine he slowly removes her sheer nightie
his round hands caress her smooth skin
he glides his bruised knuckles across her shoulders pride on his face
she kisses his bruised knuckles sensuously then his bruised face
take off my pants
do what i say
he touches her breasts as she removes his trousers
now take the rest off
jake you made me promise not to get you excited
she pulls off his shorts
vickie is now getting excited
she kisses his chest and licks it
i like the gym smell
now take your panties off
now touch me
takes her hand here
she caresses his broad shoulders and runs her hand along his erection
jakes lips are trembling
he quickly turns his back on vickie goes into the bathroom and gets a full glass of cold water
vickie watches as he puts his erection in the glass of cold water
she is shocked and surprised
i cant do it
i cant fool around
this robinson i gotta beat him again
i cant fool around
dont come near me
jake grabs her again and kisses her
then gently but firmly he turns her around and pushes her out
its starting again and he must stop it
he goes back the bathroom and closes the door
this is jakes rematch with sugar ray their rd fight
an announcers voice gives a blow by blow description
the fourth round jake is in serious trouble
sugar ray knocks him with a hard right then a series of rights and lefts
jake is punched all the way across the ring but stays in there
the seventh round jake coming on strong forces sugar ray into his own corner then lands a left hook to his chin
sugar ray drops and takes a nine count
this time however the blow does not have a crippling effect on sugar ray instead he comes back and outboxes jake
time cut the announcer calls out the decision sugar ray is the winner
jake is stunned
the crowd boos so loud and for so long that the announcer is unable to introduce the fighters in the next bout
joey and tony are in the dressing room
jake sits on the table dejected
his hand is being examined by a doctor
two hangers on are also present
angry they robbed us
those fuckin judges what the fuck fight were they watching
if i see them on the street ill break their heads
decision robinson my fuckin ass
those judges give him the decision cause hes goin in the army next week
how else could this have happened

this was our shot
they out and out robbed us
mario comes back from the door
vickie is here jake
i dont wanna see nobody
you want us to wait for you
no take her home
i wanna be alone for a while
jake now alone goes into the bathroom
he looks in the bathroom mirror
after a pauseg he touches his newly acquired bruises and bandages
he combs his hair
we hear the beginning of an early frank sinatra song
this song carries over onto the following montage
this montage covers the period between and early

a comedian is in the middle of his act
jake vickie joey and janet sit at a nearby table
janet an attractive blonde is are of joeys girlfriends the moment you set eyes on her you know this is not his wife
the lounge is very crowded
the comedian interrupts his routine to point out that jake lamotta is in the audience and even tries a little harmless joking at jakes expense

there is applause
jake smiles and gives a hesitant wave

so you just go ahead and think about who you want
tony janiro wearing boxer trunks steps off the scale
eddie eagan a white haired heavyset man in his mid forties calls out the weight
the basement of the new york boxing commission on worth street is a sparse room crowded with reporters trainers and tony janiro lbs
and one half
jake steps on the scale
he looks weak and woozy
after the customary adjustments eagan calls out jake lamotta lbs
and one fourth
theres a commotion in jakes camp
just a minute
jake joey and tony confer
jake gets off the scale and enters the mens room
an official follows him
jake forces himself to urinate
jake comes out of the bathroom and gets back on the scale
this is official
lamotta stares at janiro
on the nose
jake throws janiro a kiss
its the last round and jake is pouring it on a beaten and virtually helpless janiro
the crowd chants lamotta
half the audience is already on its feet
the kill is imminent and they love it
jake lands one blow after another
he is relentless
several rows back tommy como salvy and several other made guys sit with sober looks on their faces
jake moves in fast and with a powerful barrage smashes janiros nose plastering it against his left cheek
the final bell rings
janiro his legs all rubber staggers back to his corner
jake prances about kissing his fists and throwing them to the crowd
joey rushes out throws jakes leopard skin robe over him and embraces him
jake looks right at como and salvy
an announcer steps into the center of the ring the winner by unanimous decision in ten rounds jake lamotta
i love you
jake weak from losing the weight and winning the fight still manages to prance around the ring victoriously
vickie now near the ring throws kisses to jake
shouts to vickie this is my night

he bends down and gives her a kiss through the ropes
im making everything up to you

joey fully clothed opens the gate and looks around
jake is sitting alone near the deep end
joey walks over to him

interrupting resigned yeah i know
as billy fox steps off the scales eddie eagan calls out billy fox pounds
joey removes jakes leopard skin robe as he steps on the scale
the reporters crowd around
jake lamotta pounds
jakes handlers urge him with words of encouragement as they walk toward his dressing room
eagan walks over
whats up colonel
id like to talk to jake a minute
i suppose you heard what everybodys been saying jake
what whos been sayin
you were a big favorite in this fight
then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until youre a underdog

eagan taps jake on the shoulder
thats all i wanted to hear
jake glares at eagan as the commissioner walks away
the old garden is packed
the ex champs the press the officials the mob guys the fans theyre all here
the fighters are announced
billy fox and jake touch gloves and return to their corners
fox is taller and has a longer reach than jake
the bell sounds and the fighters come out
fox goes to the head jake goes to the body
fox lands a solid blow to jakes jaw but lamotta is unfazed
fox is surprised
in the past his opponents have gone down when he connected
in the audience como salvy and some other boys watch with interest
jake moves in with a rapid series of trademark body blows
all of a sudden fox is wobbly
jake goes for the head then cuts his punch short
fox is about to go down
jake throws his arms around fox to make sure he doesnt fall
to fox stand up
what the fuck are you doin
the referee breaks them apart and fox remounts his attack
jake bicycles into a corner and lets fox work him over
fox connects once twice three times
jake barely defends himself but he doesnt go down either
the crowd starts to smell a fix
there are calls from the got your swimming trunks on jake
i hope theyre paying you enough
jake is acting stunned
tony not aware of whats going on is slapping jake
whats the matter with you
whats the matter with you
the sign reads round four
jake is in the center of the ring taking a relentless pasting from fox
jakes arms hang at waist level
fox lands one blow after another
the stink of a fix permeates the arena
jake is furious that fox cant deck him
he curses through his mouthpiece as he absorbs blow after blow hit me
whats the matter with you you motherfucker
boos and catcalls echo through the garden
this is not even a fight
the referee realizing this steps in between fox and lamotta waves his arms and signals that fox is the winner by a technical knockout
as he does jake spits his mouthpiece in disgust at fox and struts back to his corner
jake joey and tony are already on their way out of the arena as the referee declares fox the winner
como and the others satisfied get up to leave
as a reporter and a photographer come through the door we see and hear a commotion in the hall behind them
they rush in look and stop by the door
there is silence except for jakes uncontrollable sobbing
the atmosphere is like that of funeral
jake is seated behind the rubbing table
he is still in his leopard skin robe
his head hangs low as he sobs
the photographer snaps a picture
the handler motions to him to stop and then goes and sits near the door
the reporter still stands near the doorway seeming quite stunned by the scene he is witnessing but nevertheless continuing to scribble away on his pad
joey standing near jake has his back to everyone his shoulders are shaking his lips are tightly drawn
he cries soundlessly
tony is pacing nearby
dont fight anymore
pause its a free country dont fight anymore
between sobs why did they have to stop it
why did they have to stop it
the reporter leans over to the handler and whispers
quietly he mustve been really hurt in the nd
he didnt answer me when i tried to tell him something in the corner
jake still buried in his robe becomes aware of the hum of voices and shouts out get everyone out of here
the reporter and the photographer leave
jake continues to sob
insert close up of a daily news headline from november board suspends lamotta
jake dejected sits on the couch
in front of him on the coffee table are scattered several newspapers including the one with the headline we have just seen
joey paces in front of jake
yelling it woulda been so easy jack
joey goes into a boxing stance
stick out your hands jake
gwan do it
jabs at him protect yourself rummy
jake out of reflex sticks out his hands
as he does joey feigns a hit and falls onto the floor out cold
jake looks down at him
joey pops to his feet
thats all there was to it
what the fuck they want
i took the dive
they want me to fall down too
i dont fall down for nobody
i never went down in my life
joey what do i gotta do

the applause dies out as he speaks good evening ladies and gentlemen
its a thrill to be standin here talking to you wonderful people

i havent seen so many people since my last fight at madison square garden
after that fight a reporter asked me jake where do you go from here

then suddenly falling into character
he quotes lagos speech in othello
oh beware my lord of jealousy
it is the green eyed monster which doth mock the meat it feeds on
that cuckold lives in bliss who certain of his fate loves not his woronger but o what damned minutes tells he oer who dotes yet doubts suspects yet fondly loves
thats from somethin called othello is whispering nothing
is leaning cheek to cheek
is meeting noses
kissing with inside lip
stopping the career of laughter with a sign
a note infallible of breaking honesty horsing foot on foot
skulking in corners
wishing clocks more swift
and all eyes blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only that would unseen be wicked
is this nothing
why then the world and all thats int is nothing the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing my wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings if this be nothing

jake nude does push ups on the floor
his body is bathed in sweat
he pushes himself up then collapses
his eyes are glazed over from lack of strength
he makes his way to the door and pounds on it
tony opens the door and gets on his knees beside jake
it aint worth it jake
barely coherent what time is it

vickie is seated on the sofa reading newspapers
jake is pacing

pause i dont know
the lamotta dauthuille middleweight championship is told through the eyes and words of the ringside announcer
jake is not doing well
ladies and gentlemen ive sat in front of these microphones for over twenty years but this is the strangest championship bout ive ever seen
with two minutes to go in the final round the champion the mighty bull from the bronx is just simply taking punch after punch from the challenger
dauthuille scores a combination then backpedals
lamotta pursues him
one minute to go
laurent dauthuillle who has already beat lamotta in a non title bout is about to fulfill a dream to bring the middleweight crown back to france
in the ring jake looks like hes on queer street
bouncing off the ropes opening his jaw to dauthuille
but dauthuilles punches lack strength
jakm is playing possum
thirty seconds to go
the bull starts to swing
lamotta comes in for a brutal body combinaticn one two three four punches
lamotta has landed a solid left hook to the frenchmans jaw
dauthuille seems confused
lamotta is swinging wildly now right left right left
dauthuille is backing off
everyone is on their feet
i can hardly see ladies and gentlemen
dauthuille is on the ropes
lamotta hits a right dauthuille is down
dauthuille is down
referee lou handler is counting him out three four five if dauthuille can stand hell win the decision eight nine dauthuille is on one knee ten
its all over
with thirteen seconds left on the clock jake lamotta has retained his middleweight championship in one of the most remarkable combacks in boxing
dauthuille is standing now confused
but the fight is over
an announcer holds up jakes victorious hand
he seems as surprised as everyone else
tony throws jakes robe around his shoulders as the announcer calls out the middleweight champion and still champion by a knockout in fifteen rounds the bronx bull the raging bull
the crowd cheers
jake raises his arms in victory
it is after the fight
tony vickie and others are in the room
some people are leaving
congratulations are heard
tony puts away jakes fight gear
jake half dressed looks troubled
to vickie i miss joey
i wish joey was here
why dont you just call him
tell him how you feel you miss him
tell him youre sorry
pauze ok all right
telephones in the hall
dial his number
vickie goes to the pay phone in the hall and dials long distance
jake is nervous but follows vickie
as the number starts to ring vickie hands the phone to jake
jake cant answer
whats this a joke
jake cant answer
well if theres somebody listenin their mothers a fuckin whore who takes it in the ass
there is a click as joey hangs up
jake stands there and finally hangs up the phone
jake gulps down the last of his scotch
continuing his monologue i shoulda never hit my brother
afterwards i was sorry
now every time i need somethin i gotta go shoppin for it
a psychiatrist once told me when you hit your brother youre really hittin your mother but you cant admit it to yourself
hes really crazy
i woulda never hit my mother
i mean only in self defense
a lot of people wanta know who was the best guy i ever fought
there was that one i fought twice
the other frenchman
you know who i mean
having trouble pronouncing the name dauthuille
he was tough but i beat him
i had to
i mean how would it sound losin to a guy whose name you cant even pronounce

i was talkin about sugar ray
some of you think i was better than him
but you know its a toss up
except the last fight
jake sips his drink
the anniversary of the st
robinson didnt use a machine gun but it was still a massacre
jake takes another drink
actually i was doin okay at first
in fact by the end of the fifth round i really had him worried he thought he killed me
lenore joeys wife watches the th robinson lamotta fight on joeys new television console
joey walks by on his way to another room but stops to watch
lenore is not a fight fan but is caught up in the fight anyway
look at that
the sonofabitch is outboxing robinson
i cant believe hes getting that jab in
the bell sounds and a pabst commercial comes on friend the quality that has carried pabst blue ribbon around the world is yours for the asking
next time that friendly bartender says whatll you have
give him the answer the whole world gives pabst blue ribbon
tony is wiping jake off in his corner
he aint hurting me but i cant get him down
keep at it
jab jab jab
youre ahead on points
in the other sugar rays trainer pats down robinsons pompadour as he says hes going sugar
he aint jake lamotta no more
make your move sugar
the bell sounds and the fighters step onto the canvas
they look at each other before the boxing starts they both know the inevitable outcome
robinson makes his move
his arms are a blur swinging rapidly but accurately
joey and lenore are suddenly silent
lamottas on queer street but hes still standing
robinson throws a right a left a right a right and a right again
how can lamotta stay on his feet
on the tv we see that robinson has jake up against the ropes
hes giving jake a pier six beating
its the fox fight for real
jakes face is so soaked in blood that its impossible to pinpoint the cuts
no man can take this kind of punishment
lamotta is just a rag doll now
god knows whats holding him up
this is an historic beating
sugar rav staggers lamotta with a left and comes across with a blackjack punch to the champions head
the referee is stepping in robinson has lamotta on the ropes
sugar ray robinson former welterweight champion has taken the middleweight crown from jake lamota
as the referee stops the fight joey sighs with relief
lamotta a bloody and beaten fighter walks over to the victorious robinson and puts his arm on his shoulder
you never knocked me down
you could never knock me down
robinson receiving congratulations from every direction takes time to turn to jake and say so what
the house is quite large and has beautiful landscaping and a swimming pool
jake wearing sportclothes that cant hide his paunch and vickie wearing a dress and looking her best sit in the living room with their three children the two boys and
also a girl about two years old
a still photographer clicks pictures of jake and vickie as two reporters talk with jake
im pulling out of next wednesdays tv bout cause i cant make the weight
im fighting at light heavyweight and i still cant make the weight
does that mean
it means im through with boxing
im tired with tryin to make the weight anymore

jake cuts in i also bought a club on collins avenue and im gonna open it real soon

jake an empty glass in his hand stands on the bar platform
hes wearing a white tuxedo jacket with a red rose in the lapel
his tuxedo shirt is stained
he continues his monologue
the anniversary of the st
valentines day massacre
robinsin didnt use a machine gun but it was still a massacre

i mean besides dont
then to piano player in the key of h
then to audience youre laughin
give me the right key and ill play in anybodys flat
i sing for a reason
when i finish youll be so sobered up well sell a lot of booze
jakes onstage version of thats entertainment differs from the backstage version
its not just that hes a little drunk no his voice is defiant sadly defiant
he is singing at the patrons rather than to them
when the fighters not engaged in his employment his employment although he was champ and quite the rage he must go somewhere else to seek employment seek employment
so what does he do
he goes upon the stage and meets his true adversaries all you members of the human race
but a fighters life is not a bowl of cherries still id rather have an egg than a fist upon my face
jake brings the band to a crescendo with a wave of his hand then silences it
the spotlight goes out and there is a hearty round of applause
jake receives the kisses glad handshakes and congratulations of the patrons as he works his way around the club
jakes new friends love him
they are party girls sports figures columnists mobsters b actors and other jake poses for a still with two buxom young lovelies
one girl giggles as he fondles her
after the flash goes off the girls admire his small delicate hands
jake steps over to a table and greets j
a newspaper columnist and his companions
glad you could make it
you were great jake
just like old times
good thing sugar ray wasnt here tonight
oh jake this is states attorney bronson and his wife
jake shakes his hand then holds it up showing an empty palm
joking sorry empty
oh i didnt mean that
if i dont give your husband no money he wont have enough to buy you a drink
to show you im a nice guy this ones on me
the last one was your payment for this month
bronson is embarrassed
he doesnt think the joke is funny but he manages a smile
his wife gives a nervous laugh
jake leans over and kisses her
youre a good sport lady
i saw you fight bob satterfield in jake
you were great
yeah i really cleaned up on him
wheres your wife jake
do you think id let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin around
jake feigns a few jabs and they all laugh
he walks off
as jake leaves j
whispers to his friend you ought to see his wife
jake steps over to a table where some of the boys are sitting
ricky is the miami version of salvy
hey ricky glad you came
wouldnt miss it jake
jake calls a waitress over
hey honey give these fellas a round on me
i can tell theyre gonna be regular customers
the waitress says to a clearly underaged girl ill have to ask for your i
jake leans over and gives the young girl a long kiss on the lips
she enthusiastically reciprocates
any girl that can kiss like that can drink in my club any time
they all laugh as jake moves on
the life of the party
jake hungover his tux wrinkled walks out of the club to the adjacent parking lot
vickie is sitting in her yellow cadillac outside the club
the curbside window is halfway up
she calls to him jake
jake chagrined steps over to the car
i had to work late last night
slept at the club
im leaving your jake
sure what else is new
this time its true
i didnt bother to tell you until i had everything worked out
jake tries to open the door
open the door vickie
i wont talk to you where you can use your hands on me
dont say that
i got a lawyer jake
were getting a divorce
im getting custody of the kids
aw cmon vick im sick of it
i cant watch you this way
youre too drunk all the time
theres too many girls
i dont wanna talk about it
i made up my mind
jake tries to reach in the window but vickie hits the power switch closing it and catching his hand
she now has to yell to him you got three days to get your stuff out of the house
after that the cops will be there
i have the kids with me
i never want to see you again
vickie turns her face and drives away
jake grabs at the cadillac but it is bigger and stronger than him
jake is left alone in the parking lot
the car is gone
jake has an office above the lounge
ever since vickie left its also been his apartment
the place is a mess
jake sends his laundry out when he runs out of clean clothes
dirty socks shorts and shirts are scattered randomly
empty whiskey bottles on the desk empty beer cans in the wastebasket
lets go jake wake up
whadda ya mean get up
showing badge were from
interrupting i know where youre from
you guys look the same every place
they wanna talk to you
i dont run the joint
they just told me to bring you in
cmon get dressed
jake hunts for his clothes
hey im a big tax payer down here
dont that entitle me to some information what this is all about
the second deputy shows jake a photo
you recognize this girl
she been in the club
she says you introduced her to men
i introduced a lot of people to men
what does that mean
close up of picture
jake wearing a suit walks up to the door and pushes the bell
vickie opens the door and looks at him over the chain
vickie open up
i need to come in
are you drunk
open the door
jake tries to touch her face through the doorway crack but she steps back
i wont bother you
im out on bail
you can send the kids next door
i just gotta pick one thing up then ill get outa here
vickie thinks a moment then opens the door and lets jake in
the kids are sleeping
i promise i just gotta pick up one thing
all right just dont make any noise
jake walks directly past vickie into the living room
vickie watches from a safe distance
jake removes his jewel studded championship belt from the glass bookcase and carries it into the kitchen
in the kitchen he takes a hammer and screwdriver out of a drawer places the belt on the counter top and starts digging the jewels out of it
vickie appears in the doorway
what are you doing
i need ten thousand dollars
my lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around we can get the case dropped
but they dont have a case against you
digging at the belt are you kiddin
did you ever see a year old testify in court
did you see the papers
lamotta on vice rap
everybody likes a shot at the champ
jake be careful
whatre you doing to the belt
dont make no difference no more
cant you get the money from your friends
jake frustrated by his task turns the belt over and hammers at it
the jewels scatter across the counter top and floor
jake collects the jewels and puts them in his pockets
jake stands at the counter of a small jewelry store
the jeweler examines the stones
didnt you also wish to sell the championship belt mr
those are the jewels that were in the belt
but wheres the belt
you want the jewels or the belt
these stones are worth about fifteen hudred dollars but the belt of a champion is a very rare item
the belt with the stones untouched would have been worth near five thousand dollars
jake seems to despair of the whole thing the belt the attempt to raise gs the vice case his life
jake places a call from a booth outside the jewelry store
on phone i cant raise the ten thousand
let em put me on trial
same as scene
jake years old continues to rehearse
he is seated across from a mirror
so there i am in the can
and not the one that says gentlemen on the door
im talkin about jail
i mean jail up north is gotta be like summer camp compared to jail down in cracker country
and if youre a guy like me you aint got a chance in a place like that
especially if youre italian
you come from the bronx
and youre an ex champ
as soon as they saw me
soon as they heard me
i know im in trouble
to me they got an accent and to them i got an accent
you gotta get the picture im big i got small hands i walk like im still in the ring
the balls of my feet pop up and down you know
and whenever i get the chance i read a lot
so naturally takin all this into co sideration they figure it adds up to one thing im queer
now i didnt mind too much when they called me queer or mr
tough guy or yankee punk
but one day these screws got to me
i was workin on the work gang pickin up some trees that were knocked down by a storm or somethin and puttin em on this truck
all of a sudden
one of the trees slipped and fell on me and pinned me to the ground
im lyin there with a tree across my chest
this screw walks over takin his time he looks down at me and says well champ pimp
you lyin down on the job again
they got a great sense of humor when theyre standin there with a gun in their arms and you got a tree on your chest
so i look up at him and say oh this tree
it fell on me
and he says oh im sorry
if id have known i wouldve yelled timber i said hey look
i think maybe i broke somethin
he says well whaddaya know
champ pimps got himself a boo boo
then i got as stupid as him
i said if im champ pimp
how bout givin me the money you made last night
then another screw comes over and says this yankee creep givin you trouble
what kind of trouble
what am i gonna do hit em with the tree
now anybody else in their right mind wouldve said no sir i wouldnt think of giving any of you gentlemen trouble
i just want to serve my time and get the hell out of here as soon as i can
thats anybody else
when i said it
it was a little different
you stupid cracker
take your hands off me or ill get up and kick your brains out but first you gotta bend over so i can find em
next thing i know im in the hole
all my life i had guys in my corner yellin go get em jake
youre the greatest
now theres nobody rootin for me
but it wasnt so bad
i learned things there
i learned how to scratch a calendar on the wall
i never knew how to do that before
now i know
monday is one scratch
tuesday is two scratches
wednesday is three scratches
and so on
except for sundays
sundays is no scratches
the camera tracks down the lonely corridors of the dade county prison
empty faces stare out from behind the bars
jake is led down a long corridor by two guards
his hands and legs are manacled and chained
the guards redneck screws both take special pleasure in working jake over
they take jake to the hole solitary confinement
one of the guards unmanacles jake
both guards push jake into the cell and slam the door
a thin slit provides the only light in jakes cell
the rough cement walls are covered with obscure graffiti

jake crouches into the corner away from the light

a pair of black arms come in and embrace her body
z close up of jake he reacts to this
hes in the ring with sugar ray
he knocks sugar ray out of the ring
aa vickie again
jake approaches her from behind pulls her head back by her hair and slaps her
bb the announcer points to sugar ray as the winner
camera pans to ray victorious his arms up
cc a bloodied jake comes over to sugar ray and embraces him
we are back with jake in the cell
he slowly starts to bang his head against the wall
murmuring why why why
with each bang of his head im a man im a man
im no faggot
im not a faggot
what do they want
my cocks not enough
what do they want from me
jake is now smashing the wall with all his strength vicious body punches
why why why me

they took everything away
what do they want from me
what the fuck do they want from me
i aint bad
i aint bad
im not that guy

jake breaks his knuckles the pain and blood are unbearable
jake collapses to the concrete floor
his hands are smashed
he cries then sobs
im not like that
im not like that
we begin to hear jake doing a monologue
and so as shakespeare said ive been down so low theres nowhere else to go
the metropole is a club on th avenue off times square
jake lamotta years old and wearing a hip fifties suit continues his monologue
except here gentlemen with you bums
i call you gentlemen
but you know what you really are
you know this place used to be pretty exclusive
now they got bouncers outside to throw the drunks in
my first night here i said to the boss wheres the toilet
he said youre in it
by the way this engagement is just a stepping stone for me
if i do good here im ready to get out of the business
the crowd starts to shout get the fuck off the stage
ok ok i know what youre waitin for and from the looks of you you been waitin for it for a long time
i had my own joint in miami beach once
it was too high class for you guys
we had a cent minimum charge just to keep out the riff raff
the crowd continues to shout as before also shouting bring out the girls
heres your girls
grabs his crotch yeah shes here
just like its advertised out front
shes come back
a girl whos seen the lower depths
whos been as far as i have in that direction
shes on her way back up now
give you an idea how low she was
lets give her a warm welcome
make her glad shes back boys
miss emma s
jake gets off the stage as miss emma s goes into her dance
he goes over to the bar and gets a drink
several older men in t shirts a disreputable looking lot are at the bar
the club is closing
jake and emma the stripper come out and walk by a delicatessen on their way to a parking lot
jake sees his brother joey enter the delicatessen
look sweetie be a good girl
heres some money
take a cab
go home by yourself
just wanna walk around a little sort of unwind
will i see you later
ill call you
jake goes to the parking lot entrance as emma gets into a cab
its about twenty minutes later
dolly into a medium shot of jake waiting by the parking lot
he looks at the delicatessen
joey finally comes out carrying a paper bag
not noticing jake he walks right past him to his car which is parked near the rear of the outdoor lot
hey joey jake walks towards joey with his hand outstretched
joey looks at jake
joey turns his back and starts to get into his car
jake runs over to joey and grabs his shoulder
no joey no
look wait a minute please joey looks at jake like hes shit throws jakes hand off his shoulder and starts to get into his car again
aw joey jake stops joey from getting into his car
he puts his hand on joeys shoulder again
youre perfectly right
you got every right in the world to hate my guts
joey pulls away from jakes hand and tries to put the paper bag into the front seat of the car
i know i was a cocksucker
i shoulda never raised my hands to you
joey half pushes jake away and begins to get into his car again
jake pulls joey by the arm
no joey listen to me jake pulls too hard causing joey to drop the paper bag to his feet
the containers of coffee and tea in the bag break open and splatter joeys pants legs
joey stares down at his pants then up at jake
suddenly he belts jake with a left and a right to the jaw
jake is taken by surprise and backs off to get his own hands up
joey keeps pouring it on
jake drops his hands and takes it
gets punched hit me again
gets punched i deserve it
gets punched pay me back
gets punched more
gets punched joey stops in mid punch and stares at jake
he cant figure it out
jake nods and tries to smile but starts to cry instead
go ahead joey
i deserve it
joey pauses then finally throws a very weak punch to jakes shoulder
he leaves his hand there then uncurls his fist and finally puts his hand around jakes neck as tears start to fill his eyes
joey hugs jake close to him crying
they hug each other both crying
they dont say anything
the theater lights are flashing
this may not be broadway but its a long way from the metropole
the entrance to the barbizon looks out on the corner of th avenue and central park south
a stand up billboard in front of the theater advertises an evening with jake lamotta
the billboard also lists the authors whose works will be performed paddy chayevsky rod serling shakespeare bud schulberg tennessee williams
same as scenes one and eighty one
jake is alone preparing to go onstage
you know im not a philosopher or anything like that but i been around a little and the way i look at it is were all of us lookin for
the same thing a shot at the title
no matter what you wanta be
you wanta shot at bein the best
well i had mine and itll always be in the record books
it dont make no difference what happens to me from here on in i got my shot and thats a fact
some guys werent that lucky
like the one marlon brando played in on the waterfront an up and comer whos now a down and outer
there was this scene in the back of the car with his brother charlie a small time racket guy and it went somethin like this it wasnt him charlie
it was you
you member that night in the garden you came down my dressing room and said
kid this aint your night
were going for the price on wilson
you member that
this aint your night
my night i coulda taken wilson apart
so what happens
he gets the title shot outdoors on the ballpark and what do i get
a one way ticket to palookaville
i never was no good after that night
it was like a peak you reach
then it went downhill
it was you charlie
you was my brother charlie
you shoulda looked out for me a little bit
you shoulda taken care of me just a little bit so i wouldnt have to take them dives for the short end money
you dont understand
i coulda had class
i coulda been a contender
i coulda been somebody instead of a bum which is what i am
lets face it
it was you charlie
a shadow goes by the frame its a stagehand
hey jake how you doing
the shadow exits
how long do i have
the shadow pops in again
about five minutes the shadow exits
jake pauses then starts to shadow box in his dressing room
his breath comes in quick gasps
his feet pop up and down like they were on canvas
his tiny fists jerk forward with short bursts of light
still a contender
a year old man fighting for his shot
the camera dollies into a full shot of his fists as they hit the empty air in and out of the frame
this quote appears music in verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he can not enter into the kingdom of heaven
john the camera goes into darkness
the end credits roll up
