written by deborah moggach a vast mansion is coming to life
maids pull dustsheets off furniture servants open shutters
sunshine spills into the great rooms of netherfield
outside a glimpse of rolling parkland
it is a truth universally acknowledged
its a whirlwind of activity
servants bustle around sweeping and polishing readying the house for its new occupants
the shutters of a room are opened onto the imposing gardens
a coach pulls up and through the window we see a young man get out
that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife a white sheet is pulled from a spinet and obscures our vision
elizabeth bennet good humoured attractive clearly nobodys fool walks through a field of tall meadow grass
she is reading a novel entitled first impressions
she approaches longbourn a fairly run down th century house with a small moat around it
elizabeth jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a wooden plank duck board a reckless trick learnt in early childhood
she walks passed the back of the house where through an open window to the library we see her mother and father mr and mrs bennet
my dear mr bennet have you heard that netherfield park is let at last
we follow elizabeth into the house but still overhear her parents conversation
do you not want to know who has taken it
as you wish to tell me i doubt i have any choice in the matter
as elizabeth walks through the hallway we hear the sound of piano scales plodding through the afternoon
she walks down the entrance hall past the room where mary the bluestocking of the family is practising and finds kitty the second youngest and lydia the precocious baby of
the family are listening at the door to the library
have you heard
a mr bingley a young man from the north of england has come down on monday in a chaise and four
with five thousand a year
jane the eldest most beautiful and most charmingly naive of the girls joins them at the door
and hes single to be sure
mr bennet is trying to ignore mrs bennet
what a fine thing for our girls
bow can it affect them
my dear mr bennet how can you be so tiresome
you know that he must marry one of them
oh so that is his design in settling here
mr bennet takes a book from his table and walks out of the library into the corridor where the girls are gathered mrs bennet following
mr bennet walks through the girls to the drawing room pursued by mrs bennet
so you must go and visit him at once
mr bennet walks to the bookshelf to replace the book he is carrying
mary is there practising the piano
the girls come in to listen
oh yes papa
there is no need for i already have
the piano stops
a frozen silence
they all stare
a how can you tease me mr bennet
you have no compassion for my poor nerves
you mistake me my dear
i have a high respect for them they are my constant companions these twenty years
is he amiable
is he handsome
hes sure to be handsome
with five thousand a year it would not matter if he had a big pink face
i will give my hearty consent to his marrying whichever of the girls he chooses
so will he come to the ball tomorrow
i believe so
lydia and kitty shriek with excitement
i have to have your spotted muslin please
i need it
if you do ill lend you my green slippers
mr bennet winks at elizabeth and turns to mary a serious somewhat pedantic young woman
and what do you say mary
are you not excited by the prospect of a ball
society has claims on us all papa
as long as i have my mornings to myself i consider an interval of recreation and a amusement as quite desirable
the local subscription dance is in full swing
its a rough and ready though enthusiastic affair
yeoman farmers small time squires with their ruddy cheeked daughters
lydia and kitty with their mother are fussing over their clothes straightening their dresses tidying their hair and so on
fussing over her dress i literally cant breathe its so tight
my toes hurt
elizabeth and jane are a little apart from their family
jane looks breathtaking
a well if every man in this room does not end the evening completely in love with you then i am no judge of beauty
oh they are far too easy to judge
they are not all bad
humourless poppycocks in my limited experience
one of these days lizzie someone will catch your eye and then youll have to watch your tongue
and eat my hat
she stops speaking
a dazzling group enters the room george bingley a good hearted soul but a prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusiasms get the better of him his sister caroline a
victim of every latest fashion counting herself superior to most company she encounters and finally mr fitzwilliam darcy dashing brooding with an introversion which could be misconstrued as hauteur
they are dressed in the highest fashion
darcy surveys the hall
he catches elizabeths eye
she stares with a kind of surprised shock
jane notices and looks at darcy
he turns away
luckily you are not wearing a hat
a hush falls as the local people turn to stare
the newcomers creatures from another world make quite a stir
caroline bingley standing next to darcy gazes at the somewhat provincial gathering with distaste
we are a long way from grosvenor square are we not mr darcy
he does indeed look superior to the assembled company
on the dance floor a young couple staring at the newcomers trip over each other stumble and burst out laughing
mr bingley spots jane bennet
for a moment he forgets himself and openly looks at her
i find it very charming
my brother is so easily pleased is he not
darcy does not answer
elizabeth has found her great friend charlotte lucas an intelligent sensible woman in her late twenties
they spy through the crowd
so which of the painted peacocks is our mr bingley
he is on the right and on the left is his sister
and the person with the disagreeable expression
that is his good friend mr darcy
on the contrary he has ten thousand a year and owns half of derbyshire
sir william lucas a hale but unsophisticated member of the self made gentry takes it upon himself to introduce mr bingley and mr darcy to his daughter charlotte and the
to mr bingley my eldest daughter you know mrs bennet
miss jane bennet elizabeth and miss mary bennet
it is a pleasure
i have two others but they are already dancing
delighted to make your acquaintance
and may i introduce mr darcy
of pemberley in derbyshire
a stiff bow from darcy elizabeth smiles darcy does not
elizabeth is standing in a small group with jane bingley miss bingley and darcy
bingley cant keep his eyes off jane but is frightfully at a loss in disguising his instant ardour
how do you like it here in hertfordshire mr bingley
smiling at jane shyly very much
the library at netherfield ive heard is one of the finest in the country
yes it fills me with guilt
he looks at jane a little blush starts around his collar
not a good reader you see
i like being out of doors
i mean i can read of his sister steps in
as the blush threatens to engulf his ears
your library at pemberly mr darcy is astonishingly good
it is the work of many generations
and then you have added so much to it yourself
i wish i read more but there always seems so many other things to do
thats exactly what i meant
he beams at jane
mr and mrs bennet stand a little apart from elizabeth and the other young people
lydia and kitty bound up to them in a state of high excitement
the regiment is arriving next week
and will be here for the whole winter
mrs forster told us
theyre going to be stationed in the village
mr bingleyturns to jane
may i have the honour
they leave to dance
do you dance mr darcy
not if i can help it
elizabeth darcy and miss bingley stand in silence as they over hear the following
lots of officers
how will we meet them
you just walk up and down in front of them and drop something
lydia pantomimes the actions for kitty
a they pick it up
you say oh thank you sir and blush prettily and then youre introduced
i have long suspected that we have two of the silliest girls in the county
oh mr bennet
i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself and if a smart young colonel with six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall
not say nay to him
mr darcy overhears this
profoundly embarrassed lizzie moves away
the dance floor
mr bingley is dancing with jane
his ears blushing with thrilled embarrassment
mrs bennet with a group of other mothers watches the young couple with rather too obvious satisfaction
that dress becomes her does it not
a though of course my jane needs little help from couturiers
elizabeth wanders through the throng
she looks at bingley and jane ending the dance she is coy and demure he clearly smitten darcy is joined by bingley exhilarated by the dance
come darcy i must have you dance
i hate to see you standing by yourself in this stupid manner
shakes his head you know how i detest it
upon my word ive never seen so many pretty girls in my life
you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room
oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but her sister elizabeth is very agreeable
they have stopped at the edge of the dance floor and have not seen elizabeth and charlotte who are standing close behind them
elizabeth smirks as she overhears their conversation
perfectly tolerable i dare say but not handsome enough to tempt me
elizabeths smile drops
you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me
bingley goes off
elizabeth and charlotte who have overheard darcy and bingleys exchange
ignore him lizzie he is such a disagreeable man it would be a misfortune to be liked by him
i would not dance with him for half of derbyshire
bingley politely dancing with charlotte
as he does so he catches sight of jane dancing with somebody else
a look of pure longing but he cannot dance every dance with her
lizzie too is dancing and clocks this
lydia and kitty are exuberantly dancing too laughing and chatting
darcy stands watching a look of infinitely superior boredom on his fine features
bingley is standing with jane elizabeth mrs bennet and darcy
your friend miss lucas is a most amusing young woman
i adore her
it is a pity she is not more handsome
but lizzie will never admit she is plain
of course its my jane whos considered the beauty of the county
oh mama please
when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman so much in love with her that i was sure he would make her an offer
however he did write her some very pretty verses
and so ended their affection
i wonder a who first discovered the power of poetry in driving away love
i thought that poetry was the food of love
of a fine stout love it may
everything nourishes what is strong already
but if it is only a thin slight sort of inclination im convinced that one good sonnet will starve it away entirely
darcy looks at elizabeth with surprise
a glimmering of interest
so what do you recommend to encourage affection
oh dancing of course
even if ones partner is barely tolerable
she gives him a dazzling smile
darcy looks startled
he has no idea she heard him
elizabeth is dancing happily in a round jane and bingley a are also in the same dance
at the edge of the dance floor darcy is watching
elizabeth and jane are both tucked up in the same bed but are too excited to sleep
mr bingley is just what a young man ought to be
sensible good humoured completing the list handsome conveniently rich you know perfectly well i do not believe marriage should be driven by thoughts of money
i agree entirely only the deepest love will persuade me into matrimony which is why i will end up an old maid
do you really believe he liked me lizzie
jane he danced with you most of the night
i was flattered i must admit
i did not expect such a compliment
that is one great difference between us
compliments always take you by surprise
well mr bingley is certainly very amiable and i give you leave to like him
youve liked many a stupider person
youre a great deal too apt to like people in general you know
all the world is good and agreeable in your eyes
not his friend
i still cannot believe what he said about you
i could more easily forgive his vanity had he not wounded mine
but no matter
i doubt we shall ever speak again
she blows out the candle
mrs bennet presides over breakfast with an endless description of the ball
mary is doing some needle work whilst lydia kitty and jane blearily eat
and then he danced the third with miss lucas
poor thing it is a shame she is not more handsome
the fourth with a miss king of little standing
and the fifth again with jane
a if hed had any compassion for me he would have sprained his ankle in the first dance
oh mr bennet
anybody would think the girls looked forward to a grand inheritance
elizabeth rolls her eyes at mr bennet theyve heard this speech many times before
kitty be so kind as to pass the butter
as you well know mr bennet when you die which may in fact be very soon our girls will be left without a roof over their head nor a penny
to their name
oh mother please
its ten in the morning
mrs hill enters the room and interrupts mrs bennets a babbling
a a letter addressed to miss bennet maarn
from netherfield hall
praise the lord
we are saved
mrs hill gives the letter to jane
make haste jane make haste
it is from miss bingley
mrs bennet is stopped in her tracks
she has invited me to dine with her
her brother will be dining out
this is most unfortunate
i didnt think he was so good looking anyway
can i take the carriage
certainly not my dear you will go to netherfield on horse back
mrs bennet leaves with a secret smile on her lips
jane rides through the countryside a distant rumble of thunder
she looks up
an open book
raindrops fall on it
drawing back we see lizzie walking through a field reading
she looks up to the sky
mrs bennet stands at the kitchen door
a boy is delivering meat
it starts to rain
she puts out her hand to check
smiles satisfied ah good
the housekeeper mrs hill who is with her looks bemused at her mistresss reaction
a louder rumble of thunder
a washerwoman hastily pulls clothes from a line
its bucketing down heavily now
in the local
village people run for cover shopkeepers cover up their wares
mr and mrs bennet look out at the pouring rain
now she will have to stay the night
exactly as i predicted
good grief woman
your skills in the art of match making are without question
though i dont think mama you can reasonably take credit for making it rain
lets hope she hasnt caught her death before she gets there
a footman opens the great doors to find jane standing there soaked
a elizabeth reads a letter
a and my kind friends will not hear of me returning home until i am better but do not be alarmed excepting a sore throat a
fever and a headache there is nothing wrong with me
this is ridiculous
well my dear if your daughter does die it will be a comfort to know it was all in pursuit of mr bingley
people do not die of colds
though she might well perish with the shame of having such a mother
mr bennet laughs
i am going to netherfield at once
nonsense the horse is with jane
and the girls took the carriage to town
then i will walk there
we should not leave jane alone in her condition
you will not be fit to be seen by the time you get there
why the devil not
we could have them all laid up at netherfield hall
i will be fit for jane which is all i care about
elizabeth strides across vast muddy fields slipping as she goes
netherfield is in view on the horizon
she stops to take it in then carries on down an even more muddy track
in the large grand dining room caroline bingley and darcy are eating breakfast
its very formal in fact frigid compared to the volatile bennet household
darcy is reading the a newspaper caroline bingley is reading a letter
puts down the letter apparently lady bathurst is redecorating her ballroom in the french style
a little unpatriotic dont you think
mr darcy is about to answer when the door opens
a footman appears his face rigid with disapproval
miss elizabeth bennet
lizzie comes in her face flushed her skirt covered in mud
she looks ravishing
darcy stares at her then quickly rises to his feet
caroline bingley astonished looks her up and down
good lord miss bennet
have you walked here
im so sorry
how is my sister
show miss bennet the way alfred
goodness did you see her petticoat
six inches deep in mud
and her hair so blowsy and untidy
i think her concern for her sister does her credit
a little pause caroline recovers
oh yes its shocking to have a bad cold
i dislike excessively being ill myself
netherfield landing day
i elizabeth is taken upstairs
bingley looking tense waits outside her sisters room
his face lights up when he sees her
oh im so glad to see you a doctor comes out of janes room
how is she
a violent cold but we shall get the better of it
elizabeth goes into the bedroom where jane lies in bed feverish and ill
janes face lights up
elizabeth kisses her
oh your face is so cold
theyre being so kind to me i feel such a terrible imposition
i dont know who is more pleased at your being here mama or mr bingley
bingley comes in having attended to the doctor
thank you for tending to my sister so diligently it seems she is in better comfort here than she would be at home
it is a pleasure i mean not to see her so sick of course thats terrible
i will have a room made up for you
you must be our guest here until jane recovers
darcy is quietly reading as bingley paces about anxiously
caroline berates him from the sofa
she is a perfectly sweet girl but save being an excellent walker there is very little to recommend her
i thought she showed remarkable spirit coming all this way
the eldest miss bennet as you know i hold in excessive regard and i wish her well settled
though i do fear with her families low connections there is little chance of it
their uncle is in trade you know in cheapside
if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside it would not make them one jot less agreeable
mr bennet is overseeing the gardener who is pruning the hedge
mrs bennet bustles up
she looks very pleased with herself
well my dear its all going according to plan
hes half in love with her already
a touch disingenuously who my sweetest
and he doesnt mind that she hasnt a penny for he has enough for the two of them
suddenly a distant trumpet sounds dogs bark
the militia are arriving
lydia and kitty rush past
they are dressed up to the nines to greet the officers
mrs bennets face lights up
a mrs bennet wait for me
and shes gone
mr bennet gazes at their departing a figures
mrs bennet and her two daughters rush down the street into the village
dogs bark children run alongside as a regiment of soldiers march through the street
geese scatter shopkeepers stand in their doorways
the two bennet girls simper at the handsome young soldiers
mrs bennet flushed and excited runs panting behind them
lydia deliberately drops her hankerchief
one of the soldiers stands on it
she is appalled
elizabeth is reading a book
darcy is writing a letter
bingley is sat nervously
caroline obviously bored wanders the room looking for distraction
she looks over darcys shoulder
you write uncommonly fast mr darcy
without looking up a you are mistaken
i write rather slowly
caroline bingley lingers annoyingly
how many letters you must have occasion to write mr darcy
letters of business too
how odious i should think them
it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of yours
please tell your sister that i long to see her
i have already told her once by your desire
lizzie looks across from her book
i do dote on her i was quite in raptures at her beautiful little design for a table
perhaps you will give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again
at present i have not enough room to do them justice
mr bingley now pacing anxiously around the room
its amazing how young ladies have the patience to be so accomplished
what do you mean charles
they all paint tables and embroider cushions and play the piano
i never heard of a young lady but people say she is accomplished
the word is indeed applied too liberally
i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen women in all my acquaintance that are truely accomplished
a caroline bingley nor i to be sure
you must comprehend a great deal in the idea
she must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word
and something in her air and manner of walking
and of course she must improve her mind by extensive reading
elizabeth closes her book
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women
i rather wonder now at your knowing any
are you so severe on your own sex
a i never saw such a woman
she would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold
darcy goes back to his letter
caroline bingley picks up a book
puts it down
she walks over to miss bennet let us take a turn about the room
lizzie surprised gets up
caroline bingley links her arm and they start walking up and down
its refreshing is it not after sitting so long in one attitude
and its a small kind of accomplishment i suppose
darcy meets lizzies eye briefly
he goes back to his letter writing
more walking up and down
caroline bingley turns to darcy
mr darcy will you join us
shakes his head you can only have two motives miss bingley and i would interfere with either
to lizzie archly what can he mean
our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it
please tell us
either you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage by walking
if the first i should get in your way
if the second i can admire you a much better from here
a caroline bingley oh shocking
how shall we punish him for such a speech
we could always tease him
oh no mr darcy is not to be laughed at
are you too proud mr darcy
and would you consider that a fault
that i couldnt say
for were trying to find a fault in you
maybe its that i find it hard to forgive the follies and vices of others or their offences against myself
my good opinion once lost is lost forever
a oh dear i cannot tease you about that
what a shame for i dearly love to laugh
a family trait i think
elizabeth smiles sweetly
miss bingley glances at darcy
elizabeth wakes up next to jane
darcy gallops through the countryside
darcy exhausted rides into the stable yard
in the corner is a trough and pump
he strides up to the pump puts his head under it and douses himself with cold water
a int ext
bedroom stable yard netherfield the same
from a window elizabeth looks out at darcy
darcy looks up and for a second catches elizabeth looking down at him
she turns from the window
jane is waking up
jane do you think you might feel well enough to leave today
the doors open
the butler as before a mrs bennet a miss bennet a miss bennet and a miss bennet sir
are we to receive every bennet in the country
mrs bennet lydia mary and kitty are introduced to caroline bingley and darcy
elizabeth holds her breath as her mother launches into untold gaucheries
what an excellent room you have sir
such expensive furnishings
i hope you intend to stay here mr bingley
absolutely i find the country very diverting
dont you agree darcy
i find it perfectly adequate even if society is a little less varied than in town
but i assure you there is quite as much going on in the country as there is in the town
indeed mania i think mr darcy merely meant there were not such a variety of people to be met in the country as there are in town which you must
acknowledge to be true
a mrs bennet nonsense we dine with four and twenty families
sir william lucas for instance is a very agreeable man
so very genteel and easy
mr bingley is it true that you have promised to hold a ball here at netherfield
it would be an excellent way to meet new friends
you could invite the militia
oh do hold a ball
trying to stop bingley being kitty
when your sister has recovered you shall name the day
i think a ball is a perfectly irrational way to gain new acquaintance
it would be better if conversation instead of dancing were the order of the day
indeed much more rational but rather less like a ball
thank you mary
to mrs bennet please let me show you to jane you will find her quite recovered
the bennets carriage awaits
the bingleys are gathered to see the bennets off
jane is radiant in the peak of health
to the bingleys really i dont know how to thank you
bingley beams bashfully
he cant take his eyes off her
really youre welcome anytime you feel the least bit poorly
thank you for such stimulating company
it has been most instructive
not at all
the pleasure is all mine
elizabeth looks at darcy who does not say anything
she gets in the carriage
they share a look as elizabeth joins the rest of the bennets in the carriage
the driver takes off
bingley waves enthusiastically to jane
the family are all squeezed in rather too tightly
what a high and mighty man that mr darcy is quite eaten up with pride
the bennets carriage is stopped in its tracks by the militia who are marching en masse through town
carriage meryton day
lydia cannot believe her eyes as row after row of soldiers pass by the carriage with not a few of the men looking in at the bennet girls with some
i cant believe it there must be a thousand of them
leading the one troupe of militia is wickham a very handsome blonde officer lydia spots him and swoons
to the coachman please drive on
as the bennet girls come into the house lydia eulogizing the militia they meet mr bennet
i hope my dear that you have ordered a good dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party
mr bennet holds up the letter
collins late twenties an overweening sychophant nervous and unctuous in equal measure
he sits in his black garb hunched uncomfortably as he comes through town
dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late father over the entail to me of the longbourn estate has long been a subject of much torment which i
have frequently wished to heal
having received ordination this easter and being so fortunately distinguished by the patronage of the right honorable lady catherine de bourgh
collins voice fades out as his carriage wipes through frame revealing elizabeth and charlotte on their way to the butchers
a his name is mr collins
hes the dreaded cousin
whos to inherit
he may leave us our stays but even my piano stool belongs to mr collins
he can turn us out of the house as soon as he pleases
because the estate is entailed to him and not to us poor females
a cart passes crammed with sheep going to slaughter
mr collins is ushered in by the manservant perkins
he looks around his future home with interest
mr and mrs bennet greet him
mr collins at your service
what a charming house
so convenient for the local village
looks at the furniture and some very fine pieces if im not mistaken
this is hardly tactful
jane lizzie and mary enter
ah these are your daughters are they not
we have some more somewhere
i must congratulate you
i have heard much of their beauty but in this instance fame has fallen short of the truth
a very low bow
the girls are somewhat taken aback
the bennets and collins are seated formally for supper
mr collins is served some food
what a superbly featured room and what excellent boiled potatoes
it is many years since i had such an exemplary vegetable
to which of my fair cousins should i compliment the excellence of the cooking
mr collins we are perfectly able to keep a cook
i am very pleased the estate affords such a living
i am honoured to have as my patroness lady catherine de bourg you have heard of her i presume
mrs bennet shakes her head
my small rectory abuts her estate rosings park and she often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies
lizzie catches her fathers eye
does she have any family
one daughter the heiress of rosings and very extensive property
i have often observed to lady catherine that her daughter seemed born to be a duchess for she has all the superior graces of a elevated rank
mr collins contd these are the kind of little delicate compliments that are always acceptable to i ladies and which i conceive myself particularly bound to pay
how happy for you mr collins to possess the talent for flattering with delicacy
mr collins nods with satisfaction
do these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are they the result of previous study
jane kicks elizabeth under the table
elizabeth tries not to laugh at mr collins answer
they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with arranging such little elegant compliments i always wish to give them as unstudied
an air as possible
believe me no one would suspect your manners to be practised
the girls look at one another
after dinner i thought i might read to you all an hour or two
i have with me fordyces sermons which speak eloquently on this point
do you know fordyces sermons miss bennet
later we can see the girls and mr bennet gathered by the fire through the doorway
mr collins leaves the room and takes mrs bennet aside to a very discrete conference out of hearing of anyone else
you do know i have been bestowed by the good grace of lady catherine de bough a parsonage of no mean size
a mrs bennet i have become aware of the fact
a well it
is my avowed hope that soon i may find a mistress for it and i have to inform you that the eldest miss bennet has captured my special attention
collins looks lasciviously into the room
mr collins unfortunately it is incumbent on me to hint that the eldest miss bennet is very soon to be engaged
but miss elizabeth next to her in both age and beauty would make anyone an excellent partner
do not you agree mr collins
mr collins looks through the doorway at elizabeth indeed
a very agreeable alternative
elizabeth and jane are walking towards the house when across the moat they see mr collins come out of the house and advance towards them
mx collins spots them and darts through a door in the garden wall and hurries towards the bridge to meet them
she pulls jane across the duck board spanning the moat through the house and out the front
mr collins doubles back and follows them into the house
the girls are no where to be seen
he looks around puzzled
a elizabeth and jane arrive in the village
jane forever the dutiful daughter looks uneasy elizabeth is flushed and reckless
she looks behind them
weve lost him
they slow down to a walk
and then stop
outside the milliners shop the incorrigible lydia and kitty are chatting to wickham the dashing young officer we spotted earlier
he is utterly gorgeous slim handsome tousled hair
the perfect romantic hero
she and jane join them
we just happened to be looking for some ribbon didnt we kitty
and we met mr wickham
he picked up lydias gloves
hes a lieutenant
shall we all look at some ribbons together
they come into the shop
the others go towards the counter
wickham hangs back and smiles a complicit witty smile at elizabeth
though i must warn you i have very poor taste
only a man truly confident of himself would admit that
no its true
my rooms in town decorated i thought in the height of a fashion have reduced grown men to tears of mirth
then why dont you change them
and deny people such pleasure
so you dont mind being laughed at
it is a somewhat sterile quality is it not to be aware of ones importance in the world
especially if like me one has none
elizabeth looks at him with interest
the moment is broken by lydia coming up
lizzie please lend me some money
you already owe me a considerable sum liddy
allow me to oblige
please mr wickham
wickham gives elizabeth a smile and moves away to the counter
the girls emerge from the shop with wickham
youre too generous
it all adds up
ill pay him back
ill make sure of that
elizabeth is really rather taken with him
they walk down the street
will you be stationed here all winter mr wickham
that depends on what the french have in mind
of course i look forward to action
smiles at her but on the other hand lizzie look
janes face lights up
it is indeed bingley riding towards them
he is accompanied by darcy
a bingley jumps off his horse and hurries over to jane
his open friendly face is filled with delight
i was on my way to your house
please mr bingley when are you going to give a ball
i was just waiting until your sister was quite well
elizabeth pays no attention to the following conversation instead she is looking at darcy who in turn is staring at wickham
they both obviously recognize each other and look very uncomfortable
as soon as they have made the white soup
be sure to invite mr wickham
darcy turns and rides off without a word
lydia you cant just say that will you excuse me ladies
enjoy the day
elizabeth looks at wickham puzzled
a small cards party is underway
three tables have been set up
elizabeth wickham jane lydia kitty charlotte and sir william and lady lucas are present
a small number of officers and other ladies are also present
we move around the tables
kitty is sat with sir william and charlotte and mary
jane sits at a table with mr collins and lady lucas
lizzie sits with lydia and two other officers
lydia flirts outrageously
we have asked mama if we might have new dresses for the netherfield ball
yes white they must be white
white is the only colour to be worn this season
so i believe
mr collins is at a table with lady lucas he glances over at elizabeth as he talks
of course when you understand that lady catherine de bourgh is its proprietor you will realise what an immense compliment that is
lady catherine spent eight hundred pounds on a chimney piece alone
a wickham who has been talking to some of the other officers comes and sits beside elizabeth passing by mr collins on the way
aside to elizabeth your cousin is blessed with an uncommon capacity for charm
elizabeth laughs and plays a hand
will you be attending the netherfield ball mr wickham
i hope to
how long has mr darcy been a guest a netherfield
elizabeth pounces on this reference to mr darcy and takes her chance
about a month
are you acquainted with mr darcy
indeed my fate has been very intimate with that gentleman
i have been connected with his family since infancy
elizabeth is genuinely surprised there is a pause while she is forced to play her hand
you may well be surprised miss bennet especially given the cold manner of our intimacy this afternoon
are you well acquainted with that gentleman
as much as i could ever wish to be
i have spent four days in the same house as him and i think him very disagreeable
i cannot pretend to be sorry
but really i speak out of turn
collins voice breaks the moment
miss elizabeth i was just saying to sir william what appalling weather weve been having
elizabeth cannot believe her misfortune in mr collins a but she smiles politely
i think i shall take a little air
she rises and walks through the room towards a balcony
as she passes the other tables we follow and witness snippets of their conversations
it seems mr wickham has met with universal approval
though lizzie looks singularly pleased with him
at the moment she has more suitors than sense
charlotte looks over at mr collins
elizabeth passes sir williams side of the table
now any one for a round of bridge
really i need to take some air
mr collins makes his way to join elizabeth
oh i am not so familiar with the game sir william
i insist that you join us
please mr collins id be happy if youd collins resigns himself to his fate
elizabeth smiles and slips out into the night air
elizabeth breathes in the cold night air
she senses someone join her
she looks round to see wickham has followed her as she had hoped
a i hope your plans in favor of meryton will not be affected by your difficult relations with the gentleman we were just speaking of
oh no it is not for me to be driven away
if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go not i
i must ask you mr wickham what is the manner of your disapproval of mr darcy
do you really want to hear
he ruined me
she stares at him
my father managed his estate
we grew up together darcy and i
his father treated me like a second son
oh he was the kindest of men and bequeathed me the best living in his gift for i had my heart set on joining the church
but when he died darcy ignored his wishes and gave the living to another man
why did he do that
out of jealousy for his father loved me more than he loved him
are you sure
and out of pride for he considered me too lowly to be worth his consideration
lizzie gazes at him with horror and sympathy
bedrooms longbourne the same
we pan through the bedrooms as the bennet girls prepare for the netherfield ball
kitty is helping lydia into her dress they are both wearing white
we move to the quieter preparations of jane and elizabeth
this conversation has been going on for some time
i still think there must have been a misunderstanding
oh jane do you never think ill of anybody
how could mr darcy do such a thing
i will discover the truth from mr bingley at the ball this evening
if it is not true let mr darcy contradict it himself
but until he does i hope never to encounter him
poor unfortunate mr wickham
on the contrary he is twice the man darcy is
and lets hope for you a rather more willing dancer
jane leaves elizabeth at the mirror taking very particular care of her makeup
she smil s to herself
a the great doors of netherfield open to reveal the ball in full swing
compared to the somewhat clod hopping assembly its a dazzling affair
there are hundreds of guests
all the women roughly two hundred are dressed in white
the men are either in red a officer uniform or dressed in black and white
there are a number of rooms each occupied by a different activity cards buffet womens closet
the final and grandest room is the ball room a swirl of elegant dance
the bennets enter the first reception room the girls including mrs bennet are all dressed in white
mr collins is slightly detained as people pass
mr bingley bounds up to jane
im so pleased
and so am i
how are you miss elizabeth
elizabeth is not paying attention instead she is searching over mr bingleys shoulder for a sight of wickham
are you looking for someone
a no no not at all
admiring the splendor of the ball
it is lovely mr bingley
bingley and jane move off leaving elizabeth with mrs bennet and others
while mrs bennet talks we focus on elizabeth searching the sea of red coats
refering to jane and i dare say i have never met a more pleasant gentleman in all my years
look how he dotes on her
still jane has always done what is best for her family
elizabeth takes this opportunity to slip away into the next room
elizabeth looks around but cannot see mr wickham
suddenly she thinks she sees him so starts to a r move over
the man turns round it is not wickham but someone else
elizabeth walks nonchanantly into the next room again looking for mr wickham
she cranes around trying to see a him then she is suddenly surprised by charlotte lucas
have you seen mr wickham
she shakes her head
perhaps he is in the ballroom
they both walk into the ball room
we pull back to reveal a sea of dancers
wickham is nowhere to be seen
jane appears and catches elizabeths arm
hes not here
apparently otherwise detained
the disappointment is palpable on elizabeths face
mr collins arrives breathless
he smiles eagerly at elizabeth
there you are
what a pleasant surprise
perhaps you will do me the honour miss elizabeth
i didnt think you danced mr collins
i do not consider it incompatible with the office of a clergyman to indulge in such an innocent diversion
elizabeth tries to smile politely
in fact several people her ladyship included have complimented me on my lightness of foot
elizabeths face is a matey rictus
a they dance the style of which is not unlike english country dancing
a to be sure dancing is of little consequence to me but it does afford the opportunity to lavishones partner with delicate attentions which is my primary object of the
elizabeth turns as part of the dance and for a moment she dances beside jane
apparently your mr wickham has been called on some business to town though my informer told me he would have been less inclined to be engaged had it not been
for the presence at netherfield of a certain gentleman
jane indicates towards where darcy stands watching them
that gentleman barely warrants the name
the dance leads elizabeth back to mr collins
it is my intention if i may be so bold to remain close to you throughout the evening
couples are preparing for the next dance
elizabeth and charlotte are standing to one side when mr darcy approaches
may i have the next dance miss elizabeth
elizabeth is stunned
darcy walks away
what was i thinking
have i no presence of mind
l i dare say you will find him very agreeable lizzie
that would be the greatest misfortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate
elizabeth dances face to face with darcy
neither can speak
they dance for a moment in silence
i do love a sarabande
they continue for a moment in silence
it is your turn to say something mr darcy i talked about the dance now you ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couples
i am perfectly happy to oblige please advise me of what you would like most to a hear
that reply will do for the present
perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones
but for now we may be silent
do you talk as a rule while dancing
we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with
all the eclat of a proverb
so a little lubrication to avoid embarrassment might be advantageous
i see no striking resemblance of your own character in this how near it is to mine i cannot say
beat tell me do you and your sisters very often walk to meryton
they are suddenly parted by the choreography of the dance
we stay with elizabeth who is whisked round the floor by an elderly man who smiles at her toothlessly elizabeth a looks back at darcy who is dancing with lydia
he stare at elizabeth as he dances
elizabeth smiles at her current partner in embarrassment
very mild weather weve been having
deaf as a post sorry
the dance spins again and she is back with darcy
yes we often walk to meryton it is a great opportunity to meet new people
in fact when you met us we had just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance
i will admit your mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends whether he is capable of retaining them is less certain
he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship
i remember hearing you once say that your resentment once created was unappeasable
you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created
may i ask to what these questions tend
to make out your character mr darcy
and what have you discovered
i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly
i hope to afford you more clarity in the a future
a they bow to each other and elizabeth moves quickly away from darcy
elizabeth is at the buffet watching kitty quaff a huge glass of wine and having the glass immediately refilled
she is joined by caroline bingley who also looks at kitty disapprovingly
let me recommend you as a friend not to give too much confidence to all of the assertions your friend mr wickham might make
he is indeed a charming man but one should never forget from where he is descended
his lack of trustworthiness and descent appear by your account to be the same thing please excuse my interterence it was kindly meant
a a breathless mr collins appears
is that mr darcy of pemberley in derbyshire
i believe so
but i must make myself known to him immediately
but sir he is the nephew of my esteemed patroness lady catherine
mr collins starts making his way determinedly towards darcy
please mr collins
hell consider it an
elizabeth watches from a distance with acute embarrassment as collins interrupts darcy
darcy does not notice him so collins raises his voice
the room around him stops
darcy is surprised and turns round
in dumbshow we see darcy is horrified by collins obsequiousness during the conversation collins points elizabeth out to darcy
what interesting relatives you have miss bennet
elizabeth walks away into another room
the other room where mary is singing badly at the piano
elizabeth is horrified
she turns to leave only to see mr bennet looking on
he winces as mary misses a high note
mary finishes the song with an off key flourish
mary smiles and prepares for another song
arent you going to do something
mr bennet walks over to the piano
mary dear youve delighted us long enough
but they asked for another song
mr bennet shuts the lid
let the other young ladies have a turn
charlotte and lizzie are sat together
perhaps my family have made a competition to see who can expose themselves to the most ridicule
well at least bingley has not noticed
they look over and see jane and bingley dancing
bingley clearly besotted by jane
i think he likes her very much
but does she like him
there are few of us who are secure enough to be really in love without proper encouragement
bingley likes her enormously but might not do more if she does not help him on
she is just shy and modest
if he does not perceive her regard he is a fool
we are all fools in love
he does not know her character as we do
she should move fast
snap him up
there is plenty of time for us to get to know them after were married elizabeth looks over the dancefloor to see lydia dancing with a soldier
shes a little drunk and very flirtatious
he says something she shrieks with laughter
elizabeth sits at the side of the dance floor
she looks at mrs bennet dancing in outrageous fashion
cut to later lydia is getting more and more leery with a group of soldiers elizabeth walks away in embarrasment only to see mr collins smiling at her from across
cut to elizabeth dancing joylessly with the excruciating mr collins as she turns in the dance she sees darcy look on with obvious disdain
cut to much later the band are exhausted guests are leaving
the staff are asleep on their feet
elizabeth almost alone watching her parents dancing almost the only people left on the dance floor kitty is asleep over elizabeths lap
this is a never ending nightmare
day light creeps through the curtains
mrs bennet is sprawled on a sofa
lydia completely drunk
jane sitting demurely
collins looking longingly at elizabeth
mrs bennet is holding court whilst the footmen behind are literally ready to drop
bingley is standing the perfect host but obviously willing the a bennets to leave
i have never had such a good time in my life
mr bingley you must have such a ball once a month at least
caroline who is standing with her brother yawns ostentatiously
i really think it is time to go
dont be impertinent
our hosts are perfectly happy with our company are you not mr bingley
i hope i can entice you to longbourn to sample our hospitality
we would make sure you had or courses at least
she holds out her glass for a top up and carries on
so tell me mr bingley
whom did you like least of all your guests this evening
this is enough
darcy looking down at elizabeth from a staircase
he turns and walks away
the bennets are squeezed into their carriage
it is light outside
only mrs bennet is awake but the lack of an audience does not stop her from talking
allowing for new carriages dresses etcetera etcetera
we will be having a wedding here at netherfield in less than three months if you ask me
breakfast room longbourne day
the bennets eat in silence
mrs bennet moans she is hungover
mr collins comes in in a state of agitation
they look at him
he sits hesitates then
is mr collins mrs bennet i was hoping if it would not trouble you that i might solicit a private audience with miss elizabeth in the course of the morning
elizabeth is open mouthed
certainly lizzy would be very happy indeed
please go ahead
no time like the present
mr collins would like a private audience with your sister
everyone looks in amazement
i beg you
mr collins can have nothing to say to me
that anybody need not hear
i desire you will stay where you are
everyone else to the drawing room
a mr bennet but
mrs bennet makes sure everyone leaves winks at mr collins then shuts the door before elizabeth has time to do anything
elizabeth looks at mr collins who looks at her in earnest
there is a horrible pause of intense embarrassment
dear miss elizabeth you can hardly doubt the purpose of my discourse
my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken
almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life
elizabeth stares at him astonished
but before i am run away with my feelings perhaps i may state my reasons for marrying
firstly that it is the duty of a clergyman to set the example of matrimony in his parish
mr collins contd secondly that i am convinced it will add greatly to my happiness and thirdly a that it is at the urging of my esteemed patroness lady catherine
that i select a wife
we here a kick and kitty screach from behind the door
my object in coming to longbourn was to choose such a one from amongst mr bennets daughters for as you know i am next in the entail of the estate
and such an alliance will surely make amends for this
drops to his knee and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affections
mr collins and that no reproach on the subject of fortune will cross my lips once we are a married
you are too hasty sir
you forget that i have made no answer
i must add that lady catherine will thoroughly approve when i speak to her of your modesty economy and other amiable qualities
sir i am honoured by your proposal but regret i must decline it
momentarily taken aback but i know ladies have their pretty little ways and dont seek to seem too eager in some desperation mr collins i am perfectly serious
you could not make me happy and im convinced im the last woman in the world who could make you happy
a mr collins i flatter myself cousin that your refusal is merely a natural delicacy
besides you should take into account that despite your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made to you rising deeply
affronted mr collins so i must conclude that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females
i am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man
please understand me i cannot accept you
elizabeth storms out of the room and out of the house
mrs bennet crashes in through another door hot on the tail of elizabeth
the headstrong foolish thank you but
we shall have this little hiccup dealt with immediately mr collins
mrs bennet goes chases after elizabeth
mr collins watches through a window as elizabeth is chased by her mother
mrs bennet marches into the library
mr bennet looks up in shock
oh mr bennet
we are all in a uproar
you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him
mr bennet starter at mrs bennet blankley
mr collins mr collins has proposed to lizzie
but lizzy declares she will not have him and now the danger is mr collins may not have lizzy
and what am i to do
mrs bennet drags mr bennet to his feet
speak to lizzy
they march to find elizabeth
mr bennet and mrs bennet confront elizabeth who has been waiting in the hallway
perhaps the other girls form an audience from the stairs mr collins looks on sheepishly from the breakfast room
tell her that you insist upon them marrying
you will have this house
i cant marry him
youll save your sisters from destitution
go back now and say youve changed your mind
think of your family
you cant make me
mr bennet say something
so your mother insists on you marrying mr collins
yes or i shall never see her again
from this day on you must be a stranger to one of your parents who will maintain you when your father is dead
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do
thank you papa
elizabeth turns around and walks into the drawing room
elizabeth enters the drawing room
in the drawing room mary is trying to read through the family din
jane sits very still
her face is white
theres a letter in her hand
mrs bennet charges in lydia and kitty in tow and speaks to anyone who will listen
oh ungrateful child
i shall never speak to her again
not that i have much pleasure in talking to anybody
people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no inclination for talking
nobody can tell what i suffer
she jabbers on but her voice fades
were with jane re reading the letter
whats wrong jane
close on janes pale face
shes staring at the letter
but it is always so
those who complain are never pitied
bingley caroline and darcy sit grimly in a carriage which drives off
darcy looks severe and stern caroline cant help a little smirk on her face
bingley looks back longingly
elizabeth and jane in bed
i dont understand
what would take him from netherfield
why would he not know when he was to return
a i have no reserves from you
jane passes elizabeth the letter
mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and we are scarcely less eager to meet her again
i really do not think georgina darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments so much so i must hope to hereafter call her my sister
it is my duty to indulge you in no hope in this respect for your own self
is that not clear enough
miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and is gone with him to persuade him otherwise
but i know her to be incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone
a he loves you jane
do not give up
go to our aunt and uncles in london
let it be known you are there and i am sure he will come to you
jane is in a carriage
mrs bennet kisses her goodbye through the window as all the bennets look on
give my love to my sister
and try not to be so much of a burden dear
janes carriage moves away and the family wave
mr bennet talks to elizabeth
however a girl likes to be crossed in love now and then
it gives her something to think of and a sort of distinction among her companions
im sure that will cheer her up papa
its your turn now lizzie
since youve turned down mr collins youre free to go off and be jilted yourself
what about mr wickham
he is a pleasant fellow and would do the job credibly
thank you but a less agreeable man would satisfy me
we must not all expect janes good fortune
still its a comfort to know that whatever might befall you you have an affectionate mother who will be sure to make the most of it
a small smile from elizabeth
elizabeth is making the bed and tidying janes belongings
there is a knock at the door and charlotte enters
my dear elizabeth ive come here to tell you the news
a what news
mr collins and i are engaged to be married
a stunned pause
you dont mind do you
tries to recover of course not
he asked for my hand this morning
and i accepted him
elizabeth looks quite faint
charlotte sits on the bed
elizabeth after a pause sits down beside her
i can see youre surprised coming so soon after his wishing to marry you
im not a romantic you know
i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collins character and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most
people can hope for
and thats all you expect
for women in our situation what choice is there
dont speak like that charlotte
a to become an old maid at best tolerated at worst a burden dependent on the kindness of others
or to seek the protection of marriage
and we only have two choices
an appalled silence
elizabeth gazes at her closest friend
charlotte has recovered herself
she now looks cool and composed unnervingly so
you can still change your mind charlotte
shakes her head im twenty seven years old
we hear the sound of the militia drums
the militia are leaving meryton
hundreds of soldiers and officers in the red coats marching out of the village to the sound of pipes and drums
the villagers are out to bid them farewell
lydia and kitty run through the crowds very distraught
they find elizabeth coming in the other direction
its too dreadful
theyre leaving for brighton
all of them
they got the call this morning
not a word of warning
elizabeth searches the red coats for wickham
she spots him he glances across at her she gives a pathetic wave and hes gone
lydia and kitty chase the last of the officers leaving elizabeth alone
she walks into the post office
the postmaster hands a letter to elizabeth
elizabeth opens it and reads it
bad news miss
it could not be worse
i have been invited to possibly the very last place on earth i would like to go
elizabeth comes out of the post office to reveal
time has passed the now deserted village is covered in a thick blanket of snow
a lonely elizabeth walks away totally despondent
charlottes new home is a smallish but charming rectory in kent
charlotte greets elizabeth kissing her warmly
a mr collins bows as he ushers her in
welcome to our humble abode
there is a coop containing hens of various descriptions
a vegetable patch
a rose bower
charlotte and mr collins are showing elizabeth round the place
and from here we have a good view of rosings park where we are honoured to dine at least twice a week
her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us
i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several
my dear i think our guest is tired after her journey
come on lizzie lets get some tea
a my wife encourages me to spend as much time in the garden as possible for the sake of my health
lizzie glances at charlotte who remains impassive
i plan many improvements of course
points to house i intend
to throw out a bow there and plant a lime walk
sharp look at lizzie oh yes i flatter myself that any young lady would be happy to be the mistress of such a house
a tiny nod from elizabeth
she understands perfectly
lizzie and charlotte are at last alone
they sit down with a certain relief in a charming little parlour that faces the front of the house
charlotte pours out tea
a we shall not be disturbed here for this parlour is for my own particular use
oh lizzie its such a pleasure to run my own home
a flash of understanding between them
charlotte jumps up and rushes to the window
has the pig escaped
lizzie joins her at the window
outside in the lane mr collins stands bowing at a carriage
its all right
its just lady catherine
they both burst out laughing
just for a moment the a atmosphere is eased
tell me how are things concerning mr wickham
elizabeths face changes
i have not heard from mr wickham since the regiment left for brighton but i am informed by lydia who keeps a breast of all matters military that he does
we hear mr collins rushing back into the house and running up the stairs
he comes into the room breathlessly excited
a we have an invitation to visit rosings this evening from lady catherine de bourgh
elizabeth is not overcome with enthusiasm
do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel
just put on that which is best among your clothes and lady catherine will not think the worse of you
elizabeth charlotte and mr collins walk hurriedly across the lawns towards the great house
beyond the toparied hedges the grey building looms ominously above them
it is grand without being elegant
one of the most extraordinary sights in all europe is it not
the glazing alone cost upwards of twenty thousand pounds
mr collins charlotte and elizabeth are led up a vast stairway which is painted with visions of hell
elizabeth stops in front of a painting of a devil
she stares at it it seem to speak but she realizes the voice is collins chiding her
as the devil this way
the salon at rosings is spectacularly grand hideously so
heavy furniture rows of servants
the three guests are shown in by the footman
again mr collins scrapes the floor with his bow
to the daughter miss de bourg
lady catherine is a haughty bossy woman
pretty a unspeakable really
her daughter is a sickly irritable looking creature
so you are elizabeth bennet
i am your ladyship
looking her up and down hmm
indicates her daughter this is my daughter
its very kind of you to ask us to dine lady catherine
lady catherine ignores her
whispers to lizzie the chimneypiece alone cost a
but lizzie doesnt hear
darcy walks into the room
when he sees lizzie he too falters and recovers himself
another man fitzwilliam is with him
a mr darcy
what are you doing here
another deep bow i had no idea we would have the honour
a stiff bow from darcy who looks at mr collins as if hes something brought in by the dog
he turns to lizzie trying to collect himself
im staying here
you know my nephew
yes madam i had the pleasure of meeting him in hertfordshire
darcys friend fitzwilliam a much more easy going chap introduces himself
a colonel fitzwilliam
how do you do
lizzie returns his smile gratefully
they move towards the dining room
mr collins leans towards lizzie
you know mr darcy is as good as engaged to miss de bourg
miss bingley will be disappointed to hear that
looks at the girl and whispers to charlotte what a sickly cross little thing
oh yes they should suit each other very well
charlotte smiles back a little fearfully
shes more intimidated by rosings than elizabeth is and indeed has more at stake
dining room rosings night
f the dining room is laid for a very grand dinner footmen waiting thousands of candles
lady catherine seats herself at the head of the table
the guests wait for their orders
you sit there and you sit there
you cant sit next to your wife
after some awkward shuffling around they all sit down
lizzie much to her discomfort finds herself sitting next to darcy
there is a pause
i trust your family is in good health miss bennet
they are thank you
my eldest sister is currently in london perhaps you happened to see her there
i havent been fortunate enough no
lizzie looks at him
he colours slightly
lady catherine addresses lizzie in a loud voice from the head of the table
do you play the pianoforte miss bennet
a little maam and very poorly
do you draw
no not at all
your sisters do they draw
that is very strange
but i suppose you had no opportunity
your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of the masters
my mother would have no objection but my father hates london
a has your governess left you
we never had a governess
mr collins squirms in embarrassment
darcy watches elizabeth keenly
five daughters brought up at home without a governess i never heard such a thing
your mother must have been quite a slave to your education
cant help smiling at this not at all lady catherine
are any of your younger sisters out
what five out at once
a and you only the second the younger ones out before the elders are married
your youngest sisters must be very young
yes my youngest is not sixteen
but i think it would be very hard on younger sisters not to have their share of amusement because the elder is still unmarried
and to be kept back on such a motive
it would hardly encourage sisterly affection
upon my word you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person
pray what is your age
with three younger sisters grown up your ladyship can hardly expect me to own to it
lady catherine looks astonished
mr collins shifts in his seat
mr darcy glances sharply in fact admiringly at lizzie
shes enjoying herself
dinner is over and they are drinking coffee
darcy moves towards elizabeth but lady catherine interrupts by shouting from her seat
come miss bennet and play for us
no i beg you for music is my delight
in fact there are few people in england who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or better natural taste
if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient
so would anne if her health would have allowed her
please i told you i play poorly a mr collins come come elizabeth her ladyship demands it
lizzie reluctantly sits down at the piano and starts to play
lady catherine takes no notice and talks loudly over the music
how does georgina get along darcy
she plays very well
i hope she practises
no excellence can be acquired without constant practice
i have told mrs collins this
turns to charlotte though you have no instrument of your own you are very welcome to come to rosings and play on the piano in the housekeepers room
thank you your ladyship
a you would be in nobodys way you know in that part of the house
darcy flinches at her bad manners
he moves away to the piano where lizzie is playing not that terribly well it must be said
a moment passes
you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all your state to hear me but i wont be alarmed even though your sister does play so well
i am well enough acquainted with you miss bennet to know i cannot alarm you even should i wish it
they eye each other warily
colonel fitzwilliam joins them
what was my friend like in hertfordshire
a you really care to know
the colonel nods
prepare yourself for something very dreadful
the first time i saw him at the assembly he danced with nobody at all even though gentlemen were scarce and there was more than one young lady who was
sitting down without a partner
i knew nobody beyond my own party
true and nobody can be introduced in a ballroom
come here and talk to us
fitzwilliam moves away
darcy and elizabeth are alone
i do not have the talent of conversing easily with people i have never met before
maybe you should take your aunts advice and practice
lizzie turns away from him and carries on playing
darcy gazes at the curve of her neck
she plays a false note stumbles and grimly carries on
elizabeth is writing a letter in the drawing room
she starts dear jane
the doorbell rings in the background she thinks nothing of it and continues
the maid opens the door to the drawing room and mr darcy enters
an awkward pause
please do be seated
im afraid mr and mrs collins are gone on business to the village
what on earth does mr darcy want
he paces up and down
this is a charming house
i believe my aunt did a great deal to it when mr collins first arrived
i believe so and she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful another pause
mr collins seems very fortunate in his choice of wife
he is indeed lucky to have found one of the few sensible women who would have accepted him
darcy sits down
shall i call for some tea
the sound of the front door and voices
darcy jumps up
good day miss bennet
its been a pleasure
he bows to her and leaves
elizabeth sits there bemused and intrigued
charlotte in the hallway taking off her bonnet
darcy hurries past her with a swift bow and leaves abruptly
charlotte gazes after him in surprise
a charlotte heads to the drawing room where she finds elizabeth sitting bemused
what on earth have you done to poor mr darcy
i have no idea
she truly doesnt
charlotte gives elizabeth a look sunday service is over and worshippers are leaving the church
mr collins in his vestments obeises himself to lady catherine who is sweeping out with her miserable looking daughter and downtrodden governess
elizabeth joins colonel fitzwilliam
they walk down the path together
how long do you plan to stay in kent colonel
as long as darcy chooses
i am at his disposal
i do imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly to have someone to order around
i wonder he does not marry and secure a lasting convenience of that kind
she would be a lucky woman
darcy is a most loyal companion
from what i heard on our journey here he recently came to the rescue of one of his friends just in time
darcy waylaid by various people comes out of the church
his eyes search for elizabeth
he sees her with fitzwilliam and hesitates
mr collins steps up to him and engages him in conversation
elizabeth stops at the churchyard gate
he saved the man from an imprudent marriage
who was the man
his closest friend
did mr darcy give you his reasons for this interference
there were apparently strong objections to the lady
what kind of objections
her lack of fortune
i think it was her family that was considered unsuitable
so he separated them
i believe so
i know nothing else
elizabeth grows pale
she turns to look at darcy who is joined by his aunt
i wish mr darcy and all his friends well in finding partners suitable to their very high standards
good morning col
elizabeth see that collinses are still busy with their parishioners and slips away
darcy sees her from a distance
lizzie walks across the park anywhere she hardly cares
she is in a turmoil of misery and fury
how could darcy do such a terrible thing
it starts to rain
a a grecian summer house by the lake
the rain is now bucketing down
lizzie hurries into the summer house and sits down heavily on a bench
her poor sister lizzie gazes in despair at the rain lashed landscape
a man approaches across the park
he draws nearer
hes hurrying towards her
sodden breathless he comes into the
he is in a state of agitation far too agitated to notice her upset face
miss bennet i have struggled in vain but i can bear it no longer
the past months have been a torment
he pauses unable to speak
elizabeth stares at him in astonishment
he struggles on
i came to rosings with the single object of seeing you
i had to see you
a ive fought against my better judgement my familys expectation
the inferiority of your birth
my rank and circumstance
all those things
but im willing to put them aside
and ask you to end my agony
i dont understand
i love you
elizabeth stares at him
please do me the honour of accepting my hand
elizabeth struggles with the most painful confusion of feeling
finally she recovers
sir i appreciate the struggle you have been through and i am very sorry to have caused you pain
believe me it was unconsciously done
gathering her shawl she gets to her feet
is this your reply
are you laughing at me
are you rejecting me
im sure that the feelings which as youve told me have hindered your regard will help you in overcoming it
a terrible silence as this sinks in
neither of them can a move
at last darcy speaks
he is very pale
might i ask why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus repulsed
trembling with emotion i might as well enquire why with so
evident a design of insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your better judgement
if i was uncivil that was some excuse believe me i didnt mean but i have other reasons you know i have
do you think that anything might tempt me to accept the man who has ruined perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister
darcy looks as if hes been struck across the face
do you deny it mr darcy
that you separated a young couple who loved each other exposing your friend to the censure of the world for caprice and my sister to its derision for disappointed hopes
and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind
i do not deny it
how could you do it
because i believed your sister indifferent to him
a i watched them most carefully and realized his attachment was much deeper than hers
thats because shes shy
bingley too is modest and was persuaded that she didnt feel strongly for him
because you suggested it
i did it for his own good
my sister hardly shows her true feelings to me
pause takes a breath i suppose you suspect that his fortune had some bearing on the matter
i wouldnt do your sister the dishonour
though it was suggested what was
it was made perfectly clear that an advantageous marriage
did my sister give that impression
an awkward pause
there was however i have to admit
the matter of your family our want of connection
mr bingley didnt vex himself about that
no it was more than that
pause very uncomfortable it pains me to say this but it was the lack of propriety shown by your mother your three younger sisters even on occasion your father
he has hit home
darcy paces up and down
you and your sister i must exclude from this
darcy stops and gazes at her
he is in turmoil
elizabeth glares at him in a blaze of fury and misery
and what about mr wickham
what excuse can you give for your behavior to him
you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns
he told me of his misfortunes
oh yes his misfortunes have been very great indeed
you have ruined his chances and yet treat him with sarcasm
so this is your opinion of me
thank you for explaining so fully
perhaps these offences might have been overlooked if your pride had not been hurt my pride
by my honesty in admitting scruples about our relationship
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your circumstances
and those are the words of a gentleman
from the first moment i met you your arrogance and conceit your selfish distain of the feelings of others made me realize that you were the last man in the
world i could ever be prevailed upon to marry
darcy recoils as if slapped
a terrible silence
forgive me madam for taking up so much of your time
he leaves abruptly
elizabeth watches him stride away through the rain
what has she done
she bitterly bursts into tears
elizabeth comes in soaked to the skin
charlotte runs to her
i was caught somewhat off guard
charlotte attends to elizabeth
who has changed and is drying her hair a shawl around her shoulders
shall i call the doctor
charlotte i shall be quite all right
please give lady de bourgh my apologies
you must not keep her waiting
mr collins clatters up the stairs
popping his head around the come on
we shall be late
charlotte leaves reluctantly and goes downstairs
later the sound of the front door closing
elizabeth sits down heavily on the bed
she walks downstairs and enters the drawing room
elizabeth is in the drawing room she looks at a book on the table
it is fordyces sermons
she puts it down and walks to the mirror and stares at herself
after a moment suddenly darcys face appears
they stare at each other without speaking
i came to leave you this
he places a letter on the table behind her
elizabeth does not turn but watches him through the mirror
im not going to renew the sentiments which were so disgusting to you but to address the two offenses you have laid against me
i had not long been in hertfordshire before i saw that bingley preferred your eldest sister
i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i have ever witnessed in him
elizabeth cannot bring herself to look at darcy
she stares at her own reflection as he speaks
yet when i observed your sister
detected no symptom of peculiar regard and witnessed only the families coarse appetite for having their daughters married favorably
and so in london perhaps erroneously i persuaded him of the unfitness of the match citing your sisters coolness towards him
we zoom in on elizabeths reflection
it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you appear naturally insufficient they were done to protect a friend
as to the other a more serious matter
as elizabeth turns she realises darcy has gone
darcys voice carries
my father provided for mr wickham a valuable living
elizabeth tears open the envelope her hands shaking and reads the letter as darcys voice carries on
but upon his death however mr wickham told me that he had no intention of taking orders and would i recompense him to the tune of a so he could
go to town and study the law
we circle elizabeth as she reads
this i did though by now i had some doubts about his character
these were confirmed by reports that he had sunk into a life of idleness gambling and dissipation
the money was soon used up whereupon he wrote demanding more money which i refused whereupon he severed all holding the letter she looks out of the window to see
darcy riding away
but last summer he was unwillingly obtruded on my notice when he connived a relationship with my sister whom he persuaded to be in love with him and made her
consent to an elopement
she was but fifteen
darcy rides off
mr wickhams prime objective was her inheritance of thirty thousand pounds but hope of revenging me was a strong inducement
i was lucky enough to persuade my sister of her folly
i hope this goes someway to mitigating my behaviour in your eyes
if you doubt my word please have it confirmed by my cousin fitzwilliam
drawing room hunsford later day elizabeth with the letter
charlotte walks in
elizabeth is shaking
lizzy are you alright
i do not know
i hardly know myself
elizabeth looks at charlotte utterly shaken
elizabeth riding in a carriage through cheapside reading the letter
as we shall never meet again i wish you all happiness in the future
elizabeth looks out at the high warehouse building and the bustle of trade
there is no horizon
gardiners house cheapside day
mrs gardiner the girls kindly aunt is taking elizabeths coat from her
how fortunate you are here just in time to catch everybody coming through from longbourn
how is jane
mrs gardiner smiles sadly
she is outside
through a window elizabeth sees jane sitting quietly alone at her needle work
elizabeth and jane sit together in the small walled garden
jane is all smiles but behind her eyes is a sadness unseen before
elizabeth is desperate to unburden herself a but feels unable
i am quite over him lizzie
if he passed in the street i would hardly notice
london is so diverting
what with the theatre and
but tell me what news from kent
everything as you might imagine
elizabeth tries to smile
there is a crash as all the bennets arrive at the house
kitty rushes into the garden crying her eyes out she is followed by lydia and mrs bennet
lizzie tell mama tell her
mrs forster has invited me
why didnt she ask me as well
kitty whats happened
because she likes me better
ive just as much right as lydia oh if i could but go to brighton and more so because im two years older
elizabeth looks to jane
lydia has been invited to brighton with the foresters
a a little sea bathing would set me up very i shall dine with the officers every night
an anguished wail from kitty
im sure i cried for two days when colonel millars regiment went away
thought i should have broke my heart
are you all mad
she glares at them deeply upset by them by everything
elizabeth has found a quiet corner with her father
please papa dont let her go
lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little inconvenience as
under the present circumstances
with great emotion if you dear father will not take the trouble to check her she will be fixed forever as the silliest and most determined flirt who ever made
her family ridiculous
and kitty will follow as she always does
we shall have no peace until she goes
really angry now peace
is that all you care about
colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is far too poor to be an object of prey to anyone
father its dangerous
im sure the officers will find women better worth their while
let us hope in fact that her stay in brighton will teach her her own insignificance
at any rate she can hardly grow any worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life
elizabeth gazes at her father will nothing touch him
he gave up on his daughter long ago
for this just now she hates him
no wonder our family is treated with contempt
she leaves tears stinging her eyes
her father looks puzzled at her outburst
mr bennet follows elizabeth in
well at least the house will be quieter
i dont wish to be stuck with such a foolish family any longer with your constant talk of men and marriages
surely there is more to life
lizzie dear you would be very welcome to accompany us
we plan to journey through the peak district
youd be most welcome
oh the glories of nature
what are men compared to rocks and mountains
believe me men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity
and if theyre amiable theyre so easily led that they have no minds of their own whatsoever
take care my love that savours strongly of bitterness
no they bring nothing but heartache
as usual elizabeth and jane share a bed
they lie next to each other in the darkness i saw mr darcy when i was in rosings
why did you not tell me
did he mention mr bingley
he did not
elizabeth has never felt more alone in the company of her sister
a ravishing landscape of savage and romantic beauty scudding clouds mountains wild rocky outcrops
elizabeth is walking freely the wind in her hair
as she nears the peak of a promontory mr and mrs gardiner are below making their way towards her
they smile at her
she strides off determined to reach the very top
when she gets there she stands with her arms outstretched her head back laughing into the wind
the view is magnificent
she breathes deeply
an establishing shot of lambton a charming market town
through the window of an inn we see elizabeth and mr and mrs gardiner at a table
in the inn the gardiners and elizabeth are eating supper
an air of high spirits
at the next table another amiable tourist couple are also tucking into their food
a indicating her husband hes been taking the waters at buxton
hasnt done him a jot of good
but weve had a fine time havent we dear
weve visited chatsworth dovedale pemberley
just two miles from here
close very close on lizzies face
one of the best houses in the country
arent you acquainted with the owner mr a darcy
well we shall go there tomorrow lizzie
i would rather stay here
i must own that im tired of great houses
all those carpets and curtains
but you liked chatsworth
if it is anything like mr darcy i am sure i will not be able to bear it
come come lizzie
the grounds alone are worth a visit
let us not make a fuss
if the girl does not want to go there is little point in persuading her
elizabeth is preparing for bed
the chambermaid fills her washbowl and starts to leave
i hear that pemberley is not far from here
you see something of the owner do you in town
not for some months madam for hes still in london i believe
close on elizabeths face
n the carriage enters the gates of pemberley
im so glad you changed your mind
elizabeth is alert her eyes bright with curiosity
the parkland is wild and rocky
deer graze rooks wheel in the sky
a sense of freedom and liberation
as the carriage drives over the top of a hill close on elizabeths face
the gardiners gasp
a huge wide shot of pemberley house
its vast breathtakingly beautiful set in great boulder strewn park lands
a mansion built of golden stone glowing in the sunlight
elizabeth walks through the magnificent grounds
imagine being mistress of all this
it is as big as all cheapside
elizabeth is lost in admiration
elizabeth and the gardiners are being taken on the tour by the housekeeper mrs reynolds who witters on in the background with descriptions of each room
elizabeth is apart and we witness the exquisite house from her point of view
a book lies open on a reading desk elizabeth turns it over to read the title
they walk through room after amazing room a breath taking library an unbelievable staircase
the huge picture gallery
elizabeth is apart from the rest looking at the pictures she stops by a painting of darcy
she looks at it thoughtfully but is interrupted by mrs reynolds and the gardiners who are following her
this is my master mr darcy
a handsome face
lizzie is it a true likeness of him
does this young lady know mr darcy
only a little
and do you not think him a handsome man miss
yes yes i suppose he is
mrs reynolds moves the gardiners on to another painting but elizabeth stays staring at darcys image
and this is his sister miss georgians
she plays and sings all day long
we realize that in the distance we have heard music
elizabeth is still gazing at the portrait of darcy then suddenly snaps out of her reverie as she processes mrs
a they are at home
miss darcy is always down for the summer
mr darcy is due here tomorrow
is your master much at pemberley
not as much as i would wish sir or he for he dearly loves it here
relaxed again elizabeth wanders off as the gardiners talk to mrs reynolds
if he should marry you might see more of him
yes madam but i do not know when that will be
i do not know a lady who is good enough for him
what do you mean
ive known mr darcy since he was a boy
he was always a kind and generous person even then
not everyone can see it because he does not make a meal of it like a lot of young men nowadays
but he is the most sweet tempered and kind hearted man i have ever known
as the gardiners look at more paintings elizabeth drifts out through the open doors and onto a terrace
in the bright sunlight the view of the gardens and valley beyond is exquisite
outside the music we heard before is louder
elizabeth wanders aimlessly across the terrace being unconsciously drawn by the music
suddenly elizabeth recognizes the tune perhaps it is one she has played earlier but this time it is played exquisitely
she follows the music round a corner intrigued as she gets a closer and closer to its source
she finally realizes she is outside the room where the music is being played
she steals herself a moment but her curiosity gets the better of her and she discretely peeps in
through the window she sees georgina darcy a beautiful fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and fluency
she is moved by the music and listens
after sometime then someone steps into her view but is mostly hidden by shadows in the room
he is directly behind georgina and gently puts his hands over her eyes
georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly
she stands and kisses the figure the sunlight hits his face
it is darcy
georgina and darcy kiss
elizabeth is stunned to see him there
darcy glances up and sees elizabeth watching him
for a moment they both stare at each other frozen with surprise
georgina starts in fright at the figure elizabeth turns and runs
darcy comes out after her
elizabeth stops appallingly embarrassed
darcy catches up with her
they both blush deeply
i thought you were in london
another ghastly silence
then they both speak at once
i came here a day early we wouldnt have come some business with my im so terribly sorry they stop
he gazes at her with great emotion
im visiting derbyshire with my uncle and aunt
trying to recover and are you having a pleasant trip
tomorrow we go to matlock
are you staying at larnbton
at the rose and crown
she extends her hand
im so sorry to intrude
they said the house was open for visitors
i had no idea
she shakes his hand and starts to walk away
may i see you to the village
im very fond of walking
goodbye mr darcy
she hurries away
he gazes after her
now she is out of sight lizzie collapses on a log
she is utterly undone
around her the birds sing
its that night
lizzie comes downstairs for supper
through a gap in the door to the restaurant she sees mr darcy talking to her aunt and uncle
i shall send my carriage at noon after a moment darcy leaves and elizabeth approaches the table
lizzie ive just met mr darcy
why didnt you tell us you had seen him
hes asked us to dine with him tomorrow he was very civil was he not
a not at all like you painted him
to dine with him
there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks
you dont mind delaying our journey for another day
elizabeth shakes her head dumbly
he particularly wishes you to meet his sister
a footman escorts elizabeth and the gardiners through the stupendous library
from the drawing room the sound of a piano playing
its the same music elizabeth played at rosings but this time played very beautifully
elizabeth is filled with trepidation we can almost feel her heart racing
the footman opens the double doors to reveal the magnificent drawing room
darcy is there
so is the dreaded miss bingley
seeing her elizabeths polite smile falters
darcys sister georgiana plays the piano
she jumps up and hurries over
my sister miss darcy
they smile and bob
georgiana is a friendly sweet girl
miss elizabeth my brother has told me so much about you
i feel as if we are friends already
what a beautiful instrument
my brother gave it to me
smiles at him he shouldnt have
a yes i should
oh very well then
shes easily persuaded is she not
they gaze at each other with affection
miss bingley approaches
what a surprise miss bennet to see you in derbyshire
your brother is well i trust
he hopes to come here soon
significant glance at pemberley has a special attraction for him
yes the library is particularly splendid is it not
a small silence
darcy uneasy at their conversation approaches
and how is your family miss bennet
someone told me the militia are removed from meryton
they must be a great loss for some of you darcy comes to the rescue
your uncle is fond of fishing i hear
drawing her away can you persuade him to borrow a rod this afternoon
for the lake here is very well stocked and its occupants left in peace for far a too long
elizabeth smiles surprised and delighted
and grateful to be rescued
what does mr darcy mean by this
she moves away to speak to her uncle
miss bingley moves closer to darcy
in six months i have never seen anyone so altered
how brown and coarse she has become
i perceive no alteration except she is rather tanned
hardly a miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer
i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire you said she a beauty
i would have as soon called her mother a wit
you must have mis heard caroline
even had i thought it i would have couched it with a little more finesse
elizabeth looks across at darcy they smile at each other
darcy is driving elizabeth and the gardiners back to lampton
the rugged landscape looks even more beautiful and dramatic in the dusk light
elizabeth sits up with darcy who holds the reins while mr and mrs gardiner sit comfortably in the carriage
mr gardiner smiles broadly at two large fish that lie beside him
it is so beautiful up here
i will be sorry to leave
darcy smiles at her
you have been a most gracious host
im sure my aunt and uncle will talk of nothing else for days
i have recently thought a great deal about how i appear and act to others
she smiles softly at darcy
it does you credit sir
the party arrive back at the inn
quietly to elizabeth what a capital fellow
thank you so much mr darcy
darcy is about to take his leave when a servant brings elizabeth a letter
for you madam
its from jane
a she rips open the letter
elizabeth is crying with the open letter in her hand
darcy and mr and mrs gardiner stand dumb not quite knowing what to do
elizabeth tries to speak but bursts into tears again
she cries for a long time
she cries on
she eventually gathers herself
it is the most dreadful news
lydia has run away with mr wickham
they are gone together from brighton to lord knows where
she has no money no connections i fear she is lost forever
a quietly to elizabeth this is my fault if only i had exposed wickham when i should
no this is my fault
i might have prevented all of it by merely being open with my sisters rather than too proud with my knowledge
mr and mrs gardiner look at each other perplexed
has anything been done to recover her
father has gone to london
but i know very well that nothing can be done
we have not the smallest hope
would to heaven that anything could be said or done on my part that could offer consolation to such distress
sir it think it is too late
i am afraid we must go at once i will join mr bennet and find lydia before she ruins the family forever
i am so very sorry
this is grave indeed
i will leave you
darcy pauses at the door looks back at elizabeth and then is gone
the gardiners carriage racing through the night
elizabeth jane mary and kitty are gathered around mrs bennet who has taken to her bed
why did the foresters let her out of their sight
i always said they were unfit to have charge of her
and now she is ruined
you are all ruined
who will take you now with a fallen sister
poor mr bennet will now have to fight the perfidious wickham and then be killed
he hasnt found him yet mama
and the collins will turn us out before he is cold in his grave do not be alarmed mama
our uncle is helping in the search
lydia must know what this will do to my nerves such flutterings and spasms all over me
were looking directly down onto a london street
mr bennet stands still against the passing pedestrian traffic
he tries to address a passer by
they ignore him
he tries again excuse me im looking for
mr bennet takes out a piece of paper
mr bennet walks timidly into the mess hall
it is smoky drunken noisy boisterous and extremely threatening
mr bennet stops at the threshold gulps then the whole room turns round to look at him and a sudden silence descends
mr bennet is terrified
his voice breaks up he clears his throat i am looking for a mr a wickham
elizabeth and jane are outside mrs bennets room
from inside we hear a moan
we are ruined
how long is this going to go on for
dont be too harsh
this is hard for all of us
they walk downstairs
elizabeth and jane walk into the drawing room
kitty and mary are busying themselves
i cant bear not hearing anything
the girls rush into the library
mr bennet slumps at his desk
who is to fight wickham and make him marry lydia now youve come home
for gods sake let me be
lizzie help me with my boots
elizabeth pulls off his boots for him
you suppose them to be still in london
where else could they be so well concealed
oh father im so sorry
a its been my own doing
you mustnt be too severe on yourself
let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame
i am not afraid of being overpowered by the experience
it will pass away soon enough
were looking through a window to the stairwell of a seedy looking boarding house
an anonymas pair of mens boots appear climbing up the stairs
we move across the exterior wall of the building to find an open window through which lydia and wickham can be seen
lydia and wickham sit snuggled close beside the fire in their room in a humble lodging house
theyre eating a meal with relish
giggling lydia feeds him a mouthful
a knock at the door
they freeze like naughty children
the girls have a letter
kitty grabs it from jane mary grabs it from kitty before she has a chance to open it jane grabs it from mary
its to daddy
its in uncles writing
mr bennet snatches the letter
as it is addressed to me
he tears it open and begins to read squinting because he has forgotten his glasses
hes found them
are they married
squinting at the letter just wait
i cant make out his script
elizabeth snatches it
give it to me
she reads are they married
they will be if father will settle a hundred pounds a year on her
that is wickhams condition
a hundred pounds
you will agree to this father
the letter is passed around the other girls
of course i will agree
but how much your uncle has laid on this wretched man already is anybodys guess
what do you mean father
no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as a hundred a year
ah i see
your uncle is very generous
do you think it a large sum
wickhams a fool if he takes her for less than ten thousand pounds
i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship
mr mrs bennets bedroom longbourn day
it close on mrs bennets face as she springs out of bed
pure triumphant joy
and at sixteen too
ring the bell kitty
i must put on my things and tell lady lucas
oh to see her face
and tell the servants they will have a bowl of punch
the other bennets are assembled
we should thank our uncle mama
and so he should help
hes much richer than us and he hasnt got any children
how can you talk like that
her mother gets to her feet
a daughter married
is that all you think about
mrs wickham how well it sounds you dont know what hes like now where will they live
purvis lodge might do
ashworth is vacant of course but its too far off i couldnt bear to have her ten miles from me before you take any of these houses mrs bennet let
us be clear
into one house she will never be welcome
mrs bennet stares at him
hallway longbourn day
lydias triumphant face
the cat thats got the cream
she comes into the house with wickham
her mother kisses her effusively
mr bennet coldly bows
and then we passed sarah sims in her carriage so i took off my glove and let my hand just rest on the window frame so she might see the
ring and then bowed and smiled like anything
kitty shrieks with envy
lizzie moves away she cannot bear it
wickham catches her eye but she ignores him
they are taking their seats for dinner
lydia moves to the head of the table
jane i take your place now and you must go lower for i am the married woman
she sits down and giggles at her sisters
the maid brings a in the food
lydia holds up her hand to display her ring to the maid
you must all go to brighton for that is the place to get husbands
i hope you have half my good luck
wickham looking uncomfortable
hes talking to the stony faced mr bennet
ive been enlisted in a regiment in the north of england sir
l f g mr bennet im glad to hear of it
we shall travel there next week
a can i come and stay with you
that is out
of the question
lydia rattling on to lizzie
well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i dont want to hear there was my aunt preaching and talking away just as if she was reading
a sermon she was horrid unpleasant cant you understand why
but i didnt hear a word because i was thinking of my dear wickham
i longed to a know whether he would be married in his blue coat
mary turning to wickham
the north of england i believe boasts some spectacular scenery
lydia burbling on to a stony faced lizzie
and then my uncle was called away from the church on business and i thought who is to be our best man if he doesnt come back
lucky he did come back or i would have had to ask mr darcy mr darcy
claps her hand to her mouth i forgot
i shouldnt have said a word
mr darcy was at your wedding
he was the one that discovered us
he knew where to find wickham you see
but dont tell anyone
he told me not to tell
lizzie stares at her
darcy at her wedding
lydia turns away to talk to the others
lydia croquet mallet in hand drags her new husband across the lawn
come on wickham
youve got to play
yes come on
wickham looks slightly abashed a trapped man
what has he let himself in for
lizzie comes into the garden looking for her younger sister
wickham detaches himself and comes over to her
a rueful smile
i hope we can be even better friends now were brother and sister
an attempt at a twinkling smile but elizabeth is now immune to his charm
she nods briefly
i hear you visited pemberley
my dear old home
i met mr darcys sister
did you like her
looks at him we found a great deal to talk about
wickham looks deeply uneasy
he bows and leaves
lizzie watches him pick up a mallet and take his turn
she cant bear it she hurries up to lydia and draws her aside
why was mr darcy there
im not supposed to tell
lizzie abandons her pride
she takes lydias hand
because he paid for it
the wedding wickhams commission
its your turn
lydia moves to go
people kept saying wickham owed them money it was so tedious
so darcy settled his debts but i dont really like him do you
lizzie pulls her back
but why did he do it
i dont know do i
anyway youre not to tell because its supposed to be our uncle who paid and he wouldnt have a minded paying either because im his favorite
a she leaves
giggles and shrieks from the croquet lawn
elizabeth looks blank with shock
close on darcys grimly determined face
drawing back we see that he is walking down a street in mayfair
he arrives at a house pauses and rings the bell
the door is opened
i have some business with mr bingley
darcy goes inside and the door shuts
the camera cranes slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor window and into the drawing room
mr darcy enters and bows to mr bingley
he starts to talk in earnest
bingley looks stunned by what darcy is relaying to him
we witness the dumbshow of darcy confessing that he has wronged jane bennet
lydia and wickham are leaving
mr bennet stands at a distance
mrs bennet sobs as lydia climbs onto the carriage
write to me often my dear
wickham takes his leave of elizabeth
please relay my affections to the darcys on your next acquaintance
i am sure he will be pleased to hear things have worked out so well
he joins lydia
through the window married women never have much time for writing
my sisters may write to me
theyll have nothing else to do
the mrs bennet and the girls watch as the carriage drives away
oh there is nothing so bad as parting with ones children
one seems so forlorn without them
that is the consequence of marrying a daughter
it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single
elizabeth and jane are out shopping with their mother and sisters
their housekeeper mrs hill comes out of the butchers shop
did you hear the news madam
mr bingley is returning to netherfield
a stunned silence
lizzie glances at jane
mrs hill indicates a woman in the butchers shop
mrs nichols is ordering a haunch of pork for she expects him tomorrow
not that i care about it
mr bingley is nothing to us and im sure i never want to see him again
no we shall not mention a word about it
comes back to mrs hill is it quite certain he is coming
i believe he is alone his sister remains in town
come along girls
their mother goes into the drapers shop
jane pauses at the threshold
its all right lizzie
im just glad that he comes alone because then we shall see less of him
not that im afraid of myself but i dread other peoples remarks
a brave smile
lizzie of course is not convinced in the slightest
they go into the shop
mr bingley rides towards longbourn a look of slight trepidation in his eyes
darcy now comes into view riding along side him
they cross the moat bridge
mary is practising her scales
jane and elizabeth are sitting at their work with their mother
kitty rushes in
he is here
he is here hes at the door
oh my goodness
everybody act naturally
jane completely freezes
everybody else goes into a fluster
whatever you do do not appear overbearing
kitty looks out through a window
theres someone with him
mr whats his name
the pompous one from before
elizabeth looks through the window at darcy her heart leaps to her mouth
mr darcy indeed
the very insolence of it
what does he think of coming here
elizabeth returns to her seat and sits down heavily
mrs bennet hurries over to jane and pinches her cheeks
a to mary who is still stop that and sit down
find yourself some work
they sit there frozen pretending to sew
the drawing room door opens and mrs hill shows in the two men
bingley smiles warmly at jane who blushes
elizabeth glances at darcy
his face is strained
mrs bennet is all smiles for bingley
she ignores darcy
how very glad we are to see you mr bingley
there are a great many changes since you went away
miss lucas is married and settled
and one of my own daughters too you will have seen it in the papers though it was not put in as it ought to have been
very short nothing about her family
i did hear of it and offer my congratulations
but its very hard to have my lydia taken away from me
mr wickham has been transferred to newcastle where ever that is
thank heaven he has some friends
mrs bennet shoots a frosty glance at mr darcy
this is more than elizabeth can bare
do you hope to stay long in the country mr bingley
just a few weeks
for the shooting
when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please
thank you mr bennet will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of a the covies for you
are you well mr darcy
quite well thank you
well i hope the weather stays fine for your sport
i return to town tomorrow
my jane looks well does she not
mr bingley stands up abruptly
she does indeed
well i must be going i suppose
darcy darcy cannot quite believe it
he gives bingley a harsh stare bingley has not completed his task
it was very pleasant to see you all again
elizabeth miss jane
bingley can almost not bear to look jane in the eye as he acknowledges them all very briefly and bolts for the door
mrs bennet fusses around him
you must come again
for when you were in town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us
i have not forgot you see
at least three courses
bingley and darcy take their leave leaving the bennets sitting in silence all looking at once another
kitty is fit to burst out laughing elizabeth and jane horrified by the awkward visit
a bingley is pacing backwards and forwards in despair muttering to himself
darcy looks at him in extreme frustration
oh damn damn buggery damn
what were you thinking of
its as if bingley has not heard
he keeps pacing up and down
damn and blast oh buggery damn
the girls are now spread around the room
well im glad thats over
we can now meet as indifferent acquaintances
jane take care
you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now
i think you are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever
im sorry though that he came with mr darcy
oh jane i have acted so stupidly
had i been in love i could not have been more blind
what do you mean
the door bell rings
at the window it is him
hes come again
a a stunned reaction
everyone has regained their decorous positions
they hear bingleys voice at the door and he comes in very awkwardly
his face is crimson with embarrassment
i erm i know this is all very embarrassing but i would like to request the privilege of speaking to miss jane they all look at him
everybody to the kitchen
oh mr bingley
it is so good to see you again so soon
she ushers everyone out not before squeezing janes hand
now jane and bingley are alone facing each other with extreme embarrassment
miss bennet you have been the victim of a huge misunderstanding
suffice to say i have been an unmitigated and comprehensive ass
and therefore i would like to ask you mrs bennet kitty mary and mr bennet are all jostling for a position at the door in order to overhear events inside
elizabeth is apart from her family
she cannot bear to be there
she walks down the corridor and out of the house into the garden
through a window she sees bingley on one knee her eyes fill with tears as she walks away from the house
a bingley looks at jane desperately worried
a hundred times yes
mrs bennet and the girls throw open the double doors to the drawing room and come crashing in
bingley and jane beam at them
thank the lord for that
i thought it would never happen
elizabeth is sat under a tree crying
darcy looks down at longbourn
mr bennet and mrs bennet are in bed
i am sure they will do well together their tempers are much alike
they will be cheated assiduously by their servants and be so generous with the rest they will always exceed their income
exceed their income
he has five thousand a year
i knew she could not be so beautiful for nothing
the camera moves through to another bedroom where mary is reading a book out loud to kitty then to yet another jane and elizabeth lie in bed
he has made me so happy
you know he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring
how did he account for it
he thought me indifferent
no doubt poisoned by his pernicious sister
that is the most unforgiving speech youve ever made
oh lizzie if i could but see you so happy
if there were such another man for you
there is a noise outside
perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time
what is that
more noise it sounds like a carriage then a loud banging on the door downstairs
the girls look at each other
mr bennet mrs bennet and the girls lit by only candles have gathered
the door bangs again
maybe hes changed his mind
timidly mr bennet opens the door revealing a wide eyed lady catherine de bourgh
lady catherine does not acknowledge her but comes in uninvited inspecting the assembled company of aghast bennets
to mrs bennet and these are your daughters i suppose
all but one the youngest has been lately married your ladyship
and my eldest was only proposed to yesterday afternoon
you have a very small garden madam
a i am sure it is nothing compared to rosings but it is larger than sir william lucass i can assure you
could i offer you a cup of tea perhaps
i must speak to miss elizabeth alone as a matter of complete urgency
the bennets all look at each other bewildered by this strange turn of events
elizabeth leads the way into the drawing room lights an oil lamp
lady catherine walks in
the door closes behind them
you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand why i am here
a lit only by the oil lamp lady catherine resembles a flickering ghoul
indeed you are mistaken
i can not account for this honour at all
miss bennet i warn you i am not to be trifled with
a report of a most alarming nature has reached me that you intend to be united with my nephew mr darcy
elizabeth stares at her amazed
i know this to be a scandalous falsehood though not wishing to injure him by supposing it possible i instantly set off to make my sentiments known
if you believed it impossible i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far
to hear it contradicted miss bennet
your coming here will be rather a confirmation surely if indeed such a report exists
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it
has it not been industriously circulated by yourself
i have never heard of it
and can you declare there is no foundation for it
i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship
you may ask the questions which i may not choose to answer
this is not to be borne
has my nephew made you an offer of marriage
your ladyship declared it to be impossible
let me be understood
mr darcy is engaged to my daughter
now what have you to say
only this if that is the case you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me
oh obstinate girl
this union has been planned since their infancy
do you think it can be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to his family
whose own sisters elopement resulted in the scandalously patched up marriage only achieved at the expense of your uncle
heaven and earth are the shades of pemberly to be thus polluted
now tell me once and for all are you engaged to him
i am not
and will you promise never to enter into such an engagement
i will not
and i certainly never shall
allow me to say the arguments which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged
you have insulted me in every possible method and can now have nothing further to say
i must ask you to leave immediately
elizabeth throws open
the door revealing the family outside
i have never been thus treated in my entire life
lady catherine storms past the family and out into the night
elizabeth is standing shaking with the excitement of having stood so firmly up for herself
lizzie what on earth is going on
just a small misunderstanding
she walks past them to bed
for once in your life
just leave me alone
everyone looks aghast at elizabeths reaction
jane is fast asleep
elizabeth unable to sleep
she quietly climbs out of bed and creeps out of the room
elizabeth sits alone downstairs thinking
outside we see dawn is breaking
elizabeth creeps out into the garden and wanders around through the early morning mist as the sun starts to rise
elizabeth walks out into the open countryside
the mists are starting to evaporate
from out of the mist in the distance a figure emerges
her heart misses a beat
she is alone vulnerable
then she sees it is darcy
what are you doing out here so early
i could not sleep
i have been up
most of the night
elizabeth hardly knows how to react at this unexpected meeting
rather politely she thanks mr darcy
mr darcy i must thank you for your unexampled generosity to both my sisters
i know what kindnesses you have done for poor lydia and suspect your hand in the happy resolution for jane also
i am alarmed that you know of what i have been so in earnest to keep silent
but you must know that your happiness was one of my prime inducements
elizabeth looks at darcy
i know you are too generous to trifle with me
i believe you spoke with my aunt last night and it has taught me to hope as i had scarcely allowed myself before
if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once
my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me forever
elizabeth is silent
if however your feelings have changed
elizabeth gazes at him
i would have to tell you you have bewitched me body and soul and i love and love and love you
and never wish to be parted from you from this day on
elizabeth looks at him
she does not say a word
darcy is staring at her for a reply
a tear rolls down elizabeths cheek
i am very happy to inform you that not only have my sentiments changed there are no other words which could give me greater pleasure
darcy stares at her
they both start to cry
darcy very very slowly and gently touches her face
she closes her eyes
she touches his face with her hand the kiss becomes passionate
the place is in an uproar
bingley jane mary kitty mr and mrs bennet are all gathered fretting terribly about elizabeths whereabouts
through a window we see elizabeth lead darcy along the duck board plank across the moat
elizabeth enters the house everybody starts
lizzie where have you been
we thought something had happened to you
darcy follows elizabeth in
what on earth are you doing here
elizabeth takes mr darcys hand
mr darcy has come to speak with papa
everyone is stunned
hallway library longbourn day
elizabeth paces outside the door of the library waiting
after a while darcy emerges he gives elizabeth the briefest of smiles and leaves the door open
elizabeth walks in
her father is in a state of shock
lizzie are you out of your senses
i thought you hated the man
he is rich to be sure and you will have more fine carriages than jane
but will that make you happy
have you no other objection than your belief in my indifference
none at all
we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of fellow but this would be nothing if you really liked him
tears in her eyes i do like him
i love him
hes not proud
its i whos been prejudiced who didnt realize
you dont know him papa
if i told you what hes really like
what hes done
what has he done
darcy in an agony paces up and down the lawn
he looks at the library window
library longbourn day
mr bennet stares at his daughter
i must pay him back
shakes her head no you mustnt tell anyone
he wouldnt want it
we misjudged him me more than anyone
in every way not just in this matter
ive been so blind
hes been so blind
about jane about so many things
then so have you see he and i are so similiar
were both so stubborn
mr bennet gazes at his daughter
he still cant quite take it in
you do love him dont you
a very much
he looks at her earnestly searching her face
he loves his daughter very deeply
what he sees leaves him in no doubt
i cannot believe that anyone can deserve you but it seems i am over ruled
so i heartily give my consent
elizabeth jumps up and puts her arms around him
i could not have parted with you my lizzie to any one less worthy
oh thank you
she starts to rush out
calls out after her and if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at a leisure
we move through a vast wedding party following elizabeth and darcy
we meet all our characters
lydia and wickham are missing
let everyone have an end
darcy and elizabeth kiss then darcy pulls elizabeth off into the shadows
we see them disappear into the park
coming close we see them in the moonlight
its darcy and elizabeth
deer turn to gaze at them
the music fades as they walk further from the house up the hill past the outcrops of rocks
an owl hoots
darcy turns to elizabeth and smiles
allow me mrs darcy
he puts out his hand
she takes it
he helps her up the rocks
when they get to the top they sit there side by side and gaze at the distant lights of pemberley
how did it begin
i cannot fix the hour or the spot or the look
it was too long ago and i was in the middle before i knew it had begun
now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinenc
for the liveliness of your mind i did
you may as well call it impertinence though make a virtue of it by all means
my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible
and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as maybe
and i shall begin directly
we draw back their figures diminish smaller and smaller under the immense star spangled sky
fainter and fainter the sound of music and laughter
