quincy laughs derisively as monica walks to the top of the driveway
whispering what a dog
monica shoots him a glare

monica starts to dribble
jamal whistles as he walks backwards guarding her
she throws up a shot

quincy and jamal crack up
kelvin rolls his eyes
quincy grabs the rebound and shoots
quincy contd one zip
he rolls the ball to monica
she starts dribbling and again jamal just backs up with her
she passes to kelvin
jamal and quincy collapse on him leaving monica open under the basket
trapped kelvin has no choice but to pass it back
monica catches the ball and throws up a shot
it banks off the backboard
and drops through the net
the boys look at her in shock
monica tosses the ball back to quincy
quincy easily dribbles by kelvin and lays up the ball
he throws the ball back to monica
quincy contd two one
jamal plays her a little tighter
monica bounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball
quincy cant believe it
kelvin cracks up
aaah she dogged you
the game continues with quincy and monica trading baskets for their teams
quincy grows agitated with jamal who is unable to stop her
the score hits nine nine
quincy stands at the top of the driveway ball in hand
quincy dribbles through his legs then pops an outside shot
the ball bounces on the rim
and rolls off
quincy curses as monica grabs the rebound and clears the ball
jamal moves to guard her but quincy shoves him off
quincy contd i got her
monica smiles back at him

im going to be the first girl in the nba
ima be in the nba
youre gonna be my cheerleader
monica suddenly passes to kelvin sprints for the basket
quincy stumbles giving her a step
kelvin throws it back
quincy knows hes beat as monica goes for the winning lay up
in desperation he swings at her for the hard foul shoving her off balance
the boys stand frozen
quincy stares down at her his eyes wide with fear
monica leans over the sink as her mother camille wipes the blood from her face with a washcloth
her sister lena leans in the doorway making a face
she is a mirror of their mother with relaxed hair and painted nails
her father nathan moves behind lena holding a box
how are you feeling munchkin
nathan contd yeah youre through
she needs to stop running around like a little boy
how is she alright looking the way she does
camille shell be fine
he gives monica a wink crosses away
monica pulls the washcloth away from her mom and starts wiping the blood herself
ill get some ice
lena shakes her head follows
monica pulls the washcloth from her face and stares into the mirror
torn skin surrounds a small deep gash in her cheek
seeing her latest battle scar theres only one thing left for this little girl to do
quincy sits at the kitchen table writing i am sorry in block letters across a homemade card
his face is tight with concentration as he tries to write in a straight line
at the counter his mom nona moves a cake from its store box to a cake dish
she is beautiful with effort
she smooths the frosting with a spoon
zeke with the height and ego of an nba ballplayer enters
girl who you trying to fool
quincy looks up smiles
he quickly grabs a piece of crumpled paper and tosses it to zeke
alley oop dad
nona intercepts his pass
she points him back to his card
quincy scowls starts writing again
nona scoops some frosting on her finger holds it up
nona contd new neighbors
zeke wraps his lips around her finger sucks the frosting off
see quincy this is how your moms caught me with the old fake and bake

nona laughs pulls him down for a kiss
quincy suddenly throws down his pencil in frustration

zeke and nona pull away stare at quincy in shock

nona leans against the counter concerned
quincy contd mom

camille and nona stand among the piles of boxes
monica and quincy stand at their mothers sides stealing glances at each other
a large bandage covers monicas cheek
monica holds her card camille holds the cake
we moved back here when quincy was about five after zeke was traded
neighborhood was a little more mixed back then
until the black family down the street became the black family next door
camille tries to smooth down monicas unruly hair
monica moves her head
well thanks again

quincy looks up at his mom surprised
she quickly hugs his face into her stomach
camille lights up

well come on then
camille hands monica the cake
camille contd honey put this in the kitchen

quincy contd okay how bout this
quincy takes a couple steps back then does a cartwheel
it looks great until he crashes into the box with the cake
the cake falls onto his head and shoulder
monica doubles over laughing
quincy is embarrassed
camille and nona rush back into the living room
monica what did you do
to nona oh all that work

camille quickly crosses into the kitchen
quincy stares at the floor
nona bends down whispers in his ear
monica sits between lenas legs grimacing as lena works a comb through her freshly washed kinky hair
monicas head flops like a rag doll
her eyes are wet
lena keeps tugging
monica contd ow lena
monica punches her in the leg
lena yanks monicas head back as camille enters carrying a yellow dress on a hanger
monica sees it and her face falls

lena cackles in her ear
camille has to laugh
camille contd child pick up your lip

camille rubs her temples then hangs the dress on the door
to lena when youre done can you make sure she brushes her teeth

ive been running around all day
just then nathan enters
he holds up two dress shirts as if it were a matter of life and death
which one for tomorrow
nathan looks at both of them then nathan contd can you iron both tonight just in case
he kisses her on the cheek hands her the two shirts and crosses out
monica just watches

monica reacts surprised
lena puts the comb back to monicas hair

basketball posters clippers and usc memorabilia a basketball globe light
quincy lays tucked in bed eyes wide open listening to his parents making love
the sounds bring a smile to his face
quincy climbs out of bed wearing underwear
he moves to his window sees monica through her window directly across from his
her eyes are closed as lena braids her hair
quincy kneels down rests his arms on the window sill and watches
quincy sits atop his bmx bike in front of monicas house
a basketball is tucked under his arm
monica emerges walking her banana seater
she is looking cute in her yellow dress and braids tied with ribbons
a basketball sits in her back basket
quincy is taken aback stares at her

monica blinks in surprise
she thinks for a moment

i guess you know we play ball and we ride to school together
and if you get mad at me i gotta give you flowers
i dont like flowers
how bout twinkies
my mom wont ever buy them
an awkward beat between the new couple
finally i think we gotta kiss now
for how long
the two glance around then climb off their bikes and walk to the secluded area between their two houses
quincy contd ready
they lean in eyes wide open and touch lips
quincy counts to five with his fingers
they pull away embarrassed and walk back to the driveway
monica lifts her bike from the ground and climbs on
quincy contd wait

i want to ride my own bike
my dad always drives my mom
impatient so that means i have to ride with you
monica doesnt move
quincy contd come on

quincys face instantly clouds
laughs last time they won dr

he shoves her knocking her off her bike
quincy contd i dont wanna be your boyfriend you ugly dog
monica leaps up her dress now dirty
she shoves him back
i dont want to be your girlfriend big head
they grapple then fall to the ground swinging
mens ncaa finals
michigan state against indiana state
magic johnson against larry bird
magic drives on bird hits a beautiful scoop shot
he celebrates as he jogs back down court
title card second quarter then a snarling black cougar glares down from a large mural
on the court below a girls basketball play off game
the bleachers are almost half full with a hyped crowd
in the crowd are monicas parents
her father is excited and vocal
her mom reads a book
also in the stands the head a fine ass brother leans in the doorway sporting a letter jacket with an embroidered q on the chest
he gets as much attention as the game
a couple of junior varsity cheerleaders smile his way
u g l y you aint got no alibi you ugly yeah yeah you ugly
m a m a how you think you got that way your mama yeah yeah your mama
on the floor monica dribbles down court
just eighteen her athletic figure has a few curves but her loose jersey does little to show it off
her hair is a mess and her knees are dark with bruises
a small scar is visible on her cheek
she whips a no look around the back pass to a cutting teammate under the basket who scores
the crowd cheers
monica defends the opposing point guard like a gnat
she knocks the ball loose and grabs it up
she goes for a lay up and the opposing guard steps in front of her
monica crashes into her knocking both to the floor
offensive foul number thirty two
monica leaps up
she wasnt set
the referee ignores her
monica contd she was still moving
from the sideline coach hiserman waves frantically
let it go
monica stares down the ref as she jogs back on defense
the opposing guard drives the lane and puts up a shot
monica leaps and blocks it with a taunting scream
a technical foul
number thirty two
coach hiserman slams down his clipboard
monica charges the referee
a teammate grabs at her but she pushes her off
man you suck
the referee whips back around whistle in mouth
coach hiserman grabs her arm and pulls her off the court
sit down and shut up
monica slams down in a chair sweat pouring hands clenched
her mom watches from the stands completely embarrassed
the brother in the doorway turns leaves
monica looks up at the clock
six minutes left in the third monica still benched sits slumped in her chair her sweats on her face dry
she glances up at the clock
twenty seconds left in the fourth quarter
her teams up by six
her teammates dribble out the clock
the buzzer sounds and they dance across the floor
monica looks up in the stands
camille now forty three stands at the stove stirring a pot of gumbo
lena and pretty stands next to her holding a handful of plates and silverware
and if you want a thicker base you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour
but you use potato
camille nods as they cross into at the table monica is in mid conversation with her dad
camille and lena start setting the table
dad you have to talk to coach for me
and what am i supposed to say to the man
the coach from tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench
you lost your head
i was just showing emotion
so that means its alright for you to act like that
to monica whatd you do
i dont know why i keep hoping youll grow out of this tomboy thing
im a lesbian
lena chokes on her drink cracks up
thats not funny well thats what you think isnt it
cause id rather wear a jersey than an apron
watch your mouth
nathan quickly jumps in tries to clean things up
monica i think her point is
maybe its time to start thinking about other things besides basketball
taken aback what
you only have one game left and you havent been recruited
munchkin i wanted it as bad as you did but we have to face reality
the coach from usc is going to be at the championship
but chances are
chances are theres still a chance
she can always soften her dad but not her mom
if youd just listen for once youd realize you have a lot more going for yourself
youre smart youd be pretty if you put a comb to your head
i mean why walk around with your hair looking like whodunit
as her mom nags on monica looks out the window
outside quincy and a girl lean against a car parked at the curb slobbing each other down
just shy of with a magnetic face and muscular body he is a brother who drank his chocolate milk
he is also the monica watches and her moms droning voice disappears
felicia cant get enough of quincys lips
yo felicia i gotta get to my game
she keeps kissing him
quincy contd and my moms about to be home
so im not good enough to meet your mom
girl she knew i had a hottie like you up inhere shed beat the black off me
kissing him again thats a lot of beating
she finally lets go and slides into her car
quincy watches her go with a cocky ass smile
a frenzied crowd from floor to ceiling watches quincy explode across the court
he is the complete point guard hitting from the outside driving to the hoop no look passes playing tight d
his father zeke now stands on the sideline
his muscle has softened a little over the last five years of retirement
monica sits alone in the bottom row holding a basketball
she wears jeans and a t shirt and her hair is pulled back in a simple pony tail
quincy does a killer cross over move and his defender falls down
he lays up the ball then taunts the player he just poster ized
behind monica two girls smack each other excitedly
one of them shawnee pretty big chest slides down into the empty seat next to her
your hair looks so cute like that
monica knows shes full of shit doesnt respond
shawnee contd so

shawnee holds out a folded note
monica doesnt take it

i dont wanna look fast
drops it in monicas lap thanks girl
she slides back to her seat
monica shakes her head turns back to the game
quincy dives for a loose ball
shawnee clutches her friend
shawnee contd good lord look at that ass
i just want to lick the sweat off it
monica takes in his tight body
he does look good
quincy jogs back down court and flashbulbs go off
quincy stands with his dad his sweat still fresh talking to a reporter named jim
quincy word has it you might make the jump the nba

my sons college bound with or without basketball
you could make a career by telling me where
gotta wait til the press conference
but youd love for him to play at usc like you did
id love for him to get a good education
then thats it
jim crosses away
zeke puts an affectionate arm around his son as they walk toward the locker room
zeke contd we should have another talk with coach carril at princeton
pop theres no way an ivy league team is going all the way
i dont care about the team
i care about the school

zeke sighs then you played good

quincy smiles wide
then so you up for a game later
i dont wanna hurt your feelings
you dont wanna hurt your back

quincy watches his dad move toward the doors stopping once to give an autograph
zeke passes monica entering
hey miss baller
monica approaches quincy
way to hoop
i know this
what do you want
a ride home
your legs dont look broke
look big head ill be at your car

silence as quincy wheels his jeep wrangler toward home
monica sits in the passenger seat basketball in lap
she pulls shawnees note from her pocket
quincy glances it over
some note shawnee easton told me to give to you
thinks big ass titties
monica shoots him a disgusted look
quincy reaches out
quincy contd give it here
monica leans away reads aloud
i think you are so fine and ive been wanting to get with you

monica laughs in disbelief
monica contd what a ho

quincy looks down at the spalding basketball in her lap and cracks up
monica contd fuck you quincy

monica points to the scar on her cheek
im not the one who put this scar here

quincy turns faces her
thats it give it your best shot

quincy pulls his jeep into his driveway
please you jump in some guys face talk smack and you get a pat on your ass
but because im a female i get told to calm down and act like a lady
im a ballplayer okay
a ball player
with a jacked up attitude
didnt know you cared so much
monica slams out of the jeep and walks across the lawn to her house
quincy exits his ride
quincy steps inside drops his bag on the floor
his mom nona approaches from the dining room
whats up moms
nona holds up a large hoop earring
what is this

quincy crosses into nona follows
quincy pulls open the fridge grabs a couple of slices of cold pizza

nona smiles starts back the kitchen

quincy exits to his room
nona angrily rolls her hair as zeke undresses
i had some players to see and hands to shake
at one in the morning

i came second to the nba

zeke looks at her offended

livid nona pulls off her gold bracelet throws it at him
fine then how many nights home is that

she grabs a pair of gold earrings from her jewelry box nails him
how about now
i got a week yet
quincy lies in bed staring at the ceiling as his parents continue to have it out
he rolls out of bed pulls on a pair of shorts and a t shirt
he moves to his window pulls it open and climbs out
quincy crosses the grass to monicas window knocks quietly
long beat then monica sleepily stumbles to her window wearing boxers and a tank top
she pushes it open and quincy pulls himself through
now a routine monica tosses quincy one of her pillows and blankets then crawls back into bed
he lays out on the floor and closes his eyes
monica casts a long sleepy glance at him then drifts back to sleep
posters of magic line three walls
a hand made collage of female college and olympic ball players fills the fourth
the only real soft touch is the teddy bear laying on the pillow
monica sits on the floor between lenas legs as lena puts monicas hair in cornrows
that too tight
moms going to hate it
always on my ass anyway
like you dont give her a hard time
just cause i dont kiss her booty like you
lena yanks monicas head back
monica contd ow

lena yanks her head back again

monica is not convinced
lena contd well do something cute with your hair get you a dress get you some heels

lena starts to braid monicas hair again
you ever been in love
too many times
they ever love you back
yeah once i cut them off
monica just shrugs
lena continues braiding
quincy and zeke sweat through a playfully intense game of one on one
quincy almost breaks zekes ankles with a cross over dribble and leaves him in the dust
he stops under the basket waves for his dad to come on before laying it up
zeke smiles tells quincy to bring that shit on again
quincy tries his cross over again and this time zeke picks him clean
zeke taunts him as he easily backs in on him to the basket
camille stands at the stove cooking up some yams
monica enters with a gym bag over her shoulder dribbling her ball
then im leaving
camille fills a spoon from the pot holds it out
i cant eat before a game
child take a bite
monica sighs takes a bite
camille contd i found some apricot chutney and mixed it with the yams
you really should be a caterer or something like you used to say
in between all the other things i have to do
she pulls off monicas hood then stops when she sees her braids
monica looks back defiantly
so good luck
she forces a smile turns back to her cooking
monica just nods and crosses out
the championship game
the bleachers are almost filled
nathan and lena sit dead center
also in attendance coach quincy sits in the back row with a couple of teammates
as always hes the focus of much attention
monica and her teammates are crouched in a tight huddle surrounding coach hiserman
i dont have to tell you girls how big this game is
we worked too damn hard all season to leave without this championship
so lets play smart
looks at monica lets play in control and lets kick some butt
cougars on three
as monica moves to center court she glances up at the usc coach then at quincy
monica takes a deep breath as she lines up for the opening tip
an opposing player suddenly bumps her out of position
monica glares at her but just moves over
the ball is tossed up
one minute left
cougars down three
monica dribbles down court bouncing with confidence as her opponent plays her tight
monica zips a no look pass to a teammate who lays it up
quincy punches one of his friends oh shit
she is having the game of her life
on the defensive end monica steals the ball
she drives the length of the court lays it up between two defenders
the crowd is hyped
twenty seconds left up by one
monica hounds the opposing guard as she brings up the ball
monica suddenly reaches in and knocks the ball loose
as she goes for the ball a whistle
reaching in number thirty two
one and one
boos fill the gym
monicas eyes widen
anger rushes through her as she starts for the ref
monica contd thats bullsh
monica catches herself turns the word shit into a frustrated yell as she quickly moves away from the ref
monica lines up for the free throw clenching her fists
the girl hits the first one
then she hits the second
with ten seconds left down by one monica drives down court and throws up a prayer
everyone is on their feet as the ball spins around the rim
it pops out
an opposing player grabs the rebound and monica has no choice but to foul her
monica has just fouled out
she walks to her bench and drops down
she buries her face in a towel and sobs
the buzzer goes off
quincy stares at monica feeling almost as bad as she does
monica sits slumped on her bed in a bathrobe as lena stands in front of her putting the finishing touches on monicas make up
might help if you didnt look so evil
i dont even want to go
she steps back looks at her work
beat then camille enters
lena contd talk to me
camille stares at her daughter taken aback by how great she looks

monica still looks miserable
camille contd you okay
camille contd well can you promise me one thing

monica takes this in as lena returns with camilles pearls
camille puts them around monicas neck
monica looks back at her

camille smiles at her daughter nods
monica touches the pearls
an r b song jams through the speakers filling the dance floor with high school kids in suits and dresses
in the middle of the floor quincy gets his groove on with his date shawnee
she dances so provocatively there is no mistaking what she has in mind for later
over at the doors monica enters with her college date jason and fine

he pulls shawnee to the middle of the floor
monica nervous at first a little awkward but jason gently guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax
jason moves his hands down monicas back pulling her in closer
shawnee snuggles into quincys chest runs her hands down his neck
the heat from bodies grows
monica and quincy glance up at the same time and catch each others eyes
they start to look away but find they cant
eyes locked as they dance they move together almost feel each other
finally as their bodies turn they lose sight
monica puts her head to jasons chest quincy slides his hands lower down shawnees back
the music continues
jason and monica are parked up on mulholland drive
ll cool js i need love plays on the tape deck
jason has his arm around monica ready to make his move
rattling freshman year my free throw percentage was fifty one percent cause i was shooting it like a jump shot
jason leans in kisses her bare shoulder
monica contd um

jason kisses her neck
monica contd uh by keeping my feet set and really following through
jason goes in for the slam dunk
kisses monica on the lips
its the first time shes really been kissed
jason pulls away smiles

your sister told me hands off but i cant help myself
jason leans in
monica closes her eyes and they kiss some more
monica tries to follow his practiced lips
jasons tongue slides in and their bodies slide down
his hand moves across her breast
monicas eyes pop open
naive and inexperienced monica shuts her eyes tight
jasons car pulls off monica slowly moves to her front door
she looks in the living room window
her mom is asleep in a chair trying to wait up
monica catches her reflection in the window
she glares at her made up face then wipes at her mouth with her hand
she steps back walks to her bedroom window
she pulls it open kicks off her heels and climbs through
monica moves to her bed and drops down
she sits motionless for a beat then suddenly feels something beneath her
she reaches for it
its a letter from the usc athletic department
monica stares at it in her hands
light suddenly cuts through the darkness
monica turns and is surprised to see quincy standing in the middle of his room pulling off his jacket
monica moves to her window pulls it open
quincy looks over
then he climbs out of his window drops down
early night for you isnt it
i was about to ask you the same thing going out with a college boy and all
monica doesnt respond
quincy contd so whered you go after

well im sure she kept her word and left you satisfied
that what you think
quincy contd little after you left i told shawnee it was time to go and i drove her ass straight home
and after she told me i was the dumbest brother in the world i took off
cause i dont just stick my dick in anything
monica takes this in
i was sitting in jasons ride with him kissing on me and feeling on me and it was really bugging me cause i couldnt remember how many offensive boards i
had in the championship
and then i guess she got tired of me sort of accidentally kneeing him in the balls
beat then quincy cracks up
monica laughs with him
you had four offensive rebounds
monica stares at him surprised
hold up for a second
monica disappears back inside
beat then she re appears
she climbs out her window drops down
quincy looks at her
she holds out the envelope from usc
whend you get this
it was on my bed when i came in
then can you just

quincy takes the envelope sits down on the grass
monica sits down beside him
he tears open the envelope and pulls out the letter
monica stares at him as he reads trying to see an answer in his face
quincy finally looks up
quincy contd damn girl
monicas face falls
and then a slow smile spreads across quincys face
quincy contd they want you
monica grabs the letter reads
her head just drops as a tidal wave of relief washes over her
quincy contd congratulations
monica looks up cheesing
quincy contd im gonna be there too

i knew it
monica cant contain her excitement
without thinking she gives quincy a kiss
they pull away then break into nervous laughter
what was that about
i know right
but they both want more
they lean in kiss deeply
they fall back on the grass
suddenly monica pulls away sits up
quincy follows instantly apologetic
monica stares at him then to his surprise she reaches over gives his shirt a small tug with her finger
quincy stares at her then slowly pulls off his tie
he nervously unbuttons his shirt
he fumbles with the last two buttons
monica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress self conscious
quincy cant keep his eyes off her
he pulls off his pants
monica glances down and her eyes widen
she looks scared to death
quincy smiles softly leans in and gently kisses her
they lay down
quincy reaches into his pants for a condom
his hands shake as he puts it on
they stare at each other as he moves on top of her
quincy pushes inside her
she flinches back in pain
quincy immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes
softly you want to stop
monica shakes her head
quincy pushes inside again
he looks down at her with tenderness moves gently kisses her tears

monica and the three other freshmen sit in front of them jiggling nervously
coach miller stands in front of the team
i dont know some of you very well yet and you dont know me because im still being nice to you
laughter from the upperclassmen
coach miller contd but my philosophy is simple
hard work and sacrifice
theres a lot of basketball history and pride here at usc but just putting on the cardinal and gold doesnt make you a great player
hard work and sacrifice makes you a great player
what you were doesnt matter anymore
for the first time in your life you wont be the best
youll be going up against women that are bigger and stronger and better than you ever imagined
so the question is how will you respond
well your answer better be hard work and sacrifice because thats the only way youre gonna make it through
vince lombardi preached it and i teach it there is only one way to succeed at anything and that is to give everything
coach miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in
monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions
like her a lot of cockiness a lot of fear
coach miller contd a few simple rules
eleven oclock curfew no exceptions
always be on time no exceptions
attend every class no exceptions
no drugs no alcohol no getting pregnant
and finally respect yourselves respect your coaches and respect your teammates right sidra
sidra senior point guard nods from the second row
thats right coach
by the end of this year some of you will hate me
the upperclassmen crack up
coach miller contd some of you will want to go home

hes a real p
a prime time player
every college in the country wanted him but he chose to follow in his fathers footsteps and become a trojan
hes gonna have a lot on his shoulders this season
but coach cheryl miller feels that if just one of her freshmen has a breakout year they can go all the way
its a long season anything can happen but one thing is for sure
its gonna be awesome baby
a hundred flashbulbs pop as quincy jogs out to center court
the crowd goes crazy as
monica sits on the bench watching sidra run the floor against unlv as
quincy drives to the three point line against cal and puts it up
it drops through the net
he pounds his fist against the number twenty two on his chest nods to zeke standing behind the bench as
coach miller motions to monica
she jumps up pulls off her sweats
she jogs past arizona bench and onto the floor as
quincy goes up for a dunk against north carolina
he jams it down grips the rim and pulls his legs up high as
monica catches a long outlet pass
she drops a no look bounce pass between two berkeley defenders to a teammate who scores
she jogs back as
zeke grips quincys head proudly affectionately as they walk off the floor after a game against washington as
sidra crashes to the floor immediately grabs at her ankle
monica rises off the bench
televisions hang from every corner broadcasting various games
zeke and quincy sit at a bar
quincy is still hyped from his game
up and under between two defenders with the left hand
thats gotta make sportscenter
zeke just nods as the bartender owner crosses over
he is an ex ballplayer named terry
quincy contd they cant stop me pop
what are you having zeke
and an orange juice for my kid
cross overs looking good quincy
i know your old man didnt teach you that
didnt need a cross over to post you up
terry laughs as he moves off to fix the drinks
something is on zekes mind but before he can speak on it
you know the numbers im putting up are better than any freshman
some people are saying im a definite lottery pick
zeke suddenly focuses
you know people
well tell them to mind their damn business
youre smart enough to get a degree
im also good enough to go pro
you know how much higher the play level is in the nba
give yourself time to develop quincy
get an education
the nba aint going nowhere
you came out early
your mom got pregnant and i had to make choices

some girl thats been hanging on at every party

zeke stares at his son
you got the balls to ask me that
quincy cant hold his fathers look
zeke shakes his head hurt
no you need to hear me say it ill say it
its not true
quincy looks in his fathers eyes knows hes telling the truth
so what are you gonna do
i want this thing to go to court but my lawyers telling me to settle
a case like this could hang around for months and im up for this player relations job with the clips
this gets out false or not no onell touch me
whats mom think
we havent exactly been living the fairy tale life the past few years
something like this happens it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart
well just have to see how it plays out
then im giving her some space couple days
just then a college student approaches
yo q man great game
the student holds out a piece of paper without even a glance to zeke
can i get an autograph
quincy nods signs the guys paper
zeke watches his son the rising star
through the windows we see quincy enter the house
he glances around then walks to the living room
he sees his mom sitting outside by the pool drink in hand looking torn up
he pulls open the sliding glass door
nona jumps then sees quincy
she quickly puts her drink down
you scared me
quincy glances at her half hidden glass
last time i remember you drinking was when marvin gaye died
no response from nona
quincy contd this about dad

dont sweat it okay
sooner or later the truthll come out
beat whose truth are you talking about
mom we cant let something like this mess up the family
she doesnt respond
quincy studies her
quincy contd i mean you believe him right
nona sits silent humiliated
quincy contd mom

this is just about money you know that
i mean how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these hos

he wouldnt lie
nona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him
confused quincy opens it
he pulls out a couple of photos zeke outside a party
in one photo his arm is around a young woman
in another photo they kiss
and yet another they climb into his car
quincy contd what
i hired somebody
how pathetic is that
after all his late nights and meetings and i still needed proof
quincy just stares at the photos
nona contd i used to think i was lucky just to be married to zeke mccall but im too tired
quincy looks stricken but he moves to nona comforts her as she cries
monica sits with a devastated quincy high up in the bleachers
in the distance the clock tower glows
dont put your hands in your pockets hold your head up always look a man in the eye and all the time im hanging on his every word like hes
god or something
i know he messed up but that doesnt change what hes been to you
what has he been to me
i mean he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing
like it was easy
then and im standing there getting loud on my mom like shes the one with no sense
he even had me wanting to play for the clippers
man how stupid am i
youre not stupid
i know a lot of brothers dog their wives i just never thought my pops would do some shit like this
monica puts her arms around him
they sit there quiet
monica glances up at the clock tower
quincy contd what
beat why dont we walk to my dorm
im not up for running into anybody
lets just kick it here alright
coach has us on eleven oclock curfew

quincy looks at her almost in shock
didnt realize you were watching the clock
i mean i can stay a few more minutes
dont sweat it
i should be alone anyway
monica reluctantly stands
will you call me when you get in
monica gives him a kiss
then she turns and crosses away
the lights are off but monica sits up in bed
she wears shayla lies under her covers across the room
i shouldnt have left
go to sleep
you should have seen him shay
mon sidras out for one game and you got the start
but you get caught breaking curfew and coach is gonna send your ass back to the bench

shaylas warning slowly sinks in
finally monica lays down
the clock tower glows
quincy still sits in the bleachers
tears fill his eyes as his world comes crashing down
the packed crowd is hyped
nathan sits by himself in the stands excited
monica sits on the bench with four of her teammates
the rest of the team is lined up in front of them including sidra in street clothes
and now the starting line up for your women of troy
at center a senior toni noise
toni rises jogs through the line of teammates to the court
announcer contd at forward a senior lisa mason
lisa stands skips through the line
announcer contd at forward a junior zvette mitchell
zvette jumps up bumps into each teammate as she moves down the line
announcer contd at guard a freshman monica wright
monica takes a deep breath then jogs through the line
she gets to the middle of the floor and looks around with her game face on
announcer contd and at guard a sophomore sandra perez
sandra jogs out and the rest of the team follows
everyone gathers in a tight circle with their arms around each other
look yall we got all these people here to see big bad la tech

so everybody better leave everything out on that floor you got that
one two three
a sellout crowd for the mens sc temple game
and quincy is having the worst game of his life
he drives down court on a fast break
he ignores his two open teammates and puts up a three pointer
it hits nothing but air
the crowd boos
humiliated quincy tries to steal the ball back and commits a stupid foul
his teammates glare at him as they line up for free throws
late second half

monica drives the lane drawing two defenders
she looks like shes about to force up a shot then suddenly whips up a pass to a wide open sandra at the three point line
nothing but net
sc up one
coach miller claps intensely on the sideline
thats it thats it
ten seconds left
game on the line
monica tries to lob a pass inside to toni
the pass is knocked away and grabbed up by the opposing point guard
it is a one on one between monica and the guard
the girl drives hard for the winning hoop
monica races to the key and slides in front of her
the guard goes up and slams into monica
both crash to the floor as the ball drops through the net and the buzzer goes off
the two women stare up at the referee from the floor
and then offensive foul
monica leaps up as the crowd goes crazy
toni grabs up monica in a hug as their teammates celebrate around them
quincy drags himself to his bench slumps down dejectedly as the temple owls celebrate their win around him
the female players continue to celebrate as they undress

they give each other a pound
lisa looks at monica standing in her shorts and sports bra
oh damn mon

the women break into laughter

monica turns sees coach miller standing in her office doorway
she motions for her
monica heads over
trophies plaques and photos fill every empty space
coach miller sits behind her desk
monica stands before her
you couldve given up after you threw that ball away
but you kept your head and you showed real heart

realization finally hits
monica looks at coach miller completely thrown
it seems like youre always yelling at me
you think id go hoarse for a player with no potential
when i ignore you thats when you worry
then go get dressed
monica nods crosses out
as monica walks back to her teammates coach miller steps into the doorway
sidra looks at monica as she rises crosses over
monica avoids her eyes as they pass
sidra enters the office and the door closes
yo sis whats going on

black folks pack the cramped houseparty bumping to a phat hip hop joint
monica bounces through the throng
a girl grabs her arm

monica smiles wider
she spots reggie dancing in the crowd moves to him

monica is suddenly pulled into a dance routine by sandra and lisa
she laughs tires to move away but they wont let her go
monica gives in grooves with them
quincy walks through the door with a half empty forty in his hand
girls immediately try to grab his attention from the dance floor or stare him down from the sidelines
quincy sees monica on the dance floor
he stands watching her
takes a drink
monica finally looks over sees him
she smiles crosses to him

monica looks over sees sidra standing in the doorway
there is no escaping this confrontation
she glances at quincy then crosses over
quincy turns sees her disappear back inside

but that was a dumb ass pass to toni
ten seconds left you run out the clock
monica shakes her head
an awkward silence
sidra contd id be lying if i said i wasnt pissed
just one word of advice for next season

sidra turns and walks away
quincy takes one long drink from his cup
kerry and spandexed stands directly in front of him flirtatiously
he steps aside as she tries to work the keg
nothing comes out
she nods at his cup smiles
if thats the last beer you and i are sharing
shayla glances over as quincy pumps the keg a couple of times
kerry hands him her cup and he starts filling it up
kerry contd i like watching you play

quincy knows he should blow her off but hes digging the attention
he hands her back her cup
quincy contd whats your name
monica looks over at quincy and sees him talking to the hoochie
the girl looks too damn comfortable
monica moves back outside
kerry contd ill see you
she swishes past monica
shayla accidentally bumps her

monica stares after him
quincy pushes through his front door then stops short in his doorway
zeke sits on the couch

we need to talk
we aint got nothing to talk about
i messed up okay i know that

and some things should never fucking happen
boy youre so perfect you can look down on me
i aint a damn liar
your mom was real quick to show you those pictures wasnt she
well she was nineteen when she got pregnant and dont get me wrong youre the best thing in my life but she knew i wasnt ready for no marriage
so now youre saying my mother trapped you
im saying i handled my responsibilities like a man
but when youre in the nba you pull into a city and theres a hundred women waiting at the hotel
and another twenty that made it past security on your floor
and the boldest one is standing right at your door
and after awhile it just becomes part of the game
then im sorry i lied to you i shouldnt have
but i did it cause i love you
zeke looks at his son meaning every word
quincy stares back long and hard
since were being honest guess i should tell you
im dropping out of school and going pro
quincy just stares back
zeke contd quincy youd be making the biggest mistake of your life
sarcastic from your mouth
desperate i know your mad at me okay but i cant let you do this
always thought cant wasnt in a mans vocabulary
zeke is taken aback by the hatred in his sons eyes
he turns and without another word exits
quincy stands across the street from the houseparty staring up at the balcony
monica leans against the railing laughing with a couple of teammates
quincy watches her then turns and walks away
monicas eyes are on fire as she races an oregon player for a loose ball
both dive for it slide across the floor
monica grabs it up screams for a time out as her opponent tries to wrestle away the ball
monica walks down the hall to quincys suite
the window is open
the sounds of nintendo are heard
she walks in without knocking
reggie sits on the couch with a teammate playing nintendos duck hunt
they barely give her a nod
monica crosses into quincy stands at an ironing board ironing a t shirt
hey whats up
you werent at my game
yeah sorry about that
i had this meeting with this guy
quincy pulls on the t shirt
quincy contd you win
yeah i hit a three at the buzzer
the man again
a knock at the front door
monica follows then stops short
kerry the spandexed girl from the party stands in the doorway
quincy gives her a hug
monica stares at him in disbelief
reggie and his teammate smack each other oh shit
oh kerry this is monica
what the hells going on
were going to get some food
are you out of your mind
maybe i should come back
you stay ill leave
she storms out
monica slams her car door
her face is a mask of anger and confusion
camille exits the house car keys in hand
she sees her
what are you doing here
didnt know i needed a reason to come home
dont be defensive
im just surprised to see you
hes still at the bank
camille looks at her
camille contd everything okay

camille just nods doesnt bother asking again
well im going to get dinner
she pulls open her car door
camille contd its just a game
whenever you lose you get this attitude
but its just a game
monica rolls her eyes as her mom leaves
quincy sits on the wall outside of monicas dorm as monica slowly makes her way up the walk
she sees him stops
can we talk
talk to your new girlfriend
i just took the ho to burger king alright
least she had time for me
so you fucked around to prove a point
i just said i didnt fuck around
but you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me
what q man did i forget to kiss your ass like everybody else
you forgot to be there
that night you wanted to talk about your dad i had a curfew
what was i supposed to do
if i stayed i wouldnt be starting
least you got your priorities straight
i never asked you to choose
never had to
im a ballplayer
if anyone knows what that means it should be you
well if all you care about is basketball why you fucking me
go fuck dick vitale
monica punches the shit out of quincy then pushes past him
quincy grabs her arm stopping her
quincy contd hold up
im sorry alright
they stand silent
trying to come down from their anger
how do i know next time youre feeling neglected or whatever youre not going to run around on me
if were going to be together i have to be able to trust you
im not asking for us to be together
monica flinches in shock
im going through a lot of shit right now more than you have time for
how are you going to tell me what i have time for
i mean whatever i did
we can fix this
i dont think so
you dont think so
look im entering the draft
i decided to go pro
and who knows where ill end up you know
monicas heart is sinking fast
when did you decide all this
few days ago
so thats it just forget about us
this aint about us anymore its about me
monica is crushed
beat as quincy struggles to stay cold
quincy contd but you know id still like us to be friends
she fights back tears
quincy has to look away
monica cant respond
i guess ill see you around
beat then quincy turns and walks away
monica tries to fight her tears but her pain hurt and confusion are too much
finally she gives in and the tears fall
magic sits beside his wife cookie
he shocks the world as he announces his retirement from basketball
title card fourth quarter then madrid pampolona the running of the bulls old world architecture
finally we rest on a large billboard a photo of monica in a basketball uniform drinking a spanish soft drink
monica jogs down the congested cobble stone street a sports bag over her shoulder
she is twenty three
half assed braids frame her matured features
she passes store fronts street vendors and dodges pedestrians as she makes her way toward a large older arena
an excited crowd jockeys for position at the front doors
above them a huge banner reads campeonato de europeo
as monica heads for the back entrance a cheer goes up from a large contingent in the crowd
monica smiles waves back
two little girls break from line run to her
they giggle hold out a piece of paper and a pencil
as monica signs her autograph a tall woman carrying a matching sports bag approaches
she is luisa spanish
thick spanish accent monica
what is up
monica hands the girls her autograph and they run off
large game no
they duck into the arena
paint peels off the walls
windows are broken overhead
monica sits alone at her locker taping her own ankles
her ten teammates all from spain sit on the surrounding benches talking and joking among themselves in spanish
monica is clearly an outsider
coach parra spanish late s enters
the women immediately stop talking
coach parra gives an animated impassioned speech in spanish
monica doesnt understand a word just continues taping her ankles
coach parra finishes and the women clap pumped up
monica turns to luisa seated next to her on the bench
what did he say
he say to give the ball to you
the arena is packed with a raucous european crowd chanting and waving signs the love their womens basketball
monica walks onto the floor tucking her jersey into her shorts
the uniforms are old style polyester and tight
her clubs name is stitched on the front godella
as she hits center court a smile suddenly breaks through her game face
standing opposite her playing for the opposing italian club is sidra her rival from usc
well what do you know
whats up sidra
im gonna love winning this championship in your house
how do you say youre dreaming in italian
they move into position
the ball is tossed up
italy winds the tip and the ball is passed to sidra
monica hounds her as she brings up the ball
sidra shoves her off and to the floor and scores
womens pro ball is at a whole other level
bigger better tougher
the ball is passed in to monica
she drives down court goes up for a lay up
an italian player shoves monica in mid air taking out her legs
monica crashes on the hardwood
monica lays still for a moment then pushes herself up and walks to the free throw line without a word
a huge crowd dances fervently to the live spanish music
in the middle of the floor the spanish players are the life of the party
in a corner monica sits with sidra drinking and watching the festivities
a large trophy sits on the table
can you take that damn thing off the table
you mean my championship trophy
monica sets it down in the seat next to her puts an arm around it
sidra shakes her head
still a cocky bitch
she downs her drink motions to the waiter
uno mas por favor
the waiter nods
monica contd last i heard you were playing in sweden
yeah four years ago
they had me staying in this tiny ass town with like fifty people
im not playing there was about a thousand goats running around and it gets dark at four oclock
then the whack club im on loses three games in a row and i get blamed
so they fire me
just like that
so ive been playing with this italian club the last three years
hows that been
even though the whole first season my teammates didnt pass to me cause they were mad the american was making more money
smiles i led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way i could touch the damn ball
monica laughs as the waiter brings her drink
she tries to pay but he just shakes his head crosses away
sidra contd most of us dont win championships our first year overseas
please i went through the same drama as everybody else
i mean the first four months only person i could talk to was this chick luisa who knew like ten words of english from watching old difrent strokes reruns
swear to god i had to tell her if she said what you talking bout willis
one more time i was gonna kick her ass
they watch the madness out on the dance floor
so what are these spanish guys like
i wouldnt know
youve been over here seven months and you aint tapped anything
just not my type i guess
shoot italian boys love them some black women
they cant get enough of me
you ever think about going back
but whats the alternative not playing
you remember big toni
off monicas nod she quit last year now shes working at some bookstore
i mean look at us
they treat us like were hollywood stars over here
we just played in the championship game
it doesnt get much sweeter than this
monica takes this in
her eyes do not reflect someone on top of the world
she takes a long drink
a small sparse one bedroom
sam diane and the rest of the gang from cheers fill the small tv screen that flickers in the darkness
their dialogue is dubbed in spanish
monica sits on the floor braiding her hair
feelings of loneliness threaten to swallow her whole
she looks out her window and sees her billboard looming in the distance
she just stares
the crowd erupts as a laker player dunks the ball on a fast break
laker announcers chick hearn and stu lantz
stu this game is in the refrigerator
the door is closed the lights are out the butters hard and the jell oooooos jigglin
and here come the subs
quincy pulls off his sweats and jogs onto the court with the rest of the subs
he is twenty three a man
his goatee and tired eyes make him look older
he now wears number twenty stu lantz contd v
its good to see these guys get a little playing time
and the fans love it
quincy immediately gets a pass in the corner
he puts up a quick three and it banks hard off the rim
chick and stu
three pointer is off for the kid from sc
came out after his freshman year now in his fifth year with the league
the son of zeke mccall played twelve years with the clippers
nods pretty good player
the kids moved around quite a bit but hes hoping to finally have a home with the lakers
quincy steals the ball has nothing but open court ahead of him
chick hearn contd v
watch out folks its showtime
quincy takes off from the hash mark and throws down a monster jam
he swings high off the rim
his hand slips and he crashes to the floor
his knee twists at a sickening angle
the dwindling crowd gasps as quincy clutches his left knee writhing in pain
zeke walks down the corridor checking room numbers
he is forty five now
his slight paunch as become a roll
he sees nona exiting a room with an empty water pitcher in hand
her hair is in locks
nona looks over
her eyes narrow
zeke contd hows he doing
whats that not great
the doctorll be back in a minute
he tore his acl
zekes shoulders slump
then he looks back at her
almost didnt recognize you with your hair like that
how you been
and he wont want to see you
nona walks over to a man standing nearby
he puts an arm around her and they move down the hall
zeke watches for a beat then pulls open quincys door steps inside
quincy lays in the bed
his knee is bandaged and propped up by pillows
he stares out the window
quincy turns sees his father
he turns back to the window
zeke contd well you made sportscenter
what do you want
came by to check on you
after five years
dont remember that being my fault
seems like you divorced me same time as your mom
look im busy
i can see that
i know things look pretty bleak right now but you cant get down on yourself
i stopped taking your advice a long time ago or did you forget
i know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me
and now im paying for it right
that what this is about
i told you so
you want me to fuck off
fine ill fuck off but not til i say something
zeke contd youre a better ballplayer than i ever was
but you got a lot of other things going for you
i always felt
i always knew that you could do anything you wanted
you want to be a ballplayer be a ballplayer
just know you aint like everybody else on that court
you aint like i was
you got options
thats all i ever tried to show you
youre still trying to tell me what i should and shouldnt do
how come you couldnt be the man you kept trying to make me
zeke stares at his son wishing he could satisfy him with an answer
i just couldnt with nothing left to say zeke pulls open the door and leaves
quincy stares at the door long after it closes
a nurse enters carrying a bouquet of flowers
she moves past the empty bed puts them on a table already overflowing with flowers
she pulls open the blinds and light floods the room
she crosses back out
a toilet flush
beat then quincy slowly hops out of the bathroom scratching his bare ass through the opening of his gown
and i thought this was gonna be awkward
quincy whips around and is shocked to see monica standing there laughing
she has clearly made an effort with her appearance
monica quickly goes to him catches his arm before he falls
quincy stares at her completely thrown
its been five years
an awkward beat
monica contd so how you doing
i heard you were in spain
smiling i see your peach fuzz finally grew in
quincy rubs his goatee self consciously
just something im trying
no it looks good
i mean its cool
quincy tries to adjust his footing and flinches in pain
shouldnt you be lying down or
but you can sit
my dad said you tore your acl
what are the doctors saying
shrugs a lot of things
all i know is ill be back in six months
i thought a torn acl was ten to twelve
not for quincy mccall
i forgot q man
an awkward beat
so hows pro ball europe
we won the championship
still working on being the first girl in the nba
well i tried sneaking in after college but they found breasts during my physical
i never did
kiss my ass
monica cracks up
quincy laughs with her
monica contd i cant believe its been five years
tried calling you a couple times
wanted to give you props on making first team all american
and then when magic retired i tried calling you again
lying must have been my cheap ass answering machine
it was always messing up
figured it was something like that
they look at each other
the moment is building
quincy contd so when do you go back
actually i dont
what do you mean
im tired of playing overseas
thinking about giving it a rest for awhile
completely thrown a rest
basketball just isnt fun anymore
he stares at her
quincy and monica turn as kyra kessler black and beautiful rushes into the room
she wears a flight attendants uniform
she goes to quincy gives him a kiss
im so sorry
no one would switch flights with me
why are you up
get in bed
she takes quincys arm moves him to the bed
kyra contd tell me youre going to be okay
im gonna be okay
then she glances over at monica
kyra this is monica
you grew up together right
quincys told me about you
monica smiles awkwardly
this is kyra
the shock hits too quick to cover
but monica tries
i didnt know
i should go
it means a lot that you came by
yes we appreciate that
yeah and quincy good luck with your knee and everything
monica forces one last smile pulls open the door and leaves
monica walks down the hall shell shocked
camille moves between the counter and the stove whipping up a couple pecan pies
need any help
i can manage
monica nods and moves to the barstool
camille contd your sisters bringing the baby over
you should try to be here
cant wait to see him she falls silent then i just saw quincy
how is he
to that stewardess
yeah you met her
his mother had a cookout a few weeks ago
he could do a lot better if you ask me
maybe she is
camille looks up studies monica for a moment
i thought you were over him
so what do i do
find out where theyre registered and send them a gift
you didnt want my opinion in the first place so why even ask
i asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy
there you go
what do you want me to tell you monica to go beat that girl up
to go have sex with him
im not going to do that
yes i believe thinking of other people is important and yes id rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot
if that makes me too prissy for you too bad
monica stares at her mother
theres no going back
so thats why we cant get along
because id rather shoot a dumb jump shot
youre the one always turning your nose up at me
no i dont
ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything i had to say
i wasnt lena
i didnt care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume
what was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things i knew could help you
because youre pushing me to be something im not
so youre angry with me because youre standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume
monica is busted
it takes her a moment to come back
im angry because i want a mother not martha stewart
the superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife
thats not it
dont tell me you arent ashamed of that because i know
monica stares at her mother
i remember when i was eight years old you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal
all youd let me and lena do was set the table
and i guess you and dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas
and you didnt say anything
you just threw the whole meal into some tupper ware and tossed it in the fridge
i dont remember that
you never stood up for yourself
if i was ashamed it was because of that
whats ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his womans home cooking and ironing his drawers
camilles humiliation is immediate and she cuts off monica with a slap
camille curses herself for losing it
monica is stunned hurt
camille stares at her daughter devastated
is that really all you think of me
monica cant answer
camille contd when i married your father all i wanted was a nice house with a big kitchen so i could start my catering business
and then i got pregnant with lena and then i got pregnant with you
and i put it out of my mind because thats what you did
monica stares at her mother
camille contd but you want to know what day i remember
in high school you getting ready for the spring dance
i put my pearls around your neck told you you were beautiful and you looked like you were going to cry
that day i was happy i didnt have a catering business to run off to
my family had three meals a day had someone to pick up after them and when my daughters went to a dance i helped them get ready
thats what i came to care about
softly thats all you cared about
i must have played in a thousand games and i can only remember you being to two
you had your coaches and your father for that stuff
it never mattered one way or the other if i went to your games
it mattered mom
camille looks at her daughter and is struck by the need in her eyes
monica moves off the barstool and leaves
the room looks exactly the same
trophies medals plaques
basketball posters and her strong women wall
monica sits on her bed staring up at a photo of her and quincy tacked up to her bulletin board amid other photos of her childhood
they are eighteen playfully wrestling over a monica slowly rises starts taking her posters down
quincy sits on a leg extension machine with his left leg tucked under the padded bar
a trainer stands behind him
sweat and pain coat quincys face and scarred knee as he slowly lifts the light weight again and again and again
a long line of customers shift impatiently during the noon time rush
monica sits with a bank manager at the new accounts desk learning the ropes
her hair is done she wears a simple dress
behind her hanging on the wall are three framed photos of the bank presidents
one of them is her father monica stands in her room staring out at quincys window
she watches as quincy and kyra pack up some of quincys stuff
quincy tries to take his basketball globe light
she laughs hell no
camille enters moves to monicas garbage can dumps the contents into her larger bag
suddenly she stops
she reaches into the garbage and pulls out a crumpled picture
camille smooths it
it is the photo of monica and quincy at eighteen wrestling over a basketball
she sits down on monicas bed still staring
in the empty gym quincy jogs up and down the court
he is still tentative on his knee but he keeps jogging
and then slowly the determination melts from his face
his jog turns into a walk and then he just
quincy stands in the middle of his room taking in his life
old worn basketball posters still line the walls
trophies and awards
his basketball globe light
he walks to his window looks out at monicas window
her room is dark
quincy tilts his face up to the shower head and rinses the soap from his face
he hears the bathroom door open
he shuts off the water and opens the curtain
kyra sits on the toilet taking a pee
quincy slams the curtain closed
i dont wanna see that
get used to it babe
quincy steps out grabs a towel
a long scar runs across his knee cap
brothers gonna have to start locking doors
kyra laughs as she buttons up her flight attendants uniform
they cross into kyra packs up a suitcase
so how long is this trip
kyra contd so are you going to be the kind of husband who wont let his wife work
playfully why not
you might be the only one with a job
baby dont talk like that
your rehabs going well
youll be back before you know it
sometimes i wonder if its worth it
busting my ass for what
to do what you love
i dont know sometimes
youre just scared
i know rehab is hard and you have to worry about whether youll be as good as you were but you will be
i believe in you
you just have to get back on the court
like youd get back on a horse
beat a horse
dont make fun of me when im being wonderful and supportive
then you belong on the court
just like i belong in the stands looking cute and cheering you on
she smiles gives him a kiss moves back to her packing
off quincy monica sits at her desk in a blouse and skirt punching numbers into the computer
a man sits down in the chair opposite her
monica glances up
its her father
what are you doing here
i was upstairs for a meeting
ive been hearing good things about you
that tends to happen when youre the bosss daughter
so hows the job going
monica forces a smile
nathan looks at her nods
i think i know what the problem is
he pulls a garbage can hoop from a plastic shopping bag
he attaches it to her garbage can
nathan contd there
he shoots an ugly imaginary shot
you shoot like a girl
ill take that as a compliment
he gives her a smile and exits
monica looks at the hoop then crumples a piece of paper
whispering and she gets the steal
monica goes one on one against jordan she stops pops
the paper drops through the net
monica contd still whispering its good
she glances up notices a few patrons watching her
monica quickly composes herself and goes back to her work
monica exits her car after a long day at work
she wears very low heels
but she still stumbles
she curses then hears a laugh
she looks up quincy sits on the grassy hill above her house
i remember when your mom had to beat you into a dress
nods kyras gone for a couple days
figured id keep mom company
whos this guy i always see her around
hes alright kinda corny
hows the knee
strong enough to get you down the aisle
then i didnt get to send you an invitation but if you
im probably you know busy
can i ask you something
monica looks at him
quincy contd you never told me why ball isnt fun anymore
it just isnt
because im kinda feeling that way too
you had a rough couple years thats all
that a nice way of saying i rode the bench
and you tore up your knee
rehab is tough
i havent dribbled a ball in four and a half months
maybe i miss some of the attention but besides that
seems like i needed a ball when i was trying to be like my pops
or trying to be better than him
now i kinda think i need to try something else
maybe go back to school
monica stares at him seeing a man in the boy she grew up with
quincy looks away self conscious
i mean kyra hasnt heard the school thing yet
then shell probably say its the painkillers talking
its a trip you know
when youre a kid you see the life you want and it never crosses your mind that its not gonna turn out that way
so whyd you give up ball
why do you keep asking me that
cause i dont get it
something was just missing
monica is too hurt too scared to tell him the truth
it doesnt matter alright
just leave it alone
monica turns crosses to her house
she stumbles on her heels kicks them off in frustration and exits inside
quincy walks back to his curb
camille watches from the kitchen window lena sits next to camille
her one year old son l
sits on the ground at her feet
monica sits quietly nearby watching
so youre still breast feeding
the doctor said it was okay
anyway im still trying to lose some of this baby fat
she quickly looks over at monica
lena contd shut up
monica gives her a small smile
camille looks down at l
you might want to put a jacket on him its getting cold
lena sighs rolls her eyes
she picks up her son
come on l
grandma says its too cold
she exits inside
camille makes a face
and then silence
there is still so much distance between them so many misunderstanding
camille stares at her daughter
camille contd you know id probably be a lot more prissy in the situation than youd like but the thing i always admired that drove me crazy was the fight
you had in you
what are you talking about
when i said quincy could do better i was thinking about you
monica stares at her mom
camille stands and leaves
monica lies in her bed staring up at the ceiling unable to sleep
her mind races with thoughts of her past her choices her future
suddenly she climbs out of bed
she wears a tank top and pajama bottoms
she crosses to her window pulls it open and climbs out
monica drops down
she moves to quincys window and knocks quietly
beat then quincy appears
bare chested and in a pair of shorts
he looks at her then pulls open the window
half asleep whats going on
we need to talk
quincy just looks at her
monica contd please
quincy disappears for a moment then returns pulling on a t shirt
he climbs out of his window drops to the ground
quincy looks at her
you asked me what was missing
you woke me up to tell me that
its not fun for me anymore because youre missing
quincy stares at her
monica contd what im trying to say is i heard enough
what im trying to say is ive loved you since i was eleven and the shit wont go away
we havent talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this
i know i probably should have said it two weeks ago
quincy doesnt even crack a smile
in fact he glares
you havent changed
you still think the sun rises and sets on your ass
well guess what it doesnt
then why are you so upset
because you dont pull this on someone whos about to get married
better late than never right
quincy starts back toward the window
ill play you
one on one
quincy looks at her in disbelief then laughs at the absurdity
youre out of your mind
so youre gonna bitch up
whats that supposed to be psychology
i know why you broke up with me in college
and not that what you did wasnt messed up but what i did was too
so if you forgive me ill forgive you
monica after that stuff with my dad i couldnt trust anybody okay
i mean i was lost
so you are forgiven
but that was five years ago
i moved on
monica moves past him reaches through his window
she drops back down holding his basketball
she throws him the ball
what will this prove
you once said the reason i beat you was because you wanted me to
so if i win its because deep down you know youre about to make the biggest mistake of your life and deep down your want me to stop you
and what happens when you lose
if i lose ill buy you a wedding present
quincy stares at her
monica stands opposite quincy
both are suited up in basketball gear
they stare at each other ready to go to war
monica tosses him the ball
quincy tosses the ball back
quincys knee is maybe at sixty percent and he cant keep up
she scores easily
she walks to the top of the driveway tosses him the ball
monica contd one zip
quincy rubs his scarred knee then passes it back
the game continues
monica owns the first five points easily by exploiting quincys injury
monica drives for another lay up
quincy suddenly lets go of his fear leaps and swats her shot
he grabs the rebound and lays it up
he nods intensely as he grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key
the game continues and now quincy has the upper hand using his size and strength
he scores seven straight points
the score stays close
it is a sexually charged battle of wills quincy pulls off his sweat soaked shirt
their bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball
monica yanks off her jersey in frustration
her ass bumps into his hips as she backs him in
her hands slide across his chest as she guards him
finally the score hits nine nine
monica slowly walks to the top of the key
she tosses quincy the ball
monica contd check
quincy tosses the ball back drops low on defense
monica fakes an outside shot and quincy bites
monica drives around him
she has a wide open lay up
she puts it up
and it rolls off the rim
monica cant believe it
quincy grabs the loose ball and clears it
he stares at monica as he dribbles in front of her
she stares back
he breaks for the basket
monica stays with him
he goes up
monica jumps desperately tries to block his shot
quincy dunks on her knocking her to the ground
he lets go of the rim and tumbles to the ground also
quincy stares at her
monica looks back
then pointed alls fair in love and basketball right
monica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up
she slowly walks back toward her house
and then quincy contd hey
monica slowly stops turns
quincy contd double or nothing
monica stares at him wonders if she heard right
quincy limps to his feet picks up the ball and holds it out to her
monica slowly walks back to him
they stare at each other
no more egos no more bullshit
in the moonlight on the blacktop they kiss
music is blasting banners are waving crowd is screaming
magic johnson sits in a floor seat watching the game
a reporter interviews him
so magic are you contemplating another comeback
laughs no more comebacks
tonight im just enjoying being a spectator
behind him in a second row seat a one year black girl sits in a lap bouncing watching feet and legs ballin on the court
quincy leans down gives the little girl a kiss then looks out at the court
its the los angeles sparks and the new york liberty
on the court the women line up for a free throw
lets go mccall
monica sporting a uniform with wright mccall on the back and the number thirty two looks over
quincy takes their daughters hand and waves it
quincy contd go mommy
monica smiles back then steps to the line
the referee tosses her the ball
monica stares at the basket then bounces the ball twice licks her lips and shoots
