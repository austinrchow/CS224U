a screenplay by james cameron then two faint lights appear close together
they resolve into two deep submersibles free falling toward us like express elevators
one is ahead of the other and passes close enough to fill frame looking like a spacecraft blazing with lights bristling with insectile manipulators
tilting down to follow it as it descends away into the limitless blackness below
soon they are fireflies then stars
pushing in on one of the falling submersibles called mir one right up to its circular viewport to see the occupants
inside it is a cramped seven foot sphere crammed with equipment
anatoly mikailavich the subs pilot sits hunched over his controls
singing softly in russian
next to him on one side is brock lovett
hes in his late forties deeply tanned and likes to wear his nomex suit unzipped to show the gold from famous shipwrecks covering his gray chest hair
he is a wiley fast talking treasure hunter a salvage superstar who is part historian part adventurer and part vacuum cleaner salesman
right now he is propped against the co scrubber fast asleep and snoring
on the other side crammed into the remaining space is a bearded wide body named lewis bodine sho is also asleep
lewis is an r
remotely operated vehicle pilot and is the resident titanic expert
anatoly glances at the bottom sonar and makes a ballast adjustment
a pale dead flat lunar landscape
it gets brighter lit from above as mir one enters frame and drops to the seafloor in a downblast from its thrusters
it hits bottom after its two hour free fall with a loud bonk
lovett and bodine jerk awake at the landing
heavy russian accent we are here
minutes later the two subs skim over the seafloor to the sound of sidescan sonar and the thrum of big thrusters
the featureless gray clay of the bottom unrols in the lights of the subs
bodine is watching the sidescan sonar display where the outline of a huge pointed object is visible
anatoly lies prone driving the sub his face pressed to the center port
come left a little
shes right in front of us eighteen meters
you should see it
do you see it
i dont see it
out of the darkness like a ghostly apparition the bow of the ship appears
its knife edge prow is coming straight at us seeming to plow the bottom sediment like ocean waves
it towers above the seafloor standing just as it landed years ago
or what is left of her
mir one goes up and over the bow railing intact except for an overgrowth of rusticles draping it like mutated spanish moss
tight on the eyepiece monitor of a video camcorder
brock lovetts face fills the black and white frame
it still gets me every time
the image pans to the front viewport looking over anatolys shoulder to the bow railing visible in the lights beyond
is just your guilt because of estealing from the dead
cut wider to show that brock is operating the camera himself turning it in his hand so it points at his own face
work with me here
brock resumes his serious pensive gaze out the front port with the camera aimed at himself at arms length
it still gets me every time
to see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here where she landed at in the morning april after her long fall from the world above
anatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in russian
bodine chuckles and watches the sonar
you are so full of shit boss
mir two drives aft down the starboard side past the huge anchor while mir one passes over the seemingly endless forecastle deck with its massive anchor chains still laid out
in two neat rows its bronze windlass caps gleaming
the foot long subs are like white bugs next to the enormous wreck
here we are again on the deck of titanic
two and a half miles down
the pressure is three tons per square inch enough to crush us like a freight train going over an ant if our hull fails
these windows are nine inches thick and if they go its sayonara in two microseconds
mir two lands on the boat deck next to the ruins of the officers quarters
mir one lands on the roof of the deck hous nearby
lets go to work
bodine slips on a pair of d electronic goggles and grabs the joystick controls of the rov
outside the sub the rov a small orange and black robot called snoop dog lifts from its cradle and flies forward
walkin the dog
snoop dog drives itself away from the sub paying out its umbilical behind it like a robot yo yo
its twin stereo video cameras swivel like insect eyes
the rov descends through an open shaft that once was the beautiful first class grand staircase
snoop dog goes down several decks then moves laterally into the first class reception room
snoops video pov moving through the cavernous interior
the remains of the ornate handcarved woodwork which gave the ship its elegance move through the floodlights the lines blurred by slow dissolution and descending rusticle formations
stalactites of rust hang down so that at times it looks like a natural grotto then the scene shifts and the lines of a ghostly undersea mansion can be seen
montage style as snoop passes the ghostly images of titanics opulence a grand piano in amazingly good shape crashed on its side against a wall
the keys gleam black and white in the lights
a chandelier still hanging from the ceiling by its wire
glinting as snoop moves around it
its lights play across the floor revealing a champagne bottle then some white star line china
a womans high top granny shoe
then something eerie what looks like a childs skull resolves into the porcelain head of a doll
snoop enters a corridor which is much better preserved
here and there a door still hangs on its rusted hinges
an ornate piece of molding a wall sconce
hint at the grandeur of the past
the rov turns and goes through a black doorway entering room b the sitting room of a promenade suite one of the most luxurious staterooms on titanic
im in the sitting room
heading for bedroom b
stay off the floor
dont stir it up like you did yesterday
im tryin boss
glinting in the lights are the brass fixtures of the near perfectly preserved fireplace
an albino galathea crab crawls over it
nearby are the remains of a divan and a writing desk
the dog crosses the ruins of the once elegant room toward another door
it squeezes through the doorframe scraping rust and wood chunks loose on both sides
it moves out of a cloud of rust and keeps on going
im crossing the bedroom
the remains of a pillared canopy bed
broken chairs a dresser
through the collapsed wall of the bathroom the porcelain commode and bathtub took almost new gleaming in the dark
okay i want to see whats under that wardrobe door
several angles as the rov deploys its manipulator arms and starts moving debris aside
a lamp is lifted its ceramic colors as bright as they were in
take it slow
lewis grips a wardrobe door lying at an angle in a corner and pulls it with snoops gripper
it moves reluctantly in a cloud of silt
under it is a dark object
the silt clears and snoops cameras show them what was under the door
ooohh daddy oh are you seein what im seein
close on lovett watching his moniteors
by his expression it is like he is seeing the holy grail
oh baby baby baby
grabs the mike its payday boys
on the screen in the glare of the lights is the object of their quest a small steel combination safe
the safe dripping wet in the afternoon sun is lowered onto the deck of a ship by a winch cable
we are on the russian research vessel akademik mistislav keldysh
a crowd has gathered including most of the crew of keldysh the sub crews and a hand wringing money guy named bobby buell who represents the limited partners
there is also a documentary video crew hired by lovett to cover his moment of glory
everyone crowds around the safe
in the background mir two is being lowered into its cradle on deck by a massive hydraulic arm
mir one is already recovered with lewis bodine following brock lovett as he bounds over to the safe like a kid on christman morning
whos the best
you are lewis
to the video crew you rolling
brock nods to his technicians and they set about drilling the safes hinges
during this operation brock amps the suspense working the lens to fill the time
well here it is the moment of truth
heres where we find out if the time the sweat the money spent to charter this ship and these subs to come out here to the middle of the north
were worth it
if what we think is in that same
is in that safe
it will be
lovett grins wolfishly in anticipation of his greatest find yet
the door is pried loose
it clangs onto the deck
lovett moves closer peering into the safes wet interior
a long moment then
his face says it all
you know boss this happened to geraldo and his career never recovered
to the video cameraman get that outta my face
technicians are carefully removing some papers from the safe and placing them in a tray of water to separate them safely
nearby other artifacts from the stateroom are being washed and preserved
buell is on the satellite phone with the investors
lovett is yelling at the video crew
you send out what i tell you when i tell you
im signing your paychecks not minutes
now get set up for the uplink
buell covers the phone and turns to lovett
the partners want to know how its going
how its going
its going like a first date in prison whattaya think
lovett grabs the phone from buell and goes instantly smooth
look it wasnt in the safe
no look dont worry about it therere still plenty of places it could be
in the floor debris in the suite in the mothers room in the pursers safe on c deck
seeing something hang on a second
a tech coaxes some letters in the water tray to one side with a tong
revealing a pencil conte crayon drawing of a woman
brock looks closely at the drawing which is in excellent shape though its edges have partially disintegrated
the woman is beautiful and beautifully rendered
in her late teens or early twenties she is nude though posed with a kind of casual modesty
she is on an empire divan in a pool of light that seems to radiate outward from her eyes
scrawled in the lower right corner is the date april
and the initials jd
the girl is not entirely nude
at her throat is a diamond necklace with one large stone hanging in the center
lovett grabs a reference photo from the clutter on the lab table
it is a period black and white photo of a diamond necklace on a black velvet jellers display stand
he holds it next to the drawing
it is clearly the same piece
a complex setting with a massive central stone which is almost heart shaped
ill be god damned
a cnn news story a live satellite feed from the deck of the keldysh intercut with the cnn studio
treasure hunter brock lovett is best known for finding spanish gold in sunken galleons in the caribbean
now he is using deep submergence technology to work two and a half miles down at another famous wreck
he is with us live via satellite from a russian research ship in the middle of the atlantic
yes hi tracy
you know titanic is not just a shipwrick titanic is the shipwreck
its the mount everest of shipwrecks
pull back from the screen showing the cnn report playing on a tv set in the living room of a small rustic house
it is full of ceramics figurines folk art the walls crammed with drawings and paintings
things collected over a lifetime
panning to show a glassed in studio attached to the house
outside it is a quiet morning in ojai california
in the studio amid incredible clutter an ancient woman is throwing a pot on a potters wheel
the liquid red clay covers her hands
hands that are gnarled and age spotted but still surprisingly strong and supple
a woman in her early forties assists her
ive planned this expedition for three years and were out here recovering some amazing things
things that will have enormous historical and educational value
but its no secret that education is not your main purpose
youre a treasure hunter
so what is the treasure youre hunting
id rather show you than tell you and we think were very close to doing just that
the old womans name is rose calvert
her face is a wrinkled mass her body shapeless and shrunken under a one piece african print dress
but her eyes are just as bright and alive as those of a young girl
rose gets up and walks into the living room wiping pottery clay from her hands with a rag
a pomeranian dog gets up and comes in with her
the younger soman lizzy calvert rushes to help her
turn that up please dear
your expedition is at the center of a storm of controversy over salvage rights and even ethics
many are calling you a grave robber
nobody called the recovery of the artifacts from king tuts tomb grave robbing
i have museum trained experts here making sure this stuff is preserved and catalogued properly
look at this drawing which was found today
the video camera pans off brock to the drawing in a tray of water
the image of the woman with the necklace fills frame
a piece of paper thats been underwater for years
and my team are able to preserve it intanct
should this have remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity when we can see it and enjoy it now
rose is galvanized by this image
her mouth hangs open in amazement
ill be god damned
cut to keldysh
the mir subs are being launched
mir two is already in the water and lovett is getting ready to climb into mir one when bobby buell runs up to him
theres a satellite call for you
bobby were launching
see these submersibles here going in the water
take a message
no trust me you want to take this call
beull hands lovett the phone pushing down the blinking line
the call is from rose and we see both ends of the conversation
she is in her kitchen with a mystified lizzy
this is brock lovett
what can i do for you mrs
i was just wondering if you had found the heart of the ocean yet mr
brock almost drops the phone
bobby sees his shocked expression
i told you you wanted to take this call
to rose alright
you have my attention rose
can you tell me who the woman in the picture is
the woman in the picture is me
smash cut to an enormous sea stallion helicopter thundering across the ocean
pan degrees as it roars past
there is no land at either horizon
the keldysh is visible in the distance
close on a window of the monster helicopter
roses face is visible looking out calmly
brock and bodine are watching mir being sweng over the side to start a dive
shes a goddamned liar
whats her name
that anastasia babe
brock nods and the three of them head forward to meet the approaching helo
she says shes rose dewitt bukater right
rose dewitt bukater died on the titanic
at the age of
if shedve lived shed be over a hundred now
a hundred and one next month
okay so shes a very old goddamned liar
i traced her as far back as the s
she was working as an actress in l
her name was rose dawson
then she married a guy named calvert moved to cedar rapids had two kids
now calverts dead and from what ive heard cedar rapids is dead
the sea stallion approaches the ship bg forcing brock to yell over the rotors
and everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead
or on this ship
but she knows about it
and i want to hear what she has to say
in a thundering downblast the helicopters wheels bounce down on the helipad
lovett buell and bodine watch as the helicopter crew chief hands out about ten suitcases and then rose is lowered to the deck in a wheelchair by keldysh crewmen
lizzy ducking unnecessarily under the rotor follows her out carrying freddy the pomeranian
the crew chief hands a puzzled keldysh crewmember a goldfish bowl with several fish in it
rose does not travel light
hold on the incongruous image of this little old lady looking impossibly fragile amongst all the high tech gear grungy deck crew and gigantic equipment
scuse me i have to go check our supply of depends
lizzy is unpacking roses things in the small utilitarian room
rose is placing a number of framed photos on the bureau arranging them carefully next to the fishbowl
brock and bodine are in the doorway
is your stateroom alright
have you met my granddaughter lizzy
she takes care of me
we met just a few minutes ago grandma
remember up on deck
brock glances at bodine
bodine rolls his eyes
rose finishes arranging her photographs
we get a general glimpse of them the usual snapshots
children and grandchildren her late husband
there thats nice
i have to have my pictures when i travel
and freddy of course
to the pomeranian isnt that right sweetie
would you like anything
i should like to see my drawing
rose looks at the drawing in its tray of water confronting herself across a span of years
until they can figure out the best way to preserve it they have to keep it immersed
it sways and ripples almost as if alive
tight on roses ancient eyes gazing at the drawing
flashcut of a mans hand holding a conte crayon deftly creating a shoulder and the shape of her hair with two efficient lines
the womans face in the drawing dancing under the water
a flashcut of a mans eyes just visible over the top of a sketching pad
they look up suddenly right into the lens
soft eyes but fearlessly direct
rose smiles remembering
brock has the reference photo of the necklace in his hand
louis the sixteenth wore a fabulous stone called the blue diamond of the crown which disappeared in about the time louis lost everything from the neck up
the theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too
recut into a heart like shape
and it became le coeur de la mer
the heart of the ocean
today it would be worth more than the hope diamond
it was a dreadful heavy thing
she points at the drawing i only wore it this once
you actually believe this is you grandma
it is me dear
wasnt i a hot number
i tracked it down through insurance records
and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy
do you know who the claiment was rost
someone named hockley i should imagine
nathan hockley right
pittsburgh steel tycoon
for a diamond necklace his son caledon hockley bought in france for his fiancee
a week before he sailed on titanic
and the claim was filed right after the sinking
so the diamond had tove gone down with the ship
to lizzy see the date
if your grandma is who she says she is she was wearing the diamond the day titanic sank
to rose and that makes you my new best friend
i will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery
i dont want your money mr
i know how hard it is for people who care greatly for money to give some away
skeptical you dont want anything
indicating the drawing you may give me this if anything i tell you is of value
crossing the room over here are a few things weve recovered from your staterooms
laid out on a worktable are fifty or so objects from mundane to valuable
rose shrunken in her chair can barely see over the table top
with a trembling hand she lifts a tortoise shell hand mirror inlaid with mother of pearl
she caresses it wonderingly
this was mine
it looks the same as the last time i saw it
she turns the mirror over and looks at her ancient face in the cracked glass
the reflection has changed a bit
she spies something else a silver and moonstone art nouveau brooch
my mothers brooch
she wanted to go back for it
caused quite a fuss
rose picks up an ornate art nouveau hair comb
a jade butterfly takes flight on the ebony handle of the comb
she turns it slowly remembering
we can see that rose is experiencing a rush of images and emotions that have lain dormant for eight decades as she handles the butterfly comb
are you ready to go back to titanic
it is a darkened room lined with tv monitors
images of the wreck fill the screens fed from mir one and two and the two rovs snoop dog and duncan
live from feet
rose stares raptly at the screens
she is enthraled by one in particular an image of the bow railing
it obviously means something to her
brock is studying her reactions carefully
the bows struck in the bottom like an axe from the impact
i can run a simulation we worked up on this monitor over here
lizzy turns the chair so rose can see the screen of bodines computer
as he is calling up the file he keeps talking
weve put together the worlds largest database on the titanic
rose might not want to see this lewis
bodine starts a computer animated graphic on the screen which parallels his rapid fire narration
she hits the berg on the starboard side and it sort of bumps along
punching holes like a morse code
dit dit dit down the side
now shes flooding in the bodine contd forward compartments
and the water spills over the tops of the bulkheads going aft
as her bow is going down her stern is coming up
slow at first
and then faster and faster until its lifting all that weight maybe or thousand tons
out of the water and the hull cant deal
making a sound in time with the animation it splits
right down to the keel which acts like a big hinge
now the bow swings down and the stern falls back level
but the weight of the bow pulls the stern up vertical and then the bow section detaches heading for the bottom
the stern bobs like a cork floods and goes under about a
two hours and forty minutes after the collision
the animation then follows the bow section as it sinks
rose watches this clinical dissection of the disaster without emotion
the bow pulls out of its dive and planes away almost a half a mile before it hits the bottom going maybe miles an hour
the bow impacts digging deeply into the bottom the animation now follows the stern
the stern implodes as it sinks from the pressure and rips apart from the force of the current as it falls landing like a big pile of junk
indicating the simulation cool huh
thank you for that fine forensic analysis mr
of course the experience of it was somewhat less clinical
will you share it with us
her eyes go back to the screens showing the sad ruins far below them
a view from one of the subs tracking slowly over the boat deck
rose recognizes one of the wellin davits still in place
she hears ghostly waltz music
the faint and echoing sound of an officers voice english accented calling women and children only
flash cuts of screaming faces in a running crowd
pandemonium and terror
people crying praying kneeling on the deck
flashes in the dark
rose looks at another monitor
snoop dog moving down a rusted debris filled corridor
rose watches the endless row of doorways sliding past like dark mouths
image of a child three years old standing ankle deep in water in the middle of an endless corridor
the child is lost alone crying
rose is shaken by the flood of memories and emotions
her eyes well up and she puts her head down sobbing quietly
taking the wheelchair im taking her to rest
her voice is surprisingly strong
the sweet little old lady is gone replaced by a woman with eyes of steel
lovett signals everyone to stay quiet
tell us rose
she looks from screen to screen the images of the ruined ship
its been years
just tell us what you can holds up her hand for silence its been years
and i can still smell the fresh paint
the china had never been used
the sheets had never been slept in
he switches on the minirecorder and sets it near her
titanic was called the ship of dreams
and it was
it really was
as the underwater camera rises past the rusted bow rail we dissolve match move to that same railing in
shot continues in a florious reveal as the gleaming white superstructure of titanic rises mountainously beyond the rail and above that the buff colored funnels stand against the sky like
the pillars of a great temple
crewmen move across the deck dwarfed by the awesome scale of the steamer
southanmpton england april
it is almost nnon on ailing day
a crowd of hundreds blackens the pier next to titanic like ants on a jelly sandwich
in fg a gorgeous burgundy renault touring car swings into frame hanging from a loading crane
it is lowered toward hatch
on the pier horsedrawn vehicles motorcars and lorries move slowly through the dense throng
the atmosphere is one of excitement and general giddiness
people embrace in tearful farewells or wave and shout bon voyage wishes to friends and relatives on the decks above
a white renault leading a silver gray daimler benz pushes through the crowd leaving a wake in the press of people
around the handsome cars people are streaming to board the ship jostling with hustling seamen and stokers porters and barking white star line officials
the renault stops and the liveried driver scurries to open the door for a young woman dressed in a stunning white and purple outfit with an enormous feathered hat
she is years old and beautiful regal of bearing with piercing eyes
it is the girl in the drawing
she looks up at the ship taking it in with cool appraisal
i dont see what all the fuss is about
it doesnt look any bigger than the mauretania
a personal valet opens the door on the other side of the car for caledon hockley the year old heir to the elder hockleys fortune
cal is handsome arrogant and rich beyond meaning
you can be blase about some things rose but not about titanic
its over a hundred feet longer than mauretania and far more luxurious
it has squash courts a parisian cafe
even turkish baths
cal turns and fives his hand to roses mother ruth dewitt bukater who descends from the touring car being him
ruth is a ish society empress from one of the most prominent philadelphia families
she is a widow and rules her household with iron will
your daughter is much too hard to impress ruth
indicating a puddle mind your step
gazing at the leviathan so this is the ship they say is unsinkable
it is unsinkable
god himself couldnt sink this ship
cal speaks with the pride of a host providing a special experience
this entire entourage of rich americans is impeccably turned out a quintessential example of the edwardian upper class complete with servants
cals valet spicer lovejoy is a tall and impassive dour as an undertaker
behind him emerge two maids personal servants to ruth and rose
a white star line porter scurries toward them harried by last minute loading
sir youll have to check your baggage through the main terminal round that way cal nonchalantly hands the man a fiver
the porters eyes dilate
five pounds was a monster tip in those days
i put my faith in you good sir
curtly indicating lovejoy see my man
my pleasure sir
cal never tires of the effect of money on the unwashed masses
to the porter these trunks here and more in the daimler
well have all this lot up in the rooms
the white star man looks stricken when he sees the enormous pile of steamer trunks and suitcases loading down the second car including wooden crates and steel safe
he whistles frantically for some cargo handlers nearby who come running
cal breezes on leaving the minions to scramble
he quickly checks his pocket watch
wed better hurry
this way ladies
he indicates the way toward the first class gangway
they move into the crowd
trudy bolt roses maid hustles behind them laden with bags of her mistresss most recent purchases
things too delicate for the baggage handlers
cal leads weaving between vehicles and handcarts hurrying passengers mostly second class and steerage and well wishers
most of the first class passengers are avoiding the smelly press of the dockside crowd by using an elevated boarding bridge twenty feet above
they pass a line of steerage passengers in their coarse wool and tweeds queued up inside movable barriers like cattle in a chute
a health officer examines their heads one by one checking scalp and eyelashes for lice
they pass a well dressed young man cranking the handle of a wooden biograph cinematograph camera mounted on a tripod
naniel marvin whose father founded the biograph film studio is filming his young bride in front of the titanic
mary marvin stands stiffly and smiles self conscious
look up at the ship darling thats it
you cant believe how big it is
like a mountain
mary marvin without an acting fiber in her body does a bad clara bow pantomime of awe hands raised
cal is jostled by two yelling steerage boys who shove past him
and he is bumped again a second later by the boys father
the cockney father pushes on after his kids shouting
apparently missed his annual bath
honestly cal if you werent forever booking everything at the last instant we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family
all part of my charm ruth
at any rate it was my darling fiancees beauty rituals which made us late
you told me to change
i couldnt let you wear black on sailing day sweetpea
its bad luck
i felt like black
cal guides them out of the path of a horse drawn wagon loaded down with two tons of oxford marmalade in wooden cases for titanics victualling department
here ive pulled every string i could to book us on the grandest ship in history in her most luxurious suites
and you act as if youre going to your execution
rose looks up as the hull of titanic looms over them
a great iron wall bible black and sever
cal motions her forward and she enters the gangway to the d deck doors with a sense of overwhelming dread
it was the ship of dreams
to everyone else
to me it was a slave ship taking me back to america in chains
close on cals hand in slow motion as it closes possessively over roses arm
he escorts her up the gangway and the black hull of titanic swallows them
outwardly i was everything a well brought up girl should be
inside i was screaming
cut to a screaming blast from the mighty triple steam horns on titanics funnels bellowing their departure warning
a view of titanic from several blocks away towering above the terminal buildings like the skyline of a city
the steamers whistle echoes across southampton
pull back revealing that we were looking through a window and back further to show the smoky inside of a pub
it is crowded with dockworkers and ship s crew
just inside the window a poker game is in progress
four men in working class clothes play a very serious hand
jack dawson and fabrizio de rossi both about exchange a glance as the other two players argue in swedish
jack is american a lanky drifter with his hair a little long for the standards of the times
he is also unshaven and his clothes are rumpled from sleeping in them
he is an artist and has adopted the bohemian style of art scene in paris
he is also very self possessed and sure footed for having lived on his own since
the two swedes continue their sullen argument in swedish
subtitled you stupid fishhead
i cant believe you bet our tickets
subtitled you lost our money
im just trying to get it back
now shutup and take a card
jaunty hit me again sven
jack takes the card and slips it into his hand
ecu jacks eyes
they betray nothing
close on fabrizio licking his lips nervously as he refuses a card
ecu stack in the middle of the table
bills and coins from four counrties
this has been going on for a while
sitting on top of the money are two rd class tickets for rms titanic
the titanics whistle blows again
the moment of truth boys
somebodys lifes about to change
fabrizio puts his cards down
so do the swedes
jack holds his close
fabrizios got niente
olaf youve got squat
sven uh oh
turns to his friend sorry fabrizio
what you got
you lose my money
ma va fan culo testa di cazzo sorry youre not gonna see your mama again for a long time
he slaps a full house down on the table
grinning cause youre goin to america
full house boys
the table explodes into shouting in several languages
jack rakes in the money and the tickets
to the swedes sorry boys
three of a kind and a pair
im high and youre dry and
to fabrizio were going to olaf balls up one huge farmers fist
we think hes going to clobber jack but he swings round and punches sven who flops backward onto the floor and sits there looking depressed
olaf forgets about jack and fabrizio who are dancing around and goes into a rapid harangue of his stupid cousin
jack kisses the tickets then jumps on fabrizios back and rides him around the pub
its like they won the lottery
to the land o the free and the home of the real hot dogs
on the titanic
were ridin in high style now
were practically goddamned royalty ragazzo mio
is my destinio
like i told you
i go to lamerica
to be a millionaire

i go to america
titanic go to america
in five minutes
come on fabri
grabbing their stuff come on
to all grinning its been grand
they run for the door
course im sure if they knew it was you lot comin theyd be pleased to wait
jack and fabrizio carrying everything they own in the world in the kit bags on their shoulders sprint toward the pier
they tear through milling crowds next to the terminal
shouts go up behind them as they jostle slow moving gentlemen
they dodge piles of luggage and weave through groups of people
they burst out onto the pier and jack comes to a dead stop
staring at the cast wall of the ships hull towering seven stories above the wharf and over an eighth of a mile long
the titanic is monstrous
fabrizio runs back and grabs jack and they sprint toward the third class gangway aft at e deck
they reach the bottom of the ramp just as sixth officer moody detaches it at the top
it starts to swing down from the gangway doors
flushed and panting he waves the tickets
have you been through the inspection queue
lying cheerfully of course
anyway we dont have lice were americans
glances at fabrizio both of us
testy right come aboard
moody has quartermaster rowe reattach the gangway
jack and fabrizio come aboard
moody glances at the tickets then passes jack and fabrizio through to rowe
rowe looks at the names on the tickets to enter them in the passenger list
reading fabrizios gundersen
he hands the tickets back eyeing fabrizios mediterranean looks suspiciously
grabbing fabrizios arm come on sven
jack and fabrizio whoop with victory as they run down the white painted corridero
grinning from ear to ear
we are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world
the mooring lines as big around as a mans arm are dropped into the water
a cheer goes up on the pier as seven tugs pull the titanic away from the quay
jack and fabrizio burst through a door onto the aft well deck
tracking with them as they run across the deck and up the steel stairs to the poop deck
they get to the rail and jack starts to yell and wave to the crowd on the dock
you know somebody
of course not
thats not the point
to the crowd goodbye
ill miss you
grinning fabrixio joins in adding his voice to the swell of voices feeling the exhilaration of the moment
i will never forget you
the crowd of cheering well wishers waves heartily as a black wall of metal moves past them
impossibly tiny figues wave back from the ships rails
titanic gathers speed
in a long lens shot the prow of titanic fills frame behind the lead tug which is dwarfed
the bow wave spreads before the mighty plow of the liners hull as it moves down the river test toward the english channel
jack and fabrizio walk down a narrow corridor with doors lining both sides like a college dorm
total confusion as people argue over luggage in several languages or wander in confusion in the labyrinth
they pass emigrants studying the signs over the doors and looking up the words in phrase books
they find their berth
it is a modest cubicle painted enamel white with four bunks
exposed pipes overhead
the other two guys are already there
olaus and bjorn gundersen
jack throws his kit on one open bunk while fabrizio takes the other
in swedish subtitled where is sven
by contrast the so called millionaire suite is in the empire style and comprises two bedrooms a bath wc wardrobe room and a large sitting room
in addition there is a private foot promenade deck outside
a room service waiter pours champagne into a tulip glass of orange juice and hands the bucks fizz to rose
she is looking through her new paintings
there is a monet of water lilies a degas of dancers and a few abstract works
they are all unknown paintings
cal is out on the covered deck which has potted trees and vines on trellises talking through the doorway to rose in the sitting room
those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money
looking at a cubist portrait youre wrong
like in a dream
theres truth without logic
whats his name again
reading off the canvas picasso
coming into the sitting room hell never amount to a thing trust me
at least they were cheap
a porter wheels cals private safe which we recognize into the room on a handtruck
put that in the wardrobe
in the bedroom rose enters with the large degas of the dancers
she sets it on the dresser near the canopy bed
trudy is already in there hanging up some of roses clothes
it smells so brand new
like they built it all just for us
just to think that tonight when i crawl between the sheets iill be the first cal appears in the doorway of the bedroom
looking at rose and when i crawl between the sheets tonight ill still be the first
blushing at the innuendo scuse me miss
she edges around cal and makes a quick exit
cal comes up behind rose and puts his hands on her shoulders
an act of possession not intimacy
the first and only
roses expression shows how bleak a prospect this is for her now
titanic stands silhouetted against a purple post sunset sky
she is lit up like a floating palace and her thousand portholes reflect in the calm harbor waters
the foot tender nomadic lies to alongside looking like a rowboat
the lights of a cherbourg harbor complete the postcard image
entering the first class reception room from the tender are a number of prominent passengers
a broad shouldered woman in an enormous feathered hat comes up the gangway carrying a suitcase in each hand a spindly porter running to catch up with her to take
well i wasnt about to wait all day for you sonny
take em the rest of the way if you think you can manage
at cherbourg a woman came aboard named margaret brown but we all called her molly
history would call her the unsinkable molly brown
her husband had struck gold someplace out west and she was what mother called new money
at molly brown is a tough talking straightshooter who dresses in the finery of her genteel peers but will never be one of them
by the next afternoon we had made our final stop and we were steaming west from the coast of ireland with nothing out ahead of us but ocean
the ship glows with the warm creamy light of late afternoon
jack and fabrizio stand right at the bow gripping the curving railing so familiar from images of the wreck
jack leans over looking down fifty feet to where the prow cuts the surface like a knife sending up two glassy sheets of water
on the bridge captain smith turns from the binnacle to first officer take her to sea mister murdoch
lets stretch her legs
murdoch moves the engine telegraph lever to all ahead full
now begins a kind of musical visual setpiece
an ode to the great ship
the music is rhythmic surging forward with a soaring melody that addresses the majesty and optimism of the ship of dreams
in the engine room the telegraph clangs and moves to all ahead full
all ahead full
on the catwalk thomas andrews the shipbuilder watches carefully as the engineers and greasers scramble to adjust valves
towering above them are the twin reciprocating engines four stories tall their ten foot long connecting rods surging up and down with the turning of the massive crankshafts
the engines thunder like the footfalls of marching giants
in the boiler rooms the stokers chant a song as they hurl coal into the roaring furnaces
the black gang are covered with sweat and coal dust their muscles working like part of the machinery as they toil in the hellish glow
underwater the enormous bronze screws chop through the water hurling the steamer forward and churning up a vortex of foam that lingers for miles behind the juggernaut ship
smoke pours from the funnels as the riven water flares higher at the bow as the ships speeds builds
the camera sweeps up the prow to find jack the wind streaming through his hair and captain smith steps out of the enclosed bridge onto the wing
he stands with his hands on the rail looking every bit the storybook picture of a captain
a great patriarch of the sea
twenty one knots sir
shes got a bone in her teeth now eh mr
smith accepts a cup of tea from fifth officer lowe
he contentedly watches the white v of water hurled outward from the bows like an expression of his own personal power
they are invulnerable towering over the sea
at the bow jack and fabrizio lean far over looking down
in the glassy bow wave two dolphins appear under the water running fast just in front of the steel blade of the prow
they do it for the sheer joy and exultation of motion
jack watches the dolphins and grins
they breach jumping clear of the water and then dive back crisscrossing in front of the bow dancing ahead of the juggernaut
fabrizio looks forward across the atlantic staring into the sunsparkles
i can see the statue of liberty already
grinning at jack very small
the camera arcs around them until they are framed against the sea
now we pull back across the forecastle deck
rising as we continue back and the ships rolls endlessly forward underneath
over the bridge wing along the boat deck until her funnels come into frame besides us and march past like the pillars of heaven one by one
we pull back and up until we are looking down the funnels and the people strolling on the decks and standing at the rail become antlike
and still we pull back until the great lady is seen whole in a gorgeous aerial portrait black and severe in her majesty
she is the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man in all history
close on j
bruce ismay managing director of white star line
and our master shipbuilder mr
andrews here designed her from the keel plates up
he indicates a handsome year old irish gentlemen to his right thomas andrews of harland and wolf shipbuilders
wider showing the group assembled for lunch the next day
ismay seated with cal rose ruth molly brown and thomas andrews in the palm court a beautiful sunny spot enclosed by high arched windows
disliking the attention well i may have knocked her together but the idea was mr
he envisioned a steamer so grand in scale and so luxurious in its appointments that its supremacy would never be challenged
and here she is
he slaps the table willed into solid reality
whyre ships always bein called she
is it because men think half the women around have big sterns and should be weighed in tonnage
they all laugh just another example of the men settin the rules their way
the waiter arrives to take orders
rose lights a cigarette
you know i dont like that rose
cal takes the cigarette from her and stubs it out
to the waiter well both have the lamb
rare with a little mint sauce
to rose after the waiter moves away you like lamb dont you sweetpea
molly is watching the dynamic between rose cal and ruth
so you gonna cut her meat for her too there cal
turning to ismay hey who came up with the name titanic
i wanted to convey sheer size
and size means stability luxury
and safety do you know of dr
his ideas about the male preoccupation with size might be of particular interest to you mr
andrews chockes on his breadstick suppressing laughter
my god rose whats gotten into excuse me
she stalks away
mortified i do apologize
shes a pistol cal
you sure you can handle her
tense but feigning unconcern well i may have to start minding what she reads from now on
jack sits on a bench in the sun
titanics wake spreads out behind him to the horizon
he has his knees pulled up supporting a leather bound sketching pad his only valuable possession
with conte crayon he draws rapidly using sure strokes
an emigrant from manchester named cartmell has his year old daughter cora standing on the lower rung of the rail
she is leaned back against his beer barrel of a stomach watching the seagulls
the sketch captures them perfectly with a great sense of the humanity of the moment
jack is good
fabrizio looks over jacks shoulder
he nods appreciatively
tommy ryan a scowling young irish emigrant watches as a crewmember comes by walking three small dogs around the deck
one of them a black french bulldog is among the ugliest creatures on the planet
first class dogs come down here to take a shit
jack looks up from his sketch
thats so we know where we rank in the scheme of things
like we could forget
jack glances across the well deck
at the aft railing of b deck promenade stands rose in a long yellow dress and white gloves
close on jack unable to take his eyes off of her
they are across from each other about feet apart with the well deck like a valley between them
she on her promontory he on his much lower one
she stares down at the water
he watches her unpin her elaborate hat and take it off
she looks at the frilly absurd thing then tosses it over the rail
it sails far down to the water and is carried away astern
a spot of yellow in the vast ocean
he is riveted by her
she looks like a figure in a romantic novel sad and isolated
fabrizio taps tommy and they both look at jack gazin at rose
fabrizio and tommy grin at each other
rose turns suddenly and looks right at jack
he is caught staring but he doesnt look away
she does but then looks back
their eyes meet across the space of the well deck across the gulf between worlds
jack sees a man cal come up behind her and take her arm
she jerks her arm away
they argue in pantomime
she storms away and he goes after her disappearing along the a deck promenade
jack stares after her
forget it boyo
youd as like have angels fly out o yer arse as get next to the likes o her
slowly pushing in on rose as she sits flanked by people in heated conversation
cal and ruth are laughing together while on the other side lady duff gordon is holding forth animatedly
we dont hear what they are saying
rose is staring at her plate barely listening to the inconsequential babble around her
i saw my whole life as if id already lived it
an endless parade of parties and cotillions yachts and polo matches
always the same narrow people the same mindless chatter
i felt like i was standing at a great precipice with no one to pull me back no one who cared
or even noticed
angle beneath table showing roses hand holding a tiny fork from her crab salad
she pokes the crab fork into the skin of her arm harder and harder until it draws blood
rose walks along the corridor
a steward coming the other way greets her and she nods with a slight smile
she is perfectly composed
she enters the room
stands in the middle staring at her reflection in the large vanity mirror
just stands there then with a primal anguished cry she claws at her throat ripping off her pearl necklace which explodes across the room
in a frenzy she tears at herself her clothes her hair
then attacks the room
she flings everything off the dresser and it flies clattering against the wall
she hurls a handmirror against the vanity cracking it
rose runs along the b deck promenade
she is dishevelled her hair flying
she is crying her cheeks streaked with tears
but also angry furious
shaking with emotions she doesnt understand
hatred self hatred desperation
a strolling couple watch her pass
shocked at the emotional display in public
jack is kicked back on one of the benches gazing at the stars blazing gloriously overhead
thinking artist thoughts and smoking a cigarette
hearing something he turns as rose runs up the stairs from the well deck
they are the only two on the stern deck except for quartermaster rowe twenty feet above them on the docking bridge catwalk
she doesnt see jack in the shadows and runs right past him
tracking with rose as she runs across the deserted fantail
her breath hitches in an occasional sob which she suppresses
rose slams against the base of the stern flagpole and clings there panting
she stares out at the black water
then starts to climb over the railing
she has to hitch her long dress way up and climbing is clumsy
moving methodically she turns her body and gets her heels on the white painted gunwale her back to the railing facing out toward blackness
feet below her the massive propellers are churning the atlantin into white foam and a ghostly wake trails off toward the horizon
in a low angle we see rose standing like a figurehead in reverse
below her are the huge letters of the name titanic
she leans out her arms straightening
looking down hypnotized into the vortex below her
her dress and hair are lifted by the wind of the ships movement
the only sound above the rush of water below is the flutter and snap of the big union jack right above her
dont do it
she whips her head around at the sound of his voice
it takes a second for her eyes to focus
dont come any closer
jack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow from the stern running lights
take my hand
ill pull you back in
stay where you are
i mean it
ill let go
no you wont
what do you mean no i wont
dont presume to tell me what i will and will not do
you dont know me
you would have done it already
now come on take my hand
rose is confused now
she cant see him very well through the tears so she wipes them with one hand almost losing her balance
youre distracting me
im involved now
if you let go i have to jump in after you
dont be absurd
youll be killed
he takes off his jacket
im a good swimmer
he starts unlacing his left shoe
the fall alone would kill you
it would hurt
im not saying it wouldnt
to be honest im a lot more concerned about the water being so cold
she looks down
the reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in
taking off his left shoe freezing
maybe a couple degrees over
he starts unlacing his right shoe
ever been to wisconsin
well they have some of the coldest winters around and i grew up there near chippewa falls
once when i was a kid me and my father were ice fishing out on lake wissota
ice fishings where you chop a hole in the i know what ice fishing is
you look like kind of an indoor girl
anyway i went through some thin ice and im tellin ya water that cold
like that right down there
it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body
you cant breath you cant think
least not about anything but the pain
takes off his other shoe which is why im not looking forward to jumping in after you
but like i said i dont see a choice
i guess im kinda hoping youll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here
thats what everybody says
but with all due respect im not the one hanging off the back of a ship
he slides one step closer like moving up on a spooked horse
you dont want to do this
give me your hand
rose stares at this madman for a long time
she looks at his eyes and they somehow suddenly seem to fill her universe
she unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him
he reaches out to take it firmly
im jack dawson
voice quavering pleased to meet you mr
rose starts to turn
now that she has decided to live the height is terrifying
she is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing turning to face the ship
as she starts to climb her dress gets in the way and one foot slips off the edge of the deck
she plunges letting out a piercing shriek
jack gripping her hand is jerked toward the rail
rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand
quartermaster rowe up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads for the ladder
ive got you
i wont let go
jack holds her hand with all his strength bracing himself on the railing with his other hand
rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smooth hull
jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing
she cant get any footing in her dress and evening shoes and she slips back
rose screams again
jack awkwardly clutching rose by whatever he can get a grip on as she flails gets her over the railing
they fall together onto the deck in a tangled heap spinning in such a way that jack winds up slightly on top of her
rowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like its a fire drill and sprints across the fantail
here whats all this
rowe runs up and pulls jack off of rose revealing her dishevelled and sobbing on the deck
her dress is torn and the hem is pushing up above her knees showing one ripped stocking
he looks at jack the shaggy steerage man with his jacket off and the first class lady clearly in distress and starts drawing conclusions
two seamen chug across the deck to join them
to jack here you stand back
dont move an inch
to the seamen fetch the master at arms
a few minutes later
jack is being detained by the burly master at arms the closest thing to a cop on board
he is handcuffing jack
cal is right in front of jack and furious
he has obviously just rushed out here with lovejoy and another man and none of them have coats over their black tie evening dress
the other man is colonel archibald gracie a mustachioed blowhard who still has his brandy snifter
he offers it to rose who is hunched over crying on a bench nearby but she waves it away
cal is more concerned with jack
he grabs him by the lapels
what made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee
look at me you filth
what did you think you were doing
it was an accident
i was leaning over and i slipped
rose looks at jack getting eye contact
i was leaning way over to see the
and i slipped and i would have gone overboard
dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself
you wanted to see the propellers
shaking his head women and machinery do not mix
to jack was that the way of it
rose is begging him with her eyes not to say what really happened
that was pretty much it
he looks at rose a moment longer
now they have a secret together
the boys a hero then
good for you son well done
to cal so its alls well and back to our brandy eh
jack is uncuffed
cal gets rose to her feet and moving
rubbing her arms lets get you in
cal is leaving without a second thought for jack
perhaps a little something for the boy
a twenty should do it
is that the going rate for saving the woman you love
rose is displeased
what to do
cal turns back to jack
he appraises him condescendingly
a steerage ruffian unwashed and ill mannered
to jack perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow to regale our group with your heroic tale
looking straight at rose sure
count me in
cal turns to go putting a protective arm around rose
he leans close to gracie as they walk away
this should be amusing
as lovejoy passes can i bum a cigarette
lovejoy smoothly draws a silver cigarette case from his jacket and snaps it open
jack takes a cigarette then another popping it behind his ear for later
lovejoy lights jacks cigarette
youll want to tie those
jack looks at his shoes interesting that the young lady slipped so mighty all of a sudden and you still had time to take of your jacket and shoes
lovejoys expression is bland but the eyes are cold
he turns away to join his group
as she undresses for bed rose sees cal standing in her doorway reflected in the cracked mirror of her vanity
he comes toward her
unexpectedly tender i know youve een melancholy and i dont pretent to know why
from behind his back he hands her a large black velvet jewel case
she takes it numbly
i intended to save this till the engagement gals next week
but i thought tonight perhaps a reminder of my feeling for you
rose slowly opens the box
inside is the necklace
heart of the ocean in all its glory
it is huge
a malevolent blue stone glittering with an infinity of scalpel like inner reflections
is it a daimond
yes it is
he takes the necklace and during the following places it around her throat
he turns her to the mirror staring behind her
it was once worn by louis the sixteenth
they call it le coeur de la mer the the heart of the ocean
he gazes at the image of the two of them in the mirror
its for royalty
and we are royalty
his fingers caress her neck and throat
he seems himself to be disarmed by roses elegance and beauty
his emotion is for the first time unguarded
theres nothing i couldnt give you
theres nothing id deny you if you would deny me
open your heart to me rose
camera begins to track in on rose
closer and closer during the following of course his gift was only to reflect light back onto himself to illuminate the greatness that was caledon hockley
it was a cold stone
a heart of ice
finally when roses eyes fill fram we morph slowly to her eyes as the are now
transforming through years of life
without a cut the wrinkled weathered landscape of age has appeared around her eyes
but the eyes themselves are the same
after all these years feel it closing around my throat like a dog collar
the camera pulls back to show her whole face
i can still feel its weight
if you could have felt it not just seen it
well thats the general idea my dear
so let me get this right
you were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the titanic
he guffaws thats great
but rose laughs with bodine
still laughing all you had to do was wait two days
lovett standing out of roses sightline checks his watch
hours have passed
this process is taking too long
rose tell us more about the diamond
what did hockley do with it after that
im afraid im feeling a little tired mr
lizzy picks up the cue and starts to wheel her out
can you give us something go on here
like who had access to the safe
what about this lovejoy guy
did he have the combination
lizzy takes her out
roses old hand reapears at the doorway in a frail wave goodbye
as the big hydraulic jib swings one of the mir subs out over the water
lovett walks as he talks with bobby buell the partners rep
they weave among deck cranes launch crew sub maintenance guys
the partners are pissed
bobby buy me time
i need time
were running thirty thousand a day and were six days over
im telling you what theyre telling me
the hand is on the plug
its starting to pull
well you tell the hand i need another two days
bobby bobby bobby
i smell it
i smell ice
she had the diamond on
now we just have to find out where it wound up
i just gotta work her a bit more
brock turns and sees lizy standing behind him
she has overheard the past part of his dialogue with buell
he goes to her and hustles her away from buell toward a quite spot on the deck
i need to talk to you for a second
dont you mean work me
look im running out of time
i need your help
im not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother
i came down here to tell you to back off
with undisguised desperation lizzy
you gotta understand something
ive bet it all to find the heart of the ocean
ive got all my dough tied up in this thing
my wife even divorced me over this hunt
i need whats locked inside your grandmas memory
he holds out his hand you see this
she looks at his hand palm up
cupped as if around an imaginary shape
thats the shape my hands gonna be when i hold that thing
im not leaving here without it
look brock shes going to do this her way in her own time
dont forget she contacted you
shes out here for her own reasons god knows what they are
maybe she wants to make peace with the past
she has never once not once ever said a word about being on the titanic until two days ago
then were all meeting your grandmother for the first time
looks at him hard you think she was really there
yeah im a believer
she was there
bodine starts the tape recorder
rose is gazing at the screen seeing the live feed from the wreck snoop dog is moving along the starboard side of the hull heading aft
the rectangular windows of a deck forward march past on the right
the next day saturday i remember thinking how the sunlight felt
match dissolve from the rusting hulk to the gleaming new titanic in passing the end of the enclosed promenade just as rose walks into the sunlight right in front of
she is stunningly dressed and walking with purpose
as if i hadnt felt the sun in years
it is saturday april
rose unlatches the gate to go down into third class
the steerage men on the deck stop what theyre doing and stare at her
the social center of steerage life
it is stark by comparison to the opulence of first class but is a loud boisterous place
there are mothers with babies kids running between the benches yelling in several languages and being scolded in several more
there are old women yelling men playing chess girls doing needlepoint and reading dime novels
there is even an upright piano and tommy ryan is noodling around it
three boys shrieking and shouting are scrambling around chasing a rat under the benches trying to whomp it with a shoe and causing general havoc
jack is playing with year old cora cartmell drawing funny faces together in his sketchbook
fabrizio is struggling to get a conversation going with an attractive norwegian girl helga dahl sitting with her family at a table across the room
some little english
helgas eye is caught by something
fabrizio looks does a take
and jack curious follows their gaze to see
rose coming toward them
the activity in the room stops
a hush falls
rose feels suddenly self conscious as the steerage passengers stare openly at this princess some with resentment others with awe
she spots jack and gives a little smile walking straight to him
he rises to meet her smiling
fabrizio and tommy are floored
its like the slipper fitting cinderella
could i speak to you in private
he motions her ahead and follows
jack glances over his shoulder one eyebrow raised as he walks out with her leaving a stunned silence
jack and rose walk side by side
they pass people reading and talking in steamer chairs some of whom glance curiously at the mismatched couple
he feels out of place in his rough clothes
they are both awkward for different reasons
so you got a name by the way
rose dewitt bukater
thats quite a moniker
i may hafta get you to write that down
there is an awkward pause
dawson i jack
i feel like such an idiot
it took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you
well here you are
here i am
i want to thank you for what you did
not just for
for pulling me back
but for your discretion
look i know what you must be thinking
poor little rich girl
what does she know about misery
thats not what i was thinking
what i was thinking was
what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out
it wasnt just one thing
it was everything
it was them it was their whole world
and i was trapped in it like an insect in amber
in a rush i just had to get away
just run and run and run
and then i was at the back rail and there was no more ship
even the titanic wasnt big enough
not enough to get away from them
and before id really though about it i was over the rail
i was so furious
ill show them
theyll be sorry
theyll be sorry
course youll be dead
she lowers her head oh god i am such an utter fool
that penguin last night is he one of them
he is them
is he your boyfriend
worse im afraid
she shows him her engagement ring
a sizable diamond
gawd look at that thing
you would have gone straight to the bottom
they laugh together
a passing steward scowls at jack who is clearly not a first class passenger but rose just glares at him away
so you feel like youre stuck on a train you cant get off cause youre marryin this fella
so dont marry him
if only it were that simple
it is that simple
please dont judge me until youve seen my world
well i guess i will tonight
looking for another topic any other topic she indicates his sketchbook
just some sketches
the question is rhetorical because she has already grabbed the book
she sits on a deck chair and opens the sketchbook
on jacks sketches
each one an expressive little bit of humanity an old womans hands a sleeping man a father and daughter at the rail
the faces are luminous and alive
his book is a celebration of the human condition
jack these are quite good
really they are
well they didnt think too much of em in paree
some loose sketches fall out and are taken by the wind
jack scrambles after them
catching two but the rest are gone over the rail
oh im so sorry
well they didnt think too much of em in paree
he snaps his wrist shaking his drawing hand in a flourish
i just seem to spew em out
besides theyre not worth a damn anyway
for emphasis he throws away the two he caught
they sail off
laughing youre deranged
she goes back to the book turning a page
she has come upon a series of nudes
rose is transfixed by the languid beauty he has created
his nudes are soulful real with expressive hands and eyes
they feel more like portraits than studies of the human form
almost uncomfortably intimate
rose blushes raising the book as some strollers go by
trying to be very adult and these were drawn from life
thats one of the great things about paris
lots of girls willing take their clothes off
she studies one drawing in particular the girl posed half in sunlight half in shadow
her hands lie at her chin one furled and one open like a flower languid and graceful
the drawing is like an alfred steiglitz print of georgia okeefe
you liked this woman
you used her several times
she had beautiful hands
smiling i think you must have had a love affair with her
laughing no no
just with her hands
looking up from the drawings you have a gift jack
you see people
i see you
there it is
that piercing gaze again
you wouldnta jumped
ruth is having tea with noel lucy martha dyer edwardes the countess of rothes a ish english blue blood with patirician features
ruth sees someone coming across the room and lowers her voice
oh no that vulgar brown woman is coming this way
get up quickly before she sits with us
molly brown walks up greeting them cheerfully as they are rising
hello girls i was hoping id catch you at tea
were awfully sorry you missed it
the countess and i are just off to take the air on the boat deck
that sounds great
i need to catch up on the gossip
ruth grits her teeth as the three of them head for the grand staircase to go up
tracking with them as they cross the room the shot hands off to bruce ismay and captain smith at another table
so youve not lit the last four boilers then
no but were making excellent time
impatiently captain the press knows the size of titanic let them marvel at her speed too
we must give them something new to print
and the maiden voyage of titnaic must make headlines
i prefer not to push the engines until theyve been properly run in
of course i leave it to your good offices to decide whats best but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into new york tuesday night
and surprise them all
ismay slaps his hand on the table retire with a bang eh e
then smith nods stiffy
rose and jack stroll aft past people lounging on deck chairs in the slanting late afternoon light
stewards scurry to serve tea or hot cocoa
girlish and excited you know my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist
living in a garret poor but free
laughing you wouldnt last two days
theres no hot water and hardly ever any caviar
angry in a flash listen buster
i hate caviar
and im tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head
theres something in me jack
i feel it
i dont know what it is whether i should be an artist or i dont know
like isadora duncan
a wild pagan spirit
she leaps forward lands deftly and whirls like a dervish
then she sees something ahead and her face lights up
or a moving picture actress
she takes his hand and runs pulling him along the deck toward daniel and mary marvin
daniel is cranking the big wooden movie camera as she poses stiffly at the rail
sad sad sad
youve left your lover on the shore
you may never see him agian
try to be sadder darling
suddenly rose shoots into the shot and strikes a theatrical pose at the rail next to mary
mary bursts out laughing
rose pulls jack into the picture and makes him pose
marvin grins and starts yelling and gesturing
we see this in cuts with music and no dialogue
rose posing tragically at the rail the back of her hand to her forehead
jack on a deck chair pretending to be a pasha the two girls pantomiming fanning him like slave girls
jack on his knees pleading with his hands clasped while rose standing turns her head in bored disdain
rose cranking the camera while daniel and jack have a western shoot out
jack wins and leers into the lens twirling an air mustache like snidely whiplash
painted with orange light jack and rose lean on the a deck rail aft shoulder to shoulder
the ships lights come on
it is a magical moment
so then what mr
well then logging got to be too much like work so i went down to los angelas to the pier in santa monica
thats a swell place they even have a rollercoaster
i sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece
a whole ten cents
not getting it yeah it was great money
i could make a dollar a day sometimes
but only in summer
when it got cold i decided to go to paris and see what the real artists were doing
looks at the dusk sky why cant i be like you jack
just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it
turning to him say well go there sometime
to that pier
even if we only ever just talk about it
alright were going
well drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and well ride horses on the beach
right in the surf
but you have to ride like a cowboy none of that side saddle stuff
you mean one leg on each side
can you show me
if you like
smiling at him i think i would
she looks at the horizon and teach me to spit too
like a man
why should only men be able to spit
they didnt teach you that in finishing school
here its easy
it arcs out over the water
rose screws up her mouth and spits
a pathetic little bit of foamy spittle which mostly runs down her chin before falling off into the water
nope that was pitiful
here like this
you hawk it down
then roll it on your tongue up to the front like thith then a big breath and plooow
you see the range on that thing
she goes through the steps
hawks it down etc
he coaches her through it ad lib while doing the steps himself
she lets fly
so does he
two comets of gob fly out over the water
that was great
rose turns to him her face alight
suddenly she blanches
he sees her expression and turns
ruth the countess of rothes and molly brown have been watching them hawking lugees
rose becomes instantly composed
mother may i introduce jack dawson
charmed im sure
jack has a little spit running down his chin
he doesnt know it
molly brown is grinning
as rose proceeds with the introductions we hear
the others were gracious and curious about the man whod saved my life
but my mother looked at him like an insect
a dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly
well jack it sounds like youre a good man to have around in a sticky spot they all jump as a bugler sounds the meal call right behind them
why do they insist on always announcing dinner like a damn cavalry charge
shall we go dress mother
over her shoulder see you at dinner jack
as they walk away rose look at you
out in the sun with no hat
the countess exits with ruth and rose leaving jack and molly alone on deck
son do you have the slightest comprehension of what youre doing
well youre about to go into the snakepit
i hope youre ready
what are you planning to wear
jack looks down at his clothes
back up at her
he hadnt thought about that
mens suits and jackets and formal wear are strewn all over the place
molly is having a fine time
jack is dressed except for his jacket and molly is tying his bow tie
dont feel bad about it
my husband still cant tie one of these damn things after years
there you go
she picks up a jacket off the bed and hands it to him
jack goes into the bathroom to put it on
molly starts picking up the stuff off the bed
i gotta buy everything in three sizes cause i never know how much hes been eating while im away
she turns and sees him though we dont
my my my
you shine up like a new penny
boat deck first class entrance dusk a purple sky shot with orange in the west
drifting strains of classic music
we track with jack along the deck
by edwardian standards he looks badass
dashing in his borrowed white tie outfit right down to his pearl studs
a steward bows and smartly opens the door to the first class entrance
good evening sir
jack plays the role smoothly
nods with just the right degree of disdain
jack steps in and his breath is taken away by the splendor spread out before him
overhead is the enormous glass dome with a crystal chandelier at its center
sweeping down six stories is the first class grand staircase the epitome of the opulent naval architecture of the time
and the people the women in their floor length dresses elaborate hairstyles and abundant jewelry
the gentlemen in evening dress standing with one hand at the small of the back talking quietly
jack descends to a deck
several men nod a perfunctory greeting
he nods back keeping it simple
he feels like a spy
cal comes down the stairs with ruth on his arm covered in jewelry
they both walk right past jack neither one gecognizeing him
cal nods at him one gent to another
but jack barely has time to be amused
because just behind cal and ruth on the stairs is rose a vision in red and black her low cut dress showing off her neck and shoulders her arms seathed
in white gloves that come well above above the elbow
jack is hypnotized by her beauty
close on rose as she approaches jack
he imitates the gentlemens stance hand behind his back
she extends her gloved hand and he takes it kissing the back of her fingers
rose flushes beaming noticeably
she cant take her eyes off him
i saw that in a nickelodean once and i always wanted to do it
cal surely you remember mr
caught off guard dawson
i didnt recognize you
studies him amazing
you could almost pass for a gentlemen
cut to the reception room on d deck as the party descends to dinner
they encounter molly brown looking good in a beaded dress in her own busty broad shouldered way
molly grins when she sees jack
as they are going into the dining saloon she walks next to him speaking low aint nothin to it is there jack
yeah you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up
remember the only thing they respect is money so just act like youve got a lot of it and youre in the club
as they enter the swirling throng rose leans close to him pointing out several notables
theres the countess rothes
and thats john jacob astor
the richest man on the ship
his little wifey there madeleine is my age and in a delicate condition
see how shes trying to hide it
quite the scandal
nodding toward a couple and over there thats sir cosmo and lucile lady duff gordon
she designs naughty lingerie among her many talents
very popular with the royals
cal becomes engrossed in a conversations with cosmo duff gordon and colonel gracie while ruth the countess and lucille discuss fashion
rose picots jack smoothly to show him another couple dressed impeccably
and thats benjamin guggenheim and his mistress madame aubert
guggenheim is at home with the children of course
cal meanwhile is accepting the praise of his male counterparts who are looking at rose like a prize show horse
hockley she is splendid
cals a lucky man
i know him well and it can only be luck
ruth steps over hearing the last
she takes cals arm somewhat coquettishly
how can you say that colonel
caledon hockley is a great catch
the entourage strolls toward the dining saloon where they run into the astors going through the ornate double doors
madeleine id like you to meet jack dawson
shaking his hand good to meet you jack
are you of the boston dawsons
no the chippewa falls dawsons actually
nods as if hes heard of them then looks puzzled
madeleine astor appraises jack and whispers girlishly to rose its a pity were both spoken for isnt it
like a ballroom at the palace alive and lit by a constellation of chandeliers full of elegantly dressed people and beautiful music from bandleader wallace hartleys small orchestra
as rose and jack enter and move across the room to their table cal and ruth beside them we hear
he must have been nervous but he never faltered
they assumed he was one of them
a young captain of industry perhaps
new money obviously but still a memeber of the club
mother of course could always be counted upon
tell us of the accommodations in steerage mr
i hear theyre quite good on this ship
wider the table
jack is seated opposite rose who is flanked by cal and thomas andrews
also at the table are molly brown ismay colonel gracie the countess guggenheim madame aubert and the astors
the best ive seen mam
hardly any rats
rose motions surreptitiously for jack to take his napkin off his plate
dawson is joining us from third class
he was of some assistance to my fiancee last night
to jack as if to a child this is foie gras
its goose liver
we see whispers exchanged
jack becomesthe subject of furtive glances
now theyre all feeling terribly liberal and dangerous
low to madame aubert what is hockly hoping to prove bringing this
to jack how do you take your caviar sir
answering for him just a soupcon of lemon
to jack smiling it improves the flavor with champagne
to the waiter no caviar for me thanks
to cal never did like it much
he looks at rose pokerfaced and she smiles
and where exactly do you live mr
well right now my address is the rms titanic
after that im on gods good humor
salad is served
jack reaches for the fish fork
rose gives him a look and picks up the salad fork prompting him with her eyes
he changes forks
you find that sort of rootless existence appealing do you
its a big world and i want to see it all before i go
my father was always talkin about goin to see the ocean
he died in the town he was born in and never did see it
you cant wait around because you never know what hand youre going to get dealt next
see my folks died in a fire when i was fifteen and ive been on the road since
somethin like that teaches you to take life as it comes at you
to make each day count
molly brown raises her glass in a salute
well said jack
raising his glass here here
rose raises her glass looking at jack
to making it count
ruth annoyed that jack has scored a point presses him further
how is it you have the means to travel mr
i work my way from place to place
tramp steamers and such
i won my ticket on titanic here in a lucky hand at poker
he glances at rose a very lucky hand
all life is a game of luck
a real man makes his own luck archie
rose notices that thomas andrews sitting next to her is writing in his notebook completely ignoring the conversation
andrews what are you doing
i see you everywhere writing in this little book
grabs it and reads increase number of screws in hat hooks from to
you build the biggest ship in the world and this preoccupies you
andrews smiles sheepishly
he knows every rivet in her dont you thomas
all three million of them
his blood and soul are in the ship
she may be mine on paper but in the eyes of god she belongs to thomas andrews
your ship is a wonder mr
we see that andrews has come under roses spell
time transition dessert has been served and a waiter arrives with cigars in a humidor on a wheeled cart
the men start clipping ends and lighting
low to jack nest itll be brandies in the smoking room
rising well join me for a brandy gentlemen
low now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other on being masters of the universe
joining us dawson
you dont want to stay out here with the women do you
actually he does but
im heading back
itll be all business and politics that sort of thing
wouldnt interest you
good of you to come
cal and te other gentlemen exit
jack must you go
time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin
he leans over to take her hand
insert we see him slip a tiny folded not into her palm
ruth scowling watches him walk away across the enormous room
rose surreptitiously opens the note below table level
it reads make it count
meet me at the clock
rose crosses the a deck foyer sighting jack at the landing above
overhead is the crystal dome
jack has his back to her studying the ornate clock with its carved figures of honor and glory
it softly strikes the hour
moving with rose as she goes up the sweeping staircase toward him
he turns sees her
want to go to a real party
crow led and alive with music laughter and raucous carrying on
an ad hoc band is gathered near the upright piano honking out lively stomping music on fiddle accoridon and tambourine
people of all ages are dancing drinking beer and wine smoking laughing even brawling
tommy hands rose a pint of stout and she hoists it
jack meanwhile dances with year old cora cartmell or tries to with her standing on his feet
as the tune ends rose leans down to the little girl
may i cut in miss
youre still my best girl cora
cora scampers off
rose and jack face each other
she is trembling as he takes her right hand in his left
his other hand slides to the small of her back
it is an electrifying moment
i dont know the steps
just move with me
the music starts and they are off
a little awkward at first she starts to get into it
she grins at jack as she starts to get the rhythm of the steops
she bends down pulling off her high heeled shoes and flings them to tommy
then she grabs jack and they plunge back into the fray dancing faster as the music speeds up
the scene is rowdy and rollicking
a table gets knocked over as a drunk crashes into it
and in the middle of it
rose dancing with jack in her stocking feet
the steps are fast and she shines with sweat
a space opens around them and people watch them clapping as the band plays faster and faster
fabrizio and helga
dancing has obviated the need for a common language
he whirls her then she responds by whirling him
fabrizios eyes go wide when he realizes shes stronger than he is
the tune ends in a mad rush
jack steps away from rose with a flourish allowing her to take a bow
exhilarated and slightly tipsy she does a graceful ballet ployer feet turned out perfectly
everyone laughs and applauds
rose is a hit with the steerage folks whove never had a lady party with them
they move to a table flushed and sweaty
rose grabs fabrizios cigarette and takes a big drag
shes feeling cocky
fabrizio is grinning holding hands with helga
how you two doin
i dont know hwat shes say she dont know what i say so we get along fine
tommy walks up with a pint for each of them
rose chugs hers showing off
you think a first class girl cant drink
everybody else is dancing again and bjorn gundersen crashes into tommy who sloshes his beer over roses dress
she laughs not caring
but tommy lunges grabbing bjorn and wheeling him around
you stupid bastard
bjorn comes around his fists coming up
and jack leaps into the middle of it pushing them apart
did i ever tell you the one about the swede and the irishman goin to the whorehouse
tommy stands there all piss and vinegar chest puffed up
then he grins and claps bjorn on the shoulder
so you think youre big tough men
lets see you do this
in her stocking feet she assumes a ballet stance arms raised and goes up on point taking her entire weight on the tips of her toes
the guys gape at her incredible muscle control
she comes back down then her face screws up in pain
she grabs one foot hopping around
i havent done that in years
jack catches her as she loses her balance and everyone cracks up
the door to the well deck is open a few inches as lovejoy watches through the gap
he sees jack holding rose both of them laughing
lovejoy closes the door
the stars blaze overhead so bright and clear you can see the milky way
rose and jack walk along the row of lifeboats
still giddy from the party they are singing a popular song come josephine in my flying machine
come josephine in my flying machine and its up she goes
up she goes
in the air she goes
there she goes
they fumble the words and break down laughing
they have reached the first class entrance but dont go straight in not wanting the evening to end
through the doors the sound of the ships orchestra wafts gently
rose grabs a davit and leans back staring at the cosmos
isnt it magnificent
so grand and endless
she goes to the rail and leans on it
theyre such small people jack
they think theyre giants on the earth but theyre not even dust in gods eye
they live inside this little tiny champagne bubble
and someday the bubbles going to burst
he leans at the rail next to her his hand just touching hers
it is the slightest contact imaginable and all either one of them can feel is that square inch of skin where their hands are touching
youre not one of them
theres been a mistake
you got mailed to the wrong address
laughing i did didnt i
pointing suddenly look
a shooting star
that was a long one
my father used to say that whenever you saw one it was a soul going to heaven
i like that
arent we supposed to wish on it
jack looks at her and finds that they are suddenly very close together
it would be so easy to move another couple of inches to kiss her
rose seems to be thinking the same thing
what would you wish for
after a beat rose pulls back
something i cant have
she smiles sadly goodnight jack
and thank you
she leaves the rail and hurries through the first class entrance
but the door bangs shut and she is gone
back to her world
a bright clear day
sunlight splashing across the promenade
rose and cal are having breakfast in silence
the tension is palpable
trudy bolt in her maids uniform pours the coffee and goes inside
i had hoped you would come to me last night
i was tired
your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting
stiffening i see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me
you will never behave like that again
do you understand
im not some foreman in your mills than you can command
i am your fiancee cal explodes sweeping the breakfast china off the table with a crash
he moves to her in one shocking moment glowering over her and gripping the sides of her chair so she is trapped between his arms
and my wife
in practice if not yet by law
so you will honor me as a wife is required to honor her husband
i will not be made out a fool
is this in any way unclear
rose shrinks into the chair
she sees trudy frozen partway through the door bringing the orange juice
cal follows roses glance and straightens up
he stalks past the maid entering the stateroom
had a little accident
im sorry trudy
rose is dressed for the day and is in the middle of helping ruth with her corset
the tight bindings do not inhibit ruths fury at all
you are not to see that boy again do you understand me rose
i forbid it
rose has her knee at the base of her mothers back and is pulling the corset strings with both hands
oh stop it mother
youll give yourself a nosebleed
ruth pulls away from her and crosses to the door locking it
wheeling on her rose this is not a game
our situation is precarious
you know the moneys gone
of course i know its gone
you remind me every day
your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name
and that name is the only card we have to play
rose turns her around and grabs the corset strings again
ruth sucks in her waist and rose pulls
i dont understand you
it is a fine match with hockley and it will insure our survival
hurt and lost how can you put this on my shoulders
rose turns to her and we see what rose sees the naked fear in her mothers eyes
do you want to se me working as a seamstress
is that what you want
do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction our memories scattered to the winds
my god rose how can you be so selfish
its so unfair
of course its unfair
our choices are never easy
rose pulls the corset tighter
at the divine service captain smith is leading a group in the hymn almighty father strong to save
rose and ruth sing in the middle of the group
lovejoy stands well back keeping an eye on rose
he notices a commotion at the entry doors
jack has been halted there by two stewards
he is dressed in his third class clothes and stands there hat in hand looking out of place
look you youre not supposed to be in here
i was just here last night
dont you remember
seeing lovejoy coming toward him hell tell you
hockley and mrs
dewitt bukater continue to be most appreciative of your assistance
they asked me to give you this in gratitude he holds out two twenty dollar bills which jack refuses to take
i dont want money i and also to remind you that you hold a third class ticket and your presence here is no longer appropriate
jack spots rose but she doesnt see him
i just need to talk to rose for a gentlemen please see that mr
dawson gets back where he belongs
giving the twenties to the stewards and that he stays there
to jack come along you
end on rose not seeing jack hustled out
singing o hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea
an edwardian nautilus room
there are machines we recognize and some dont
a woman pedals a stationary bicycle in a long dress looking rediculous
thomas andrews is leading a small tour group including rose ruth and cal
cal is wroking the oars of a stationary rowing machine with a well trained stroke
reminds me of my harvard days
mccauley the gym instructor is a bouncy little man in white flannels eager to show off his modern equipment like his present day counterpart on an abflex infomercial
he hits a switch and a machine with a saddle on it starts to undulate
rose puts her hand on it curious
the electric horse is very popular
we even have an electric camel
to ruth care to try your hand at the rowing mam
dont be absurd
i cant think of a skill i should likely need less
the next stop on our tour will be bridge
this way please
jack walking with determination is followed closely by tommy and fabrizio
he quickly climbs the steps to b deck and steps over the gate separating rd from nd class
shes a goddess amongst mortal men theres no denyin
but shes in another world jackie forget her
shes closed the door
jack moves furtively to the wall below the a deck promenade aft
it was them not her
glancing around the deck ready
tommy shakes his head resignedly and puts his hands together crouching down
jack steps into tommys hands and gets boosted up to the next deck where he scrambles nimbly over the railing onto the first class deck
hes not bein logical i tell ya
amore isa not logical
a man is playing with his son who is spinning a top with a string
the mans overcoat and hat are sitting on a deck chair nearby
jack emerges from behind one of the huge deck cranes and calmly picks up the coat and bowler hat
he walks away slipping into the coat and slicks his hair back with spit
then puts the hat on at a jaunty angle
at a distance he could pass for a gentlemen
harold bride the year old junior wireless operator hustles in and skirts around andrews tour group to hand a marconigram to captain smith
another ice warning sir
this one from the baltic
smith glances at the message then nonchalantly puts it in his pocket
he nods reassuringly to rose and the group
not to worry its quite normal for this time of year
in fact were speeding up
ive just ordered the last boilers lit
andrews scowls slightly before motioning the group toward the door
they exit just as second officer charles herbert lightoller comes out of the chartroom stopping next to first officer murdoch
did we ever find those binoculars for the lookouts
havent seen them since southampton
andrews leads the group back from the bridge along the boat deck
andrews i did the sum in my head and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned
forgive me but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard
about half actually
rose you miss nothing do you
in fact i put in these new type davits which can take an extra row of boats here
he gestures along the eck but it was thought
that the deck would look too cluttered
so i was over ruled
slapping the side of a boat waste of deck space as it is on an unsinkable ship
sleep soundly young rose
i have built you a good ship strong and true
shes all the lifeboat you need
as they are passing boat a gentlemen turns from the rail and walks up behind the group
it is jack
he taps rose on the arm and she turns gasping
he motions and she cuts away from the group toward a door which jack holds open
they duck into the jack closes the door behind her and glances out through the ripple glass window to the starboard rail where the gym instructor is chatting up the
woman who was riding the bike
rose and jack are alone in the room
jack this is impossible
i cant see you
he takes her by the shoulders
rose youre no picnic
youre a spoiled little brat even but under that youre a strong pure heart and youre the most amazingly astounding girl ive ever known and jack i no wait
let me try to get this out
and i know i have nothing to offer you rose
i know that
but im involved now
you jump i jump remember
i cant turn away without knowin that youre goin to be alright
rose feels the tears coming to her eyes
jack is so open and real
not like anyone she has ever known
youre making this very hard
ill be fine
i dont think so
theyve got you in a glass jar like some butterfly and youre goin to die if you dont break out
maybe not right away cause youre strong
but sooner or later the fire in you is goin to go out
its not up to you to save me jack
only you can do that
i have to get back theyll miss me
please jack for both our sakes leave me alone
the most elegant room on the ship done in louis quinze versaille style
rose sits on a divan with a group of other women arrayed around her
ruth the countess rothes and lady duff gordon are taking tea
rose is silent and still as a porcelain figurine as the conversation washes around her
of course the invitations had to be sent back to the printers twice
and the bridesmaids dresses
let me tell you what an odyssey that has been
tracking slowly in on rose as ruth goes on
reverse roses pov a tabeau of mother and daughter having tea
the four year old girl wearing white gloves daintily picking up a cookie
the mother correcting her on her posture and the way she holds the teacup
the little girl is trying so hard to please her expression serious
a glimpse of rose at that age and we see the relentless conditioning
the pain to becoming an edwardian geisha
she calmly and deliberately turns her teacup over spilling tea all over her dress
oh look what ive done
titanic steams toward us in the dusk light as if lit by the embers of a giant fire
as the ship looms filling frame we push in on the bow
jack is there right at the apex of the bow railing his favorite spot
he closes his eyes letting the chill wind clear his head
jack hears her voice behind him
he turns and she is standing there
i changed my mind
he smiles at her his eyes drinking her in
her cheeks are red with the chill wind and her eyes sparkle
her hair blows wildly about her face
fabrizio said you might be up sssshh
he puts his hands on her waist
as if he is going to kiss her
close your eyes
she does and he turns her to face forward the way the ship is going
he presses her gently to the rail standing right behind her
then he takes her two hands and raises them until she is standing with her arms outstetched on each side
rose is going along with him
when he lowers his hands her arms stay up
there is nothing in her field of vision but water
its like there is no ship under them at all just the two of them soaring
the atlantic unrolls toward her a hammered copper shield under a dusk sky
there is only the wind and the hiss of the water feel below
she leans forward arching her back
he puts his hands on her waist to steady her
singing softly come josephine in my flying machine
rose cleses her eyes feeling herself floating weightless far above the sea
she smiles dreamily then leans back gently pressing her back against his chest
he pushes forward slightly against her
slowly he raises his hands arms outstretched and they meet hers
fingertips gently touching
then their fingers intertwine
moving slowly their fingers caress through and around each other like the bodies of two lovers
jack tips his face forward into her blowing hair letting the scent of her wash over him until his cheek is agianst her ear
rose turns her head until her lips are near his
she lowers her arms turning further until she finds his mouth with hers
he wraps his arms around her from behind and they kiss like this with her head turned and tilted back surrendering to him to the emotion to the inevitable
they kiss slowly and tremulously and then with building passion
jack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and optimism lifting her buoying her forward on a magical journey soaring onward into a night without fear
in the crows nest high above and behind them lookout frederick fleet nudges his mate reginald lee pointing down at the figures in the bow
wish i had those bleedin binoculars
jack and rose embracing at the bow rail dissolve slowly away leaving the ruined bow of the wreck old rose blinks seeming to come back to the present
she sees the wreck on the screen the sad ghost ship deep in the abyss
that was the last time titanic ever saw daylight
brock lovett changes the tape in the minicassette recorder
so were up to dusk on the night of the sinking
six hours to go
dont you love it
theres smith hes standing there with the iceberg warning in his fucking hand
remembering rose excuse me
in his hand and hes ordering more speed
years of experience working against him
he figures anything big enough to sink the ship theyre going to see in time to turn
but the ships too big with too small a rudder
it cant corner worth shit
everything he knows is wrong
rose is ignoring this conversation
she has the art nouveau comb with the jade butterfly on the handle in her hands turning it slowly
she is watching a monitor which shows the ruins of suite b
push in until the image fills frame
like in a dream the beautiful woodwork and satin upholstery emerge from the rusted ruin
jack is overwhelmed by the opulence of the room
he sets his sketchbood and drawing materials on the marble table
will this light do
dont artists need good light
bad french accent zat is true i am not used to working in such orreeble conditions
seeing the paintings hey
he crouches next to the paintings stacked against the wall
isnt he great
the use of color
i saw him once
through a hole in this garden fence in giverny
she goes into the adjoining walk in wardrobe closet
he sees her go to the safe and start working the combination
cal insist on luggin this thing everywhere
should i be expecting him anytime soon
not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out
she unlocks the safe
glancing up she meets his eyes in the mirror behind the safe
she opens it and removes the necklace then holds it out to jack who takes it nervously
what is it
a very rare diamond called the heart of the ocean
jack gazes at wealth beyond his comprehension
i want you to draw me like your french girl
she smiles at him wearing only this
he looks up at her surprised and we cut to roses bedroom
on the butterfly comb as rose draws it out of her hair
she shakes her head and her hair falls free around her shoulders
in the sitting room jack is laying out his pencils like surgical tools
his sketchbook is open and ready
he looks up as she comes into the room wearing a silk kimono
the last thing i need is another picture of me looking like a china doll
as a paying customer i expect to get what i want
she hands him a dime and steps back parting the kimono
the blue stone lies on her creamy breast
her heart is pounding as she slowly lowers the robe
jakc looks so stricken it is almost comical
the kimono drops to the floor this is all in cuts lyrical
tell me when it looks right to you
she poses on the divan settling like a cat into the position we remember from the drawing
just bend your left leg a little and
and lower your head
eyes to me
jack starts to sketch
he drops his pencil and she stifles a laugh
i believe you are blushing mr
i cant imagine monsieur monet blushing
sweating he does landscapes
tight on jack as his eyes come up to look at her over the top edge of his sketchpad
we have seen this image of him before in her memory
it is an image she will carry the rest of her life
despite his nervousness he draws with sure strokes and what emerges is the best thing he has ever done
her pose is languid her hands beautiful and her eyes radiate her energy
match dissolve morph to rose years old
only her eyes are the same
my heart was pounding the whole time
it was the most erotic moment of my life
up till then at least
cut to reverse a semicircle of listeners staring in rapt frozen silence
the story of jack and rose has finally and completely grabbed them
smiling you mean did we do it
jack is signing the drawing
rose wearing her kimono again is leaning on his shoulder watching
sorry to disappoint you mr
rose gazes at the drawing
he has x rayed her soul
date it jack
i want to always remember this night
rose meanwhile scribbles a note on a piece of titanic stationary
we dont see what it says
she accepts the drawing from him and crosses to the safe in the wardrobe
she puts the diamond back in the safe placing hte drawing and the note on top of it
closes the door with a clunk
lovejoy enters from the palm court through the revolving door and crosses the room toward hockley
a fire is blazing in the marble fireplace and the usual fatcats are playing cards drinking and talking
cal sees lovejoy and detaches from his group coming to him
none of the stewards have seen her
low but forceful this is ridiculous lovejoy
titanic glides across an unnatural sea blakc and calm as a pool of oil
the ships lights are mirrored almost perfectly in the black water
the sky is brilliant with stars
a meteor traces a bright line across the heavens
on the bridge captain smith peers out at the blackness ahead of the ship
quartermaster hitchins brings him a cup of hot tea with lemon
it steams in the bitter cold of the open bridge
second officer lightoller is next to him staring out at the sheet of black glass the atlantic has become
i dont think ive ever seen such a flat calm in years at sea
yes like a mill pond
not a breath of wind
its make the bergs harder to see with no breaking water at the base
well im off
maintain speed and heading mr
and wake me of course if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful
rose fully dressed now returns to the sitting room
they hear a key in the lock
rose takes jacks hand and leads him silently through the bedrooms
lovejoy enters by the sitting room door
he hears a door opening and goes through cals room toward hers
rose and jack come out of her stateroom closing the door
she leads him quickly along the corridor toward the b deck foyer
they are halfway across the open space when the sitting room door opens in the corridor and lovejoy comes out
the valet sees jack with rose and hustles after them
she and jack break into a run surprising the few ladies and gentlemen about
rose leads him past the stairs to the bank of elevators
they run into one shocking the hell out of the operator
take us down
the operator scrambles to comply
jack even helps him close the steel gate
lovejoy runs up as the lift starts to descend
he slams one hand on the bars of the gate
rose makes a very rude and unladylike gesture and laughs as lovejoy disappears above
the operator gapes at her
lovejoy emerges from another lift and runs to the one jack and rose were in
the operator is just closing the gate to go back up
lovejoy runs around the bank of elevators and scans the foyer
no jack and rose
he tries the stairs going down to f deck
a functional space with access to a number of machine spaces fan rooms boiler uptakes
jack and rose are leaning against a wall laughing
pretty tough for a valet this fella
hes an ex pinkerton
cals father hired him to keep cal out of trouble
to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town
kinda like were doin right now uh oh
lovejoy has spotted them from a cross corridor nearby
he charges toward them
jack and rose run around a corner into a blind alley
there is one door marked crew only and jack flings it open
they enter a roaring ran room with no way out but a ladder going down
jack latches the deadbolt on the door and lovejoy slams against it a moment later
jack grins at rose pointing to the ladder
after you mlady
jack and rose come down the escape ladder and look around in amazement
it is like a vision of hell itself with the roaring furnaces and black figures moving in the smoky glow
they run the length of the boiler room dodging amazed stokers and trimmers with their wheelbarrows of coal
shouting over the din carry on
dont mind us
they run through the open watertight door into boiler room six
jack pulls her through the fiercely hot alley between two boilers and they wind up in the dark out of sight of the working crew
watching from the shadows they see the stokers working in the hellish glow shovelling coal into the insatiable maws of the furnaces
the whole place thunders with the roar of the fires
amid unparalled luxury cal sits at a card game sipping brandy
were going like hell i tel you
i have fifty dollars that says we make it into new york tuesday night
cal looks at his gold pocket watch and scowls not listening
the furnaces roar silhouetting the glistening stokers
jack kisses roses face tasting the sweat trickling down from her forehead
they kiss passionately in the steamy pounding darkness
jack and rose enter and run laughing between the rows of stacked cargo
she hugs herself against the cold after the dripping heat of the boiler room
they come upon william carters brand new renault touring car lashing down to a pallet
it looks like a royal coach from a fairy tale its brass trim and headlamps nicely set off by its deep burgundy color
rose climbs into the plushly upholstered back seat acting very royal
there are cut crystals bud vases on the walls back there each containing a rose
jack jumps into the drivers seat enjoying hte feel of the leather and wood
where to miss
to the stars
on jack as her hands come out of the shadows and pull him over the seat into the back
he lands next to her and his breath seems loud in the quiet darkness
he looks at her and she is smiling
it is the moment of truth
are you nervous
au contraire mon cher
he strokes her face cherishing her
she kisses his artists fingers
put your hands on me jack
he kisses her and she slides down in the seat under his welcome weight
a brilliant arc of electricity fills frame the sparks gap of the marconi instrument as senior wireless operator jack phillips rapidly keys out a message
junior operator bride looks through the huge stack of outgoing messages swamping them
look at this one he wants his private train to meet him
la dee da
slaps them down well be up all bloody night on this lot
phillips start to receive an incoming message from a nearby ship the leyland frieghter californian which jams his outgoing signal
at such close range the beeps are deafening
its that idiot on the californian
cursing phillips furiously keys a rebuke
wireless operater cyril evans pulls his earphone off his ear as the titanics spark deafens him
he translates the message for third officer stupid bastard
i try to warn him about the ice and he says keep out
im working cape race
now whats he sending
poker business good
well thats it for me
im shutting down
as evans wearily switches off his generator groves goes out on deck
pan off him to reveal the ship is stopped fifty yards from the edge of a field of pack ice and icebergs stretching as far as the eye can see
on titanic steaming hellbent through the darkness hurling up white water at the bows
the bow comes straight at us until the bow wave wipes the pushing in on the rear window of the renault which is completely fogged up
roses hand comes up and slams against the glass for a moment making a handprint in the veil of condensation
inside the car jacks overcoat is liek a blanket over them
it stirs and rose pulls it down
they are huddled under it intertwined still mostly clothed
their faces are flushed and they look at each other wonderingly
she puts her hand on his face as if making sure he is real
he lays his cheek against her chest
i can feel your heart beating
she hugs his head to her chest and just holds on for dear life
well i wasnt the first teenage girl to get seduced in the backseat of a car and certainly not the last by several million
he had such fine hands artists hands but strong too
roughened by work
i remember their touch even now
the bow sweeps under us and the camera climbs toward the foremast and the tiny half cylinder of the crows nest which grows as we push in on lookouts fleet
they are stamping their feet and swinging their arms trying to keep warm in the knot freezing wind which whips capor of their breath away behind
you can smell ice you know when its near
well i can
without hearing hte words over the roar of the furnaces we see stokers telling two stewards which way rose and jack went
the stewards move off toward the forward holds
cal stands at the open safe
he stares at the drawing of rose and his face clenches with fury
he reads the not again darling now you can keep us lovejoy standing behind him looks over his shoulder at the drawing
cal crumples roses not then takes the drawing in both hands as if to rip it in half
he tenses to do it then stops himself
i have a better idea
the two stewards enter
they have electric torches and play the beams around the hold
they spot the renault with its fogged up rear window and approach it slowly
from inside we see the torch light up roses passionate handprint still there on the fogged up glass
one steward whips open the door
reverse the back seat is empty
rose and jack fully dressed come through a crew door onto the deck
they can barely stand they are laughing so hard
up above them in the crows nest lookout fleet hears the disturbance below and looks around and back down to the well deck where he can see two figures embracing
jack and rose stand in each others arms
their breath clouds around them in the now freezing air but they dont even feel the cold
when this ship docks im getting off with you
this is crazy
it doesnt make any sense
thats why i trust it
jack pulls her to him and kisses her fiercely
in the crows nest fleet nudges lee
look at that would ya
theyre a bloody sight warmer than we are
well if thats what it takes for us two to get warm id rather not if its all the same
they both have a good laugh at that one
it is fleet whose expression falls first
glancing forward again he does a double take
the color drains out of his face
fleets pov a massive iceberg right in their path yards out
fleet reaches past lee and rings the lookout bell three times then grabs the telephone calling the bridge
he waits precious seconds for it to be picket up never taking his eyes off the black mass ahead
pick up ya bastard
inside the enclosed wheelhous sixth officer moody walks unhurriedly to the telephone picking it up
is someone there
what do you see
iceberg right ahead
hangs up calls to murdoch iceberg right ahead
murdoch sees it and rushes to the engine room telegraph
while signaling full speed astern he yells to quartermaster hitchins who is at the wheel
hard a starboard
standing behind hitchins harda starboard
the helm is hard over sir
chief engineer bell is just checking the soup he has warming on a steam manifold when the engine telegraph clangs then goes
to full speed astern
he and the other engineers just stare at it a second unbelieving
then bell reacts
the engineers and greasers like madmen to close steam valves and start braking the mighty propeller shafts big as sequias to a stop
in boiler room six leading stoker frederick barrett is standing with nd engineer james hesketh when the red warning light and stop indicator come on
shut all dampers
from the bridge murdoch watches the burg growing
the bow finally starts to come left since the ship turns the reverse of the helm setting
murdochs jaw clenches as the bow turns with agonizing slowness
he holds his breath as the horrible physics play out
in the crows nest frederick fleet braces himself
the bow of the ship thunders right at camera and kruuunch
the ship hits the berg on its starboard bow
underwater we see the ice smashing in the steel hull plates
the iceberg bumps and scrapes along the side of the ship
rivets pop as the steel plate of the hull flexes under the load
in hold the two stewards stagger as the hull buckles in four feet with a sound like thunder
like a sledgehammer beating along outside the ship the berg splits the hull plates and the sea pour in sweeping them off their feert
the icy water swirls around the renault as the men scramble for the stairs
on g deck forward fabrizio is tossed in his bunk by the impact
he hears a sound like the greatly amplified squeal of a skate on ice
in boiler room six barret and hesketh stagger as they hear the rolling thunder of the collision
they see the starboard side of the ship buckle in toward them and are almost swept off their feet by a rush of water coming in about two feet above
on the forward well deck jack and rose break their kiss and look up in astonishment as the berg sails past blocking out the sky like a mountain
fragments break off it and crash down onto the deck and they have to jump back to avoid flying chunks of ice
on the bridge murdoch rings the watertight door alarm
he quicky throws the switch that closes them
hard a port
judging the berg to be amidships he is trying to clear the stern
barrett and hesketh hear the door alarm and scramble through the swirling water to the watertight door between boiler rooms and
the room is full of water vapor as the cold sea strikes the red hot furnaces
barrett yells to the stokers scrambling through the door as it comes down like a slow guillotine
he dives through into boiler room just before the door rumbles down with a clang
jack and rose rush to the starboard rail in time to see the berg moving aft down the side of the ship
in his stateroom surrounded by piles of plans while making notes in his ever present book andrews looks up at the sound of a cut crystal light fixture tinkling like
he feels the shudder run through the ship
and we see it in his face
too much of his soul is in this great ship for him not to feel its mortal wound
in the first class smoking room gracie watches his highball vibrating on the table
in the palm court with its high arched windows molly brown holds up her drink to a passing waiter
hey can i get some ice here please
silently a moving wall of ice fills the window behind her
she doesnt see it
it disappears astern
in the crows nest fleet turns to his lee
that was a close shave
smell ice can you
close on murdoch
the alarm bells still clatter mindlessly seeming to reflect his inner state
he is in shock unable to get a grip on what just happened
he just ran the biggest ship in history into an iceberg on its maiden voyage
stiffly to moody note the time
enter it in the log
captain smith rushes out of his cabin onto the bridge tucking in his shirt
what was that mr
an iceberg sir
i put her hard a starboard and run the engines full astern but it was too close
i tried to port around it but she hi
and close the emergency doors
the doors are closed
together they rush out onto the starboard wing and murdoch points
smith looks into the darkness aft then wheels around to fourth officer bohall
find the carpenter and get him to sound the ship
in steerage fabrizio comes out into the hall to see whats going on
he sees dozens of rats running toward him in the corridor fleeing the flooding bow
fabrizio jumps aside as the rats run by
ma che cazzo
in his stateroom tommy gets out of his top bunk in the dark and drops down to the floor
what in hell
he naps on the light
the floor is covered with inches of freezing water and more coming in
he pulls the door open and steps out into the corridor which is flooded
fabrizio is running toward him yelling something in italian
tommy and fabrizio start pounding on doors getting everybody up and out
the alarm spreads in several languages
a couple of people have come out into the corridor in robes and slippers
a steward hurries along reassuring them
why have the engines stopped
i felt a shudder
i shouldnt worry mam
weve likely thrown a propeller blade thats the shudder you felt
may i bring you anything
thomas andrews brushes past them walking fast and carrying an armload of rolled up ships plans
jack and rose are leaning over the starboard rail looking at the hull of the ship
i dont see anything
could it have damaged the ship
it didnt seem like much of a bump
im sure were okay
behind them a couple of steerage guys are kicking the ice around the deck laughing
fabrizio and tommy are in a crowd of steerage men clogging the corridors heading aft away from the flooding
many of them have grabbed suitcases and duffel bags some of which are soaked
if this is the direction the rats were runnin its good enough for me
bruce ismay dressed in pajamas under the topcoat hurries down the corridor headed for the bridge
an officious steward named barnes comes along the other direction getting the few concerned passengers back into their rooms
theres no cause for alarm
please go back to your rooms
he is stopped in his tracks by cal and lovejoy
theres no emergency yes there is i have been robbed
now get the master at arms
now you moron
captain smith studying the commutator
he turns to andrews standing behind him
a five degree list in less than ten minutes
ships carpenter john hutchinson enters behind him out of breath and clearly unnerved
shes making water fast
in the forepeak tank and the forward holds in boiler room six
ismay enters his movements quick with anger and frustration
smith glances at him with annoyance
why have we stopped
weve struck ice
well do you think the ship is seriously damaged
glaring excuse me
smith pushes past him with andrews and hutchinson in tow
strokers and firemen are struggling to draw the fires
they are working in waist deep water churning around as it flows into the boiler room ice cold and swirling with grease from the machinery
chief engineer bell comes partway down the ladder and shouts
thats it lads
get the hell up
they scramble up the escape ladders
the gentlemen now joined by another man leans on the forward rail watching the steerage men playing soccer with chunks of ice
i guess its nothing too serious
im going back to my cabin to read
a ish yale man pops through the door wearing a topcoat over pajamas
say did i miss the fun
rose and jack come up the steps from the well deck which are right next to the three men
they stare as the couple climbs over the locked gate
a moment later captain smith rounds the corner followed by andrews and carpenter hutchinson
they have come down from the bridge by the outside stairs
the three men their faces grim crush right past jack and rose
andrews barely glances at her
can you shore up
not unless the pumps get ahead
the inspection party goes down the stairs to the well deck
low to her its bad
we have to tell mother and cal
now its worse
come with me jack
i jump you jump
jack follows rose through the door inside the ship
jack and rose cross the foyer entering the corridor
lovejoy is waiting for them in the hall as they approach the room
weve been looking for you miss
lovejoy follows and unseen moves close behind jack and smoothly slips the diamond necklace into the pocket of his overcoat
cal and ruth wait in the sitting room along with the master at arms and two stewards steward and barnes
silence as rose and jack enter
ruth closes her robe at her throat when she sees jack
something serious has happened
two things dear to me have disappeared this evening
now that one is back
he looks from rose to jack i have a pretty good idea where to fine the other
to master at arms search him
the master at arms steps up to jack
coat off mate
lovejoy pulls at jacks coat and jack shakes his head in dismay shrugging out of it
the master at arms pats him down
this is horseshit
cal you cant be serious
were in the middle of an emergency and you steward barnes pulls the heart of the ocean out of the pocket of jacks coat
is this it
rose is stunned
needless to say so is jack
now dont make a fuss
he starts to handcuff jack
dont you believe it rose
uncertain he couldnt have
of course he could
easy enough for a professional
he memorized the combination when you opend the safe
flashback rose at the safe looking in the mirror and meeting jacks eyes as he stands behind her watching
but i was with him the whole time
just to her low and cold maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on
they put it in my pocket
holding jacks coat its not even your pocket son
reading property of a
lovejoy shows the coat to the master at arms
there is a label inside the collar with the owners name
that was reported stolen today
i was going to return it
rose rose feels utterly betrayed hurt and confused
she shrinks away from him
he starts shouting to her as lovejoy and the master at arms drag him out into the hall
she cant look him in the eye
rose dont listen to them
i didnt do this
you know i didnt
you know it
she is devastated
her mother lays a comforting hand on her shoulder as te tears well up
why do women believe men
smith and andrews come down the steps to the mail sorting room and finds the clerks scrambling to pull mail from the racks
they are furiously hauling wet sacks of mail up from the hold below
andrews climbs partway down the stairs to the hold which is almost full
sacks of mail float everywhere
the lights are still on below the surface casting an eerie glow
the renault is visible under the water the brass glinting cheerfully
andrews looks down as the water covers his shoe and scrambles back up the stairs
andrews unrolls a big drawing of the ship across the chartroom table
it is a side elevation showing all the watertight bulkheads
his hands are shaking
murdoch and ismay hover behind andrews and the captain
when can we get underway do you think
smith glares at him and turns his attention to andrews drawing
the builder points to it for emphasis as he talks
water feet above the keel in ten minutes
in the forepeak
in all three holds
and in boiler room six
she can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached
but not five
as she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads
at e deck
from one to the next
back and back
theres no stopping it
the pumps the pumps buy you time
but minutes only
from this moment no matter what we do titanic will founder
but this ship cant sink
she is made of iron sir
i assure you she can
and she will
it is a mathematical certainty
smith looks like he has been gutpunched
how much time
an hour two at most
ismay reels as his dream turns into his worst nightmare
and how many aboard mr
two thousand two hundred souls aboard sir
a long beat
smith turns to his employer
i believe you may get your headlines mr
andrews is striding along the boat deck as seamen and officers scurry to uncover the boats
steam is venting from pipes on the funnes overhead and the din is horrendous
speech is difficult adding to the crews level of disorganization
andrews sees some men fumbling with the mechanism of one of the wellin davits and yells to them over the roar of steam
turn to the right
pull the falls taut before you unchock
have you never had a boat drill
not with these new davits sir
he looks around disguisted as the crew fumble with the davits and the tackle for the falls
the ropes which are used to lower the boats
a few passengers are coming out on deck hesitantly in the noise and bitter cold
from inside the sitting room they can hear knocking and voices in the corridor
i had better go dress
ruth exits and hockley crosses to rose
he regards her coldly for a moment then slaps her across the face
it is a little slut isnt it
to rose the blow is inconsequential compared to the blow her heart has been given
cal grabs her shoulders roughly
look at me you little there is a loud knock on the door and an urgent voice
the door opens and their steward puts his head in
sir ive been told to ask you to please put on your lifebelt and come up to the boat deck
the steward persists coming in to get the lifebelts down from the top of a dresser
im sorry about the inconvenience mr
hockley but its captains orders
please dress warmly its quite cold tonight
he hands a lifebelt to rose not to worry miss im sure its just a precaution
this is ridiculous
in the corridor outside the stewards are being so polite and obsequious they are conveying no sense of danger whatsoever
however its another story in
the door is thrown open and the lights snapped on by a steward
the cartmell family rouses from a sound sleep
put your lifebelts on
in the corridor outside another steward is going from door to door along the hall pouncing and yelling
everybody up come on
people come out of the doors behind the steward perplexed
in the foreground a syrian woman asks her husband what was said
on phillips looking shocked
the distress call
tell whoever responds that we are going down by the head and need immediate assistance
smith hurries out
maybe you ought to try that new distress call
grinning it may be our only chance to use it
phillips laughs in spite of himself and starts sending historys first s
dit dit dit da da da dit dit dit
over and over
thomas andrews looks around in amazement
the deck is empty except for the crew fumbling with the davits
he yells over the roar of the steam to first officer murdoch
where are all the passengers
theyve all gone back inside
too damn cold and noisy for them
andrews feels like he is in a bad dream
he looks at his pocketwatch and heads for the foyer entrance
a large number of first class passengers have gathered near the staircase
they are getting indignant about the confusion
molly brown snags a passing whats doing sonny
youve got us all trussed up and now were cooling our heels
the young steward backs away actually stumbling on the stairs
let me go and find out
the jumpy piano rhythm of alexanders ragtime band comes out of the first class lounge a few yards away
band leader wallace hartley has assembled some of his men on captains orders to allay panic
hockleys entourage comes up to the a deck foyer
cal is carrying the lifebelts almost as an afterthought
rose is like a sleepwalker
its just the god damned english doing everything by the book
theres no need for language mr
to trudy go back and turn the heater on in my room so it wont be too cold when we get back
thomas andrews enters looking around the magnificent room which he knows is doomed
rose standing nearby sees his heartbroken expression
she walks over to him and cal goes after her
i saw the iceberg mr
and i see it in your eyes
please tell me the truth
the ship will sink
in an hour or so
will be at the bottom of the atlantic
now it is cals turn to look stunned
please tell only who you must i dont want to be responsible for a panic
and get to a boat quickly
you remember what i told you about the boats
yes i understand
andrews goes off moving among the passengers and urging them to put on their lifebelts and get to the boats
lovejoy and the master at arms are handcuffing jack to a water pipe as a crewman rushes in anxiously and almost blurts to the master at arms youre wanted by
the purser sir
ill keep an eye on him
lovejoy pulls a pearl handled colt
automatic from under his coat
the master at arms nods and tosses the handcuff key to lovejoy then exits with the crewman
lovejoy flips the key in the air
junior wireless operator bride is relaying a message to captain smith from the cunard liner carpathia
carpathia says theyre making knots full steam for them sir
and shes the only one whos responding
the only one close sir
she says they can be here in four hours
the enormity of it hits smith like a sledgehammer blow
thank you bride
he turns as bride exits and looks out onto the blackness
to himself my god
lightoller has his boats swung out
he is standing amidst a crowd of uncertain passengers in all states of dress and undress
one first class woman is barefoot
others are in stockings
the maitre of the restaurant is in top hat and overcoat
others are still in evening dress while some are in bathrobes and kimonos
women are wearing lifebelts over velvet gowns then topping it with sble stoles
some brought jewels others books even small dogs
lightoller sees smith walking stiffly toward him and quickly goes to him
he yells into the captains ear through cupped hands over the roar of the steam
hadnt we better get the women and children into the boats sir
smith just nods a bit abstractly
the fire has gone out of him
lightoller sees the awesome truth in smiths face
to the men right
start the loading
women and children
the appalling din of escaping steam abruptly cuts off leaving a sudden unearthly silence in which lightollers voice echoes
on wallace hartley raising his violin to play
ready and the band has reassembled just outside the first class entrance port side near where lightoller is calling for the boats to be loaded
they strike up a waltz lively and elegant
the music wafts all over the ship
step into the boat
finally one soman steps across the gap into the boat terrified of the drop to the water far below
theyll put us off in these silly little boats to freeze and well all be back on board by breakfast
cal rose and ruth come out of the doors near the band
my brooch i left my brooch
i must have it
she turns back to go to her room but cal takes her by the arm refusing to let her go
the firmness of his hold surprises her
stay here ruth
ruth sees his expression and knows fear for the first time
it is chaos with stewards pushing their way through narrow corridors clogged with peopel carrying suitcases duffel bags children
some have lifebelts on others dont
to steward i told the stupid sods no luggage
aw bloody hell
he throws up his hand at the sight of a family loaded down with cases and bags completely blocking the corridor
fabrizio and tommy push past the stewards going the other way
they rech a huge crowd gathered at the bottom of the main rd class stairwell
fabrizio spots helga with the rest of the dahl family standing patiently with suitcases in hand
he reaches her and she grins hugging him
tommy pushes to where he can see whats holding up the group
there is a steel gate across the top of the stairs with several stewards and seamen on the other side
stay calm please
its not time to go up to the boats yet
near tommy an irishwoman stands stoically with two small children and their battered luggage
what are we doing mummy
were just waiting dear
when they fiish putting first class people in the boats theyll be startin with us and well want to be all ready wont we
boat is less than half full with aboard a boat made for
by the left and right together stady lads
the boat lurches as the falls start to pay out through the pulley blocks
the women gasp
the boat descends swaying and jerking toward the water feet below
the passengers are terrified
tracking along the rows of portholes angling down into the water
under the surface they glow green
pushing in on one porthole which is have submerged
inside we see jack looking apprehensively at the water rising up the glass
inside the master at arms office jack sits chained to the waterpipe next to the porthole
lovejoy sits on the edge of a desk
he puts a
bullet on the desk and watches it roll across and fall off
he picks up the bullet
i believe this ship may sink
crosses to jack ive been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation
he punches jack hard in the stomach knocking the wind out of him
compliments of mr
lovejoy flips the handcuff key in the air catches it and puts it in his pocket
jack is left gasping handcuffed to the pipe
at the stairwell rail on the bridge wing fourth officer boxhall and quartermaster rowe light the first distress rocket
it shoots into the sky and explodes with a thunderclap over the ship sending out white starbursts which light up the entire deck as they fall
whip pan off the starbursts to ismay
the managing director of white star line is cracking
already at the breaking point from his immense guilt the rocket panics him
he starts shouting at the officers struggling with the falls of boat
there is no time to waste
yelling and waving his arms lower away
fifth officer lowe a baby faced and the youngest officer looks up from the tangled falls at the madman
get out of the way you fool
do you know who i am
lowe not having a clue nor caring squares up to ismay
youre a passenger
and im a ships bloody officer
now do what youre told
turning away steady men
stand by the falls
numbly backing away yes quite right
second officer lightoller is loading the boat nearest cal and rose
women and children only
sorry sir no men yet
another rocket bursts overhead lighting the crowd
startled faces turn upward
fear now in the eyes
daniel marvin has his biograph camera set up cranking away
hoping to get an exposure off the rockets light
he has mary posed in front of the scene at the boats
youre afraid darling
scared to death
either she suddenly learned to act or she is petrified
rose watches the farewells taking pace right in front of her as they step closer to the boat
husbands saying goodbye to wives and children
lovers and friends parted
nearby molly is getting a reluctant woman to board the boat
come on you heard the man
get in the boat sister
will the lifeboats be seated according to class
i hope theyre not too crowded oh mother shut up
ruth freezes mouth open dont you understand
the water is freezing and there arent enough boats
not enough by half
half the people on this ship are going to die
not the better half
push in on roses face as it hits her like a thunderbolt
jack is third class
he doesnt stand a chance
another rocket bursts overhead bathing her face in white light
you unimaginable bastard
come on ruth get in the boat
these are the first class seats right up here
molly practically hands her over to lightoller then looks around for some other women who might need a push
come on rose
youre next darlin
rose steps back shaking her head
rose get in the boat
ruth standing in the tippy lifeboat can do nothing
cal grabs roses arm but she pulls free and walks away through the crowd
cal catches up to rose and grabs her again roughly
where are you going
is that it
to be a whore to that gutter rat
id rather be his whore than your wife
he clenches his jaw and squeezes her arm viciously pulling her back toward the lifeboat
rose pulls out a hairpin and jabs him with it
he lets go with a curse and she runs into the crowd
stuff a sock in it would ya ruth
shell be along
the boat lurches downward as the falls are paid out
tracking with rose as she runs through the clusters of people
she looks back and a furious cal is coming after her
she runs breathlessly up to two proper looking men
that man tried to take advantage of me in the crowd
appalled they turn to see cal running toward them
rose runs on as the two men grab cal restraining him
she runs throught the first class entrance
cal breaks free and runs after her
he reaches the entrance but runs into a knot of people coming out
he pushes rudely through them
cal runs in and down to the landing pushing past the gentlemen and ladies who are filling up the stairs
he scans the a deck foyer
rose is gone
the hull of titanic looms over boat like a cliff
its enormous mass is suddenly threatening to those in the tiny boat
quartermaster hitchins at the tiller wants nothing but to get away from the ship
unfortunately his two seamen cant row
they flail like a duck with a broken wing
away from the ship
aint you boys ever rowed before
here gimme those oars
ill show ya how its done
she climbs over ruth to get at the oars stepping on her feet
around them the evacuation is in full swing with boats in the water others being lowered
jack pulls on the pipe with all his strength
its not budging
he hears gurgling sound
water pours under the door spreading rapidly across the floor
he tries to pull one hand out of the cuffs working until the skin is raw
can anybody hear me
to himself this could be bad
the corridor outside is deserted
flooded a couple of inches deep
jacks voice comes faintly through the door but there is no one to hear it
thomas andrews is opening stateroom doors checking that people are out
anyone in here
rose runs up to him breathless
andrews thank god
where would the master at arms take someone under arrest
you have to get to a boat right away
ill do this with or without your help sir
but without will take longer
beat take the elevator to the very bottom go left down the crewmans passage then make a right
bottom left right
i have it
rose runs up as the last elecator operator is closing up his lift to leave
sorry miss lifts are closed without thinking she grabs him and shoves him back into the lift
im through with being polite goddamnit
i may never be polite the rest of my life
now take me down
the operator fumbles to close the gate and start the lift
molly and the two seamen are rowing and theyve made it a hundret feet or so
enough to see that the ship is angled down into the water with the bow rail less than ten feet above the surface
come on girls join in itll keep ya warm
lets go ruth
grab an oar
ruth just stares at the spectacle of the great liner its rows of lights blazing slanting down into the sullen black mirror of the atlanic
through the wrought iron door of the elevator car rose can see the decks going past
the lift slows
suddenly ice water is swirling around her legs
she screams in surprise
so does the operator
the car has landed in a foot of freezing water shocking the hell out of her
she claws the door open and splashes out hiking up her floor length skirt so she can move
the lift goes back up behind her as she looks around
left crew passage
she spots it and slogs down the flooded corridor
the place is understandably deserted
she is on her own
she turns into a cross corridor splashing down the hall
a row of doors on each side
jack is hopelessly pulling on the pipe again straining until he turns red
he collapses back on the bench
realizing hes screwed
then he hears her through the door
in the hall rose hears his voice behind her
she spins and runs back locating the right door then pushes it open creating a small wave
she splashes over jack and puts her arms around him
jack jack jack
im sorry im so sorry
they are so happy to see each other its embarrassing
that guy lovejoy put it in my pocket
i know i know
see if you can find a key for these
try those drawers
its a little brass one
she kisses his face and hugs him again then starts to go through the desk
how did you find out i didnt do it
she looks at him i just realized i already knew
they share a look then she goes back to ransacking the room searching drawers and cupboards
jack sees movement out the porthole and looks out
a lifeboat hits the surface of the water seen from below
while the seamen detach the falls boat one rocks next to the hull
lucile and sir cosmo duff gordon sit with ten others in a boat made for four times that many
i despise small boats
i just know im going to be seasick
i always get seasick in small boats
good heavens theres a man down there
in a lit porthole beneath the surface she sees jack looking up at her
a face in a bubble of light under the water
rose stops trashing the room and stands there breathing hard
theres no key in here
they look around at the water now almost two feet deep
jack has pulled his feet up onto the bench
you have to go for help
nodding ill be right back
ill wait here
she runs out looking back at him once from the doorway then splashes away
jack looks down at the swirling water
rose splashes down the hall to a stairwell going up to the next deck
she climbs the stairs her long skirt leaving a trail like a giant snail
the weight of it is really slowing her down
she rips at the buttons and shimmies quickly out of the thing
she bounds up the stairs in her stockings and knee length slip to find herself in a long corridor
part of the labyrinth of steerage hallways forward
she is alone here
a long groan of stressing metal echoes along the hall as the ship continues to settle
she runs down the hall unimpeded now
she turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze
the hall slopes down into water which shimmers reflecting the light
the margin of the water creeps toward her
a young man appears running through the water sending up geysers of spray
he pelts past her without slowing his eyes crazed
we need help
he doesnt look back
it is like a bad dream
the hull gongs with terrifying sounds
the lights flicker and go out leaving utter darkness
then they come back on
she finds herself hyperventilating
that one moment of blackness was the most terrifying of her life
a steward runs around the nearest corner his arms full of lifebelts
he is upset to see someone still in his section
he grabs her forcefully by the arm pulling her with him like a wayward child
come on then lets get you topside miss thats right
i need your help
theres no need for panic miss
no let me go
youre going the wrong way
hes not listening
and he wont let her go
she shouts in his ear and when he turns she punches him squarely in the nose
shocked he lets her go and staggers back
to hell with you
see you there buster
the steward runs off holding his bloody nose
she spits after him
just the way jack taugh her
she turns around sees a glass case with a fire axe in it
she breaks the glass with a battered suitcase which is lying discarded nearby and seizes the axe running back the way she came
at the stairwell she looks down and gasps
the water has flooded the bottom five steps
she goes down and has to crouch to look along the corridor to the room where jack is trapped
rose plunges into the water which is up to her waist
and powers forward holding the axe above her head in two hands
she grimaces at the pain from the literally freezing water
jack has climbed up on the bench and is hugging the waterpipe
rose wades in holding the axe above her head
will this work
well find out
they are both terrified but trying to keep panic at bay
he positions the chain connecting the two cuffs stretching it taut across the steel pipe
the chain is of course very short and his exposed wrists are on either side of it
try a couple practice swings
rose hefts the axe and thunks it into a wooden cabinet
now try to hit the same mark again
she swings hard and the blade thunks in four inches from the mark
okay thats enough practice
he winces bracing himself as she raises the axe
she has to hit a target about an inch wide with all the foce she can muster with his hands on either side
sounding calm you can do it rose
hit it as hard as you can i trust you
jack closes his eyes
so does she
the axe comes down
rose gingerly opens her eyes looks
jack is grinning with two separate cuffs
rose drops the axe all the strength going out of her
nice work there paul bunyan
he climbs down into the water next to her
he cant breathe for a second
excuse my french
ow ow ow that is cold
come on lets go
they wade out into the hall
rose starts toward the stiars going up but jack stops her
there is only about a foot of the stairwell opening visible
we gotta find another way out
tight on the letters titanic painted two feet high on the bow of the doomed steamer
once feet above the waterline they now quietly slip below the surface
we see them gold on black rippling and dimming to a pale green as they go deeper
in boat six ruth looks back at the titanic transfixed by the sight of the dying liner
the bowsprit is now barely above the waterline
another of boxhalls rockets explodes overhead
it lights up the whole area and we see half a dozen boats in the water spreading out from the ship
now theres somethin you dont see every day
the widest passageway in the ship it is used by crew and steerage alike and runs almost the length of the ship
right now steerage passengers move along it like refugees heading aft
a wooden doorframe splinters and the door bursts open under the force of jacks shoulder
jack and rose stumble through into the corridor
a steward who was nearby herding people along marches over
youll have to pay for that you know
thats white star line property turning together shutup
jack leads her past the dumbfounded steward
they join the steerage stragglers going aft
in places the corridor is almost completely blocked by large families carrying all their luggage
an irish woman gives rose a blanket more for modesty than because she is blue lipped and shivering
here lass cover yerself
jack rubs her arms and tries to warm her up as they walk along
the womans husband offers them a flask of whiskey
thisll take the chill off
rose takes a mighty belt and hands it to jack
he grins and follows suit
jack tries a number of doors and iron gates along the way finding them all locked
on the boat deck the action has moved to the aft group of boats numbers and on the starboard side and and on the port side
the pace of work is more frantic
you see crew and officers running now to work the davits their previous complacency gone
cal pushes through the crowd scanning for rose
around him is chaos and confusion
a woman is calling for a child who has become seperated from the crowd
a man is shouting over peoples heads
a woman takes hold of second officer lightollers arm as he is about to launch boat
will you hold the boat a moment
i have to run back to my room for something lightoller grabs her and shoves her bodily into the boat
thomas andrews rushes up to him just then
why are the boats being launched half full
lightoller steps past him helping a seaman clear a snarled fall
not now mr
pointing down at the water there look
twenty or so in a boat built for sixty five
and i saw one boat with only twelve
we were not sure of the weight rubbish
they were tested in belfast with the weight of men
now fill these boats mr
for gods sake man
the shot hands off to cal who sees lovejoy hurrying toward him through the aisle connecting the port and starboard sides of the boat deck
shes not on the starboard side either
were running out of time
and this strutting martinet
indicating lightoller isnt letting any men in at all
the one on the other side is letting men in
then thats our play
but were still going to need some insurance
he starts off forward come on
cal charges off heading forward followed by lovejoy
the shot hands off to a finely dressed elderly couple ida and isador strauss
please ida get into the boat
weve been together for forty years and where you go i go
dont argue with me isador you know it does no good
he looks at her with sadness and great love
they embrace gently
at the bow
the place where jack and rose first kissed
the bow railing goes under water water
water swirls around the captsans and windlasses on the focsle deck
smith strides to the bridge rail and looks down at the well deck
water is shipped over the sides and the well deck is awash
two men run across the deck their feet sending up spray
behind smith boxhall fires another rocket
fabrizio standing with helga dahl and her family hears jacks voice
fabrizio turns and sees jack and rose pushing through the crowd
he and jack hug like brothers
the boats are all going
we gotta get up there or were gonna be gargling saltwater
fabrizio points over the heads of the solidly packed crowd to the stairwell
tommy has his hands on the bars of the steel gate which blocks the head of the stairwell
the crew open the gate a foot or so and a few women are squeezing through
but some terrified men not understanding english try to rush through the gap forcing the gate open
the crewmen and stewards push them back shoving and punching them
get back you lot
to the crewmen lock it
they struggle to get the gate closed again while steward brandishes a small revolver
another holds a fire axe
they lock the gate and a cry goes up among the crowd who surge forward pounding against the steel and shouting in several languages
for the love of god man there are children down here
let us up so we can have a chance
but the crewmen are scared now
they have let the situation get out of hand and now they have a mob
tommy gives up and pushes his way back through the crowd going down the stairs
he rejoins jack rose and fabrizio
its hopeless that way
well whatever were goin to do we better do it fast
fabrizio turns to helga praying he can make himself understood
with a lot of hand gestures everyone
all of you
come with me now
we go to the boats
we go to the boats
they cant understand what hes saying
they can see his urgency but oluf dahl the patriarch of the family shakes his head
he will not panic and will not let his family go with this boy
fabrizio turns to helga
come with me i am lucky
is my destiny to go to america
she kisses him then steps back to be with her family
jack lays a hand on his shoulder his eyes saying lets go
i will never forget you
he turns to jack who leads the way out of the crowd
looking back fabrizio sees her face disappear into the crowd
cal opens his safe and reaches inside
as lovejoy watches he pulls out two stacks of bills still banded by bank wrappers
then he takes out heart of the ocean putting it in the pocket of his overcoat and locks the safe
holding up stacks of bills i make my own luck
in his waistband so do i
cal grins putting the money in his pocket as they go out
jack rose fabrizio and tommy are lost searching for a way out
they push past confused passengers
past a mother changing her babys diaper on top of an upturned steamer trunk
past a woman arguing heatedly with a man in serbo croatian a wailing child next to them
past a man kneeling to console a woman who is just sitting on the floor sobbing
and past another man with an english arabic dictionary trying to figure out what the signs mean while his wife and children wait patiently
jack et al come upon a narrow stairwell and they go up two decks before they are stopped by a small group pressed up against a steel gate
the steerage men are yelling at a scared steward
go to the main stairwell with everyone else
itll all get sorted out there
jack takes one look at this scene and finally just loses it
god damn it to hell son of a bitch
he grabs one end of a bench bolted to the floor on the landing
he starts pulling on it and tommy and fabrizio pitch in until the bolts shear and it breaks free
rose figures out what they are doing and clears a path up the stairs between the waiting people
quickly move aside
jack and tommy run up the steps with the bench and ram it into the gate with all their strength
it rips loose from its track and falls outward narrowly mssing the steward
led by jack the crowd surges though
rose steps up to the cowering steward and says in her most imperious tone if you have any intention of keeping your pathetic job with the white star line i
suggest you escort these good people to the boat deck
class wins out
he nods dumbly motions form them to follow
ruth rows with molly brown two other women and the incompetent sailors
she rests on her oars exhausted and looks back at the ship
it slants down into the water still ablaze with light
nothing is above water forward of the bridge except for the foremast
another rocket goes off lighting up the entire area
there are a dozen boats moving outward from the ship
at the boat deck rail captain smith is shouting to boat through a large metal megaphone
come back to the ship
chief officer wilde joins him blowing his silver whistle
from boat the whistle comes shrilly across the water
quartermaster hitchins grips the rudder in fear
the suction will pull us right down if we dont keep going
we got room for lots more
i say we go back
its our lives now not theirs
and im in charge of this boat
captain smith at the rail of the boat deck lowers his megaphone slowly the fools
as cal and lovejoy cross the foyer encounter benjamin guggenheim and his valet coth dressed in white tie tail coats and top hats
ben whats the occasion
we have dressed in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen
thats admirable ben
walking on ill sure and tell your wife
when i get to new york
there are still two cardgames in progress
the room is quiet and civilized
a silver serving cart holding a large humidor begins to roll slowly across the room
one of the cardplayers takes a cigar from it as it rolls by
it seems weve been dealt a bad hand this time
cal and lovejoy are walking aft with a purposeful stride
they pass chief baker johghin who is working up a sweat tossing deck chairs over the rail
after they go by joughin takes a break and pulls a bottle of scotch from a pocket opening it
he drains it and tosses it over the side too then stands there a little unteadily
panic is setting in around the remaining boats aft
the crowd here is now a mix of all three classes
officers repeatedly warn men back from the boats
the crowd presses in closer
seamen scarott brandishes the tiller of boat to discourage a close press of men who look ready to rush the boat
several men break ranks and rush forward
lightoller pulls out his webley revolver and aims it at them
the men back down
fifth officer lowe standing in the boat yells to the crew
lower away left and right
lightoller turns away from the crowd and out of their sight breaks his pistol open
letting out a long breath he starts to load it
cal and lovejoy arrive in time to see murdoch lowering his last boat
were too late
there are still some boats forward
stay with this one
he seems to be quite
in the water below there is another panic
boat already in the water but still attached to its falls is pushed aft by the discharge water being pumped out of the ship
it winds up directly under boat which is coming downt he right on top of it
the passengers shout in panic to the crew above to stop lowering
they are ignored
some men put their hands up trying futilely to keep the tons of boat from crushing them
fred barrett the stoker gets out his knife and leaps to the after falls climbing rudely over people
he cuts the aft falls while another crewman cuts the forward lines
drifts out from beneath just seconds before it touches the water with a slap
cal looking down from the rail hears gunshots fifth officer lowe in boat is firing his gun as a warning to a bunch of men threatening to jump into the
boat as it passes the open promenade on a deck
stay back you lot
the shots echo away
its starting to fall apart
we dont have much time
cal sees three dogs run by including the black french bulldog
someone has released the pets from the kennels
cal sees murdoch turn from the davits of boat and start walking toward the bow
he catches up and falls in beside him
murdoch im a businessman as you know and i have a business proposition for you
jack rose et al burst out onto the boat deck from the crew stairs just aft of the third funnel
they look at the empty davits
the boats are gone
she sees colonel gracie chugging forward along the deck escorting two first class ladies
are there any boats left
staring at her bedraggled state yes miss
there are still a couple of boats all the way forward
this way ill lead you
jack grabs her hand and they sprint past gracie with tommy and fabrizio close behind
angle on the band
incredibly they are still playing
jack rose and the others run by
music to drown by
now i know im in first class
water pours like a spillway over the forward railing on b deck
camera sweeps up past a deck to the boat deck where murdoch and his team are loading collapsible car the forward most davits
note there are four so called collapsibles or engelhardts boats including two which are stored on the roof of the officers quarters
the crowd is sparse with most people still aft
cal slips his hand out of hte pocket of his overcoat and into the waist pocket of murdochs greatcoat leaving the stacks of bills there
so we have an understanding then
nodding curtly as youve said
cal satisfied steps back
he finds himself waiting next to j
ismay does not meet his eyes nor anyones
lovejoy come sup to cal at that moment
ive found her
shes just over on the port side
women and children
any more women and children
glancing at cal any one else then
cal looks longingly at his boat
his moment has arrived
god damn it to hell
he and lovejoy head for the port side taking a short cut through the bridge
bruce ismay seeing his oppurtunity steps quickly into collapsible c
he stares straight ahead not meeting murdochs eyes
staring at ismay take them down
on the port side lightoller is getting people into boat
he keeps his pistol in his hand at this point
twenty feet below them the sea is pouring into the doors and windows of b deck staterooms
they can hear the roar of water cascading into the ship
women and children please
women and children only
step back sir
even with jacks arms wrapped around her rose is shivering in the cold
near her a woman with two young daughters looks into the eyes of a husband she knows she may not see again goodbye for a little while
only for a little while
to his two little girls go with mummy
the woman stumbles to the boat with the children hiding her tears from them
beneath the false good cheer the man is choked with emotion
hold mummys hand and be a good girl
some of the women are stoic others are overwhelmed by emotion and have to be helped into the boats
a man scribbles a note and hands it to a woman who is about to board
please get this to my wife in demoines iowa
jack looks at tommy and fabrizio
you better check out the other side
they nod and run off searching for a way around the deckhouse
im not going without you
get in the boat rose
cal walks up just then
get in the boat rose
she is shocked to see him
she steps instinctively to jack
cal looks at her standing there shivering in her wet slip and stockings a shocking display in
my god look at you
taking off his boat here put this on
she numbly shrugs into it
he is doing it for modesty not the cold
step into the boat
ill get the next one
not without you
she doesnt even care that cal is standing right there
he sees the emotion between jack and rose and his jaw clenches
but then he leans close to her and says
low there are boats on the other side that are allowing men in
jack and i can get off safely
both of us
he smiles reassuringly ill be alright
hurry up so we can get going
we got our own boat to catch
hurry up its almost full
lightoller grabs her arm and pulls her toward the boat
she reaches out for jack and her fingers brush his for a moment
then she finds herself stepping down into the boat
its all a rush and blur
the two men watch at the rail as the boat begins to descend
low youre a good liar
almost as good as you
i always win jack
one way or another
looks at him smiling pity i didnt keep that drawing
its going to be worth a lot more by morning
jack knows he is screwed
he looks down at rose not wanting to waste a second of his last view of her
in slow motion the ropes going through the pulleys as the seamen start to lower
all sound going away
lightoller giving orders his lips moving
but rose hears only the blood pounding in her ears
this cannot be happening
a rocket bursts above in slow motion outlining jack in a halo of light
roses hair blowing in slow motion as she gazes up at him descending away from him
she sees his hand trembling the tears at the corners of his eyes and cannot believe the unbearable pain she is feeling
rose is still staring up tears pouring down her face
suddenly she is moving
she lunges across the women next to her
reaches the gunwale climbing it
hurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the a deck promenade catching it and scrambling over the rail
the boat continues down
but rose is back on titanic
jack spins from the rail running for the nearest way down to a deck
hockley too has seen her jump
she is willing to die for this man this gutter scum
he is overwhelmed by a rage so all consuming it eclipses all thought
tracking with jack as he bangs through the doors to the foyer and sprints down the stairs
he sees her coming into a deck foyer running toward him cals long coat flying out behind her as she runs
they meet at the bottom of the stairs and collide in an embrace
rose rose youre so stupid youre such an idiot and all the while hes kissing her and holding her as tight as he can
you jump i jump right
hockley comes in and runs to the railing
looking down he sees them locked in their embrace
lovejoy comes up behind cal and puts a restraining hand on him but cal whips around grabbing the pistol from lovejoys waistband in one cobra fast move
he runs along the rail and down the stairs
as he reaches the landing above them he raises the gun
screaming in rage he fires
the carved cherub at the foot of the center railing explodes
jack pulls rose toward the stairs going down to the next deck
cal fires again running down the steps toward them
a bullet blows a divet out of the oak panelling behind jacks head as he pulls rose down the next flight of stairs
hockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue and goes sprawling
the gun clatters across the marble floor
he gets up and reeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it
the bottom of the grand staircase is flooded several feet deep
jack and rose come down the stairs two at a time and run straight into the water fording across the room to where the floor slopes up until they reach
dry footing at the entrance to the dining saloon
steadicam with hockley as he reels down the stairs in time to see jack and rose splashing through the water toward the dining saloon
he fires twice
big gouts of spray near them but hes not a great shot
the water boils up around his feet and he retreast up the stairs a couple of steps
around him the woodward groans and creaks
calling to them enjoy your time together
lovejoy arrives next to him
cal suddenly remembers something and starts to laugh
what could possible be funny
i put the diamond in my coat pocket
and i put my coat
he turns to lovejoy with a sickly expression his eyes glittering
i give it to you
if you can get it
he hands lovejoy the pistol and goes back up the stairs
lovejoy thinks about it
then slogs into the water
the icewater is up to his waist as he crosses the pool into the dining saloon
lovejoy moves among the tables and ornate columns searching
his eyes tracking rapidly
it is a sea of tables and they could be anywhere
a silver serving tolley rolls downhill bumping into tables and pillars
he glances behind him
the water is following him into the room advancing in a hundred foot wide tide
the reception room is now a roiling lake and the grand staircase is submerged past the first landing
monstrous groans echo through the ship
on jack and rose crouched behind a table somewhere in the middle
they see the water advancing toward them swirling over the floor
they crawl ahead of it to the next row of tables
whispering stay here
he moves off as lovejoy moves over one row and looks along the tables
the ship groans and creaks
he moves another row
angle on a metal cart
five feet tall and full of stacks of china dishes
it starts to roll down the aisle between tables
on rose as the cart rolls toward her
it hits a table and the stacks of dishes topple out exploding across the floor and showering her
she scrambles out of the way and lovejoy spins seeing her
he moves rapidly toward her keeping the gun aimed thats when jack tackles him from the side
they slam together into a table crashing over it and toppling to the floor
they land in the water which is flowing rapidly between the tables
jack and lovejoy grapple in the icy water
jack jams his knee down on lovejoys hand breaking his grip on the pistol and kicks it away
lovejoy scrmbles up and lunges at him but jack gutpuches him right in the solar plexus doubling him over
compliments of the chippewa falls dawsons
he grabs lovejoy and slams him into an ornate columb
lovejoy drops to the floor with a splas stunned
jack and rose run aft
entering the galley
behind them the tables have become islands in a lake
and the far end of the room is flooded up to the ceiling
lovejoy gets up and looks around for his gun
he pulls it up out of the water and wades after them
they run throught the galley and rose spots the stairs
she starts up and jack grabs her hand
he leads her down
they crouch together on the landing as lovejoy runs to the stairs
assuming they have gone up who wouldnt
he clombs up them two at a time
they wait for the footstep to recede
a long creaking groan
then they hear it
a crying child
they go down a frew steps to looks along the next deck
the corridor is awash about a foot deep
standing against the wall about feet away is a little boy aobut
the water swirls around his legs and he is wailing
we cant leave him
jack nods and they leave the promise of escape up the stairwell to run to the child
jack scoops up the kid and they run back to the stairs but a torrent of water comes pouring down the stairs like rapids
in seconds it is too powerful for them to go against
charging the other way down the flooding corridor they blast up spray with each footstep
at the end of the hall are heavy double doors
as jack approaches them he sees water spraying through the gap between the doors right up to the ceiling
the doors groan and start to crack under the tons of pressure
rose pivots and runs back the way they came taking a turn into a cross corridor
a man is coming the other way
he sees the boy in jacks arms and cries out grabbing him away from jack
starts cursing him in russian
he runs on with the boy no
not that way
double doors blast open
a wall of water thunders into the corridor
the father and child disappear instantly
jack and rose run as a wave blasts around the corner foaming from floor to ceiling
it gains on them like a locomotive
they make it to a stairway going up
jack and rose pound up the steps as white water swirls up behind them
pull back to reveal that a steel gate blocks the top of the stairs
jack slams against the fate gripping the bars
a terrified steward standing guard on the landing above turns to run at the sight of the water thundering up the stairs
unlock the gate
the steward runs on
the water wells up around jack and rose pouring through the gate and slamming them against it
in seconds it is up to their waist
the steward stops and looks back
he sees jack and rose at the gate their arms raching through
sees the water pouring through the gate onto the landing
he runs back slogging against the curretn
he pulls a key ring from his belt and struggles to unlock the padlock as the water fountains up around them
the lights short out and the landing is plunged into darkness
the water rises over the lock and hes doing it by feel
jack and rose are right up against the ceiling
suddenly the gate gives and swings open
they are pushing through by the force of the water
they make it to stairs on the other side of the landing and follow the steward up to the next deck
cal comes reeling out of the first class entrance looking wild eyed
the lurches down the deck toward the bridge
waltz music wafts over the ship
somewhere the band is still playing
cals pov a little girl maybe two years old is crying along in the alcove
she looks up at cal beseechingly
cal moves on without a glance back
reaching a large crowd clustered around collapsible a just aft of the bridge
he sees murdoch and a number of crewmen struggling to drag the boat to the davits with no luck
cal pushes forward trying to signal murdoch but the officer ignores him
nearby tommy and fabrizio are being pushed forward by the crowd behind
purser mcelroy pushes them back getting a couple of seamen to help him
he brandishes his gun waving it in the air yelling for the crowd to stay back
lightoller with a group of crew and passengers is trying to get collapsible b down from the roof
they slide it down a pair of oars leaned against the deck house
the weight of the boat snaps the oars and it crashes to the deck upside down
the two swedish cousins olaus and bjorn gunersen jump back as the boat nearly hits them
jack and rose run up seemingly endless stairs as the ship groans and torgues around them
murdoch at collapsible a is no longer in control
the crowd is threatening to rush the boat
they push and jostle yelling and shouting at the officers
the pressure from behind pushes them forward and one guy falls off the edge of the deck into the water less than ten feet below
give us a chance to live you limey bastards
murdoch fires his webley twice in the air then point it at the crowd
ill shoot any man who tries to get past me
cal steps up to him
we had a deal damn you
murdoch pushes him back pointing the pistol at cal
a man next to tommy rushes forward and tommy is shoved from behind
murdoch shoots the first man and seeing tommy coming forward puts a bullet into his chest
tommy collapses and fabrizio grabs him holding him in his arms as his life flows out over the deck
murdoch turns to his men and salutes smartly
then he puts the pistol to his temple and
he drops like a puppet with the strings cut and topples over the edge of the boat deck into the water only a few feet below
cal stares in horror at murdochs body bobbing in the black water
the money floats out of the pocket of his greatcoat the bills spreading across the surface
the crew rush to get the last few women aboart the boat
calling above the confusion any more women or children
the child crying in the alcove
cal scoops her up and runs forward cradling her in his arms
forcing his way through the crowd heres a child
ive got a child
to mcelroy please
im all she has in the world
mcelroy nods curtly and pushes him into the boat
he spins with his gun brandishing it in the air to keep the other men back
cal gets into the boat holding the little girl
he takes a seat with the women
thomas andrews stands in front of the fireplace staring at the large painting above the mantle
the fire is still going in the fireplace
the room is empty except for andrews
an ashtray falls off the table
behind him jack and rose run into the room out of breath and soaked
they run through toward the aft revolving door
then rose recognizes him
she sees that his lifebelt is off lying on a table
wont you even make a try for it mr
a tear rolls down his cheek im sorry that i didnt build you a stronger ship young rose
to her its going fast
weve got to keep moving
andrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her
good luck to you rose
hugging him and to you mr
jack pulls her away and they run through the revolving door
the band finishes the waltz
wallace hartley looks at the orchestra members
right thats it then
they leave him walking forward along the deck
hartley puts his violin to his chin and bows the first notes of nearer my god to thee
one by one the band memebers turn hearing the lonely melody
without a word they walk back and take their places
they join in with hartley filling out the sound so that it reaches all over the ship on this still night
the vocalist begins if in my dreams i be nearer my god to thee
a seaman pulls off his lifebelt and catches up to captain smith as he walks to the bridge
he proffers it but smith seems to stare through him
without a word he turns and goes onto the bridge
he enters the enclosed wheelhouse and closes the door
he is alone surrounded by the gleaming brass instruments
he seems to inwardly collapse
in the first class smoking room andrews stands like a statue
he pulls out his pocketwatch and checks the time
then he opens the face of the mantle clock and adjusts it to the correct time a
everything must be correct
in cals parlour suite water swirls in from the private promenade deck
roses paintings are submerged
the picasso tranforms under the waters surface
degas colors run
monets water lilies come to life
downangle on the two figures lying side by side fully clothed on a bed in a first class cabin
elderly ida and isador strauss stare at the ceiling holding hands like young lovers
water pours into the room through a doorway
it swirls around the bed two feet deep rising fast
in a steerage cabin somewhere in the bowels of the ship the young irish mother seen earlier stoically waiting at the stairs is tucking her two young children into bed
she pulls up the covers making sure they are all warm and cozy
she lies down with them on the bed speaking soothingly and holding them
in a wide shot we see a wave travel up the boat deck as the bridge house sinks into the water
on the port side collapsible b is picked up by water
working frantically the men try to detach it from the falls so the ship wont drag it under
colonel gracie hands lightoller a pocket knife and he saws furiously at the ropes as the water swirls around his legs
the boat still upside down is swept off the ship
men start diving in swimming to stay with it
in collapsible a cal sits next to the wailing child whom he has completely forgotten
he watches the water rising around the men as they work scrambling to get the ropes cut so the ship wont drag the collapsible under
fabrizio removes the lifebelt from tommys body and struggles to put it on as the water rises around him
captain smith standing near the wheel watches the black water climbing the windows of the enclosed wheelhouse
he has the stricken expression of a damned sould on judgment day
the windows burst suddenly and a wall of water edged with shards of glass slams into smith
he disappears in a vortex of foam
collapsible a is hit by a wave as the bow plunges suddenly
it partially swamps the boat washing it along the deck
over a hundred passengers are plunged into the freezing water and the area around the boat becomes a frenzy of splashing screaming people
as men are trying to climb into the callapsible cal grabs an oar and pushes them back into the water
youll swamp us
fabrizio swimming for his life gets swirled under a davit
the ropes and pulleys tangle around him as the davit goes under the water and he is dragged down
underwater he struggles to free himself and then kicks back to the surface
he surfaces gasping for air in the freezing water
wallace hartley sees the water rolling rapidly up the deck toward them
he holds the last note of the hymn in a sustain and then lowers his violin
gentlemen it has been a previlege playing with you tonight
jack and rose run out of the palm court into a dense crowd
jack pushes his way to the rail and looks at the state of the ship
the bridge is under water and tehre is chaos on deck
jack helps her put her lifebelt on
people stream around them shouting and pushing
we keep moving aft
we have to stay on the ship as long as possible
they push their way aft through the panicking crowd
collapsible a is whirled like a leaf in the currents around the sining ship
it slams against the side of the forward funnel
to the crew in the boat row
row you bastards
nearby fabrizio is drawn up against the grating of a stokehold vent as water pours through it
the force of tons of water roaring down the ship traps him against it and he is dragged down under the surface as the ship sinks
he struggles to free himself but cannot
suddenly there is a concussion deep in the bowels of the ship as a furnace explodes and a blast of hot air belches out of hte ventilator ejecting fabrizio
he surfaces in a roar of foam and keeps swimming
jack and rose clamber over the a deck aft rail
then using all his strength he lowers her toward the deck below holding on with one hand
she dangles then falls
jack jumps down behind her
they join a crush of people literally clawing and scrambling over each other to get down the narrow stairs to the well deck
the only way aft
seeing that the stairs are impossible jack climbs over the b deck railing and helps rose over
he lowers her again and she falls in a heap
baker joughin now three sheets to the wind happens to be next to her
he hauls rose to her feet
jack drops down and the three of them push through the crowd across the well deck
near them at the rail people are jumping into the water
the ship groans and shudders
the man ahead of jack is walking like a zombie
yeah though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death you wanna walk a little faster through that valley fella
the stay cables along the top of the funnel snap and they lash like steel whips down into the water
cal watches as the funnel topples from its mounts
falling like a temple pillar twenty eight feet across it whomps into the water with a tremendous splash
people swimming underneath it disappear in an instant
fabrizio a few feet away is hurled back by a huge wave
he comes up gasping
the water pouring into the open end of the funnel draws in several swimmers
the funnel sinks disappearing but hundreds of tons of water pour down through the foot hole where the funnel stood thundering down into the belly of the ship
a whirlpool forms a hole in the ocean like at enormous toiler flush
mccauley the gym instructor swims in a frenzy as the vortex draws him in
he is sucked down like a spider going down a drain
fabrizio nearby swims like hell as more people are sucked down behind him
he manages to get clear
hes going to live no matter what it takes
water raors through the doors and windows cascading down the stairs like a rapids
john jacob astor is swept down the marble steps to a deck which is already flooded
a roiling vortex
he grabs the headless cherub at the bottom of the staircase and wraps his arms around it
astor looks up in time to see the foot glass dome overhead explose inward with the wave of water washing over it
a niagara of sea water thunders down into the room blasting through the first class opulence
it is the armageddon of elegance
the flooding is horrific
walls and doors are splintered like kindling
water roars down corridors with pile driver force
the cartmell family is at the top of a stairwell jammed against a locked gate like jack and rose were
water boils up the stairwell behind them
bert cartmell shakes the gate futilely shouting for help
little cora wails as the water boils up around them all
rose and jack struggle to climb the well deck stairs as the ship tilts
drunk baker joughin puts a hand squarely on roses butt and shoves her up onto the deck
hundreds of people are already on the poop deck and more are pouring up every second
jack and rose cling together as tehy struggle across the tilting deck
as the bow goes down the stern rises
in boat which is just off the stern passengers gape as the giant bronze propellers rise out of the water like gods of the deep filling frame behind them
people are jumping from the well deck the poop deck the gangway doors
some hit debris in the water and are hurt or killed
on the poop deck jack and rose struggle aft as the angle increases
hundreds of passengers clinging to every fixed object on deck huddle on their knees around father byles who has his voice raised in prayer
they are praying sobbing or just staring at nothing their minds blank with dread
pulling himself from handhold to handhold jack tugs rose aft along the deck
come on rose
we cant expect god to do all the work for us
they struggle on pushing through the praying people
a man loses his footing ahead and slides toward them
jack helps him
the propellers are twenty feet above the water and rising faster
jack and rose make it to the stern rail right at the base of the flagpole
they grip the rai jammed in between other people
it is the spot where jack pulled her back onto the ship just two night
and a liftime
above the wailing and sobbing father byles voice carries cracking with emotion
and i saw new heavens and a new earth
the former heavens and the former earth had passed away and the sea was no longer
the lights flicker threatening to go out
rose grips jack as the stern rises into a night sky ablaze with stars
i also saw a new jerusalem the holy city coming down out of heaven from god beautiful as a bride prepared to meet her husband
i heard a loud voice from the throne ring out this is gods dwelling among men
he shall dwell with them and they shall be his people and he shall be their god who is alway with them
rose stares about her at the faces of the doomed
near them are the dahl family clinging together stoically
helga looks at her briefly and her eyes are infinitely sad
rose sees a young mother next to her clutching her five year old son who is crying in terror
itll be over soon darling
itll all be over soon
he shall wipe every tear from their eyes
and there shall be no more death or mourning crying out or pain for the former world has passed away
as the ship tilts further everything not bolted down inside shifts
cupboards burst open in the pantry showering the floor with tons of china
a piano slides across the floor crashing into a wall
furniture tumbles across the smoking room floor
on the a deck promenade passengers lose their grip and slide down the wooden deck like a bobsled run hundreds of feet before they hit the water
trudy bolt roses maid slips as she struggles along the railing and slides away screaming
at the stern the propellers are feet out of the water and rising
panicking people leap from the poop deck rail fall screaming and hit the water like mortar rounds
a man falls from the poop deck hitting the bronze hub of the starboard propeller with a sickening smack
swimmers look up and see the stern towering over them like a monolith the propellers rising against the stars
at the stern rail a man jumps
in his pov we fall seemingly forever right past one of the giant screws
the water rushes up tracking slowly in on ruth as the sounds of the dying ship and the screaming people come across the water
reverse her pov in a wide shot we see the spectacle of the titanic her lights blazing reflecting in the still water
its stern is high in the air angles up over forty five degrees
the propellers are feet out of the water
over a thousand passengers cling to the decks looking from a distance like a swarm of bees
the image is shocking unbelieveable unthinkable
ruth stares at the spectacle unable to frame it or put it into any proportion
the great liners lights flicker
in darkness chief engineer bell hangs onto a pipe at the master braker panel
around him men climb through tilted cyclopean mahcines with electric hand torches
it is a black hell of breaking pipes spraying water and groaning machinery threatening to tear right out of its bedplates
water sprays down hitting the breaker panel but bell will not leave his post
the breakers kick
he slams them in again and whoom
a blast of light
something melts and arcing fills the engine room with nightmarish light wide shot
the lights go out all over the ship
titanic becomes a vast black silhouette against the stars
in collapsible c bruce ismay has his back to the ship unable to watch the great steamer die
he is catatonic with remorse his mind overloaded
he can avert his eyes but he cant block out the sounds of dying people and machinery
a loud cracking report comes across the water
near the third funnel a man clutches the ships rail
he stares down as the deck splits right between his feet
a yawning chasm opens with a thunder of breaking steel lovejoy is clutching the railing on the roof of the officers mess
he watches in horror as the ships structure rips apart right in front of him
he gapes down into a widening maw seeing straight down into the bowels of the ship amid a booming concussion like the sound of artillery
people falling into the widening crevasse look like dolls
the stay cables on the funnel part and snap across the decks like whips ripping off davits and ventilators
a man is hit by a whipping cable and snatched out of frame
another cable smashes the rail next to lovejoy and it rips free
he falls backward into the pit of jagged metal
fires explosions and sparks light the yawning chasm as the hull splits down through nine decks to the keel
the sea pours into the gaping wound it is a thundering black hell
men scream as monstrous machinery comes apart around them steel frames twisting like taffy
their torches illuminate the roaring foaming demon of water as it races at the through the manchines
trying to climb they are overtaken in seconds
the stern alf of the ship almost four hundred feet long falls back toward the water
on the poop deck everyone screams as they feel themselves plummeting
the sound goes up like the roar of fans at a baseball stadium when a run is scored
swimming in the water directly under the stern a few unfortunates shriek as they see the keel coming down on them like gods bootheel
the massive stern section falls back almost level thundering down into the sea and pushing out a mighty wave of displaced water
jack and rose struggle to hole onto the stern rail
they feel the ship seemingly right itself
some of those praying think it is salvation
jack looks at rose and shakes his head grimly
now the horrible mechanics play out
pulled down by the awesome weight of the flooded bow the buoyant stern tilts up rapidly
they feel the rush of ascent as the fantail angles up again
everyone is clinging to benches railings ventilators
anything to keep from sliding as the stern lifts
the stern goes up and up past degrees then past sixty
people start to fall sliding and tumbling
they skid down the deck screaming and flailing to grab onto somehting
they wrench other people loose and pull them down as well
there is a pile up of bodies at the forward rail
the dahl family falls one by one
we have to move
he climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for rose
she is terrified to move
he grabs her hand
ive got you
jack pulls her over the rail
it is the same place he pulled her over the rail two nights earlier going the other direction
she gets over just as the railing is going horizontal and the deck veritcal
jack grips her fiercely
the stern is now straight up in the air
a rumbling black monolith standing against the stars
it hangs there like that for a long grace note its buoyancy stable
rose lies on the railing looking down fifteen stories to the boiling sea at the base of the stern section
people near them who didnt climb over hang from the railing their legs dangling over the long drop
they fall one by one plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck
some of them bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators
jack and rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull gripping the railing which is now horizontal
just beneath their feet are the gold letters titanic emblazoned across the stern
rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them
jack looks to his left and sees baker joughin crouching on the hull holding onto the railing
it is a surreal moment
nodding a greeting helluva night
the final relentless plunge begins as the stern section floods
looking down a hundred feet to the water we drop like an elevator with jack and rose
talking fast take a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water
the ship will suck us down
kick for the surface and keep kicking
dont let go of my hand
were gonna make it rose
she stares at the water coming up at them and grips his hand harder
i trust you
below them the poop deck is disappearing
the plunge gathers speed
the boiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the last thirty feet
in a high shot we see the stern descend into the boiling sea
the name titanic disappears and the tiny figures of jack and rose vanish under the water
where the ship stood now there is nothing
only the black ocean
bodies are whirled and spun some limp as dolls others struggling spasmodically as the vortex sucks them down and tumbles them
jack rises into frame f
kicking hard for the surface
holding tightly to rose pulling her up
at the surface a roiling chaos of screaming thrashing people
over a thousand people are now floating where the ship went down
some are stunned gasping for breath
others are crying praying moaning shouting
jack and rose surface among them
they barely have time to gasp for air before people are clawing at them
people driven insane by the water degrees below freezing a cold so intense it is indistinguishable form death by fire
a man pushes rose under trying to climb on top of her
senselessly trying to get out of the water to climb onto anything
jack punches him repeatedly pulling her free
she tries but her strokes are not as effective as his because of her lifejacket
they break out of the clot of people
he has to find some kind of flotation anything to get her out of the freezing water
come one you can do it
all about them there is a tremendous wailing screaming and moaning
a chorus of tormented souls
and beyond that
nothing but black water stretching to the horizon
the sense of isolation and hopelessness is overwhelming
jack strokes rhythmically the effort keeping him from freezing
look for something floating
its so cold
help me here
his words keep her focused taking her mind off the wailing around them
rose scans the water panting barely able to draw a breath
she turns and
a devil is right in from of her face
it is the black french bulldog swimming right at her like a seamonster in the darkness its coal eyes bugging
it motors past her like it is headed for newfoundland
beyond it rose sees somehting in the water
jack sees what she is pointing to and they make for it together
it is a piece of wooden debris intricately carved
he pushes her up and she slithers onto it belly down
but when jack tries to get up onto the thing it tilts and submerges almost dumping rose off
it is clearly only big enough to support her
he clings to it close to her keeping his upper body out of the water as best he can
their breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion
a man swims toward them homing in on the piece of debris
jack warns him back
its just enough for this lady
youll push it under
let me try at least or ill die soon
youll die quicker if you come any closer
yes i see
good luck to you then
swimming off god bless
the boat is overloaded and half flooded
men cling to the sides in the water
others swimming are drawn to it as their only hope
cal standing in the boat slaps his oar in the water as a warning
fabrizio exhausted and near the limit makes it almost to the boat
cal clubs him with the oar cutting open his scalp
pointing with the oar its that way
close on fabrizio as he floats panting each breath agony
you see the spirit leave him
fabrizios pov cal in slow motion yelling and wielding the oar
a demon in a tuxedo
the image fades to black
jack and rose still float amid a chorus of hte damned
jack sees the ships officer nearby chief officer wilde
he is blowing his whistle furiously knowing the sound will carry over the water for miles
the boats will come back for us rose
hold on just a little longer
they had to row away for the suction and now theyll be coming back
she nods his words helping her
she is shivering uncontrollably her lips blue and her teeth chattering
thank god for you jack
people are still screaming calling to the lifeboats
we know you can hear us
for gods sake
save one life
save on life
in boat ruth has her ears covered against the wailing in the darkness
the first class women in the boat sit stunned listening to the sounds of hundreds screaming
theyll pull us right down i tell ya
aw knock it off yer scarin me
come on girls grab your oars
nobody moves well come on
the women wont meet her eyes
they huddle into their ermine wraps
i dont understand a one of you
whats the matter with you
its your men back there
we got plenty a room for more
if you dont shut that hole in yer face therell be one less in this boat
ruth keeps her ears covered and her eyes closed shutting it all out
in boat one sir cosmo and lucile duff gordon sit with ten other people in a boat that is two thirds empty
they are two hundred yards from the screaming in the darkness
we should do something
lucile squeezes cosmos hand and pleads him with her eyes
she is terrified
its out of the question
the crewmembers intimidated by a nobleman acquiesce
they hunch guiltily hoping the sound will stop soon
twenty boats most half full float in the darkness
none of them make a move
jack and rose drift under the blazing stars
the water is glassy with only the faintest undulating swell
rose can actually see the stars reflecting on the black mirror of the sea
jack squeezes the water out of her long coat tucking it in tightly around her legs
he rubs her arms
his face is chalk with in the darkness
a low moaning in the darknes around them
its getting quiet
just a few more minutes
itll take them a while to get the boats organized
rose is unmoving just staring into space
she knows the truth
there wont be any boats
behind jack she sees that officer wilde has stopped moving
he is slumped in his lifejacket looking almost asleep
he has died of exposure already
i dont know about you but i intend to write a strongly worded letter to the white star line about all this
she laughs weakly but it sounds like a gasp of fear
rose finds his eyes in the dim light
i love you jack
he takes her hand
dont say your good byes rose
dont you give up
dont do it
im so cold
youre going to get out of this
youre going to go on and youre going to make babies and watch them grow and youre going to die an old lady warm in your bed
not this night
do you understand me
i cant feel my body
rose listen to me
winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me
jack is having trouble getting the breath to speak
it brought me to you
and im thankful rose
his voice is trembling with the cold which is working tis way to his heart
but his eyes are unwavering
you must do me this honor
promise me you will survive
that you will never give up
no matter what happens
no matter how hopeless
promise me now and never let go of that promise
never let go
i will never let go jack
ill never let go
she grips his hand and they lie with their heads together
it is quiet now except for the lapping of the water
fifth officer lowe the impetuous young welshman has gotten boats and collapsible d together with his own boat
a demon of energy hes had everyone hold the boats together and is transferring passengers from into the others to empty his boat for a rescue attempt
as the women step gingerly across the other boats lowe sees a shawled figure in too much of a hurry
he rips the shawl off and finds himself staring into the face of a man
he angrily shoves the stowaway into another boat and turns to his crew of three
right man the oars
the beam of an electric torch plays across the water like a searchlight as boat comes toward us
angle from the boat as the torch illuminates floating debris a poignant trail of flotsam a violin a childs wooden soldier a framed photo of a steerage family
daniel marvins wooden biograph camera
then their white lifebelts bobbing in the darkness like signoposts the first bodies come into the torchs beam
the people are dead but not drowned killed by the freezing water
some look like they could be sleeping
others stare with frozen eyes at the stars
soon bodies are so thick the seamen cannot row
they hit the oars on the heads of floating men and women
a wooden thunk
one seaman throws up
lowe sees a mother floating with her arms frozen around her lifeless baby
the worst moment of his life we waited too long
in a hovering downangle we see jack and rose floating in the black water
the stars reflect in the mill pond surface and the two of them seem to be floating in interstellar space
they are absolutely still
their hands are locked together
rose is staring upwards at the canopy of stars wheeling above her
the music is transparent floating
as the long sleep steals over rose and she feels peace
close on roses face
pale like the faces of the dead
she seems to be floating in a void
rose is in a semi hallucinatory state
she knows she is dying
her lips barely move as she sings a scrap of jacks song come josephine in my flying machine
roses pov the stars
like youve never seen them
the milky way a glorious band from horizon to horizon
a shooting star flares
a line of light across the heavens
tight on rose again
we see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals
her breathing is so shallow she is almost motionless
her eyes track down from the stars to the water
slow motion the silhouetter of a boat crossing the stars
she sees men in it rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water leaving weightless pearls floating in the air
the voices of the men sound slow and distorted
then the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light flares across the water silouetting the bobbing corpses in between
it flicks past her motionless form and moves on
the boat is feet away and moving past her
the men look away
rose lifts her head to turn to jack
we see that her hair has frozen to the wood under her
barely audible jack
she touches his shoulder with her free hand
he doesnt respond
rose gently turns his face toward her
it is rimed with frost
he seems to be sleeping peacefully
but he is not asleep
rose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her
all hope will and spirit leave her
she looks at the boat
it is further away now the voices fainter
rose watches them go
she closes her eyes
she is so weak and there just seems to be no reason to even try
her eyes snap open
she raises her head suddenly cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the wood
she calls out but her voice is so weak they dont hear her
the boat is invisible now the torch light a star impossibly far away
she struggles to draw breath calling again
in the boat lowe hears nothing behind him
he points to something ahead turning the tiller
rose struggles to move
her hand she realizes is actually frozen to jacks
she breaths on it melting the ice a little and gently unclasps their hands breaking away a thin tinkling film
i wont let go
she releases him and he sinks into the black water
he seems to fade out like a spirit returning to some immaterial plane
rose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water
she swims to chief officer wildes body and grabs his whistle
she starts to blow the whistle with all the strength in her body
its sound slaps across the still water
in boat lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle
turning the tiller row back
rose keeps blowing as the boat comes to her
she is still blowing when lowe takes the whistle from her mouth as they haul her into the boat
she slips into uncosciousness and they scramble to cover her with blankets
extreme closeup of roses ancient wrinkled face
fifteen hundred people went into the sea when titanic sank from under us
there were twenty boats floating nearby and only one came back
six were saved from the water myself included
six out of fifteen hundred
as she speaks the camera tracks slowly across the faces of lizzy and the salvage crew on keldysh
lovett bodine buell the others
the reality of what happened here years before has hit them like never before
with her story rose has put them on titanic in its final hours and or the first time they do feel like graverobbers
lovett for the first time has even forgotten to ask about the diamond
afterward the seven hundred people in the boats had nothing to do but waith
wait to die wait to live wait for an absolution which would never come
matching move as the camera tracks along the faces of the saved
dissolve to another boat and then another seeing faces we know among the survivors ismay in a trance just staring and trembling
cal sipping from a hip flask offered to him by a black faced stoker
ruth hugging herself rocking gently
in boat close on rose lying swaddled
only her face is visile white as the moon
the man next to her jumps up pointing and yelling
soon everyone is looking and shouting excitedly
in roses pov it is all silent in slow motion silence we see lowe light a green flare and wave it as everyone shouts and cheers
rose doesnt react
she floats beyond all human emotion
golden lgiht washes across the white boats which gloat in a calm sea reflecting the rosy sky
all around them like a flotilla of sailing ships are icebergs
the carpathia sits nearby as boats row toward her
images dissolve into one another a ships hull looming with the letters carpathia visible on the bow
rose watching rocked by the sea her face blank
seamen helping survivors up the rope ladder to the carpathias gangway doors
two women crying and hugging each other inside the ship
all silent all in slow motion
there is just music so gentle and sad part elegy part hymn part aching song of love lost forever
the images continue to music
rose outside of time outside of herself coming into carpathia barely able to stand
rose being draped wtih warm blankets and given hot tea
bruce ismay climbing aboard
he has the face and eyes of a damned soul
as ismay walks along the hall guided by a crewman toward the doctors cabin he passes rows of seated and standing widows
he must run the gauntlet of their accusing gazes
it is the afternoon of the th
cal is searching the faces of the widows lining the deck looking for rose
the deck of carpathia is crammed with huddled people and even the recovered lifeboats of titanic
on a hatch cover sits an enormous pile of lifebelts
he keeps walking toward the stern
seeing cals tuxedo a steward approaches him
you wont find any of your people back here sir
its all steerage
cal ignores him and goes amongst this wrecked group looking under shawls and blankets at one bleak face after another
rose is sipping hot tea
her eyes focus on him as he approaches her
he barely recognizes her
she looks like a refugee her matted hair hanging in her eyes
yes i lived
how awkward for you
your mother and i have been looking for you she holds up her hand stopping him
we will make a deal since that is something you understand
from this moment you do not exist for me nor i for you
you shall not see me again
and you will not attempt to find me
in return i will keep my silence
your actions last night need never come to light and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased
she fixes him with a glare as cold and hard as the ice which changed their lives
is this in any way unclear
after a long beat what do i tell your mother
tell her that her daughter died with the titanic
she stands turning to the rail
we see cal stricken with emotion
youre precious to me rose
jewels are precious
we see that in his way the only way he knows he does truly love her
after a moment he turns and walks away
that was the last time i ever saw him
he married of course and inherited his millions
the crash of hit his interests hard and he put a pistol in his mouth that year
his children fought over the scraps of his estate like hyenas or so i read
angle on rose at the railing of the carpathia pm april th
she gazes up at the statue of liberty looking just as it does today welcoming her home with her glowing torch
it is just as fabrizio saw it so clearly in his mind
later carpathia discorges the survivors at the cunard pier pier
over people line the dock and fill the surrounding streets
the magnesium flashes of the photographers go off like small bombs lighting an amazing tableau
several hundred police keep the mob back
the dock is packes with friends and reletives officials ambulances and the press reporters and photographers swarm everywhere
deep at the foot of the gangways lining the tops of cars and trucks
it is the equicalent of a media circus
they jostle to get close to the survivors tugging on them as they pass and shouting over each other to ask them questions
rose is covered with a whoollen shawl and walking with a group of steerage passengers
immigration officers are asking them questions as they come off the gangway
the officer steers her toward a holding area for processing
rose walks forward with the dazed immigrants
of photographers magnesium flashes cause them to flinch and the glare is blinding
there is a sudden disturbance near her as two men burst through the cordon running to embrace an older woman along the survivors who cries out with joy
the reporters converge on this emotional scene and flashes explode
rose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd
she pushes through the jostling people moving with purpose and none challenges her in the confusion
can you exchange one life for another
a caterpillar turns into a butterfly
if a mindless insect can do it why couldnt i
was it any more unimaginable than the sinking of the titanic
tracking with her as she walks away further and further until she flashes and the roar are far behind her and shi is till walking determined
old rose sits with the group in the imaging shack lit by the blue glow of the screens
she holds the haircomb with the jade butterfly on the handle in her gnarled hands
we never found anything on jack
theres no record of him at all
no there wouldnt be would there
and ive never spoken of him until now not to anyone
to lizzy not even your grandfather
a womans heart is a deep ocean of secrets
but now you all know there was a man named jack dawson and that he saved me in every way that a person can be saved
closing her eyes i dont even have a picture of him
he exists now only in my memory
the mir submersibles make their last pass over the ship
we hear yuri the pilot on the uqc mir one returning to surface
the sub rises off the deck of the wreck taking its light with it leaving the titanic once again it its fine and private darkness
a desultory wrap party for the expedition is in progress
there is music and some of the co ed russian crew are dancing
bodine is getting drunk in the aggressive style of baker joughin
lovett stands at the rail looking down into the black water
lizzy comes to him offering him a beer
she puts her hand on his arm
we were pissin in the wind the whole time
lovett notices a figure move through the lights far down at the stern of the ship
rose walks through the shadows of the deck machinery
her nightgown blows in the wind
her feet are bare
her hands are clutched at her chest almost as if she is praying
on lovett and lizzy running down the stairs from the top deck hauling ass
rose reaches the sern rail
her gnarled fingers wrap over the rail
her ancient foot steps up on the gunwale
she pushes herself up leaning forward
over her shoulder we see the black water glinting far below
lovett and lizzy run up behind her
dont rose turns her head looking at them
she turns further and we see she has something in her hand something she was about to drop overboard
it is the heart of the ocean
lovett sees his holy grail in her hand and his eyes go wide
rose keeps it over the railing where she can drop it anytime
dont come any closer
you had it the entire time
flash cut to a silent image of young rose walking away from pier
the photographers flashes go off like a battle behind her
she has her hands in her pockets
she stops feeling something and pulls out the necklace
she stares at it in amazement
back on keldysh rose smiles at brocks incomprehension
the hardest part about being so poor was being so rich
but every time i though of selling it i though of cal
and somehow i always got by without his help
she holds it out over the water
bodine and a couple of the other guys come up behind lovett reacting to what is in roses hand
dont drop it rose
a fierce whisper rush her
to bodine its hers you schmuck
to her look rose i
i dont know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the titanic when its not sinking and jumps back onto it when it is
were not dealing with logic here i know that
think about this a second
i came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs
the massive diamond glitters
brock edges closer and holds out his hand
just let me hold it in my hand rose
he comes closer to her
it is reminiscent of jack slowly moving up to her at the stern of titanic
surprisingly she calmly places the massice stone in the palm of his hand while still holding onto the necklace
lovett gazes at the object of his quest
an infinity of cold scalpels glint in its blue depths
it is mesmerizing
it fits in his hand just like he imagined
his grip tightens on the diamond
he looks up meeting her gaze
her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise and deep
you look for treasures in the wrong place mr
only life is priceless and making each day count
his fingers relax
he opens them slowly
gently she slips the diamond out of his hand
he feels it sliding away
then with an impish little grin rose tosses the necklace over the rail
lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to the rail in time to see it hit the water and disappear forever
that really sucks lady
brock lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a reaction
he laughs until the tears come to his eyes
then he turns to lizzy
would you like to dance
lizzy grins at him and nods
she looks up at the stars
in the black heart of the ocean the diamond sinks twinkling end over end into the infinate depths
a graceful pan across roses shelf of carefully arranged pictures rose as a young actress in california radiant
a theatrically lit studio publicity shot
rose and her husband with their two children
rose with her son at his college graduation
rose with her children and grandchildren at her th birthday
a collage of images of a life lived well
the pan stops on an image filling frame
she is at the beach sitting on a horse at the surfline
the santa monica pier with its rollercoaster is behind her
she is grinning full of life
we pan off the last picture to rose herself warm in her bunk
a profile shot
she is very still
she could be sleeping or maybe something else
the wreck of titanic looms like a ghost out of the dark
it is lit by a kind of moonlight a light of the mind
we pass over the endless forecastle deck to the superstructure moving faster than subs can move
almost like we are flying
we go inside and the echoing sound of distant waltz music is heard
the rust fades away from the walls of the dark corridor and it is transformed
we emerge onto the grand staircase lit by glowing chandelier
the music is vibrant now and the room is populated by men in tie and tails women in gowns
it is exquisitely beautiful
in pov we sweep down the staircase
the crowd of beautiful gentlmen and ladies turn as we descend toward them
at the bottom a man stands with his back to us
he turns and it is jack
smiling he holds his hand out toward us
in a side angle rose goes into his arms a girl of
the passengers officers and crew of the rms titanic smile and applaud in the utter silence of the abyss
