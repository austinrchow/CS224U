the hum of a large refrigerator just audible over the sound of indian music margaret briefly glimpsed pondering cartons of milk
the electronic peep of the cash til
a man on a mobile phone pushes past margaret who takes her place second in the queue
the female shopkeeper piles newspapers on the counter in front of margaret
distracted by images of the bombed hotel on the tv she hesitates for beat
one forty nine please
how much is the milk
forty nine pence
taking the change thank you
margaret turns to leave jostled by a tall young man wired into an ipod
margaret heads down the busy street shopping bag in hand
margaret sits at breakfast with her husband denis sipping tea
denis butters his toast
margaret shakes her head
much too much butter
i like butter
milks gone up
margaret reaches for a jug pouring milk into it sliding it down on a table
p a pint
well have to economise
i suppose we could always sell the car
chuckles or take in paying guests
he scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door watch out
shes on the prowl
margaret looks beyond denis to a a sense of growing commotion
a concerned police guard coming up the stairs meeting june early s margarets carer along a distant corridor steady on the approach
to denis eat your egg
june smiles with visible relief on seeing margaret now sitting tapping open her egg
there you are
junes look of quiet concern
margaret eats her egg
here we are
but for june she is entirely alone
i dont understand how it happened how could she possibly have got out
its very very important margaret looks out of the kitchen
her pov down the corridor of june and the policeman and a cleaner
please just make it really clear
whos on after you
margaret slips away
margaret hurries through the hall
a wide cupboard margarets eyes move back along the rail in front of her her fingers touch hanger after hanger of brown tweed and grey twill
june goes over to the curtains pulling them back letting in the sunlight beautiful day
oh youve made a start
carols coming soon ill get some bags
anything you want to go to mark ill bring up a suitcase for it
the smell of smoke lingering
suddenly denis hand reaches across wavering between jackets of brown tweed and grey twill he reaches for a suit
no no no no
the swipe of a clothes brush briefly seen drawn across one sleeve yes
distant footsteps definitely the grey
june returns oblivious righty ho
boss knows best
june spies the newspaper sees the photos of twisted carnage on the front page
dont let her take my paper away
june reaches one hand out to scoop it up in passing oh i havent had a chance to look at that yet dear
june hesitates leaves the newspaper resting on the bed as she heads off with the suit on a hanger
denis smiles as he stands in the bathroom doorway soaping his face with shaving cream he hums to himself as he resumes shaving until damn
margaret looks up denis has nicked his chin blot it
she turns sees june through the ajar door standing in the corridor looking back at her sorry
a comfortable drawing room filled with the photographs and memorabilia of a former political life
margaret stands by the window half a dozen of denis ties in her hand
pulling back the net curtain margaret peers out two policeman stand down below next to a police bmw car
they are lost in conversation pointing to the door clearly concerned
one police man nods to the other a sense of the changing of the guard as he drives off in the bmw
suddenly from behind now look what youve done
are they to keep the loonies out or you in
margaret eyes denis looking at her with wry smile ill be off then
wear your scarf
theres a chill out there
suddenly looming over her and grinning down as if at the top of a tunnel susie margarets personal secretary carrying a cardboard box
good morning lady thatcher
are you alright
concerned how are you feeling
im fine thank you susie
ive just been reading about the bombings
susies mobile goes off
she fumbles in her bag to switch it off
these are the books for you to sign
i brought as many as i could find
shall we go through your appointments
margaret looks at her still nonplussed
we said wed go through them today
margaret nods yes of course dear
the invitation has come from downing street for the unveiling of your portrait
ill put it on the mantelpiece and theres an invitation from lord armstrong for lunch on the first friday of next month
the murmur of susies voice a kind of white noise i said no because youve got a concert that afternoon but if youd like to
it looks like a very interesting programme
margarets listens oddly distracted what are they playing
susie looks at her momentarily at a loss then scrabbles back through the diary i think they said rogers and hammerstein
an orchestra in full flight a programme for the king i on a womans lap
a mans hand reaches in and her hands slips into his
whilst susie shuffles through the arrangements at the desk in the background margaret stands at the window
margarets gaze seeing denis just visible in the street below
he looks up smiles he hasnt got his scarf on
margaret throws denis a half wave
in return he twirls his umbrella and does a couple of steps of a chaplin walk for her benefit before passing the postman who is shuffling through his letters as
he approaches the front step below
susie looks on with quiet concern
margaret is at her desk signing a stack of her memoirs the downing street years
margaret opens one reaching for a pen
the curve of inky handwriting as she begins to sign them margaret thatcher
close on the swoop of the pen
without missing a beat she writes the name margaret roberts
the insistent blare of an air raid siren from another time cuts through the rumble of an approaching air raid overhead the steady shake of the table legs all around
pulls out to reveal beatrice roberts early s austere crouched next to margaret under a wide kitchen table along with alfred roberts early mid s a cumbersome man and muriel roberts yrs
the sound of an air raid siren
did someone cover the butter
all look at one another in a panic
suddenly margaret scrabbles out from under the table all look on with horror leave it
margaret margaret scooping up the butter cover slamming it quickly over the thin slice of butter left in the butter dish before sliding it into the cold cupboard underneath the
suddenly the shop illuminates a distant explosion
margaret momentarily paralyzed before running back towards the back parlour to resume her place under the table
margaret scrabbles underneath
alfred surreptitiously pats her arm
she shrugs flushing with pride
tomorrow no matter what they do itll be business as usual
the drone of the air raid dissolving away a boy and girl look on as margaret measures flour on the shop scales
two of the small beef mr
margaret glances up at her father serving further down the counter
what is the life blood of any community
alfred on a small town hall stage behind a makeshift podium
not just big business but small businesses like mine
the soft press of men all around margaret a lone woman amongst them peering over shoulders
passing hushed aside margaret
beatrice tuts shoving a tray in her hand
margaret sinks a little taking the tray and glances back at alfred just visible on a stage
we on this island are strong
were self reliant
sometimes were plain bloody minded
now at the back of the hall holding a tray loaded with dirty cups margaret watches her father back turned to the kitchen filled with women and young girls making
tea and washing up cups
but we also believe in helping each other
and i dont mean by state hand outs
margaret sweeps outside the shop glancing across the street at three pretty girls dolled up for the evening and arms linked crossing on the other side of the pavement
margaret do you want to come to the pictures
margarets eyes catch on the glitter of a broach in passing
they turn to look at her whispering and she cant come shes got to study
the flush of margarets skin miss hoity toity
the sting of embarrassment
travelling over her disparagingly
never run with the crowd margaret
go your own way
the sway of a skirt as they walk away
close to open it then
close on a telegram addressed to margaret roberts north parade grantham
margarets father alfred watching
looking up ive got a place at oxford
alfred bear hugs margaret awkwardly
margaret at her desk the ghost of a smile
dont let me down margaret
the chink of a teacup margaret looks down the corridor in expectation at beatrice standing at the sink working the squeak of the cloth against a stubborn tea stain
calling out mother
beatrice comes down the corridor into the shop wiping her hands on a cloth
alfred goes to hand beatrice the letter
shakes head my hands are still damp
beatrice turns and walks back to where she came from
margaret looks back at the letter heart bursting trying to contain her joy
margaret looks down pen in hand the words margaret roberts newly signed in the front cover
she tears the page out
margaret napping in bed
the still of the bedroom caught in the half light of a late afternoon a hand slides a teacup onto the bedside table the flicker of margarets eyelids passing hushed
beatrice tuts shoving a tray in her hand
margaret stirs again blinking awake
denis sits by the window
he is bent over a pair of spectacles wrapping wire around one of the arms with a pair of pliers
other items of clothing of his are on margarets couch
without taking his eyes of the job theyre talking about you again
the murmur of june on the phone what time is it
suns not quite over the yard arm
time for tea
a phone rings o
margaret considers denis now wearing a pink turban and confronts the extraordinary head gear
what have you got on your head
denis smiles throwing back his head the swathe of pink fabric from his turban hanging down ridiculously found it in the cupboard and thought bugger it its friday why not
margaret sits drinking her tea junes hushed tones almost audible
you look ridiculous
margaret strains to hear bosslady no like
she makes a shushing motion
as if to a bad dog no denis bosslady no like
margaret resumes listening
the door ajar the sounds of life just audible outside its taken carol so long to get her to agree to this
shes been so reluctant to let his things go
denis sinks onto the bed bored
without looking feet
he tuts and adjusts his legs so that his shoes dont dirty the bedspread
margaret stands ear pressed close to the open door you can never be sure shes taking her medication
i think sometimes she hides them
margaret looks back at her cup of tea spots two pills resting in the tea cup
she considers the pills pops them in her mouth drinks
shes definitely more distracted than usual today
a shout in the street
a womans voice
can i suggest you remove the sticker from the back of your car
margaret looks through the net curtains and sees carol thatcher early s just visible stepping out of a taxi remonstrating with the driver clutching her purse and waving her credit
card at him with rising irritation
well then take the sticker off
i call that false advertising
i would say keep the change but there isnt any change
a scotch being poured
the cap not quite going back on the whisky bottle
a frantic fumble for the remotes for the tv
hello june any news
ive brought every bag i could find
high shot of margaret sitting in a chair watching tv
as if she has been there a while
carol enters with suit carriers in her arms
bloody taxi driver
wouldnt take my card
i said dont have a sticker saying you take visa and then insist on cash
can you believe it
i was rummaging around the bottom of my bag
he didnt get a tip
i didnt know that you were dropping by today dear
dumping her stuff all over the place yes you said yesterday
you wanted to make a start on dads things
then i can help you dress
youve got michael and jaqueline
coming for dinner tonight
turning up the tv were having halibut
on tv images of a bombed street oh god
isnt it terrible
margaret nods both silently listening to the drone of the newscaster they think its al quaida the charred remains of cars desperate people running a rescue operation midway margaret blinks
inwardly reeling from the images denis
quick flash denis in pyjamas brushing his teeth in a hotel bathroom glances at her through the open door
itll be fine
come on get your head down its ten to three for gods sake
chaos outside the grand hotel in the aftermath of the bomb
the injured are pulled through the rubble
at ten to three this morning an explosion extensively damaged the grand hotel in brighton scene of the conservative party conference
where the prime minister and a number of her cabinet were staying
they escaped unhurt the whir of sirens the blur of fire engine lights the image of a body being stretchered out of the rubble by firefighters
five people have died many others are injured some critically
the ira have claimed responsibility
denis and margaret sit in their coats covering margarets evening dress and denis pyjamas
both looking out in silent shock at the devastated grand hotel reflected on the glass of the car windows
margaret looks on with quiet sobering despair still numb with shock
denis looks at her
he grips her hand
they sit fingers locked
close on margarets hand and whisky glass
standing up we must release a statement offering our condolences
im sure theyve already we must never ever ever give in to terrorists
margaret sees june and carol exchange looks of oh dear
margaret sits in a dressing gown at a dressing table staring at her reflection
carol stands behind her holding up several dresses
now ma are we going long or just below the knee tonight
oh below the knee i should think
she watches irritated as carol reaches to move a pile of denis clothes no
dont move those
i havent finished sorting them
carol settles beside her on a chair
i hear you went out today
you mustnt go out on your own mummy
weve talked about that
there was no milk
call robert hell get it for you if junes not up i am not for the knackers yet
from behind now take it easy margaret
denis just visible perched on the bed looks up from doing the crossword in the newspaper no one is saying that
if i cant go out to buy a pint of milk then what is the world coming to
really carol please dont fuss about it
youve always been like this fuss fuss fuss
you must find something better to do with your time
its most unattractive in a woman
when i was your age the last thing i wanted to do was fuss around my mother
silence carol inwardly stung quietly busying herself forcing all emotion away
margaret hesitates catching denis eye with quiet warning
four down letters
denis withdraws into his crossword
something b something t something n
something something somthing
refusal to change course obstinate
denis writes pleased
carol looks up with quiet bemusement what
margaret deflects pointing to a necklace in carols hands
ill wear the pearls
carol slips them onto margarets neck and fastens them
there they are
my little twins
thank you dear
the murmur of conversation carol tails margaret steady on the approach towards the drawing room
its nearly all familiar faces william michael and his lovely wife jacqueline
carol smiles clearly reassured and then theres peter james r and james t and that very nice man yes we met last year
yes i remember i think hes bringing his new lady friend just to mix it up a bit
were rather short on women but im sure well manage ive always preferred the company of men carol gestures ahead margaret nods reticent yet forcing herself on she hesitates at
the door her hand trembling on the handle
close up of a shoe being rubbed on a calf
a young hand hesitating on a door handle
a s drinks party a bank of stuffy grey suited men pontificating and their wives lost in a separate polite conversation ah miss roberts
hoping to be chosen as our candidate for parliament
a young margaret yrs stylish in a suit straight from work stands clutching her handbag oddly out of place amidst the neat s chintz
a bank of sporting prints collage a wall
a bespectacled young denis thatcher s glances up from his drink taking her in
the murmur of dinner party conversation well i dont like coalitions never have
margarets pov of her fingers absently grazing a confusing array of cutlery laid out in place setting in front of her
her confused face
start on the outside
and work your way in
a long table packed with silverware
she looks back at her ornate and rather hideous starter a tiny wobbling savoury confection in aspic
attlee has his sights set on the steel industry you mark my words
theyll be nationalizing the bloody air next
yes hold your breath sir thats government property
so was your father a political man too miss roberts
oh yes to his core
and mayor of grantham
and a grocer as well
ears prick up around the table
the host is lost for something to say
and did you help err in the
it was a family business
a very good starting point for the political life im sure
that and a degree from oxford
the put down though not intentional causes denis to smile
margaret catches the smile
she remains unruffled and goes back to her food picking up a knife and fork working her way in teasing her hors doeuvres
margaret sits oddly removed hand instinctively covering her wine glass as a wine waiter hovers
hushed aside to whisky
the murmur of conversation all around pudding is on the go and margaret is warming to her theme
what i do think is that a man should be encouraged to stand on his own two feet
yes we help people of course we help people
but for those that can do they must just get up and do
and if somethings wrong they shouldnt just whine about it they should get in there and do something about it change things
the female guests exchange glances
a half chuckle from someone
with all due respect miss roberts what may have served in grantham can serve very well for the people of dartford too
a general sense of quiet incredulity
i know much more than those who have never lived on a limited income
just like the man or woman on the street when i am short one week i have to make economies the next
nothing like a slice of fiscal responsibility
a man might call it fiscal responsibility a woman might call it good housekeeping
im not sure a home economics lesson is quite what the dartford constituents need
they see industry being nationalized the unions on the up the pound on the slide
whoever can sort that lot out hes my man
denis lets out a spontaneous guffaw as the host and hostess exchange looks
he signals get them out of here
the men rise
ladies shall we
miss roberts do join the ladies
the ladies scurry to the sitting room
margaret is the last to leave
as margaret closes the door to the dining room well
thats told us
the men laugh raucously
she turns to the ladies who are regrouping at the fireplace and regarding her with suspicion
the aftermath of the muted dinner party margaret at the helm a small whisky just visible nestled next to her wine glass
she is flushed and nicely mellow surrounded by mainly male guests so margaret how would you have dealt with this if youd been prime minister
margaret looks at him her flicker of bemusement
slowly registering across the faces of her friends and colleagues including carol
the bombings mummy
margaret still lost we were just talking about them
margaret deflects reaching for her glass it trembles unsteady in her grasp
no uhm yes we have always lived alongside evil
but it has never been so patient so avid for carnage so eager to carry innocents with it into oblivion
so would you western civilization must root out this evil wherever it hides or she risks defeat at the hands of global terror in a nuclear age
appreciative murmur of agreements amongst the listening party the prime minister gave a very good statement i thought
quite a smoothie
laughter margaret says final farewells to a guest
he walks away as another couple approach
you dont mind if i sit down
sitting down on a nearby chair margaret looks with feigned recollection at the female guest as she sinks down on the ground in front of her gripping margarets hand
i heard you speak at conference in in brighton just after the ira bombed the grand hotel
you were remarkable
i hope you appreciate what an inspiration you have been for women like myself
margaret hesitates smiles nods to herself considering it used to be about trying to do something
now its about trying to be someone
the female guest nods and scrambled to her feet clearly concerned shooting a look to her husband standing beside her waiting to depart
well anyway i
good night to you
margaret sits alone
in the background the chatter of carol saying final farewells
great to see you thank you very much for coming
oh thank you
it was lovely absolutely lovely
and im so pleased to see your mother looking so well
a mirror lined dressing room carol helps margaret with her shoes
hold on to me
margaret struggles with the catch on her pearls can you do the clasp i cant quite carol hurries to help her margaret quietly concedes
fingers fumble to unclasp the pearls thank you
carol drops the pearls into a jewelry box close to margaret staring back at their reflections
youve got an eyelash
carol catches the stray eyelash on the tip of her finger holding it close to margaret with a smile make a wish
margaret closes her eyes until margaret blows
she opens them smiles
i spoke to doctor michael today margaret glances away deflecting
he is very good and very expensive margaret ignores her i know youre not due to see him for another month but ive spoken to him and he can fit
you in tomorrow
just for a check up
silence ma please what does mark think about it
tell him to come up
i want to talk to him about it
carol hesitates with concern marks with sarah and the children
margaret nods heading through into the bathroom
well tell him to come up and see me after hes kissed them good night would you carol darling
margaret sitting on her bed glances expectantly towards the door
carol sits down beside her
hes not here mummy
margaret hesitates carol using all her might not to crumble under margarets cool gaze mark lives in south africa
margaret inwardly flinches
you are not prime minister anymore and dad is
dad is dead silence you look exhausted dear
you really must try to get some sleep
taxisll be few and far between at this hour
night night ma
good night dear
the slam of a door
margaret sits alone
margarets pov of denis turning to her in the theatre
margarets fingers absently grazing over the programme in time with the music suddenly a closed fist reaches out then opens to reveal a sugar mouse
margarets fingers reach for it but its teasingly withdrawn
finally she takes its
she turns to smile at denis her face is glowing with happiness margaret sits on the edge of a trestle table scrunching a rosette in her hand
the town hall is empty save for a couple of volunteers stacking chairs and sweeping the floor
the litter of election night is everywhere
twenty four year old miss margaret roberts lost her bid to win a seat in parliament today but she has put new life into the dartford conservative association
winning candidate mr dodds had better watch out this bright young woman is on his tail
denis appears in the doorway carrying fish and chips
he slides them down in front of her
margaret almost smiles
then sinks once more into misery
denis fishes in his pocket pulling out a hip flask
an impromptu supper made
margaret takes in the aftermath of rosettes the whiff of defeat all around
you shaved thousands off their majority
you did splendidly
not splendidly enough
ah i see
margaret eyes him mid chip no one is saying you dont need a safe seat
you deserve a safe seat
but it does not come unless you learn to play the game a little
she is fuming but he regroups with a big breath
you are a grocers daughter fiercely and proud of being he grabs her hand silencing her
in their eyes
a single grocers daughter
but if you were to become the wife of a moderately successful businessman for the first time we see margaret taken by surprise
youd get to parliament and id get to be the happiest man in in wherever they select you
margaret will you marry me
she is genuinely stunned
she is frozen
then she begins to smile and nod her head and smile
he leans over and kisses her long and passionately until what
i love you so much but
i will never be one of those women denis who stays silent and pretty on the arm of her husband
or remote and alone in the kitchen doing the washing up for that matter
trying to retain the moment well get a help for that
he leans forward to kiss her again but she pulls away a little
no ones life must matter denis
beyond the cooking and the cleaning and the children ones life must mean more than that i cannot die washing up a tea cup
he sits up and stares as if seeing her for the first time
i mean it denis say you understand
thats why i want to marry you my dear
she kisses him
a chink of a teacup they pull apart
flushed and giggling on seeing a lone woman enters the hall cleaning up the last of the tea cups and generally tidying
margaret smiles her joy at him as shall we dance swells
and now shes in his arms as they dance swirling through the election debris eyes only for each other
margaret now on all fours struggling with her glasses
a pile of dvds on the floor the king and i amongst them momentarily catching her eye until a dvd with hand written scrawl that we cant quite read
margaret flicks open the box struggling to get the dvd out
fiddling with the dvd player margaret puts in the disc and considers squinting at the remote trying to make the dvd player work until suddenly
super footage children on a beach in wind swept grainy super
denis with a golf club and ping pong balls practicing his drive from a tee sending ball after ball skying into the sea
mark and carol charge into the water to retrieve them
there they are my little twins
denis approaches the camera laughing and appears to take hold of it
margaret is seen sitting on a wobbly camping stool hardly dressed for the beach surrounded by papers weighed held down by pebbles
she merrily returns to her work
cornwall wasnt it
look at em little imps
you never really got golf did you
denis sits behind her on the sofa in a dressing gown watching the footage
she sips her whisky
you look happy
yes i do dont i
youre drinking too much
margaret ignores him
denis looks at margaret unwavering
she resumes a search not like you
margaret suddenly presses rewind on the remote clutched in her hand
dont want to dig around too deep m
dont know what you might find
the rapid rewind of denis swinging his golf club
you can rewind it but you cant change it
she freezes the image of him turning to camera laughing
they grow up so fast
margaret turns with something to say but denis doesnt seem to be there anymore
now on the screen mark on a swing
margarets face softens
he turns and rushes towards the camera whooshing past it
without breaking step suddenly hes in the room running past margaret still cheering and whooping
margarets hand just skimming marks golden curls
as he moves on margarets curiosity caught following him out and down the corridor of chester square seeing the mark and carol disappear round a corner
the view beyond mr eric deakins labour
the crunch of gravel as carol and mark race across the drive towards a blue ford car covered with tory blue streamers and a vote for thatcher poster scrawled with
the words victory
margaret now on all fours struggling with her glasses
a pile of dvds on the floor the king and i amongst them momentarily catching her eye until a dvd with hand written scrawl that we cant quite read
margaret flicks open the box struggling to get the dvd out
fiddling with the dvd player margaret puts in the disc and considers squinting at the remote trying to make the dvd player work until suddenly
super footage children on a beach in wind swept grainy super
denis with a golf club and ping pong balls practicing his drive from a tee sending ball after ball skying into the sea
mark and carol charge into the water to retrieve them
there they are my little twins
denis approaches the camera laughing and appears to take hold of it
margaret is seen sitting on a wobbly camping stool hardly dressed for the beach surrounded by papers weighed held down by pebbles
she merrily returns to her work
cornwall wasnt it
look at em little imps
you never really got golf did you
denis sits behind her on the sofa in a dressing gown watching the footage
she sips her whisky
you look happy
yes i do dont i
youre drinking too much
margaret ignores him
denis looks at margaret unwavering
she resumes a search margaret fingers brush dark panelled walls making her way along endless corridors
gothic arches venerable busts wood panelling and stone
margarets pov as she stays to the side of the impressive corridor
she passes men in suits and groups
others come towards her and notice her
her pov as she pushes open a first door tea room a circle of men turn round in chorus as if something with three heads has appeared
pov of a second opening door marked members
a row of urinals
two headless bodies come towards the camera scrambling to zip up their flies
pov of the promise of sanctuary
the door opens onto a cupboard sized space
an ironing board
a sea of mens oxford shoes from ground level
a pair of womans shoes appear amongst them
they go on tip toe
from above we see margarets hat amongst the sea of mens heads and shoulders
margaret is carried along in the sea of male mps oxford shoes
airey neave extremely dapper friendly approaches mrs thatcher
welcome to the madhouse
the doors swing open margaret now secretary of state for education on the front bench wearing a neat blue suit and a hat a phalanx of ministers sitting beside and
around her blue and grey suited men almost at first glance indistinguishable with prime minister edward heath late s neat effete slumped rather forlornly on the bench
margaret her speech and papers in her hand is fighting hard but the opposition labour benches scent blood and they literally bray getting to their feet and shaking their order
papers in her face
the speaker tries to control the chamber but his voice is almost lost in the bedlam
the right honourable lady the secretary of state for education
the right honourable gentleman knows that we have no choice but to shut down the schools
cries of shame
from the opposition
the chamber reduced to a bear pit
heath glum and offering no help to margaret whose voice becomes increasingly shrill
because his union paymasters have called a strike deliberately to cripple our economy
teachers cannot teach when there is no heating no lighting in their classrooms
and i ask the honourable gentleman whose fault is that
methinks the right honourable lady doth screech to much
if she wants us to take her seriously she must learn to calm down
the opposition benches love that rocking in their seats laughing
falsely of course
but margaret is aware that there are many men behind her on the government benches who are also sniggering in agreement
if the right honorable gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to what i am saying rather than how i am saying it he may receive a valuable education in spite
her opposite number shadow minister looks almost smug smiling pointing a finger at her
why has this conservative government failed
why has it forced so many in the public sector into taking strike action to save their own jobs
it brings the opposition benches to their feet shouting applauding stamping
margaret walking with airey neave towards downing street for a cabinet meeting
all around heaped high on either side as far as the eye can see are bags of rubbish
but not neatly stacked just thrown there many of them rotting down spilling their filthy putrid contents onto the street
minister the breakdown of essential public services transport electricity sanitation is not the fault of the trades unions but of this conservative government in which you so shamefully serve
the stench is awful and margarets expression reflects that as she picks her way through
the ranks of bespectacled grey suited ministers at the cabinet table including geoffrey howe
so these power cuts will continue unless we can reach a compromise
edward heath is in mid flow
the miners are asking for a increase in wages
obviously we cant go anywhere near that
the unions are not our enemies and never have been
we want and have always wanted the broadest consensus
the ministers nod
margaret determinedly edges a little forward so that she is in equal line with the other male im sure we are all in agreement that we must do nothing for
the moment that will further inflame the current situation
hear hear prime minister
margaret leans forward for a better view trying to catch his eye
heath wavers mid speech
all turn to look at margaret who sits unwavering
the fact of the matter is its absolutely crucial that we are seen by the public to be acting as conciliators and not aggressors
finally acknowledging margaret yes education secretary
all eyes turn on her again hearing the reservation in her voice
prime minister with the miners leader calling today for the army to mutiny in support of the strikes this seems the wrong time for conciliation
a lot of bloody hell oh for gods sake
theyll come back on in a minute
a beam of light cuts through just for an instant picking out heaths moon like face surrounded by darkness
margaret holds the small torch
thank you margaret
a snigger then the lights flicker back on
your thoughts are duly noted
margaret turns of the torch and clicks her handbag shut in satisfaction
heaths words echo in her head compromise
an inward look as shes caught by a memory
we on this island are strong
were self reliant
napoleon called us a nation of shopkeepers
the packed town hall alfred roberts in full flow on stage
he meant it as an insult but to me its a compliment
thats why he couldnt beat us and thats why hitler cant beat us
the crowd of men applaud
the lone woman in their midst young margaret watches her father face aglow
we conservatives believe in giving people the freedom and opportunity to fulfil their own potential especially the young
theres no good in pretending were all equal were not all the same never have been never will be
we should encourage our children to aspire to achieve more than we have for our children today will be the leaders of tomorrow
carol and margaret seated driving steadily along a deserted street
margaret thoughtful as the radio plays
its and youd think it was wwii
blackouts no petrol
its a mess
heath should resign now and make way for someone whos not afraid to tackle the unions
carols nervous prattle begins to break through
i swear its all gone completely out of my head
my driving instructor thinks i should pass but i feel as if ive hardly had any lessons
ridiculous isnt it
maybe third time lucky
the only thing you should remember is that everyone else is either reckless or inept
and often both
margaret eyes the road gesturing carol to move forward
one must be brave if one is to take the wheel right o
move to your right a little bit
but if i move to the right arent i on the wrong side of the road
well hes in the way
to the right
move to the right
a yelp from carol as the car swerves a little narrowly missing a lone cyclist so sorry
margaret throws a wave from the wound down window
the cyclist swerves on recognizing her watching as the car goes round and round the square almost balletic
hey look at me driving
carols squeals of delight let loose on the open road
the tyres screech on the corner
laughter voices on the approach thanks ma that was terrific
i really feel ive got a handle on it now
carol and margaret entering kitchen still giddy from their adventure
you should have seen us pa
denis in his dressing gown burning toast and attempting to make breakfast have you been trying to make breakfast
for goodness sake denis
denis scrapes down the toast eggs boiling in the pan
i can boil a bloody egg
mummy took me for a test drive we went absolutely everywhere
all over the place sudden cutting in ive decided
im going to run
margaret smiles a growing resolution gripping her
im going to run for leader of the party
carols utter disappointment on seeing she has lost margaret already
carol storms out of the kitchen
calling after good luck
all the time i thought i was having a driving lesson it was all about my mother just for a change
whats she on about
its her driving test this morning
are you saying you want to be prime minister
with false patience what im saying is that someone must force the point say the unsayable
none of these men have the guts
margaret sees the burnt toast and energetically starts clearing up and putting more bread under the grill
the prime minister has been very loyal to you mt
he tries with a trembling hand to scoop boiled eggs from the pan
but hes weak and hes weakened the party
one must know when to go
glancing at him youre shaking
she reaches out
i can do it
denis pulls his arm away sending boiled eggs flying
what is the matter with everyone this morning
he looks utterly fragile
ive told you what the matter is
the business is a bit rocky at the moment and the doctor thinks i need a rest
and do you need a rest
its almost challenging
he doesnt answer and she doesnt notice
we both know that its highly unlikely that i would ever be elected leader ill never be elected leader
but i will run
i will run
just to nip at their heels and make them reaffirm the principles on which the conservative party must stand
theres so much to do
sotto voce youre insufferable margaret do you know that
denis you married someone who is committed to public service you knew that
and it is my duty interrupts dont call it duty
its ambition which has got you this far
and the rest of us me the children we can all go to hell
the slam of the door denis gone dont worry about me ill be fine
margaret and denis sit on the sofa
where did you go
margaret eats breakfast alone engrossed in the newspaper
how many days passed before you realized i was gone
probably had to ask the cleaning woman where i was
margaret grips her whiskey shaking her head
when did i lose track of everyone
too busy climbing the greasy pole cutting in mrs thatcher i understand you recently visited the united states of america
margarets attention is caught by an old interview playing on the tv
she leans forward
on screen she sits in a neat hat leaning forward eagerly
what was it you took away from that visit which may be of value here in great britain
margaret perched on a chair smiling at the tv oh thats rather easy to answer actually
they are unafraid of success
margaret is watching the same interview on a tv monitor
she is watching herself intently as are reece and airey neave
they are polar opposites reece flamboyant to neaves bluff
she sounds very plummy like a conservative party wife from the shires
and she wears a hat
we in great britain and in europe are formed mainly by our history
they on the other hand are formed by their philosophy
not by what has been but by what can be
oh we have a great deal that we can learn from them yes
margaret is trapped in the moment but the two men exchange a glance
neave freezes the picture
margaret smiles uneasily like someone expecting a compliment
reece considers her long and hard
it is a little unsettling until well er
for a start that hat has got to go
and the pearls
in fact i think all hats may have to go
you look and sound like a privileged conservative wife and weve already got her vote
youve got lovely hair but we need to do something with it to make it more important
give it more impact
but the main thing is your voice
its too high
it has no authority
methinks the lady doth screech too much people dont want to be harangued by a woman or hectored
that oh yes at the end of the interview thats authoritative thats the voice of a leader
margaret stares at him
its all very well to talk about changing my voice mr reece but for some of my colleagues to imagine me as their leader would be like imagining i dont
know being led into battle by their chambermaid
its my background and my sex
no matter how ive tried and i have tried to fit in i will never be truly one of them
both reece and neave are aware that she has spoken very nakedly and is thus extremely vulnerable
if i may say so i think thats your trump card
youre flying in the face of everything the tories have been thus far
its really very exciting
one simply has to maximise your appeal bring out all your qualities and make you look and sound like the leader that you could be
youve got it in you to go the whole distance
oh no no no
there will be no female prime minister here not in my lifetime
and i told airey i dont expect to win the leadership but i am going to run
just to shake up the party
neave moves in intently respectfully margaret i disagree
if you want to change this party lead it
if you want to change the country lead it
what were talking about here today is surface
whats crucial is that you hold your course and stay true to who you are
never be anything other than yourself
margaret though flattered looks sceptical
leave us to do the rest
gentlemen i am in your hands
i may be persuaded to surrender the hat
but the pearls were a gift from my husband on the birth of our twins and they are absolutely non negotiable
margaret smiles at them
margaret stands humming a theatrical coach presses her hand to margarets stomach
bring it down
margaret hums lower tries to project her voice
good i think we can loose the handbag mrs thatcher
hands down the sides
because this isnt really about the voice its about belief
a nice deep breath
reece and neave are watching and monitoring the performance
denis though present is having a crafty fag by the window
if youre calling mr thatcher how would you do that
margaret looks over at him
he doesnt react
yes i want more authority i want conviction i want a little more authority denis
thats right one more time deep breath she puts on her new lower voice
and denis reacts immediately like a guilty thing surprised stabbing out his cigarette turning quickly towards her
margaret makes her way through a crowd of applauding workers in crisp white uniforms
like them she wears a white cap on her head
you are the backbone of our nation
small firms like lovedays ice cream
how are you
so nice to meet you ladies
general merriment as margaret now inside an ice cream van has a go at dispensing an ice cream from the machine
ill just have a small one because im watching my figure
handing the cone out thats for you young man
margaret is having new hair colour and the colourist is percent through putting her hair in foil
i passionately believe its the growth of small businesses into larger ones that is critical for britains future
reece and neave are sitting nearby both of them reading the financial times
margaret among the ladies again
it has to be something icy on a stick for denis
returning to her subject thats the only way we will produce jobs real jobs jobs that sustain
margaret sitting under the dryer cooking her new hair still correcting paperwork while reece and neave look on twiddling their thumbs
margaret is standing on an impromptu stage outside a factory
she has a hard hat on her head
the trade union movement was founded to protect workers
now it persecutes them
it stops them from working
it is killing jobs and it is bringing this country to its knees
i say enough
its time to get up
its time to go to work
its time to put the great back into great britain
the bouffant is now apparent
reece and neave watch in awe
a darkened backstage
margaret clutching her speech goes over her lines
a female aide sprays her hair
she looks up starts to move towards the light
airey neave is suddenly next to her
give em hell
he looks her up and down with a smile
you look magnificent
next stop prime minister
as from the stage the leader of the conservative party margaret thatcher
margaret pushes back her shoulders and walks into battle to the sound of growing applause
britain needs the conservatives bannered overhead and hung with union jacks
margaret a swathe of blue as she passes through her grey suited cabinet
from behind she stands arms outstretched accepting the applause a shock of bright blonde hair as she stands before a sea of conservative delegates holding up letter cards we love
wedges of fanatical party faithful on their feet in a kind of rapture
the blessed margaret
denis just visible with reece howe pym heseltine and several other grey suited ministers of her cabinet seated close behind now jumping to their feet with obvious relief and delight
margaret smiles glorious catching denis eye
he is brimming with pride
airey neave beams at his protegee
close on a photograph of margaret and airey neave
margaret sits looking at it her coat on her handbag on her lap
margaret is loading papers and files into the boot of her car
airey neave drives towards her winding down his window
good night margaret
my moneys on the filly to win
oh thanks airey
he laughs and drives towards the exit of the car park
as margaret closes the boot and opens the door to get in the car suddenly theres a massive explosion the sound magnified by being in the cavernous underground
for a few seconds we dont know whats happened
through the smoke we see margaret running up the ramp towards us
her pov of the fireball of neaves car
as margaret looks in horror at the scene
her shattered face
the irish national liberation army has claimed responsibility for the death of airey neave margaret thatchers spokesman on northern ireland
margaret on the conference podium blinking back tears
behind her denis face etched with the same sorrow
margaret walks alone down the grand stairway sombre deep in thought
margaret looks up from the photograph tears in her eyes
if you want to change the party lead it
if you want to change the country lead it
youve got it in you to go the whole distance
on margaret as memories flood in
a tv headline announces election
margaret on the podium
now as the test draws near i ask your help
that together we can shake off the shackles of socialism and restore to greatness this country that we love so much
and the only way is for the conservative party to win
the black streak of margarets car a blur of colour faces waving flags tv footage of polling night
swingometers pollsters impressionistic snatches of reported speech
more footage of people coming out of polling stations
jubilant crowds applauding
margaret silhouetted in her iconic stance arms aloft
margaret peering out of the window hands sunk in the lap a flash of the royal blue fabric of her skirt clenched in fingers
its friday the th of may an historic day for britain a conservative government led by mrs
thatcher is set to lead mrs ghandi in india but never in the west has there been a woman prime minister
the place that she has secured in british history as the first woman ever to be invited to form a government
the bonus of one of the most famous addresses in the world number downing street
banners read we love you maggie blur through the window an abstract cacophony of noise and colour this is it steady the buffs old girl
he clasps her hand for a moment as margaret smiles at him
the door swings open the camera from behind on margaret rising up out of the car to face a waiting press corp
the jostle of a police officer denis and others press her either side i should just like to say that i take very seriously the trust the british people placed
in me today and i will work hard every day to live up to that responsibility
and now i should like to share with you a prayer of st francis of assisi where there is discord may we bring harmony
where there is error may we bring truth
where there is doubt may we bring faith
where there is despair may we bring hope
the camera rises up high above margaret until she is just a blue dot on the dark tarmac a lone woman standing facing the circle of cameras and microphones
the door of number looms ahead
the cheers go over
the cabinet gathering for a group shot shoulders back tummies in
michael heseltine standing behind margaret reaches out to smooth a stray lock of her hair
thank you michael
margaret seated at the heart of her entire cabinet as if she is royalty
the flash of the camera the image frozen
the same image framed on a side table beside margaret
the distant hum of a hoover
im perfectly healthy
theres no need for any of this
denis appears his hand inside his shoe polishing it vigorously
just let them look under the bonnet mt
check everything is hunky dory
she sits in silence until really its becoming quite tiresome
beat i was on my own for twenty four years before i met you and i can manage perfectly well without you now
so will you please go away and stop bothering me
a distinguished consulting room margaret sits silent as an eminent doctor checks her blood pressure
the beep of the machine steady and monotonous until just look straight at me straight ahead thats it
the doctor scribbles some notes considering are you noticing night sweats
she shakes her head
yes i sleep
four five hours a night
so you wake early
and i stay up late
i always have
she looks at him as if he really should know this about her
the doctor notes this down
we just want to keep abreast of it
grief is a very natural state
my husband has been gone for years
carol says youve decided to let his things go
probably a good thing
it was my idea
perfectly good stuff
people can use these things
still it must be a bit disorientating
you are bound to be feeling
what am i bound to be feeling
the doctor looks up from his note taking hearing the quiet challenge in margarets voice
people dont think any more
how are you feeling
oh i dont feel comfortable with that oh im so sorry but we the group were feeling
dyou know one of the great problems of our age is that we are governed by people who care more about feelings than thoughts and ideas
beat now thoughts and ideas
that interests me
beat ask me what i am thinking the doctor hesitates letting margaret settle until what are you thinking margaret
margaret looks at the doctor quietly struggling with a fury threatening to unleash watch your thoughts for they become words
watch your words for they become actions
watch your actions for they become habits
watch your habits for they become your character
and watch your character for it becomes your destiny
what we think we become
my father always said that
beat and i think i am fine
beat but i do so appreciate your kind concern
the sudden and persistent buzz of an intercom oh do please answer that
margaret holds his gaze with quiet unwavering steel unsettling the doctor a little
it might be someone who needs you
the doctor reluctantly answers his intercom june heads up the stairs margaret following behind
ill give carol a quick ring let her know were back then ill put your electric blanket on
looking through the bannisters her eyes fall on a golf ball running along the floor
margaret considers looks up steady steady steady
the ball bounces down the wooden stairs
margaret opens the fridge
a cold plated lunch resting on a shelf
what about that medicine man eh
standards are slipping margaret
margaret ignores denis taking out the plate unwrapping the cellophane off it and placing it on a table already laid ready for her to eat
well you really gave it to that quack didnt you darling
just like the old days
hallucinations my eye
denis picks up a piece of cucumber from her plate
she absently smacks at his hand
how dare he
but then you give us all the run around dont you
margaret looks at him silently infuriated
margaret pours herself a whiskey
denis looms close serves a splash of soda
i know you can hear me sweetheart so theres no use pretending you cant
margaret turns ignoring him
margaret sits reading denis spy novel
she does it in the end
kills him margaret slams the book closed
i dont know why youre being so scratchy
margarets eyes dart to the clock
its not as if youve got anyone else to talk to
shaking her head margaret tries to block him out
when the himalayan peasant meets the he bear in his pride you know its a marvel to me that you can still quote huge chunks of kipling but try remembering
the name of that woman whos just made you that godawful cold collation
you can do it
month of the year
rhymes with moon sudden like a lightbulb june
margaret turns to denis a quiet appalling victory
knew youd get there in the end
when the himalayan peasant meets the he bear in his pride he shouts to scare the monster who will often turn aside but the she bear thus accosted rends the
peasant tooth and nail
for the female of the species is more deadly than the male
as he continues margaret reaches for the remote turns the television on
she moves onto the radio
then the stereo
she moves on talking to herself a gradual growing cacophony of sound margaret flicks on mixers radios toasters the noise almost unbearable now margaret turns on a hi fi the
tv now on if i cant hear you then i cant see you
and if i cant see you then you are not here
margaret closes her eyes
and if you are not here i am not going mad
i will not
i will not go mad
she opens them and suddenly freezes on seeing an image of herself bewildered and leaving harley street caught on the tv baroness thatcher made an apparently routine visit to her
although rarely seen in public lady thatcher the longest serving prime minister of the twentieth century remains a controversial figure
margaret turns up the volume to full trying to hear over the cacophony of noise the changing images on the tv illuminating her pale face
margaret margaret barely sees her eyes riveted to the tv
almost lovingly dubbed by the soviets the iron lady shes also credited with her friend ronald reagan with a decisive role in the ending of the cold war
her supporters claim she transformed the british economy and reversed the countrys post war decline
her detractors blame her savage public spending cuts and sweeping privatization of june moves like a dervish through the house muting the television and turning off the last of the
appliances a gradual silence descends until margaret takes in the image of herself on the mute screen standing bewildered on the steps of harley street
almost to self i dont recognize myself
the shelf of a bathroom cabinet
margaret begins to pull them all off the shelves
am i out of the doghouse yet
then a pair of glasses
more gently margarets hand reaches into the cupboard and takes the glasses in her hand
margaret lies in bed book in her lap denis beside her reading the paper
she closes the book and pulls off her reading glasses
theyre unveiling that portrait of me at number next month
the invitations on the mantelpiece
so therell be churchill lloyd george and me
just the three of us
i said i didnt want any big fuss but they insisted
lovely little article in the telegraph
the woman who changed the face of history
voices from the past intrude less than two years ago the prime minister quoted st
francis and talked about bringing faith hope and harmony to this country
margaret suddenly reaches out a hand her hand shaking denis
she turns in bed
sudden panic denis is gone a heckling chamber as margaret sits facing labour outrage the labour leader foot grips his paper mid speech can the right honourable lady deny that
having brought about the highest level of unemployment since margaret bides her time on the front bench waiting her turn surrounded by her cabinet ministers including howe pym and heseltine the biggest fall in total output in steel and coal production in one year since
and the biggest collapse in industrial production since
margaret remains seemingly calm and serene and yet one hand quietly grips the bench her wedding ring tapping against the wood nervously
can she also accept that her free market economics designed to create a growing middle class ensures that the rich get richer and the poor are irrelevant
a rising roar of voices maggie maggie maggie
out out out
maggie maggie maggie
out out out
margaret in her car driving through the blur of furious youre supposed to be a mother
youre not a mother youre s monster
youre a monster
close up on a button the steady in and out of a needle pulling taut on a thread
margaret stands swathed in a glittering long dinner dress a seamstress stitching a stray button on the front of the bodice on her dress
geoffrey howe stands nearby in a dinner jacket
may we have a word prime minister
a bank of ministers including heseltine pym prior howe and gilmour gather before her
yes but in order to arrive at the palace on time geoffrey and i are will be walking out of that door in minutes
as you can see i know youre running late margaret but we have to address this situation in light of tomorrows blistering press coverage
the knives are out
your draft budgets been leaked geoffrey they are baying for our blood
michael we cant possibly buckle at the first sign of difficulty
the scratch of priors hand on unkempt hair no one is saying we have to buckle
but is this really the time to make these spending cuts in the middle of one of the deepest recessions this country has ever experienced
we need a plan of action margaret
we must be armed
margaret stiffens the needle momentarily hovering mid stitch as margaret shifts a little the seamstress resumes sewing theres a perception margaret rightly or wrongly that we are now completely out
of touch with the country
the patronizing tone inflames her
beat how much is a pack of lurpak
silence forty two pence
anchor butter is forty pence
flora margarine still the cheapest is thirty eight pence
i can assure you i am not out of touch
another minister gilmour whispers the words grocers daughter as a put down
the men smirk
margaret has caught the moment
a sudden flash of the pretty girls in the grantham street long ago laughing at her
what did you say
gilmour makes a gesture
nothing prime minister
margaret is furious
dont try to hide you opinions
goodness me id much rather you were honest and straightforward about them instead of continuously and damagingly leaking them to the press
margarets eyes travel around the room in waiting well people cant pay their mortgages
the manufacturing industry is practically on its knees
honest hard working decent people are losing their homes
its terribly shameful
the point is prime minister that we must moderate the pace if were even to have a hope of winning the next election quite right
worried about our careers are we
they make noises to the effect that nothing could be further from the truth
but margaret has their measure
gentlemen if we dont cut spending we will be bankrupt
yes the medicine is harsh but the patient requires it in order to live
shall we withhold the medicine
we are not wrong
we did not seek election and win in order to manage the decline of a great nation
the people of this country chose us because they believe we can restore the health of the british economy and we will do just that
barring a failure of nerve
the snap of cotton margaret looks at them in a cold fury
margaret nods to the seamstress dismissing her thank you
you saved the day once again crawfie youre an angel
margaret straightens her cuff testing the button as the meeting slowly disbands and the ministers move away
you cant close down a discussion because its not what you wish to hear
i dont expect everyone just to sit there and agree with me
but what kind of leader am i if i dont try to get my own way to do what i know to be right
but margaret one must be careful of testing ones colleagues loyalty too far
margaret glances up watching the ministers disappearing in whispered conversation like conspirators
archive footage rioting in brixton burning cars huge civil unrest we are now one split nation with a huge gulf dividing the employed from the unemployed
archive footage protest marches peoples march for jobs no pit closures the thatcher plan is to break the trade union movement
there must be closures of uneconomic coal mines we seek only an efficient industry
archive footage violent clashes between protesting miners and police the miners are being starved back to work the need is desperate
margaret sweeping along an endless corridor surrounded by her cabinet hard on her heels
howe heseltine pym prior and others
margaret talking they hang on her every word
there are those who would say hold back there are those who would make us retreat margaret mid speech
but we shall never give in to them
we shall never waver not for a second in our determination to see this country prosper once again
the party faithful erupt in cheers seconded by all margarets courtiers on the platform
pym prior heseltine howe and above all denis applauding as if their lives depended on it
margaret sits clutching the sink a light sweat breaking across her forehead
she looks up a car bomb has exploded outside harrods department store killing six people and injuring
eleven soldiers died today when two bombs were detonated during military parades in hyde park and regents park
seven horses also died in the blasts
intercut archive footage bombed buildings horses lying dead in the street an ira banner
the ira have claimed responsibility
margaret lost in restless sleep intercut archive footage ira graffiti scrawled on a wall paramilitaries fire guns sirens wail
margaret on the podium
and now it must be business as usual
denis in pyjamas brushes his teeth in the bathroom
he glances at margaret through the open door as she sits still in evening dress working on her speech
come on love get to bed
i dont know why you do this to yourself every year its a speech at conference not the magna carta
she looks up distracted
time to call it a day darling
its ten to three for gods sake
i know im coming dt
nearly there an almighty explosion rips through the room wood glass furniture splinters curtains flay from the walls
the fall of plaster devastating the hotel room obliterated reduced to a smoking dusty rubble
margaret stands ghostlike covered in debris
calling out denis
margaret searching through the haze of fallen plaster covered with dust slowly clearing to reveal more desperate denis there you are
are you alright
denis ghostlike covered in dust still in his pyjamas holding up an obliterated pair of shoes
beyond the wall of the bathroom entirely blown away the caw of gulls chaos outside the grand hotel in the aftermath of the bomb
the whir of sirens denis and margaret sit in their car looking out in silent shock at the devastated grand hotel reflected on the glass of the car windows
thats when i thought id lost you
margaret wakes with a start confused and fumbles for the telephone by her bed picking up phone mark
no im fine
im very well
margaret squints fingers fumbling for denis watch
and the children
margaret sits up oh
thats a pity
i was hoping to see you
no really darling
margaret suddenly relents a flicker of sudden and urgent need caught in her eyes beat mark
silence mark gone
margaret hangs up stares at i whistle a happy tune from the king and i just audible margaret stands in the doorway a jaunty i whistle a happy tune seeping
from the television
that was mark
not able to come
cutting in boys always going awol
well it costs him a great deal to fly everyone up here
there you go making excuses for him
now look where its got you
denis stands dressed in dinner jacket and bow tie as he reads the back of the king and i dvd
did you know yul brynner was a gypsy from vladivostok
he moved to paris when he was fourteen
he played the king of siam times on the london and broadway stages
what are you doing
turning round shaking a cocktail one likes to make an effort
youre dead denis
well if im dead
who are you talking to
shall we dance
he takes margaret in his arms
the music changes to shall we dance from the king and i as denis takes a confused margaret in his arms and begins an expansive waltz round the room
the room turns
young denis dancing with the young margaret
now its old denis dancing with old margaret again
denis loses his footing and margaret lurches towards the desk where her eyes fall on figurines of falklands soldiers
she stares hard
the falkland islands the british colony in the south atlantic has fallen
argentina claims its marines went ashore this morning as a spearhead to capture key targets including the capital port stanley
margaret sits composed staring up at a phalanx of military men and her ministers
gentlemen the argentinian junta which is a fascist gang has invaded our sovereign territory
this cannot be tolerated
may i make plain my negotiating position
i will not negotiate with criminals or thugs
the falkland islands belong to britain and i want them back
gentlemen i need you to tell me today if that is possible
just prime minister
we can have a task force ready to sail in forty eight hours
margaret is visibly stunned
forty eight hours
we have a very narrow weather window
we cant fight in winter down there
if we are going we have to go now
margaret at her desk
why were the islands left without any naval protection
in the last round of defence cuts we judged the risk of invasion to be small
and if you remember prime minister you agreed that we should reduce the naval presence in the area to an absolute minimum
margaret taps her fingers against the map with growing irritation
margaret sits alone
margaret is under attack
margaret the cost of sending men and a hundred ships twelve thousand miles almost to argentina will be absolutely crippling
i dont think we should be worrying about money at this point geoffrey
we cant afford to go to war
margaret sits alone
we have to go now
the government has now decided that a large task force will sail as soon as all preparations are complete
intercut archive footage the task force sets sail
margaret paces deep in thought
prime minister we do still have three weeks before our ships reach the islands
all were saying is that we shouldnt give up on trying to find a diplomatic solution
a tea trolley and an american entourage surge down a downing street corridor
secretary of state has arrived prime minister
haig and margaret sit facing each other flanked by senior ministers
so you are proposing to go to war over these islands
theyre thousands of miles away a handful of citizens politically and economically
insignificant if youll excuse me just like hawaii i imagine
when japan attacked pearl harbour
did america go cap in hand and ask tojo for a peaceful negotiation of terms
did she turn her back on her own citizens there because the islands were thousands of miles from mainland united states
no no no
we will stand on principle or we shall not stand at all
but margaret with all due respect when one has been to war
with all due respect sir i have done battle every single day of my life and many men have underestimated me before
this lot seem bound to do the same but they will rue the day
margaret turns to a tea trolley close by now shall i be mother
hague looks confused margaret lifting the teapot tea al how do you take your tea
black or white
naval men murmuring messages quietly to naval attaches
male lips to male ears something margaret has seen all her life
francis pym and john nott stand near margaret
intercut stock footage the naval fleet sails towards the falklands
a map of south georgia and the falkland islands
model boats sit on the water flags sit on the islands
margaret stares at the map
a whispered message to one of the attaches
he moves a model boat on the map a few inches leading a fleet of smaller model boats
the argentinian ship the general belgrano and her escorts are pursuing course degrees toward the argentinian mainland
we are tracking it with our submarine hms conqueror
he points to a model submarine at some distance from the argentinian boats
is this ship a threat
both of these ships are carrying exocet missiles prime minister
just yesterday they launched then aborted an attack inside the exclusion zone
there is a risk they could try it again
the belgrano is sailing directly away from the islands
can it really be regarded as a threat
shes been changing course continually
theres a strong possibility that theyre attempting a pincer movement on our carrier group
i advise that we engage them hit the belgrano as a warning to the others
send them all back to port
margaret turns to john nott and francis pym
itll play badly internationally
well be seen as aggressors
she stares at the map once more
one of the men supervising the map moves the model of the belgrano a fraction further north
this will be an escalation prime minister
she looks to leach
if there is to be an escalation its better that we start it
it is steaming away prime minister
everyone is staring at margaret
even the assistants bustling in the background have stopped and are listening
male faces turned to her
she herself seems caught in a pincer movement between the politicians and the servicemen
tv footage a flash of a torpedo cutting through the water
a thunderous explosion
flashes of television images striated and blurry the belgrano listing in the water
reports of the sinking read out by the mods announcer
margaret and the falklands figurine silhouetted against the dawn light
tv footage close now we see a man on fire burning
voices mixing in and out
hms sheffield a type destroyer was attacked and hit late this afternoon by an argentine missile
it is seen as a retaliation for the sinking of the general belgrano in which over argentinian sailors died
margarets eyes shining as if with tears
a soft knocking at the door
she dabs them away quickly
prime minister john nott enters
latest casualty figures from the sheffield
he hands her a piece of paper
sotto voce i must write to them
i must write to them
margaret at her desk looks up at pym
ive just been briefed by admiral fieldhouse
he told me bluntly that if the argentinians are prepared and willing to risk their aircraft they have enough missiles to cripple most of our fleet
president reagan and president bellaunde of peru have some new proposals for the peace plan sharply the peace plan

margaret writes to each of the families
as the only prime minister in the history of our country who is also a mother with a son of my own i can imagine your agony and your grief

prime minister we have secured the beachhead the argentinian troops are demoralized and ill equipped

shortly after dark last night our forces executed what our commander in chief has called a brilliant surprise night attack
margaret sits at a desk in downing street listening to the news reports
a hand turns off the radio
he heads down the hall margaret following behind
from their new positions our forces can see large numbers of argentine soldiers retreating and streaming back into port stanley
our forces are moving forward to exploit their success
intercut archive footage victory
the union jack is raised over port stanley
the task force return to england to scenes of jubilation
embraces balloons joyful embraces
margaret peering out a sea of union jacks and bunting
cheers the street lined as the car pulls into downing street the blur of noise cheering jostling banners then the shroud of black uniforms suddenly encasing the car blocking out
the light the jaunty distant sound of a military band playing well done m
the car door swings open a cacophony of cheers applause just audible far off as margaret steps out into the street the camera follows her out peering up at downing
street staff leaning out of no windows waving flags and cheering margarets gaze lingering on howe and pym amongst them smiling with congratulations clearly now part of the victory celebrations
we congratulate the men and women of the armed forces for their skill bravery and loyalty to this country
prime ministers questions
margaret is at the dispatch box fighting it out with michael foot
geoffrey howe is we were faced with an act of unprovoked aggression and we responded as we have responded in times past with unity strength and courage sure in the
knowledge that though much is sacrificed in the end right will prevail over wrong
huge cheers and hear hears from the conservative benches
michael foot shifts uncomfortably on the benches opposite
she is unstoppable
and i put it to the honourable member opposite that this is not a day for him to carp find fault demand inquiries they will happen i can assure him
of that for we have nothing to hide no this is a day to put difference aside hold ones head high and take pride in being british
we see michael foot utterly outmaneuvered by her speech
the labour benches sit silent
denis springs in the air wearing a paper union jack hat blowing a party hooter
well that paid off old girl
your ratings soared
from the most hated prime minister of all time to the nations darling
the world was at your feet and britain was back in business
quickflash a glittering ballroom margaret waltzing caught in reagans arms fleetingly passing denis looking on from the sidelines drink in hand

the berlin wall comes down
the berlin wall has fallen
the gates have opened
the police are making no attempt to stop people as they go through
headlines booming business
margaret dancing with kenneth kaunda of zambia denis stands on the touchlines toasting them a fruity cocktail in his hand
margaret hurries down the stairs her cabinet in tow
i dont agree in any measure
but prime minister the question of the european single currency will come up
i dont think the country is ready for it yet
but we cannot bury our heads in the sand
a lot of conservative mps and ministers are saying a journalist stands outside the commons making his report
that there must be a change in that style of management
that mrs thatcher must listen more and on occasion give in
margaret moving swiftly down the hall leaving her cabinet in her wake
the point is prime minister i dont think we can sell the idea of a tax that asks everyone to pay the same
our policies may be unpopular but they are the right policies
prime minister i just dont think we can ask the poorest of the poor to pay the same amount of tax as a multi millionaire
margaret seated at the wide cabinet table surrounded by a subdued cabinet
most of the familiar old faces pym heseltine etc
all now gone
howe the last enduring minister
she casts a gimlet eye over the grey suited men around her
there it is again
because because people
on the whole
think that the tax is manifestly unfair
this is a simple proposition
in order to live in this country you must pay for the privilege something anything
if you pay nothing you care nothing
what do you care where you throw your rubbish
your council estate is a mess your town graffiti what do you care
its not your problem its somebody elses problem its the governments problem
your problem is some of you is that you havent got the courage for this fight
you havent had to fight hard for anything
its all been given to you and you feel guilty about it
well may i say on behalf of all those who have had to fight their way up and who dont feel guilty about it we resent those slackers who take
take take and contribute nothing to the community
and i see the same thing the same cowardice in our fight within the european union to retain british sovereignty of britain the integrity of the pound
some of you want to make concessions
i hear some of you agree with the latest french proposals
beat well why dont you get on a boat to calais
yes why dont you put on a beret and pay of your income to the french government
she has subdued them utterly
the silence is terrible
what can we realistically hope to achieve by the end of session lord president
and why have we not made more progress to date
what is that
is that the timetable
i havent seen that
may i see it
here it is prime minister
howe pushes the papers over to her
she picks up a pencil starts to read
the ministers watch as quickly she starts to score through the words
the wording is sloppy here and here
if you say so
i do say so
its merely a first draft
margaret looks down at the paperwork
this is ridiculous
there are two ts in committee
she presses so hard that her pencil breaks so she shoves the paper back towards him stabbing a finger at the offending word
this is shameful
i cant even rely on you for a simple timetable
are you unwell
yes you are unwell
give me the pencil give it to me
margaret snaps her fingers at howe gesturing for his pencil scratching away ringing the offending word again and again
the ministers stare at the scene appalled utterly and wretchedly embarrassed
if this is the best you can do i had better send you to hospital and i shall do your job as well as my own and everyone elses
as the lord president has come to cabinet unprepared i am obliged to close this meeting
she waits for them to take their leave but they sit there frozen
slowly the men gather their papers and file out of the room leaving margaret alone
she sits gathering herself hands shaking
head grimacing with one eyeball blinded and the other detached and hanging bloody on a cheek
chanting cant pay wont pay
cant pay wont pay
cant pay wont pay
margaret peering out angry protestors slapping the glass as they pass the sense of the car being attacked
the smear of smashed egg against the window screen
margaret sinks back into her seat as the car is jostled either side by a blur of colour the bang of fists against glass the roar of the crowd archive
footage relentless images of violence over this
protestors charging police lines
police on horseback trying to force the protestors back
one of them a girl caught out goes down with her placard is trampled beneath the horses hooves horribly
rioters with blood streaming down their faces
with a whoosh of flames the north side of piccadilly circus goes up in flames
smoke and blood and fire everywhere
late afternoon margaret sits silently working
howe enters margaret barely looks up from working geoffrey my letter of resignation
howe slides a letter down on her desk margaret looks down at the thick envelope
our differences im afraid cannot be reconciled
margaret resumes working howe waits and waits and waits the scratch of margarets pen she works on refusing to stop for him
howe stands in parliament reading his resignation speech i have done what i believe to be right for my party and my country
the time has come for others to consider their own response to the tragic conflict of loyalties with which i have myself wrestled for perhaps too long
margaret walks alone down the hall
geoffreys speech in the house of commons was devastating
just couldnt take any more of the bullying
margarets pov as she moves along the corridors of power
he was almost inviting someone to challenge her for leadership of the party
fellow cabinet ministers unfamiliar backbenchers the men in suits all seem to avoid her gaze
then pym in conversation with howe abruptly terminated as both men acknowledge her
she behaved appallingly
i wouldnt have spoken to my gamekeeper like that
i dont think she can survive this
margaret stands watching the evening news heseltine just visible on the tv screen im here to announce my decision to put my name forward as leader of the conservative party
i have nothing but admiration for our prime minister margaret thatcher but i believe our party and our country need a new leader
margaret turns to denis who stands clearly shocked worst fears confirmed
the rules of the conservative party make it possible for conservative mps to depose a sitting prime minister
margaret and denis on the sofa
she unwraps a sweet eyes locked on the tv
i am the prime minister
turning to denis
offering the packet sweetie
stock footage westminster in the moonlight as conservative mps gather in westminster to discus who they will back in the leadership contest the prime minister said she would not be
diverted from critical international affairs with the eiffel tower illuminated behind him trevor macdonald makes his report
tonight in paris mrs thatcher is among thirty four world leaders who came together to celebrate the end of the cold war and herald the start of a peaceful new
age of east west cooperation
a magnificent painted hallway margaret sweeping away from a dining room regal in evening dress
paris a news journalist makes his report
theres a general feeling that mrs thatcher is going to win on the first ballot
were going to put it to bed tomorrow night is how one of her campaign staff puts it
margaret walks through a grand hall with her fellow presidents and prime minsters of the world a lone woman amongst a sea of men
m i really think you should come home and defend yourself old girl
heseltine is campaigning ferociously
i do think my time is best spent seeing an end to the cold war dont you
after all this time they know what i stand for
will she or will she not be in the job tomorrow
a grand hall a formal dinner margaret flanked by bow tied prime ministers and heads of state
margaret they cant touch you
london streets cabinet ministers walking along trying to hide their features from prying eyes
mrs thatcher has failed to win enough votes to secure an outright win in the leadership contest and must now decide whether to put her name forward for the second
as mrs thatcher leaves paris for london to make a last ditch attempt to pull together support for her leadership the ship may have sailed
margaret pushes through the double doors into her dining room
her cabinet are all around her dining room table
there is no seat for her
she moves round the table
we will never win another election led by that woman
we need a leader who listens
this isnt about her its about the party
one must know when to go
the question is how does anyone put it to her
close on a ministers face in the dim light
if you were to stand i of course would vote for you prime minister she is at her desk in the present in chester square as one minister after another
in interchangeable glasses slide into the chair in front of her
of course would vote for you prime minister but i dont think you can win
the loyalty of my colleagues cannot be counted upon
it was the people who put me here the loyalty of my colleagues cannot be counted upon
its up to them to tell me when to go
margaret stands watching the evening news
margaret you cant let them do this to you
margaret looks at denis with quiet surprise hears the desperation in his voice the crack theyll destroy you
margaret looks at denis sees he is near to tears throw in the towel now love
dont let those bastards see you humiliated
you just wont win darling
not this time
denis fingers touch hers she looks at him sees the tender concern in his eyes
margaret smiles determinedly steely under his gaze
i am the prime minister
on her face as casta diva breaks through
margaret sits alone on the front bench
a stream of voices from the past order
the right honourable gentleman is afraid
this is a naked strategy of closing some coal mines and then selling off they believe in striking i believe in working
this is the woman whos watched ten men on hunger strike starve themselves to death and never flinched
despicable and cowardly cynical falklands war more homeowners more shareholders more savings the voices begin to blend into one another white noise
margaret sips a whisky
i offer my resignation after eleven and a half extraordinary years margaret descends the stairs like an operatic heroine her hand gripping the banister of the staircase
below the downing st staff waiting to say goodbye
many are in tears
proud to have left britain in a much better state than when we took office
she passes the photographs of her predecessors and stops to receive a gift opening it whats this then
she moves down the receiving line of staff
the floor is carpeted with roses
mens wet eyes
the door ahead
she is crying
finally reaching the door margaret stands bracing herself
deniss hand on her shoulder standing behind
margaret nods bracing herself
a hand on the door handle
as it swings open margaret stands staring at herself in the mirror
the greatest prime minister since churchill deposed by a bunch of spineless pygmies
all those years of taking the tough decisions does any of it matter now
its all been turned to mush
denis lies on the bed behind her with the newspaper
by these fools
these lily livered pinkos
these inept placators
so busy taking the pulse of the public
weak pulling down a rack of deniss black oxford shoes onto the floor these
deniss clothes are all over the room and the main cupboard is open and empty apart from shoes
there are several bin liners already filled with clothes
dont they know if you take the tough decisions yes people will hate you today but theyll thank you for generations
or forget you entirely and chuck you out with the rubbish
margaret turns away from this thought and opens a last big chest of drawers
seizing shirts and jerseys and putting them on the floor all i wanted was to make a difference in the world
and you did love you did
she sits at the end of her bed and opens a box she has found in deniss cupboard
there is a programme from the king and i and a faded blue rosette from some long forgotten election campaign
a small flyer margaret roberts
conservative candidate for dartford and some childrens cards to the worlds greatest daddy love mark and carol
all i wanted was for my children to grow up well and be happy happier than i was certainly
and i wanted you to be happy of course
were you happy denis
tell me the truth
there is no response
margaret is momentarily lost in the room
then seized by some compulsion she begins to pull out the rest of his clothes shoving them into black bags
as shirts and trousers go in quick flashes of denis his youthful face smiling at her at the opera
laughing on the beach in cornwall
at the door of number smiling at her
sharing her bed
margaret looks up
deniss suitcase is on the bed
his coat and hat lying beside it
she folds his dressing gown the one from the bathroom hook tenderly and puts it on the top of the case
and there he is by her side
heres your bag
youre all packed sorted
she walks him to the bedroom door and gives him a gentle kiss
denis starts to walk away
seeing he is walking away in his socks denis wait
where are your shoes
you cant go without shoes
denis straightens his hat
steady the buffs steady
steady the buffs
denis heading out
i d said i dont want you to go yet
the endless corridor margaret calling after denis denis
i dont want to be on my own
denis turns back for a moment youre going to be fine on your own love
beat you always have been
margaret calling out as denis reaches the window at the very far end of the house and appears to disappear into the white light calling out denis
from above we see margaret lying dead asleep on the bed on a pile of denis clothes
the bed is surrounded by bulging black bin bags
mummy carol looming over margaret looking horrified
my god mum
are you alright
opening the curtains mummy you should have called for help silly old sausage
have you not even been in your bed properly
youve done all this
yes all sorted
margaret looks around her
yes well dont worry about all this
june and i will crack on with it
i was just going to get dressed
shall i call someone see if anyone can come over and do your hair
margaret looks at her warmly
no you do it
carol reacts surprised but pleased
margaret sit finishing a cup of tea
hears carols bustle in the downstairs hallway
right im off june
she stands picking up the cup
from behind oh let me do that margaret
margarets turns for a moment it is june
margaret shakes her head
no dear ill do it
carol said you might go to the house of lords today
im not going anywhere
the sound of hot water running
chink of a teacup margaret stands washing up a tea cup
the squeak of her wet cloth working on a stubborn tea stain puncturing the silence
the sound of birdsong and children playing drifts from the street outside
margaret sets the cup aside turns and walks out of the room and out of sight
