written by michael hoffman based on the novel by jan parini all happy families are the same
each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way
leo tolstoy anna karenina high angle of the steam train travelling through a wide river valley
the stack belching smoke against the russian sky
leo tolstoy sits writing on his lapboard
he is quite simply the greatest living writer in the world
his devotion to pacifism his rejection of the trappings of orthodoxy in favor of a simple christian lifestyle convince many to regard him as a living saint
with him are his much younger wife the countess sofya favorite daughter sasha and his personal physician dushan makovitsky
sasha and dushan write in their diaries
sofya looks from one to the next a little impatient
the train begins to slow
why are we slowing down
no one responds
why are we stopping
i dont know mother
tolstoy look up from his work asks a passing conductor
excuse me why has the train stopped
its the crowd mam the people
theyre blocking the track
in the distance we can here voices
long live tolstoy
long live the old warrior
but if they block the track the train cant go
you have to make
the conductor shrugs walks away
she goes to the window to investigate
a crowd of a hundred peasants students surround the engine block the track
they carry a huge cloth banner honoring tolstoy
we can hear voices chanting tolstoy
tolstoy voices crying you are the truth
you are the hope of the russian people
oh they wont move
we are gonna die here
leo leo go and say something to them
its the only way we are gonna get out of here
the chanting grows in intensity
tolstoy gets to his feet walks to the window shows himself to the crowd
a great shout goes up
tolstoy lifts his hand for silence
gradually it comes
i have seen your banner
and i ve heard what you say
you think i m the hope of russia do you
well that s not true
you are the hope of russia
the hope of all the world
you say you want a new way to live
well you are not gonna find it making a fuss over me
so i suggest that you get on with your work and let a poor old men get on with his
the cries begin
clear the tracks
let them pass
let them go
tolstoy closes the door and waves to the crowd as the train pulls away
on the chanting crowd now as the train pulls away
we focus on a handsome young man a little stiff maybe a little intellectual
this is valentin fedorovitch bulgakov
he cant contain his enthusiasm
over the noise of the train
do you know who that is
that is the greatest man in the world
the train pulls away into the distance
the ancestral home of the tolstoy family in the first budding of spring
muzhiks peasants gather wood carry water to the house
a cart arrives loaded down with mail bags
a handsome room walls covered with generations of family photographs
religious icons are given pride of place a testament not to piety but to an ingrained social conservatism a certain position in the world
countess sofya mumbles her morning prayers before a make shift altar
wiping away tears she leaves the room
sofya walks down the stairs and through the entry passed an old servant asleep in a chair
she continues to the basement
tolstoy has moved himself out of the refined upper floors into a simple vaulted room he uses as both bedroom and study
the walls are bare except for a portrait of his daughter
the furniture is simple some of it hand made a small bed against the wall a little writing desk in one corner stacked with books littered with papers more mail
opened and unopened
pairs of rude homemade shoes line a work bench
tolstoy sleeps in his bed
though its late march and still cold the window is open
sofya closes it
she stands very still watching tolstoy sleep
sitting on the bed she gently touches his hand whispers
she lies next to him something girlish hopeful in her face as if waiting for him to wake up and adore her but he sleeps on
she carefully takes his arm positions it under her neck and rolling toward him wraps it around her
the image of loves intimacy of wedded bliss
his hand slips off her shoulder once twice
she moves awkwardly to replace it
he moves a little toward her
she kisses his neck his cheek
we dont know if hes awake but even this shadow of intimacy penetrates her soul
a handsome study in the moscow townhouse of vladimir grigorevich chertkov tolstoys most articulate and dedicated disciple
hes interviewing tolstoys newly appointed secretary valentin bulgakov the young man we met near the train who at the mention of sex blushes a little
you are twenty three
not an easy age for abstinence is it
tolstoy does not approve of sexual relations
i know this
he despises them in fact
chertkov reaches for a small tin of moustache wax
i dont want to belabor the point but i arranged for a manservant last year who proceeded to ruin two housemaids just like that
he was very upset
this would not be a problem
im also a strict vegetarian
chertkov nods his approval begins to worry his moustache
yes ive heard many good things about you
ive even read what you ve written
so has he
valentins face flushes with pride
chertkov steals a glance at his reflection in the glass bookcase
one side of his moustache droops a little
he tugs awkwardly at it
my dear boy if you were to become tolstoys private secretary you would be given a great gift
youll be with him every day eat together walk in the forest by his side
its difficult to contain himself
believe me since becoming a tolstoyan i have become so eager to learn so comitted to discussing ideas improving my very soul
smiling well we have a lot to do if we are to get his work to the people
they both laugh
if we can encourage the spread of passive resistance
just think of it valentin thousands of ordinary russians casting off centuries of spiritual and political oppression in the name of truth and freedom
truth and freedom yes but still my boy there are so many enemies enemies
chertkov walks to the window signals valentin to follow him
he points to two men in plainclothes standing in the street below
the czars police
youll be followed when you leave here
and the church will stop at nothing to bring him back into the fold
his children cant be trusted
and then of course there is the countess
beat well one doesnt like to come between married people whatever the circumstances but her dogged attachment to private property her public criticism of our movement
chertkov contd beat the point is he needs a man of your intellectual gifts around him
someone who can help him with the new work
someone who understands his goals
chertkov returns to the desk
and although theyve allowed me to return to russia i cant see him
they keep me under house arrest
they might as well keep me in a cage
clearly upset chertkov pauses to get control of himself
he picks up a package hands it to valentin
so i need you to put these letters directly into his hands
one cant be sure what gets through to him
valentin looks at him quizzical
sofya andreyevna does not respect his privacy
she wouldnt open his private correspondence
chertkov raises an eyebrow
an ominous silence
i have another task for you my dear
youll keep a diary for me
he hands valentin a notebook
i need to know everything that goes on at yasnaya polyana
let me know who visits the house any talk of the copyright to his work any contact with the church what letters come and go
beat anything sofya andreyevna says
shes very very dangerous
chertkov kisses valentin delicately on both cheeks and ushers him into the dying light
godspeed my boy
valentin makes his way to the droshky that awaits him
and remember what i said
he turns back to the dark figure in the doorway
write everything down
black and white film of her being handed the newspapers at the step
she looks up at the camera irritated by its presence
cutting out to color we see a cinematographer on the lawn cranking away at his camera
she goes into the house
where tolstoy awake and dressed sits on his bed pen in hand writing in his diary
dushan sits next to him taking his pulse
hand me my other boot my friend will you
let me finish
it doesnt matter
if my heart had stopped beating id still go riding today
your pulse is my responsibility
dushan contd and if you must ride i insist you wear a coat
even the sun is cold today
he puts tolstoys arm down and hands him his riding boot
sofya comes ranting into the room carrying several russian and international dailies
this is impossible
it really is
these people are parasites
reading countess tolstoy has become estranged from her husband
they barely speak
she throws the paper on the floor
you know who spreads all this rubbish
she opens another paper a french daily
cest la meme en france
they gossip about us in paris
they do not share a similar view of either religion or politics
smiling peut etre
you think thats inaccurate
i think its none of the worlds business
she looks at dushan who is transcribing every word into his diary
he does it with all the masters conversations
what are you doing
dont do that
smiling dushan petrovich youre scribbling again
tolstoy moves with energy and purpose toward the door
darling where are you going
riding with sasha
dont expect us for lunch
something strikes him
he walks to his desk picks up his pen and quickly writes a sentence on a scrap of paper
leovochka why do you insist on dressing like that
what do you mean
like the man who looks after the sheep
its not meant to offend you
but it does offend me because it offends reason
youre a count for gods sake
he puts his pen down goes to her kisses her gently on the forehead and leaves the room
oh darling i have something else to say
i doubt it not my dear
hes forgotten his coat
he runs after him tripping over the long fur garment
count tolstoy youve forgotten your coat
meanwhile sofya notices a photographic portrait of chertkov on the wall
she takes it down and tosses it in the corner
as tolstoy appears on the porch we hear the whir of cameras
a crowd of photographers film cameramen journalists and disciples try to catch a glimpse of the master
dushan steps in front of him
let him walk
let him walk
count tolstoy youre no doubt distressed by the czars treatment of your secretary nikolai gusev
these people are bandits
i said let him walk
they come into my house and arrest a man whose only crime is to express a view of life saner than that which prevails
so gusev is innocent
nods of course im the guilty one
i reject the orthodox church
i condemn the established order and i make no secret of it
a young peasant shouts from the crowd
god bless you tolstoy
let him walk
let him walk
to tolstoy but you dont banish these people very much to your credit
i wish i had your largeness of spirit
a photographers flash goes off
an old muzhik touches tolstoys sleeve as if expecting a miracle
sasha her fathers soulmate leads two horses toward them her mount and her fathers black gelding delire
did you ride this morning
a small crowd collects to watch father and daughter embrace kiss
a wide shot of the riders cutting around we are sofya watches her husband and daughter ride away
a steam train snakes through a broad valley
valentin in his buttoned up suit looks a little out of place in the overcrowded third class carriage
he writes in the diary given him by chertkov
he glances up to see on the bench across a young mother taking out her breast to nurse her baby
he blushes doesnt know where to look
an old peasant catches his eye winks at him laughs
seven miles from tolstoys estate this is telyatinki a communal center created by chertkov dedicated to the study and practice of tolstoyism
telyatinki was created by vladimir grigorevich as a center for the movement
just last week we had a visitor from india
we talked to the group about the healing properties of cobra venum
its a beautiful day
yes but we will pay for it
sergeyenko chertkovs joyless secretary and valentin stand on a second storey porch looking out across the central lawn where a number of young tolstoyans tend the garden work to put
up a chicken coop
the meeting room is behind us
this is the tool shed
the dormitory ahead
he points out a larger building across the way
they enter the building
telyatinki is a place of freedom
nothing is forbidden here
each man is alone with his conscience and his god
beat the kitchen is below
youll be expected to assist with meals at least twice a week
and to give a hand in the garden
were all equals here you know
as tolstoy teaches us
they start up the stairs
you are expected at yasnaya polyana in the morning first thing
i look forward to it
were all envious
small sparse perfect for the novice ascetic
valentin nods his approval
vladimir grigorevich is anxious that you begin your reports as soon as possible
you have the notebook he gave you
you understand we must keep the existence of the diary a secret
what is it
secrecy doesnt seem to me the essence of tolstoys thought
but youll admit youre no expert
ill see you in the morning
if were spared
sergeyenko leaves valentin to his bare little room
the sun rising
already disciples are at work the gardens
valentin sleeps in his tiny room
a knock on the door
a lovely girl at his door
shes tall twenties high cheek bones short blonde hair
this is masha
ive brought you a glass of tea
thats very kind of you
its your first day
she sits on the bed
hes a little taken aback not used to this degree of familiarity
it makes no impression on masha
you met sergeyenko
ad what do you think
he seems very sincere
masha hands him his tea
why are you laughing
say that again
i said he seems very
is that what you think
i just arrived
whats your name
but you should still say what you think
not just about him
we all should
thank you for the tea
their eyes meet hold
valentins discomfort increases
tomorrow you can make your own
she walks to the door turns to see him still watching her
hes a sorry old tight assed stick in the mud
but yes hes sincere
a modest horse drawn cart
valentin sits beside the driver contemplates the birch trees that line the road the long shadows they cast
above crows make lazy circles in the sky
valentin stands in the entry way waiting
he looks lost
youre the new secretary
he looks up to see sasha examining him from the landing above
you can wait in the library
ivan will show you up
he hears a door close
he notices a surly house servant ivan who inexplicably leads a goat through the house
he points upstairs and walks away
alone now among tolstoys books valentin makes his way slowly to a writing table the holy of holies on which war and peace and anna karenina were written
he runs his hand along the old wood top
emboldened by a backward glance he sits in tolstoys chair
before him are stacks of letters pens and pencils a pot of india ink
theres a notebook lying open
he leans forward to read it
a noise in the hall stops him
tolstoy enters from the dining room red cheeked beard dripping wet the energy of a man ten years younger than he is
im glad youre here
he tromps across the room kisses the boy enthusiastically on both cheeks
valentin is overcome by the great mans warmth
here is valentin interrupts himself with a sneeze
god bless you
valentin pulls out a letter of introduction
tolstoy takes it out and puts it down without a glance
vladimir grigorevich has already written about you at length
i need your help badly
the manifesto against the government is hard work
they commit their idiotic abuses faster than i can catalogue them
and the new book
he told me about it
its very exciting
ive become convinced that all the worlds religions have a single organizing principle
can you guess what it is
now i want to talk about you
how are you
how was your journey
come sit down
tolstoy sits on the old sofa
valentin follows suit
you know i was born on this sofa
valentin gets right back up
tolstoy laughs pats the sofa
valentin sits down
myself my brother my children at least five or six of them right here
beat now ive read your essays
how s your work progressing
valentin looks into the great mans kind old face
he tries to speak but hes overcome with emotion and begins to weep
my boy what is it
beat i upset you in some way
was it the sofa
its only a sofa
valentin shakes his head smiling through his tears
im very happy
you are very kind
im no one and you are
you are leo tolstoy and you ask me about my work
tolstoy takes valentins hand sits him back on sofa
you rest for a moment and ill fetch you a glass of tea
rest because theres work for both of us together
he smiles and goes leaving valentin to contemplate his fortune
sofya sasha valentin andrey tolstoys son and tolstoy all clustered around a table taking tea
dushan stands near the group fiddling with a gramophone that sits on a small table
these people have nothing
it really is the most extraordinary thing
absolutely ignoring him
its not for lack of land that the muzhiks live in poverty
they have no will power and they drink too much
im not suggesting they be given land
private property is the root of the problem
we should be giving ours away
give it to whom
its all ridiculous
you think that poverty makes the peasants somehow morally superior
i believe that wealth corrupts us all yes i do
valentin fills the silence
its a keystone of the movement
oh i know all about the movement
valentin notices that people from the front lawn have moved up to watch all this
life in the fishbowl the tolstoys seem neither to notice nor care
if the peasants had money they wouldnt surround themselves as we do with footmen costing ten rubles a month
no theyd spend it on drink and whores
valentin fedorovich do you think fifty years from now people will eat while grown men walk around and wait on them hand and foot
valentin doesnt know what to say
a giggle from dushan
oh thats good
dushan having sat at table tries surreptitiously to get down tolstoys words in the diary he holds below the table
sofya flushes with anger
sneeze stop scribbling
points to her husband you all think hes christ dont you
he thinks hes christ
there is an awkward pause
flustered im not
i dont believe leo nikolayevich is christ
christ is christ but
i believe hes one of the prophets
god speaks through him
i recognize the cadence in his voice
this is unbearable
no wonder i feel lonely
im surrounded by morrons
mama youre being ridiculous
i sit here and listen to this talk of love and god and equality knowing full well that count generosity here is fully prepared to give away everything we have
exhausted you keep going on like that
why do you think we should profit from the work i m doing which is only meant for the sake of the people
she turns to see dushan scribbling again
valentin glances at sasha uncomfortable at these outbursts
a long pause
dushan tries to relieve the tension
in defense of my gift let me demonstrate
its quite remarkable really
he gets up places a record on the gramophone needle on the record
what comes forth is not music but tolstoys voice
it is a recording of a recent speech against capital punishment
his voice booms tinny and distorted
dushan walks to the machine stares at it in awe
valentin is completely caught up in the technology
its your voice
they all listen for a moment look to tolstoy for a response
another remarkable invention will supercede it
valentin blushes and looks at the table
dushan tries to hide his disappointment
please excuse me
tolstoy rises leaves the table walks out onto the lawn
dushan gets up quickly bumping the table as he goes
valentin moves to wipe it up sneezes a barrage of irritable blessings
leo nikolayevich is something of a luddite i fear
sofya crosses to the machine removes the record from the gramophone replaces it with another dushan has brought
suddenly the air is filled with the final duet from mozarts il nozze di figaro
she returns to her place
there is a long moment where all take in the sublimity of it
tolstoy walks slowly back to the table
he stands completely still
tears fill his eyes and roll down his cheeks
oh that s better
that s nice
very nice indeed
sofya crosses to her husband wipes the tears off his face
valentin watches as they embrace
do your parents often speak to each other so
across from tolstoys writing desk is sashas world a makeshift office lined with more bookcases where she does her work sending cables editing manuscripts answering endless stacks of mail
valentin sits near her learning the ropes
my mother doesnt understand my fathers goals not since his work as a novelist became secondary
his commitment to the spiritual life offends her
theyve fought about it for years
im sure she means well
sasha just looks at him
your father is the greatest writer in the world
i mean to say i feel privileged to be here
valentin feels himself slip further into mundanity
sasha goes back to her letter
god bless you
they read together for a moment
he sneezes again
irritated god bless you
sometimes i sneeze when im nervous
she regards him like an animal in the zoo
ivan appears at the door
what is it
it s a note for him
he nods toward valentin
well give it to him then
valentin reads the note
it s from your mother
she wants to see me
as valentin goes she is looking for allies
this is war
sofya is settled on a divan in a small room off the dining room
valentin sits beside her holding a glass of tea
i see a fine young man before me
nice features rather handsome in a peculiar way
thank you countess
call me sofya andreyevna
we dont stand on formality here as you may have observed
beat many young men ruin their looks by loose living
youre a real tolstoyan i can tell
i admire your husband immensely
he likes that
his ideas are beautiful
dont you think
sofya drains her tea cup signals for more
hes very grateful for the help youve been giving him
he told me so himself
i think it surprises him that a young man would be so diligent
when he was your age he was whoring in the caucasus
valentins eyes are wide
he wrote it all down
he even gave me a copy so i could read all the details
youve read war and peace
sofya smiles at his honesty
when he was writing it long before chertkov created that monstrosity at telyatinki before all this new religion and revolutionary nonsense
beat what do you think of chertkov by the way
hes given me an extraordinary opportunity
but you see what a fool he is a self serving puritanical idiot
i have to say its been extremely pleasant since theyve locked him in his house
valentin is nonplussed by her directness
when my husband was writing it in the mid sixties hed bring me pages to re copy everyday
i was the only one who could read his handwriting
i could read his intentions too
afternoons wed drink tea and discuss changes
natasha wouldnt say that to prince andrey or pierres too simple here
hes not stupid
she smiles at the memory
but i dont count anymore
she sips her tea
she glances out the door to see sasha hovering nearby
sasha walks away
you must help me valentin fedorovich
i want only what is best for my husband and my family
i could tolerate the situation if it only concerned me what i can not do is sit back while they steal my childrens inheritance
do you know i was the only person
i could understand his intention
i dont believe anyone wants to do that
sofya gives him a condescending smile
she produces a package from the table beside her hands it to him
i have a little gift for you he opens it extracts a small leather bound book
he stares at it
its a diary
beat everyone should always keep a diary
its a very popular activity around your husband
youre teasing me but i trust youll write the truth
that may not be so easy
youve been listening to your friends at telyatinki
beat write what you see
thats always the place to begin
valentin fingers the package stifles a sneeze
valentin rides into the compound
a number of the disciples are outside working
there is the ringing of metal on wood
he looks for the source
as the way clears a little he sees masha chopping away with an axe
he stops his horse to watch her
youre finished for the day
he didnt need me this afternoon
he gets down off his horse
masha continues to chop
he picks up an axe holds it awkwardly
leo nikolayevich disapproves of women doing physical labor
beat dont you find that reactionary
no i find it sweet
i find you reactionary
valentin picks up a log sets it on end and begins to chop
he doesnt do it well
masha smiles at his struggle
he admires you i believe
whats she saying
sergeyenko told me
hes miserable about it
tolstoys kind to everyone
the log is stuck to the blade of his axe
hes really struggling now
what do you talk about when youre with him
beat why are you blushing
we talk about me
he wants to know everything about me my parents my relations with women my experience of god he looks up to see masha smiling at him
and what relations are these
valentin blushes goes back to trying to chopping
almost immediately the log becomes stuck to the blade of the axe
he bangs it bangs it trying to free it
he glances up to see her still looking at him
he pounds again and again
she stops reaches for his axe touching him as she does
she lifts the big axe log and all above her head bringing it down hard
the log splits
she hands the axe to him
i had a lover before i came here
headmaster of a school where i taught
he was married happily married
it was difficult
we could make love only at school
this is somehow more than valentin had bargained for
in the gymnasium after the girls had gone
there were straw mats on the floor
he looks away to hide his confusion
have i upset you
he looks at her
i appreciate your frankness but you disapprove of me
i see it in your eyes
not at all
i think sexual activity
how men and women combine their physical parts is completely neutral
listen to you
youre a prig
just like sergeyenko
why else would they have hired you
thats not fair i dont care if its fair
he puts down the axe
do as you like
she goes back to chopping
we track in front of him as he walks toward the house
the chopping stops
he stops relieved and turns to face her
you forgot your horse
you know i think that i
he hesitates for a moment then starts toward her
her back is to him
she begins to chop again
the color rises in his face as he tries to salvage a little dignity
he grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings trips in a ditch almost falls flat
red faced he rights himself
the chopping behind him remains constant
sergeyenko watches him from the porch
close on the cable machine
a message coming through
sofya walks into the house with another stack of mail
sasha comes piling down the stairs
without waiting for the answer sasha races past her and out the door valentin and tolstoy walk together in the woods
i couldnt write
i was distracted i think
i had a dream last night about a tartar girl i knew in the war
a girl who died
a girl i had sexual intercourse with
sometimes we did it twice a day
ive never forgotten our time together the position of our bodies the taste of her
you shouldnt torture yourself
it was a long time ago
tolstoy laughs out loud
you are a virgin arent you
i try to
you know to
to be what a good tolstoyan
you see i myself am not a very good tolstoyan
you should think twice about asking my advice about anything
he laughs are you alright
kalya her name was
shes an old woman now white hair old body like me
shed hardly remember my name i suspect
she may even be dead
beat do you think that meant something
what do you mean
i mean that little romance
was there some meaning to it
it s interesting
i think you would say
i mean i ve read where you say that the physical body isn t real
that it s all an illusion
i say lots of things
what do you say
what do you think
i don t know
leo nikoleyevich smiles
i don t know either
he inhales deeply
he looks up as he hears sasha off screen
the smells stronger when the sun goes down
he presses valentins hand
ive enjoyed myself my boy
shouting for sasha as he starts in the direction of her voice
sasha appears in the clearing telegram in hand
hes coming back smash cut to a train roars past camera shaking the world
chertkov climbs down from his droshky
suddenly tolstoy is there
valentin watches them embrace
my dear dear man
tears run down his old cheeks
they embrace again
hell try again to convince your father to change his will
andrey and sofya stand together at the window watching the joyful reunion
to give the copyright as a gift to humanity
papas not in his right mind
he cant defend himself against these thieves
beat my tooth is killing me
youre a fine son darling
none of this make believe chastity and made up religion
i wish all my children had turned out like you
andreys finger in his mouth massages the offending molar
a manth responthibility ith to hith family
from her pov we see the two men walk away together arm in arm talking animatedly
chertkovs notions of virtuous behavior are calculated to destroy me
to dethtroy uth all
there is nothing more pathetic than impoverished aristocrats
she walks out of the room
and into the drive to greet chertkov
he moves immediately to her offers her his hand and an unctuous smile
vladimir grigorevich what a surprise
sofya andreyevna im happy to see you
valentin watches her match him smile for smile
and im happy to make you happy
valentin and chertkov sit together in the droshky an awkward silence
im glad to have a moment alone with you valentin
how do you think youre getting on
a little nervous i hope my work is pleasing to leo nikolayevich
he seems satisfied and thats good
the reports ive received from you however
there seems to be some confusion
what do you mean
you send me never ending commentary on tolstoys writing
thats all very interesting but not very useful
i need to know what goes on with sofya andreyevna
you must see by now shes committed to undermining her husbands best intentions
its not quite so obvious to me
because she is duplicitous
you are very bright
too bright to let her into you
chertkov fixes the boy with his intense gaze
you value our work
the ideals we share
thats why im here
good of course it is
beat do you think the countess suspects something
well i think the countess is very suspicios by nature
i don t think she likes you very much
what does she say
it s a tone i ve picked up
we simply want to distribute tolstoys work to the widest audience possible
she just has no understanding what it is we are trying to do
there s nothing in it for any of us but a real chance to increase the world s happiness
he takes valentins hand
i can only be of limited help to the master if i dont know whats going on
any effort she makes to shore up control of the copyright i must know
the survival of our movement depends on it
remember who your friends are
what youve come here to do
chertkov turns away to watch the countryside
valentin stares straight ahead his nose twitches slightly
valentin in bed writes in his diary
closing his eyes he begins to drift off when there is a noise outside his door
after a moment it opens a crack
she is there
she puts two fingers to her lips and walks toward him
she carries a candle which reveals her short hair her lovely eyes
she says nothing simply crawls into bed positions her knees on either side of him
she leans forward and kisses him
she begins to move against him
their faces touch
she doesnt kiss him but he can feel her breath
she sits up
move the book
valentin still clutches the diary to his chest
he puts it aside
masha then pulls her nightdress over head exposing her small breasts her flat stomach
she reaches under the sheets curls her fingers around him
he flinches at the pleasure of it
is it alright
he cant speak
he bites his lip as she slips him into her and begins to rock
the pleasure is too much and he comes too quickly
she falls forward on him begins to laugh
what is it
you really are a virgin
valentin tenses a little
beat hold me
he does as if hell never release her
activity in the compound
chairs on the lawn a banner being erected a long table being set
preparations being made
light spills into valentins room
he lies with his arms around naked masha
wake up wake up
i am awake
i want to ask you something
say it again
it was wonderful
they both giggle
why did you come to a place like this
what do you mean
you don t follow any of the rules
you mean why does someone who doesnt follow the rules come to a place like this
its not about rules
not for tolstoy anyway
a knock at the door startles them
valentin is suddenly in a panic
what is it
sergeyenko hovers outside the bedroom door
open the door
at the moment im indisposed
leo nikolayevich is here
he want s to see you
ill be down at once
and tell maria filipovna we could use another hand in the kitchen
they look at each other
if i see her i will
if you see her
and if youre going to behave like rabbits you should go live in the woods
valentin is up immediately
let me go out first
give me five minutes
masha just looks at him
a tolstoyan photo op
a delegation of orphans have come to pay their respects to tolstoy
he sits in a chair beside chertkov beneath a large banner leo tolstoy friend of the people
behind him the disciples lay out a vegetarian feast on a plank table
photographers and a cinematographer are strategically positioned to record the event
each child gives tolstoy a flower
chertkov in turn hands each child a photograph of the count giving money to the poor
valentin enters flushed and blushing
he pauses beside dushan who records the scene in his diary tears in his eyes
look at the love in him like jesus
suffering the children
tolstoy greets a little boy affectionately rubs his knuckles over the boys shaved head
a little girl approaches takes a photograph
he bends forward to kiss her head but she pulls away
an old man is a very ugly thing
tolstoy sees valentin lights up
my dear boy
come and kiss me
valentin beet red goes to him
he is warmly embraced
now who is this
masha comes to stand beside him
she glances at valentin but he wont make eye contact with her
youre both looking so well
life here at telyatinki obviously agrees with you
valentin sneezes mightily moves a little away
god bless you boy
what are you nervous about now
valentin takes the chair beside him
dear masha valentin tells me youre the great treasure of telyatinki
he claims youre a very gifted teacher
sergeyenko lifts an eyebrow indeed
valentin is in agony
were happy to have you with us
tolstoy notices a mosquito on valentins cheek
he takes the bug between his big fingers squeezes until it pops
chertkov watches in horror whispers loudly
what are you doing
what do you mean
he motions to the photographers
youve killed a living thing
chertkov hears a laugh behind him
it is masha who has over heard the whole thing
do you have something to say
chertkov is taken aback
valentin stares at her
what are you saying
im sorry but its a mosquito
he cant help it
hes a better tolstoyan than i am
she cant help laughing again
valentin sees the color rise in chertkovs face
its not the message we want to send
sasha suddenly appears
she holds a cable in her hand
from my mother nerves dreadful
please come home
chertkov is there
tolstoy valentin and sasha
dont give in to her papa
itll never end
i swear to god that woman has an instinct for knowing when youre just about to enjoy yourself a knock on the door
valentin opens it
its dushan with another cable
tolstoy gestures for him to read it aloud
from sofya andreyevna
i beg you
who taught her to use that damned machine
valentin starts to sneeze stifles it starts again stifles starts explodes
perhaps sashas right
encouraging this may not be the best thing
its a trick papa
shell drain you
youll be miserable
tolstoy looks from one to the other gets up from his chair
then let me go with you
no my dear ill go alone
close on sofya lying in bed
she looks ravishing in the candle light
in the background tolstoy arrives in the bedroom door
a sly smile on her lips the tension gone from her face she seems twenty years younger
sofya are you ill
she rolls toward him making it clear shes quite naked under the sheets
this is no sick bed
now that youre home
its no good you know all this
you frightened everyone
did i really
i dont believe it
im your little bird
you know the sounds i make
that was some sort of love call
it brought you back to me
she reaches out her hand to him
come out of the dark
where i can see you
he takes a step toward her then stops
why do you do it
we live in the country and you insist on making it an opera house
whats wrong with a little peace now and then
look at me
this is who i am
this is what you married
were older maybe were old but im still your little chicken beat youre still my big cock
she smiles at him
let me make you crow
a pause then a huge laugh comes up from the very center of him
he twists his neck thrusts his head upward crows like a rooster
he virtually runs to her embraces her kisses her
she is a giddy girl in his arms
he breaks the embrace and begins strutting around the room
let me make you sing
he takes her in his arms again begins to kiss her neck
do you love me
i want you to love me
he stops kissing her looks her in the eye
then another loud crow
laughing they fall into each other again
and we hear their laughter over the dark old house
valentin sits by himself on the porch writes in his diary
down below some of the disciples listen to peasants play music around a bonfire
a voice from the darkness
im not supposed to do this either
he locates the speaker by the glow of her lit cigarette
you are not supposed to smoke at telyatinki
you wouldnt look at me
it was difficult in front of the others
but it wasnt difficult in your bed
when it was only you and me in front of god
im not sure i was conscious of god
masha emerges from the shadows but keeps her distance
so i made you forget god
yes only for a moment
you forgot your rules and remembered love
you make it sound very simple
it is simple
what we did is what men and women do have done will continue doing
what could be more simple
we touched each other stayed close together
something passed between us
that is a betrayal of what
masha contd but youre afraid
all your ideas
what are you afraid of
im afraid ive hurt you haven t no
i feel a little sad but it is not for me
its for you
she disappears into the house
valentin looks after her
the countess wakes to find her bed empty
she comes through the dining room to find tolstoy on the back terrace
wrapped in a blanket he writes in his diary a cup of tea in front of him
good morning my darling
do you mind if i join you
without looking up of course my dear
he continues to write
she watches him for a long moment
she opens her diary and begins to write as well
its quite insane my darling
everyone is making fun of you
he looks up
what are you talking about
she continues to write
even the muzhiks
i heard them laughing in the barn
sofya looks at him knowingly
laughing about what
i dont want to ruin last night
she sips her tea goes back to her writing
he follows suit
after a moment
laughing about the fact that youve developed a senile crush on a fat middle aged flatterer
your passion for chertkov has become a standing joke
i have a great affection for vladimir grigorivich
let them laugh if they find it amusing
but its not amusing darling
its not normal
you hang on his every word
we have a great deal in common
you have nothing in common
you are a genius
hes a sycophant and a pervert
because he understands what im trying to do
because he tries to help me accomplish it
he is using you
you just cant seem to see it
this is absolute nonsense
that bold obese idiotic man
you treat him
he turns to her
his face red with anger and frustration
its impossible for you not to distract me
let me alone
for gods sake
youre like a spoiled child
he rises spits on the ground goes into the house
catching him up
do you love me lyovochka
of course i do
then why would you betray me
why do you say that
because of the will
tolstoy taken aback says nothing
the new will
theres no new will
she stares at him in silence
there is no new will
does chertkov have it
theres no new will
he walks up the stairs
but thats why hes come back
you talk about it you and your boyfriend
you plan for it
you have no heart for the people who really love you
youd rather be seduced by charlatans and deluded by flatterers all in the name of love
you cant even love your own children
you cant even love me
tell me where it is
there is no new will
he goes to his desk tries to ignore her
then promise me there never will be
a moments hesitation
i ve told you the truth
now let me work
please will you
he walks to his desk
tolstoy looks up from his work
sofya stands in the doorway
tomorrow ill go to the station and lie down on the track
tolstoys wife becomes anna karenina herself
see how the papers will like that
as he goes we hear
this is unbearable
you dont want a husband
you want a greek chorus
sofya is taken aback by his response
she walks out of the room
four peasants pull a water cart down a rough country road
we pan off to see sofya in her droshky resplendent in a white dress
chertkov and sergeyenko look through a crack in the interior window
their pov the countess on the sofa drinking a glass of tea
valentin enters from the meeting room
shes here to question you about the new will
chertkov nervous tugs at his moustache
how does she know it even exists
she claims leo nikolayevich told her she could examine the draft
he is obviously not thinking clearly
and now we have to put up with her petty grasping
it doesnt seem petty to me
i beg your pardon
he s her life
the work in her mind is theirs
and youre her advocate
youve been taken in by her celebrity
i worried about this
im talking about their history simply that
we should see her
act as if nothing has happened
nothing has happened
the men enter the meeting room
sofya andreyevna at last you honour us with your visit
valentin watches her match him smile for smile
and im happy to make you happy
she looks at him curiously
what is it
your moustache is
drooping one side of it anyway
nodding its a problem of the wax
sofya takes them in
let me get to the point
vladimir grigorivich i dont wish to be your enemy
im delighted that my husband has a friend who understands and shares his ideals
all i want is whats reasonable an opportunity to evaluate the new will
if you agree im sure we can be friends
youre very kind
but i cant help you
not without specific instructions from your husband
to bulgakov leo nikolayevich has agreed hasnt he val no witness you produce will change my position
but ill certainly talk to leo nikolayevich at the first opportunity
sofya is livid
i want us to be friends too sofya
leo nikolayevich is the most valuable thing in the world for both of us
we should endeavor to set things right between us
give him peace
let him work
beat valentin fedorovich
are you coming back to the house with me
valentin glances between them searching for middle ground
ill escort the countess home and be back in time for supper
masha will be overjoyed
valentins nose twitches
he looks at the floor
have you been keeping something from me
they are back in the droshky the return trip to yasnaya polyana
valentin doesnt respond
weve become close friends i think
tell me everything dear boy
i love a romance
its nothing really
a young woman in your life is nothing
masha is a friend
a good friend
that sounds serious enough
valentin looks away
i dont mean to annoy you
im not annoyed
you forget that im an experienced reader
i can read your face every letter
its beautifully clear
beat do you love her
valentin looks at sofya tears in his eyes
maybe i do
not something theyd understand these so called disciples of my husband
theyve never understood a word hes written
beat what do any of them know about love
masha carries two water buckets suspended from a pole across her shoulders
arriving at a stream she takes each bucket and fills it
its hot work
pausing a moment she kneels to splash water on her face
someone watches her from the trees
as masha wets a cloth puts it around her neck
suddenly someone grabs her from behind
she screams wrestle her way free
she turns to see valentin flushed smiling excited
he steps toward her kicks over one of the buckets
sorry sorry ill
i didnt mean to scare you
are you alright
why did you
i came back as soon as i could
it was a strange day
i love to listen to him
i love nothing more
he moves closer to her
but today i could hardly concentrate
hes very close to her now
all i could think of was you
masha shakes her head moves away from him
begins to gather the pole to refill the spilled bucket
stops her turns her to him
i think ive confused you
ive confused us both
you didn t confuse me
i was stupid
i was afraid but im not afraid anymore
valentin wants to fight through the awkwardness
he tries to kiss her
she wont have it
she pulls away
i love you masha
maybe you could help me a little
in silence he gets the filled buckets balanced on the pole
without another word masha starts toward the buildings
he doesnt know what to do
hes losing her
before the other night
id committed the act of copulation many times in my heart
he has her attention now as well as that of a number of the disciples who look up from their work in the yard
i think about you all the time
in my heart i ve comitted the act of copulation many times
i just want to say
it was never like it was with you
masha bursts out laughing
ill wait for you then
as valentin goes to catch her up he sees sergeyenko watching from outside the unfinished chicken coop
sofya wakes up
she looks relaxed then she sniffs sniffs again
out of bed she grabs a dressing gown
opening her door she spots ivan in the hall
ivan whos wearing that awful perfume
ivan a gesture indicating an elaborate moustache
she steps into the hall in time to see tolstoy chertkov valentin and sasha disappear into the library ducks back into her room to avoid being seen sofya approaches the
she can make out only a few words
mama cannot find out chertkov shushing her whispers
we push in on sofyas anxious face
chertkov sasha dushan valentin and tolstoy sit in a little clump by his desk
tolstoy his head in his hands looks at the floor
i hate to say it but the countess has become more and more dangerous
shes concerned for the welfare of the family
to tolstoy and were concerned for the welfare of mankind
to bulgakov take this down
valentin records the conversation in his diary
it s a terrible thing you ask
i can t do it
sofya still in her dressing gown climbs out her bedroom window onto a narrow ledge that runs along the second floor
sofya stand on the window ledge high above the ground
she begins to move toward the library balcony
youve been more than reasonable
she already controls the income from your property
listen to him papa
he has our best interests at heart
tolstoy looks at valentin who looks at the floor
were speaking only of the rights to your words your ideas
chertkov contd with all love and respect the countess is too interested in making a profit from your work
sofya moves along the narrow ledge as if its a perfectly normal activity
looking down she sees a couple of gawkers watching her from the lawn
she shoos them away
valentin turns his head
did he hear something
shes my wife
she s part of me
weve been together now so many years
chertkov drives the point home
but youre more than a husband and father
she must understand that
the best interests of the people are one with your own
you belong to them
valentin glances up
and is shocked to see sofya looking in at the study window
sofya has reached the french doors
she can hear clearly now
but she wont
shell never understand
a crowd of gawkers gather on the lawn below her
one man sets up photographic equipment
she waves him away turns back to the window
chertkov pushes his point
i wonder if she isnt ill
it s sadly more than possible
i know it s hard for you papa
but we must be realistic
we pan to the french doors to see sofya furious face as she listens to the betrayal
do you really think shes fit to control the final disposition of the will
we pan back to the conspirators
before tolstoy can respond sofya charges into the room
as she does she steps on the hem of her long dressing gown and ends up sprawled on the floor
the conspirators just stare at her
how dare you
what are you doing
youre all plotting against me
in my own house too
i bear you thirteen children
how can you betray me like this
beat someone help me up
no one moves
tolstoy slumps in his chair
give everything youve got to him your fat little catamite
what will it be my dearest dear my vladimir grigorivich
my wifes heart on a platter
but of course my dear chertkov whatever pleases you
permanent copyright on everything ive ever written
anything for you my love
her eye falls on dushan who very unfortunately has chosen to take this down in his diary
give me that
give it to me you little weasel
she grabs the offending volume
the struggle begins
please countess sofya mama please
she rips the book away and after brandishing it above her head throws it through the open doors with a guttural rumbling growl
she turns on her tormentors
mumbles can i not
can i not have
his face is red his body rigid with anger
youll kill him mama
thats what you want isnt it
you want him to die
she helps him up takes him to his bedroom
she looks at chertkov
dont think you deceive me for one little moment
i know exactly what youre doing
i want to see the will
its my right in the name of god
what are you afraid of
im afraid of you
chertkov looks at her with undisguised disgust
the press is bloodthirsty
had i wished i couldve demolished you and your family
you make it easy
tell them anything you like
i have too much respect for leo nikolayevich
why cant my husband see you for what you are
chertkovs face is red
he starts to speak stops
he walks to the door then very deliberately
if i had a wife like you i would have blown my brains out long ago
beat or gone to america
he leaves the room
sofya sinks back to the floor a flower wilting
she begins to weep
an aria from madame butterfly comes over from a record on the gramophone
the table is set for ten although no one is at dinner but sofya andreyevna and valentin
he is visibly uncomfortable
an awkward silence
i hope youre feeling better
do you like the opera
i took singing lessons for years
i thought about a career in music
the only thing i lacked in the end was talent
beat im sorry about everything
this aria is very beautiful
it is about a woman who is abandoned by the man who loves her
everyone is very moved by that
in the opera
a long pause
the clink of soup spoons
he doesnt sit
our life together has become intolerable
stifling a sneeze valentin gets up to leave tries to flee the inappropriateness of all this
sit down valentin
really im expected at telyatinki
she waves it off
no no no
enjoy your dinner
weve had a disagreement
no more than any other married couple
i didnt come for more recrimination
despite good cause for alienation between us i have never stopped loving you
god knows you dont make it easy
why should it be easy
im the work of your life
youre the work of mine
its what love is
aside to valentin
everything with him is hysterics i should go
beat so this is what love is
does that surprise you boy
they both look at him i thought it might be quieter but
he sneezes violently
god bless you tolstoy turns to sofya
hes right though
if we cannot live a decent quiet life if i cannot work if i cannot find some peace i shall simply go away
not to chertkov but i shall go
dushan says youre killing me
sofya rises up in cold rage
anywhere you please
she smashes a plate on the table to punctuate it and another and another
i hate you
i hate what youve become
she picks up another plate lets it fall
now she acts as if shes choking or gasping for breath
are you alright
she fights with her collar rips open the front of her dress
shouts youll destroy me
dushan runs into the room
sofya continues to tear at her clothes stops begins to pant then falls to the floor in a faint
is she alright
tolstoy tries to answer but is overcome by a coughing fit
dushan starts toward him but tolstoy waves him in the direction of sofya
he kneels beside her
open your eyes
youre lying on a fork
sit up and youll improve markedly
valentin help to get her upstairs would you
valentin helps sofya to her feet
dushan gets up himself and walks to tolstoy
im more concerned for you
we should all go to bed before something else happens
valentin sits at the bonfire with other disciples
after a while he walks towards the house
the house is quiet
valentin walks into the kitchen to see masha washing the dishes
exhausted he sits stares at the floor
it was terrible there today
they loved each other so much but you see what it becomes
she stays at the sink says nothing
masha what s the matter
she speaks without turning to him
im going back to moscow
he gets up goes to her
chertkov spoke with me this afternoon
he says i could be more useful there
valentin shakes his head
his lip trembles
this is him punishing us punishing me for befriending sofya andreyevna
this is chertkov
weve both disappointed him
i dont care
you cant go away
ill talk to him
ill make him change his mind
i m going to make you stay
no i want to go
im leaving the movement
you can t leave tolstoy
i am not
look when i read his confession it moved me valya
he was searching for freedom
freedom from anger
freedom from attachment
freedom from all the superstition and nonsense of the church
it moved me so much
i thought thats what it would be about
isnt that what its about
freedom and love
but they mix it all up
masha reaches out and puts her arms around him
her head falls against his shoulder
come with me
bulgakov doesnt know what to say
the silence gets more awkward as it gets longer
slowly she disengages herself from him looks him in the eye
im going to my room
as she starts away
dont leave me masha
i need you
she turns back for a moment
i know you do
then shes gone
sofya in her bed
a team of doctors hover over her
one of them peers into her eyes with a sextant like instrument
we move into the hall to find dr
rossolimo an expert in mental illness conferring in the hall with tolstoy and dushan
i believe the countess suffers from a mental degeneracy paranoic and hysterical chiefly the former
the doctor walks back into the bedroom
tolstoy red in the face walks away down the hall
dushan catches him
why did you bring him here
hes an old friend you know from rome
and astoundingly stupid in the way of all scientists
dushan is wounded by his uncharacteristic lack of generosity
im sorry my friend but this is all very upsetting to me
tolstoy sits on a small staircase at the end of the hall
bulgakov is already there on the step above him
take them downstairs
thank them for me
offer them a drink
youll be alright
valentin fedorovich will stay with me wont you boy valentin nods
dushan goes to collect the doctors
moments later tolstoy goes to sofyas bed
he takes her hand
she looks at him with all the love of a new bride
tears come to his eyes
he kisses her hand
i can t remember now
yo what did i say
what did you mean
you rest now
valentin watches from the doorway as tolstoy leaves the bedside and walks out
it is an autumn afternoon
valentin and tolstoy pick their way through the thick undergrowth
as they come into a clearing
valentin is surprised to see a portable table and several chairs set up like lawyers office in the middle of the wood
sergeyenko fiddles with a piece of paper on the desk
chertkov comes toward them
tolstoy stops his horse
he turns to valentin with tears in his eyes
you see i no longer feel i have a choice in the matter
he rides forward toward the approaching chertkov
good afternoon leo nikolayevich
they help tolstoy dismount
they lead him to a nearby stump and place the writing board before him
sergeyenko hands a document to chertkov who lays it on the board
this will insure that the complete works will live in the public domain
your work is the birthright of the russian people
now they possess it forever
tolstoy looks up at them
i need a pen
chertkov looks at sergeyenko who swallows hard
sergeyenko moves close to chertkov close enough to whisper
youre a secretary
how can you not have a pen
sergeyenko points at valentin
hes a secretary too
valentin fedorovich do you have a pen
valentin hesitates for a moment looks at tolstoy seated on the stump staring into the middle distance
valentin fetches it from his satchel
pen in hand tolstoy hovers over the document
a long moment
are you alright
i feel like a conspirator
chertkov glares at him
its beyond awkward
valentin looks to the sky sees the crows circling again
without further hesitation tolstoy picks up the pen and signs the document
then he moves away from the group
valentin watches him
valentin and tolstoy water their horses at a stream
tolstoy seems weary
maybe we should get back
itll be dark soon
may i ask you something that has nothing to do with work
of course my dear
do you love your wife
your youth and your desire for happiness reminds me cruelly of my age and the impossibility of happiness for me
when i was courting sofya she was so young and pure it seemed impossible that id ever have her
i didnt want to tell her how i felt and i wanted to tell her nothing else
so i wrote down a string of letters and asked her if she could decipher them
she looked completely confused thinking it was a game or
tolstoy looks into the middle distance remembering his love
i gave her one clue
the first two ys i said stand for your youth and then the most miraculous thing happened
she simply spoke the phrase my phrase
tolstoy looks at valentin as if the boy might offer some explanation of the miraculous
as if she had read my mind
in that moment we both knew we would always be together
for those first years we were incredibly happy terrifyingly happy
his old eyes are wet
and now this
tolstoy reaches into his boot extracts his secret diary
he takes a pen from his shirt begins to write
valentin is amazed
he had a pen all the time
valentin exhausted sits at the long table
chertkov appears at his office door
thank you again valentin fedorovich for your forethought
im a secretary after all
chertkov lets it go
you know i had thought for a time to suggest that leo nikolayevich look for someone else
he said no
he said he reminds me of myself when i was young
after a moment valentin gets up and goes to the study door
im leaving telyatinki
i am going to moscow
she is leading you around the nose
look you say the movements about love yes
the love he tells us to practice the love of the gospels
why do i have to explain this
the love that binds mankind together
but ive never met mankind only men and women imperfect men imperfect women
leo nikolayevich also teaches us love can not be weakminded
you wont be missed
a naive sentimentalist valentin looks at him for a long moment then bursts out laughing walks away why are you laughing
you think im ridiculous
im laughing because i didnt sneeze
tolstoy has fallen asleep at his desk his secret diary open before him
sofya enters without knocking
he bolts up groggily tries to hide the little book
sofya meanwhile holds up the letter in her hand
prozeveskeny wants to purchase the rights to your work after your death
then i shall try and die as soon as is convenient
dont be silly
theyve offered one million rubles
how can you not be pleased
i dont write for publishers
i write for people
he gets up from his desk
where are you going
valentins in the library
hes asked to speak to me
while your wretched family is left to starve
i dont see anyone starving in this house
on the contrary our privilege revolts me
she calls after him
but youre always first to the trough
always have been
sofya sinks into his chair
on the desk is the photograph of herself and tolstoy that we saw her hang on the wall in the early part of the film
she looks at the wall
there in its place is the offending photograph of chertkov that she had removed earlier
she can fix that
but as she picks up the photo of her and her husband she notices a small volume the secret diary lying under it
she begins to read
valentin waits on the sofa
tolstoy walks in goes to him
what is it dear boy
you look unhappy
what do you want to say
but before valentin can respond a gunshot rings out
sofya sits in a chair firing shot after shot at the photograph of chertkov
tolstoy and valentin enter
sofya what are you doing
she turns toward him waves the gun in his direction
valentin ducks against the wall
how could you do this to me
youre not well
you hurt me again and again
you take little pieces of me until i become nothing
i dont know who i am anymore
beat i read your diary
i know what youve done
you behave like this i have no choice
now give me the gun
give me the gun
give it to me please
sofya throws the gun at her husband
she runs out of the room
we see the shattered photograph of chertkov
after a moment tolstoy into his chair
valentin watches him in silence
id like you to stay here tonight
yes of course
with that the old man gets up and leaves the room leaving valentin in the wreckage of his world
the wind blows the trees around the old house
we see a lighted lamp move up the stairs
valentin in his makeshift bed
he is immediately awake
sasha lamp in hand crouches beside him
he s leaving
bags are being prepared
sasha is packing clothes
nothing that isnt absolutely necessary
valentin struggles to close a case full of books and papers
we must hurry
where will you go
no one responds
dushan comes to tolstoy sits down and begins the ritual taking of the pulse
meanwhile sasha wraps a heavy fur coat around his shoulders
she smiles at him
a lantern i think
its very dark tonight
beat and the apparatus for giving an enema
the horses are hitched to the droshky the bags are up on the back
dushan climbs into the carriage
tolstoy turns abruptly and walks back toward the house
hes changed his mind
hes going back to the house
they watch as tolstoy kneels on the wet grass bending low to rub his hands against the earth
after a moment valentin goes to him kneels next to him
do you want to go back
when i was a boy my brother nikolai once brought me to a place when i was a boy
he told me hed found a green stick with some words on it
the secret to happiness for all men everywhere
he hid it in the ground
i looked for it very often
ive looked for it all these years
i really believed i would find it here
but i never did
tolstoy looks at him
i never did
but this life is behind me now
he kisses the ground of his beloved home gets up and they walk back to the droshky
help me up will you
as they go he hands valentin an envelope
give this to sofya
they reach the carriage
sasha embraces him kisses him over and over
ill send for you when i can
they help him up onto the droshky and the carriage starts slowly away from the old house
out in front of the house an old peasant woman pulls the feathers off a chicken
over her impassive face we hear deep heavy sobs
sofya is in a rage
sasha sits nearby
im simply telling you what happened
i have no idea where
youre a liar
sasha wont rise to the bait
valentin comes into the room
so hes gone
to bulgakov for good
i think so yes
there is a pause
sofya suddenly smiles becomes solicitous
darling sasha where is your father
i know you know
dont play games with me
now it s not the moment
honestly i have no idea
i have this for you
it is a letter
she grabs it as if it is something that might feed a terrible hunger at the center of her
moving into a corner she tears it open and begins to read
they both watch sofyas passion
her face quivers the muscles in her neck stand out
her shoulders begin to shake
crumbling the paper in her hand she twists her head and screams
then gathering up her dress she runs out the door
sasha move immediately to the window
from her p
we see sofya streaking across the lawn
they look at each other the pond
they run out
sofya sprints away from the house and into the trees
a couple of servants join the chase ivan and vanya a fat manservant
valentin head of the group sees sofya move out of the birches
shes heading straight to the pond
sasha suddenly steams past him
sofya has reached the bathhouse
peasant women watch her as they do their wash
she glances back her pursuers races on
tiring now she goes to her knees
she crawls along the jetty toward the water
at the edge of the jetty she falls on her back then turns over most ungracefully and rolls off sideways into the pond
sofya sinks into the black water
the sound of her rescuers fades away and is replaced by tolstoys voice reading the farewell note she still clutches in her hand
my position in the house has become intolerable
what im doing now is what people have commonly done leave their worldly life behind to spend their last days in peace and solitude
slow motion she floats strangely relaxed beneath the water
i beg you to forgive me for everything ive done to you just as i forgive you with all my soul for everything youve done to me
the silence is suddenly ripped apart by the rescuers
sasha and valentin jumping into the pond
sasha barely able to swim herself thrashes in the water
sasha go back to the jetty
here let me help you
he offers his arm using it to push her to safety
with that he pushes away from the dock and makes a sharp plunge under the water
sasha watches waits
and after a long moment valentin surfaces pulling sofya with him
on the dock the servants and sasha help him to get her heavy body water soaked dress back onto the bank
she looks terrible
her tongue lolling out water drizzling from her open mouth
sasha is overcome
ivan takes action
he rolls her on to her stomach works to expel water from her lungs
this goes on for an agonizing length of time
valentin looks to the sky
dull and gray
then a sound coughing sputtering
she is alive
sasha valentin and the servants help up
let me take you to the house mother
let me die
why would you rob me of that
lets go to the house
sofya is suddenly clear almost calm
ivan go to the station
find out which train the master took
ivan looks at sasha for approval
i see no harm in it
lets get her to bed
ivan appears beside him
life returns to torture her for awhile
he laughs out loud then walks away
sasha walks into dining room
valentin pours them tea
shes exhausted herself
shes slept for nearly four hours
im glad she can sleep
the pain subsides a little
the noise subsides a little
they smile at each other
well a little
ivan comes down the stairs
he stops in the doorway
a message miss
no for your father
from the countess miss
shes allowed to send a note to my father
i just dont know where to tell her to send it
shes addressed it to train number
thats the train the master took
the station master told me
why are you giving it to me
she is allowed to send my father a note
ivan steps forward and hands her the note to inspect
sasha cant help but laugh
she never gives up
reading the note dearest papa
return at once
sasha contd sasha
she signed it with my name
she pockets the note
ivan continues to stand there
sasha looks at him
he gave me this as well
a note for you
sasha opens it reads
she looks up flushed with excitement
hes with my aunt
at the shamardino
sasha runs out of the room
sasha on horse back rides up and by the camera and away down the alley of trees that lead away from the house
theyve all gone sitting at his desk valentin looks up to see sofya standing in the doorway
she looks exhausted
she walks to his desk
youre writing to your girl
sofya touches his shoulder with real affection then walks across the room to her husbands desk
i dont know if shes my girl
but you believe youll see her again
i very much hope so
refuse to believe in the end of love
do all you can to prevent it
sofya picks up a photograph of the two of them examines it
i know you know where he is valentin
she walks back to him
i wont ask you to betray his trust
but i need you to go to him
i have to see him
i have to talk to him
i wont make a scene
promise him that
i must see him
clouds of steam against the white sky
a great black train travels through the bleak world tolstoy rests on the hard bench of the third class carriage he always insists on
he writes on his lapboard
we pan to an adjacent bench to find valentin now with them
he and sasha have a map spread out in front of them
hes right you know to go
she will be right behind us
i ve told you she has promised she wouldn t make any problems
but besides where are we going
tolstoy has overheard them
we dont need a plan my dears well simply go dushan appears with several newspapers
as he hands them the papers he reads the headlines
tolstoy looks up from the papers smiles
i guess our little secret is out
sofya sits surrounded by the papers
theres a reporter outside from the russian world
tell him weve received an apologetic letter from your father
we expect him back any day
but thats a lie right
yes thats a lie
the huge iron wheels grind on
people still crowd around him
please move back
please let him breath
please give him some room
to valentin he can t breath
to dushan the smoke is too much
where are we
he reaches out to touch tolstoys forehead
he goes pale
where are we
let me take your temperature
the old man lifts his shirt takes the thermometer under his arm
dushan reaches for his wrist
valentin and sasha look at each other wait for the vital signs
he takes the thermometer from tolstoy reads it
hes clearly shaken
good old dushan
you neednt worry
remember you are my doctor not my angel
whatever happens its not your fault
im feeling much better now
i just need to sleep
he drifts off again dushan stares at the thermometer
his eyes fill with tears
he will be fine
the train pulls into a small dusty station astapovo
valentin and dushan support help him off the train
sasha looks at the sad empty platform
weve come to the end of the world
dushan and tolstoy sit on a bench on the platform
sasha and valentin appear
the stationmaster says we may have his house for as long as we need it
there are no inns nearby so were lucky
they help tolstoy up
a little bearded man the station master waits to escort them
youll be comfortable here papa
the rest of us
well find cots or sleep in the station
and then well be on our way
valentin approaches the operator
could you send a cable for me
a message comes over the cable machine
tolstoy ill at astapovo
send it to sofya andreyevna yasnaya polyana
andrey lolls on the couch reading the paper
we must leave at once
well make inquiries in the morning mother
well rent a train
thatll cost a fortune
dont say irrelevant things andrey
ill go and pack
rent a train
press and various hangers on have begun to arrive at astapovo
outside the station masters house dushan gives an update temperature pulse
valentin emerges from the telegraph office telegrams and cables in his hands
a long passenger train pulls in from the north
theres general commotion at the new arrival
is it the countess
more press a cinematographer lugging his gear and chertkov
he spots valentin
there is no greeting no embrace
where is he
take me to him
as they make their way across the tracks chertkov can barely contain his glee
he actually finally left
he wasnt well enough to travel
its very cold
chertkov doesnt hear hes basking in his victory
its a triumph for the movement
valentin leads chertkov through the door
chertkov stops short whispers he looks so small
now tolstoy sees him wakes up smiles
its hic you
the men embrace
tears roll down the both mens cheeks
tolstoy continues to hiccup throughout
my dear friend waht is all of this
i needed hic to see you
we have so much hic to do
hic i m sorry
damn hic ups
beat have you seen sofya
ive made a point not to
i dont know when hic shell come
but shell come hic

and well be ready
ready for what
chertkov doesnt respond
im sorry but its time for your enema
dont apologize my friend
your enemas hic have become the news of the world
smiles now all of you help turn me over
everyone is asleep
valentin keeps a vigil at tolstoys bedside
his rest is fitful his breathing ragged
valentin stands and walks out
valentin approaches the little window
id like to send another cable
the man nods readies his pencil
the man looks to him for an address
it goes to masha
to maria filipovna melinov moscow
the media circus is in town
there are snack bars and huts an army camp with typewriters instead of guns
several news cameras are set up near the stationmasters house
tents have been erected as make shift shelters and offices
reporters struggle to get into the telegraph office
word goes around something big is happening
at the platform we see the highly polished private train pull in
the countess has arrived
sofya appears in her handsome traveling clothes
an unctuous little orthodox priest follows her out of the train
if the count should have a change of heart
if in the last moment he chooses to confess mother church is there to embrace him with open arms
ill see what i can do father
she moves with purpose across the tracks and through the throng reporters pelt her with questions
chertkov sasha and valentin watch through the window
shes coming this way
chertkov starts to put on his coat
not before she stops to tell them lies catalogue my atrocities
let me speak to her
he heads toward the door
sofya has reached the edge of the platform where dushan gives his medical update temperature and pulse to the press
she pulls dushan aside
reporters surround them
i want to see my husband
i want to see him
dushan is terrified
valentin arrives at the platform
will you help me
i have to see him
but im not certain if it s the best time countess
she starts toward the building
its the right time for me
to the crowd stay back stay back
as valentin arrives outside the door he see sofya physically recoil
she is confronted by chertkov and sasha blocking the door
i want to see my husband
members of the press crowd round trying to listen
hes too weak now mother
but hes not too weak to see you
not too weak to see that
she gestures in chertkovs direction
the passion attracts more onlookers
do you really want to do this here
she does her best to ignore him
i am the leper outside the gate while he sleeps with the devil himself
vladimir gregorovich is here because father asked him to be here
this stops sofya for a moment
she looks to valentin
is that true
she tries another tack
have you told him i nearly drowned in the pond
we didnt have to
it was in all the papers
valentin is very aware of the publicness of it all
let me take you back
but she plows on
what did he say
that if you killed yourself hed be upset
hed be upset
but he could not have acted other than he did
sofya begins to sob
i want to see him
beat hes not your husband
hes my husband
sasha goes back toward the door
and you are a stone hearted bitch of a daughter
sasha disappears back inside
sofya screams after her
i lost five children
why couldnt one of them have been you
chertkov watches makes little attempt to conceal his pleasure
are you finished
sofya is suddenly aware of the crowd around her
valentin will you take me back
yes of course
sofya takes his arm starts back across the platform
shaken she tries her best to maintain her dignity as she walks through the crowd
she leans against valentin whispers
ive behaved badly havent i
no countess dont worry
not at all
around her journalists ask questions photographers call out turn to us countess
show us your eyes
valentin in his wrinkled suit is asleep in a chair
he wakes to see sofya stretched out on the sofa
he watches her
she doesnt stir
after a moment he goes out
valentin emerges from the telegraph office
he walks along the platform a stack of letter and telegrams in his hands
a few reporters type their early morning dispatches
valentin comes into the room acknowledges chertkov who sits at his makeshift desk going through letters and cables
he goes to the bedside stops next to dushan
silence interrupted only by tolstoys incessant hiccups
valentin notices dushan is on the verge of tears
what is it
dushan what s wrong
listen to him
im supposed to be a doctor for gods sake
weak feverish tolstoy sits up in bed
sasha moves to help him
what is it
what is it
valentin goes to tolstoy
hes in a kind of panic
chertkov comes into the room
shes come hasnt she
she s here
he points to the corner
but it is nothing a gray shape thrown by a coat rack
youre imagining things
its true leo nikolayevich
wheres your mother
tolstoys eyes fill with tears
valentin looks to sasha
she looks from him to chertkov
shes at home
if she wanted to see me i couldnt refuse her
beat is she going to come here
all eyes are on sasha
i dont think so
i dont know papa
theres no way to
will she waiver
a long agonizing beat
shes at home
im sure of it
valentin looks at the floor
tolstoy nods pats sashas hand
very beautiful isnt it
he leans back against the pillow and drifts again
sasha gets up and goes outside
after a moment valentin follows
valentin sees her leaning against the wall
shes in pain
he said to me once
youre like your mother
youre so full of anger
she turns to him
i know its terrible
but who will protect him
i dont want him to die
valentin touches her face goes back inside and into
where chertkov has made a makeshift office
he pores through the cables letters and telegrams that litter the station masters dining table
he holds one up for valentin
kind thoughts from george bernard shaw
valentin walks to the table
you lied to him
keep your voice down
he wants to see her
you heard him say it
what exactly do you think she will bring him
i don t know they ve been married for years
i ll tell you what she ll bring
vanity fuss and noise
she promised me what
promised you what
you ve seen her at close quarters boy
you think she s capable of restraining herself
they have a whole life togehter
why do you have to deny that
youre a victim of her romantic nonsense
you seem to forget she wants to destroy everything we do
she travels with that unctious little priest
keep the priest away
these people are vultures
they send in at the last moment and welcome him back to the church
thats their fantasy
beat a death bed recantation
do you have any idea the damage it would do
everything hes dreamed of everything weve worked for will be gone
a simple noble death is what we want
it is what he wants
no you want an icon
you want to take photographs and give out postcards
you want people to kneel in front of an image you ve created
but he doesn t wanted that
he never wanted that and it will give him no peace
beat he wants to see her
let her come
they see sasha looking from the door
she turns and closes it
i will do everything in my power to prevent that
you exhaust me
i used to think you were just naive valentin maybe a little stupid
i see now youre more dangerous than she is
he turns back at the door
tell me one thing
that image you want to create just looks like you doesn t it
valentin leaves the room
the circus sleeps
valentin sits on a bench outside the station masters house
the tents erected by the press glow like lanterns in the field
some people lie on the hard platform
he looks across the tracks at sofyas private car
a single light burns in the window sofya keeps her solitary vigil
the priest has fallen asleep sitting up
she finishes her prayers gets up looks across at the lonely cottage
she can make out valentins figure on the platform
dushan appears in the doorway
solemn he gestures for him to come inside
sofya watches the two figures disappear inside
valentin sees chertkov standing near the bed
dushan returns to the chair next to tolstoy
his cheeks are damp his breathing irregular
it cant be right
his fever is down
his pulse you see
dushan begins to cry
suddenly tolstoy becomes lucid
my dear sofya
so much has hic fallen to her
everyone moves nearer the bed
tolstoy looks at valentin
whos going to look after her
beat someone needs to look after her
there is a long pause
sasha looks at valentin
shall i call her
this is it hic
he seems to smile
do you want to see her papa
its hic nothing
he falls onto his pillow asleep
its almost over
sasha looks at him shakes her head
i cant do this anymore
he won t know who she is anyway
everyone sleeps but sofya
there is a knock on the door
sofya opens it
it is sasha
has he asked for me
i want you to come
take a coat
sofya and sasha walk to the door
the reporter calls out countess
do you have any information
is he dying
is he dead
sasha takes her mothers hand
she steps into the room
for a moment she seems overwhelmed at the sight of him
she looks at valentin who nods at her as if to say go on
sofya walks past chertkov without acknowledging him
dushan lets go his hold of tolstoys wrist and gets out of the chair out of her way
she approaches her sleeping husband the love of her life her cross her everything
there is no response
she throws her arms around him
please forgive me my darling
im a fool
im a selfish woman
but i love you
please believe me
please understand me
please forgive me for all my weakness and badness
sasha takes her hand whispers
was i shouting
you have to control yourself
sofya looks around and sits back
strangely she does control herself
she becomes very still
she takes her husbands hand begins quietly to speak to him
you dont speak but i hear you
she carries on two sides of an impossible conversation
do you love me lyovochka
beat never stopped my little bird
beat and you will never stop beat never
beat nor ever leave me again
beat never ever again
lets go home
she sits very still holding her husbands hand
then it seems she feels the slightest of movements the slightest squeeze of her hand
she looks down to see tolstoy open his eyes
he looks at her for a moment the hint of a smile then closes his eyes again
valentin sees it glances at sasha
then he begins to fight for breath
a general sense of panic at the proximity of death
tolstoy fights for a last breath
sofya whispers quietly to her dying husband
please forgive me if i cry a little now
tolstoy continues to struggle then silence silence
sasha starts to sob
sofya reaches out to her daughter
sasha comes to her mother who holds her
she feels someone next to her
she looks up
i am sorry sofya andreyevna
the most unlikely thing she pats his hand
what happens from now on
it will never really matter
chertkov sits beside them
she turns to dushan
dushan could you tell them your great friend is gone
he nods walk out into the dawn light to tell the world leo tolstoy is dead
a sizeable crowd has assembled the usual reporters photographers cinematographers but students too and soldiers factory workers housewives
dushan faces the crowd
at ten minutes after six in the morning a great soul passed from our world
leo nikoleyevich tolstoy is dead
as dushan finishes his tribute a single voice begins to sing the old russian hymn eternal memory
gradually more and more of the crowd picks it up
valentin begins to sing
his eyes run over the crowd of mourners
then something stops the flow of his gaze
his eyes fill with tears
she walks slowly toward him out of the crowd
he goes to her takes her in a long embrace
im so sorry hes gone
he s gone
i know but i came for you valya
i came for you too
i love you
i love you
then hold me
the song the voices swell around them
they hold each other like they will never let go
a black draped funeral train waits in the station
many mourners are congregated on the platform
chertkov comes out of the little house followed by andrey valentin and dushan carrying tolstoys coffin to the train
sofya appears with sasha who escorts her through the crowd
the orthodox priest approaches
as a daughter of the church im sure you wouldnt object to my saying a few words at the funeral
sofya stares at him for a long moment
my husband needs no justification
besides it s been enough talking as it is
thank you father
she climbs onto the train
sofya settles into the comfort of the private car
she sits next to sasha
andrey and dushan are near her
theres a noise from outside
she looks out
below the train window valentin and masha stand hand in hand
she gets up and opens the window
excuse me countess
this may not be the time but sofya smiles valentin
and whos this
this is masha
this is your girl
is there anything i can do for you
not at all
i just wanted to say good bye
good bye good bye
god bless you
god bless you too
sofya sits back down with sasha
they hold hands
well im ready to go now
to andrey why aren t we moving
cant someone make it move
but at that moment the train begins to move
sofya looks out the window sees the people lined up along the rail mourn her loss
as she looks away we see the people reflected in the glass some of them kneel some of them remove their hats
valentin watches the train pull away
he holds masha to him
as the train moves slowly through the corridor of mourners some of them fall in and walk behind it
the camera travels up and up as the train travels north taking sofya and her husband back to yasnaya polyana
