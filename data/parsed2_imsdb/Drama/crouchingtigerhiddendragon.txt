crouching tiger hidden dragon by wang hui ling james schamus tsai kuo jung based on the novel by wang du lu security men and porters are loading wagons for a
as they work we see across the lake a lone horseman entering the village
one of the men recognizes him
master li is here
angle on li mu bai thirties powerful and handsome
in the background old aunt wu at the sight of li mu bai drops her parcels and runs excitedly into the building
aunt wu runs hurriedly through the halls
yu a beautiful woman in her early s is finishing packing for the convoy wrapping a few small items in a linen wrapper as aunt wu bursts in
li mu bai is here
please come in
yu sits composed as aunt wu ushers li in
li carries a large object wrapped in silk
its been too long
he glances around the room hows business
and how are you
an awkward pause
monk zheng said you were at wudan mountain
he said you were practicing deep meditation
the mountain must be so peaceful
i envy you
my work keeps me so busy i hardly get any rest
i left the training early
youre a wudan fighter
training is everything
during my meditation training
i came to a place of deep silence
i was surrounded by light
time and space disappeared
i had come to a place my master had never told me about
you were enlightened
i didnt feel the bliss of enlightenment
i was surrounded by an endless sorrow
i couldnt bear it
i broke off my meditation
i couldnt go on
there was something
pulling me back
what was it
something i cant let go of
you are leaving soon
were preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking
perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to sir te for me
li unwraps the object
it is an ancient astonishingly beautiful sword
the green destiny sword
youre giving it to sir te
he has always been our greatest protector
i dont understand
how can you part with it
it has always been with you
too many men have died at its edge
it only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade
you use it justly youre worthy of it
its time for me to leave it behind
so what will you do now
li doesnt reply
come with me to peking
you can give the sword to sir te yourself
itll be just like old times
first i must visit my masters grave
its been many years since jade fox murdered him
i have yet to avenge his death
and yet im thinking of quitting
i must pray for his forgiveness
join me once you have finished
i can wait for you in peking
customs officials have just finished checking the contents in a row of carriages bearing the sun security insignia
the caravan slowly passes through the checkpoint into the boundaries of peking
yu riding a handsome horse and clearly the leader watches as her crew clears inspection
lets go into the city
workers are busy unloading the contents from the carriages
boss giao is checking off the merchandise a cargo of medicinal herbs
everything got here safely
im much obliged
just doing my job
sun security has been the best since your father started it
youre a credit to his memory
i mean it
from a gray tiled roof we can see pekings magnificent grid of houses extending miles and miles out freshly painted by the morning sun
dusty and congested as always people horses and carriages are fighting to get through the boulevards
a group of jugglers perform at a corner
yu surveys the busy street from on top of her horse
yu presents the sword to sir te
this is lis personal sword a great heros weapon
he is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it
its too fine a gift
i cannot accept it
it has brought him as much trouble as glory
help him to leave these troubles behind
otherwise hell never be able to start anew
ill act as the swords custodian
de lu the head servant enters
governor yu has arrived
i must change
getting up youve always been so good to li mu bai and me
please accept our thanks
please do not be such a stranger
youll stay the night as my guest
now shu lien
tell me something
and forgive me for prying
your father was a great friend to me and i think of you as my own daughter
please sir te what is it
li mu bai giving up his sword and his warrior days
maybe hes trying to tell you something
i dont know
dont be coy
ive always known about your feelings for each other
all these years its a shame
neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other
youre both wasting precious time
i beg your pardon
li mu bai and i arent cowards
when it comes to emotions even great heroes can be idiots
tell me if li mu bai is not more open the next time you see him
ill give him an earful
yu and de lu approach the study
sir te said to leave the sword in here
de lu opens the door and is startled to find a young woman inside
the woman is studying the sheets of calligraphy hanging on the walls
who are you
im your guest today
i am governor yus daughter
this is sir tes study
you are here to
i was looking for a quiet corner
i am sir tes head servant
and this is another of our guests
yu gently lays the sword still in its sheath in jens hands
its heavy for such a thin piece of metal
the handle is heavy
and the blade is no ordinary metal
still the sword is the lightest of weapons
youre just not used to handling it
but i have had much practice
as a child in the west a platoon lived with us
theyd let me play with their weapons
the scabbard is so beautiful
beautiful but dangerous
once you see it tainted with blood its beauty is hard to admire
its years old
you said it belongs to
my friend li mu bai
hes given it to sir te as a gift
li mu bai
the famous warrior
why would he give his sword to sir te
youre too young to understand
youre a sword fighter too
yu yanks the sword out of the sheath
an eerie sound resonates within the study
jen is even more impressed
yes i am
but i prefer the machete
certain moves however call for a sword
yu puts the sword back in the case
longingly it must be exciting to be a fighter to be totally free
fighters have rules too friendship trust integrity
without rules we wouldnt survive for long
ive read all about people like you
roaming wild beating up anyone who gets in your way
writers wouldnt sell many books if they told how it really is
but youre just like the characters in the stories
no place to bathe for days sleeping in flea infested beds
they tell you all about that in those books
you know what i mean
im getting married soon but i havent lived the life i want
so i heard
its the most important step in a womans life isnt it
youre not married are you
what do you think
you couldnt roam around freely if you were
youre probably right
yu studies jen
the room falls silent for a moment
its dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple
jen is leaving the study escorted by her maid
she turns to yu for a final good bye
yu seems intrigued by the encounter
two lighted lanterns are raised up
sir te hands the sword to governor yu
go ahead governor yu
governor yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the sword
he closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword
te snubs out the flame from a candle then slides the sword out from its sheath
the sword gives off a luminous blue glow in the dark
two feet inches long
the handle is inch deep
seven tenths of an inch thick
with seven rubies missing from the hilt
you can tell the design dates back to before the chin era
engraved with a technique lost by the time of the han dynasty
your knowledge is remarkable sir te
a sword by itself rules nothing
it comes alive only through skillful manipulation
i see your point
the imperial court isnt the problem
with royalty and officials everywhere the royal guard keeps security tight
but peking is not like the west
here youll find all sorts of characters
proceed with caution in your quest for law and order
dont depend only on the court
contacts in the giang hu underworld can ensure your position
be strong yet supple
this is the way to rule
a maid warms her hands in a basin of hot water for jen then walks over to jen and helps remove her earrings
someone knocks and the maid goes to answer the door
let me do it
the maid leaves as the governess enters the room
ive made you silk pajamas
do you want to change into them
put them down
i heard you met shu lien today
do you know her
shes one of those
your mother would not want you consorting with her kind
jen shoots her an angry look
ill socialize with whomever i please
dont invite danger into your fathers house
shes about to say something then thinks better of it
im tired now
go to bed then
miss has grown up and is getting married soon
god knows what the future will bring
it will be just the same
autumn is coming
ill shut the windows for you
the governess leaves
jen sits on the side of her bed thinking
a wide shot of the compound
a patrol man greets master bo sir tes head of security
the place is serene
yes master bo
as bo walks on shadows rustle in a treetop in the background
a masked figure silently opens the window and enters the room
it moves swiftly to the sword case opens it and wraps the sword
bo enters sees the thief who leaps up to the ceiling
the thief steps over bo and out into the courtyard
bo tries to stop the thief who easily outwits him jumping onto the roof as bo yells out
hes on the roof
the swords been stolen
the thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street
bo grabs a pole and runs as gongs begin to sound alerting people to the theft
people rush outside yu shu lien among them
bo runs through the streets
the thief is nowhere in sight
suddenly there are sounds of weapons clashing
bo hurries towards the source
bo is surprised to see the hooded figure battling with two other fighters tsai male s and may his daughter
its jade fox
we must avenge mother
the hooded figure does a gravity defying flip and soars over a wall just as bo arrives
hes getting away
the thief runs atop a roof right into yu
yu and the hooded figure face off
return the sword and ill let you go
the figure just regards her slightly shifting weight
yu attacks but the figure repels her
youve been trained at wudan
the figure answers by leaping to another rooftop
yu catches up and resumes her attack with a relentless series of lightning quick blows
bo follows tsai and may who are quickly walking away
were just street performers
we were rehearsing
you were rehearsing
who are you trying to fool
may wants to respond but is again cut off by tsai
they run off
where did that thief go
bo looks around and discovers he had chased the thief into governor yus compound
governor yus house
yu and the black figure continue to fight
get down here
give back the sword
yu slowly gets the upper hand in her fight with the thief
a small arrow cuts across the night and flies toward yu
she catches it but the masked figure takes the opportunity to get away
yu pauses to feel the arrow in her hand standing in the empty courtyard
de lu escorts yu into tes
sir te awaits you
men are standing at attention
bo is giving his account of what happened as yu enters
im sure the thief is in the yu household
how dare you imply
but i say enough
the men hustle out
bo can barely contain his frustration
has governor yu ever seen the sword
yes though i doubt hes involved in this
but the sword could be in his compound
then someones trying to set him up
we should inform li mu bai
madam yu is returning from temple
the governess is helping her out of the carriage
servants are peeling bills off a wall across the street
what is it
madam yu someones put up posters
a partially torn flyer with the words jade fox will not escape justice
is seen on the ground
let me see
someone is after jade fox
preposterous looking for her here
madam yu nods and walks inside as the governess tosses the flyer away and follows her
a hand scoops up the flyer it is yu
she studies it then puts it in her pocket and moves on
bo is searching for the tsais
the bridge is full of jugglers
but the two are nowhere to be found
bo quizzes a homeless man
where are they
i dont know
i havent seen them in two days
bo is about to give up when he looks up and sees may walking quickly into an alley
bo follows her
may walks into a dilapidated house surrounded by a broken down bamboo fence
bo inches closer and sees may and tsai oiling their weapons
jen practices calligraphy
the governess is by her side embroidering and throwing occasional glances at jen
the maid enters
there is a miss shu lien here to see you
jen stops and looks up at them
miss is busy right now
ill tell her
show her in
the governess shoots her a look
this spells trouble
i have a guest
the governess gets up to leave just as the maid shows yu in
this way please
the governess and yu exchange quick glances
the governess bows slightly and departs
ive missed you
yu sees the calligraphy
youre doing calligraphy
ill write your name
just for fun
jen writes yus name with great confidence and swiftness
i never realized my name looks like sword
jen freezes slightly
you write gracefully
calligraphy is so similar to fencing
maybe it is
i wouldnt know
the maid enters with tea
thank you for seeing me
i hear your wedding day is near
you must be overwhelmed by the preparations
im hardly doing a thing
the less i think of it the better
my parents are arranging everything
the gous are a very powerful family
my marrying one will be good for my fathers career
you are fornuate to marry into such a noble family
i wish i were like the heroes in the books i read
like you and li mu bai
i guess im happy to be marrying
but to be free to live my own life to choose whom i love
that is true happiness
do you think so
let me tell you a story
about you and li mu bai
did you know i was once engaged to be married
his name was meng si zhao
he was a brother to li mu bai by oath
one day while in battle he was killed by the sword of li mu bais enemy
after li mu bai and i went through a lot together
our feelings for each other grew stronger
but how could we dishonor mengs memory
so the freedom you talk about i too desire it
but i have never tasted it
too bad for meng but its not your fault or li mu bais
i am not an aristocrat as you are
but i must still respect a womans duties
dont distance us
from now on lets be like sisters
then as a sister let me wish you happiness in your marriage
the maid escorts yu out
yu pauses looks around and sees the profile of the governess peering at her from around a corner
moonlight spills into the room as jen rises sleeplessly from bed and looks out the window
a light breeze stirs her hair
the sound of the wind rises and slowly her face dissolves into
the face of a younger less sophisticated jen as she lets the dry desert air flow through her hair
she sits in a carriage part of a caravan with guards on horseback that is traveling through the spectacular desert
across from her sits her mother of whom she is barely cognizant
what a godforsaken place
cant your father be appointed closer to civilization
are you listening to me
jen is still looking out the side of the carriage at a beautiful mountainside
jen sighs and turns back toward her bed
tsai and may have been sitting hidden in the branches of a tree watching jen
they drop down silently and walk away
from another rooftop lo looks silently on
tsai and may enter the house
inside the tiny house they discover a hooded figure going through their belongings
immediately tsai throws a knife which rips off the figures mask revealing bo
tsai has another long knife at his throat
who are you
im a friend
may fans a small coal fired grill that is boiling a sizzling pot of vegetable and meatball soup
her father and bo are now friendly dinner companions much to mays delight
i dont care about your sword
why were you spying on the yus
im looking for someone
im a police inspector from shaan xi gen su district
jade fox is a master criminal
i hear she infiltrated the yus
she must have come with them when they transferred here
but with yus reputation i cant just go in and accuse her
this jade fox is a woman
then leave her to me
pardon me but i doubt you can handle her
my wife was quite a martial arts expert
jade fox killed her
so you see this is personal
leave her to me
re the soup im ready for anything
bo fishes into the pot with his chopsticks
may intercepts him with her own chopsticks
father gets first dip
tsai stiffens and snaps his chopsticks not to pick up a meatball but to catch an incoming dart
a dart wrapped with a note
bo jumps up
what does it say
well settle this at midnight on yellow hill
good the fox is out of her hole
yu is ushered into the room to discover sir te talking to another man whose back is to her
shu lien look whos here
the man turns around its li mu bai
yu and li mu bai sit together
sir te believes its a ploy cast suspicion on governor yu
but something is going on at the yu household
what have you discovered
from her sleeve yu removes the flyer
li takes it his face darkening
you always suspected shed fled to the west
i didnt think shed dare come back to peking
is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu
so i shall avenge my masters death after all
sir te requires discretion
official business is difficult enough
dont let personal feelings make it worse
and i dont know
even this poster
could be some sort of trap
did you see who posted it
it says jade fox is hiding at yus
on the night of the theft there was a brawl near yus
were you involved
it was bo sir tes man
i hear he followed the thief to the yus
have you questioned him yet
no not yet
but your men are watching over yus compund
no id already sent them home
you can blame me for losing the sword but please trust that ill get it back soon using my own methods
thats not what i meant
i dont care about the sword
what do you mean
didnt you come back here for it
i dont know it was stolen until i got here
then why did you come
well we had talked
de lu enters
pardon my intrusion
master li your room is ready
please lead the way
tsai bo and may wait under an ancient tree
bo stifles a yawn
the fox doesnt care much for punctuality
still no sign of her
an old lady struggles up the hill wearing a floppy hat over her face holding a cane
the three exchange glances
the old woman shrinks in fear but then throws off her disguise and unveils herself the governess
you will pay for your stubbornness
thats what you think old witch
if you surrender now youll suffer less
but if you resist i wont stop until youre dead
let me avenge my mothers death
youll soon end up like her you little whore
youll pay for that
a fierce battle begins the main fighting between tsai and fox with may and bo getting a stab in occasionally when the opportunity presents itself
to bo shes going to paralyze you
using acupressure fox disables bo
may shoots an arrow at her but she catches it and flings it back hitting may
fox then disables tsai but just as she goes for the kill li mu bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them
tsai you filthy mongrel
father are you all right
li addresses fox
wudan should have gotten rid of you long ago
its been a long time jade fox
you dont remember me
but you should remember my master
you infiltrated wudan while i was away
you stole our master
now its time for you to pay
your master underestimated us women
sure hed sleep with me but he would never teach me
he deserved to die by a womans hand
you stole the secrets of wudans highest martial arts
but after ten years of training your moves are still undisciplined
and today under a wudan sword
you will die
li easily brings fox to the ground
li raises his sword to the prostrate fox
a figure masked in black appears next to fox sword extended saving her
disciple well kill them all
i must get rid of tsai
fox fights tsai bo and may as li addresses the masked figure
who are you
why is the green destiny in your possession
whats it to you
my name is li mu bai
the green destiny is mine
jade fox cant be your master
where did you learn that xuan piu move
im just playing around
tell me who is your master
we must kill them
tsai throws his blade at fox who catches it and throws it back hitting him in the head
fox and the masked figure leap away
may drops to the ground cradling her dead fathers head
bo kneels beside her
te and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed from over the body of tsai
bo and may stand before them
this is tsai
police inspector from shaan
this should be reported to governor yu
the victim is an officer
you believe the killer is hiding out in his compound
id bet my life on it
to li and yu come with me
he exits the room
te li and yu are seated
this needs to be resolved and quickly
ill get into the yu household and get her
ill ferret out fox and her gang
we must be careful
governor yu is a court official and in charge of security
any disturbance will cast suspicion on him
it might get sir te in trouble
this is a delicate matter
sir te can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter
what do you have in mind
the best way to trap a fox is through her cubs
sir te and li look puzzled
yu sits with madam yu and jen
they busy themselves with various items for her trousseau
madam te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts
shes being so considerate
im sorry shes not feeling well enough to receive you today
i heard sir te lost something
and now madame tes not feeling well
jen sits silently reading
we know who stole the missing item
if the thief returns it im sure sir te will pursue the matter no further
sometimes the help cant keep their hands to themselves
its very embarassing
sir te knows that even well meaning people can make mistakes
that can bring ruin to themselves and their families
but dont be too lenient
no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking
the very killer of li mu bais own master
last night she killed a policeman who had tracked her down
a female criminal
now thats news
jen becomes visibly upset
you say she killed a policeman
yes from the west
he went undercover and and followed her here maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same
i doubt it
it very unusual
as yu speaks she lifts the tea pot to pour jen some tea
as she finishes speaking she looks into jens face and the pot slips from her hand
without even looking down jen instinctively catches the pot with a lightning fast move
and most likely smarter than a mere killer
sir te and li mu bai walk by
formal greetings sir te
hello madam yu
this is li mu bai the renowned swordsman
delighted to meet you
li sizes jen up
miss yu is soon to be married
may opens her door only to find bo standing guard
why dont you come in
im standing guard
she turns back inside hesitates then turns back to him
we dont have to fear jade fox if were together
a still dark night
something moves in the moonlight
a hooded figure jumps down
li mu bai who had been hiding in the shadows comes forward
isnt it a bit too late to be out
youve brought me the sword
i do as i please
the masked figure lunges away but li mu bai leaps with incredible speed and grabs the sword from her
wheres your master
whats it to you
the figure floats away
li chases after her
the two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops displaying amazing floating skills
the figure bounces into an old monastery
li is already there
had enough flying
youve got potential
youve studied the wudan manual but you dont understand it
you need a real master
the figure doesnt respond but we sense the pride in her eyes
do you think you are a real master
like most things i am nothing
its the same for this sword
all of it is simply a state of mind
stop talking like a monk
then tell me where jade fox is
real sharpness comes without effort
the figure leaps into the garden but again li is ahead of her
the figure attacks li who uses his agility to evade her
frustrated the figure intensifies her attack
the figure losing composure attacks wildly
li gets even more elusive using a branch to repel her
no growth without assistant
no action without reaction
no desire without restraint
now give yourself up and find yourself again
there is a lesson for you
li now holds the stick to her mask gently raising it slightly
why should i
you need practice
i can teach you to fight with the green destiny but first you must learn to hold it in stillness
why do you want to teach me
ive always wanted a disciple worthy of wudans secrets
and if i use them to kill you
thats a risk im willing to take
deep down youre good
even jade fox couldnt corrupt you
the figures eyes cloud with tears
wudan is a whorehouse
keep your lessons
the figure swirls and takes off leaving a rueful li standing alone in the monastery
jen slips in through the window
she pulls off her mask as she spots the governess fox sitting and sewing
youre home late
or should i say early
why are you still here
you killed a policeman
you should leave
youll bring ruin on my whole family
they wouldnt have found me if you hadnt stolen the sword
like a little girl you thought stealing would be fun
you too are responsible for that death
come with me
you dont want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat
denied your talent
as a master and disciple we will rule
ill never live as a thief
youre already a thief
that was just for fun
how can i leave
where would i go
wherever we want
well get rid of anyone in our way
even your father
its the giang hu fighter lifestyle
kill or be killed
exciting isnt it
i owe you nothing
yes you do
you are still my disciple
jen lunges at the governess and the two exchange a few blows
jen presses her finger against one of the governesss pressure points disabling her
jen pushes her across the room
you think youve been teaching me all these years from the manual
you couldnt even decipher the symbols
i studied the diagrams
but you hid the details
you wouldnt have understood even if i had tried to explain
youve gone as far as you can go
i hid my skills so as not to hurt you
if i hadnt seen you fight with li mu bai id still be ignorant of all youve hidden from me
i started learning from you in secret when i was
you enchanted me with the world of giang hu
but once i realized i could surpass you i became so frightened
everything fell apart
i had no one to guide me no one to learn from
believe me ive a lesson or two left to teach you
the governess leaves a small sack over her back
li practices fluently with green destiny in hand beautifully at ease with the weapon
he spins around to find yu standing in the doorway
the sword is back
are you happy
i admit getting it back makes me realize how much id missed it
but its not your sword anymore
you gave it to sir te
but i must borrow it for one last mission
jade fox must die at its edge
did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl
my job was to get the sword back without embarassing anyone
i wasnt about to ruin her life or her fathers
you did your job well
but this girl
i saw her last night
i knew she would intrigue you
she needs direction
shes an aristocrats daughter
shes not one of us
in any case it will all be over soon
youll kill fox and shell marry
thats not for her
she should come to wudan and become a disciple
but wudan does not accept women
for her they might make an exception
if not im afraid shell become a poisoned dragon
its not our affair
even if wudan accepts her her husband might object
i thought by giving away the sword i could escape the giang hu world
but the cycle of bloodshed continues
i wish there were something more i could do to help you
just be patient with me shu lien
jen is asleep
a noise awakens her
lo opens the window and sneaks in right into the point of jens waiting sword
jens sword drops to the ground
lo grabs her by the wrist
you shouldnt have come
with all the traffic on your rooftop these days
it took me a while to get in here
i cant wait any longer
i was wrong to let you go
come back with me
youll be happy in the desert
youll be free there
jen turns back to him and rests herself briefly in his arms again
youve been looking for me all this time
jen holds up a comb with daylight shining through it
jen admires the piece her most prized possession
madam yu sits opposite her
stop playing with it
jen looks out over the desert as the wind picks up and the sky darkens
i wont break it
lo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan
its dark cloud
dark cloud is coming
his warning is useless
from jens pov we see the guards slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords
lower the shade dont let them see you
dont touch the women
though unharmed madam yu immediately faints
lo approaches the carriage and grabs the comb from jens hand
she bolts from the carriage and once outside bends down and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard whose horse flails beside him
she looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their escape on horseback
jen and lo ride across the desert floor at breakneck speed
come get your comb
she tries to jab him with the lance but he grabs it and flings her off her horse
hurry back to your mother
lo rides on as she charges after her horse
a group of bandits is dividing up the loot as jen rides up keeping a respectable distance
they notice her and rise as she dismounts
one of them saunters over to her and stands grinning a few feet away
in a second shes slammed his balls into his stomach and knocked his nose into his face
he crumples to the sand
the other bandits stop laughing quickly exchange glances and charge her at once
in a matter of seconds theyre either on the ground or dragging their fallen comrades back
lo calls out and stops the fight
lo and jen ride if not side by side then parallel about feet apart
their pace has slowed considerably
in fact theyre dead tired
lets stop a moment
give it back
shouting a bit youre tired
you need rest
your horse needs water
theres a creek up here
he dismounts looks down at the dry creek bed
well there used to be
whats your name
the hans call me dark cloud
im not that tall or big but im quick as lightning
she kicks him
they fight ferociously until lo exhausted collapses
she kicks him a few times then collapses too
jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of animal fur
she sits up with a start and checks her clothes
looking around she realizes shes in a cave
next to her are a lamp some hunting equipment and a neat row of sharp arrows
she quickly grabs one of the arrows
if you like that arrow i can make you a bow
great for hunting wild chicken
jen raises one of the arrows going on the attack again but her legs betray her and she falls
you need to eat understand
then youll have the strength to fight
he helps her up then pours her some horse milk from a sac
he hands her a small chunk of food which she first accepts grudgingly then her hunger getting the better of her she starts to wolf it down
youre eating too fast
lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape
a chicken roasts over a fire
jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head
lo passes out as jen scurries away
jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony terrain her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered
but soon she passes out
jen again awakes inside the cave
lo tries to feed her some water but she chokes and tries to push him away only to find that her legs and hands are tied up
youve got quite a temper
its better this way
still in a bad mood
at least youre speaking
whats your name
jen spits at lo
i didnt think the hans had names like that
later she weaves in and out of consciousness
in the flickering lights she sees lo sharpening his arrows
later he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift bathroom a water filled cavity serves as a tub
he rises as jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and dishevelled body
he comes over and unties her
if i had wanted to i would already have done it
you must be dying for a bath
fresh waters hard to get here
but i managed to bring some up
you can wear my clothes when youre done
ill sing so youll know where i am
after the bath youll be calmer
jen nods and the bandit releases her
he starts to sing as he walks out
jen waits until the sound recedes before closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit
while she bathes she listens to his singing a loud rendition of a tribal song
lo apparently doesnt remember all the lyrics and la las his way through more than a few passages
jen grimaces as lo pulls the last of some cactus needles from the soles of her feet
no more hitting on the head
all this trouble for a comb
it means a lot to me
a barbarian like you wouldnt understand
i can use it to pick fleas from my horse
by the way im a real manchurian
i guessed wrong
i though you were a han
give me back my comb
i dont take orders from anyone
give it back
jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs lo drawing a little blood from his chest
furious lo lunges at her and they tussle briefly
finally lo gets on top of jen and the scuffling becomes more like foreplay
violence turns into unleashed passion
lo and jen ride across the desert
jen holds tightly to him
lo and jen lie in the bath together
when i was a boy one night i saw a thousand shooting stars
i thought where did they all go
im an orphan
i used to look for stars alone
i thought if i rode to the other end of the desert id find them
ive been riding in the desert ever since
and so the little boy became a fearsome bandit
he couldnt find the stars so he stole my comb
out here you always fight for survival
you have to be part of a gang to stand a chance
slowly your gang becomes your family
all that dark cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier
so youre still that little boy looking for shooting stars
i am a man
and now ive found the brightest star of all
lo sees uniformed men through his binoculars
your fathers men are looking for you
jen doesnt respond
lo and jen ride through a mountain pass
lo and jen stand at the crest of a cliff
lo looks over viewing the desert valley below as jen joins him
they see a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance
your fathers men are still looking for you
theyre still out there circling closer
let them look
it is trouble for me
jen bites her lip
dont send me back
you must decide
you might get tired of this life
you might begin to miss your family
if it were our daughter wed look for her too
she would miss us
i want you to be mine forever
i will make my mark on the world
i will earn your parents respect
we have a legend
anyone who dares to jump from the mountain god will grant his wish
long ago a young mans parents were ill so he jumped
he didnt die
he wasnt even hurt
he floated away far away never to return
he knew his wish had come true
if you believe it will happen
the elders say a faithful heart makes wishes come true
jen and lo kiss
jen takes the jade comb out of her hair and presses it into his palm
jen starts to cry
keep it safe
return it to me when we are together again
smiling painfully if you dont ill come after you
and i wont let you off so easy
jen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning light
end of flashback
wherever i went someone always recognized me
i really tried
later i heard you came to peking
i was afraid id never see you again
so i came
i cant let you marry
jen is about to respond when a servants voice is heard from outside the door
through her tears dont ever come back
lo hovers at the window frame
so its over
lo thrusts a small object in her hand
he lifts his legs through the window and drops out of sight just as jens door is opened from the hall
we heard noises
it was just a cat
the maid pauses then dutifully exits closing the door
jen opens up her palm gasping she sees the comb that lo has given her
the noise and color of a wedding procession
a marching band heralds the occasion as throngs of onlookers fight to get a glimpse of the groom gou jun pei who trots by on a handsome white horse
jens head is completely covered in red cloth as she rides silently in the brides carriage
li and yu watch the festivities from a balcony of the city gate
you think jade fox will show up
shes out there but i doubt shell show herself
well keep our eyes open
sooner or later shell come for the girl
a small arrow flies into the carriage
jen calmly lifts the red cloth from her face and pulls the arrow out of the panelling inside the carriage
we hear los voice from outside the carriage but jen doesnt seem to notice
come with me
lo runs wildly into the crowd
come with me to the desert
come with me to xin jiang
the guards surround lo but he escapes
lo leaps and lands right in front of li mu bai his fingers pressed against los neck
yu comes running around the corner and sees them
where is jade fox
yu jumps in and pushes li away
to lo come with me
lo sits dejectedly having told his story to yu and li who look him over
to lo you thought shed give it all up and go back west with you
either way you are no good to her dead
with the gou and yu clans hunting you youll soon be in their hands
i dont care anymore
if you truly loved her you wouldnt say that
dont you want to see her again
ill write you an introduction
take it to wudan
wait there for news from me
yu and li enter as other men and women race through the compound a sense of panic in the air
yu gives li a look
a crowd including li and yu stand by as te opens the empty sword case his voice rising
when will this end
they take it they put it back they take it again
my home is turning into a warehouse
bo bursts into the hall bows to te
jen has run away
gou found the wedding chamber empty
governor yu requests your assistance
you know the giang hu underworld
he wants to find her and keep her from harm
sir te leave this to us
jen arrives at the tea stall
she places her sword on the table which catches the attention of a couple of giang hu martial arts characters sitting nearby
what can i serve you
as the waitress turns to leave jen grabs her by the arm
the cup is dirty
the flustered waitress apologizes and takes the cup away
the men approach jen
what is your name
without lifting her eyes long
its young master long
im iron eagle sung and this is my brother in arms flying cougar li yun
what brings you to huai an and where are you headed master long
anywhere theres action
the two men exchange glances
in that case perhaps we could be of assistance
you dont seem to understand
so what if i dont
we have ways of helping you understand
the two pull out their weapons which are immediately chopped into scraps by jen
stunned are you related to li mu bai
he is my defeated foe
li and yu pass a cup back and forth as bo tends to the horses in the background
have some tea
as yu passes the cup to li their fingers touch
embarrassed li pulls back
the things we touch have no permanence
my master would say
there is nothing we can hold on to in this world
only by letting go can we truly possess what is real
not everything is an illusion
wasnt that real
your hand rough and callused from machete practice
all this time ive never had the courage to touch it
li takes yus hand and presses it to his face
giang hu is a world of tigers and dragons full of corruption
i tried sincerely to give it up but i have brought us only trouble
to repress ones feelings only makes them stronger
youre right but i dont know what to do
i want to be with you
just like this
it gives me a sense of peace
li mu bai smiles
jen walks upstairs
a waiter greets her
please follow me
i want a clean room
we have plenty
jen again sets her sword on the table as she sits down
steamed whole cod bite size meatballs a little starchy but keep the sauce light shark fin soup mixed vegetables and some warm wine
dazed i have to order from a bigger restaurant
the waiter gauges jen for an instant before bouncing off to place the orders
jen checks her pouch and sees theres not much money left
a large group of giang hu characters enters
they survey the restaurant and quickly find jen upstairs
i am iron arm mi
i heard a true master has arrived
i have come to seek a lesson
jen ignores him
bristles you asked for it
mi charges and attacks jen who is still sitting sipping tea
jen barely lifts a finger and disposes of mi with a poke at a sensitive pressure point
this provokes a reaction from the other men
what kind of iron arm are you
you have amazing technique
i am flying machete
are you related to southern crane
i dont eat anything with two feet
who could remember such long winded names
li mu bai is your defeated foe and you dont know his master southern crane
who are you
im shining phoenix mountain gou
i hate that name
it makes me puke
too bad youre named gou
youll be the first to feel my sword today
jen leaps up and dives into battle
the men all use different kinds of weapons but they all succumb to the powerful green destiny
dont you know monk jing
a monk in a place like this
you need a lesson
who are you
she smiles and leaps again into action after unsheathing the green destiny
who am i
i am the invincible sword goddess
armed with the incredible
be you li or southern crane
lower your head
and ask for mercy
i am the desert dragon
i leave no trace
today i fly over eu mei
ill kick over wudan mountain
jen is in a frenzy slashing and maiming as she speaks
yu and li are surrounded by the variously bandaged men who battled with jen
we politely asked for a friendly match but she showed no respect and attacked us
everyone came by to teach her a lesson
her sword was just too powerful
ive traveled everywhere but never met anyone so uncivilized
heavily bandaged she kept accusing me of being gou jun peis brother
who is this gou anyway
the men all nod their heads
li and yu ride together
to yu were close to your headquarters
go home and check in
what about you
ill look around and catch up later
not a bad idea
tonight well get a good nights sleep at headquarters
yu takes a fork off the road
thunder can be heard in the darkening sky
a group of security men are practicing kung fu in the front yard of sun security
they stop when yu enters
mistress youre back
hows everything here
youve been gone a while
yes and i leave again tomorrow
your wife was due
yeah a baby girl
ill be happy if shes half as strong as you
hows the arm
youve been gone so long
li mu bai is coming to stay the night
excited ill go and make up his room
aunt wu hustles out
yu goes into her own room
yu lights incense for her former fiance meng
hearing something she turns to see a dishevelled jen standing outside downstairs
sister shu lien
yu eases her guard then opens a drawer and takes out some clothes
jen wearing just white underclothing sets herself on the edge of yus bed
yu brings over the clothes
here you must be in proper attire
im just borrowing some clean clothes
im not staying
ill give them to you
i was just passing by and wondered how you were
jen tries to hide her anxiety but finally breaks down on yus shoulder in tears
look at the trouble youve caused
now you know what giang hu life is really like
if you think of me as your sister let me give you some sisterly advice
you can run from marriage but not your parents
they forced me to marry
go back to them first
then you can decide about lo
you know about lo
he really loves you
come back to peking with me
well find a solution
where is he now
li mu bai has made arrangements
he sent him to wudan mountain
youre working together to set me up
how dare you accuse us
i always knew you had stolen the sword
ive done nothing but protect you and your family
and youre repaid me with nothing but contempt
li mu bai himself spared you and all you do is insult him
we wanted some peace and youve ruined it all
youre no sister of mine
what do i care
you were never a real friend anyway
but i wonder how long could you last as my enemy
jen gets up to leave
yu intercepts her
put the sword down
jen jumps out
jen soars out to the front courtyard where the guards are still practicing
they raise their weapons at the sight of an intruder
calling out jen
jen greets yu with the green destiny
shut the doors
the men leave
the friendship is over
yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and begins her battle with jen
yu uses every weapon thats available against jen but none are any match for the green destiny
after slicing through another set of yus weapons jen looks admiringly at the green destiny in her hands
dont touch it
thats li mu bais sword
come and get it if you can
without the green destiny you are nothing
dont be a sore loser
take your pick
yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks
just as the green destiny slices it in half yu holds the broken blade at jens neck
she pauses before hurting jen then pulls back
give me the sword
jen taking advantage of yus trust slices her arm
yu her shoulder bleeding falls back as li mu bai jumps in
enraged stop it
you dont deserve the green destiny
not another lecture
lets end this here
only the sword will settle this
jen soars up to the rooftop with li right on her tail
jen floats over the lake li close behind
jen runs into a sea of bamboo
she appears to have lost li but is not slowing down
her white clothes are now stained with blood and mud
the wind had picked up and every breeze sounds like an air attack by li
the two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin their dances and dodges
they glance off bamboos and each other while staying afloat
finally jen lands on the same stick of bamboo as li
the two hold their positions for a while as the bamboo bends
i only let you go because i wanted to see the real you
jen tries to shake li off the bamboo but li recovers nicely
what do you know about a true heart
li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree
the bamboo straightens up and throws jen toward the ground
jen quickly pulls herself up and charges at li
jen chases after li into a clearing out of the bamboo forest
jen finally catches up to li who is standing on a rock about a few feet wide amid the rapids
jen vaults onto the rock and scuffles with li
jen loses her balance
what do you want
what ive always wanted to teach you
if you can take back the sword in three moves ill go with you
li takes the sword back
give it back
then you have no use for the sword
li throws the sword into the rapids
jen dives in to retrieve it
he follows jen downstream by hopping from one rock to another
jen recovers the sword but is herself drowning
suddenly jade fox swings into the rapids and fishes jen out
jade fox carries the unconscious jen away
li gives chase but loses them
inside an old factory fox heats some medicine paste and then dips a needle in the paste
she burns the needle point causing a blue smoke
she lights some incense and puts it in a burner near jen who is barely conscious
sooner or later theyd drag you back to peking
your parents will never accept you again
but why go home
weve gone this far we wont stop now
youll always be my lady
at last well be our own masters
well be happy
thats the most important thing
all we have left is each other right
lie down and rest
jen is too weak to respond
fox leaves jen clutching the green destiny
fox scurries ahead in the rain
her eyes catch something but she keeps moving
aunt wu finishes bandaging yu
you should have killed her
i didnt have the heart
well li mu bai can do it
yu senses movement at the window
looking out she sees jade fox in the distance
jen wakes up flushed from fever
she takes a sip from a cup of water its empty
she tosses the cup gets up and walks into the rain
jen walks out raises her face into the rain and drinks the raindrops
thirst quenched she turns around and finds li standing there
jen limps towards him while mumbling
is it me or the sword you want
jen falls into li who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes
youve been drugged
li carries her inside kicking away the incense burner
li lays his hands on jens back she slowly comes to
where is jade fox
jen gestures that she doesnt know
yu and bo enter
yu looks at jen
jade fox drugged her
how did you get here
we followed jade fox
instantaneously a flurry of darts flies directly in jens direction
li and yu swipe miraculously at them all sending them flinging hither and thither
fox shows herself
li attacks her
she falls back bleeding to death
and so you die
li touches his neck
and so shall you
li pulls a single needle from his neck
a poisoned needle
you deserve to die but the life i was hoping to take
ten years i devoted to you
but you deceived me
you hid the manuals true meaning
i never improved
but your progress was limitless
you know what poison is
an eight year old girl full of deceit
my only family
my only enemy
jade fox dies
you cant die
tell us what poison you used
you cant die
tell us the antidote
you cant let li mu bai die
she used purple yin
purple yin poison
it goes straight to the heart
my blood will soon reverse its flow
its the same poison she used to kill my master
there is no antidote
that cant be
everything has an antithesis
why not this
the antidote exists
she taught it to me
the formula is simple but it takes time to prepare
as you have helped me let me help you
i will hold on as long as i can
takes the comb from her hair take my horse and go to the compound
give this to mrs
shell help you
spare your energy
ill be back
bo is burying fox in the rain
the guards surround jen
she pushes past them
where is mrs
aunt wu comes running out
jen pulls out yus comb
shu lien told me to show you this
let her in
yu sits across from li whose pose is almost meditational eerily calm
mu bai hold on
give me some hope
save your strength
my life is departing
ive only one breath left
use it to meditate
free yourself from this world as you have been taught
let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath
do not waste it
ive already wasted my whole life
i want to tell you with my last breath
i have always loved you
i would rather be a ghost drifting by your side
as a condemned soul
than enter heaven without you
because of your love
i will never be a lonely spirit
she kisses him lightly
he closes his eyes
as the sun rises jen rides speedily clutching the medicine in her hands
li is in yus arms
theyre holding hands
the sun shines in
yu slowly releases lis stiff fingers he is dead
jen is at the door
bo peeks over jens shoulder
yu rises and picks up green destiny
yu raises the sword but doesnt kill her
please take this sword back to sir te
he takes the sword from her
to jen now you must go to wudan mountain
lo awaits you there
promise me one thing whatever path you take in this life
be true to yourself
jen climbs up toward the temple finally reaching the temple gate and sees lo standing there
he runs to her
she greets him
jen and lo make love
lo wakes up to find the jade comb on the pillow beside him jen gone
lo catches up to jen who stands on a bridge
the gorges below are shrouded in clouds
she looks back at him
do you remember the legend of the young man
a faithful heart makes wishes come true
make a wish lo
closing his eyes to be back in the desert together again
jen smiles turns and leaps into the clouds
they seem to catch her gently before she disappears into them
lo remains standing a smile on his face tears rolling down his cheeks
