thats true love
see glimpses of pats room mayonnaise jar filled with water black trash bag strewn on the bed handwritten sign taped to pats wall excelsior
drinks water opens mouth wide and sticks his tongue out to show he swallowed
yeah thats when i had long hair
people say i talk about my hair too much
and it was just the way i wanted it but he cut it back too far
he cut this side back too far trying to even it up
i didnt tell him to do that
i said just cut it the way you cut it
once you get in the right frame of mind i think anythings possible
i think we get we so often get caught in this state of negativity and its a its a poison like nothing else
pat works out drinks water from his plastic mayo jar does squats sit ups push ups pat looks at the foot then looks up his mother dolores solatano dressed in
technically you can take him out against our recommendation but you assume a lot of liability in the eyes of the court
and hes just getting used to the routine here
i dont want him to get used to the routine here
eight months is already long enough

i dont understand
mom no itll be fine

make on game day when the birds play
danny was in for assault because of crystal meth and alcohol
on top of an anxiety disorder

i had one incident
one incident can change a lifetime
but im ready
im ready to take responsibility for my side of the street
she just needs to take responsibility for hers
are you joking
lets go back to the incident
i come home from work after i
i left work early which i never do by the way but i got in a fight with nancy the high school principal
i come home and whats playing but the song from my wedding
the song that you so charmingly played out here today for us
thats playing and i dont think anything of it
which is odd cause i should have
i come home what do i see
i walk in the door and i see underwear and pieces of clothing and a guys pants with his belt in it and i walk up the stairs and all
ll of a sudden i see the dvd player and on the d
vd player is the cd and its playing our wedding song and then i look down and i see my wifes
panties on the ground and then i look up and i see her naked in the shower
and i think oh thats kinda sweet shes in the shower
what a perfect thing
im gonna find her and maybe ill go in there
fuck in the shower anymore
maybe today we will
pull the curtain back and theres the fucking history
teacher with tenure
and you know what he says to me
you should probably go
thats what he says to me
so yeah i snapped
i almost beat him to death
but now i get fucking chastised for it
im parallel to my father
i dont think so
can you talk about something that you did before or after
yeah about a week before the incident i called the cops and i told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from
the local high school which wasnt true
it was a delusion
and we later found out from the hospital thats because im uh
with mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress which rarely happens thank god
and then the shower incident happened and thats when everything snapped so i then realized that oh wow ive been dealing with this my whole life
and without any supervision ive been doing it all on my own with no help and basically ive been white knuckling it this whole time
that had to be hard
its a lot to deal with especially when you dont know what the hell is happening which i do now

you wanna send him back to baltimore
we know all about the explosion at the psychiatrists office
cliff is lying thats not true
hes not allowed to talk about that
jesus christ whos that

neighbors indistinct chatter continues under following scene and dialogue get outta here you little fuckin idiot

you cant tell nikki about this officer
look i gotta make out a report
she can see it by law
no no no listen sir
hes chasing me
this guys chasing me
i could just write you a letter and you could just let me have five minutes explaining how much better im doing
theres a court order against you five hundred feet

fuckin camera broken over your head
you wa what are you laughing about
go back to sleep
the partys over
this is not a reflection of where im at
please you cant tell her any of this you cant tell nikki about this
you need to pipe down
everything all right
who was at the door
who was that dad
it was that kid with the camera
i gotta write this up
come on dont write it up
i dont want her to see this
its okay everything is okay
were fine thank you we appreciate it
the family stands together in silence
what the hell
what happened to your face
weight lifting accident
that sounds like bullshit
whyd you run by my house
did our little conversation get you upset last night
hey this is my route okay
just back off
this is my neighborhood
you just ran by my house
i like to run by myself okay
stops and turns hey i like to run alone
will you stop
im running here
well then why dont you run somewhere else
theres a fucking ton of roads to run in
what are you trying to do
i like this road
this is my neighborhood
oh come on please
calm down crazy
what the fuck
so am i
what the fuck are you doing
your husbands dead
where is your wife
im not the one that just got out of that hospital in baltimore
im not the big slut
i was a big slut but im not anymore
theres always gonna be a part of me thats sloppy and dirty but i like that with all the other parts of myself
can you say the same about yourself fucker
can you forgive
are you any good at that
you seemed to have trouble last night
let me just set the record straight about last night
hurting my mother was a mistake and i hate myself for it and i hate my illness and i want to control it
my father on the other hand had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night which i did not return cause i couldve killed him and i didnt
hes sixty five years old
you dont think i couldve beat the shit out of him
he was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well
yes last night was a mess
and i think he probably just tried to do his best
pat you have to have a strategy
i told you earlier
you need to recognize these feelings coming to you otherwise you will be sent back to baltimore
so when you get these feelings you need to get to a quieter place and be at peace with yourself however you can
yeah but thats easier said than done
you have to do it
you have no choice
listen i have a letter i want you to give nikki okay
because you have a restraining order
what good are you man
why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night
oh i dont know because im married and i havent seen my wife in eight and a half months
maybe you think that nikkis not around and tiffanys an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards tiffany you will spoil your chances of getting nikki back to you
not bad doctor jones
but i dont think im gonna blow it with nikki because tiffanys a slut
why is she a slut
after the dinner at ronnies she said quote we can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out
and she still wears her wedding ring
so shes a loyal married to a dead guy slut
maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex it will be easier for you to become friends with her
she said shes not a whore anymore but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can i say the same
youre asking me youre really asking me that question
with all my crazy sad shit
what are you fucking nuts
pat the silver lining thing is yours
im just giving back your words to you
this crazy sad shit as you call it made you a happier calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors working out and reading books
no not the books
you said nikkis friends with ronnie veronica and tiffany
so if you become friends with tiffany nikki will think that youre a kind generous large hearted person who helps people in need who is basically thriving
so if you help tiffany it will be good for you
trick or treat
how do you know when i run
i wanted to clarify something
i just want us to be friends
pat doesnt answer did you hear what i said
pat doesnt answer still why are you giving me such a hard time
no im not giving you a hard time
i dont know how to act with you when you do this shit
you wanna have dinner at this diner
pick me up at seven thirty
here you go
im gonna have a bowl of your raisin bran
be right back
you look nice
you want to share this
why did you order raisin bran
why did you order tea
because you ordered raisin bran
i ordered raisin bran because i didnt want there to be any mistaking this for a date
it can still be a date if you order raisin bran
its not a date
so hows your thing going your dancing thing
hows your restraining order
i wouldnt actually call the restraining order my thing but getting back with nikki is and ive been doing pretty well
except for a minor incident at the doctors office
and the so called incident with the weights
that was a thing with my parents
i wish i could just explain it all in a letter to nikki because it was minor and i could just explain it and let her know that im actually
not out of control and that im actually doing really well
i can get a letter to nikki
i see her sometimes with my sister
it would be so amazing if you could get a letter to nikki from me
id have to hide it from veronica
shes not into breaking the law which this letter would definitely be doing
but you would do it
id have to be careful
im already on thin ice with my family you should hear how i lost my job
how did you lose your job
having sex with everybody in the office
i was very depressed after tommy died
it was a lot of people
we dont have to talk about it
how many were there
im not gonna talk about it anymore
can i ask you one more question
were there any women
what was that like
was it like
older women a sexy teacher who wants to made me sit on her lap and do things
you sat on her lap
she told you what to do
nikki hated when i talked like this
made me feel like such a pervert
maybe we should change the subject
i dont mind it
you dont do you
but then people were getting into fights in the parking lot at work and in the bathroom
and the boss called me in to his office and tried to pin it all on me
so i accused him of harassment and then they fired me sent me home and put me on some meds
i get it
the song that was playing when my wife
was in the shower with the history teacher
i heard about that
it was my wedding song and when i hear it i go kinda crazy
sometimes i hear it when its not even playing
so they put me on medication which i feel ashamed of
so i know
i just gotta get a strategy you know
wed better get back to the letter
yeah lets get back to the letter
what if you told nikki when veronica was in the bathroom
yes that could work
i love that
oh my god im gonna go home and write the letter right now
can i at least finish my tea
can i finish it
wait a minute
did veronica tell nikki about our dinner
why would she do that
was it a test
i kinda got that feeling yeah
i knew it
it was a test
how did i do
i think i did pretty well
yeah she said you were cool basically
was i some percentage not cool
no she said you were cool but you know
no i dont know
sort of how you are
its fine relax
what do you mean
how am i
what does that mean
sort of like me
sort of like you
i hope to god she didnt tell nikki that
because its just not right lumping you and i together i mean its just wrong
and nikki wouldnt like that
especially after all the shit you just told me
you think that im crazier than you
because well were different i oh my god
youre killing me
you know what
forget i offered to help you
forget the entire fucking idea
cause that must have been fucking crazy because i am so much crazier than you
keep your voice down
im just the crazy slut with a dead husband
shut the fuck up
you shut the fuck up
diners scattered applause and cheers slow down raisin bran
pedestrians low and indistinct chatter continues under following scenes and dialogue hey come on
look i dont think youre crazy all right
yes you do
no i dont
you told your therapist that you were in a superior mental illness category didnt you
hey calm down
hey just leave me alone
can i just explain myself please
i didnt want nikki to think that i was associated with that kind of sexual behavior because ive never done anything like that okay
you may not have experienced the shit that i did
but you loved hearing about it didnt you
you are afraid to be alive youre afraid to live

youre a conformist

ive been helping pop with the restaurant cause he needs to have a legitimate business
he needs a tax return

and then it looks like im making im gonna make partner at the firm
pat just stares at jake
the room is silent
well i dont even know what to say to you anymore
you lost your wife im getting engaged and i wanna be able to tell you about those kind of things
you lost your house im getting a new house
you lost your job things are going great for me at the firm
maybe stop talking about all the stuff thats good for you and bad for him
just you know leave it alone

pat stares down jake
as my friend danny would say the room hangs on pats words
i got nothing but love for you brother
well thank god finally
did it fit
i wore it to ronnies for dinner
i love that jersey
veronica didnt like it
veronica hates the jersey
whatever you do watch out for that restraining order okay
im not doing anything
dont let tiffany get you in trouble
pat youre up to something i know
people like tiffany or danny or me maybe we know something that you guys dont know okay
did you ever think about that
maybe we understand something because were we have a sixth sense
i mean everybodys got it
everybodys just not in touch with it
how you doing pat
i guess his sixth sense forgot to tell him the cops were coming
im taking him back to the hospital
no no he passed his thing right
first of all check with the latest legal development
well we got a call that they did convert you to a mental hygiene law admission status by the deadline of your sentence so
wait a minute
are you an eagles fan or are you not an eagles fan
im an eagles fan
well then whats the problem
hes not goin anywhere
just let him finish the game thats all
the handkerchief is working
were killing the seahawks twenty seven ten
whats the matter with you
let him stay please
i dont know what the hell youre talking about the handkerchief
and im glad that the seahawks are losing and were winning but i gotta take danny mcdaniels back to baltimore alright
he can contest his case from baltimore
not correct about the mental hygiene law
youre not correct
you guys oughta be ashamed of yourselves
i used the insurance money to build this
i designed it
all the floors are hard oak
it has good bounce for dancers
im not that great of a dancer but who cares
its therapy and its fun
and the walls are good cause i can play music really loud without anybody hearing
where do you sleep
its a garage i just renovated it
you know i was thinking about putting a ballet barre here
when are you gonna give it to her
the letter to nikki
ronnie and veronica and i are gonna see her tonight
oh i actually changed the first paragraph
i did this thing about shakespeare and how its very mm hmm
and that maybe in the future if she wanted to go dancing i can be able to do that because of all the no thats good thats really good
i assume youre a good teacher
i mean i hope so
maybe you can teach us both you know what i mean
and i also mentioned how generous it is what im doing for you
its really generous
you know being of service
to your need
all right lets start simple
start at that corner walk towards me
walk across the room
pat stands in the corner doesnt move
can we do something else besides the dance deal
are you fucking kidding me
im good with a hammer
you want me to fix something
a deal is a deal
i was just suggesting that maybe theres a better scenario
why dont you walk towards me like im nikki
and the only way to convey how much youve missed me is by your walk
by your slow walk
you cant talk
im not doing it
no walk no letter
walk to me like im nikki come on
under his breath youre not nikki
dont look up until youre halfway here
do you feel that
i dont feel anything
has anybody ever told you how tommy died
we were married for three years and five days and i loved him
but for the last couple months i just wasnt into sex at all
it just felt like we were so different and i was depressed
some of that is just me some of it was he wanted me to have kids and i have a hard enough time taking care of myself
i dont think that makes me a criminal
anyway one night after dinner he drove to victorias secret at king of prussia mall and got some lingerie to get something going
and on the way back he stopped on to help a guy with a flat tire and he got hit by a car and killed
and the victorias secret box was still in the front seat
pause thats a feeling
okay this is the waltz
im gonna teach you the waltz step
around her as she showed him his hands on his shoulders
pat lies on bed stares at ceiling emotions churning inside
your father wanted you to have this
he wants me to have all this eagles information
its his living
um tell dad thanks
your father expects to spend time with you pat
football stays out of this place so does lord of the flies
wait wait no no no what are you doing
im behind on my syllabus
i dont give a fuck
what the hell are you doing
did you just throw that outside
youre not gonna read that shit on my time
i can tell you all about the lord of the flies
its a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch they have a shell and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk
and if you dont have the conch then you dont have the power
and then theres a little chubby boy and they call him piggy and theyre really mean and then theres a murder
i mean humanity is just nasty and theres no silver lining
that was a great synopsis
i still need to read it though
laughing what are you doing here man
if one of your two supervising physicians loses their license then your whole ajudication is thrown out
howd you know we were here
i went by your parents house looking for you and they told me you was over here
danny this is tiffany
to tiffany tiffany this is danny
pat told me about you
so is the girl that you wrote about
he wrote about me
im the girl
he wrote about you all right
whatd he say
he said you guys was helping each other out and you were nice and had a mouth on you that you were mouthy but whoa whoa thats enough
no please tell me more about what he said in the letter
yeah anything you wanna know ill just tell you
it was nothing
it was just a very general letter
looks at tiffany shes fine
she is my friend with an f
a capital f
the three stand there awkwardly for a beat
hey can i see what you guys are doing
and then this goes into something else
what is it what is it what is it
can i say something
do you mind
just say it
i think pat you should be facing tiffany
let me show you pat let me show you what i mean
you gotta come at her with a little bit more soul man
you should move more hips
just just sort of come in pat come in like this
can you move em a little bit more
yeah thats it
move em a bit more
you could turn around too theres nothing wrong with that
youre pretty good
okay we got it we got it
come on pat come on
a little bit more soul
black it up pat
black it up
you know damn well what it means
oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute
i got an idea
come get some pat
come get some
shuffle back shuffle back
shuffle back shuffle back
girl you gotta move your junk
i gotta get out of here
i gotta go see this girl tanya
she lives on this side of town
yeah go see tanya
okay man hey
im gonna be there man
i want you guys to win
thats my man
where have you been
we got a serious situation on our hands you know that
pat looks concerned he could be in trouble
we gotta beat the giants if we wanna have a chance of getting into the division any chance of playing in the playoffs
do you realize that
i didnt realize that
yeah thats the bind were in
i mean i think it would be wise if we spent father son time reading about the eagles talking about them just to strengthen the good luck thing that youre
i just wanted to maybe i didnt spend enough time with you growing up
i spent too much time with your brother
it might have made you feel worse about your behavior but i didnt know anything i didnt know how to handle it
i mean thats what all this eagles stuff is about
its about us spending time now
i wanna do everything i can to help you get back on your feet
thats the whole point
i wish youd watch these games with me so we could talk we could get into things
inhales so would you would you just come downstairs and talk to me and randy now
randy tell him what im doing
hes betting everything on the giant game
all the money that he needs for the restaurant hes betting on the giant game
tell him why
because he believes in you
is that true
i believe in you patty
i believe in you
i want you to know that
so im gonna bet heavy on this game
i want you to go to the game with your brother
you want me to go to the game with jake
of course i do
does he want me to go
of course he wants you to go
he told you that
he told me yes
even with all his friends
with all his friends
he trusts you
hes not embarrassed
id love to go to the game too but as you know im banned from the stadium
cause id love to see us beat the giants and take a lot of money from this asshole
listen personally i think its a stupid bet
as a matter of fact i think its ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game
to pat i just hope you heard what i said
its like a family business its our family endeavor
we all stick together on this
thats how it works
thats a positive positive vibe
i made a commitment to tiffany about a project and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on sunday and its good for
its making me disciplined and focused and its its i never wouldve thought this but its a good thing
what is this thing youre doing
yeah what is it
what is this project hon
its a dance thing okay
theres nothing more to it dad
listen i need to ask you something
tomorrow can i spend half the day with you and half the day at the eagles game
im gonna pretend that you didnt just ask me that
these are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move
its not ready yet
and we dont have a move yet
i know but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and i wanna be of service to him okay
and hes worried that the juju from the eagles is being fucked up and hes concerned that its because im spending time with you
oh i messed up the eagles juju
no youre not messing up the juju but the juju is messed up because im not with him during the games
nikki replied to your letter
but you cant read it until after you nail the big move
tiff im sorry
i cant do anything else without reading nikkis letter okay
its just its in the back of my head
we dont almost have it all right
i just hope you can handle it
what was her energy when she gave it to you
she was intrigued excited and a little scared
she was scared
did she tell you
try to stay positive
im just gonna read it out loud okay
because if she says anything thats you know is that too much to ask
i thought you were gonna read it out loud
dear pat it was very emotional for me to get your letter as im sure you can imagine but im glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to
me through tiffany
this gives us a chance to communicate while i keep the restraining order until i feel safe
i must admit you sound terrific and im happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man which i always knew you were
i was moved to read about excelsior and your belief in happy endings
i am also moved by your act of love to read the books i have taught at the high school
im sorry you find them so negative but i disagree
i think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life
in spite of all these positive developments pat i have to say if its me reading the signs i need to see something to prove you are ready to resume
otherwise i find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately
please dont react quickly to this but take time to think about it
im glad youre doing so well
pat folds up the letter again
he is kind of crying
i think im done for today okay
follows him to door she said to show her something pat
this dance can be that something
you would have never done something like this in a million years
it shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels focus collaboration discipline
its romantic like i said it would be
its for her
over his shoulder thanks for the letter
ill see you tomorrow okay
people indistinct chatter continues under following scenes can i use your phone
is it an emergency
yeah kind of
what kind of emergency
well im just doing this project with tiffany and i wanted to tell her im not gonna be on time
just dont make her an emergency that crazy girl you know
shes not crazy ill just borrow jakes phone

you fucking idiot
you spike the ball on the one yard line you fucking idiot
who is this
we need to talk right now
when you make a serious commitment to somebody it is not cool to not show up
wait a second i tried to call my god whats happening i called but i tried to call you tiffany who is this
what is this
i told you i was gonna split my time with my dad and you and my dad was pulling me in one direction
doctor patel ronnie well that sounds great pat
thats great for all of them but all of them didnt make a commitment to me in return for my help
im tiffany by the way
what is this craziness with tiffany maxwell
theres no craziness
i told you who she was i was doing this thing with her
we had a conversation
shes fucking nuts
when you started spending time with her it all fell apart
this is the fucking reason right here
you think i fucked up the eagles juju dont you
ever since ever since he was with you ever since you think that im why todays happened
thats right you are why today happened
im the reason why today happened
i think so
lets talk about that
be my guest
the first night that pat and i met at my sisters the eagles beat the forty niners handily forty to twenty six
the second time we got together we went for a run and the phillies beat the dodgers seven to five in the nlcs
shes right dad
the next time we went for a run the eagles beat the falcons twenty seven to fourteen
the third time we got together we had raisin bran in the diner and the phillies dominated tampa bay in the fourth game of the world series ten to two
let me think about that
wait a minute
well why dont you think about when the eagles beat the seahawks fourteen to seven
he was with you
he was with me
we went for a run
there have been no games since pat and i have been rehearsing every day and if pat had been with me like he was supposed to he wouldnt have gotten
in a fight he wouldnt be in trouble maybe the eagles beat the new york giants
shes making a lot of sense pop
thats all right on all counts
does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of new york is on the official seal of the state of new york
to pat sr
do you know
look it up
not that i give a fuck about football or about your superstitions but if its me reading the signs i dont send the eagles guy whose personal motto is excelsior
to a fucking giants game especially when hes already in a legal situation
how did you know all that stuff
i did my research
well i gotta say im impressed
i gotta rethink this whole thing
i didnt trust it before but i gotta say now i do
oh now you like her dad
i have to say i do
patrizio i feel terrible you know
you made the bet i won a lot of money and now look your whole family is in turmoil
oh fuck off randy
you love it
you live for this shit
youve been betting against my father for years
is that right
youre twisting the knife right now
you get off on it
thats not true
dont say that
you get off on it
if not then prove it
yeah prove it prove it
how do you want me to prove it
hows he gonna prove it
by giving them the chance to win back everything double or nothing
no no no no no no no
double or nothing on the bengals next week
is that what youre saying
she pauses turns dramatically to randy
against the cowboys
thats your team isnt it randy
thats his team
i know who his team is
when is the game
december twenty eight last game of the season
oh my god
same day as the benjamin franklin pairs open freestyle dance competition
randy i thought they were americas team
dont you believe in americas team
yeah randy dont you believe in americas team
yeah i believe in americas team but if i win that bet i win your book youre out of action you get no restaurant no nothing
i like it
i believe in the eagles i believe in my son ill take the action
ill take it
i have faith i have faith
excelsior belongs in this house not in the state of new york
in this house
dad listen to me
i didnt know that excelsior was the state motto of new york okay
i didnt know either but now i know
i know but listen to me this is toxic
dad dad dad this is toxic you shouldnt be doing this you shouldnt be doing randy what do you say to pat be quiet shut up
you already did enough
to randy randy what do you say
my birds benjamin franklins team favored by one and a half points
ill give you three more
patrizio stop it
and randy dont you take the bet
in fact ill give you ten points
you have to take that bet on the cowboys
dolores would you stop him
how could you not take that bet
even with the ten points i give you thats an insane spread to your advantage
cowboys are cowards
and ill bet youre such a coward you wont take the ten
plus are you listening plus whatever their score is at the dance thing
to tiffany whats that
tiffany whats that
no no no no
youre crazy to give away that many points
i wont take that
however wait a second
i do like the idea of a parlay
no dont do it
dont do it
pat how do they run this dance competition
i mean how do they score it and everything
i dont know i dont know how they fucking score
were not were not a part of it
there are people this is a high end dance contest
i dont know
do not put it as part of the parlay randy
they go by the philadelphia rules
each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten ten being the highest
you have to average the four judges scores
okay score is from one to ten right
and you guys are how good
we dont suck
pats a beginner im okay were happy just to be going there
and how are the people youre competing against
some of them are professionals
better than you
tiffany says nothing
a lot better
a lot better
so if i was to say you only have to score five i would be really very generous right
no no that would be amazing if we got five
lets not get away oh come on we can get a five out of ten
gimme a break
gimme me a break
we cant get five
give em a five
give em a five
we can do a five
what are you talking about dad
you havent even seen us dance
thats the parlay
will somebody please explain to me the parlay
you gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing
for pat sr
to win the birds gotta beat the cowboys plus pat and tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance
thats very very manic indeed
thats the parlay
shake on it
you know what
im not gonna be a part of this
to randy randy randy youre a sickness
youre a fucking sickness randy
pat you cant quit
im not doing the dance
pat calm down
thank about it
see you later
what are you doing
here we are again at the one yard line
desean snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
there you go
what does that even mean dad
im not gonna make that that that connection that youre making with desean jackson
it doesnt matter anymore okay
just because i have the fucking jersey on
im not gonna do it
you are not a stand up guy right now
if its me reading the signs
if its me reading the if its you reading the signs
youre reading the signs
you are not a stand up guy
i told you not to push it
yeah but hes gotta do this thing
he cant be a quitter
he cannot be a quitter
you took that stupid parlay thing and now he wont do the dance and it was very constructive for him and you ruined it
theres only one way to get him to show
oh whats that
we have to tell him nikkis gonna be there
they stare at her
she wont come
she cant come
we have to tell him that shes coming
we have to tell him that shes going
but thats a lie
its a white lie
its a white lie whats that matter
thats no big deal
so its a little lie
theres no other way
you know we gotta leave a trail of bread crumbs so that he can live his life without ruining it
i dont approve
you cant do it
well you know i didnt approve when you called her and you told her where he was running so she could ambush him
i didnt approve of that but you did it anyway so im doing this anyway
were gonna tell him nikkill be there
you gotta be part of it
we have to do it
arent you nervous to be lying
a little bit
but its for the best
but if it was me reading the signs
he just figured something out tiffany wrote the letter not nikki
stops and looks back at the house then at the sky he cant believe tiffany lied to him
emotions course through him
hey whats up
sorry im late
he watches her carefully stares at her

she is agitated as he studies her
