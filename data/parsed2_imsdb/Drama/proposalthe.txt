written by pete chiarelli june the sun peeks over the horizon
theres a stunning view of central park from this apartment but whoever lives here isnt watching
as we wander through expensive furniture a steady thump thump thump echoes through the apartment
eventually we see margaret mills running on a treadmill watching the o
on tivo and reading a manuscript
she sprints as the clock on her treadmill goes to zero
as she hits a button to stop the treadmill
a hand knocks an alarm clock off a table to shut it up
richard paxton wakes up on pink sheets and looks around to figure out where he is
there are multiple framed pictures of the same model on the walls
richard looks at the clock and gets up quickly when he sees it is am
unfortunately for him he is very hung over
where are my clothes
a blob beneath the sheets next to him answers
simone is the model on the walls and is really really hot
in the kitchen
can i make you some coffee
sorry i gotta go
richard hurries to the kitchen
socks are on the butcher block next to an empty champagne bottle
shoes in the sink
he finds his pants on the floor and puts them on
richard contd have you seen my belt
simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard
she unties the complicated knot
richard comes back half dressed
he swallows a little throwup
baby i just cant do this anymore
margaret puts on a black suit jacket
definitely not off the rack
she makes sure she looks perfect in the mirror and moves off
reflected in the mirror above simones bed richard hurriedly gets dressed as he talks
youre just too much for me
and im just another guy too wrapped up in his job
richard sits down on the bed and locks eyes with simone
lets not end it like that
its been an amazing three and a half weeks
and you should know that you have the nicest ass ive ever been with
you mean it
i work really hard on it
i know you do
simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her naked body
richard shakes his head no and smiles
richard contd i really gotta go
margaret eats a bowl of kashi and soy milk while standing and reading a manuscript
her eyes remain glued to her reading as she rinses out her bowl and puts it in the dishwasher
her apartment is very quiet
a cab blares its horn at richard as he runs across the street
his suit is rumpled and he checks his watch
the elevator opens and margaret strides towards the exit and the doorman
before margaret gets to the door her cell phone rings
she checks the caller id and excitedly points at her phone as she lets it ring
to phone i knew you would call
now come on tell me what i want to hear
give it to me
you have to put it by your mouth so people can hear you
you should get paid extra for being so darn funny
margaret straightens her jacket answers the phone and walks out the door
margaret contd this is margaret
richard bursts into the skyscraper and runs into a starbucks
two coffees lie in wait for richard
jillian a lovely barista smiles as he hurries to the counter
youre running late today
jillian you are the best
if you think im good at this you should use that coffee cup sometime
as he runs out the door richard glances at his cup and smiles at jillians name and phone number written in sharpie
see ya tomorrow
the elevator doors ahead of richard begin to close
mercifully a hand reaches out and stops the doors
inside the packed elevator richards co workers look sleepy
one particularly frustrated co worker confronts richard
how long is she gonna make us come in by seven
she doesnt exactly consult with me on these things
well this sucks ass
welcome to my nightmare
the doors close as
margaret crosses the street and talks on the phone
youve been thinking about our talk because im right
everyone does publicity
roth mccourt russo
hell chabon practically whores himself
know what they have in common
off answer yes i know you havent done it in twenty years but thats how long its been since youve written a book this good
richard bursts out of the elevator and passes a clock reading and a sign that announces royce publishing
he hauls ass through a sea of cubicles
along the way grumpy employees begrudgingly nod their good mornings
at his desk he pulls a tie out of a drawer and puts it on without looking in the mirror
noticing his wrinkled suit he pulls out a spray bottle out of the same drawer sprays it all over his body and then on his head to help mat down
a tricky cowlick
satisfied he hurries into a nearby corner office
margaret walks into the lobby and continues talking
employees avoid her and pile into the elevator
im not pushing so youll sell more books im pushing because itll be a crime if the world doesnt hear that you wrote a genius piece of literature
do the publicity
margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears yes
margaret contd youre making the right decision
going into an elevator think im going to lose you
margaret hangs up
never give them a chance to change their mind
richard races to margarets computer and turns it on
he picks up papers strewn about the room
he goes back to the computer and opens computer programs
margaret exits the elevator and receives an enthusiastic
margaret quickly walks by and gives only the slightest nod
margaret walks through the cubicles and nods hello to her staff who all look busy on the phone
when she turns the corner they stop their conversations in mid sentence and hang up
richard stares at the printer as a sheet of paper comes out
a clock above the door reads am
the paper clears the printer and richard grabs it quickly
margaret opens the door to her office and finds richard standing at attention with papers in one hand and coffee in the other
her office looks perfect
youve got a conference call in thirty a staff meeting at nine and your immigration lawyer sent some papers for you to sign
cancel the call move the meeting to eight
margaret contd big news i got frank to do publicity
when i want your praise ill ask for it
is bob here
you want him on the phone
were going to his office
grab your pad
richard calmly backs out of the office
but once hes out of margarets sight he runs to his computer and sends an instant message to the office the banshee is headed to bobs office
as the message pops up on computers the quiet office jumps to life as everyone in a cubicle picks up their phone and resumes their imaginary conversations
margaret comes out to richards desk
she notices his coffee cup with jillians number on it
she takes special notice of the hearts that dot the is in jillian
you gonna call her today
richard doesnt know what margaret is talking about until she nods at the cup
are you bored here
do you need little distractions like that to get you through the day
you have another late night out
margaret starts walking
richard quickly catches up worried because he doesnt know where shes going with this
im firing on all cylinders and youve got hearts on your coffee cup wicked bed head and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday
well it wont be wrinkled for long
youll magically unwrinkle
you have magic pants
ive sprayed them with stuff that will take care of the wrinkles
does this work on more than just your pants
anything thats wrinkled
buy me some
richard makes a note
margaret stops to make her point
i dont care what or who you do on your own time but when you walk through that door you represent me and i will not have your personal life
affect you at work
if you want me to think of promoting you to editor i need you sharp focused and professional
now youre just a prop in here so dont say a word
margaret and richard enter bobs office which is decorated with beautiful antiques and first edition books
but unlike margarets office this one isnt in the corner
margaret nods at richard to shut the door
bob wears a prim bow tie circular tortoise shell glasses and the air of superiority
our fearless leader and her liege
im lettin you go bob
what are you talking about
this isnt working out
i asked you repeatedly to get frank to do publicity
you said it was impossible
he doesnt do publicity
i just talked to him
no more buts bob
ive been chief for a month and a half and this is the third time youve dropped the ball
you didnt even call to ask him
all you had to do to was pick up the phone
now ill give you two months to find a new job and then you can say you resigned
i wont tell a soul my lips are sealed
margaret nods at richard and he opens the door
margaret and richard walk a few steps
margaret looks straight ahead and whispers to richard
whats he doing
richard turns around and takes a peek
bob gets out of his chair and comes to his door
hes up and about to pop
oh bob dont do it
the office stops
this is going to be good
margaret turns around with a disappointed look on her face
shes deadly calm
what are you doing
i gave you a civilized way out of this
this is because im your competition
because i threaten you
you could never threaten me
im firing you because youre lazy entitled and incompetent
im firing you because you dont work hard
so if you know whats good for you youll shut up take off that ridiculous bow tie find a bar and get drunk
because if you say one more word richard here is going to call security and have you thrown out on your ass
are we perfectly clear
margaret contd good
now ive got work to do so if youll
margaret and richard walk away and speak in hushed tones
margaret contd we need to call his authors and explain what happened
and get franks publicity schedule figured out pronto
ill just cancel my trip this weekend
i gave you the weekend off
it was my grandmas ninetieth birthday
but no big deal
you were right before i need to stay focused
richard is on the phone with his mom explaining why he cant come home this weekend
he sounds like an annoyed teenager
well tell gammy that im sorry
waiting to speak mom shes making me work this weekend
its not like i volunteered
waiting to speak im sure dad is pissed
margaret comes to richards desk
he tries to wrap it up
richard contd i have to go
no im not going to do that
richard hangs up the phone
richard contd sorry about that
she tell you to quit
off margarets look um
but as ive explained to them after three years together youre the only person on the planet who can make me editor so thats the way it is
richards phone rings and he picks it up
richard contd your is here
who is this guy
he said you knew each other
you werent sure so you told me to set a meeting
we rescheduled on him four times
go get him
but hes out of here in five minutes weve got work to do
margaret leaves and goes into her office
to himself ill charge up the cattle prod
margaret reads as mr
gilbertson sits down
hes an intense man in a bad suit
he sits in silence until margaret looks up
good to see you
i know how busy you are
congrats on the promotion
read about it in p w
well those announcements are silly arent they
like everyone who needs to know doesnt know already
margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man but now gives up
margaret contd have to admit i cant place where we know each other from
he didnt expect her to remember
three years ago
we worked together
dont have it
remember dandelions desire
margaret gets excited
oh my god you read that manuscript with me
that book is legend
without a doubt the worst ever written
it was a fever dream
offensive and pointless pages with like characters who all had some weird disability
the paraplegic pornographer and the stuttering scientist
and there was the asthmatic alien chapter written entirely in his alien language
i believe there was a glossary
margaret laughs caught up in the memory
did you see the pass letter i wrote him
your grammar is impeccable but please do not confuse superior form with writing ability
save your skills for the office newsletter you sir are no writer
margaret says matter of fact
you wrote the book
youre dante dickens
one of my nom de plumes
margaret stays seated at a loss
im sorry if i hurt your feelings
you obviously were spending a lot of time writing i just thought you should channel all that passion into something else
gilbertson smiles as he pulls a badge from his coat pocket
mills im with u
citizenship and immigration services and im deporting you to canada
this is a mistake
ive lived here since
im applying for citizenship
you need citizenship now
after the big promotion
and all the papers are in
gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down
well my office is going to reject your paperwork on monday while we investigate whether your behavior is well disposed to the good order and happiness of the united states
we must protect our sovereignty
im a threat to the sovereignty of the united states
yes and unfortunately my investigation will take awhile so youll be deported while your case winds through the system
as if he doesnt know will it affect you at work if you arent allowed to enter the u
for the next two to three years
affect me at work
ill lose my job
mock sympathy ahhhh
thats a shame
too bad we cant work something out
margaret stops looking at her file
it all becomes clear
no no no
i wont do it
do what ms
ive edited it down
well then get it published at another house
they all just dont get me
well not all
two hundred fifty two hundred sixty one
ill be fired and laughed out of the industry if i publish that book
im at the end of my rope ms
im an author
not some bureaucrat who brings a lunchable to work everyday and lives in his brothers garage
youre the last stop and im desperate
i will never publish your book
theres no need to make this difficult
i dont turn in your file until monday
this is blackmail
ill go to your boss
ive spent two years preparing for this day
dont you think ive thought of that
now margaret is pacing while gilbertson happily looks on
suddenly the door opens and richard bursts in acting like there is an emergency so margaret can end the meeting
excuse me ms
mills risk management needs you right away
the sight of richard inspires margaret
she turns to gilbertson with a wicked grin on her face
know what dante
im not going anywhere
were getting married
richard has no idea what margaret is talking about
whos getting married
you and him
stop playing around honey
margaret is all smiles
richard is very confused
margaret contd mr
gilbertson is from the ins
i told him about us
about us getting married
you are marrying your male secretary
you are marrying your male assistant
matter of fact were in love
we tried to fight it
when its right its right
and this has nothing to do with my visit here today
got it bad
to richard you
is this true
are you marrying this
margaret comes over to richard and holds his hand
of course we are
painfully long beat where richard doesnt answer
margaret squeezes richards hand hard
margaret smiles and snuggles up to richard so he can put his arm around her
richard is truly afraid
richard contd more of a question im uh marrying my boss
margaret turns and puckers her lips to let richard know that shes ready for a kiss
the two slowly begin to come together
just as their dry lips are about to touch richard chickens out and kisses the hair on the top of her head
five years in prison and a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine
if i prove youre lying you go to federal prison for five years
gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes
gilbertson contd to richard you
do you know what youre getting yourself into
were going to put you in a room and ask you every detail that a real couple would know about each other
do you even know her favorite color
richard doesnt answer
margaret encourages him on with a thinly veiled threat
you dont have a choice
richard doesnt want to do this but relents
you mean purple
plum is smokier than purple
but only when theyre in season
childhood pet name
are we done here
who knows youre getting married
with us working together we decided it would be too much of a scandal if anyone knew
have you at least told your family
my parents are dead
so youre not telling anyone that you are getting married
gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad
four questions and ive got enough to send you to prison
were telling his family this weekend
were surprising them
trying to remember at his grandmas th birthday party
and wheres that going to be
no idea at richards parents house
and wheres that located
still no idea in his hometown
is that on long island
only richard has the answer
margaret tries to cover
why dont you tell him
youre going to alaska this weekend
of course were going to alaska
thats where richard is from
gilbertson begins to walk around
hes getting worked up
you think you can beat me with this b s story
forcing your secretary
assistant to marry you and then conveniently telling his family for the first time this weekend
im sorry dante
did you not prepare for that
margaret puts her arm around richard and waits in silence
enraged but with no recourse for now gilbertson checks his appointment book and writes down some information
the ins will see you both in ten days for your official interview
your stories better match up on every account
gilbertson gets right up in margarets face as he gives her the piece of paper
gilbertson contd cross all your ts and dot your is with this ruse ms
there are no ts or is in love mr
gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard
margaret goes back to her desk like this is all in a days work
margaret contd why are you from alaska
sweet jesus thats inconvenient
so heres whats going to happen
well play boyfriend and girlfriend this weekend for your parents and that should be enough for this ins interview
richard doesnt react
margaret doesnt notice
margaret contd so you need to figure out the travel schedule a justice of the peace for next week and get my lawyer on the phone
margaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a face
margaret contd but first run down and get me another coffee from your girlfriend this is cold
margaret holds out her coffee cup
richard doesnt move
margaret contd hello
richard says his first words since gilbertson left
richard leaves margarets office
she still has her coffee cup outstretched in her hand
richard powers through the office
co workers take notice that margaret is following him
richard come back here
margaret tries not to make a scene
margaret contd richard
richard pushes the elevator button in front of reception
margaret contd come back to the office
richard cant take it
he gets up in margarets face
you shut up
you just lost your i get to tell richard what to do privileges
well we need to talk
you want to talk with me
grab your broom and lets go
margaret is dumbstruck
the receptionist is shocked
the elevator arrives and richard gets in
as the doors close richard shouts out to the receptionist
richard contd watch my phones
richard and margaret walk in silence through the park
richard finally speaks
your plan is psychotic
well id rather poke my eyes out than play pretend girlfriend but this is the big time
sometimes you need to sack up
arent canadians supposed to be nice
you wanna be an editor
you need to make
then if we make this happen
youre promoting me to editor
im doing what
we go to alaska and lie to my family
i risk going to jail
well youre making me editor for that
i mean did you think id do this out of the kindness of my heart
you work for me
you know during my employee orientation the hr rep didnt mention anything about me marrying you
look i came to this town alone and with nothing
ive worked my ass off for fifteen years and this guy wants to ruin me because he wrote the shittiest book of all time
nice story little orphan annie but that sounds like your problem
margaret is stuck
richard really does have the upper hand
you take me to alaska this weekend and ill make you editor
margaret puts out her hand to shake richard takes it
margaret contd and im not sleeping on your parents hide a bed were staying in a hotel
do they even have hotels in alaska
but they have huts
and you have to poop in a bucket
but otherwise just like the four seasons
but with bears
a commercial jet takes off and leaves new york city behind
richard and margaret sit in first class and work on their lap tops
richard looks up
shouldnt we talk about what were going to say to my parents
margaret doesnt look up annoyed with the question
are you done with the press release
well lets finish big people business before mommy and daddy talk
dejected richard goes back to work
as they change planes in seattle margaret walks quickly and talks on the phone
still the assistant richard lags behind weighed down by both their bags
up ahead at the gate a gate attendant female s announces final boarding to sitka
margaret gets off her phone
so what do i need to know up there
i told a em weve been dating for six months
weve kept it a secret from everyone
under his breath and that youre a naughty minx in the sack
richard and margaret make it to the attendant at the gate
margaret is not amused by richards attempt at humor
dont make me hate you
margaret hands her boarding pass to the attendant and breezes through
the attendant gives richard a look
bringing her home to meet my folks
tangled in the bags richard struggles to find his boarding pass
the impatient attendant is getting frustrated
richard contd ive got it here
guess im a little flustered too
havent been home for awhile hope they like her
the gate attendant smiles
heard it all i dont care sir
richard finds his boarding pass and hands it over
youre a sweet lady
richard hustles to the plane as they shut the doors
margaret takes her seat and sits next to a well dressed handsome man who is reading a book
she notices the title and he catches her stare
im sorry i hate it when people stare at what im reading
i worked on that book
you wrote it
it was one of my favorites
well you did a good job
you dont see many guys with that book
you uh read a lot of love stories about roman concubines
my ex girlfriend gave it to me
i travel a lot for work
ill read anything
ex girlfriend huh
smiling embarrassed ok you got me
im a closet romantic
but lets keep that between us
margaret smiles and makes the my lips are sealed motion
just then richard lumbers onto the plane with the bags
there you are
give me my lap top
richard untangles the bags and gives margaret her computer bag
re book hey hes reading
i know richard
richard turns around and puts the bags in the overhead compartment
the handsome man turns to margaret
did you two want to sit together
sit together with who
the handsome man nods at richard
margaret points to richard indignantly
you mean him
the handsome man nods
margaret tries to set the record straight
margaret contd no
hes my assistant
youre bringing your assistant all the way to alaska
richard smiles happy that margaret has to answer
oh you can tell him the truth
the handsome man isnt buying it
margaret contd and gay
takes care of me everywhere i go
call him my queen mother
arent you my indispensable gay queen mother
margaret shoots richard a nasty look
he has to go along
richard turns to close the overhead compartment
youre awfully nice to fly him first class
margaret nods her head and agrees
it sucks to be richard
we see the natural beauty of south eastern alaska
sitka is an island the size of maui
only an eight mile stretch of coast is inhabited the rest is complete wilderness
at the center of the island is a mountain with smaller hills around it
the coast is dotted with fishing boats
margaret and the handsome man chat like old friends while they walk off the plane
richard follows with all the bags
as they all walk out of the jetway they see
a big banner that reads congratulations richard and margaret
with wedding bells and a graphic showing the journey from new york to sitka
the banner is being held up by a group of people with excited looks on their faces
richards mom debbie is front and center
shes a sweet lady who cooked richard a hot breakfast every morning until he left the house
grandma annie also waits
shes lived a long time and doesnt have a lot of time to screw around
when they see richard they scream
margarets face drops
there he is
richard blanches white
margaret looks back with eyes that say what the hell is going on
noting banner thats sweet
richard goes over to the group
margaret keeps walking
what are you guys doing here
whats with the sign
so youre just dating huh
i cant believe you didnt tell us
didnt tell you what
were not saying anything until you let us meet margaret
now wheres our girl
richard looks around
margaret keeps her head down and tries to avoid eye contact
you need to come over here
the handsome man sees richard with the banner people calling for margaret to come over
i have to go now
putting it together what kind of sick shit is this
this would be a tough one to explain
have a great life
margaret walks toward the group
richard puts out his hand and silently pleads for margaret to hold it
at the last second she takes it
everyone this is margaret
its nice to meet you
now do you prefer being called margaret or the dragon lady
weve heard it both ways
its not like he hasnt told her that he used to call her the dragon lady
theyre getting married
real casual now ah where did you hear that
the whole getting married thing
oh that man from the government
said he was checking up on you two
said it was technicality because margaret was from canada
what ah did you tell him
well for one thing that you were in a lot of trouble for not telling us that you two were getting married
what did you say
just that you were coming up here this weekend
that we hadnt seen you in a while and that wed heard about margaret for years but that wed never met her
debbie turns to margaret and takes both of her hands
debbie contd contd the way that richard talked about you
ill admit i didnt see this coming
debbie picks up some of the bags and starts walking toward the exit
everyone else follows her lead
so why all the silly secrecy
it wasnt a secret
we didnt tell anyone
well is your family just anyone
no i didnt mean
i should be mad at you two
im just so excited
re group uh is everyone coming to our hotel
oh we cancelled your reservation
youre part of the family now
family doesnt stay at a hotel
also weve got another little surprise for you two
shes not good with surprises
im really not good with surprises
sitka airport is very small so they are already outside by all the cars parked in the loading zone
debbie and annie excitedly look at each other
well you two
youre getting married this weekend
grandma annie contd the whole kit and caboodle
margaret gives both these women a look that says what are you talking about
when gilber something told us you were getting married
god rest their souls
we decided to give you a wedding
engagement party tonight
and the wedding tomorrow at midnight
debbie and annie wait to see what margaret thinks
are you witches
during the solstice its good luck
its an alaskan thing
weve planned everything
margaret isnt sold so grandma annie goes for the clincher
im old margaret
i dont have much time left
richard lives so far away and i never see him
now i find out hes getting married and i have a chance to see my one grandchilds wedding day
its a dream come true for me
a dream come true
please let me see richard get married before i die
richard doesnt know what margaret is going to say
margaret doesnt know what margaret is going to say
finally she goes to speak but can only get out
two big thumbs up
the crowd cheers
a procession of cars makes its way through town
debbie and grandma sit in the front of the truck all smiles
margaret and richard sit as far away from each other as possible in the backseat of the extended cab
margaret tries to get richards attention but hes looking out the window
finally she pinches him and richard jumps
he gives margaret a what did you do that for look
the dragon lady
to tell you the truth we had a lot of the plans made already for my birthday
just a few changes here and there and we made this weekend a wedding
margaret stares at richard
im a lucky woman
margaret does her best to smile
the cars park in a lot in the middle of nowhere near a small dock
everyone gets out of the cars and starts walking to the ocean
margaret is confused
im not getting out of this car until you tell me where were going
come on itll be ok
richard points to a small island about a mile away
everyone rides on a foot yacht
lots of polished wood and chrome
someone passes out beers on board and the mood is festive
margaret takes a look around at the surreal scene
who are you people
richard lets margaret wonder
the ship docks and we get our first glimpse of the paxton estate
it sits above the rest of the wooded island and is as tasteful as a bedroom alaskan mansion can be
richards father geoffrey waits on the dock
he is a bear
so you must be margaret
weve heard a lot about you
all of it bad
margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in her none to practical sling backs
geoffrey contd i mean i almost shit myself when i heard he was marrying the devil woman
i thought it was the dragon lady
richard shakes his fathers hand
its a little stiff
good to see a ya
been a while
youd think you could make it to the airport to mark the occasion
grandma annie interrupts
help him with the bags geoffrey
to richard and margaret lets get you two settled
as richard and margaret move towards the house annie shoots geoffrey a look that says be nice
the house is decked out in sheik alaskan decor
somehow it makes bear heads and deer antlers look good
everything is first class
margaret is a little awe struck
well show you around later
out of nowhere a small husky puppy startles margaret and jumps on her
debbie pulls the dog off of margaret and pushes him toward the kitchen
margaret tries to take it in stride and make small talk
what a great name
balzacs lost illusions is one of my favorite novels
well this balzacs got epididymitis
debbie makes two big circles with her pointer fingers to illustrate how balzac really got his name
not understanding margaret looks over at balzac as he walks away
off her shocked reaction we understand right away that this puppy husky is an anatomic marvel
debbie contd no one on the island wanted him when he was born
we figured he deserved a home
and dont let him outside or the eagles will snatch him
i mean it
they come out of that rehabilitation center mean
dont listen to him margaret
debbie opens a door for richard and margaret
youll be sleeping here
the room is beautiful right out of architectural digest
bathroom is there all the towels are in the armoire by the bed
just let me know if you
wheres richards room
oh we took down his shrine years ago
and dont worry im under no illusion that you two havent slept in the same bed before
richard can sleep here too
oh lets not upset grandma annie
it was her idea
anything to help get her a great grandchild
richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother
you know ive gotten used to his breathing at night
i thought so dear
debbie leaves and shuts the door
margaret reverts back to her old self
im about seconds from bitch
what is going on here
hell if i know
you had no idea they knew about us getting married
you think id bring you here if i did
well we just gotta tell a em
tell a em what
tell a em the truth
what do you mean no way
this is crazy
no crazy was lying to the federal officer
well i dont like this
well im not making my gammy an accomplice to a class c felony
for one second could you not be so selfish
yeah you know that thing you do where you only worry about yourself every second of every day
how is it selfish to tell the truth
were awful awful people
in the last forty eight hours weve lied to
we need to protect the people downstairs
we cant ask these good decent not awful people to lie for us
lets keep the darkside to ourselves
margaret takes a second to make up her mind
but if we do this you need to stop lying to me
whatve i lied to you about
why did you tell me that you were poor
i never said that
well you never told me you were rich
when does that come up
i dont know how about hi my name is richard im an alaskan titan of industry
well maybe i didnt tell you because you would have fired me if you knew
no i wouldnt
youre always yammering on about your scrappy childhood and how you fought for those soccer scholarships and how the rich kids made fun of you in prep school for working
in the kitchen
youre totally anti rich
im not anti rich
oh yes you are
and you know what makes it worse
you have money
every penny i have
blah blah blah
you need new material
youre still my assistant
you were going to promote me anyway
sure of that
not at all
margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror
well come on
if were going to do this we might as well put on a show
downstairs the engagement party is in full swing
the starched wait staff stands out in the crowd because the raucous party goers are all dressed in flannel t shirts and baseball hats
ponytails rule for the women and almost all the men have shaggy hair and beards
no dress code here
like the house the party is first class
ice sculptures melt champagne is served on silver trays and the buffet overflows with salmon and king crab
margaret works the crowd like a pro and holds court with some well wishers richards parents and balzac
i went to union college in upstate new york
its a small liberal arts school that no one has ever heard of
richard comes to the group and hands margaret a drink
margaret contd looks at glass lime
be right back
richard leaves to fetch lime wedges
geoffrey elbows debbie in the side what was that
how long have you been with your company
since i graduated college
richard comes back with the lime
margaret takes it and doesnt say thank you
shes been there since she was nineteen
thats how long
oh whos counting
geoffrey could let it go but wants to push her
how many years is that
margaret gives geoffrey the slightest look
well let me see
that would be sixteen or seventeen years
i was never good with big numbers
that makes you
thirty six now

born on may th
im a taurus
geoffrey and margaret give each other a smile
margaret contd to richard i need some protein

margaret shakes her head no
richard contd crab
margaret nods yes
richard steps away to find a waiter
geoffrey watches his son do margarets bidding
keep him on a short leash huh
does he roll over when you whistle
debbie hits geoffrey
hes just being a good host
richard comes right back with a waiter in tow
for geoffreys benefit margaret makes a point to thank richard
thank you honey
youre being so sweet
richard is surprised but remembers theyre a couple
so you just got some big promotion
im editor in chief now
richard tenderly puts his arm around margaret
im so proud of my girl
from behind them a melodic etherial voice interrupts
editor in chief
youre marrying up richard
everyone turns around to find gertrude thurman
she is grace kelly in patagonia and timberland
adding insult to injury she doesnt have eyeliner on
richard snaps his arm back hitting margaret in the head and spilling her tonic water on her shirt
he doesnt notice what hes done and leaves margaret
richard contd what are you
what are you doing here
your dad made me come
the group watches these two see each for the first time in years
there is instant chemistry and richard has forgotten about margaret completely
i live here now
i moved back about six months ago
im teaching second grade
did your husband move up here too
i ah got divorced
oh my god
but hey were being rude i wanna meet the bride
gertrude leaves richard and goes to margaret
gertrude contd hi im gertrude
but call me gert
youre a gertrude
a family name from hell
im sure its been a curse
gert and richard were quite the item in high school
gertrude instantly dismisses geoffreys reminiscence
feels like yesterday to me
ignoring geoffrey so tell me everything
i hear it wasnt exactly love at first sight
now richard what i want to know is how you proposed
this grabs the groups full attention
everyone loves to hear a story like this
richard hasnt recovered from seeing gertrude
richard contd uh uh um i
how did you pop the question
richard is a deer in the headlights
this is getting ugly
margaret sees that richard is going to crumble and steps in
can i tell this one honey
im an early early riser and go for a run everyday
well it was our six month anniversary and i was out for my normal jog in the park when who do i see in a horse drawn carriage wearing a
tux and waiting for me halfway through my run
so i ran up to the carriage and asked him what was going on and he put his finger to his lips and says shhhh
so there i am in my jogging clothes next to the most handsome mute in the world have you seen him in a tux
riding like a sweaty princess and smiling ear to ear
couple minutes later we arrive at tavern on the green
best part were the only people in the place because richard got them to open up early
well we go to our table sit down and just as the sun starts to peek above the trees this beautiful man gets down on one knee and says i
didnt want one more sunrise to go by without you knowing that you are the light of my life and that i would be the luckiest man in the world if you would be my wife
margaret mary mills will you marry me
the group is silent waiting for the clincher
margaret contd i said yes
the group gives a collective ahh
grandma annie takes both margaret and richard by the hand
you are a good boy richard and you make me very proud
i love you richy
i love you too grandma
grandma hugs the couple
everyone smiles except geoffrey and gertrude
so did this happen before or after the ins agent came sniffing around
what is wrong with you
im sorry margaret
margaret doesnt miss a beat
id wonder too
honestly my lawyers have been dealing with all of this
when you told us at the airport it was the first time id heard about it
im so embarrassed
dont be dear
geoffreys just an ass
while debbie apologizes margaret gives richard a little wink that says ive got this under control
the moment is interrupted when richard pulls out a ringing cell phone
he takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear
margaret mills phone
off answer one second please
richard comes back to the group and hands margaret the phone
richard contd its our friend frank
richards tone lets margaret know theres a problem
excuse me ill just be a second
margaret takes the phone and exits out french glass doors that lead to the backyard
she leaves the door open and doesnt notice balzac follow her outside
margaret goes far from the house so no one can hear
balzac follows her all the way but margaret doesnt see him
dont be a cliche frank
dont be the wishy washy writer who changes his mind every two seconds
margaret notices balzac but ignores him
the dog starts yapping to get attention
she walks away but balzac continues barking
annoyed she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the phone against her chest so frank doesnt hear
margaret contd to balzac sit and be quiet
balzac sits and pouts
margaret walks away and puts the phone back to her ear
margaret contd i fired bob because he didnt have your best interest in mind
our job is to help you succeed
he wasnt doing that
margaret continues to listen to her writer whine when she notices an eagle soaring in circles above her and balzac
not sure what to think she looks back at balzac and sees him peacefully sit in the grass
she then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone
margaret shakes her head looks back at balzac when whoosh
the eagle snatches balzac by the scruff of the neck and takes off
there is no one to help so she chases after the dog and eagle
she stays calm on the phone
margaret contd could you hold on just a second
with no other option margaret throws her cell phone and hits the eagle suspended feet above her
the eagle drops balzac and margaret catches him
balzac looks frightened
tucking balzac away like a furry football she runs to her phone and picks it up
margaret contd sorry dropped my phone
margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in circles above her
she decides to wrap up the call quick and get back to the house
margaret contd frank i dont want to sell you on anything
but know this
this book is your legacy
margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and balzac again
margaret contd and i think you should be the one to introduce your legacy to the world
call me tomorrow with your decision
my phone is always on
talk to you soon
the eagle bears down on them with talons out
just as the eagle is about to strike margaret sticks out her hand with the phone to fend back the eagle
to her surprise the eagle grabs margarets phone and flies off
panicked she takes balzac in both hands and puts him up to the eagle as an offering
margaret contd take the dog
take the dog
inside the elegant party carries on
we need to go
its a surprise
girls are going into town
and the boys stay here
i told you weve planned everything
debbie and richard turn around and look out a picture window
they see margaret running with balzac above her head
oh thats sweet shes playing with my balzac
the eagle is long gone but margaret is still running with the dog trying to bait it back
this is a delicious dog mr
cmon bring back the phone
richard calls out from the house
what are you doing
the eagle took my phone
are you drunk
your dad was right
the eagle tried to take the dog so i saved it then it came back and took my phone
did the dingo eat your baby too
franks going to call me on that phone
i need it
ive got your information backed up on the laptop
ill just get you a new phone and switch the number
now come on
youre going somewhere with my mom and the girls
im not going anywhere

the pioneer bar is a classic alaskan bar decorated with pictures of every fishing vessel that has made sitka its home
but tonight estrogen rules as all the patrons are women cheering for an oiled toned and bearded man in a tiny thong who gyrates to the beat of princes sexy
on stage with the dancer margaret tries to not look miserable in her novelty work it hank
is that a salmon down your pants
the room laughs as hank works his crotch millimeters away from margarets face
margaret remains straight faced
definitely not a salmon
the women encourage hank on as he moves margarets hands to his wiggling ass and gives her a feel
she cant help but give and embarrassed smile
finally the song ends and hank goes into the splits
thrilled the room gives him a standing ovation
margaret plays along and gives hank a kiss on the cheek
she begins to get off the stage but hank takes her by the hand
ah ah ah
i was just the warm up
hank sits margaret down and blindfolds her with a scarf
whats going on
just sit there dear
dont be shy ladies tip well and often show hank how much you appreciate his assets
the room goes silent as a middle aged ramone comes on to the stage
he has a pot belly threadbare thong and a thin mustache
ramones dance has a latin theme to it and hes very good at it
margaret is oblivious
whats that smell
margaret finally takes off her blindfold and finds ramone about an inch away from her face
margaret contd belly laugh ahhh
margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens ramone
after the initial scare he composes himself and wags his finger at her naughty behavior
you are a naughty devil
ramone goes to work another part of the stage and when he turns margaret jumps off the stage and joins the ladies
ramone was the only male dancer on the island for years
no one has the heart to tell him to hang it up
want me to do it
thank you dear but lets keep it our secret
snow capped mountains watch men in short sleeves hit golf balls into the ocean
green pontoon rafts bob in the water made up to look like golf greens
golf balls are stacked in pyramid formations at every hitting area
richard comes down from the house to join the group
geoffrey jokes with mr
maguire s good natured as they hit balls
yeah debbie found these eco balls that dissolve in the water
how does she come up with this shit
she just does
i stopped trying to figure out how
geoffrey and mr
maguire see richard coming their way
maguire yells at richard like the old family friend he is
im mad at you son
whys that mr
you fly up here and dont call me
sorry a bout that
what good is me owning an airline if i cant give you free tickets
dont know what i was thinking
dont let it happen again
hands richard a golf club here you take over
this game is for pussies im getting a drink
maguire leaves and richard and geoffrey are left alone with one another for the first time
things are awkward between father and son and richard begins hitting balls to avoid conversation
geoffrey finally makes small talk
maguires stepping down in january
hes uh handing things over to matty
richard gives his dad a look
he knows where this is going
thats great for them
hows work with you
hey did i tell you that were opening a little office in japan
were not just a mom and pop operation anymore
were going global
geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second
hes been thinking about this moment for a long time
i could really use your help
im in new york
margarets in new york
we have jobs
its just what
youre only a secretary
this pisses richard off immediately
again with the secretary thing
ive told you im an assistant
just because you call yourself an assistant doesnt mean youre not really just a secretary
well if im just a secretary why would you want me up here anyway
sounds like youre doing great without me
its not like that and you know it
then how is it
explain it to me
geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening
last week a man stuck his finger up my butt
this man was a doctor
and it got me thinking about you
im not sure this is coming out right
just shut up for a second okay
i want you to have what i built
but im running out of time to show you things
stop being so dramatic
im not being
takes a hard line i need you to stop dicking around down there and get serious
so this is all about what you want
thats not what i said
and me in new york with margaret
that isnt serious
one day the woman is the antichrist and the next day shes the love of your life
how is that serious
things change dad
thats your explanation
know what i think
i think you banged your boss and fell in love thats what i think
some sorta mommy complex
we gotta have these cosby moments more often
this is great
richard drops his club and walks back to the house
margaret steps outside to have a moment to herself
shes on a patio overlooking the ocean
it is late but the sun is hanging just over the horizon
they can be a little overwhelming but theyre great people
im just working on my tan
off gertrudes look its been a long day
margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still raging
around the solstice they dont watch the clock
pretty much party a til they fall over
i actually missed it when i was in the states
and now youre back
six months now
call me crazy but i love it
think im back for good
i dont know
dont you miss
she likes this woman
gertrude contd yeah
i miss it
believe me growing up i never thought id end up divorced and back here teaching at my old elementary school
that was always richards plan
for you to get divorced
smiles remembering no
i was going to teach he was going to run his dads business
he was like a little old man
had it all worked out
are we talking about the same guy
what do you mean
well richards such a player
gertrude looks confused
margaret contd i mean he was a total player
before we started dating
six months ago
that surprises you
did he ever tell you why we broke up
we dont really talk much about stuff like that
well i should shut up
i mean we are getting married
i want to know these things
gertrude looks down a little embarrassed
he proposed to me
when we were seniors
i didnt mean to
he proposed to you in high school
he bought this sweet little ring and got down on his knee
it was so cute
you must have
oh you bet
i broke up with him on the spot
i would hope so
after getting rejected the first time i cant imagine how hard it was for him to get up the courage to ask you
margaret just smiles feeling guilty about lying when gertrude is being so honest with her
gertrude contd anyway
the idea that my little old man could be a player
its just not the richard i knew
good thing youre making an honest man of him again
gertrude toasts margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in one swig
she has a hard time finishing it off
gertrude contd well im empty
im going to go get another
i think i hear ramone wrapping up lets get back to the girls
ill be right in
margaret smiles and turns to the ocean
gertrude goes inside
then to herself margaret silently whispers
margaret contd we are awful people
an axe slams down and splits a log in two
hands quickly place another log down and thwack
we pull back to find richard playing the role of executioner
hes still mad after talking to his dad and is taking it out on the firewood
rage against the machine plays on his ipod and hes in his own world
behind him the girls return to the island on the family yacht
their mood is light and they chat amongst themselves
debbies mood deflates when she sees richard
is everything ok
with his back to the girls and the ipod on richard doesnt hear or see the girls
annie shakes her head
something is up
geoffrey pets balzac as he watches sportscenter on a sixty inch plasma television
the ladies arrive and annie and debbie step in front of the tv blocking his view
margaret watches from the door not sure what is going on
im watching that
why is richard chopping wood
and dont play dumb
what did you do
geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of margaret
i didnt do anything
will you please move
the showdown intensifies
margaret excuses herself
i am so tired
balzac growls when he hears margarets voice
hes still mad
margaret just smiles
margaret contd think im going to take a shower and clean off ramones bubble gum body oil
thanks for a great night
annie and debbie smile graciously and wish her good night
once shes gone they turn their death stare back to geoffrey
he looks genuinely unnerved
stop looking at me like that
richard continues to listen to his ipod and has worked up quite a sweat
hes stacks the last log takes off his soaked through shirt and gets a whiff of himself
margaret walks into the private bathroom attached to her room and shuts the door
we hear her turn on the shower
geoffrey defends himself to debbie and annie with great conviction
richard walks right by the fighting trio but doesnt notice anyone
he continues to listen to his ipod and his attention is focused on the controls as he looks for the playlist songs i shouldnt like and charlenes hit ive been
to paradise but i havent been to me
margaret turns off the shower pulls back the curtain and reaches for a towel
all she finds is a miniature unabsorbent decorative hand towel
richard enters the room smiling as charlene sings
ive been undressed by kings and ive seen some things that a woman aint
margarets ears perk up
the bathroom is a disaster because she has dripped water everywhere looking for a towel
richard is that you
richard opens the armoire next to the bed and pulls out an incredibly absorbent egyptian cotton towel
margaret cracks the door open to see what the sound was
richard isnt there but she sees the armoire open and the towels waiting for her
how did she miss that
richard are you
then out of nowhere balzac he followed richard in startles margaret
yap yap yap yap yap
margaret slips on the wet floor and falls on her ass
her foot kicks the door open as she retreats from the vengeful puppy
richard is oblivious as he hangs his wet clothes over a rail on the deck attached to the room
he makes sure that no one is in the yard pulls down his shorts and hangs them up as well
naked wet and starting to get a little pissed off margaret manages to pull herself up by the toilet
she wants a towel badly but balzac guards the doorway
she tries reason
im sorry bout the eagle
but i saved you
balzac wont listen to reason and barks angrily
margaret grabs the ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself
richard calmly turns around and sees that the bathroom door is open
margaret holds the top of the toilet tank like a baseball bat ready to strike
balzac will not be intimidated and continues to growl and not let her out of the bathroom
margaret knows that she cant hit a dog and looks for another way out
then she spots the bathroom mat
richard saunters towards the bathroom wearing only his ipod
balzac puts a paw onto the bath mat
margaret slowly puts back the toilet top
balzac gets to the center of the bath mat and margaret pulls hard sliding the bath mat and balzac to the back of the bathroom
with balzac out of the way she runs out closes the door behind her and
margaret crashes into richard and they fall to the floor
it takes a second for them to realize that they are holding each other buck naked
the two quickly separate and spastically try to cover up
a rapid fire back and forth ensues
why are you naked
why are you wet
dont look at me
you tackled me
it was the dog
youre blaming the dog again
will you just hand me a towel
richard looks for a towel but forgets hes naked
when he looks under the bed margaret shrieks and covers her eyes
margaret contd youre flashing brain
richard quickly changes positions
out of desperation he pulls the entire comforter off the bed
he throws it margarets way and she wraps herself in it
margaret contd you can cover up any time
richard cups the beans and franks and backs up to his clothes by the window
margaret contd explain yourself
i didnt know you were home
i was outside chopping wood
you didnt hear me
i had my ipod on
why did you jump me
richard reaches his clothes and pulls on his shorts
i didnt jump you
off richards look i didnt mean to jump you
i didnt know you were here
you didnt see me
i was running from the dog
richard looks at margaret suspiciously
were you tryin to seduce me
dont flatter yourself
go take a shower
but dont come sneaking in there
youre still my boss
thatd be sexual harassment
richard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door
margaret takes a breath but is startled when the door suddenly opens back up again
richard has balzac cradled in his arms and scratches his neck
he gently puts him outside their room
richard contd there you go buddy
go on and play before she makes a coat out of you
richard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom
without looking back richard gets the final shot
richard contd puppy hater
richard grabs all the pillows cushions and blankets he can find to create himself makeshift bed on the floor
margaret turns out the lights leaving the room still bright with the sun still shining outside
she gets into her bed
im never gonna to get to sleep
richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down outside the window
the sunlight is instantly blocked out and the room is pitch black
margaret contd oh
richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed
the two silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling
it was kinda weird seeing you naked
can we not talk about this
im just saying
it was weird
it wasnt weird
how was that not weird
were like teammates
we are teammates
and teammates see each other naked in the locker room
all the time
its not a big deal
well if were teammates can i sleep in the bed
good night richard
the two lay awake in silence for another beat
dont take this the wrong way
youre a very beautiful woman
margaret smiles with her head turned away from richard
get some sleep richard big day tomorrow
not a creature is stirring except for geoffrey who creeps into his office
he shuts the door softly and goes to his gigantic oak desk
he finds a phone number with a new york city area code on a piece of paper
my name is geoffrey paxton
only the animal trophies that adorn geoffreys office hear the rest of the conversation
margaret wakes up
she looks over to richard asleep on the floor with a blanket and a pillow
she stares maybe a beat too long before there is a knock on the door
who is it
its me dear
i made you two breakfast in bed
can i come in
just a second
margaret cant yell at richard so she throws a model wooden sailboat to wake him up
she hits him in the head
richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his makeshift bed
he finishes quickly hops in the bed and puts his arm around margaret
come on in mom
debbie enters with a tray of pastries fruit and coffee
richard contd ah mom you made your cinnamon rolls
well its your special day
debbie smiles puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on the edge of the bed
she is buzzing with excitement
debbie contd you two need your energy so eat up
weve got your dress fitting have to get the house ready and then your wedding
i gotta run into town to get margaret a new phone
will you pick up some champagne while youre there
and dont be gone for too long
lots of work to be done
you dont have to go to all this trouble
debbie sweetly looks back at margaret
dont be silly
this is the biggest day of your life
you are coming into this family and when its family its no trouble
if your parents were with us they would do the exact same
debbie leaves and margaret smiles as the door closes
richard jumps out of bed and goes to the food
your mom is just so sweet
i havent had someone make me breakfast in bed since i was a little kid
richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll
mouth full i wish she hadnt
i mean she almost caught us
damn that was close
like a pig in shit richard continues to dig in and doesnt pay attention to margaret
you just take all this for granted
your family this house
richard takes another big bite and turns to margaret
mouth full im sorry what
you gotta try these
margaret looks at richard with disgust
why are you doing this to them
why am i here
you didnt have to bring me here
you made me bring you here
you told me i
i didnt make you do anything
you could of said no
start over at the bottom again
i get why a not rich person would do this
but youve got everything
it doesnt make any sense
this is none of your business
i wish it wasnt my business
but unfortunately it has become my business because i made a deal with someone i thought i could trust
richard stares at margaret for a beat
you wanna know why youre here
ill show you why youre here
we leave in a half hour
ill be ready in minutes
margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it down on the plate
she goes to her suitcase and looks for clothes
a beat passes and she comes back to the rolls
margaret contd these are really good
she takes a cinnamon roll and leaves
richard and margaret board the yacht
they wear athletic clothes and running shoes
richard drives the yacht and margaret sits by herself
richard docks the boat at the paxton seafood pier
located in the towns harbor the packing plant consists of three large warehouses and buzzes with activity
fishing boats line the pier unload their fish and forklifts take the fish to be processed
everything is clean and organized
richard and margaret walk down the pier
he points to the seals that swim everywhere and eat fish scraps
damn theyre cute
richard waves hello to workers
an elderly phillipino man bek bek yells at them as he walks into a warehouse
that the lucky lady
yes sir it is
to margaret you look much younger than everyone says
thats great to hear
see ya on the line bek bek
richard opens a locker and points
we dont see at what
put this on
ill meet you outside
but i dont
put it on
margaret opens the door with a sour look on her face
shes wearing large green hip waders with suspenders rubber fishing boots and gloves
is this really necessary
youll thank me later
richard walks towards the warehouse
margaret follows in her
inside one of the brightly lit warehouses workers at different stations process the fish that come off the boats
at the top of the line bek bek is handcuffed to the head decapitator machine
he happily feeds whole salmon into a guillotine where the heads are chopped off
he awkwardly waves when he sees margaret and richard
why is he handcuffed to the machine
so his hands dont go too far
so he doesnt
richard makes a chopping motion
from the decapitator fish are fed into the gut puller where their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out
margaret contd you know i shouldnt be here
i was a vegetarian for six months in college
richard leads margaret to the end of slime line where a long line of workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are frozen
with great speed they take the fish from the gut puller line and clean out all the left over intestines
there he is
big city boy come to show us how its done
ah its been a while
show her how we do it
richard and margaret go to the end of the line
richard expertly demonstrates with a knife
richard contd you grab a fish but be gentle cause you dont want to bruise it
open her up tilt the knife and then pull with the grain of the fish
two quick stokes to clear the organs attached to the spine
margaret looks nauseous
richard enjoys her discomfort
richard contd then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the blood out of the vein
then send her down the line
richard guts another fish with precision and speed before offering a knife to margaret
richard contd wanna try it
margaret doesnt say anything
all the other workers watch
richard contd if its too gross for you
up to the challenge she takes the knife and grabs a fish
margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible between her and the salmon
i did this for five summers
dad wanted me to earn my stripes before i took over
is that why youre still pissed at him
nah i loved it here
re fish guts you loved this
the slime line
nobody loves the slime line
i loved this place
growing up running this place was all i wanted
margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish
you wanted this
i wanted to run this place
it was comfortable here
it was what i knew
re fish dont forget the spine
i wasnt gonna forget
margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein sends the fish on its way and grabs another fish with more confidence
but then things changed
and it wasnt so comfortable anymore
what kind of things changed
as if she didnt know you mean like gertrude
richard stops he can tell margaret knows something
richard contd oh my god
she told you didnt she
told me what
richard is embarrassed
he turns away
the creepy teenage proposal
you were a freak by the way
ok get it all out
and she was right to break up with you
margaret nods yes
richard contd i know now that it was the right thing but it screwed me up for a little while
for a little while
dont sell yourself short
when gert crushed my heart into little pieces a life up here didnt seem so great anymore
so you moved to the open arms of new york city
at first it was about getting as far away from this place as possible but then i fell in love with it
with scheduling my pilates
see as an only kid id always read a lot but until i worked for you i didnt love it
i mean when i realized that we could find the next cuckoos nest or catch or
with reverence to kill a mockingbird
its all about to kill a mockingbird
we could find the next to kill a mockingbird
god damn how great is that
she never knew that richard had this kind of passion for the job
richard contd so when i tell my folks that i want to spend my life finding books
my dad goes ape shit
how dare you forsake your family
youll come crawling back to us
youre nothing without our help
i left that night and we didnt talk for a year
havent been back here since
so were getting married so you can give daddy the finger
margaret gives richard a disbelieving look
richard contd sorta
coming back here with you
i get the promotion and i get to show off
youre editor in chief
you make a good prop
i guess thats a compliment
so now you know im a petty asshole
am i trustworthy again
oh yeah were good
by the way youre more screwed up than i am paxton
one more question
yes everyone at work thinks youre a lesbian
that wasnt my question
just lashing out
can we stop gutting fish
i need my phone
richard and margaret enter the well appointed general store filled with food booze and electronics
a mini wal mart
hola mi amo
margaret recognizes ramone the male dancer from last night
they walk a few steps and before margaret can say a word
margaret contd you know him
he was my shop teacher
of course he was
how many people are on this island
they start to fill their cart with cases of champagne
like eight thousand
depends on the time of the year
with the cart full they head to the checkout
to ramone you got the phone i called about
charged up ready to go number changed
ramone throws richard a phone
ramone gives margaret a flirty wave
she awkwardly waves back
richard pushes the cart out the front door and does not pay
margaret is confused
richard keeps pushing the cart margaret catches up
whys ramone letting you steal his stuff
its our stuff
richard points to the paxton general store sign
that must have been handy in high school
you have no idea
should you leave the cart
its our cart
i didnt know you were such a prude
ive come to realize that being my assistant gave you more access to my life than i ever imagined but there are a few things you dont know about me
i doubt it
when i started you were still wearing those ugg boot things
deadly serious i told you never to talk about that
im just saying its been a long time
i know it all
margaret turns on her new phone
it searches for a signal
up to the challenge did you know i took disco lessons in the sixth grade
uh my first concert was kool and the gang
i won tickets on the radio and saw them at the fair
whatd they sing again
cherish the love we have we should cherish the life we live
richard shakes his head
margaret contd well they were good

i really like it
im getting shut out here
allergic to pine nuts
afraid of penguins
havent slept with a man in a year and a half
you are a lesbian
a mother walking by with her year old gives richard a nasty look
richard contd to mother my bad
the mother walks on
margaret is mortified and walks faster
kool and the gang gets nothing but that gets a holy shit
ive been busy
thats a really long time
that hurts coming from mr
i knew it had been slow going but i figured there was a booty call in there somewhere
yeah well im not good at that
i find that hard to believe
no not that
im great at that
ill have to take your word for it
how exactly do you define top notch
margaret is smiling as she listens to a message on her phone
in an instant shes all business
i need a computer and the internet
designed to attract tourists the fishermans net is awash in bad nautical props and fishing gear
a bored teenage clerk in a pirate outfit greets margaret and richard
aye lassie welcome to the cyber seas
our t line is faster than a clipper ship in a hurricane but for now ye be needing to scrawl your mark on this sign up sheet
margaret looks and sees that all the computers are taken
no no no
i need on now
ive got a booker prize winning author demanding i send him an e mail in the next forty five minutes explaining why he should stay with a publishing house that
makes him do publicity
the pirate looks at margaret like shes speaking chinese
listen to me asshole
the pirate looks around to make sure his boss cant hear
you gonna put your name down on the list or not
margaret is about to throttle the pirate when richard pulls her back
i got an idea
richard leads margaret to the door
as they are leaving margaret shouts out
i didnt know there were a lot of pirates in alaska
margaret sits at a computer furiously opening her e mail
richard has brought her to his elementary school where he and his old principal mrs
whiting stand over margaret
im so excited about the wedding
thanks for letting us use your computer
to margaret so what flowers are you going with
margaret turns around annoyed but manages to keep her cool
im sorry but could i have a minute alone
show me around will you mrs
its been years
richard and mrs
whiting walk around the elementary school
do you think shell be long
ive got work to do
shell be out of there in two shakes
out of the corner of his eye richard catches gertrude teaching a class of second graders
he stops transfixed
re gertrude we are so lucky to have her
megher really left us shorthanded when he ran off in the middle of the school year
hes living out in the forest now with his wolves
richard hasnt heard anything that mrs
whiting has said
hes hypnotized by gertrude
she looks happy teaching these kids and they hang on her every word
whiting contd will you excuse me
the bell is about to ring i need to get ready for recess
not paying attention uh sure
richard goes to the door and gertrude sees him
good lord can that woman smile
she waves him in
the kids all turn to see richard when he opens the door
class this is my old friend richard
all together hi richard
richard and i used to be in this very same classroom together
we even had your old teacher mr
megher smelled like farty eggs
the class giggles
thats not a nice thing to say patrick
the bell rings
one girl gets up
gertrude eyeballs her
gertrude contd marcia
the child sits back down
gertrude waits a beat
ok everyone is excused for recess
all the kids pop up and head to the door
whiting directs traffic outside
richard makes his way to gertrude
he did smell like eggs
its still not a nice thing to say
and actually mr
megher smelled like wet dog and
makes smoking pot motion matanuska thunderfuck
but lets keep that between us
margaret reads over her e mail to frank
i give you my word as an editor and a friend
the door opens suddenly and margaret shouts
margaret contd five more minutes
margaret turns to find a pig tailed girl in the doorway
she shrieks and runs off
margaret wants to apologize but needs to keep working
margaret contd sorry
gertrude and richard wipe down the chalk boards together
they are very comfortable together and have an easy rapport
remember when mr
megher made us do this after school for a week
that was your fault
you tried to kiss me
a girl has to defend herself
tom cruise ala top gun i had the shot
i took it
gertrude rolls her eyes
shes heard this a hundred times
no top gun
you loved my top gun
you loved your top gun
i just smiled and laughed like a good girlfriend
i am dangerous
richard clicks his teeth together trying to mimic tom cruise
gertrude is not impressed
that cuts deep
ill have you know that
talk of margaret immediately shuts gertrude down
richard contd noticing her change in mood uh is something wrong
its been awhile but i can still tell when somethings wrong with you
gertrude doesnt want to say anything
richard contd what is it
you know i hate it when you get all quiet
i wish there was a better way to say this
better way to say what
i made a huge mistake
breaking up with you
are you apologizing for high school
oh thank god
i thought this was like something big
this is something big
i coulda used this about five years ago but im all good now promise
thank you for saying that though
gertrude sees that richard isnt getting her point
she pulls herself together
looking down i want you back
more to herself oh god hes making me say it again
looking at richard i want you back
we should be together
all the time
whoa whoa whoa
i know this isnt the best time to bring this up
my wedding day isnt the best time for you to bring up the idea of us dating
richards reaction stings and gertrude begins to well up
bringing this up is very hard for her
im not talking about dating
you should move back here
we can have the life you always talked about in high school
im ready for that now
why are you doing this
i know that the timing here sucks
but we are meant to be together
i know it
i think you know it too
no i dont
i dont know it
richard begins to pace
not sure what to say
every time he opens his mouth he cant find the words
then from the door an interruption
did margaret hear anything
her face gives nothing away
gertrude and richard act like nothing just happened but look guilty as hell
uh you all done
well see what he says
you ready to get back to the house
well lets go
see you at the wedding gertrude
gertrude just smiles
see you at the wedding
richard and margaret unload champagne
richard is still thinking about gertrude and wanting to be alone
so what did you and gertrude talk about
about her school
the kids and stuff
apparently my second grade teacher was a pot head
that was it
i was gone for awhile
cuts her off yeah
that was it
you know i can do this
you should really go try on the dress for my mom
i was going to go for a run first its been three days since i got out im feeling crazy
could care less whatever
margaret isnt accustomed to richard talking to her this way but doesnt push it
margaret runs at a fast pace deep in the woods
shes running hard muttering to herself and working out the aggression shes accumulated over the last thirty six hours
shes lost in her own world until she sees smoke and slows to a stop
margaret follows the smoke and hears a mysterious drumbeat
she soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water and a shaman dancing around it
he is dressed in a loin cloth and wears a carved bears head mask and tribal make up
his belly shakes as he spastically moves around the fire
the shaman sings a song that sounds centuries old
takuju magaluam ut uksu lingm ik pifiksailiriju m k tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam ut qangalan uarm
margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance
he begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs
exhausted he stops and catches his breath
he yells out again
shaman contd margaret welcome
she looks around
maybe another margaret is in the vicinity
shaman contd come to me margaret of new york
nope thats her
she carefully steps out into the clearing
shaman contd it is i father paxton
sure enough geoffrey is beneath all the make up
what ah are you doing
my shaman kevin told me to get out here and clear my head
as you know things have been a little crazy around here
you should join me
ya know ive got to get back
you closed minded southerners amuse me
never willing to leave the nest and try
im a big fan of the nest
geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher
dance with me
you besmirch my ways if you deny my circle
worried shes going to really piss him off margaret relents
i accept your circle
geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire
clear your mind and follow me
geoffrey begins dancing slowly contorting his body
margaret follows always a half step behind and cant get into it
after a few moments margaret stops
im gonna head back
were not done
i think i am
margaret begins to leave
geoffrey calls after her
margaret stops and turns around
geoffrey contd im sorry we got off on the wrong foot
but im making an effort here
dont leave now
much to her chagrin margaret stays
geoffrey is pleased
geoffrey contd thank you
switching gears yai
takuju magaluam ut uksu lingm ik pifiksailiriju m k
geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and speeds up the dance
margaret is getting better but it is still painfully awkward
geoffrey contd tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam ut qangalan uarm
geoffrey speeds up the dance
geoffrey contd now you
whatever comes out just chant
it is the way
youll feel better
close your eyes
margaret and geoffrey keep dancing
margaret closes her eyes but cant figure out what to say
geoffrey contd chant
i dont know any chants
looking at margaret its surprising she can make such a low noise
margaret contd ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
the drum beat continues
they continue to dance margaret is getting into it
margaret contd to the wall
margaret contd to sweat drop down my balls
geoffrey stops dancing
what did she say
margaret contd to all these bitches crawl
margarets eyes are closed she doesnt realize that shes broken out into a a lil john song
she continues to dance
margaret contd to all skee skee motherfucker
geoffrey takes the bear head mask off
margaret contd all skee skee got damn
from the trees the moment is broken when debbie shouts out
margaret stops chanting a lil john
oh debbie i didnt do anything
margaret sees debbie and grandma annie in the clearing
is she singing about balls
he told me i had to chant
oh you poor dear
geoffrey you cant do this
to margaret hes an eighth tlingit dear
he does this to keep in touch with his people
dont make fun of my heritage
and it was helping
dont you feel better
i feel better
come on sweetie we need to get you cleaned up
youve got a dress to try on
and geoffrey put that fire out and come in and help us with this wedding
geoffrey turns off the boom box that was hidden in the trees and the drum beat stops
with a fire extinguisher the bonfire comes to an end
debbie and annie wait outside a bathroom door in a massive master bedroom
they talk to margaret through the door
i am so excited
arent you excited
this was my dress from
my mother made it by hand
amazing how things come back into style
how does it fit
margaret speaks through the door
just buttoning up here
grandma and debbie enthusiastically make drum roll sounds
margaret opens the door and smiles
shes unsure of herself but looks fantastic
the dress fits great except
grandma annie contd your boobs are bigger than mine ever were
yeah its a little snug
come over here
debbie leads margaret to a mirror
grandma annie follows
its a lovely dress
debbie looks at margaret and spontaneously begins crying
through the tears youre so beautiful and such a great match for my richard
i know ive just met you but a mother can tell
when he looks at you i can tell hes in love
im so happy i get to share your day
weve got work to do
debbie collects herself then starts crying again
you go work downstairs ill finish this
debbie tries to calm down but cant
grandma annie contd go
debbie nods in agreement
smiling from ear to ear she leaves in tears
margaret and annie watch her go
grandma annie contd had to get rid of her before i gave you this
dont think she woulda recovered
grandma annie comes from behind and puts her arms around margarets neck
when she is done a stunning blue necklace lays on margarets neck
grandma annie contd you needed something blue
its silly but i didnt want to take any chances
the blue ones like this are very rare
my great grandfather gave it to my great grandmother when they were married
they were quite a scandal you know
he was russian and she was tlingit
grandma annie contd back then you had to get approval from every person in the tribe before you got married
it almost broke them up
howd they stay together
but im sure happy they did none of us would be here if they hadnt
grandma and margaret admire the necklace in the mirror
grandma annie contd i want you to have it
this is awful news for margaret
she might as well be stealing from annie
no no no
i dont want to hear it
grandmothers like to give their stuff away to their grandchildren
makes us feel like well always be a part of your life even after were gone
margaret puts her hand to the necklace and for the first time feels like a complete and total fraud
grandma annie contd are you feeling all right dear
margaret doesnt speak
annie patiently waits for her reply
margaret deliberates spilling her guts to annie but cant
margaret contd the dress is just a little tight
oh dont worry about that
weve got these seams by the arm thisll be easy
annie marks up the dress with tailors chalk
grandma annie contd we can fix this no problem
margaret smiles but knows that annie couldnt be more wrong
richard helps workers build a stage for the band
hes still in a foul mood when margaret interrupts in a panic
we need to talk
im a little busy
well im freaking out
i need to get away from here
go for another run
i did that
it did not help
im a little tired of you making demands and me just jumping
re wedding stuff were not going to need any of this if i dont get out of here
ok high maintenance
unlike the bulky yacht this boat is built for speed and maneuverability
richard starts her up
move over im driving
margaret cuts in front of richard and grabs the wheel
you dont know where were going
margaret opens up the throttle and they are off
it doesnt matter
margaret and richard leave everyone behind and take off for the horizon
as they jet up the coast away from civilization the green trees blue water and wildlife bears puffins moose that inhabit the coastline have a calming effect on both of
in alaska it doesnt take long to leave humanity behind
eventually the boat travels through a channel with steep mountain walls on either side
although it is still warm out an icy beach can be seen straight ahead
margaret contd where are we
the north pole
congratulations we made it
off margarets look its a glacier
you better let me take it from here
so like me youve navigated a lot of glacier fields
and not died
margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets richard steer
richard contd lady youve got issues
im a control freak
it doesnt stop there
this coming from the sociopath
id never bring me here
i mean to alaska
are you kidding me
richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine
doing this to them
i explained to you
they love you
do you get that
and youre still willing to lie to them
like you didnt know
didnt know what
that we were going to lie to them
i didnt know
well that makes you either stupid or ignorant
you think im stupid
no but whats behind door number two
what it was like
what what was like
to have a family
i forgot what it was like to have a family
ive been on my own since i was thirteen and id forgot what it was like to have people that love you and make you breakfast and give you necklaces
suddenly margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of breath
she goes to the side of the speed boat
margaret contd im going to take a walk
we need to head back
i need alone time
margaret looks at richard with a scared and confused look
im uh about to lose my shit
i need a second
stop right there
richard puts up his hands in surrender and stays put
margaret contd im going to be over there
away from you
just sit down turn around and act like youre not here
richard goes to speak but margaret motions for him to sit down and turn around
margaret gets off the boat and walks away from him on the glacier
margaret tries diaphragmatic breathing to calm down
margaret contd manic to herself you can do this
couple more hours and then youll never see these people again
eventually youll write a letter
send the necklace back
from the boat margaret
from the boat watch your step ok
it can be dangerous
again youre not supposed to be
margaret doesnt finish her sentence
richard sits with his back turned to margaret waiting for her reply
he doesnt hear anything
back still turned margaret
richard turns around and looks for margaret
he doesnt see her
he gets out of the boat and goes onto the glacier walking in the direction he last saw margaret
richard contd margaret
i know im breaking the rules here but where are you
he takes one more step before he hears
richard still cant see her but runs in the direction of her voice
he soon rounds a mound of ice and sees that margarets been swallowed by the ice
her upper torso sticks out of the glacier held up by her arms
her eyes are wide and shes almost hyperventilating
its a bizarre sight
margaret contd oh thank god
richard tries to control himself but bursts out laughing
margaret is really scared
margaret contd wh wh why are you laughing
ill get you out of there
youve broken through an ice bridge
it happens all the time
dont do that
dont do what
the thing that doctors do in e
when they tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to death that theyre going to be ok
dont do that
its not like that
we do need to be careful here though i dont want us both to fall in
stay still ok
richard is ten feet away from margaret now
hes checking the ice to see if it is stable
he slowly walks her way
so im going to walk up to you and very slowly pull you out
im really cold
yeah thats normal when youre surrounded by ice
makes sense richard stands over a stuck margaret whose head just comes up to his knee
he calmly looks down on her
so im going to pull you up by your armpits
im probably going to touch boob
but dont freak out
margaret shakes her head yes
richard reaches down and slowly lifts her out of the ice
margaret doesnt say a word
richard contd when i get you all the way out i need you to hold onto me
im going to carry you over there
margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around richard
hes strong so it isnt difficult for him to slowly carry her over the threshold style away from the hole in the ice
he speaks once theyre safe
richard contd ive uh never done that before
you said it was no biggie
margaret smiles back
richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms
she fits just right
margaret looks up to richard gratefully
margaret contd you shouldnt of laughed at me
you woulda laughed at me
while i was getting my camera
the two stare at each other for a beat
theres a real spark
they might kiss
gertrude wants me back
not what she was expecting
she looks down
it seemed like you were having
maybe we should do it
put me down
richard puts margaret down near the boat
she tries to regain her composure
margaret contd you wanna call it off
if you do
well tell them when we get back
margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her
richard drives the boat
they dont talk
richard and margaret walk towards the house which looms above them as they prepare to deliver the news that they arent getting married
the front door opens and geoffrey comes outside in a hurry
hes clearly been waiting
come with me
wheres mom dad
we all need to talk
richard and margaret look at each other not sure what to do
geoffrey storms off and they follow
richard margaret and geoffrey arrive at the door to the guesthouse
geoffrey stops before they go in
to richard i havent told your mother about any of this and i dont plan to
to margaret i was really beginning to like you
sorry about this
geoffrey opens the door and goes inside
the guesthouse has been converted into a squash court
in the middle of the court a man patiently sits on a metal folding chair
hey there kids
good to see ya
to dad what did you do
geoffrey doesnt answer
hes not proud of himself
richard contd getting angry what did you do dad
i called him yesterday
he told me that you were lying and that he was going to catch you
that he was going to send you to prison
to richard we made a deal and dad here flew me up
now you tell the truth and get off scott free
its like it never happened for you
you made a deal with him
on my behalf
you were making a mistake
thats none of your business
the hell it is
it is not fine
oh quack quack quack
just tell me what really happened and ill be on my way
no one gets hurt we all get what we want
margaret takes richards hand
to geoffrey you do not get to make this decision
this is my decision
to gilbertson the truth is
ive been working for margaret for three years
six months ago we started dating
i recently asked her to marry me and she said yes
see you both at
what are you doing richard
grabs margarets hand come on we gotta get ready
margaret and richard storm out of the squash court
the couple walks briskly to the house
what was i thinking
they act like theyre nice but really theyre evil
hes only doing it because he loves you
are you defending him
are you defending the king dick
think about this
oh ive thought about it
and know what i think
i think you saved my life
thank you margaret
getting married to you is the best thing thats ever happened to me
without this i mightve ended up back here
up at the house debbie opens the door
there you are
you two almost gave me a heart attack
cmon get dressed
to margaret time to sack up
richard winks and goes inside
margaret follows not sure
chairs are set up outside
guests arrive via boat
richard stands on the deck wearing his tuxedo
gertrude arrives for the wedding and they lock eyes
richard waves hello and mouths sorry
he goes back inside
geoffrey sits in his bedroom and watches tv
hes not dressed for the wedding yet
debbie shakes her head at him in the mirror as she puts on her ear rings
gilbertson eats every hors doeuvre thats offered to him
grandma knocks on the door and comes inside
we see margaret from head to toe
the dress veil and flowers look amazing
if i were one to brag id say that dress is perfect
matches the shoes
margaret pulls up the dress to reveal running sneakers
thosell be your best friend
wedding shoes stink
with the ocean in the background guests sit in white chairs
richard stands under a gazebo and smiles at his mother in the front row
he ignores geoffrey
gertrude sits nearby next to gilbertson
from the gazebo richard nods at a group of cello players who begin playing from downloaded sheet music that reads kool and the gang cherish
heads turn with the start of the music to see annie walk margaret down the aisle
when margaret recognizes the song she smiles
mouthing to richard nice song
richard shrugs his shoulders
is that your song dear
i guess so
margaret and annie stop at the end of the aisle
looking up margaret sees the justice of the peace ramone
yes the same guy from the liquor store and the strip club
its me ramone
margaret gives annie a kiss and then turns to richard
they whisper while they walk up to ramone
you look gorgeous
you look disgusting
so is this what you dreamed of when you were a little girl
oh you bet
they make it to the gazebo where ramone awaits
margaret contd ramone
to the crowd we are gathered here today to celebrate one of lifes greatest moments
to give recognition to the beauty honesty and unselfish ways
margaret looks at richard on the word unselfish but hes looking straight ahead determined to get through this
ramone contd of richard and margarets true love
true love gets margaret as well although no one in the audience notices
ramone contd before their family and friends
family and friends gets a reaction out of gertrude and geoffrey
she purses her lips
he holds on to his chair in order to keep himself seated
ramone contd for it is family and friends who taught richard and margaret to love so it is only right that family and friends all celebrate that love here today
ramone contd and if there is anyone who has cause why this couple should not be united in marriage and love they must speak now or forever hold their peace
gilbertson stays quiet
geoffrey takes a tug from a flask
ramone is about to continue but something gets his attention
hes not sure what to do
ramone contd mi amo do you have a question
we reveal that margaret has her hand halfway up eyes squinted shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself
then why is your hand up
i have something to say
its not a question though
can it wait a til after
what are you doing
margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd
they stare back unsure what to make of this foreigner
hey there folks
thanks for coming out
ive got a little announcement to make about the wedding
dont do this
margaret smiles and squeezes richards hand
not sure the best way to tell you all this
i made richard marry me
this is all a sham
gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air
margaret contd i was going to get kicked out of the country so i told richard that i would destroy his career if he didnt marry me
let me finish
to the paxton family richard wanted to stop this when we got off the plane but i wouldnt let him
dont blame him
this is all my fault
to ramone could you get the band started
and give these people something to drink
to gilbertson and you
meet me at your dingy in ten youre taking me to the airport
you got it
margaret nods hands richard the bouquet and confidently walks back up the aisle with all eyes on her
she stops when she gets to gertrude and leans down
take care of him
margaret walks back into the house
margarets wedding dress is laid out on the bed
her bag is packed
richard knocks and comes in
margaret is on the phone
unenthusiastically to phone uh huh
thats great frank
talk to you on monday
margaret hangs up
so franks back in
margaret nods distractedly
getting frank to do the publicity tour doesnt mean much right now
maybe thisll be your mockingbird
margaret starts collecting her bags
great exit back there
same old same old around here
wasnt sure if your mom would want me to strip the sheets so i just left them
ill let her know
why did you tell them all that
it was getting too messy
we werent going to be able to keep it up
dont start lying to me now
margaret stops for a moment
i heard you and gertrude at the school
i think she meant what she said
shes a great girl you should stay
its the right thing
youre perfect for each other
but what about you
what are you gonna do
margaret wants to keep the conversation short
dont worry about me
this is it
this is it
margaret walks to the door but stops
she turns to richard
despite her best effort to act cold she cant help herself
margaret contd have an amazing life ok
youre a good person
you deserve it
she puts out her hand and richard shakes it
its electric but margaret denies it
margaret contd goodbye richard
margaret walks down to the dock carrying her suitcase
she can hear that the party is in full swing and smiles
gilbertson drives his little speedboat and margaret holds her suitcase tight
its choppy and the outboard motor is loud
the two have to yell to talk
i want you to say the words
im not doing great in the dignity department can we not do this right now
margaret closes her eyes
hating that its come to this
ill publish your book
now was that so hard
richard sits by himself and finishes a beer by the shore
gertrude walks up to him looking fabulous with two more beers
so heres the deal
im going to have a million questions for you tomorrow
gertrude sits down next to richard
gertrude contd but for now i thought wed just sit here and drink beer
gertrude hands him a beer
richard thanks her with a kiss on the cheek
then realizing where and who he is with he puts his beer down
he turns to gertrude again with a determined look gives her a kiss on the lips then follows it up with an even bigger kiss
when they finish gertrude is grinning eyes closed
richard looks worried
something is wrong
you have been practicing
margaret told me that you uh turned into bit of a man whore down there
richard looks down
a bit ashamed
gertrude makes light
gertrude contd youre gonna have to put that in check if you move back
cause me and beth cable are the only two real options up here
and ill kick that bitchs ass
richard gives her a polite smile
hes not really in the mood to joke
gertrude contd so no jokes yet
im just a little
that kiss didnt seem confused
richard takes a beat to collect himself
youre amazing gert
and ive thought about being with you for a long time
a long time
when you said those things at the school
ive dreamed about hearing you say those things
richard contd but as crazy as this seems
i know now
that were just not meant to be
gertrude pulls back like shes been punched
richard contd thing is
when i said goodbye to margaret
i felt sick
for the three years we worked together i wanted to be as far away from her as possible
but now that shes gone
im just really
i want her with me
what is that
the question hangs in the air
i dont know
i think i have to find out
find out what
if she feels the same way
gertrude begins to tear up but wont let herself cry
whats a girl gonna do
voice cracking i guess you want who you want
gertrude gives a melancholy smile
im so sorry
but i gotta go
richard gets up
are you ok
gertrude nods her approval and richard runs off to the party
debbie geoffrey and annie sit at a table next to the bar dumbstruck looks on their faces
ramone mixes drinks and flips bottles
richard runs up to them all looking excited
what are you so god damn happy about
well im uh going to see margaret
she violated you
we should report her
who you gonna report her to mom
oh my god
hes got the stockholm syndrome
i dont have the stockholm syndrome
and she didnt violate me
what is going on richard
richard slows down and explains to his mom
im sorry i lied to you
that was an awful thing to do
but it took this weekend for me to see how funny and screwed up and perfect margaret is for me
i think shes
but you already thought she was the one
no i didnt
not until she left
does she think that too
i dont know
ive got to get to the airport to find out
debbie doesnt say anything then breaks into a smile
so romantic hes going to stop her from leaving
at the airport
but i gotta hurry
her plane leaves any second
i might not make it

cause i wont let you throw your life away for some woman
i dont care
i dont care
i love you and want you to understand
but im not asking your permission here

from behind them annie stands up and shouts
but suddenly a look of panic flashes across annies face
she grabs the table to steady herself but pulls the table cloth causing a loud crash
geoffrey and richard run over
mom are you ok
im having a
i need to go to the hospital
margaret and gilbertson board the jet together
margaret finds her seat in first class and discovers the handsome man from the flight before sitting nearby
re gilbertson is this another gay assistant
margaret doesnt say anything and takes her seat
two coast guardsman carry annie on a gurney to their waiting helicopter
geoffrey richard and debbie follow behind
they all pile into a large chopper and fly off
an oxygen mask covers annies face
geoffrey holds her hand
annie motions for geoffrey to come closer and he leans down
geoffrey sits up and shouts over the helicopter noise
she has something she wants to say to us
richard leans down and joins geoffrey and annie
their three heads are very close together
annie speaks to them both through the oxygen mask
listen to me
you two need to stop fighting
youll never see eye to eye but youre family
if this doesnt stop one day youll regret it
to geoffrey promise me youll stand by richard even if you dont agree with him
promise youll work harder to be a part of this family
i promise grandma
annie closes her eyes
she looks peaceful
a moment passes
then suddenly annie takes off her mask sits up and yells to th pilot
annie contd as if nothing happened im feeling much better
i dont need to go to the hospital
take us to the airport please
richard and geoffrey are confused
what is going on
so the coast guard cant hear did you fake a heart attack
we didnt have time for your squabbling and i knew a helicopter would be the quickest way to the airport
it seemed like the best way
the best way
and remember you two promised me that youre going get along
i wasnt kidding about that
maam im not authorized to take you to the airport
to pilot larry ferris
dont make me call your mother
gilbertson talks non stop
margaret is in hell
i want my book launch to be special
im thinking we throw a soiree at the nevsky monastery
margaret stares at him blankly
gilbertson contd as if she should know where dostoyevsky is buried
i thought you were a professional
margaret closes her eyes to numb the pain
the helicopter lands and richard jumps out
his family follows as they run to the control tower
chuck has an easy job
jets fly into sitka but there are only about six flights a day
he is half awake as he radios margarets flight
reggae music plays in the background
flight youre clear for takeoff
roger that chuck
the phone rings in the tower
chuck picks up
intercut as necessary with richard running on a cell phone
talk to me
hey chuck its richard

how often does this happen to you
need you to do me a solid brother
i gotta see my girl and shes on that flight
could you stop it for me
no can do brohan

lose my jobby job if i delivered that favor
oh cmon chuck
the plane rattles as it gains speed for takeoff
margaret studies the safety pamphlet trying to ignore gilbertson
so next topic
lets invite the bill clintons and leave out the paris hiltons ok
gilbertson smiles as he looks out the window and sees the plane leave sitka
richard and his family stand outside the tower and watch margarets plane take off
once she gets back to new york itll be like this never happened
richard looks defeated
geoffrey sees how sad his son is and takes a deep breath
so you know i think you shouldnt be with margaret right
youve made that crystal clear
looks at annie well consider this me keeping my promise
geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button
he waits for an answer
geoffrey contd to phone hey
yeah yeah yeah her running out was something
but thats what im calling about
ive got a favor to ask you a bout one of your planes
gilbertson continues to talk
margaret is in a stupor
you know those two hundred pages i took out
im going to put them back
a flight attendant comes to margaret and interrupts
would you come with me
margaret is excited to get away from gilbertson
yes of course
she unbuckles her seat belt about to get out of her seat
whats this about
never done this before theres someone on the radio for you
the flight attendant points to the flight attendant cb located at the front of the plane outside the cockpit
flight attendant contd uh a richard paxton
margaret shakes her head and re buckles her seat belt
tell him im not here
richard and his family are huddled around the radio in the tower
chuck sits nearby
from radio im sorry
she wont come talk to you
shes never going to pick up
to richard know what home slice
cut this chica loose
you remember beth cable
shed totally be into you
suddenly richard has an idea
he picks up the hand mic
excuse me miss flight attendant could you ask the captain to do me one more favor
the captain comes on over the loudspeaker
over plane loudspeaker welcome to flight to seattle this is your captain
weve reached our cruising altitude of feet
flight timell be three hours and thirty minutes
richard has something hed like to say to you
over loudspeaker uh hey margaret
and cause im on the loudspeaker hey everyone on the plane
the other passengers look around to try and figure out whos margaret
meanwhile margaret looks down and acts like she doesnt know either
contd over loudspeaker this certainly isnt how i wanted to do this
i mean im not really into the whole baring your soul in front of strangers thing but i figure its now or never
so here goes
richard puts down the hand mic for a second to gain composure
his family encourages him on
youre doing great man
richard pushes the button down on the hand mike
i know youre used to being on your own
and that youre comfortable with your life the way it is
and that in a million years you wouldnt have thought that we should be together
i know because i felt the exact same way
every passenger is enraptured by the words coming out of the loudspeaker
the flight attendants the handsome man everyone
over loudspeaker and you know what else i know
i know that im tired of being alone
and i think youre tired of being alone too
so come on
talk to me
the handsome man turns to margaret
with genuine concern do you really feel like youre alone
oh good lord
richard and his family stare at the radio waiting to see if there is going to be an answer
chuck crosses his fingers
from radio what the hell are you doing
everyone in the tower smiles
theyre making progress
we need to talk
intercut as necessary
margaret stands at the front of the plane with the passengers watching
have you ever thought there might be a reason weve been together for the last three years
as boss and assistant
things change margaret
yeah things change
is that the best you got
geoffrey hits richard as if to say see thats what i said
richard composes himself
now tell me the truth
when you left were you relieved or sad that we didnt have an excuse to be together anymore
geoffrey gives richard the thumbs up
that was a good one
whats your point
because i am sick that you left
and if you feel sick too then why shouldnt we just be together
margaret goes to answer but stops
richard is right
she wants to go back
even the passengers on the plane can see it
are you thinking about going back to him
margaret doesnt answer
gilbertson contd we have a deal
you cant back out now
the flight attendant steps in annoyed that gilbertson is trying to break up richard and margaret
sir you need to sit down
i will do no such thing
sir im ordering you to return to your seat
other passengers yell sit down asshole at gilbertson
who said that
sir this is your third and final warning
he pokes the flight attendant im a federal officer so why dont you get me another cocktail and mind your own
volts of electricity surge through gilbertson
he twitches violently and crashes to the floor
behind him the handsome man holds a stun gun and a badge
well im a federal air marshall
and youre under arrest for disobeying a crew member assault and possible intoxication
the handsome man pulls out flex cuffs zips them around gilbertsons wrists and throws him in the bathroom
he then takes the cb from margaret and speaks to the passengers
handsome man contd sorry everybody but protocol says we need to get this unruly passenger off the plane asap
sitkas the closest airport so if its ok with you im gonna have the captain turn this bird around
there are wild cheers from the passengers
handsome man contd winks at margaret told you i was a romantic
flight glides to a safe landing
richard and his family wait on the tarmac and the plane taxis to them
a truck drives stairs to the front door of the plane and the door opens
margaret steps out
richard walks up the steps
this wasnt supposed to happen
richard looks margaret in the eye
but it did
margaret looks down
a little embarrassed
im not the kind of girl who gets saved
richard smiles and without warning margaret grabs him and plants a long deep and wet kiss on him
the long kiss is interrupted by the handsome man and gilbertson
uh sorry but excuse us
the handsome man leads a handcuffed and still dazed gilbertson down the steps
to gilbertson hey
do you think getting arrested might affect you at work
gilbertson has no retort
margaret contd oh and im not going to be able to publish your book after all
so you are getting married this weekend
but who knows
looking at richard we might by the time you get out of jail
gilbertson makes a go to hell face and shuffles off
margaret turns back to richard
margaret contd ive got some explaining to do
margaret and richard walk down the steps and stand in front of richards family
margaret contd to debbie hi
ive known your son for years but weve just recently begun to see each other romantically
to geoffrey i want to get to know you all and spend some real time up here in alaska
to annie im not sure when you are going to see him get married but i promise as long as im with him hell be happy
passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen
thats all we ever wanted
grandma annie gives margaret and richard a big hug
debbie joins in
the party is in full swing
balzac chases his balls
ramone slides onstage and sings with the band
he has a beautiful voice
debbie and geoffrey cut a rug
theyve done this before
gertrude and annie chat and laugh at a nearby table
the handsome man brings gertrude a drink
grandma annie winks and leaves these two alone
margaret and richard dance
all smiles even though they arent very good
and as everyone dances we track up the tallest tree on the island to an eagles nest at the very top
inside the nest three eaglets chirp along to the music snuggled up to margarets phone
