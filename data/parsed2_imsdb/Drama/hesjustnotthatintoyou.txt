written by abby kohn marc silverstein july we float down through a serene leafy park to the childrens play area
there in the sandbox a beautiful five year old girl plays among a group of kids
i have a theory about how this all started
a six year old boy approaches
he watches the little girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle
and then out of nowhere the little boy pushes the why did you do that
because you smell like dog poo
some of the other kids snicker at this brilliant one liner
our little girls face turns red
youre so stupid just like dog poo
youre made of poo
and then just to punctuate he jumps on the sandcastle smashing it
finally our little girl starts to cry
our beautiful girl sits at a kitchen table with her mom
she can only get out one syllable between big wet sobs
honey do you know why that little boy did those things
and said those things
the little girl shakes her head no
because he likes you
uh excuse me but what the hell
where did that rumor start
because moms have been spreading it for years
that little boy is doing those terrible things because he has a crush on you
we see our little girl take this in like she is just now beginning to understand the ways of the world
do you understand what this means
we are all encouraged to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk that means he likes you
sure thats a lesson that might serve us as five year olds but many of us keep believing this advice well into adulthood
a cute college girl sits crying in front of her answering machine as her roommate looks on
then as we get older we carry on this tradition of misreading the signals men send by encouraging our friends to do the same
the machine evilly flashes in the new messages window
that phi delt so obviously liked you
im sure he just lost your number
a hot executive woman stands in the office hallway watching a sexy male colleague walk by
he does not give her a second glance
her female secretary looks on
hes not asking you out because hes intimidated by your professional success and emotional maturity
a bunch of twenty somethings sipping cocktails
one of them is crying smeared mascara puffy eyes etc
heres the problem
he likes you too much
youre too pretty and awesome
he cant handle it
its because hes just getting out of a serious relationship
two middle aged women work out on ellipticals
its because hes never had a serious relationship
two hipster japanese girls making their way through a crowded tokyo department store
shigerus inability to commit clearly stems from his failure to properly imprint on his mother during breast feeding
a pretty young woman weaves banana leaves with a friend
im sure he forgot your hut number
or didnt get enough approval from his father
or was eaten by a giraffe
this last part seems to cheer up the pretty woman
why do we say this stuff to each other
why do we tell each other these lies
is it possible that its because were too scared and its too hard to say the one obvious truth thats staring everyone in the face
gigi pretty and approachable sits in a booth at a hip mt
vernon date spot with conor cute but holding onto his frat boy roots
they sip their near empty cocktails
so janine told me youre a real estate agent
but dont worry not one of the cheesy ones who puts his headshot on bus benches and grocery carts
so just like on frisbees and notepads
gigi smiles shes doing well
you got it
my thoughts exactly
gigi sips her drink and looks at conor
i wonder why janine never thought of introducing us before
yeah i dont know i ummm their waitress appears cutting him off
you guys ready for another round
conor looks to gigi
you want one more
only if you do
but i mean if you have to get going i totally
gigi trails off
conor considers this for a long moment
we can see on gigis face that she knows that the outcome of this date hangs in the balance
its an eternity
gigi breathes a sigh of relief
you had ketel and soda right
gigi nods and smiles clearly flattered that conor remembered her order
she scoots a little closer to him
gigi and conor hug outside the restaurant
well conor i had a really nice time
it was really nice meeting you
gigi waves flirtatiously and walks away smiling
she turns around to look and sees conor take his cell gigi takes her cell out of her purse and dials
hey its me
i think it went well
she sneaks another look over her shoulder to see conor
and i think he might me leaving me a message at home as we speak
we freeze frame on gigi mid step
then the image conor also in freeze frame
the image unfreezes and we continue with conor as he dials his cell phone
hey its me
i just wanted you to know that i was thinking about you
anna hot in an earthy sort of way heads down the aisle
she holds her cell phone in one hand a bottled water and a bag of soy nuts in the other
conor thats so nice
as anna gets to the checkout theres one person ahead of her
he looks back to see her hes ben good looking and supremely likeable
they share a smile
do you want to go ahead
youve only got two things
into phone hold on
she looks at what hes got a six pack of sierra nevada
youve only got one thing
well technically its six
and im still mulling over a gum purchase
he steps aside to let her go
into phone hey let me call you right back
she hangs up the phone and moves past ben hands her things to the emotionless cashier
as he rings them up she looks back at ben they share another look
she hands the cashier her atm card he swipes it
oh my word
i just deposited money today
theres no way its not that
let me check something
he turns and rifles through a stack of papers finally finding what he was looking for
our sizzlin summer promotion
youre our th customer in june
the cashier reaches under the register and pulls out an igloo cooler and hands it to anna
are you kidding
do i have that kind of manner
a joking manner
anna looks to ben
she looks like shes about to burst
i swear to god this is the most exciting thing thats ever happened to me
ben cant tell if shes kidding
is that sad
no its charming
anna smiles wide admiring her cooler
then wait no
i cant accept this
you were here first
i didnt win at all
yes you did
trust me its fate
you were meant to have that cooler
anna throws her arms around him and hugs him
thank you so much
ben cant help but laugh
conor enters his apartment
alex sits on the couch watching tv
how was the date
conor heads for the kitchen and turns back
why are you here
my cables out
conor returns from the kitchen with a beer
you didnt hear the phone ring did you
anna gave me the ill call you right back
how long ago
do i call back
ill call back and say that im going to bed
it is genius
because then i can say in case you were going to call me back dont cause ill be sleeping
conor pulls off his jacket and tosses it next to a box which contains about frisbees
on each frisbee conor dials his cell phone as he heads back to his room
we tilt up to find anna and ben
anna looks at her phone presses ignore and stashes it in her purse
what was i saying
i think you were telling me how you dont want to be like your mom and wake up and realize you didnt pursue your dreams
ben opens his gum and offers anna a piece
she takes one and laughs a bit embarrassed
little intense for grocery store chatter
i might even be able to help you out
theres a guy at my firm who has exclusively music clients
that would be amazing
what are you like my savior
anna digs through her purse to find a piece of paper
she writes down her number and holds it out to him
he looks at it contemplating
he doesnt take it
i dont do this
dont do what
help struggling singers
help hot pilates instructing singers who happen to be very charming
anna takes the slip of paper and puts it away
do you want to give me your card
i bet youre allowed to do that
ben considers this
i guess that would be ok
we see anna and ben talking
they shake hands awkwardly and ben heads towards us
ben gets in the car bag in hand and joins neil arty and kind looking whos behind the wheel
so who was that
a prospective client
i can talk to a woman neil
it doesnt have to be like that
neil looks at him smirk growing
neil starts the car and they pull away
neil walks into a vast space
nice art a cozy yet architectural look a cool place to live
we pan over to a couch where beth is wrapped in a throw blanket watching tv
shes got her hair in a messy bun
he joins her on the couch
and sees that the tv is off
just got off the phone
neil gets up again
you want some tea or something
it was my baby sister
shes getting married
ive always liked that devon guy
thats really great
beth looks at him
she doesnt look that happy
do you think its great
so you think its great that theyre getting married but you never feel like were going against nature or something by not getting married
he sits back down puts his arms around her
going against nature is like that cat who started nursing that monkey
were just two people who arent married
beth manages a weak smile
i actually think the odds of having a successful relationship increase by not getting married
look at my parents all marriage got them was thirty two years of misery and joint checking
yeah i know
i get that
like ive always told you i love you and we dont need a marriage certificate to legitimize our relationship
lemme get you some tea
beth starts to cry but quickly dries her tears and forces herself to pull it together
a brick row house in an up and coming neighborhood clearly under massive renovation
we make our way through rooms with plastic covering the doorways until we find janine stepping into the hallway
she checks herself in a vintage mirror straightens it a tad then heads down the stairs to find gigi on her cell phone
gigi slams it closed
ok so clearly he hasnt called
gigi shakes her head
maybe hes away on business
he sells real estate
staying in town is his business
janine ponders this
look let me tell you after the first time i went out with ben he didnt call me for eleven days
and now hes like the worlds best husband
that happens all the time
gigi manages a small smile
this is all your fault
you set me up with him
no you asked if i knew any guys and i gave conor your number
thats not a set up
when i do a set up i weigh pros and cons
i do my due diligence
all i know about conor is he sold us this house
gigi peers out the window
he sold you a house in the ghetto
its a neighborhood in transition
gigi makes a move for the phone janine stops her
he said he always hangs at red maple after work
maybe i should do a little drive by
off gigi panic seeping in
amber pretty if a little thick in the middle sits in the courtyard of an office park in her work clothes
caller id was the worst thing thats ever happened to me
total invasion of my personal freedom
when a guy doesnt call me it is my right my duty even to call him and hang up several thousand times
or at least until his mother shouts at me in albanian and blows a police whistle into the phone
i mean calling and hanging up is an age old expression of love and frustration and too many wine coolers and who is at fing t to take that away
next thing you know someone is going to ban me from sitting in my car in front of a guys house blaring where is your heart by kelly clarkson until
his new stupid girlfriend comes outside and threatens to scratch my eyes out with her acrylics
i mean a girl deserves freedom of expression right
we pan down the row of mats students obediently doing the mermaid
we finally land on gigis mat gigi manages to twist herself into a passable mermaid as her cell phone lies in full view on her mat
shower is on curtain pulled
a cell phone rings
an arm shoots out of the shower and grabs it from the sink
mom i gotta call you back
gigi lays in bed her cell phone right next to her head
one eye pops open checks the phone and closes again
a typical corporate style office
walled off cubicles for the junior execs outer offices for management
gigi is in her cubicle
janine her friend and we now learn co worker sits on gigis desk
so this was at the end of the date or at the beginning
why does it matter
nice meeting you at the beginning of the date is normal
nice meeting you at the end could be a blow off
maybe it was at the beginning
then thats fine
hes gonna call
or maybe it was at the end
or maybe it was nice to meet me
wait was it nice meeting you or nice to meet you
i cant remember
nice to meet you is ok
nice meeting you is like do you want your receipt in the bag
the girls look up to find beth standing there listening
remember the days when you guys at least pretended to be working when i came in
beth heads to her office
janine and gigi follow
janine hows the press release
janine clearly organized flips open her notebook beckon the baking to begin
mccormick the flavor expert introduces five fun filled flavors that will definitely delight dessert divas
gigi stifles a laugh
maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration but otherwise good
to gigi where are we with the company newsletter
i am so almost done with that
its just been a little hard to focus on my article about the two sets of twins in market research when the guy who may or may not be the
guy of my dreams refuses to call me
beth looks at gigi more sympathetic friend than boss
look after my first date with neil i called him
there are no rules anymore
why should you have to wait for him to get off his ass
gigi sits at her desk janine standing by her side
shes got a few sheets of paper on her desk
gigi takes a deep breath picks up the office phone and dials
janine gives her a thumbs up
listening to receiver yes
gigi nods its all under control
reading off her paper hey conor
i just thought i hadnt heard from you and i mean how stupid is it that a gal has got to wait for a guys call anyway right
gigi laughs but as she looks back to the notes she seems confused
she turns to janine panicked mouthing what does this say
janine looks shes no help
clearly ad libbing i mean were all equal right
more than equal more women are accepted into law school now than men and we do better in those police simulations where you can mistakenly shoot innocent people rifles through
the pages i mean i dont know if you saw that dateline but women practically have penises now right
looks to janine helpless well call me
this is gigi
gigi hangs up unsure
she looks to janine
hes totally gonna call
gigi stares at the phone
then she feigns disinterest in the phone
it still doesnt ring
finally she picks up the receiver to listen for a dial tone
how can there be no dial tone
she frantically jiggles the cord then hears something
is that you
i cant talk now
ill call you back
she hangs up stares at the phone again
a look of determination crosses her face
conor never called so im on the precipice of staging a casual run in at red maple
pick up if you want to stop me
beat then really fast tacit compliance bye
gigi hurriedly hangs up and heads out the door
a crowded sceney restaurant bar with a giant red japanese maple growing behind the bar thus the name
we follow a thin black clad hostess as we wind through the throng of stylish twentysomethings at the bar to a busy kitchen
off the kitchen a door leads to alex sits at a small cluttered desk rifling through some papers
then from the doorway knock knock
alex looks up to see kelli ann red maples hot hostess standing in the doorway
she makes her way in
here we are
same shift again
i make the schedule
i figured it was no coincidence
she leans against the desk
alex keeps working
i had fun the other night
its amazing where shots of patron will get you
kelli ann laughs then thinks wait was that nice
anyway i was thinking maybe tonight after work
we could you know
alex stops what hes doing looks up at her
look kelli ann what happened between us the other night was fun
but were way understaffed tonight i even have to man the bar and thats why i scheduled you
he goes back to work
kelli ann stands there frozen
alex can feel her eyes on him
are we good here
kelli anns face goes flush
she tries to hide it
she backs up puts on a smile
alex exhales goes back to work
in the back doorway leading to the alley alex stands chatting with tyrone a busboy who smokes a cigarette he holds just outside the doorway
kelli ann approaches trying to squeeze through and he has to take a step to catch his balance
he turns around to see what happened but kelli ann keeps walking eyes front
he and tyrone share a look
tyrone laughs as alex shakes his head not happy
gigi enters slowly looking around searching for conor
she tries to move toward the bar as shes met by kelli ann who grabs a few menus and slaps on a smile
are you joining us for dinner or im meeting someone
gigi continues to scan the place not paying attention
im meeting someone
i believe you mentioned that
gigi finishes her visual tour of the room no conor
im gonna wait at the bar
thats a great idea
gigi walks off
kelli ann takes her place behind the hostess stand
gigi grabs a stool with a good view of the door
alex now behind the bar approaches
what can i get you
oh thats ok
im meeting someone
alex takes her in
shes clearly nervous
got a hot date
i dont know if youd call it hot i mean this guy conor and i have only been out the one time so wait conor barry
gigi is busted
oh uhh yeah conors not coming in tonight
did he forget he was supposed to meet you
see when i said meeting someone i guess that was kind of a broad term kind of a wide interpretation of the word meeting because i could just call him
alex reaches for the phone
i mean totally unnecessary
i mean i actually was just in the area so i figured id just swing by and see if he was around because uhhh alex waits looking at gigi amused
she is panicking
i uhh had to return his gigi frantically searches her coat pockets searching for something anything and finally fishes out a pen
she looks at it and decides to go with it
i had to return this pen
he left this
so i thought i should really return it before he you know conspiratorially to alex freaks out
alex looks at her skeptically
and then takes the pen and inspects it
frankel adult child and geriatric dentistry
look im not gonna judge about what may or may not be important to someone
thats not even his dentist
then whos his dentist
gigi looks at alex for a long moment and finally folds
conor and i went out last week
and i just
i thought if i ran into him
i dont know
im gonna go
gigi struggles to get out quickly
alex looks at her holding her pen looking quite frazzled and softens
just hang out for a second
lemme buy you a drink
gigi smiles and sits back down
the bar is nearly empty
alex is totaling receipts and gigi is still nursing a drink
look you seem like a cool girl so im just gonna be honest conor is never going to call you
how do you know
because im a guy
its how we do it
he said it was nice meeting me
i dont care if he said you were his favorite female since his mommy and joanie cunningham
over a week went by and he didnt call
but maybe he called me and i didnt get the message
or maybe he lost my number or was out of town or was hit by a cab or his grandma died
or maybe he just didnt call because he has no interest in seeing you again
yeah but my friend terri once went out with this guy who never called and she totally wrote him off then like a year later she ran into him your
friend terris an idiot
and shes the exception
but what if im the exception
youre the rule
and the rule is if a guy doesnt call you he doesnt want to call you
i know what blowing off a woman looks like
i do it early and i do it often
trust me if a guy is treating you like he doesnt give a shit he doesnt
gigi thinks this over
why are you telling me all of this
arent these man secrets like why men need to watch televised golf
i dont know
you looked like you could really use the help
youve given me a lot to think about
gigi smiles at him
gigi comes in carrying a messy handful of papers with crazy hair and wearing the last outfit we saw her in
i was up all night
please say you were working on the newsletter
its basically done
but this is important
whats happening with your hair
beth comes out of her office and looks at gigi
please come in my office before the others see that you have mini muffin stuck in your hair
gigi paces in front of beths desk
i think i figured it out
remember when i went out with that notary public
and he cheated on me
and then anastasia from upstairs told us that story about how her boyfriend cheated on her at the beginning but then he totally changed and theyre married and crazy in
i thought that guy was a process server
anyway the point is anastasia is the exception
not the rule
we have to stop listening to these stories because the rule is that most guys who cheat on you up front dont really care about you very much
gigi consults her crumpled pieces of paper
exhibit a chad the drummer who lived in his storage space
he only used me for rides yet i continued to stalk him for most of
then there was don who broke up with me every friday so he could have his weekends free
i was so delusional about our relationship that i referred to him as my husband to random people like my dental hygenist
and all my friends would tell me stories about how things might work out with these dipshits because they knew someone who knew someone who dated a dipshit just like
mine and that girl ended up getting married and living happily ever after
but thats the exception
and were not the exception were the rule
gigi sits down spent
but beth has been listening
so let me see if i understand
what youre saying is that when people tell me about some girl they know who dated a guy for thirteen years and then he finally married her thats the exception
and the rule is that guys like neil who are with girls like me for seven years without getting married are never getting married
beth is serious
gigi freezes tries to backtrack
no no no
thats not what im saying
this has absolutely nothing to do with you
i was just talking you know about me
off beth knowing its about her too
anna and mary beautiful but doesnt know it sit in side by side pedicure chairs
anna holds a business card
it is impossible not to like this guy
im pretty sure he was heavily flirting with me outside eddies and then he tells me hes married
youd think id be pissed but i literally could not stop myself from liking him
but hes married
i realize that
i keep trying to force myself to picture him in some church saying vows to some woman and even that doesnt cool it off
what is my problem
there was this guy who worked in my dads printing business
married for fifteen years to a nice lady
and then he meets this woman at some church event
and he told my dad he just had never felt anything like it before
i mean he had finally met the love of his life
so he divorced his wife and hes been with this other woman for years and they are blissfully happy
i mean what if you meet the love of your life but you already married someone else
are you supposed to pass them by
im calling him
anna pulls her feet out of the pedicure bath goes in a private corner and dials her cell phone
this is anna marks
well i was just taking you up on your offer
you said you might know someone who could help me out and i thought we could discuss it over coffee
anna waits for a response
on the other end she hears some rustling some silence definitely awkwardness
look i just
i cant anna
you seem great
its just i dont know
i should go
anna takes this in stunned
she hangs up
her eyes sting
she cant face mary so she just stares at weird bleached out photos of nails and holds back the tears
finally she looks at her cell phone and dials again
conor opens the door to find anna standing there
i am so psyched that you called
i had sort of given up on you when you didnt call me back the other night
well you know
i was just thinking about you
conor buys it and ushers her inside
anna is stretched out with a wine glass in hand feet in conors lap
he rubs her feet as they talk
give me the categories again
there are four
sexy smart funny or cute
and each person can only be two
like sarah jessica parker is funny and sexy
or bill clinton is sexy and smart
i love that you are hot for clinton
so which am i
what was i again
smart and cute
conor smiles happy for any compliment
she bangs him on the head with a pillow
cute and sexy are in the looks column
no one wants to be in all one column
well i sound like a jackass if i say youre all four
but youre so obviously all four
youre the best
anna sits up and moves to conor
she looks at him pulls him in for a nice long hug
i better go
i mean you could just stay here tonight
anna gives him a knowing look
its been a while
its just im fried
is that alright
anna smiles and gets up
conor reluctantly follows her to the door
she kisses him on the lips smiles and leaves
beth opens the door to find neil standing on the couch in his socks hanging a painting
hey babe is this straight
why are you hanging that
i told you id do it weeks ago
you dont like it there
i love it there
but just stop
its the image isnt it
i didnt see it before but youre right it totally looks like a sagging boob
beth is silent
you want me to take it down
i want you stop doing anything nice
is this a trick
i need you to stop being nice to me unless youre gonna marry me after
is that funny
it was just i was just see you cant keep being nice to me and i cant keep pretending like this is something that its not
weve been together over seven years
you know me
you either want to marry me or you dont
or there is the possibility that i just dont really believe in the concept of bullshit
bullshit for every woman whos been told by some guy that he doesnt believe in marriage just to see him turn around eight months later and marry some twenty four
year old girl he met at the gym
beth tries to hold back her tears
neil looks stunned
he hops down off the couch and goes to her
honey where is all this coming from
from the place that i have been hiding from you for the last five years because i didnt want to seem demanding or clingy or psycho or whatever
so i never ask
but now im going to neil looks at her
she looks at him
are you ever going to marry me
beth looks at neil
there is a long painful silence
i cant do this anymore
she walks out of the room
amy sits with a sleeping baby in her arms
i was with damon for six years
he asked me to marry him on the phone because hes just so different and cool like that
said hed eventually get me a ring which he didnt but he did buy himself a ring because isnt that so hilarious and cool that the guy is wearing the
then my favorite part is i stayed with him even after he took back his proposal and introduced the idea of a relation vacation
isnt that a cute name
let me explain the concept it involves dating a girl from the time shes thirty two to the time shes thirty nine possibly robbing her of the ability to bear
children and then after all that wanting to take a year off
and giving it a fun name that you can put on t shirts
looks at the baby smiles i left him
ben our married guy from the grocery store sits on the floor in a barely furnished room and dials his cell
this is ben
look i know its been a little while since you called
i just it took me by surprise
but i offered to help you with your career and i dont see why i cant do that right
so give me a call
maybe you can come by the office this week or something
okay take care
ben hangs up
and stares into space until the door opens to reveal janine
gigis co worker
and bens wife
hey how ben is clearly startled
shit you scared me
janine looks at him
is everything ok
she sits down next to him looks at him intently
are you smoking again
well you get jumpy when you smoke
ben puts his arm around janine and pulls her close
im not smoking
so why dont we worry about what color were gonna paint this room instead of worrying about things that arent happening
janine contentedly curls up to ben
i dont know i was thinking maybe pink
well i mean at some point
janine gives ben a knowing look
he gets it
you sure were ready for this now
but i mean we could paint one room pink and one blue just in case
ben looks at her and laughs
youve already created the perfect family in this house and we dont even have drywall
i know i promised wed wait to talk about it ben looks at her snuggled against him
i think were almost ready to start talking about it
janine smiles contentedly
ive always liked the name gisele
she lets him
packed federal hill happy hour bar scene
gigi and janine stand squeezed in among the after work crowd
jarrad early thirties chats amiably with gigi
well ladies i guess i have to get back to the office

i met you
janine and gigi melt
so id love to call you sometime

and heres my info
jarrad hands gigi his card as well

he starts to head over to his buddies
gigi is confused

are you hearing from me or am i getting a call
jarrad turns back
you said youd love to call me but then you said look forward to hearing from you
see how thats kinda confusing
look well talk
well get in touch
he tries to take off again
ooopsie you did it again
you know what
why dont we just say that youll call me and then we can skip all the nonsense
jarrad just gives her a blank stare
or i guess i could just call you goodbye gigi
he takes off
the girls watch him
he was cute
please dont cyber stalk him
gigi looks at the name on the card jarrad montrose and then tears his business card in two
wait what are you doing
im not calling him
if he wants to see me hell call
wow that guy alex really made an impression on you
was he hot
he was just right
off gigi sipping her drink full of optimism
the offices of baltimores gay weekly paper
the elevator opens and in walks mary cheerful as always
we follow her down the hall as she ad libs hellos to her co workers
one thing becomes glaringly clear she is she gets to her desk and is descended upon by bruce nathan and joshua
all mid s
mary looks at them smiling enjoying their impatience
he asked me out
oh my god
well he emailed
did he travel by carriage and leave his calling card with your lady in waiting
he myspaced me
the guys all look skeptical
i dont know
my slutty sister says myspace is the new booty call
well what am i supposed to do
things have changed
people dont just meet organically anymore
if i want to make myself more attractive to the opposite sex i dont go get a new haircut i update my profile
thats just how it is
the guys look at her starting to understand
marys back to work
she smiles at the guys they disperse as she picks up
ad sales this is mary
conor sits on a bench newspaper folded open on his lap
hey its conor
annas uh friend
so did you see it
im not sure about this
you gotta trust me
its a burgeoning market
youre gonna make a fortune
conor looks at the paper
i hope so
but like did you have to put me on the page with the massage ads
it was either that or on the page with the personals
i made a call
hey have you talked to anna lately
conor leaves the paper and gets up
he walks away still on the phone we stay with the newspaper and we push in
under various inch ads for masseuses s m and leather under which is a picture of conor standing in front of a brick tudor a sold sign proudly displayed
in the background two men look lovingly at their new home
paige blonde and angelic looks on as laura catherine and beth pull on matching coral dresses
i do not understand how you got mom to sew all of these in two weeks
she wanted to do it
mom told me she felt like an old indonesian lady in a sweatshop
no she didnt
why again do you need to get married so fast
youre so pregnant
im not pregnant

i want to see you chug a beer
were in love you assholes
thats what people do when theyre in love they get married
and looks at beth
bethie you know i didnt mean its ok

you should have told us
you have to come over and have dinner with me and steven and the kids tonight ok
you can even stay over if you want
why would she want to hang out with us and our husbands
seriously beth isnt that exactly what you want to avoid right now
but before beth can even answer
you know what if being in the wedding is too painful you guys its cool
so i lost a little time
beth grabs her purse and starts for the door
so not a big deal
youre still really young
everything you learned in that relationship is just gonna make the next one so much stronger
beth exits still wearing a half sewn bridesmaids dress
she wasted so much time
i knew he was never gonna propose
the girls nod in agreement
ben sits behind his desk sifting through a pile of papers
we pan around to anna sitting across from him
i know its here somewhere
i spoke to george lane in music and he gave me this whole list of references for you
you can call me when you find it
i swear i didnt lure you here under false pretenses
but a girl can dream
he looks up at her and smiles
youre obviously too good of a guy
they share a long look
why are you married again
itll be good for me
tell me how you decided that you could not be without this other woman
wed been together since college
she gave me an ultimatum we get married or we break up
so we got married
you just caved
youre a dick if you date a girl for too long and dont marry her
but you marry her and then youre an asshole for marrying her before youre ready
shit i dont know
he looks at her
youre really hot and im obviously attracted to you but i guess the best i can do is eventually find this piece of paper and call you and hope i
help in some small way with your career and be happy about that
anna takes this in
janine walks in from work to her construction site home
she peeks into the dining room where she sees her cherry wood dining table covered in a thick layer of dust
she waits for a response
she starts to brush the dust off with her hands
so janine drops her work things and heads out the side door of the house to a storage area
there are cans of paint bags of cement some tarps
janine grabs a tarp when she sees on a window ledge next to a folding chair an aluminum foil ashtray
she stares at them for a moment then heads back inside
close on a torn business card taped back together
the name on the card is jarrad montrose
gigi sits staring at the card
she reaches for the phone and then thinks the better of it
finally she grabs the receiver picks it up and dials
hi this is gigi
alex sits in his office
he talks into his cell
i had the umm dentist pen
im really sorry to bug you
i just i thought you had some really good insights the other night and i had a question
okay maybe i need to be harsh conor is never going to be interested in you
no i know
this is about she looks at the card jarrad
you have a sec
so i meet him at happy hour and he was completely charming lemme guess he said the only thing happy about this hour is you
he may have used some derivative of that
so he says hes going to call but then gave me his card and hes not interested
you dont even know if he called did he
but the thing is i honestly think hes expecting my call
he said look forward to hearing from you and not look forward to talking to you
i mean do you hear the connotations
tyrone appears in alexs doorway
alex this is jacked
the hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a white shirt this shirt is white
tyrone points to a very small white insignia on an otherwise black shirt
alex shuts the door on him
this shit is white
if a guy gives you his phone number instead of taking yours hes not interested
he took mine first but then he and if a guy wants to see you he will see you
i once called lauren bells until i got the right one
as it turned out her ass looked really huge in daylight
is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women
dont call him
he doesnt like you
again with the sensitivity
just trying to help
gigi hangs up re tears up jarrads card
close on happy birthday mom written across a cake
as the candles are blown out we widen to reveal anna and conor siting at a cheap picnic table in a tiny backyard across from maya annas mom
as maya refills her glass from a bottle of wine anna grabs a gift from her bag hands it to her mom
oh sweetie you didnt have to get me anything
mom you always say that and i always get you something
maya takes a big sip of wine not her first as she tears open the gift which is clearly a record album
its no big deal
what is it
maya shows him the album tim buckleys starsailor
here put on my favorite
anna takes the album and heads through the screen door
did anna ever tell you i knew tim buckley
she did not
song to the siren plays as anna returns to the table
we met at a coffee shop in
i had no idea who he was
but he had this big mop of hair and these eyes that just looked past you and through you and into you all at the same time
complete interest and disinterest
it was amazing
maya pulls out a cigarette and lights it
of course i was with annas father at the time so you know
another opportunity missed
mom please its the truth
i knew them all
robert plant harry nilsson graham parsons
to conor have you seen the pictures of me from when i was annas age
umm i dont think so sweetie go get that picture you know the one anna just looks at her pleadingly
your mothers asking you to do something for her on her birthday
anna goes inside
maya looks to conor takes a sip
youll see we look strikingly similar
my lips may be a bit fuller but
she leans back puts out her cigarette as anna returns with a picture
she hands it to conor
insert maya in her early twenties
black and white somewhere in new york
the resemblance to anna is scary
so thats what were dealing with here for reference
imagine meeting someone who looks like that in a coffee shop
conor looks down at the picture then back up to anna
thats funny because i mean i guess i kinda did
anna and i met at a restaurant
that serves coffee
so not a coffee shop but
still he looks from maya to anna
maya stands up
but if were comparing stories indicating with her glass shes no me and youre no tim buckley
with that maya heads inside
anyone need a refill
anna looks to conor apologetically
he just smiles
anna and conor walk to the front door of her apartment
thanks again for coming with me
you make it so much easier
are you kidding
i like your mom
yeah well cools not always what youre looking for in a mom
conor smiles understanding
so you want another foot rub
but its awkward
im just beat
i wanna put on sweats and get in bed
id be into that
anna gives him a smile opens her front door
ill call you tomorrow ok
she gives him a kiss and goes inside
trent early s talks to the camera as he drives his ford explorer
hes cute but trying a smidge too hard goatee leather cord necklace he bought in cancun etc
if a girl is into you shes sleeping with you
and if after a month two months at the very outside shes not sleeping with you she does not like you
i guess the trick is how to spot this girl early so you dont waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out that its never gonna happen
so ive got some signs about how to spot this girl gleaned from my own experience of course
a girl will never sleep with you if she calls you cuddly or dependable she pops a zit in front of you her name is amber or christine she takes
a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers in dates
i know its not scientific but im just saying you were warned
alex knocks and opens the door in one motion
hey dude you here
alex heads to the fridge opens it and looks in
he pulls two beers out shuts the fridge and turns to find conor standing there
hes wearing a really tight shiny shirt and even tighter very blue jeans
or an apple martini
conor grabs the beer and opens it
need i ask
its for work
im trying to expand my client base
by pretending youre gay
by being more gay friendly
or in real estate terms by becoming gay adjacent
i may have to use that
conor heads back toward his room
im gonna try something else
this may be too much
i dont know
you dress like that and youre already seeing a girl who wont sleep with you i think maybe you can pull it off
its not that she wont sleep with me douchebag
i have slept with her
its just you know she
wont sleep with you anymore
conor reappears now wearing a french connection type pretty much yeah
re his new outfit so what do you think
alex gives him the once over
i think youre gonna have to beat em away with a stick you hot sexy man
conor rolls his eyes and heads back into his room
alex laughs to himself and takes another sip of beer
leather couch framed orioles jersey typical bachelor pad
gigi is making out with gregory s
who would have thought that a random girl from pilates would fix me up with such a good kisser
back at you sister
they make out some more
i cant wait to kiss you again
were kissing right now
but next time
the second date kiss is way more intimate
as they start kissing again well im going out of town tomorrow so ill be out of touch for a bit
gregory starts pulling off gigis top
gigi pulls away deftly
would you excuse me a quick second
too many diet cokes
gigi makes a beeline down the hall
gigi dials her cell as she goes through gregorys bathroom cabinets
alex is also mid makeout on his leather couch with a hot woman
the phone rings
alex grabs it
hey sorry to bug you again
to his hot lady would you excuse me a second babe
alex walks into the hallway
im making out with a guy pg stuff and then he mentions hes going out of town so hes gonna be out of touch
but maybe he is going out of town
the arab emirates
where is he going that he has to be out of touch
gigi opens the bathroom door and shouts down the hall
where are you going out of town to again
so now what
im just supposed to run from every guy who doesnt like me
theres not going to be anyone left
ok i dont know why im saying this but i actually think i know a nice guy who you might like
hes a friend of my brothers
well all meet for a drink itll be good
so im in his bathroom right now
what do i now
you gotta come out eventually
but id really take my time
let him sweat
he hangs up
gigi finds some crest whitestrips and with determination decides to apply them
annas rolling up mats etc
as a sweaty ben approaches
so we ran into each other
you came to my class
i didnt know it was your class
you called and asked me
but you didnt call me back
because you said not to call back if it was my class
which it was
we ran into each other
a couple of innocent folks by happenstance doing their daily workout near one another
as anna picks up her bag and walks past him wanna swim
ben watches her go not sure shes serious
big indoor pool
clearly closed lights off
anna opens the door with a key ben follows
i was just thinking why cant we be friends
am i not allowed to make friends anymore
am i not allowed to be friends with hot people
what kind of reverse prejudice is that
i hear you
am i supposed to not be friends with a guy just because hes married and happens to have this insane smile and this ass that makes me want to dry
i think i just fell in love
a girl who talks about a dry hump
classy is lame
anna sits at the edge of the pool
so friends right
and with that anna pulls off her top
and then her sweats
and totally naked slides into the pool
you wanna come in
i dont trust myself
you can just watch
you may be the best friend ive ever had
anna laughs and then dunks her head under the water
ben comes in the front door drops his gym bag
janine sits on the couch flipping through a magazine
he leans in to kiss her on the cheek
she does not look happy
honey you smell different
ben pulls back smoothly
i dont know
well thats an odd thing to say
she looks at him
he tries to coolly meet her gaze
maybe its the ashtray and cigarettes i found
in the side yard
what part of my dad died of lung cancer is hard for you to wrap your brain around
do not lie to me ben
are you serious
we have like eight thousand undocumented workers in this house daily
you find cigarettes and you automatically assume theyre mine
honey im not lying
and you are really freaking out
i think the renovation is getting to you because nothing is going on
just please relax
ben walks away
off janine wanting to believe him
ben walks to a boat at the end of the dock
he stands unsure before deciding to knock on the side of the boat
neil emerges unshaven possibly unshowered
my first visitor
this boat is sick
how come you never invited me out before
well this was supposed to be just for beth and i for our retirement
leave our jobs
sell the house
neil is clearly having a tough time
ben doesnt know what to say
theyre silent for a second
where are my manners
permission to board granted
ill show you around
ben smiles steps on to the boat
close on a cigarette being lit
widen to reveal neil smoking on the upper deck of his boat steering it out into the bay
ben stands across from him looking on
re cigarette sorry
neil switches to his left hand away from ben
so janine sent you to check on me
any message from beth
ben shakes his head no
neil seems disappointed
i think shes been busy getting ready for her sisters funeral though so
her sisters what
her sisters wedding
what did i say
neil is now laughing hard
you said funeral
no i didnt
shit did i
neil laughs harder
even ben sees the humor
the marriage thing is weird man
i never thought beth would give me an ultimatum
thats what women do
thats how janine got you to bite the bullet
neil looks at ben curious
do you regret it
so youre happy
youd say youre happily married
ben looks at neil as if hes crazy
i love janine
neil takes a drag and looks out over the harbor
we pan down one of the long tables to find beth smacking a crab with a mallet
the others at the table turn to look at her annoyed
and thats when we see there seems to be a party and speech underway
now i know when my cousin paige says those vows tomorrow there are going to be hearts breaking all over the world
beths sister paige smiles
so keep in mind her sister beth is still on the market
the cousin winks at beth
beth goes white
sure shes an older model but shes still got a lot of miles left in her
but dont stay on the lot too long bethie or next years models will ken murphy s nearly tramples guests to grab the mic
ok thats enough of the speeches
time to eat
so enjoy the crab
and the yellow stuff is not hot mustard its the crabs hepatopancreas
mixed reaction from the crowd as ken puts the mic down
he starts to return to his table when he sees beth trying to make a sneaky exit
he catches up to her
bethie your cousin jay has always been a jackass
and even hes married
so youll get married a little bit later than some people
you never did anything the way every one else did it and thats what ive always thought was so great about you
im your oldest daughter and im the only one not married
if this was fiddler on the roof youd have to sacrifice me or something
ken laughs and puts his arm around beth
when everyone else was just going to camp at the y you borrowed my new york times found some arts camp in the berkshires wrote away for information then got
accepted on your own
you were nine
you never did things the way everyone else did
because thats you
thats why youre my favorite daughter
beths eyes go wide
i dont think youre supposed to say that
well i dont give a shit
im retired and ill say what i want
ill say it into the mic if you want thats ok
its true though
gigi sits sipping a drink alone when alex comes in the door and goes directly to her table
sorry im late
i like a little time before a blind date prepare myself mentally remind myself not to tell the story about my molars hes not coming
alex motions to the waitress to bring them another round
cant wait to hear that story about the molars though
how can he already not like me
i screwed up
i told bill it was thursday but i meant tuesday
gigi is disappointed
the waitress drops off their drinks
they toast then observe the scene at the bar
im stuck here with a guy who cant distinguish tuesday from thursday and meanwhile this girl motions to girl at the bar shes probably meeting her soul mate as we
the girl is standing between two guys
how do you know
see the guy trying to work the tom cruise thing
you cannot tell from a cursory glance that hes not interested
actually i can
i manage a restaurant
i see this stuff go down every night
watch as if on cue tom cruise guy bangs his elbow into the girl hard causing her to spill her drink
tom cruise guy sees but doesnt acknowledge
alex looks smug
man you have a gift
and check out droopy dawg on her other side
he can buy her drinks all night and shell insist theres no spark
maybe there isnt
you need a spark
the spark thing is bullshit
guys invented the spark so they could not call and treat you kind of bad and keep you guessing and then convince you that the anxiety and fear that it
creates in you is actually a spark
and you all buy it
you love it
you all thrive on it because you all love drama
so you dont wait until the last minute on deadlines or on phone bills because you love the drama of not knowing whether youll make it
and let me guess when you were stalking conor that night were you obsessing about him calling for days even though the date was just kind of mediocre
see you thrive on drama
you gotta be more like me if a girl likes me great if not there are plenty more like her probably with smaller pores and bigger implants
they continue drinking and observing the scene
why are you sharing all this inside dating information with me again
i like you
dont start doodling my name on your binder
i just mean i like you like i like basset hounds
theyre kinda pathetic so you want to cheer them up
again with the sensitivity
alex smiles at her
gigi cant help but smile back
janine walks down the hallway with javier stocky her contractor
shes inspecting the crown molding
it looks good
he does good work
hes very good
janine stops and looks at javier
he looks back at her
javier if i asked you an honest question do you think you could give me an honest answer
i think so
because i think some of your guys have been smoking
janine looks at javier
its awkwardly silent
is that the question
it seemed like a statement
the question part was implied i didnt really hear it in the inflection javier have your guys been smoking or not
my guys dont smoke on the job site
theyre all good guys
are you sure your guys arent sneaking around here
and lying to me
shes starting to freak javier out
im pretty sure
i need you to be honest with me javier
because i cant have someone lying to me
to my face
under my roof
on my time
very softly thats a lot of prepositions
janine does not hear him and barrels on i mean there is no reason for that kind of dishonesty is there
i mean we made promises to one another
javier looks at her what the hell is she talking about
what i mean is we had a contract
which is like making promises to each other right
maybe i should just get back to work
javier starts to leave
but were good here right
me and you
blank stare from javier
janine slaps on a smile
the molding really does look great
javier gives a forced smile and heads back to work
two well built men skip and larry sip from bottles of volvic water as they wander through a kitchen inspecting the cabinetry
conor comes into to frame wearing a toned down version of his gay friendly clothes
hello my name is conor
please sign in whenever you get a chance
he gestures to a guest book on the kitchen island next to which anna stands
conor joins her
this is insane
youre like the liza minelli of real estate
your friend marys a genius
the house is teeming with gay couples opening closets admiring floors munching on complimentary cookies
you got a class
just some stuff
see you later
conor goes in for a hug but annas not ready for it so he just ends up grabbing her
she leaves conor tries to play it off looks around the room
skip and larry look at him sympathetically
shes holding out on you isnt she
im not sure i get your meaning
she wont sleep with you
its written all over your puppy dog face
conor looks at them decides not to fight it
its killing me
skip and larry move closer larry grabs a plate
here have a cookie
i just i have no idea what shes doing
i cannot read her signals at all
we used to sleep together all the time
well thats not true i dont know why i said that it wasnt all the time
but it did happen i know im not making this up
and then out of nowhere it stops
but she still calls she stops by she sleeps on my couch she wants a massage she leaves cute messages but it never goes anywhere
i mean what is she doing
honestly we may not have the best insight
gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals
like heres i want to sleep with you
he looks at larry
larry looks back at him
they dont break their gaze
one two three thats it
three seconds or more its on
heres i dont want to sleep with you
skip look at larry again
larry meets his gaze
one two he looks away no
thanks for playing
its that simple
thats no help at all
but listen i can tell you this
gay or straight youre not going to get anywhere by being inactive
she clearly likes you maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something
so the next time youre in the position dont take no for an answer
skip looks at larry concerned
that sounds like felonious advice
let me rephrase
dont take maybe for an answer
conor takes this in thats not a bad idea
cute studio apartment
and ben is in the bed
anna walks in from the bathroom in a robe
ben watches her
this is bad
i am so into you
she joins him in bed
im lying here watching you and i seriously have never felt this way before
i have to forcibly make my brain stop thinking about you
i mean all the time
she looks at ben
hes not smiling
because i dont do stuff like this
stuff like what
like having sex with women who are not my wife
first of all im not women
im just one
whats second of all
i didnt have a second of all
i thought second of all was going to make me feel better
second of all i cant stop thinking about you either
they look at each other for a long moment
i have to tell her
i have to tell her
annas eyes light up but she tries to cover
i dont want to push you to i want to be with you
and i cant do that if im lying to her
you know whats best
as ben pulls her to him she lets a smile take hold
louis s with a kind but very wise face talks to the camera in his formal doorman attire standing in front of a posh upper east side building
heres the thing my daughter is happily married with kids and running a tanning salon on staten island
but if she wasnt id tell her the same thing id like to tell a lot of the girls that come in and out of this building on the arm
of a married guy
and here is that advice get stocks cash annuities a deed in your name
dont settle for flowers and a shopping spree at bendels
think to the future
we all know that none of these guys is gonna leave his society wife and let her keep half the money and the classic eight on park avenue
so i wanna tell these young ladies as long as you only have the guy for a finite period of time get something that can last
because i guarantee you he wont
and thats the best fatherly advice i can give
mary and anna in sweats and ugg boots and dirty hair both load their carts with cheap beauty products
im not picking out china patterns or anything but ive never felt anything like this before
this is crazy
i cant believe hes gonna leave his wife for you
no hes not leaving his wife for me
hes just hes a good guy
and he cant really explore what we could be if hes lying to her
mary looks at her
hes kind of leaving his wife for me
is this crazy
this is totally crazy
we barely know each other
i dont know
remember becca my sisters friend
some guy waits on her at bennigans by the end of the night they both knew they had found the one
youre totally right
it can happen
not for me
well what about texter
texter has yet to make any verbal contact
i mean this guy could have had surgery that left him without a voice box breathing through a stoma and id never know because i never actually hear his voice
i doubt he has a stoma thats not the point
the point is i cant text
im not charming via text
my sarcasm doesnt come through i cant type fast enough on the little phone keyboard so dont text
its not just texting
its email and voicemail and snail mail thats just mail whatever
none of its working
ive had a guy leave a voicemail for me at work and then i call him back at home and he emails me to my blackberry and then i text
him to his cell and then he emails me to my home account from the plane phone and it just totally gets out of hand
i miss the days where you had one phone number with one answering machine that housed one cassette tape and either the cassette tape had a message from the guy
or it didnt
now you have to go around checking all your portals and get rejected by seven different technologies
anna who is trying a different shade of nail polish on each finger calmly looks up at mary
so what about the singer guy
yeah i like him
i felt like we connected
gigi sits on the couch wrapped in a blanket eating graham crackers and watching some kind of wonderful on tv
the phone rings
even in the office we can hear the din of the bar scene
where am i supposed to be
its saturday night
you wont let me go out with guys who dont like me
its kind of limiting
i was just calling to let you know im having a party at my place next weekend
you should come
gigi considers this
i dont know
wont conor be there
might be kinda awkward
hes in dc for the weekend at some real estate conference
but theres gonna be a bunch of single guys
so i will have plenty of chances to be awkward
ill be there
ill talk you through it
so the party is it like a big party more of a mellow hang or a crash outside alexs office
gotta go i think someone just dropped wine glasses
gigi hangs up and goes back to watching her movie
close on the tv screen as mary stuart masterson as watts and eric stoltz as keith hang out in a garage
amanda jones is no minor leaguer wholl be swept off her feet at the touch of your amateur lips
i think i can handle it
i was just gonna work on it with you but if youre comfortable
how do you work on it
pretend im a girl ok
i mean pretend im her
gigi sits up
a light bulb has gone off
as she watches keith and watts kiss on screen a smile crosses her face
gigi blows in dumps her things and turns to janine
hes into me
i knew it
she hugs gigi whos this now
its totally clear to me now
from some kind of wonderful
wait isnt mary stuart masterson watts
so why arent you watts
im eric stoltz
alex is watts because watts helps eric stoltz go on a date with amanda jones but really shes in love with eric stoltz herself
wait so whos amanda jones
i guess conor at first
now men in general
but thats not the point
the point is hes into me
you know i knew there had to be a reason he was spending all that time with you
its so obvious now there are so many signs
oooh gimme the signs
i love to hear about the signs
janine rolls her chair closer to gigis desk
at first they were small like when i first called he said good to hear from you totally good sign
and then the next time i called he was with a woman but he still took the call
and talked to me for a while
you know it was a woman
he called her babe
a guy does not leave a woman to talk to another woman unless theres something going on
and it gets more obvious
i mean please there was no guy he was going to fix me up with
the fix up was him
he shows up without this fictitious bill character and the two of us basically have a date
and then he calls me to invite me to a party at his place
he so likes you
janine rolls her chair up to gigis computer screen
lets look up places for your destination wedding
would you guys wanna do napa valley ive always wanted to go there
gigi laughs but doesnt fight as janine starts searching
mary sits at her desk surrounded by her gays
they are all looking at her computer screen
theres no way hes already called we only met for coffee last night
i mean we video ichatted
while holding coffee
kinda like having coffee
nathan hands her the phone
just call your voice mail
and he told me he had a gig last night so he probably got in real late
did i tell you he was singer
mary cradles the receiver with her shoulder and dials
mary hits the speakerphone button
singing in a sexy voice maaaary
mary mary mary maaaary
oh my maaary
mary is clearly charmed
the gays all swoon
i just got hard
the other guys shush him
hey mary its jude
just wanted to tell you again how special it was to meet you
so call me back
hell sing to your babies
mary basks in the attention
then another beep
singing from speakerphone jeeeeny
jenny jenny jenny jeeeeny
all heads whip around at stare at the speaker phone
hey jenny its jude
just wanted to oh shit what number did i call
some rustling noises and a hang up followed by a dial tone
mary stares at the phone then pushes a button
they all head wordlessly back to work
close on two seemingly identical planks of wood
we pull back to reveal ben and janine in the wide aisle of home depot as janine really studies the two pieces of wood
finally she points to one of them
thats the laminate
that one isnt real hardwood floor
but it looks exactly the same at like one one hundredth of the cost
janine considers this
i still wanna go with the real wood
but you cant even tell the difference
thats not the point
then whats the point
i just dont like the way its pretending to be wood
if youre not wood then dont try to look like wood
i dont think its pretending ben is making light
but janine is all business
its a lie
just be up front tell people what you really are
ben takes this in
his cheeks start to burn
youre totally right
maybe we should look at the grills and come back
as she starts to steer their giant cart away ben just stands there fused to the ground
finally i slept with someone
janine stops doesnt say anything
i heard you
she doesnt turn to face him
you tell me this in home depot because you know how i hate a public scene
that is not why i i knew it
i knew it
im so sorry
and its you thats been smoking too isnt it
why does that matter
janine turns to ben
she is irate
janine just stares at him fuming
look i talked to neil and he said i could stay on his boat for a while if now janines eyes go wide with disbelief
and now you want to move out
youre like what leaving me
ben looks confused but is trying to roll with it
i just assumed that you wouldnt want me to were not going to deal with this
were not going to figure out a way to work through this
i just assumed that once i told you you would want me out
is that what you want
almost a whisper no
she heads down the aisle with the cart
ben follows confused that didnt go how he thought it would
the lush grounds surrounding a beautiful turn of the century mansion
the procession of a wedding has just begun
two adorable flower girls start things off
then beths sister laura processes down the aisle with her husband steven
beths sister catherine and her husband george are next
big smiles all around
then beth appears at the end of the aisle with her escort buddy a year old chocolate lab wearing a coral bow tie
beth forces a smile as she processes with buddy who stops to piss on a chair leg
beth is not happy
a lavish reception
beth takes her seat next to dan s
dan looks over at beths place card
you must be beth
ive heard a lot about you from paige
id been lobbying for weeks to be seated next to her single sister
so you are looks at his placecard dan
uh sort of
well im actually a wiccan
so i have a magickal name
its brother phoenix east horse
but i didnt know if that would fit on a card
beth slaps on a fake smile and grabs for the wine
a party is in full swing
typical affair for someone in their late s mediocre food but decent alcohol
gigi stands somewhat uncomfortably near the chex mix
she tries smiling at a tall girl who ignores her
so gigi continues absently and compulsively shoving handfuls of chex mix into her mouth
it makes your breath stink
gigi looks up to see nathan and bruce marys gay coworkers who are now decked out in full on saturday night gay mode standing next to her
i learned the hard way
i made out with a guy after eating like a bag of the stuff
he said my breath smelled like trout
gigi puts her handful of chex mix back
thanks for the tip
that was rude
and that guy i made out with was a total asshole
you want me to smell you
im sure you dont smell like trout
she cups her hand and surreptitiously checks her breath
this is bruce
how do you guys know alex
our friend mary heard about it from some guy named conor
gigi smiles in recognition
how do you know alex
i hope i mean im pretty sure something is about to happen between us
so youre here as like a guest or like his date
i hate that when you dont know if youre a date so you dont know if you should bring a friend or if youre like co hosting or if you
should stay til the end to have alone time suddenly a look of doubt sweeps across gigis face
he didnt really say
she reflexively grabs for the chex mix and starts gorging on it again
nathan stops her
but im sure im more than just a guest
i mean there have been signs
i did get a slight waft of trout though
take a mint
he reaches in his pocket
gigi looks at him gratefully
dinner is over
the dance floor is crowded
the bride paige is out there
beths dad is dancing with her mom
beths dad gives beth a wink as she heads onto to the dance floor with dominic s and fat
so wheres neil
we actually broke up
you guys were together for like ten years
but yes a long time
they continue to dance
too bad cousins cant marry huh
cuz then we could maybe eeew dominic gross
beth swats dominic on the arm and he laughs
and then they are distracted by a commotion on the dance floor
everyone has stopped dancing
they are looking to the floor near the band
beth pushes her way through to see
the place is packed
gigi is smashed into a hallway trying to look relaxed
alex comes up behind her
i had no idea it would be such a madhouse
gigi turns to him and smiles
are any guys hitting on you
do you need me to evaluate their level of interest
they were gay
even i know that their level of interest was probably low
well too bad bill couldnt make it
i still think you guys would hit it off
gigi smiles knowingly on to alexs scam
air quotes bill
alex doesnt know how to take that
anyway im on my way to put out some more liquor
but it looks like the food could use some refreshing he looks at the food table
everything is empty
would you mind helping
i mean just refill the chips and stuff
you mean kind of like co hosting
gigi looks elated
alex looks confused
the chips are on top of the fridge
he walks away
gigi smiles big
the party is now even more crowded
gigi weaves her way through the crowd
shes deftly holding six drinks passing them off to various people as she walks
she stops at the food table rearranges a few bowls
she catches alexs eye across the room hes talking to friends
she smiles and gives a thumbs up
he gives an awkward thumbs up back and returns to his conversation
gigi is in the kitchen mixing up some dip
she chats with a couple of party goers very much at home
really great party
when alex said he wanted to have a party i was like lets do it
thanks so much for having us
an attractive tall girl enters the kitchen and starts looking in the cupboards
gigi watches with interest
can i help you find something
the tall girl finds a bowl in the cabinet and grabs it
no thats ok
i got it
she brings the bowl over to the counter and starts emptying gigis dip into the bowl
gigi is thrown
thanks for mixing that up
alex asked me to get the dip together
thanks for getting it started
gigis face grows red
the tall girl tastes the dip
hmmm could use a little more dill
then the tall girl deftly grabs the dip and chips and heads back out to the party
gigi looks to the confused party goers not pleased
bruce and nathan wave to gigi as they leave
people are getting coats the crowd is definitely thinning
gigi spots alex in the kitchen and makes a beeline
when someones underwear ends up in your toaster oven its been a good party
alex looks at the toaster oven and laughs
i guess people had fun
then the tall girl emerges
alex you want me to start cleaning up
gigi stares daggers at her
thats sweet of you
but i thought id stick around so ill take care of it
i got it
the tall girl shoots gigi a dirty look as she grabs a trash bag
gigi grabs one too
alex looks mystified
knock yourselves out
it is really late
everyones gone except the tall girl and alex who sit on the couch playing a nba live on the xbox
gigi enters from the kitchen
i think ive rounded up the last of the beer bottles
the tall girl and alex do not look up from the game
gigi stands there awkwardly
so umm what game is this
they ignore her
she looks around
well maybe i should just you know i mean its past three and yes
alex tosses down his controller
you are sensational
the tall girl beams
did you say its past three
man i gotta go
gigi suppresses a smile
the tall girl gives alex a hug and heads out
gigi finally alone with alex sits next to him on the couch
theyre silent for a moment
thanks for staying and helping clean up but i really gotta get to bed
is that an invitation
that was cheesy
im not good at this
but then before alex knows whats happening gigi is lunging at him
she puts his face in her hands and starts to kiss him
really kiss him
finally gigi pulls away
she looks breathless
alex looks a little afraid
i knew it
i knew it
the best relationships grow out of friendships
she goes in to kiss him again
this time he stops her
now you and i are in a relationship
well id say if were not at relationship station ship were at least on the track
alex gets up off the couch
and why would you think that exactly
because there were you know signs
ummm it was good to hear from me
you talked to me even when you were with a girl
i felt something
she trails off
alex is not pleased
what are you talking about
what have i been saying since i met you
if a guy wants to date you he will make it happen
why would you do this
i thought you were watts
alex doesnt even hear her
why do women do this
why do they build this stuff up in their minds take each little thing a guy does and twist it into something else gigi stands there embarrassed taking alexs berating
id rather be like that than like you
maybe i dissect each little thing and put myself out there too much and maybe i even thrive on the drama of it all but at least that means i
you think youve won because women are expendable to you
sure you dont get hurt or make an ass of yourself that way but you dont fall in love that way either
you havent won alex
gigi grabs her bag
i may do a lot of stupid shit but i know im a lot closer to finding someone than you are
gigi turns and heads out the door
gigi looks at the phone and then finally dials
hey janine im sorry its so late but i just dont start picking out your bridesmaid dress ok
i know this isnt the first time this has happened its just this one wasnt about whether he liked me
i just really liked him
gigi hangs up lays on the bed snaps off the light
ken murphy beths dad lies in bed in a notre dame sweatshirt with papers and books surrounding him
beth clears his breakfast dishes off of the bed
you want anything else
less of that cardboardy brown stuff
more regular people food
the cardboardy brown stuff is called whole grain bread
maybe you could just fry me up a couple sausage links
people who have just had heart attacks generally are not advised to eat animal fat stuffed in synthetic casings
ken looks at her with a wry smile
did i tell you that youre not only my favorite daughter but youre also the prettiest
so much better looking than those other dogs
its not gonna work this time
but i appreciate the effort
beth takes his dirty dishes and heads for the door
beth hauls the dishes downstairs and through the den where steven lauras husband is on the couch intently watching the golf channel
grab me a beer if youre going that way
beth rolls her eyes
and a little plate of cold cuts if there are any left
beth just keeps on walking
beth walks by paige on the couch and devon paiges new husband on the floor surrounded by a mess of vinyl records
he has an old bobby darin tune blaring
you might wanna kill the volume just a smidge
my mom is finally taking a nap
you think your dad really wants to hang on to all this vinyl
my collection could use a bunch of these
turn it the fuck down
both devon and paige look at her stunned
the kitchen is a total mess
beth sets the dishes down in a precarious pile of other dishes and sees her sisters laura and catherine at the kitchen table
i finally got mom to lay down in the spare room
all we have left to eat is some old jelly and ramen noodles so after i tackle some of these dishes maybe we can go to the store
our new brother is trying to co opt dads property before hes even dead
and laura your husband would really like a beer to go with his fifth consecutive hour of the golf channel
beth looks up
laura is pointing to catherine who has her head in her hands
shes crying softly
its all gonna be ok
what am i gonna do without dad
first of all hes upstairs watching oprah after the show
and second of all you have us
but hes always been the one whos there for me
what about your husband
where the hell is he
playing ultimate frisbee
his team may make the quarterfinals
beth rolls her eyes
the dishes crash in the sink
janine sits at beths desk across from gigi who stares at her in disbelief
janine fiddles with a tile sample
do you know who it is
shaking her head no it doesnt matter
so are you going to leave him
gigi hes my husband
hes not just some guy that didnt call me back
and he did admit it to me
he didnt wait to get caught
that takes courage
gigi is clearly stung
i didnt mean that
i know alex was not just some guy
its my fault you know
im willing to accept my responsibility in this
i forced him into getting married
he wasnt ready
janine this is not your fault
i used to be fun
i was fun when we met
youre still fun
janine looks at gigi the tears come
we never have sex anymore
lots of couples got through lulls
we never have sex
realistically what did i expect him to do
i dont think thats really she looks down at the tile in her hand
this is too small
i gotta tell javier
i gotta go
tell beth i took a personal day
janine grabs her purse heads out as gigi looks on
mariel s highly manicured upper class type sits on a yacht in what looks to be the french riviera
my first husband was unimpressive
i found him in bed with his big breasted secretary when i came home early from the maldives
so unoriginal it made me feel sorry for him
my second husband was a pinch more creative
cheated on me with my sister but made me believe that i was insane for being suspicious
at last some intrigue some mind games though my sisters two year old eventually gave them up
but my last husband he was a gem
a veritable master at covering his tracks
i poured over his phone records intercepted his credit card bills had him followed on countless occasions and never found a single shred of evidence
it wasnt until he died that i found out about the property he owned with his austrian mistress
but the real master i have to say is me
three husbands countless boyfriends and i havent been caught yet
anna squeezes bens hand as they stride down the hallway to his office
anna is trying to suppress a smile
oh my god oh my god oh my god
ben smoothly extricates his hand from annas
he nods to coworkers as they pass
it was all you babe
oh my god oh my god oh my god
ben smiles at anna as they round the corner of the corridor to his office
he goes in and she follows
ben deftly shuts and locks the door behind them
this is really good news
i cannot believe this
he liked my demo
did you hear what he said
when he said it was hauntingly beautiful
did you hear that part
i was sitting right there
ben smiles and pulls anna to him
thank you so much
with that they start to kiss
it gets heated
clothes start to come off
they make their way over to the leather sofa
how is it that every time i see your body im shocked at how beautiful it is
anna smiles at the compliment
she starts to work on his shirt when someone tries to open the locked door
dana i need to go over the offering statement
can i get a few minutes
ben continues to remove his shirt as he talks
its not dana
literally freezes on top of anna
ben frantically puts his hands over annas mouth
then working with speed and precision he gathers all of annas things and shoves her naked into the closet
there isnt enough room to stand so she has to sit
she looks up at ben he closes the closet door
he goes to the door of the office
i told dana to get this lock fixed
why do you even lock it
ben re buttons his shirt gives the office a once over
id never get anything done if i didnt
finally ben opens the door and janine is standing there smiling
can i come in
she makes a show of closing and locking the door
what are you doing
ben goes to sit behind his desk confused
janine clearly a little nervous goes to straddle ben at his desk chair
her skirt is way too long to do this so she has to regroup and hike up the skirt
ben glances over at the closet
janine what are you doing
i dont know
i just thought maybe we could you know relight the fire
honey did you hear what i just said
i gotta get this offering statement out
ben picks up some papers but janine is not giving up
look i am trying here
do you want to save our marriage or dont you
janine looks at ben
ben is silent
anna sits holding back tears as she listens closely
of course i do
then youll let me do this
then a zipper opening a chair creaking yeah just like that yeah
we hold on anna as she sits there stonefaced
alex has the staff of about assembled for the pre shift meeting
he consults a clipboard as he talks
ok tyrone you bus through and pitch in with the servers when you no
im on thru
im always on through
been working here months doing through
luis you take through
the staff looks at each other perplexed
luis quit like months ago
alex rifles through his papers not sure what hes looking for
he slams his clipboard on the bar
do we even need to have this meeting
does this serve any purpose
the group voice their opinions a resounding no
get to work
the group disperses alex heads around the bar
he sees kelli ann walking away and calls after her
hey kelli ann any calls for me
since you asked me minutes ago
no not a lot of phone traffic
kelli ann starts to turn away as she sees alex grab his cell phone look at it then put it down
he grabs a beer takes a swig then grabs his cell phone again staring at it willing it to ring
he puts it down again
a huge smile grows on kelli anns face
oh my god
its happened to you
what has happened to me
whats her name
the girl alex
theres no girl
alex takes his beer and heads down the bar
you cant hide it man
i know strung out and you are strung out
please this is amazing
cant focus right
jumping every time your phone rings checking your email times a day
wishing you could write songs
feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations
alex stops at the office door
its always the same
and it has happened to you my friend
alex looks at kelli ann her words settling in
kelli ann smiles and as she walks away welcome to my world asshole
alex takes this in knowing shes right
janine now fully dressed hovers by the door
ben is back at his desk eyes on his computer
you sure i cant interest you in a little beef and broccoli
i really gotta get this stuff done
janine is clearly flailing
she starts to go
ill see you at home
i love you
she looks at ben
he has no choice
covering his anger i love you too
as soon as shes gone ben gets up shuts the office door and goes to the closet when the door i had no choice
what was i supposed to do when she you make me sick to my stomach
you are a disgusting excuse for a man anna pulls her clothes back on in a fury
i didnt want to do it anna
you know that its you i want to be with he puts out a hand to try to touch her
are you kidding me
you will never lay a hand on me again
i may just be a piss poor girl from dundalk who works at a gym but i am so too good for you
anna storms out
gigi sits on her couch a pile of bills in her lap most of which say late overdue etc
shes on the phone
dino thank you again for letting me pay over the phone
i assure you this late payment thing will never happen again
yep just trying to trim some of the drama out of my life
thats my other line
gigi clicks over
this is bill
ummm alexs friend
we were supposed to meet up but alex told me the wrong day
gigi lets this sink in
so you do exist
and id love to buy you dinner sometime if youre game
she puts on a smile
anna stands in the cluttered kitchen of her moms house
she writes out a check leaves it on the counter
she looks to the living room where maya sleeps on the couch
she watches her for a second struggling with a blanket before heading over to her
she crouches next to the couch helps her adjust the blanket
im gonna go
i left the check on the counter
it should at least get you through this month
maya opens her eyes and looks up at her smiling
i dont know what i would do without you
maya closes her eyes again
anna sits there watching her
annas eyes start to fill with tears quietly she begins crying
maya finally notices
baby whats the matter
maya struggles to sit up and hug her
anna sits next to her on the couch still trying to get it together
is it money
because you can take back the check if no its not that
i mean yes im broke but its not that
its just tearing up again im just so lost mom
ive been seeing this guy who is exciting and amazing and thoroughly unavailable
i thought he was the one but he turned out to be such an asshole
maya nods almost smiling
and then theres conor yeah
who im so horrible to
but he takes it
and hes there
but i just dont want to i dont know settle
like you think i did
anna looks at her mother guilty
well your father and i had a glorious life together
are you kidding
all you talk about are the things you didnt do the people you wish you could have been with the tim buckleys anything but the life you actually had
maya looks at her daughter
those are just dreams anna
anna tries to process this
now true i did not like your father at all when we met
or after we got married for that matter
but let me tell you this life with him was a hell of a lot better than life is without him
maya stands walks slowly toward the kitchen
there are worse things in life than settling
like wishing you had
anna considers this
anna lays on her bed staring at the ceiling
the doorbell rings anna gets up to answer it
almost as soon as she turns the knob conor is standing in the middle of her studio apartment
he is all amped up
she reaches up to give him a hug he doesnt go for it
see why did you call me sweetie
anna looks confused
because we always call each other that
anna doesnt have an answer for that
i want to say something ok
i mean we call each other sweetie and we fall asleep on the phone after talking for hours and i washed your hair for you after you had that shoulder
surgery and everything its like were together
i know that i let me finish
maybe its my fault
maybe i havent been clear about what i want
so let me be clear
i love hanging out but i am so attracted to you and i just i want both
i want to make love to you
i know that sounds kind of embarrassing coming out of my mouth i just freaked myself out too but its true
and im not sure what happened or why we stopped but i dont really care
i just conor is stunned
im talking about really doing this
like a full on relationship
did a bunch of gay people put you up to this
please stop talking
conor sleeps peacefully with his limbs wrapped around anna
anna lays on her back eyes wide open staring at the ceiling
shes clearly not at peace
all of beths sisters spouses steven devon and george sit on the couch watching basketball
take him out
this isnt some exhibition game
beth comes downstairs with another set of dirty dishes and walks past them to the kitchen
the guys are annoyed that she blocks their view
could you did anyone have time to run to the store
nah were good
we just got drive through
i didnt mean for you
beth annoyed goes into the kitchen
she puts down the dishes in shock
the kitchen is spotless
she looks to the sink and sees the back of a man doing the last of the dishes
he turns around
the dishes are all put away
theres a load of laundry still drying but the other one is folded on top of the washer
he goes to the fridge and opens it
i remembered what your dad likes but i tried to get healthy stuff too
beth just looks at neil stunned
ben told me
i just i wanted to help
with that tears start to roll out of beths eyes
neil goes to her and puts his arms around her
i know how much you love him
but its gonna be ok
janine pulls up in her land rover and gets out
as she approaches the house she stops in her tracks
all the scaffolding is gone
the house looks beautiful
she whips out her cell phone and dials
javier does this mean what i think it means
so when you say done you dont mean we still need plumbing in the upstairs bathrooms done you mean done done
wow youre amazing
ill call when i see it
she hangs up the phone steels herself and walks inside
as janine enters she cant believe her eyes
various shots as janine walks from room to room amazed
where there once were plastic sheets there are now walls with vintage wall paper
all the floors are immaculate the chandeliers sparkle its all perfect
she walks down halls and up staircases past end tables and mantles all covered with pictures of her and ben
nice and tasteful
she ends her tour in the master suite its huge
and though full of furniture the longer she stands there the more empty it begins to seem
her face transitions from delight to loneliness within a matter of seconds
she takes out her cell phone hesitates then dials
cut wide to reveal ben sitting on a ledge in front of the gym smoking a cigarette watching the passersby
hes clearly waiting for anna to arrive
his phone rings
he looks at it janine calling
he ignores the call takes another drag of his cigarette
with janine as the call goes to voice mail
she hangs up confused
she sits on the edge of the bed looking around the room not sure what to do with herself
she notices a pair of pants and jacket thrown over a chair goes to tidy it up
she picks up the jacket checks the pockets theyre empty
she grabs the pants takes them both to the walk in closet
she hangs up the jacket
and as she folds the pants over she hears something hit the ground
she looks down to find a pack of cigarettes
her face pales
she stares at it immobile
her face tightens her eyes well up
as she grabs two armfuls of his clothes off the racks and flies out of the closet
staircase she hurtles down the stairs throwing armfuls of clothes into the foyer
then she surveys the scene and not satisfied rushes back up the stairs
hallway as she flies back into the bedroom she sees herself in the antique mirror hanging in the hallway
without even thinking she grabs it from the wall and smashes it on the ground
she stands over it breathing heavily looking at the shattered glass
she exits frame and we hear her walk down the stairs the camera holding on the empty wall
after a beat we hear her walking back up the stairs she enters frame again holding a dustpan and broom
she kneels over and begins sweeping up her mess
neil lies on the bed reading
the room is pretty messy a lot of clothes strewn around
there is a knock at the door
neil gets up to answer it
its been a while since ive been here
turns out that boat in the next mooring looks like yours not yours
no its no problem
invited me in for a white wine spritzer
not sure he gets a lot of visitors
can i come in
neil ushers her in shuts the door
beth looks around
i wanted to thank you
for coming by my folks house
i really care about your dad
and i really love you
even if i cant give you what you want
youre what i want
neil looks at her unsure of her meaning
our life together is what i want
your love is what i want
did you see those guys my sisters are married to
you are a better husband to me without being married than any of those real husbands will ever be
and thats enough for me
and youd really be ok if we take the marriage thing off the table
if you promise to love me and be committed to me
i always have wait im not done
and snake the shower drain when my hair clogs it and let me eat wheat thins in bed
so i get to move back in
but you cannot bring those
she points to his pants a raggedy pair of cargo pants
youre just mad at me and youre taking it out on the pants
look i gotta win something
i let you win the big battle so throw me a bone
were not getting married but im chucking the pants
we both win
they kiss again
gigi sits on her bed head flung upside down blow drying her hair
the phone rings but gigi doesnt hear it
alex in his office paces as he talks into the phone
i was just wondering how you were doing
its been a little while since weve talked and i was wondering how you were doing
alex looks up
tyrone is watching him shaking his head
alex motions for tyrone to leave
anyway i was hoping to talk to you
but youre out
so call me
thats enough now
he hangs up
tyrone is unimpressed
gigi flips her head back oblivious to the phone call and checks her hair
she heads out of the bedroom
conor and anna climb the stairs of a three story row house
a for sale sign is outside
you seriously get a ton of people bidding on this
i know its crazy
but its a neighborhood in transition
so that means what that hip gay people want to live out here
hip gay people young couples young families
conor smiles as anna heads into the house
weird it totally reminds me of the house i grew up in
i bet there is a anna goes into a little nook off of the kitchen
and pulls down a built in ironing board
we totally had this same thing
my mom would use this as her desk
isnt that bizarre
it was always covered with her little coupons and stuff
anna looks up to conor who is just watching her
so when do all the fabulous homosexual couples start arriving
well the open house is tomorrow
but i have this one buyer
i mean i want to see if his girlfriend likes it first his girlfriend
i mean i had this idea conor looks all of a sudden to be sweating
an idea for the open house
no an idea
for this house
and hopefully if you like it and things continue to you know
anna turns to face conor trying to put this together
i have a plan
i know where my life is going
and i want you to go with me
i mean im not saying you have to move in now or anything i just i dont want to buy a place that you couldnt at some point see yourself
conor takes her hands in his
anna starts to panic
so what do you think
i mean gut reaction
i always go with my gut when it comes to real estate or
anna looks at him
and at the pull down ironing board
she looks at the ironing board a long time before turning back to conor holding back tears
i cant do this conor
if its too fast no
i mean this
any of this
what youre saying what youre offering is what every girl wants
its what ive always wanted
its just anna looks at him for a long time not knowing how to say this
conor looks at her struggling and suddenly sees it in her face
the answer hes been looking for
it all dawns on him in an instant
you dont want it with me
anna nods sadly
conor takes this in
a long beat
so i have a question
is it too late to dial it back to before and just keep sleeping together
anna laughs and it breaks the tension
because i thought that really you know gelled
anna goes to conor and hugs him
your standard waterfront seafood restaurant
gigi sits across from bill nice looking if a bit conservative
so alex told me you work in finance
yes i do
this is nice
a nice evening
and you planned it
and called me when you said you would
and showed up on time
thank you bill
youre very welcome
another awkward long silence
alex now seems pretty agitated
hes shirtless his hairs a disaster
hes holding his phone handset
staring at it
he cant stop himself
hey its gigi
youve reached my cell
im either having a very good time or in a meeting either way just leave a message and alex hangs up
he stands there for a second thinking
then he runs into his bedroom like a madman
gigi and bill stand awkwardly outside her door
it was nice meeting you
thank you for a lovely evening
bill reaches out for an ill timed hug
she comes inside drops her stuff and sits on the couch
then a knock on the door
gigi reluctantly gets up
did you forget something
she opens the door
its not bill
what did you forget
alex reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pen
the gigi tries without success to suppress a smile
a speakeasy from the s that hasnt changed much
a piano starts to play on a tiny stage empty
and then a terrified but determined anna takes her place in front of the mic
and begins to sing
its a the last goodbye by jeff buckley barely recognizable more of a torch song
as she sings she begins to gain confidence
we hear the song over beth and neils place
neil comes in holding a few messily packed boxes
he is clearly moving back in
how did all this stuff fit in here fine before
beth comes in after him holding some of his clothes
i dont know
neil collapses on the couch
beth sits next to him a pile of clothes on her lap
she looks down and laughs
no you are not trying to bring these back in here beth holds the cargo pants that she protested before
i have no idea what youre we had a deal
these are not staying
thats really gonna free up a lot of space
i have a bag im taking to the goodwill
neil watches her smiling as she walks across the room
just check to make sure theres nothing in the pockets before we give them away
beth dutifully puts her hands in the pockets
and then she feels something
her face registers curiosity as she pulls out a black velvet ring box
beth looks at it and when she looks up neils down on one knee
i love you so much
i want to make you happy
i need to make you happy for me to even have a shot at being happy too
tears stream down beths face
neil pops open the box revealing an engagement ring
will you marry me
neil gets up and kisses her
they kiss passionately for a long moment
and then yes
of course yes
gigi and alex stand in her entry
she holds the pen
you came all the way here at at night to give me back a promotional pen
i thought i better come up with some excuse to get over here
isnt that how its done
alex looks at gigi for a long moment
he looks nervous
look i cant stop thinking about you
i drive by your place
i call and hang up
im turning into me
well a wise person once told me that if a guy wants to be with a girl he will make it happen
no matter what
because when i was hurling my body onto yours you did not seem to want to make it happen
heres the thing about that
you were right
ive gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from these women having the power that i didnt know what it felt like when i actually fell for
one of them
gigi considers this
look ive just been out with your friend bill
and it just might be exactly what i need
he does what he says
i could do that stuff too
but you didnt
and that same wise person told me that i am the rule
that i have to stop thinking that every guy will change stop thinking that i will be the but before she can finish her sentence alex kisses her
that i will be the exception
alex looks at her
you are my exception
they continue to kiss
a staple of summer in baltimore
the rickety baltimore blade float comes by
its a very phallic blade with a a bunch of young shirtless men dancing and waving
mary rides the float too waving to the crowd with nathan joshua and bruce
conor with a nattily dressed gay couple stands on the street watching
nathan calls down from the float
what are you guys doing up there
get your asses up here
with that the two nattily dressed gays grab conor and climb up onto the float
they shout over the music
this is conor
he just sold us on the most amazing duplex in mt
conor looks at mary and smiles
all of the gay men around them start to dance
like really really dance
its so great to finally meet you in person
they look at each other
is there a connection
would you like to dance
id love to
conor takes her hand and the two of them do an old fashioned slow dance on the float
as everyone freaks around them they smile and dance in each others arms
ben walks into the house and looks around no janine
as he heads to the stairs he stops in his tracks
at the bottom of the stairs all of his clothes are stacked neatly folded into piles
he approaches then sees a carton of cigarettes on top of one pile shit
and a note taped onto the carton ben knock yourself ben slumps down devastated
a beautiful sunny day on the harbor
annas song fades out and the sound of gigis voice fades up
girls are taught a lot of stuff growing up
if a guy punches you he likes you
never try to trim your own bangs
out on the sparkling water neils boat
as we get closer we see garlands on the rails on the bough
even closer and we see beth on the arm of her father
he escorts her down a mini aisle
on the bough of the boat is a tiny wedding
about six guests
and neil waiting for beth at the altar
and someday you will meet a wonderful guy and get your very own happy ending
mary sits at her desk typing on her laptop
on the every movie we see every story were told implores us to wait for it
the third act twist
the man who couldnt get it together finally figuring it out
the unexpected declaration of love
mary hits a button and a box comes up which reads are you sure you want to delete this myspace profile
mary clicks yes
myspace profile deleted appears
then a knock on the door
mary gets up grabs her little purse and opens the door
mary smiles her face barely able to contain her happiness
gigi and alex sit close on her couch watching a movie
the exception to the rule
we pan over to the tv to find that they are watching some kind of wonderful
watts and keith finally kiss
gigi cant suppress her smile as alex pulls her close
what were not taught is how to read the signs
ben heads to the checkout line holding a six pack of beer and a bag of chips
as hes about to put his stuff down a pretty girl gets in line behind him
how to tell the ones who want us from the ones who dont
the ones wholl stay from the ones wholl leave
he lets her go ahead of him
she smiles takes him up on it
the cashier rings her up she pays for her stuff without giving ben so much as a look
ben gives his stuff to the cashier along with a weak smile
from the outside looking in a ground floor window we can see the living room of the lower apartment
boxes fill the room clearly a new tenant moving in
janine enters carrying two boxes
she opens one and pulls out the antique mirror now with new glass
and ultimately were not taught the one thing that could save ourselves our friends our families countless hours of confusion despair and speculation
she hangs the mirror straightening it slightly
she steps back seems pleased
then in front of camera walk two people the camera follows them down the sidewalk
we see its anna walking with a new guy its clear its a first date
they stop at the corner exchange an awkward hug
as they turn to go their separate ways it was nice meeting you
anna smiles the new guy turns and heads off
anna watches him go and then turns and walks away from us
that sometimes the happy ending
is just moving on
anna walks down the hill the skyline of baltimore in front of her
