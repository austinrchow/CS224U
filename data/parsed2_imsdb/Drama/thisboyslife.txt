written by based on the book by march draft it is and we are in the deserts of utah
tony bennett sings rags to riches on the soundtrack
breath taking scenery stretches out on either side of a highway
the camera moves to reveal a nash ambassador as it labors up a hill
twelve cars are caught behind the thirty mile per hour pace
two cars decide to ignore safety and cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car
two people are in the straining car a woman and her son
the woman is caroline wolff
somewhere in her s she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works at it
just now though her prettiness is marred by a fading bruise on her right cheekbone
she is bright and energetic and lively
even more important than these qualities though is her humor
and most important of all is a sensual quality she exudes
her sensuality is effortless as natural to her as the color of her eyes and hair
men turn on the street to stare at her
the boy is toby wolff
a pleasant faced boy with won derful eyes he is teetering on the brink of adolescence so that one moment he seems like a self assured teenager and the very
next like a ten year old kid
just now the ten year old kid has the upper hand bored and weary with the long trip toby has been arguing with caroline who is ignoring him
well i mean it
im serious i do
you promise and promise and then you change your mind just like that
totally oblivious uh huh
you wait til you ask me for something
see if you get it
as above toby hush
let me just
so concentrated on her driving she doesnt even finish her sentence she nurses the car upward
finally the car crests the hill and starts down
caroline sighs with relief
she turns to toby with a smile
whatd you say
i said for the twentieth time if a person promises somebody something they cant just turn around and take it back
oh honey jesus
dont start with that again
because im the mother and i get to tell you what to do every minute of your life til youre eighteen
seriously weve got no money
i cant buy you the moccasins
i bet if youd promised roy some moccasins hed of got em
no talk about roy okay
and ditto the moccasins
we cant afford them
yeah but you did promise
take me to court
oh toby i know youre disappointed but
call me jack
youre going to drive me to an early grave im never going to make salt lake city
if a person cant get a stinking miserable pair of moccasins at least he ought to be able to choose his own name
loud and i wanna be called jack
and you can call me
she thinks jeanette
oh youre so stupid sometimes the bawling of an airhorn interrupts him
both of them look through the back window and see a huge tractor trailer truck out of control bearing down on them
caroline brakes and steers a hard right skidding the nash safely onto the side of the road
the truck its horn blasting steadily shimmies and slides past them and then hideously fails to make the next curve it smashes through the guard rails and into empty space
its horn still blaring
caroline and toby look at each other then scramble out of the car
other drivers have stopped to look hundreds of feet below the truck lies on its back among boulders
caroline glances then turns away
she pulls toby away one arm around his shoulder
caroline fills the nashs steaming radiator with a can of water
not much heat goddamn thing
she glances back to where a larger crowd of people stare avidly down at the truck
she bites her lip
oh that poor man
there is a pause
then toby speaks i hope to hell this isnt some kind of omen
caroline turns to toby her face worried
then she sees the look in tobys eyes hes ragging her
she grins and gives his shoulder a light affectionate shove
toby feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand new pair of indian moccasins and caroline sing mood indigo together
toby holds a complicated looking black con traption which looks something like an antique flashlight
hows this thing work anyway
not confident it makes a black light that uh causes uranium traces to glow
and we just walk along the street and find this glowing uranium
well it was everywhere in moab they say just like gold in the gold rush days
but we were too late in moab and that guy at the office said nobodyd found any uranium in salt lake city
well that means well have the place pretty much to ourselves huh
honey this could be a big break for us
if this works out oh just think well get us a house get rid of this damn nash ambassador no money worries
itll be like heaven on a june day
we hear mood indigo on the car radio and see that a weary caroline has driven through the night and toby is slumped against the passenger door
toby stirs then opens his eyes
ask me how far we are from salt lake city
toby is instantly awake excited
caroline points to a small highway sign and both she and toby yell out
forty seven miles to go
both of them are laughing with excitement
toby claps his hands together once very hard and caroline yells well hell
the nash ambassador sits by the side of the road its hood up its radiator steaming
caroline and toby sit in a patch of shade by the car
if i could have one wish right now only one wish you know what id like
id like to burn this damn nash ambassador to a crisp
as toby laughs im serious
i hate it
i hate the factory that produced it and i hate the man who invented it
it almost makes me want to see roy he was the only one could make the thing stop overheating
a beat my god he was boring
boring and mean you sure got crappy taste in boyfriends
at the mention of roys name caroline lightly touches the bruise on her right cheekbone
not enjoying the talk about roy she pours the water into the radiator and speaks directly to the car
id like to burn you to the ground
to toby big smile lets go get rich in salt lake city
toby waits beside the nash ambassador looking toward a three story concrete building
he holds a portable radio which plays dean martin singing volare
caroline holding the imitation geiger counter stands across the counter from a man who is looking at her very strangely
youre pulling my leg right
no i came here to look for uranium
my god lady
if youre looking for uranium why didnt you go to moab
we went there but everybodyd beaten us there
we were too late
so you came here just on the chance youd find uranium
listen you mind me saying something to you might sound rude
lady you got more courage than you got common sense
caroline exits the building dumps the geiger counter in a trash can and strides to the car
she gets in and says two words dont ask
caroline turns the key in the ignition and gets only a maddening rer rer rer rer noise from the engine wearily she rests her forehead on the steering wheel
caroline and toby have the hood up and are peering into the engine
that mechanic in colorado said it needed points
dont tell me what i already know
this things a bottomless pit
i dont know what to do
no matter how much money i pour into it
suddenly a woman in pedal pushers and a thin inexpensive sweater stops
shes vaguely low class but friendly and sympathetic
id rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble
course these days i dont have to worry about that
my husband got laid off at the mill and they repossessed the car so wherever i wanna go i just have to hoof it you know
caroline smiles then her face changes
you dont have a car
as the woman shakes her head you want this one
shocked the woman says i
youre gonna give our car away
to the woman seriously
it needs points and it overheats constantly but you can have it if you want it because my hand to god i cant look at it one more minute
get the bags out
get the owners slip out of the glove compartment
were rid of this son of a bitch pink and white albatross
you dont mind taking a car with a big dent in the passenger door
she looks theres no dent there
caroline draws back her leg and delivers a terrific flat footed kick to the door leaving a dent the size of a dish pan
oh yes there is
toby hands the woman the owners slip caroline gives her the keys
you really just giving me this car
you got yourself a nash ambassador
to toby lets go
both of them pick up two bags apiece all they have in the world and off they go feeling good
is all around us gas is
cents a gallon bread is cents a loaf cars are curved and heavily chromed people occasionally nod and smile at strangers children carry hula hoops
in all a gentler time
caroline and toby stride along briskly as if they knew where they were going
find ourselves a cheap room someplace well get you into school ill brush up on my typing and get a job and thingsll start looking up
i feel it the good times are coming
and at least were rid of that damn nash ambassador
yeah and like dad used to say we may be broke but were never poor
and later if we get a house with a big yard i could get a collie you know
one like lad or grey dawn
and someday maybe a palomino
and im going to try harder in school too
the two of them walk on a bit foolish but in an odd way brave as hell
a subdued toby sits in front of the vice principal
like to give new boys the benefit of the doubt but this is the second time in two weeks that youve been in front of me and i dont like
picks up a telephone now i think you better just call your mother and tell her to come down here
silent the man continues to hold out the telephone to toby
finally he takes it and dials
caroline and toby exit
toby sullen caroline angry
it wasnt me broke their stupid windows
gee thanks a lot mom believe them instead of me
if you care anything about me at all youll shut up
yeah well if youd stayed married to dad none of this wouldve ever happened
look dont you put that on my back i cant make your father call you
i cant make your brother write you
they dumped you
but its not my fault
the place is pretty bleak a room and a half murphy beds linoleum floors and a bath down the hall
caroline and toby enter
she pulls down the murphy bed and falls onto it fully dressed saying my head is killing me
toby heads for his room
caroline wakes up with a start then sees toby sitting in a chair watching her
what time is it
why didnt you wake me
i started dinner
the potatoes are frying and im heating up the hot dogs
caroline sees that hes trying to make it up to her and pats the bed for him to sit down next to her
he moves to sit beside her
hold your mothers hand
i know you are honey
ah well it wasnt fire and nobody bled so i guess were okay
the telephone rings and she answers it
when she hears the voice on the other end she once again touches her right cheekbone with a finger the spot where the bruise had been
she sags back against a wall
listens yes i know
listens youre right
listens all right yes
in an hour then
caroline hangs up
who was that
she closes her eyes
who was that
caroline laughs aloud then slides down the wall until shes on the floor still laughing
weve got a guest for dinner its roy
he tracked us down
toby groans and falls full length onto the sofa
caroline toby and roy are eating at the tiny table
roy is good looking in a meaty hairy chested sort of way
though he is on his very best behavior just now there is a mean streak in him
toby delighted holds a winchester
rifle across his lap a peace making gift from roy
i found me a room but its clear the hell and gone cross town
and i think i got a job lined up doin tune ups in a texaco station
how you like it at winsteads
how do you know where i work
i been here almost a week
you followed me around
for a week
roy doesnt answer
he just wiggles his eyebrows like groucho marx
and how did you ever find me
again roy does the groucho marx
he turns to toby
you like the rifle toby
jack i mean
its the best present i ever got
i just love it
to caroline im going to pretend im shooting
dont point that thing at anybody or i wont teach you to shoot
its not loaded
you heard me anybody or any thing
its got no bullets for gods sake
dont make me speak to you again
ill point it at the sky then
toby opens a screenless window and points the gun up into the night sky pretending to fire it over and over
caroline starts to clear the table
roy jumps up to help her
caroline and roy are kissing on the sofa and he is all over her his hands are on her breasts her thighs everywhere
aroused in spite of herself caroline pulls away indicating the light in the other room
tobys still up
roy leans back smiling and eyes caroline
you are one sweet thing baby just the sight of you makes my dick hard
he pulls her to him starting to kiss her
she fends him off looking worriedly toward the room where tobys light burns
aw he wont hear anything
again he pulls her toward him again she turns her head from the kiss
then it happens
a spasm of anger passes across his face and he shoves caroline away from him
its a hard shove but nothing that could really hurt her
violence has happened before between these two and they recognize it
caroline is immediately on guard and roy is apologetic
shit baby im sorry
i didnt mean that
im just so glad to see you
he slides toward caroline kisses her
this time she accepts the kiss feels she has no choice
dressed for bed toby stands by an open window
he can hear every word of roys who continues to apologize between kisses
the room is illuminated by a nearby streetlamp
the frosty air from the open window causes his breath to steam
he raises two fingers to his lips pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the steam from his breath
the voices in the other room grow a bit louder almost to an argument and then subside again
toby takes another drag from his pretend cig arette
he looks very young
toby wanders toward the rooming house
he stops to watch two fiftyish women who are working in a garden
one woman looks up
the woman stops to take a breather lights a cigarette pokes her companion
my lord look at the eyes on him wont he be a heartbreaker in three four years
you live in the neighborhood sweetie
a beat i wont be here long though cause my dads coming to get me
im gonna live on his ranch in phoenix
the lazy b its called
that sounds like fun
ive got a palomino horse and a collie and dad lets us go on hunts all by ourselves
he gave me this winchester
and last year i shot a mountain lion with it
and lad thats my dog found a nest of rattlesnakes one time and killed all twelve of them
the two women exchange a glance
its obvious the boy is lying
four packed suitcases lie on the bed behind caroline
whatre you doing home so as he sees suitcases we going someplace
we sure are
i dont know
got any suggestions
i was thinking of phoenix or seattle lots of opportunities in both those places
what about your fabulous boyfriends
what about the fabulous boring roy
is he coming too
not if i can help it
i looked out the window at work today and he was parked across the street watching
roys so uncool
you liked him well enough last night
imitating toby oh roy i just love my rifle so much
its the bestest present ever
oh shut up
but hes smiling completely unbothered
suddenly caroline laughs stands up and begins to close the suitcases
toby laughs too
were going now
what about all the food
even the canned stuff
they grab the four heavy suitcases and head out the door
both of them are laughing
caroline and toby stand at a ticket counter disappointed
well ask him when the next one to phoenix is
tomorrow morning eleven forty five
toby and caroline groan then caroline brightens
what about seattle
consults a list leaves in nine minutes
they look at each other
toby and caroline hurry onboard a greyhound bus with seattle as its destination
ive always had a good head for figures and if i could get my c
license i believe we could make a real go of it in seattle
ill advertise for roommates and i bet we find us a real cute house to rent
if theres a big yard can i get a collie
oh honey i feel a wind at my back i think this is going to work out good
as they board bus yeah like heaven on a june day
the doors of the bus close
the bus begins to move
caroline and tobys faces are at the window seattle or bust
the house is a nasty little thing with peeling paint
from inside we hear
and if you cut school again ill just wear you out do you hear me
im tired of it
toby exits the house
but jesus what a new toby hes turned cool
a few months have passed
he now wears t shirts and jeans which ride way low on his hips
as he walks along he combs his hair into a ducks ass in back and forward into a curl at the center of his forehead
hes hip or thinks he is
he strolls on feeling cool
from one of the houses terry taylor emerges falling into step with toby
hes tobys age and is almost an exact replica of him
whatd your mom say about skipping school today
you go over to wandas house last night
as toby nods you make out good
as toby nods again how good
i fucked her til her nose bled
sure you did
oh wolff youre rich
terry silver opens the door to admit toby and terry taylor
silver is a clone of both toby and terry taylor
as the three boys troop through the room they pass terry silvers two sisters who are sprawled sensually on a sofa
oh look its elvis elvis and elvis
excuse me but does your face hurt
cause its killing me
with that piece of high wit theyre out of the room
the boys light up three cigarettes opening a window so the smoke will disappear then throw themselves onto the floor in front of a black and white tv
superman is on
when lois lane comes on terry taylor starts moaning as if sexually aroused terry silver jumps to his knees and licks the tv screen repeatedly also moaning
toby closes his eyes also as if in sexual transport
oh baby come here i got six hot inches just waiting for you
man look at her
look at that body y y y
continues licking screen um m m m
m m m
oh annette i want you
i want you so bad
you make my dick hard
the three carry on for a few more seconds
yum yum yum
making wet kissing noises or just rocking their heads back and forth as if tempted beyond endurance
then slowly they shut up and lie back down
and this is what they really wanted absolutely silent all three boys stare fixedly at the screen
they are totally absorbed caught up in the sweetness and warmth of the show
not one of these boys has ever touched a girls breast all three are at least two years from their first shave all three are pre pubescent and their sexuality
is all bravado now we see them for what they are three skinny armed year olds fascinated by superman
caroline pirouettes for her two roommates kathy a diffident sweet faced young woman and marian a heavyset loud red faced woman who eats compulsively from a package of oatmeal cookies
both of the women ooh and aah over carolines dress
that belt just makes it
it does pick up the green doesnt it
and you say hes getting serious already
yes i think
he keeps talking about marriage keeps saying he wants to meet toby
well thats it three dates and you got im good
i dont know if i want him she stops as toby enters the kitchen
dont want who
about toby little pitchers
well its the tough guy who cant be bothered to go to school
to toby oh its nothing we were talking about dwight
i told you about dwight
he the one drives down from the boondocks
what a stupid name
he draws the name out dwiiiight
dwight tah h h h
there is a knock on the front door
toby sticks his head around the door looking into the living room
a man is outlined against the sunset only his black silhouette is visible
it is our first glimpse of dwight
has the man heard him
toby doesnt know for sure
caroline brings dwight into the kitchen
he is older than her an attractive enough man
he is well built has a full head of brown hair and very white teeth
those are his good points
on the minus side his over eagerness to please his nervous smiles and his clothes
he wears two tone shoes a hand painted tie and a monogrammed handkerchief folded beyond perfection in the pocket
caroline introduces him to marian and kathy
then she introduces dwight to toby
dwight is all smiles
would you like coffee before we go
or a coke
you know i believe i could stand a cup of java
as caroline pours the coffee dwight turns to toby
so youre toby
youre not toby
oh he wants to be called jack
its so silly
ever since he read jack london
well ill call him anything he wants
to toby confidential i always say people can call me anything they want long as they dont call me late for supper
kathy and marian think its pretty funny
toby just stares
so jack you like school
he might like it if he ever went there and tried it
oh have another cookie marian keep your strength up
id like to just yank that nasty tongue of yours out by the roots
to dwight light my sons decided to try to drive me into an early grave
to toby not so light you straighten up and be polite you hear me
dwight takes a swallow of the coffee
his eyes widen
who made this
well well well all i can say is that you people are pretty lucky to live in a house where oh
marian puts a cigarette into her mouth
dwight jumps up pulls a velvet case from his pocket and extracts a mono grammed zippo
he snaps open the top of the lighter against his leg and holds the flame in front of marians face
she lights her cigarette
then dwight perform the zippo drama in reverse
what a conversation stopper
finally kathy speaks to toby
i hear youre invited up to dwights next week for thanksgiving
aw youll love it
great air great water
for scenery all you have to do is step outside your front door and open your eyes
and theres a turkey shoot thanksgiving day
your mom said you might like it so i signed you up
toby sits up eager
i can shoot my winchester
i bet i could be the one to get the turkey
well amazing it can sit up and talk like a normal human being
notices the time dwight were going to be late
she grabs her coat which dwight jumps up to hold for her and they exit
as dwight leaves he kisses his hand then throws the kiss toward marian and kathy
the instant the front door slams what a geek
i love a man knows hes so appealing
how to dress
we hear screaming
toby and terry taylor race by the camera on stolen tricycles yelling as if theyre attack ing indians
behind them comes terry silver on foot
atop a small hill both boys jump off letting the tricycles smash into a parked car
then they run like hell with terry silver bringing up the rear
caroline is dressed casually
toby has on a shirt and sweater
he is pretending that hes buck toothed
caroline finishes packing a small suitcase
i want you to be polite to dwight this weekend
buck toothed speech okay
i mean it now
buck toothed speech i said okay didnt i
hey cmon maybe the weekendll be fun
maybe concrete will be pretty
buck toothed speech oh concrete my favorite town
welcome to beautiful concrete
and stop that
buck toothed speech stop what
sometimes i could kill you as free as i could eat a bite
buck toothed speech ditto
a car stops and through a window we see dwight
caroline turns to toby
please be nice
toby stops the buck toothed thing and speaks normally
we see dwight driving his shiny buick caroline and toby beside him
as the camera tracks the car with various shots we hear air like wine at my place and i dont mind saying i wouldnt live anywhere else and thats the
gods honest truth
theres good schools honest people and some of the best fishing in the world
ted williams you like baseball toby
that is jack i mean you like baseball
cause ted williams whom i believe is one of the all time greats is also a world class angler
manys the day he and ive talked over the best way to get a fish to say yes to a hook
a beat hunting too theres game everywhere you look
i dont think i flatter myself by saying that im something of a whiz with a rifle and concrete gives me every opportunity to prove it
the three stand by the edge of the bridge looking down into the water
they see salmon fighting the last few yards of their yearly battle to spawn
against the rapid current they leap again and again
long strips of flesh hang from their bodies
they always show you salmon fighting to get upstream but they never show you what they look like when they get there
her face strained caroline leans over for a closer look
the salmon swim in slow stunned circles some with an eye missing or hanging by a membrane a hideous sight
theyll spawn and then theyll die
theyre dying now
as toby and caroline move to the passenger side of the car toby speaks so dwight cant hear i hope to hell its not an omen
caroline has to fight back a smile
the buick drives into town past an enormous disused concrete silo where welcome to concrete is painted in huge faded letters
so here we go
welcome to concrete
dwights home sweet home
finest people in the whole state of washington you ask me
lots of churches too
a neighbor of mine says looking for nice churches come to concrete
looking for sin go to hell
i think thats funny
caroline and toby are severely underimpressed with their first impression of concrete
dwights buick pulls to a stop dwight caroline and toby get out
the scenery is as beautiful as dwight said it was
all the houses are converted army barracks made into duplexes three children exit the house
skipper a pleasant boy who is average in every way is
norma is slow spoken and sensual toby cannot take his eyes off her
the third is pearl two years younger than toby
pearl has a bald spot the size of a dollar high on the side of her head
lets see here
kids this is my pretty friend caroline wolff and her boy to
he catches himself jack wolff
these are my kids skipper norma and my baby pearl
everybody says hello shakes hands then they all head into the house
they enter and look around well its not awful but it sure as hell isnt wonderful
the room is dark on the small side and shows the lack of a womans hand
caroline looks a bit taken aback but tries to hide it by saying the word nice over and over
the camera follows them from room to room okay so that was the living room over here is the kitchen i plan on getting all new fixtures in here and
down that hall are the three bedrooms and the bath
he stops at an extra no particular purpose nondescript room furnished only by two easy chairs and a card table
this is sort of a lounging area
as nobody says anything you know just in case you want to
he searches cant think of how to finish the sentence in any impressive way
he gives up finishes weakly lounge
skipper snorts with laughter but cuts it off when dwight gives him a look
toby trying to be good bites his lip to keep from laughing
the business area is small and rather forlorn
the six of them walk in pairs dwight and caroline skipper and norma and last toby and pearl
tobys eyes are glued to the movement of normas body
about a gas station and over theres where i work
to skipper and norma how about you guys
you like it here
they glance at each other
yeah its fine
its a little isolated is all
not that isolated
well maybe not that isolated
pretty isolated though
aw theres plenty to do in concrete if you kids would take a little initiative
when i was growing up we didnt have t
we used our imaginations
we read the classics
we played musical instruments
you show me a bored kid ill show you a lazy kid
i didnt know you played an instrument dwight
what do you play
one half seconds hesitation sax
skipper and norma glance at each other then look away
caroline takes a cigarette from her purse
again dwight jumps to her service we are once more treated to the mini drama of dwight unsheathing the zippo from its velvet case opening the top on his pants
back to skipper and norma hows the school here
there isnt one
we go to chinook
its a few miles downriver
come off it its not that far
yeah i clocked it thirty nine miles
in spite of the fact that hes eager for this day to go well dwights bottom teeth begin to show
ah youd bellyache if the goddam school was in your fugging back yard
just shut your god damn pie hole
they all shut their pie holes
the six walk in a tense uncomfortable silence for five full beats
then pearl tries to help out im in fifth grade
nobody seems to care
dwight has recovered his good mood
dressed in a marksmans coat with a padded shoulder dwight is laughing as he attempts to assemble tobys winchester
turkey shoot is just a figure of speech
theres no real turkey
no its just regulation paper targets
its a test of skill
a beat and jack i just found out yesterday that they wont let kids shoot
but you said i could
i know but they got it all screwed up somehow and told me wrong at first
toby starts to argue but caroline touches his arm
dwight you did tell him
an edge i dont make the rules caroline
if i made the rules i might make different ones but i dont make the rules
a sullen toby stands with pearl
dwight is giving his name and the entry fee to a man
as the man moves away caroline stops him and holds out some money
you mean you want to enter
i think its against the rules
well that sign says this is an n
club and im a dues paying n
that gives me the right to participate in the activities of other chapters
youll be the only woman shooting
caroline just smiles
the man shrugs takes her money and writes down her name
the shooting match has begun
the contestants have ten turns to fire ten shots apiece at a large paper bulls eye fifty yards away
the scores and rankings are on a portable scoreboard
a contestant finishes shooting
there is a pause
everyone watches as his score is raised from behind the concrete wall on which the bulls eye hangs
the score comes
there is a smattering of applause and its dwights turn
from his stance dwight looks as if he is a pretty good shot
hes nervous though because caroline is going to shoot and he squeezes off his ten shots in rapid succession hardly pausing to breathe
a pause and then his score is raised
dwight smiles an inappropriate smile and hands the winchester to caroline
there are a couple of whistles as caroline takes her position and someone in the crowd yells out oh mama shake that thang
caroline ignores it taking her shooting stance which is surprisingly graceful and professional looking
she shoots her ten bullets taking time to breathe once deeply between each shot
the pause and her score is raised
there is a moment of surprised silence and then the crowd gives caroline a sincere round of applause
dwight looks stunned and toby is almost equally surprised
on the scoreboard we see that caroline is in second place and by only two shots
as the next to last round finishes caroline is surrounded by a few people who are complimenting her shooting
dwights smile is even bigger oh he wanted to be the one to win
the last round starts
a man evidently the one in first place heads to the shooting alley for his turn
as he passes caroline trying to rattle her he speaks confidently
that second place trophy aint bad honey
big smile then you wont feel too bad about carrying it home will you
several people laugh and the man bested turns away
everyone turns quiet to watch the man shoot
he is evidently the one whos nervous though for after he shoots and waits the score is raised
there is an immediate stir caroline can win if she shoots a virtually perfect round
dwights name is called
he takes his position but clowns around shooting first left handed then right handed then with both eyes closed
his score is raised
there is scattered laughter and dwight leads it hell its all a joke to him his attitude says
caroline takes her stance
rock steady she shoots her ten shots and waits
and then it comes
the second place man wheels away angrily but everyone else congratulates the laughing caroline as an official presents her with a small trophy of a gold rifle on a pedestal
and a huge ham
in the midst of the hubbub toby manages to get close enough to congratulate his mother
caroline glances toward dwight as she whispers to toby that was for you honey
impressed i didnt know you were a member of the n
im a little behind in my dues thirty six years behind
caroline toby and pearl enter
norma is cooking thanksgiving dinner
dwight walks heavily down the hall to his bedroom and slams the door
mom won the turkey shoot
now were in for it he thinks hes some kind of big hunter
well he killed a deer once
that was with the car
they all laugh
though there are some occasional sentences like could i have the potatoes please
or this dressing is really delicious mostly there is just silence and the noise of silverware on plates
dwight is working hard on the wine
i got just one thing to say
as everyone stiffens im sitting at the table with the best damn shot in the county
everybody relaxes and general conversation begins
norma plays blue monday on an upright piano whilst toby sings it
after finishing the song norma launches into on moonlight bay
everybody joins in
toby and caroline glance at each other and smile
caroline who is sleeping on the sofa bed returns from the bathroom
she sees that tobys awake on his pallet on the floor
she sits on the floor beside him
the whole conversation is conducted in whispers
so what do you think
whats that bald spot on pearls head
some sort of infection
theyre all nice but dwight keeps rushing me keeps talking about marriage
and i dont really want to get married not now anyway
thats fine with me
a beat new tone i wish you wouldve stayed married to dad
oh dont wish duke back on me
that woman he married
is she really rich
like king midas
okay look well go back to seattle and see how things go
ive been thinking about taking a course in stenotyping
a court reporters pay is real high
kathy got engaged so either i find us another roommate or ive got to make some more money
and this stenotyping thing sounds just right
this could turn out good honey
toby terry silver and terry taylor lounge against the wall smoking
i mean i blew it off man i blew his fuckin turkeys head off
terry silver takes a long slow drag on his cigarette
the other boys glance at each other they dont buy it
wolff you are so full of shit
dont believe me see if i care
bullet would do is make a hole in his head
toby takes a drag on his cigarette
one bullet maybe
oh i see you hit the turkey more than once
while he was flying
in the head
silver and taylor howl with laughter
furious toby says fuck you over and over
he pulls out a rat tail and scratches the words fuck you onto the soft paint of the bathroom wall
toby stands at the top of a small hill with terry silver and terry taylor
they are too casual their faces too innocent somethings up
they wait until a middle aged man raking leaves turns and disappears around a corner
then the three of them open the door of a car take off the emergency brake and start it rolling down the hill
the car rolls silently down the hill
it crashes into another car at the bottom making a loud noise
the three boys run like the wind out of sight
caroline toby marian and kathy sit at the table eating dinner
exactly what i wanted for my dress
its a simplicity pattern and im pretty sure i can make it myself
its got big puff sleeves
caroline takes out a cigarette
then everybody jumps as toby yells and jumps up knocking his chair over backwards
toby grabs carolines lighter and begins to imitate dwight saying oh
and oh yes
and oh my
and here let me
and ill do that
its a mean accurate imitation of dwight
all three women laugh in spite of themselves
caroline keeps saying jack thats enough and marian says dwights not that bad
but they cant help laughing
toby offers the other two women a light then offers a broom the back door and the refrigerator a light
the principal mr
shippy sits behind his desk
toby looking scared sits across from him
a secretary lets caroline into the room
shippy rises and introduces himself
caroline doesnt respond to the introduction
what did he do
he violated the school property and flouted the law
can you say that in english
he wrote obscene words on the wall
to toby did you do it
as he shakes his head no he didnt do it
strong he wrote obscene words on the wall
what obscene words
after a beat fuck you
thats one obscene word
shippy looks stymied
there is a pause
wolff jacks teachers like him but they think hes fallen in with the wrong kind of friends
peers at tobys hand is that nicotine stain on your fingers
as toby shakes his head no i hope not
let me tell you a story i started smoking in college
two packs a day
i ate em
a beat one night i went to have a cigarette and lo and behold the pack was empty
i went downstairs and started to rummage through the garbage cans
but as i reached down i mean right down into a garbage can i suddenly thought whoa
hold on right there buster
i went back to my room and to this day i havent smoked another cigarette
a beat after that every day i saved the exact amount of money i wouldve spent on cigarettes
in three years i put it all together and you know what i bought
i bought myself
a dramatic pause big finish a nash ambassador
caroline gives a bark of laughter
she brings out a handkerchief and coughs as if she has a cold
shippy looks puzzled
well back to the point i think two weeks suspension
caroline and toby enter the house
caroline goes into the bedroom shuts the door
toby sits on the couch
late afternoon sun slants through the venetian blinds
toby sits exactly as he sat before
then caroline comes out of the bedroom ominously calm
she sits down
so what shall we do
what do you mean
ever since duke and i got divorced youre a different boy
i know he never calls you and i could kill him for it but thats how duke is
and gregorys in princeton now so i guess
refocusing so what shall we do
because this isnt working
a beat we barely have enough money kathys moving out and on top of it all youve gone wild
no i don
yes you do
you steal from marians purse i just cant handle you anymore and it scares me
i dont know what to do
so you tell me what to do
he means it i can be better
i will be
it bursts out of him and i hate the way i am anymore
i dont know why i do it
a beat what about that stenotyping thing you were gonna do
with peculiar intensity caroline speaks in a soft odd voice it wont happen
it wont happen
it wont happen
things arent going to turn out well things arent going to start looking up and its never going to be like heaven on a june day
there is no uranium
there is no stenotyping
there is no c
she stands for a few moments as if listening for a far off sound
i talked to dwight after christmas he wants you to come up to concrete and live with him for a few months go to school there
what are you going to do just give me away to him
if you two can get along if it works out then i guess he and i might get married
the two stare at each other
i cant think of anything else to do
but first i want your approval
again the two stare at each other
caroline nods turns away
christmas is over a few scattered pieces of wrapping paper lie scattered on the floor and a small christmas tree with bubble lights glows in a corner
caroline shuts a suitcase and looks at toby
i put in both your sweaters
you wear them now the nights are so chilly up there
you dont have to go if you dont want to honey
no its okay
we hear a knocking and dwights cheery voice
here i am you lucky people
dwights hustles the bags into the trunk tells toby to kiss his mother and hops into the car all smiles all cheeriness
the buick pulls away leaving caroline white faced and miserable
dwight takes a pull from a pint bottle of whiskey and gives toby a sneering contemptuous look
toby reaches over snaps on the radio
immediately dwight snaps it off
then in the headlights glare toby sees a dark shape
hey look is that a raccoon or a beaver
dwight swerves deliberately to hit the animal
there is a sickening thump and dwight stops
as he backs up go get it the pelts worth fifty bucks minimum
that things probably got rabies
low get it
toby moves to where the dead beaver lies on its back its eyes open in the red glow of the taillights
toby picks the thing up and lugs it back toward dwight who has the trunk open
dwight is still drinking between swallows he gives toby sneering glances
dwight is driving very fast
the road begins a series of curves
dwight doesnt slow down and the tires begin to scream on the curves
the road runs along a steep gorge
dwight increases the speed and the car begins to fishtail
im a little sick to my stomach
sick to your stomach
a hotshot like you
im not a hotshot
thats what i hear
i hear youre a real hotshot
come and go where you please do what you please
isnt that right
yeah regular man about town
that right jack
you a performer
thats a goddamned lie
dwight keeps glancing from the road to toby and back again
if theres one thing i cant stomach its a liar
im not a liar
sure you are
you or marian
is marian a liar
she says youre quite the little performer
is that a lie
you tell me thats a lie and well drive back to seattle so you can call her a liar to her face
you want me to do that
then you must be the ones a liar right
as toby nods and youre a performer
lets see your act
do your act
when toby is silent im waiting
sure you can
i hear you do me
again toby shakes his head and then gasps as the car skids hideously close to the cliffs edge
dwight is oblivious to the danger
yeah i hear youre good at doing me
do me with the lighter
dwight holds out the velvet covered zippo driving with one hand and the car is all over the road
dwight puts the lighter back into his pocket
the car slows a bit
you pull that hotshot stuff around me and ill break every bone in your body
you understand me
a beat youre in for a change mister
you got that
you got that good
so scary youre in for a whole nother ballgame
dwights buick pulls to a stop as norma skipper and pearl come out to meet them
dwight is calmer now
skipper go get that washtub out back and pearl bring the hose around and fill it up
hotshot and me hit a beaver
well salt him down
skipper and pearl move out on the run
dwight slits the beaver from throat to testicles guts it then pulls the skin off
i know you think youre better than me
caroline told me all about your rich daddy and your prep school brother but your fancy days are over youre a concrete boy now
im gonna give you a big injection of concrete
thats right inoculate you
oh my yes
youre gonna find out that in concrete we have to be able to do more than sing fats domino songs we work
skipper and pearl bring the tub with four blue stars painted on its side dwight plops the skinned beaver into the water
the hairless carcass stands in the tub its chin on the edge
pearl shudders and turns away
dwight toby norma skipper and pearl are eating dinner at the kitchen table
norma speaks to toby
youll be in miss grahams class
yeah is she nice
i hate changing schools
speaking of changing i had a talk with jack on the way up here and he says he wants to be a better boy
and thats good cause things werent going well for him in seattle the police actually came to his house to talk to caroline about him
uh huh the police
very low to toby criminal
so heres what i think i think idle hands are the devils workshop and so i found our jack a little something to do
to toby i picked up two barrels of horse chestnuts in the park
you can spend your evenings hulling em
and i enrolled you in the boy scouts and youve got a paper route starting monday every afternoon from three to six thirty pays fifty five bucks a month
what dyou say
toby glances around the table he is subdued
ill do it
means it i want to be
thats what i like to hear
okay you guys get these dishes cleaned up
lets show jack how we do it in concrete
miss graham stands in front of the class
toby is midway back in the room
reading of course i prayed and did god care
he cared as much as on the air a bird had stamped her foot and cried give me
what is the tone of this short poem
is it religious
no even though it talks about god i wouldnt say it was religious
well closer maybe
there is a pause
finally toby raises his hand
its angry sort of bitter
very good jack
from the front of the room a tall thin effeminate boy arthur gayle turns to look at toby and holds the gaze for three full beats then turns around and
faces the front
what the hell does it mean
the room is dark
skipper is asleep
toby lies in a cot
dwight leans against the wall near the head of tobys bed
he speaks in a low reasonable voice cause i dont believe that crap you know
i believe there is such a thing as a bad boy bad clear through
and its gonna be my job to turn you around to kill or cure
and im up to the job oh yes believe me hotshot i am ready willing and able to take you on you and that jibagoo music you like to sing
im just the guy to knock that music out of your head and put in some respect and obedience
a pause now your mother has just about washed her hands of you thats obvious cause shes shipped you off up here
i mean she has had it with you
she told me she said dwight i just cant handle him anymore
so dont go crying to mama cause mama wont listen
mama is sick to death of her baby boy
a beat and your rich daddy warbucks and your princeton brother dont give a shit about you cause caroline told me they havent even written in over two years
so it looks like im all you got now its just you and me
feels sort of inevitable doesnt it hotshot
its like we were fated for each other like im the one guy on earth could set you straight
and dont you ever think i wont enjoy doing it cause
a afternoon toby delivers papers in a sack filled with papers slung over one shoulder which thuds against his hip with every step making him tilt to one side against
b night toby sits in a utility porch
the floor around him is two feet deep in horse chestnuts
with a knife and a pair of pliers he husks the chestnuts
his hands are covered with scrapes and cuts and the chestnut hulls bleed a juice that has dyed them a bright yellow
dear toby i sure do miss you honey the house is like a tomb since you left
my only entertainment tonight was watching marian eat a whole pint of ice cream
i hope youre liking it up in concrete
i just know youll try hard in school and be good and mind dwight
i worry about you so much and i hope this will be just what you need
c day toby rubs futilely at his yellow hands with a cloth and watches norma who is drying her hair in her bedroom
she bends over so her head is in a patch of sunlight
toby is riveted by the girl and her hair gleaming in the sunlight
d afternoon again see toby delivering his papers
he sees arthur gayle coming toward him in the street
his hips sway as he walks and his head tilts to one side
as he and toby pass one another he raises one arm and points at toby
the he walks on
dear mom thanks for the birthday present
it fit fine
you dont have to worry so much
im okay here
the weather is nice and i like scouts a lot
dwight took us all to see bridge on the river kwai
i liked it
so things are all right with me except for stupid pearl who i hate
dont worry all the time
e night dwight introduces toby at a scout meeting
all the other boys have on scout uniforms
f day toby is on the utility porch husking the horse chestnuts
his hands are now orange
pearl stands in the doorway watching him work
norma appears beside pearl
normas face turns sympathetic
you remind me of that boy in the fairy tale who had to spend twenty years sifting sand to find a golden needle
remember that one
toby doesnt answer
the two girls move away
toby sighs and picks up another chestnut
g day toby keeping an eye on the door to make sure hes unobserved reaches under the mattress of skippers bed and pulls out several billfold sized black and white
the hair styles of the women in them are decades old
toby takes the photographs into the bathroom shutting the door behind him
dear toby just a note before going to bed
dwight tells me that the two of you are getting along like a house afire
im so glad
i wanted this to work out for you
you left your sock cap here
do you need it
h night skipper is asleep in his bed
across the room toby lies with his portable radio against his head
we hear very very softly rosemary clooney crooning hey there
toby and pearl are playing a card game called slap jack
toby slaps a card down hard yelling i win again
and pearl pouts
thats no fair
you make me sick
i dont know why you have to live here anyway
daddy says we should think of it like you were a charity kid
toby takes out his comb combs his hair a bit then holds it out to pearl an exaggerated look of innocence on his face
wanna comb your hair pearl
pearl covers her bald spot with one hand
probably you do since youve got such pretty hair
i know if i had hair as pretty as yours pearl id comb it all the time
pearl is on the verge of tears
there are three tremen dously loud flat footed kicks against the front door
open the hell up
i got us a treat
pearl opens the door revealing a beaming dwight holding two dishpans piled high with snow
we see through the doorway that the sun is shining and there isnt snow anywhere
were gonna have snowcream
dwight toby skipper norma and pearl are enjoying the snowcream
heard there was a fresh snow this morning so i drove up to the mountains
i stopped in a field where it was all clean
i was finished packing it up high when somebody said
prissy voice thiss private property in case youre interested
normal voice i turned around and there was this woman
he shudders yechh
ugliest woman i ever saw ugly as a madmans ass she was
and frowning on top of it
to pearl soft happy youre ugly as a madmans ass
no you are
whatd you say to the ugly woman
i didnt say nothin i ran
everybody laughs again
they eat in silence for a beat
im gonna get you a scout uniform jack
surprised pleased really
can i join the girl scouts
im getting one for me too
dont believe in doing anything halfway
if youre serious about the scouts
as toby nods then i want you to do it right
well do it right together
dwight takes out a magazine entitled boys life
he hands it to toby
i got you a subscription to this
ill take the price out of your paper route money
its the official scout magazine
tells about what it means to be a scout what kind of boy you need to be and oh about merit badges and stuff like that
toby opens the book at random reads from it
suggested good turns a scout can do assist a foreign boy with some english grammar
help put out a burning field
give water to a crippled dog
i could do those
hell yes you could
youre a bright kid
i want this scout thing done right okay
toby nods enthusiastic happy
toby stands in front of a full length mirror wearing a huge scout uniform thats been unsuccessfully cut down for him
the shirt sleeves have been shortened but the shoulders extend two inches beyond the ends of his shoulders
the pants legs have been cut off and hemmed but the crotch of the trousers hangs down three inches too low giving him a stumpy dwarfish look
toby yells to someone o
im not going
the hell you say
cut down skippers old stuff and hes twice as big as me im gonna stay home
youre gonna shit and fall back in it thats all youre gonna do
now get out here
as pearl watches dwight also stands in front of a mirror adjusting his hat
he is resplendent in a brand new scout uniform
toby stalks into the room
pearl laughs loudly
to pearl shut your pie hole
to toby you look fine
i look like an idiot
you act like an idiot you look fine
you said youd get me a new uniform
i said id try to get you a new uniform
beside this one is new new to you
but look at the sleeves and how it hangs down between my legs
oh piss and moan all you can do is piss and moan
yeah piss and moan i notice youre all jazzed up in new stuff
they didnt have second hand uniforms in my size
oh yeah pull the other leg its got bells on it
toby throws himself down on the sofa
and whatre you gonna tell caroline this weekend
you gonna say you wouldnt join the scouts because
him didnt wike his widdle uniform
dwight picks up the copy of boys life and thumbs through it he reads no boy given over to dissipation or negativity can stand the gaff
he quickly tires and gives up
he is the type who usually lacks courage at the crucial moment
he cannot take punishment and come back smiling
dwight looks at toby expectantly
toby hesitates then gives up
all right but this stinks
toby walks outside
hotshot you dont know it yet but me and concrete are in your blood
were going to make a man of you yet and in years to come youll thank me
youll remember me
me and concrete
dwights buick pulls up and caroline bursts out the front door
she runs to the car and hugs toby
oh i missed you
you look good
how are you
dwight comes around the car kisses caroline and the three head into the house
i said to hell with the budget and bought a roast
i made dumplings god whats wrong with your hands
its just juice from some chestnuts itll wear off
i hope so
my your hairs short
dwight caroline and marian are having a drink
toby plays fats dominos blue monday on the radio the to dwight well its done him a world of good to be up there with you
oh we have us some pretty good times
dont we jack
have us some good times
toby not looking away from the radio nods
we go to the scouts together every week
hes got a good start already on merit badges
to toby though he does concentrate too much on the easy ones like the one for dental hygiene
to caroline and we had snowcream one night and oh just lots of stuff
caroline glances at toby then at dwight then back again
toby and caroline walk slowly idly down the rail tracks
toby avoids her eyes
how is it in concrete
my grades are okay
you havent been in any trouble
as he shakes his head good
howre you and dwight
he made us all snowcream like he said
stop that honey
stops walking well youve got your eyes out of focus
look at me
now are things all right
you act odd
no im fine
id feel awful if it hadnt worked out
i told dwight id marry him
in two weeks
i dont know what else to do
i mean hes been helping me with the rent since kathy left
and you need a father
i think its the best thing all the way around what dyou think
there is a pause as they look at each other
i think its the best thing
i think its the best thing too
caroline smiles smooths his hair then goes into the house
toby continues to walk
suddenly he spins around and tears out toward the house
by god hell tell her just whats been going on
he bangs through the front door and up the stairs
toby stops dead as he sees dwight and caroline locked in a busy kiss
he stops dead and shrinks back into the hallway defeated
toby is alone in the room in his boy scout shirt and hat in front of a mirror
a copy of boys life magazine is open in front of him with drawings of indians performing sign language
watching himself in the mirror toby makes a sign
he makes another sign
he makes another sign
he makes another sign
he makes another sign
he stares silently at himself in the mirror
tarpaulins are everywhere
toby stands surrounded by seven five gallon cans of paint
carrying paintbrushes dwight enters dressed in old clothes singing in the still of the night
now thats a song
not all this elvis presley shit
elvis sings about like i do brain surgery
he imitates elvis moves his hips slightly and sings a few notes
uh huh huh my blue suede shoes
dwight gives toby a flash of his teeth and toby smiles back
lets get this place ready for caroline
they begin painting
after only a few strokes though toby looks doubtful
its so white
i got a good deal on this paint
stands back appraises itll darken up when it dries
the walls and ceiling are almost finished but the paint has not darkened
as he paints he absentmindedly sings blue suede shoes
then he stops painting as he notices toby looking at the walls
i like it
it looks clean
yeah but it makes everything else look so dark
dwights face changes
he has an idea
on the soundtrack elvis blasts out blue suede shoes
dwight and toby paint the coffee table and lamp base white
dwight and toby working faster are painting the end tables white
the walls and ceiling are white dwight and toby are painting the dining table white
dwight and toby are painting the cabinets and kitchen table white
everywhere we look is white the walls ceiling furniture all of it
only the old baldwin upright piano has escaped painting
dwight eyes it suspiciously
sort of stands out doesnt it
yeah you could say that
they paint the baldwin white
dwight hesitates then starts to paint the foot pedals
dwights face tells us that something still doesnt suit him
he glances at toby toby nods and they converge on the piano
very carefully dwight and toby finish painting the dark ivory keys to match the rest of the room
elvis screams out the last line you can do anything but stay off of my blue suede shoes
they stand up look around arctic white is every where
dwight likes it
toby is less sure
the montage ends
skipper and norma are carrying carolines suitcases into the house from dwights buick
from inside the house we hear a womans laughter
caroline is trying to stifle her laughter as she stares at the wilderness of white
dwight and toby skipper norma and pearl all stand watch
oh im so sorry
dont know whats the matter with me
it does look clean
but she cant stop laughing
her laughter has just a tinge of hysteria
dwight and caroline are being married
caroline wears a pale blue suit and dwight looks good in a navy single breasted
aside from toby and dwights children the only guests are marian kathy and three people we havent seen before friends of dwights
the bed is a rats nest of twisted sheets as dwight and caroline make love
he takes his lips away from carolines breast and moves so that his head is at the bottom of the bed
holding her foot up he kisses the instep then runs his tongue over the same spot and then down under the arch of her foot
a sexy scene
m m m
theres not a straight line on you everythings curved
caroline draws him up to her and they kiss
then dwight turns caroline on her side away from him pre paring to enter her
caroline makes a small sound of protest turning back toward him
oh dwight not like that
not this time not tonight
its good this way
but i want to see your face while we make love
uncomfortable laugh oh no i just dont
like that way
dwight continues to stroke caroline his hands everywhere but now she is unresponsive
you mean you dont like to make love face to face
same laugh no i dont like it
i cant handle it i dont like to see the face
you mean ever
dwight murmurs an assent
caroline is appalled
but thats grotesque
stung flares up look you can get it doggie style or you can get it laying on your side those are your only choices
this is my house and i get to say
wherever mcginty sits is the head of the table you know
disgusted caroline turns back away from dwight
he shifts down on the bed a few inches again preparing to enter her
toby is eating toast at the kitchen table
norma has made a big breakfast and she hurriedly pours the coffee when she hears dwight and carolines bedroom door open
happy wedding breakfast
carolines eyes are red and swollen
dwight turns on a radio sips his coffee and chats with norma
toby gives normas rear end an appreciative glance then comes up behind caroline speaking sotto voce so hows the bride
the bride doesnt want to chat
well the bride is sure snotty this morning
smiling toby waits for some response to his teasing but there is none
she turns away and sits at the table
toby his news bag slung over his shoulder stands talking idly with two boys from school oscar booker and jimmy voorhees
one of them says uh oh and jerks his head to indicate where toby and the other boy should look
they look in the direction indicated and see arthur gayle coming down the road toward them followed by a small black dog called pepper
as the boys watch arthurs approach whats his name again
what a homo
he sure walks like a girl
and runs like one and talks like one and throws like one
probably takes a pee like one too just squats right down
he smarted off to me the other day told me i was a bourgeois
what the frigs a bourgeois
to toby call him a sissy
just see what he says
yeah do it
by this time arthur is next to them
smiling a superior smile he stops and glances at all three of them as if they were just the oddest things hes ever seen
then his eye falls on tobys yellow hands
oh my my look at all that yellow didnt your mama teach you to wash your hands after you pee
oh shut up
rolls his eyes heavily sarcastic now thats what i like an insult with some originality
did you just make that up
why dont you take a long walk off a short pier
though hes not nearly close enough to smell tobys breath excuse me but has anyone ever told you your breath would gag a maggot
both of tobys friends laugh
well at least im not a great big sissy
two things happen instantly the superior smile vanishes from arthurs face and tobys friends exchange a single expectant look here it comes
without warning arthur swings a fist at toby catching him on the ear
arthurs second blow hits him in the back of the head
the fight is on
arthur throws punches sidearm with lots of wrist action but there are so many of them
before toby can react arthur has hit him four times including one wild haymaker that puts toby on his knees
while tobys still on his knees arthur tries to kick him in the stomach
the kick is deadened by the papers in tobys bag arthur bends over toby screaming as if he has lost his mind toby gets up and again arthur sails in
with those wild roundhouse swings
then toby gets in a solid punch to arthurs face that rocks the bigger boy back on his heels
arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded buffalo
almost immediately arthurs eye puffs and begins to swell shut
snot streaming from both nostrils still roaring arthur flies at toby again
toby closes with him to hold those flailing arms still and the two stagger around the street like drunken dancers
they separate exchange a few blows then grapple with each other again
then arthur hooks tobys leg trips him and the two roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment
they hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting flailing kicking first toby is on top then arthur then toby then arthur
by now they are panting each breath is a heave a gasp
then suddenly arthur gives out completely he falls on top of toby pressing him deeper into the mud
with his last bit of strength toby throws the bigger boy off him and sits up while pepper barks furiously at him and threatens to nip his leg
toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully
he looks relieved at least its over
no its not
from behind him he hears three words
take it back
toby turns to see a bloody faced swollen eyed arthur clambering up the hill after him like some monster that wont die
both boys reach the top and stand facing one another
take it back
arthurs words are not angry anymore
tobys worn out too
i take it back
no say youre not a sissy
toby glances at oscar and jimmy
their faces are gleeful but he doesnt care what the hell they think
youre not a sissy
arthur immediately turns and walks away but toby ignores them and walks away in the opposite direction delivering his hated newspapers
caroline is painting the white walls a soothing buff color
on the sofa lie half finished curtains shes making
she is totally focused
she hears toby turns sees his filthy clothes
her shoulders sag
i wont do it you know
i wont be a referee between the two of you
who asked you
you both do
just by coming home like this you ask me to take your side when he raises hell
well the answers no
im going to make this marriage work
oh the bride is calm
who the hell cares
caroline refuses to argue
she picks up a piece of material and holds it up to the window to see if her choice of color was a good one
to herself seems like this place is so ugly
seems like everywhere i look theres something
a worried toby sits dreading dwights arrival
behind him on the wall toby has pinned the covers of fifteen copies of the scout magazine so that above tobys head are the words boys life fifteen times
there is a murmur of voices and footsteps coming toward toby
toby expects the worst
but surprisingly dwight is beaming
surprised uh well uh
hes the one cant see out of one eye
you actually gave little lord gayle a black eye
well it wasnt black yet
but it was all puffed up
as toby nods then it was a shiner
dwight sits down next to toby eager for details
howd it start
i called him a sissy
dwight hoots with laughter and slaps his leg
well he sures hell cant sue you for slander
that boy fights for the pink team
did you make him cry
he was just ready to
i called him a big assed squat to pee sissy
as dwight slaps his leg again id have won bigger except he hit me when i wasnt looking
suddenly serious he dry gulched you
now thats your fault
you gotta keep your guard up
theres no excuse for getting dry gulched
ill show you a couple moves after supper thatll leave miss arthur gayle wondering what month it is
still excited dwight is holding forth for the whole family
we hear thunder of an approaching storm so he says you and who elses army
just the three of us i say
me myself and i
a beat well after school hes waiting for me and he yells something i tell you with people like that you got to hurt em gotta inflict pain or theyll
never leave you alone
a beat so it was real hot out okay
and there were these horse turds laying all over the place
i picked one up and went up to him but not acting tough okay
acting more like oh gee im so scared please dont hurt me
sort of like this dwight slumps his shoulders drops his chin and looks up through his eyebrows a simpering expression on his face
so i say excuse me but whats the problem
and he starts in on me again blah blah blah and i jam a horse turd right into that big mouth
then i give him a sucker punch in the breadbasket and he goes down like a
dwight goes on relishing the story
a steady downpour falls outside the porch
dwight and toby both stripped to the waist are boxing
dwight is totally serious about this absolutely sincere
the sweat streaming off the two dwight patiently corrects tobys movements or catches the boys fist to suggest better form
their feet shuffle squeak on the floor
from the shoulder
demonstrates like this
otherwise you leave yourself wide open
as toby tries yeah better better
and keep those feet moving shuffle shuffle thats right
now try for my face
caroline is on the telephone her voice low
behind her through a doorway we can see dwight and toby boxing
not good to tell you the truth not good at all
listens no hes not mean to me
listens again no hes good about that comes home right after work every night
listens again oh marian i dont know maybe i just got my hopes too high although i dont think so
all i want is a little
searches a little son of a bitching sweetness
listens laughs you think so huh
you always did have an eye for dwight didnt you
leans back watches dwight and toby the thing is hes out on the porch teaching jack to box right now
i keep thinking if i can hang on thingsll settle down
if i can just hang on long enough itll work out and my kidll have a father
both dwight and toby sweating heavily
they lean against a wall resting
you said youd show me how to dry gulch somebody
now you can always kick somebody in the balls but i like this one better what you do is hit em in the throat with the side of your forearm
you wait til hah
without warning dwight lunges at toby and swings the side of his arm toward tobys throat
toby dodges wildly falling backward over a box of sports equipment
now thats dry gulching
hit em in the throat but do it before theyre expecting it
now you try
im afraid ill hurt you
but i might
finally toby gives a half hearted hah
and swings the side of his forearm toward dwights throat
dwight catches the arm easily
youre not trying
again toby hesitates again he says hah
and gives a lukewarm swing at dwights throat
well dont go all shy and delicate on me youre as sissy as little miss arthur gayle
yeah ill just call you little miss jackie wolff
ooh my yes hello jackie
tobys eyes flare up then he lowers his head biting his lip sniffling a bit
aw jesus christ if youre gonna without warning toby lunges at dwight screaming hah
trying for the mans throat
caught off guard dwight stops the main force of tobys arm but is slammed onto the ground stunned
you just about got dry gulched my man
dwight manages a grin but he is not happy to have been bested
dwight and caroline lie on the bed kissing passionately
it is clear that caroline is as excited as dwight
i know you may think this is silly dwight but it seems like
i dont know like an emblem or something
i want to be able to see your face when we make love
how else can we be cl the rest of the word is jerked out of her as dwight turns her onto her side away from him and proceeds to make
love again in his favorite manner
you just dont know whats good sugar
youre too tense
you just relax and dwightll take you on a little trip
youll have a good time
caroline closes her eyes
dwight leans back against the headboard of the bed
caroline sits between his legs her back against his chest
with one hand dwight strokes carolines hair
the other hand is curled around her throat
are the prettiest thing ive ever seen
i mean it
the way your hair curls up right there
i just love you so much
i dont know what id do if you ever left me
i couldnt take it
smiles guy i knew in the navy had a saying if you love her heres what to do let her go visit places new
if she loves you shell come back to you
if she dont come back
hunt the bitch down and kill her
laughs thats awful i guess
i dont feel that way but close
my pretty thing
we see that caroline realizes the enormity of her mistake
smoking a cigarette and wearing a nightgown caroline walks to the front door
she opens the front door and stands looking out
then she puts her finger on the door and slowly pushes it shut with one finger
she does this once more
then she does it again
she turns walks toward tobys room
caroline enters and stands by tobys bed
she bends over the boy and she starts to touch his hair decides not to
she stares at toby for a few beats
caroline enters looks down at the sleeping dwight
she gets back into the bed and dwight throws a sleepy hand over her
caroline hesitates but forces herself to put a hand over dwights
through a window dwight dressed in his coveralls leaves for work
caroline is sewing on a machine whilst toby leans against the kitchen sink
but ask him again why dont you
i hate it so much
never stops sewing i asked him a week ago i asked him this morning he wants you to keep the paper route
then make him give me the money
its mine i earned it
he says hell keep it for when you really need it
thats not fair
i ought to be able to have my own money
as caroline shrugs but its mine
you remind me of a baby bird you know those frantic little things with their mouths wide open wanting wanting
well at least ask him about my gym shoes again
i can practice barefoot but for games i gotta have shoes
im not a referee
i wont do it
oh we know we know the bride wont argue
the bride wont raise her voice
well ill tell you what the bride will do the bride will get up and walk over there and slap hell out of the brides son
now does the brides son want his face slapped
oh i hate it here
i wish we could just get up and go
i dont have another get up and go left in me
im telling you ive hit a god damn wall
i cant run anymore
now this whole thing isnt perfect for me either
let me impress that on you real strong okay
i dont wake up singing every morning
but im going to make this marriage work i wont join in any fights you got that
i wont even raise my voice
caroline points to the sink
see those two roses
he picked them for me on his way home last night
im trying to concentrate on the good stuff
norma appears in the kitchen door wearing her cap and gown
she strikes a pose
what dya think
i think i look like a fool
shrugs who cares
six weeks to graduation and california here i come
norma snaps her fingers and goes back to her bedroom
lamely seriously you have to concentrate on the good stuff
caroline turns her attention back to the curtains
the lawrence welk show is on the television
dwight caroline skipper norma and pearl and toby watch an irish tenor sing a lugubrious ballad
dwight stands in a corner of the room his saxophone to his lips
hes playing along with the music but silently
occasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes the saxophone to squawk
the irish ballad ends and lawrence welks champagne orchestra strikes up a lively polka
dwight takes a sip of his drink and grabs caroline pulls her to her feet and begins to dance with her
a polka can be a decorous contained dance
he dances caroline vigorously around the living room out into the kitchen around the table and then back again
dwight is really good and caroline matches him every step of the way
skipper turns the volume up and dwight kicks the dance into an even higher wilder gear the kids clap on the beat the two whirl and stamp and spin
faster and faster carolines heel catches an end table and sends it spinning and faster they go
carolines head is thrown back shes laughing with pleasure
as the music reaches its climax dwight spins caroline back to the sofa lets her go and wham
she lands back where she was seated exactly on the last note of the song
amid the general laughter and applause caroline smiles at toby
breathy try to find the good stuff honey
dwight and toby face one another in the living room
both wear their scout uniforms
dwight holds a box of chocolate coated cherries in one hand
im telling you i didnt
and i know damn well you did
well youre wrong
about some things yeah
not about this
youre a goddam hog and i proved it
how do you know skipper didnt eat it
i told all three of them to stay away from this candy for twenty four hours
well how do you know i even ate any
a triumphant smile i counted them
you hogged down eleven chocolate covered cherries since yesterday afternoon
so that makes you a hog
i just wanted to establish that fact and now i have
caroline and skipper enter carrying throw pillows and materials
to caroline and skipper hey
hotshot hog and ive just been establishing some facts and what we come up with is this one hes a pig who gobbles down everybodys candy two he lies about
it three he lays around on his lazy ass day and night reading reading and four hes not getting any ten dollar gym shoes
thats about what weve come up with so far
a high mincing voice oh dad
skipper leaves the room
caroline sits down begins to try various materials as coverings for the pillows
to caroline why dont you ever take up for me
to caroline why dont you ever help me straighten that boy out
caroline doesnt even look up
she threads a needle and begins to sew
whilst dwight paces around the room
all he does is read or listen to records or sing
he sings five seconds of a grotesque blue monday im so sick of that shit
and when he isnt singing hes watching t
to toby and dont say you dont cause when i come home i always put my hand on top of it to see if its warm and it always is
this is the news kid im wise to you
oh big big deal who cares and as long as were passing out news here i dont want to do my paper route anymore
i bet you dont big lazy candy hog like youd rather lay on his ass and read wouldnt you
let me tell you something youre gonna deliver those papers if i have to walk behind you with a horsewhip ever step of the way
then give me the money i earn
im putting that in the bank for you for when you really need it cuss me now thank me later
mom wont you at least make him let me have the shoes for gym
how can i play basketball without gym shoes
im the only one who toby stops suddenly
he looks at dwight for a beat or two and then speaks in a different tone its not the shoes is it
or the candy
its me isnt it
you just cant stand the fact of me
dwight glances at caroline who still looks at her sewing
i well no its not that i just want you to be well behaved
your rich daddy duke doesnt care anything about you and so somebodys got to train you and one of the things youve gotta be trained about is not to be
a hog and eat everybodys candy like a dwight stops short as caroline says one word
dwight and toby glance at each other nervously
what is this
her eyes still on her sewing soft oh
whats the matter honey
are you sick mom
dont you feel good
a furious caroline raises her head doubles up both fists and yells
taken aback jack i think youve made your mother nervous so why dont we just go on to scouts and let her rest
to caroline you lay down and rest awhile
dwight and toby grab their caps and hotfoot it out the door
father and son photographs are being taken
dwight is the only father who wears a complete uniform and cap
when dwight and tobys turn comes dwight puts on a big smile and throws an arm around tobys shoulder
check for the tongue tonight you forgot it last week
otherwise you wont get your life saving badge
six boys are lying on the floor pretending unconscious ness
six other boys toby among them are going through several life saving steps such as turning the bodies over checking for pulses etc
the boy on whom toby is working is a heavy pimple faced lout
toby checks if the boys breathing is obstructed
gingerly he tugs on the boys chin starting to open the boys mouth
suddenly the boy opens his mouth wide exposing a half chewed mass of cheese n crackers
toby gives the lout a knee in the ribs
laughing give my pud a big squeeze while youre at it why dont you
toby and the life savers on either side of him laugh a bit
as toby kneels down to tie his shoelace a small black dog runs up to him
toby pets it
arthur gayle his black eye healed stands ten feet away
you like my dog
yeah hes nice
smart too he can talk
smiles sure i just about believe you
hey pepper whats on a tree
as pepper barks twice bark
way to go pepper pretty smart
oh i was wondering pepper i wanted to ask you something hows the world treating you
as pepper barks once rough
yeah i know what you mean
a little funny though
how come your dad never comes to meetings with you
i dont have a dad
i sprang full blown from my mothers forehead
you want to walk home with me and pepper
sure compared to a ride home with dwight itll be like heaven on a june day
toby and arthur are eating ice cream cones and smoking cigarettes at the same time
they walk slowly desultorily
though still effeminate arthur has dropped much of the flounciness that he uses in public
your real name is tobias
i like it its very elegant
my real parents would probably have given me an elegant name too
i say real parents because i suspect im a foundling
somebody royal or at least very very beautiful had me and gave me to my poor but honest mother
a beat tell me more about you
shrugs every day of my life feels like a mile on the bataan death march
laughs i knew id like you
whyd you point at me that day
because youre an alien
you dont belong in concrete any more than i do
this place would like to kill us because were different
oh come on arthur
thats a little dramatic
you know what chickens do if one chickens born with a little difference
with a few black feathers on its head say
they peck at the black spot til the chickens dead they cant stand the fact that its different
now were both different
your difference is something other than
husky voiced actress my difference
normal tone but were both aliens here
i dont exactly feel like an alien
ive got friends here
yes and theyre fools
and you act like a fool when youre around them
a prediction if you stay in concrete youll wind up working at the a p either that or youll go on a rampage with a hunting rifle
yeah and youll wind up a recluse that everybody says likes to dress up in his mamas old clothes
laughs maybe maybe but no matter how many times i have to repeat my primary goals to get out of concrete
arthur and toby laugh
as they walk on though tobys face is thoughtful
toby and ten other boys are practicing lay ups
all the boys toby included wear basketball uniforms
all the other boys wear gym shoes
toby is barefooted
he is however a smooth skillful player
toby tosses his last newspaper into a yard folds his sack and stands wearily for a few beats
a large ugly dog next to the box of baseball bats and gloves growls and snaps at toby as he goes past
as toby enters the room norma exits wearing theatrical makeup and a gypsy costume
behind her drink in hand sits dwight wearing a suit and tie watching the television news with the sound very low
whose dog is that on the porch
you said you wanted a dog
a collie though
not this one
well hes yours
you paid for him
go get ready for normas play
what dyou mean i paid for him
but dwight doesnt answer
toby waits then shrugs and leaves the room
toby gets out his book of indian signs
he reaches up for his rifle but it is gone
toby walks in dwight is petting the dog
my winchesters gone
eyes never leaving the tv this dog is pure bred weimaraner
i dont want it
as above well youre purely out of luck arent you cause that rifles on its way to seattle
i want my rifle
well want in one hand and shit in the other see which gets full first
but dwight that winchester was mine
and champs your dog
jesus i trade some old piece of crap for a valuable hunting dog and all you can do is piss and moan
im not pissing and moaning
the hell you arent
you can just make your own deals from now on
toby sits on the front stoop
caroline approaches carrying groceries
she notices tobys expression
dwight traded my rifle for a dog
he says the dogs for me but its some stupid dog he wanted
for a moment caroline doesnt respond
then she nods her head
you stay here
dont come inside
caroline heads inside loaded for bear
norma dressed up for her play and pearl are setting the table
dwight is fixing himself another drink
caroline enters puts down the groceries and goes to the dish cabinet
calmly in total control she takes a plate and smashes it against the countertop
calm get his rifle back
but that dogs a champion
caroline calmly smashes another plate on the countertop
get his rifle back
am i supposed to go clear to seattle just to get
before he finishes the sentence caroline smashes a glass on the countertop
get his rifle back
jesus christ woman i dont even know the guys last name
caroline picks up a bowl
all right all right
the guys supposed to send the a
when he sends em ill know his name and address and ill go get the god damn rifle back
caroline exits leaving dwight norma and pearl with their mouths open
caroline walks to toby sits next to him on the stoop
well i did it and the bride didnt even raise her voice he says hell get the rifle back as soon as the guy who sold him the dog sends
caroline looks up at the evening sky and then shrugs
course having seen that dog i wouldnt suggest you hang by your thumbs til those papers come
i mean that dog is ugly
toby gives her a dirty look but carolines smile makes toby grin
thats nice i havent seen a real smile out of you in a month
oh mom cant we leave here
i hate it so much
you dont like it either all you do is stick your head in a sewing machine night and day
lets just leave and start over someplace else
do you know how many times ive started over sweetheart
i dont want to do it anymore
this is as far as i want to go
i have to make this work somehow
youre fourteen now you have to help me
but me no buts honey
i told you ive hit a wall
and besides its not so bad here if you just try to if you say look for the good stuff im gonna get dwights and shoot myself
seriously though give the place a chance
give him a chance
what a life i gotta live with dwight
i got a sissy for a new best friend
i got no rifle
i got no gym shoes
well look on the bright side
you got a dog
in spite of his disappointment over the rifle in spite of all that caroline had said about staying with dwight toby is happy to see caroline completely back to her
old self again joking with him
he grins and with the palm of his hand he gives her shoulder a gentle shove
she returns the gesture
and the two of them sit on the steps staring into the twilight
arthur is playing the piano
he and toby sing an old song called i wandered today to the hill maggie
both of them are enjoying it
as they finish the song arthur says a dry will you be able to use your musical abilities at the a p
toby laughs and gives him a hard elbow in the ribs
toby is using a nail clipper over a wastebasket when he hears heh hotshot
he looks up just in time to see a flashlight fly through the air toward him
he catches it
dwight stands in the doorway
if you can tear yourself away from your pedicure i want you to fetch me some of that paint from the attic
dwight switches the room light off
is now too soon
dwight and toby are looking for something
they both shine flashlights around the dark attic illuminating old magazines dolls etc
dwight says i know i put em up here somewhere
then tobys flashlight lands on the unusual tub with the four blue stars which had held the beaver
forgotten all this time the beaver has transmogrified into a weird two foot high pile of what looks like cotton candy
and hideously enough the cloud like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver
then dwight says shit the roof mustve leaked on em
toby turns to where dwight shines his flashlight on the ten boxes of chestnuts
also forgotten the chestnuts are covered with mold too but a different kind this is wet slick looking stuff that rises off the chestnuts like dough in a breadpan
a spasm of rage crosses tobys face and he turns and bangs out of the attic
a drink in one hand idly fondling champs ears with the other dwight is watching the news
on the television we see a distraught lana turner and her daughter cheryl crane as the teenaged girl is led into a tall building
while we see this and then a photograph of a stockily handsome italian man we hear cheryl crane daughter of lana turner was held for questioning today in the stabbing
death of johnny stompanato miss turners companion
a spokesman for miss turner said today that the stabbing was an accident and that miss turners daughter will not spend even one night in jail for what the spokesman
called a tragic accident
suddenly aware of another presence in the room dwight turns and sees toby who is standing in the doorway also listening to the newscast
toby is not watching the television though he is staring fixedly at dwight
dwight reacts then glances back at the set where the stompanato murder story continues
he turns slowly back to toby whose eyes are still locked onto his face
the sound on the tv fades
tobys basketball game against the van horn team is starting
alone among all the other players toby wears his street shoes
heavy squarish brogans they clomp and thud as toby runs up and down the court
the leather soles slip like skates on the highly polished floor and toby falls repeatedly
at first the crowd is silent collectively embarrassed at the boy wearing these strange shoes
then toby takes a particularly hard fall and somebody laughs
the crowd in general takes it up and soon there is general laughter whenever tobys shoes squeal particularly loudly or whenever the shoes trip him up or cause another boy
soon one womans high pitched laugh dominates the gymnasium
the laugh is hideous shrill and mindless like some ringer planted in the audience of a situation comedy
toby sees norma necking with some guy and is horrified
toby slips and slides falls and rises
all the while his expression is hard as stone he will get through this or die
and like a mantra he mutters one phrase over and over gotta get out gotta get out gotta get out gotta get out
finally he makes a basket
one voice from the audience yells out okay kid way to go
and then two or three people applaud
instants later toby catches a rebound and makes another basket
the fickle crowd decides to love an underdog and applauds heartily for the boy in the funny shoes
but tobys expression never changes
the buick rolls silently down the driveway pushed by a straining but cautious toby
champ runs into the street toby tries to shoo him away
the dog barks once and toby quickly opens the car door and lets him in starting the engine
toby drives fast leaving concrete behind
he turns the radio on and a voice bawls out oh maybelline toby turns the volume up turns it up again so that the music is distorted
toby begins to accelerate
the needle creeps past ninety and hovers close to one hundred
trees flash past in the headlights occasional cars are overtaken and passed in an instant
toby starts laughing hysterically and sings loudly along with the throbbing the buick begins to shudder and wobble toby hits the brakes but the buick spins and goes sideways into
the car is caught so that two of the wheels are off the ground and can get no purchase
toby starts walking back toward concrete
toby and champ have been walking a long time
a truck comes from behind toby pulls over
that your car in the ditch back there
as toby nods howd you do that anyway
its hard to explain
the man is winching the buick out of the ditch
toby silently closes the garage door the buick inside and heads for the house
the clock shows noon
toby is in bed reading boys life holding a sandwich and trying to stay awake
suddenly dwight appears
dwight puts his hands into his pockets leans against the doorway
your mother said you were sick
yeah i am
get some sleep did you
yeah i slept about four hours
mustve needed it
a pause oh by the way you didnt happen to hear a funny pinging noise in the engine did you
i was downtown with champ a few minutes ago and i met a guy who recognized him
said hed seen my dog this very morning
told me an interesting story of how he and the dog happened to meet
what dyou think about that
i dont know what you suddenly dwight is across the floor and onto the bed
he straddles toby and slaps him across the face with the left hand then the right again and again
toby holds a forearm protectively across his face
dwight holds both tobys hands with one of his and slaps the boys face again and again
finally toby manages to get his right hand loose
he slams his forearm across dwights throat
dwight rears back choking and gagging
toby throws off the covers and tries to run
still choking dwight grabs the back of tobys hair and forces the boys face down against the mattress
then he doubles up his fist and slams it into the back of tobys neck
toby goes rigid with pain
dwight stumbles up gasping for breath
on this whole earth to straighten you out
and i will do it kill or cure
now get your ass up youre going to school
a bell rings as dwights buick screeches to a stop and toby gets out
as he heads toward the doors
toby then turns to stare at dwights car
they lock eyes then dwight smirks and pulls away
toby watches the car disappear then spins around and walks into the school
the camera is in the exact same spot
the school seems a bit seedier and two newly planted saplings established in the previous scene are both eight feet taller with wide spreading branches
students pour out the door
among them toby taller and a bit heavier he now wears black leather boots and a pack of cigarettes rolled into the sleeve of his t shirt
his hair is still pure elvis
toby comes back out the door with four very different friends
chuck bolger the most reasonable looking of tobys companions is the son of a minister
a second boy known as psycho is a hulking boy with a tendency toward sadism
jerry huff is handsome in a pouty heavy lidded way
his elvis pompadour is even higher than tobys
arch cook is an amiable simpleton who sometimes talks to himself or laughs for no reason
toby and his four friends pile into chuck bolgers chevy and they peel out
as the car barrels through downtown concrete we see a movie marquee reading
the apartment and a five foot poster that says in the back seat psycho pours vodka into a half empty can of hawaiian punch then takes a huge swig
screams it ag hhh
oh psycho shut up
pointing oh look there goes carol baumgarten
aint she sweet
shes hot for wolff
wont do her any good though jacks saving himself for rhea clark
knock it off
you know what he said about rhea
said even the inside of her arm turned him on
you slay me wolff
she is pretty though
after a pause wistful id sure like to eat rhea clarks pussy
there is general laughter mixed with groans
god here we eatin pussy jesus give it go again
is all that a rest arch
no i mean it
id like to get down and really grovel on it
spend about a week with my face right in it
there is a pause while all the boys dwell on this thought
it sounds good to them
chuck bolgers car screeches to a halt and toby exits followed by an empty hawaiian punch can which someone tosses after him
toby gives a wave starts toward the house and the car lays rubber while over that we hear psycho screaming agh h h
pearl is setting the table and singing the everly brothers hit bye bye love
the passage of two years has improved pearl
her bald spot has grown back in and she has learned to fix her hair and use makeup
she smiles and nods to toby never stopping her singing for a moment
toby stands next to her and sings harmony for a few notes
it is clear that their relationship has improved
toby stops singing
still singing pearl points to the living room
caroline is watching a newscast of john kennedy and harry truman at a press conference outside trumans missouri office
she hears toby turns to him
we see that the last two years have marked her
her expression is fixed almost as if she were wearing a mask
even the words are cheerful but some of the old optimism is gone
oh honey good news trumans going to campaign for him
lowers her voice i gave twenty five dollars to his campaign office today
ive been thinking id like to work
she is interrupted by dwights voice o
here i am you lucky people
toby and caroline exchange a glance
it speaks volumes
dwight caroline toby and pearl sit at the table eat ing
champ sits by dwights chair obviously his dog
dwight seems unchanged by the two years
just now dwight is in the middle of telling another of his dwight is the best stories
from the bored faces around the table this is another in a long series
so the s
had been on my back for a week at work okay
sayin i stole his wrench an poured oil all over his tools as if
anyway he went just one step too far with old dwight okay
spat on the floor as i walked by
i turned around and walked back to him acting so dainty and humble and scared you know all innocent and the minute he took his eyes off me blam i
dry gulched him
i shut his water off good
never gave me another seconds grief to this very day
there is a pause
one more story
nobody has much of a reaction
i heard kennedy on the news again tonight i dont know i hate the democrats and the republicans but then once in a while somebody comes along who doesnt seem
she searches a liar
kennedy the senator from rome
he gives me hope
i know what he gives you and it sure as hell isnt hope
laughs its true he is attractive
and it may just be those white teeth that i respond to
but i dont think so
a beat im going to work for his campaign
too many republicans in this town
they hear my wifes working for the democrats theyll take their cars someplace else to be fixed
there is a brief silence
suddenly caroline leans across the table and speaks to dwight in a loud exaggerated disappointed whine oh rickyyy
louder same whine oh ricky y y
please let me come down and work at the club
what the hell are you doing
well you treat me like lucy ill act like her
ill be working for kennedys campaign
the four of them are watching the untouchables
we watch as a frightened man speaks to al capone who sits behind a large desk
capone itll never happen again i swear it
it was an accident
i can promise you faithfully it wont be repeated
finally al capone speaks
he leans across his desk bugs out his eyes and hisses
why dont you take a little ride with frank
the mans eyes bulge with fear and he cries no
as two men escort him out the door
in the next shot we see a long black car parked on a country road and we hear a shot
toby is brushing his teeth when dwight enters
ill be through in a minute
dwight looks around
you left the lid off the damn toothpaste again
not looking at him oh dwight is that the best you can come up with
angered but keeping his voice low
he pushes tobys shoulder
this is my bathroom and i say about the toothpaste got it
pushes again huh
now if you lived with your daddy duke and his rich wife maybe thingsd be different but hes not here now is he
high flutey voice oh duke
duke are you here
oh how sad dukes not here
oh boo hoo
normal voice my bathroom
i get to say
still toby doesnt respond dwight reaches out and pinches the skin on tobys waist hard
toby still doesnt respond when dwight begins to twist it
toby spins around eyes blazing
oh come on
give me an excuse
toby hesitates then leaves the bathroom humiliated
toby exits the bathroom then sees caroline in a doorway
shes heard it all
they look intently at each other
toby nods and walks on down the hall
furious toby throws himself onto the bed and snaps on a reading light
behind him the wall is now completely papered with the front pages of the scout magazine so that we see the words boys life boys life boys life boys life
repeated one hundred and twenty times
then toby takes a slick brochure from under his pillow its a bro chure of princeton
photographs of beautifully tended lawns and students on their way to class
toby stares at the photographs smoothing the pages carefully long ing in his face
toby bangs onto the bus throws himself into a seat beside arthur
he hands a grade card to toby
you didnt pick this up yesterday congratulations you got nothing higher than a c
he signs the grade card saying presto
youre gonna get caught some day
as toby laughs a moronic laugh you act more like those morons you hang around with every day
its a good imitation of psycho and toby laughs
he hears you do that youre dead
hey lemme copy your math homework
no but ill show you how to work the problems
i tell you im thirsty you offer me a sandwich thank you and fuck you
i take it back you dont act like psycho you act like dwight
new tone i know it
i do act like him
i feel like him sometimes
ive gotta get out of this place or im a dead one
i know but youve said that for two years
i mean it
i may go live with my brother gregory in princeton
you mean the brother gregory in princeton who never calls you
that brother gregory
he wrote me

like my dad did
what about your grades
and what would you use for money
i dont know
dwight owes me over twelve hundred bucks
if i hadnt let him keep my paper route money id be okay
if the dog hadnt stopped to pee hed have caught the rabbit
suddenly toby is angry
he stands up moves to another seat
i think dwight was right about you i think you fight for the pink team
toby falls into another seat then pulls his head back and bangs it against the window
then does it again harder
his mood even fouler toby toils at his paper route
he throws the papers against the houses with all his might
suddenly chuck bolgers car screeches to a stop next to toby
we hear psychos arghhh
and toby climbs into the car
we see the concrete silo dimly lit in the distance
we can read welcome to concrete on it
toby is leaning against a wall in a large derelict concrete plant staring at the silo
behind him is a small campfire where the other guys are slumped around talking
toby takes a long angry pull on a bottle of whiskey then turns around and heads toward them
nobody in your family ever even been in a corvette let alone owned one
you wait and see if i dont get one
im gonna move down to seattle get a job at bendix and drive a vette to work every day
my uncle can have any car he wants
he makes big bucks as an electrician
hundred seventy five a week take home
fuck you its true
even the supervisors at bendix dont make that
so how are you ever gonna make enough to drive a vette then fuck face
the others all laugh at chuck
toby has reached the group and stands on the lip of the large wooden platform that they are on and listens while leaning on a large hook
im gonna drive a t bird someday
an im gonna own a corvette if i have to hold up the bendix payroll to get it
i want to eat a big red haired pussy
the others all laugh at him
toby regards them with a sneer
what a bunch of losers
who you calling a loser fuck face

to chuck youre gonna drive a fairlane just like your daddy does
to psycho how you ever going to drive a thunderbird when youre a janitor like the rest of your family

yeah youre no better than us
i know that psycho
thats my point ha ha ha
you guys are my buddies
you guys are my pals
and my dear old dads called dwight
he spreads his arms wide welcome to concreeee
toby topples over and falls down a bank of rubble
the other burst out laughing and hooting
the camera moves off them and cranes down to a spread eagled tobys face
the laughter echoes around the building
toby begins to laugh but it soon turns to bitter tears
toby enters the small office where caroline is running hundreds of flyers on a duplicating machine
surprised she sees tobys expression
what is it
i called gregory at princeton
as caroline reacts hes sending me applications for prep schools
i need you to take me to seattle to take some entrance exams
would a prep school take you with uh your school record
ive got to get out of here mom
ive got to
ive got to get away
when are the tests
youll be there
he wont let you have the buick
youll be there
graceful buildings green lawns a carillon chiming
toby walks toward a large building
twenty three boys and toby stand waiting restlessly for the tests to begin
toby looks very different from the other intelligent looking well bred boys in his elvis hairdo
all the boys are taking the test working hard
caroline turns as toby gets into the car
how was it
i think i did okay
ill know monday
dwight sits at the table a drink in his hand
caroline hurriedly prepares dinner
she tosses a milk carton into a brimming waste basket then speaks to toby who enters the room
take that trash out for me honey
toby grabs the trash and exits
toby opens a metal trash can dumps the trash puts the lid back on and then hesitates
he lifts the lid again and peers into the trash can almost hidden are the tips of four white envelopes made of heavy expensive paper
he pulls them up and though covered with tomato seeds are undamaged
toby walks in fans out the four envelopes speaks to caroline
my application forms mustve come today and he threw them away
hey i thought i was helping him thought id save him some trouble cause hes got no chance of getting into some fancy prep school
youve always got your nose pressed up against the bake shop window dont you dwight
you feel like everybody else is inside and youre stuck on the outside
it turns you mean
it turns you ugly
and one day do you hear me dwight
one day all that ugliness is going to snap back and hit you in the face
ooooooh oh im so scared
toby has the applications open in front of him
we see the words official transcript required on one application
on another we see spaces for the ap plicant to list community services and athletic achievements and foreign travel and languages
toby looks despairingly at the forms
between classes toby and arthur are at a row of lockers
i wont do it
you work right in the office nobodyll ever know
im surprised youd want help from anybody who fights for the pink team
im asking you to help me man
i got word yesterday that i did really well on those tests but thats not enough
ive got to cheat and lie but i dont care this is my one chance to get out of here
why should you get to be the one
why not me
toby is working with a table saw
suddenly a two inch thick manilla envelope plops down beside him
he looks up to see arthur standing beside him
glancing around to see that hes unobserved he checks the contents of the envelope we see school stationery blank transcript forms and a stack of official envelopes
toby closes his eyes
you could leave too you know
no ive grown progressively fond of concrete
i think ill stay here all alone and dress up in my mamas old clothes sometimes like you said
arthur turns and swishes away
toby pats the manilla envelope turns back to the saw
suddenly he jerks looks down and sees that the ring finger of his left hand is spurting blood
toby says a mild astonished hey and sinks to his knees
with his hand bandaged toby sits at a typewriter with a blank transcript
he carefully types tobias wolff
then he begins to type the letter a in every slot for grades
toby mails five letters
toby lies in bed reading the paper
he still holds his hand in the air the white bandage is now dingy
caroline appears in the doorway
come help me stuff envelopes
ill do some this afternoon
no i need to take them with me
ill be in in a minute
let me finish this article
boy you irritate me
new tone i think maybe you ought to
yeah i think maybe you should just
hisses toby laughs and gets up to help her
toby starts up the sideway pearl exits the house with several letters in her hand
you got letters from those schools
toby grabs them as if they were the very stuff of life
pearl stands expectantly
toby notices her then walks off holding the letters to his chest
three letters lie crumpled on the ground
toby sits with his back against a tree trunk
slowly toby opens the fourth letter
toby tosses it onto the ground with the others leans his head back against the tree trunk and closes his eyes
dwight caroline and toby read the papers
caroline notices tobys sad face
maybe that last school will come through
yeah or maybe hell get a contract in the mail asking him to be a singing star on t
on carolines look well hes got about as much chance of one as of the other
toby gets up and leaves
a beauty shop with a tired sign
arlenes golden comb beauty salon a beer joint a pool hall a womans clothing store with headless mannequins
toby surveys the scene with an expression of despair
toby catches his reflection in a store window
he stares at himself
a concrete boy
toby wearing khakis a shirt and a tie stands before the store manager
we only take boys who really want to work hard
is that you
as toby nods id want you to start evenings now and id want you all summer no vacations
as toby nods food service work isnt easy
its not something that comes to you in a year or two
you think you have what it takes to be an a p management trainee
straight thats exactly what ive got
toby now wears a regulation black bow tie and an apron
an employee is showing him how to price stamp and stack canned goods
tobys face is expressionless
dwight is listening to a perry como album
caroline and pearl work on a jigsaw puzzle
toby enters the kitchen coming from his paper route
he puts down his paper sack and immediately puts on his black bow tie preparing to go to the a p
i cant find where this green piece goes its gotta be grass
dwight sighs with irritation at the interruption of his listening pleasure and turns up the volume on the record
to toby dont go off without eating
ill get a sandwich after work
exasperated that conversation is continuing when hes trying to listen dwight reaches over presses his hand down on the arm of the record player then scrapes it back and forth
on the record
its a violent action and it makes a grotesque sound
the needle bounces around on the scarred record
as the three of them stare at him dwight speaks calmly i was trying to listen to a record
dwight rises walks outside into the back yard
then the telephone rings
pearl answers it listens then says yeah hes here she holds the receiver out to toby whispering are you tobias
toby hangs up turns to caroline quietly its hill school the last one i applied to
they havent accepted me but theyre sending somebody up to interview me
caroline upsets the puzzle getting up to hug toby
toby is sitting in a booth with mr
howard a man in his late thirties
toby has made a real attempt to look good
his hair is modified and he wears a tie and a suit
yeah i enjoy my classes especially the ones that are advanced but ive been feeling a little restless lately
its hard to explain
well youre probably bored
not being challenged
your application was very good toby but we have many boys who want to go to hill
not everybody is comfortable at a prep school
i think i would be
my father and brother went to prep schools
is that right
deerfield and choate
howard is impressed
well maybe youd like it
hill was difficult for me though classes were hard and the boys seemed cold interested in money and social position
laughs and i hated those snowy pennsylvania winters
but then in my last year something changed
the guys in my class grew close so close that i still think of them as a second family
honest i want that
i do and
he stops talking as we hear o
ag h h h
psycho and arch have entered the drugstore
tobys back is to the door and he slouches deeper into the booth praying that he wont be seen
arch and psycho buy cigarettes
so she said no i dont want you to do that and i said oh baby let me get down and grovel on it
i mean i ate her pussy til my tongue was calloused and then
arch moves toward the back of the store toward the area where toby sits
toby inches down a bit farther into the booth
arch stops at a sunglass rack five feet from toby and tries on a couple of pairs
so anyway she went off like a roman candle i mean that woman can scream
i said you liked that didnt you baby
i said you liked the old arch cook special didnt you
arch decides to let the sunglasses go
he and psycho move toward the front of the store he talks about pussy
toby boys at hill talk roughly sometimes too youd have to be ready for that
i can see youve had sort of a sheltered life
toby nods his head
howard shakes tobys hand
you seem like a fine boy and ill give you a good report tomorrow
but there are lots of boys applying and well just have to wait and see whether from o
we hear dwights voice and toby goes rigid
ohh its the hotshot boy
howard and toby turn to see dwight wearing his coveralls ten feet away
yeah its the guy who thinks he knows everything
thinks hes so smart but fella what you dont know would fill a book
glances at mr
howards new chevrolet offhand general motors makes shit cars
dwight turns and enters the drugstore
weakly thats uh thats this guy
hes a mechanic
did some bad work on our car
its not much of an explanation but mr
howard seems to buy it
he says goodbye to toby gets into his car drives away
toby stares after him
a few weeks have passed
toby his elvis hairdo further modified again prices and stacks food
his face is serious his manner industrious
toby walks in his elvis hair disappearing
pearl who is boiling hot dogs turns i know somethingll make you feel good that man called you got the scholarship
toby grits his teeth and clenches both fists victoriously
he said theyre gonna give you two thousand three hundred dollars a year and it costs two thousand five hundred dollars
so you gotta come up with the other two hundred
sympathetic im making hot dogs ill make one for you
can you put mustard on some bread for us
toby gets a jar of mustard from a cupboard but its empty so he tosses it on top of the trash can gets a new jar and starts to open
whatre you doing home so earl
toby he got that scholarship two thousand and three hundred dollars
dwight makes himself a drink takes two large swallows then turns to toby
i say hey leopard
i know you leopard i can see those spots you cant change
laughs thinks he can go to some fancy prep school and fool everybody
not a chance
i know a thing or two about a thing or two
toby wont rise to the bait and dwight falls silent he looks around and sees the jar of mustard on top of the trash
who threw that away
because it was empty
dwight retrieves the bottle
there are a few streaks of mustard under the neck of the bottle
he holds it close to tobys face
that look empty to you
it looks empty to me
it looks empty to me too
dwight pushes the jar against tobys eye leaving mustard stains on the boys face
look again hotshot
is it empty
toby jerks his head away not answering
dwight slams down the jar of mustard grabs toby by the back of the hair and forces his face down against the mustard jar
to toby now
big time prep school fucker is it empty
toby struggles but dwight has the strength of anger trying always to protect his throbbing finger toby pulls free and jumps up from the table
dwight is too quick for toby though he grabs an even bigger handful of hair and forces tobys face down onto the mustard jar again and again
each time he asks if the jar is empty
finally toby gives up
muffled no it wasnt empty
lets him go all right clean it out
his face smeared with mustard tobys expression is murderous
he picks up a knife and scrapes at the mus tard trying to get up under the neck
he manages to get a few brown and yellow smudges on the knife which he transfers to the edge of a plate
was it empty
slowly he stands up and faces dwight
dwight slaps toby across the mouth and the battle is on
as pearl stands frozen toby lunges at dwight they grapple and stagger around the room
glass shatters the kitchen table crashes over and their feet stamp and shuffle but toby is a wild man
even though he has only one good hand
he lands a blow between dwights eyes that bangs the man back against the wall
dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs flings it at toby
most of it misses
again they grapple
toby manages to throw dwight down then grabs a broom that has fallen to the floor presses it against dwights throat using his good hand and one knee
dwights mouth gapes wide his eyes bulge and he jerks himself frantically trying to dislodge toby but toby hangs on like grim death
desperate dwight grabs tobys bandaged hand bringing it close to his own face and bites the stump of tobys injured finger as hard as he can
toby and pearl scream simultaneously
pearl in horror toby in pain
pearl runs into her bedroom
toby reels back in pain holding his freshly bleeding hand
dwight takes his chance grabs toby by the throat forces him down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy
tobys eyelids begin to flutter
hes losing consciousness
from out of nowhere a baseball bat hits dwight flat across the shoulder blades knocking the breath out of him stunning him momentarily
as he looks up we see caroline one of the baseball bats from the utility porch drawn back aimed at dwights head ready to strike again
level get away from him or i will kill you
toby manages to stand up caroline speaks to both of them
what is this
i got the scholarship and he went nuts
hes crazy and im leaving
screams it im leaving
give me my paper route money and youll never have to see my face again
manages a smile that money is gone with the wind
as toby stares thats right
i spent it as you made it
toby starts for dwight again
caroline grabs him saying no
no over and over literally dragging toby away from dwight
caroline looks at dwight
its not so much that youre disappointing its that youre consistently disappointing
oh fancy fancy talk fancy talk for a whore
i know a thing or two about a thing or two
i got friends in this town that tell me things and i found out some man down at that campaign headquarters found you a job in washington d

caroline takes three full beats and then her face changes
she speaks wonderingly i dont do i

yes you could
caroline takes a deep breath a weight has been lifted
what about me
im leaving too
oh dwight why do you want me to stay
you dont even like me not really
youre not leaving
gentle look again dwight im already gone
dwight makes a terrible noise of frustration and rage doubles his fists and starts toward caroline
immediately toby grabs the baseball bat and holds it out ready to strike as the two begin to back toward the door
you twove always sided in against me always thought you were better than me
i did the best i could
what about me
am i supposed to just crawl off in a ditch someplace and die
ive always been the nigger
ever since i was little
caroline and toby are at the door run across the yard and down the street
dwight stands in the doorway yelling what about me
when is it ever dwights turn for some consideration
what about me
ill tell you one thing youll remember me
caroline and toby slow to a walk after running laughing and catch their breaths
man oh man
man oh man oh man

carolines smile becomes fixed during tobys speech and she begins to regard him oddly
weakly yeah heaven on a june day

so now you can go
i am so damn glad to get out of this place

carolines eyes well up and she lights a cigarette
notices shes upset what
oh dont cry hes not worth it
as sad as she is caroline smiles
she holds toby at arms length and studies him
my youve grown havent you
then clutches him to her fiercely
smiling the two walk on through the sunny afternoon singing softly to each other
caroline and toby stand next to a bus as the driver starts the engine
she is close to tears
are you sure youll be all right
nice get on the bus
stuffing bills into his pocket i borrowed money from everybody i know its the two hundred you need for the tuition and an extra fifty
buy yourself a blazer
ill miss you

caroline puts her arms around toby kisses his cheek hard then whispers something into his ear
when toby speaks his words are full of love i know that mom
ive always known that
caroline gets onto the bus the doors close whoosh and the bus pulls away
we see carolines face at a window
as the bus recedes toby turns and walks in another direction
his face is shining incandescent with happiness
he breaks into a wide grin
