b if window
href b b by frank pierson final draft it fills the screen designed to exactly fill the frame size of whatever ratio were shooting in
it says this message will be a little cryptic to the movie audience on an essentially black screen
hold for a beat then it changes the lights flash this sign which should explain it to everyone and a slow distant roll of thunder in the far distance now
the sound of media begin to come up loud under long shot down the avenue mm lens heat waves shimmering thousands of old people and people with children in strollers moving restlessly about in the heat on those endless miles of benches
the shot is on screen only for a beat or two then gone
the situation continued tense in the middle east today as
an unnamed player swings and hits a high pop up
hits a high inside pitch foul into the upper stands
as the ball comes down they scramble and fight for it
a touch of viciousness
b s meanwhile unleashed the heaviest bombing of the war
we are seeing heidi though we dont know it yet shes just another pretty pound italian girl with two kids kimmy jimmy about four and five years old
right now she is a lump of browning flesh shining with oil among rows of similar ladies mostly thinner but all with a certain unhealthy softness about them laid out
in rows and groups across the sand
shoot low and long so heat shimmers rise as though the heat were baking the oil out of this mob visible suntan oil pollution
heidis transistor blasts rock music into the air
roberta flack etc
the american high command announced the famed th cavalry division would be coming home
the th cavalry long since afoot hardened in battle in the jungles of world war ii
it is parked in a drab brooklyn street
beside the car stands sal medium height also good looking in an intense boyish way
his eyes dart about suspiciously the ever watchful sal
there is a watchful reserve in sal that contrasts to sonnys outgoing bounciness first impression is sonny is all bark sal is the bite
sal is dressed in impressive blue suit style he looks like a kid trying to impress the godfather
he even wears a hat
now matching sals preparations inside the car he checks his ties alignment shoots his cuffs and is ready
meanwhile on their car radio amoreena as he turns from the back of the car jackie appears with a huge florist box tied with ribbon
jackie is an eighteen year old with bad complexion and in contrast to sonny and sal is dressed in teenage sloppiness
adidas t shirt bowling jacket jeans
he is uncertain waits for directions from sonny
sonny takes the florist box from him
we see a water truck drive down the street followed by sonnys car which drives up near bank
it stops jackie gets out crosses to bank window peers through then returns to car
leans in has fake conversation with sonny
they are waiting
sonny checks his watch turns to sal in back seat seconds sal
at appropriate moment sal exits car walks toward bank
slowly sonny gets out
a slightly seedy little branch bank old yellow brick blond varnished wood a rubber plant an american flag
through the windows we see howard the aged black bank guard in uniform taking down the american flag from outside
past him comes sal carrying an attache case
he passes howard coming toward us through the door into the bank
as he passes as it clicks from to pm
as he moves toward the left hand deposit slips desks
he picks out a car loan application slip then walks toward the managers desk as the sign on the desk proclaims of patrick mulvaney
sal sits down his back to mulvaney facing the front door of the bank
mulvaney is on the phone
as sonny bustles through in his bouncy dancers walk
he carries the large florist box
he moves toward the left hand deposit slips desks takes one out and begins to fill one out
as he pulls out the keys attached to the belt of his uniform
jackie approaches the door of the bank and stops neither in nor out as though he cant make up his mind
howard watches him waiting patiently keys in hand folded flag under his arm
still sitting back to mulvaney watching jackies approach and entrance ready to move on cue
on howard as he looks at jackie still half in half out
howard speaks to him closing time you want in or out
jackie steps in and as howard locks the door to prevent more customers from entering jackie walks toward sonny filling out a slip at the left hand area
camera follows jackie
he stops at deposit slips desk next to sonny
as if by pre arranged signal sal now stands up moves to the side of mulvaneys desk
you the manager
who is still on the phone
he gestures at the sign on his desk that says so and gestures for sal to sit down
as he sits producing as he does a machine pistol which he holds on mulvaneys chest out of sight from others in the bank
his mouth simply stops and he stares at the gun
mulvaney is a comic opera irishman in his early fifties florid
cheerful bushy eyebrows he acts out everything he says
just go on talking like nothing was happening okay
into phone listen lemme call you back
he hangs up and looks from the gun up to sals blank hard face
to his own amazement he grins a hopeful grin that says like me dont hurt me
and hes embarrassed by it
as we watch his smile turns sour
sals absolutely unmoved face
jackie moves over to sonny
sonny im gettin real bad vibes
jackie what are you talking about
maybe we can take something smaller
like a spanish grocery
indicating whats happening with sal and mulvaney its too late just get away from me dont talk to me now go over to your place
jackie moves to another deposit slips desk takes one out and begins to fill it out
as a lady with a baby in a stroller moves away from the teller and starts to walk toward the front door
deborah is marking figures on a piece of paper at st tellers cage
sylvia and miriam stand behind her their backs to sonny
howard who has put the folded flag in a plastic bag in a front desk follows lady toward the door
he unlocks the door and hands the baby a lollipop courtesy of the bank and she exits the bank
glancing at clock taking a sharp deep breath
staring at mulvaney
the ruins of his smile still on his face
straightens up from locking the door the figure of the lady and the baby can be seen receding outside
seeing that the bank is closed locked in with no customers crosses toward the front tellers cage area carrying the florist box
as he reaches the other side he rips open the box and takes the rifle out and aims it level onto sylvia ball the teller who automatically takes the closed
sign and holds it in front of her face as though to protect herself from the rifle
holding sign in front of her face sorry this window is shut
as mulvaney stands and yells to sylvia
as margaret an accountant comes out of the ladies room starts to cross downstage toward her desk sees what is happening and momentarily freezes in her tracks
the cues have got all fucked up but hes so programmed and ready he cant adjust so the speech he had ready comes out now okay this is a stickup
this is a fucking stickup
just freeze now goddammit
get away from your desk
get in the center get in the center
sylvia and edna start to move toward the rear of the bank toward margarets desk
aghast at his own outspokenness
sal holding the gun levelled on him
we know its a stickup
to jackie re howard if he moves blow his guts out
jackie staring at the real guns turns to sonny
im sorry sonny
i cant make it
jackie starts to move toward the front door
hey for christs sake
turns to sal he cant make it
fuck him let him out
sonny yells out at frozen howard
let him out
yells do what the gentleman says howard
sonny sees that howard is useless so he runs to howard grabbing the keys from him and pulls howard along with him to the front door
jackie unlocks the door and jackie with a last apologetic glance gives his gun to sonny and vanishes into the sweltering afternoon
sonny then frisks howard and has a sudden afterthought as he locks the door again
he quickly unlocks it and shouts out at jackie
hey dont take the car
on sidewalk well howll i get home
take the subway
we need the car
as jackie starts to walk away hey gimme the keys the keys
jackie stops fumbles for keys crosses back to sonny with them
points to fig
desk sonny theres somebody under that desk over there
sonny turns into the bank once more as jackie walks off toward the subway pointing inside at a desk near the window as he does to point something out to
sonny re entering the bank speaks to howard
sonny now crosses to desk that jackie indicated as everyone watches him as though its all in the game
taps loudly on top of desk hey
get outta there
nobodys gonna hurt you
jenny a young frightened girl peeks out from under the desk obviously afraid to reveal herself
sonny starts to move toward the front of the bank
sal turns so he can cover everyone
sonny turns to order howard
pull the drapes
howard doesnt move
howard belatedly leaps to work pulling drapes that screen off the interior from outside
the door has no drapes or blinds and thus when the drapes are closed there is a corridor of space across the street we will always be able to see
and from which people outside will always be able to see in
as howard finishes the task he then walks back to the huddled group on the rear
on his way to the back of the bank is digging into his jacket pocket he swings around as he passes the camera that is bolted to a wall bracket
covering the tellers area
he whips out a spray can and gives the lens a shot of red paint
there are three cameras in all each of which he sprays
grinning no replay folks
after spraying the three cameras he has reached mulvaneys desk area
the girls are scattering to group farther back and sonny and mulvaney are heading for the vault
on cross to vault with sonny were hip
lets just get you all fixed up and on your way
miriam a young awkward overweight jewish girl chewing gum with nervous machine like rapidity moving toward the vault
the gate is closed and she holds one key and mulvaney the other
they pass sal who now holds the others in the bank under his gun while at the vault gate
okay is the vault open
i can take care of that
mulvaney is about to insert his key in his lock
sonny quickly reaches out and grabs mulvaneys hand and looks at the key he has extended
son of a bitch
he almost hits mulvaney with his fist
what the fuck you tryin to do
trip the alarm
use the spur key
use the other one
hes grabbed the keys from mulvaney and holds up the key mulvaney was going to use
were in a sonny holds the key right in the middle of the frame where mulvaney and the audience can see the key has a tiny projection or spur at
if this key is used the spur triggers a silent alarm
i must of been outta my mind
furious well you get your mind right
im a catholic and i dont wanna hurt nobody but goddamn it dont you play no games with me
mulvaney nods and picks out a key that is identical except for the spur
he shows it to sonny
as mulvaney carefully uses the safe key to unlock the gate
miriam is crying as she unlocks her side
the gate swings open
sonny shoves mulvaney inside and as he passes miriam notices her tears
she just stands there staring into his face like a hypnotized chicken the tears streaming down her face
sonny stops staring at her
mulvaney starting to open the gate moves inside the vault impatient
lets get you on your way
miriam open the safe
whats the matter with you
to miriam come on lemme load you up
there isnt any money
sonny looks at mulvaney alarmed
they picked it up this afternoon
moves inside the vault theres only about four thousand in singles and maybe a few hundred in larger bills
hes going to kill us
sonny storms into the vault
as mulvaney pulls a cash drawer out to show sonny even we can see there isnt much there
sonny searches for more finds nothing
this is it
what am i gonna do with this
its all we got
okay dont worry about it
stick it in the bag
at this sonny pulls out a plastic bag from his pocket hands it to miriam who opens it and puts the money into it
as he turns we see that miriam is still staring at him terrified and as his rifle swings around she reels back with a little screech of terror
lets go sonny
suddenly gentle what are you crying for
its not your fault theres no money
shes afraid youre gonna shoot
hands sonny the bag of money sonny starts out of the vault toward the tellers area with bag of money
he speaks to mulvaney
what the hell would i shoot her for
miriam follows sonny to tellers cages gate
he carries the bag
answer the phone
mulvaney crosses to his desk picks up the receiver
sal follows him yanks receiver from one ear to the other so he can hear conversation
to miriam okay
miriam crosses to gate presses the necessary button and the gate opens from them
sonny watches this carefully noting where the buzzer button is
he crosses in front of the drawer at the first cage
he tries to open the drawer
its obviously locked
okay whos the head teller here
open this up
sylvia comes forward and unlocks the first drawer and begins to remove the cash but sonny grabs her hands
dont take it all out
he grabs a piece of paper or cardboard
he takes all the singles but one out of the singles slot in the drawer leaving the bottom single in place
it is held there by a metal clip
he carefully slips the paper under the clip and then removes the single
it is clear this is an automatic alarm meanwhile
boy i cant trust a one of you
i worked in a bank i know the alarms so dont try to fool around with me
as they move to nd cash drawer at nd tellers cage
sylvia unlocks the drawer and starts to reach in for the cash but sonny pushes his hand into the drawer instead
he begins to stuff the money into the bag
some fives packaged with rubber bands in the drawer he holds up so sal and all can see them
decoy money right its marked
he throws it into the air so the bills flutter all around him gaily
in the background mulvaney having finished with the phone conversation is moving to the rear with the rest of the girls
sonny now moves to the rd cages cash drawer
mulvaney ends phone conversation and sal moves him over to group at vault
mimicking sylvia this window is shut
again the same procedure begins
sylvia unlocks the cash drawer and sonny starts to scoop it out and put it into the opened plastic bag that miriam holds
cheer up youll be the veteran of a robbery the bank sends you a dozen red roses you know that
at this point the phone begins to ring again yelling to sal sal let him answer the goddamn phones theyre driving me crazy
look at this chicken shit
again mulvaney starts to cross back to his desk again followed by sal
sonny yells out to mulvaney as he crosses to answer the phone
hey you manager
dont get any ideas fucker
see that man there
i bark and he bites
believe me im on your side
my side shit
they move to drawer
listen we got young girls here
you could watch your language
i speak what i feel
im sorry i cant talk to you right now
i suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow
what is your name
gimme the travelers checks and the register
they cross toward the last drawer area
miriam is still crying silently
sonny holds out the plastic bag for the checks for her
she drops it
its not necessary
with everything in the bag sonny now takes the register and starts to move the two girls toward the rear near the vault
can you hurry it up
as he moves toward the rear sylvia and miriam now re joining other women to get a wastebasket
accomplishing this he starts to burn the pages of the register tearing out pages as he does so
its smokey as hell but not burning well
he drops it smoking into the wastebasket
to howard hey you
give me the keys
were gettin outta here
gasping for breath huh
the old man is panicked great patches of sweat spreading around his armpits
he breathes in asthmatic gasps now he flinches at his name as though hes been hit
stands receiver still to ear then covering it with his hand howard give him the keys
gimme the keys to get outta here
howard is unable to move
seeing his predicament edna moves to him and starts to unfasten his belt to remove the keys
mulvaney continues with his phone conversation
who now crosses to howard and edna losing patience with the situation
as he moves closer howard backs away from him frightened by his rifle
seeing that sonny puts it down and looks over to sal for coverage
as sonny approaches howard he realizes that he cant get close enough
take it easy
just gimme the keys
im not gonna hurt you
listen calm down huh
youre gonna have a heart attack
just gimme the keys
thats all i want
howard gives him the keys and as sonny starts to walk back toward the burning register
with mulvaney still on the phone
looking past camera falling onto the floor behind mulvaney sonny
across the street
who now starts to move quickly toward the front of the bank being sure to hide behind the posts as he moves
on phone no it was the credit rating
the credit rating
i dont know youd have to find that out from him
sonny has now reached the front of the bank
he carefully peeks out through the closed draperies to look outside
a man in a business suit sweaty and harassed looking is walking from an insurance office across the street directly toward the bank
the man continues coming straight toward them and us
sonny starts to run back to get his gun from margarets desk
mulvaney is still on the phone
it was something a couple of years ago in st
louis i dont know
sonny grabs the gun from the desk top and moves over to mulvaney
the man walks straight toward the glass door already lifting his hand to shadow his eyes so when he reaches the door hell be able to see inside
sal brings the gun up so he can shoot the man at the same time crabbing himself aside so he is concealed behind mulvaney and the desk
mulvaney sees the approaching man and cups his hand over the phone
its the insurance guy across the street
he probably saw the goddamn smoke
motions toward smoking register please
put out the fire
the last few feet from the door
who rushes through the tellers cages gate toward the register grabs the smoking register throws it onto the floor near ednas desk and starts to stamp it out
ill get some water
before anyone can move sonny grabs the gun on them all
the women now begin to scream as real hysteria sets in
deborah screams collapses
the man actually kicks the glass with his foot then leans against the glass shades his eyes trying to see in
i cant talk now
ill call you back
sound of hanging up
the man is looking all around
get rid of him
howard wave him off
tell him were closed
who is useless
who starts to move toward the front door looking over at sonny trying to put out the fire
camera follows mulvaney to the front door sonny moves with him covering him all the time
as sonny stands behind closed venetian blinds to listen to the conversation and to cover mulvaney
the guns right on your back
give me the keys
sonny hands him the keys
he raises the gun and sights it now and in this moment we should sense a kind of luxurious relaxation into anticipation on sals part
he is smiling a little and for the first time looks happy and thats what makes him seem dangerous
hes looking forward to an excuse to kill
its here now survival
there is something almost sexual about the way he settles his body down behind the weapon getting ready for the squeeze on the trigger the report the violent shove of
recoil against his muscles and sinews
in the background we see sylvia bringing howard a cup of water
emphasizing the small of mulvaneys back
the man is somebody he knows from across the street
he looks worried and mystified
unlocking door what is it sam
everythings all right
yeah just a cigarette got in a wastebasket
sam stares around
you all right
little smoke like a polish four alarm fire is all
well youre okay
yeah thanks for keeping an eye out
hes not satisfied but he cant see anything and he cant think of anything more to say so
thanks again sam
im glad its okay
regards to the family sam
mulvaney locks the door and walks inside the bank giving the keys back to sonny
for gods sake will you please go now
we gave you every nickel we got
youre goin outside with me
if theres no cops around we just split
otherwise you go with us
mulvaney and sonny starts to walk back toward sal
as they do the phone begins to ring again
to mulvaney answer it
mulvaney shrugs helplessly
picks up the phone standing at desk opposite his
yeah its all right
hello mulvaney here
sal get em in the vault
wheres the money
get em in the vault
as sal starts to herd them into the vault sylvia helping howard still with the cup of water mulvaney is still on the phone
sonny moves down to get the money bag atop the tellers cages and we hear mulvaney on phone
tired what property is that mrs
the third avenue property you already got a second mortgage on
we discussed it before
the girls are afraid miriam unlocks the gate as sonny uses mulvaneys keys to the matching lock
from inside vault area you wont close the vault
how can we breathe
no thats okay
just close the gate
sylvia helping howard is the last to go through the gate
as sonny is about to lock the gate she turns to him
listen ill never make it
ill have to go to the toilet
whats the matter
they never housebroke you
its not a joke
i got this terrible fear of being locked in
anybody else have to go
me too please
now they all gotta go
as sylvia starts to move out sonny starts to cross ahead of her
wait a minute i want to check
mulvaney finishes his phone conversation
he moves toward the group at the vault
as sonny sprints for the door to the ladies room
it is a little lounge sitting on a couch under the window making up her face or painting her toenails and listening to her tiny transistor radio oblivious to all
thats happened is maria heavily painted and voluptuous latin girl
sylvia following him in is shocked
shes forgotten about maria
now she runs over to her puts her arms around her
who the hell is that
god damn it
maria is about to protest but sylvia grabs her and starts to hustle her out
what are you trying to pull
i forgot shes in here
come on nobodys going to the bathroom come on
he moves with them back to the vault area herds them into it
at this point phone rings again
sonny moves to get the empty wastebasket shoving it into the vault for the girls to use in case of emergency
mulvaney moves to his desk and phone
mulvaney has by this time answered the phone and is now holding it out to sonny
hold the beat
to sonny its for you
they both stare at mulvaney
sonny slowly moves toward mulvaney
for the first time since he entered the bank hes quiet and slow
he takes the instrument and slowly puts it to his ear
the group from the vault now slowly starts to move out to listen to the conversation
into phone yeah
what are you doin in there
this is detective sergeant moretti asshole we got you completely by the balls
you dont believe me im lookin you right in the eye
right now i can see you
who is it
sonny turns and looks out through the door
sure enough in the window of the barbershop across the street the dim figure of a man on a telephone can be seen looking out toward us
he wears a hat in spite of the weather and a cigar is clamped in his mouth
he is an old time hard nosed uneducated street wise sarcastic new york cop outspoken rude and sentimental
right now hes a distant silhouette and a voice on the telephone
holding the phone
listening to the voice of his death speaking in new york accents
lets be reasonable and not stupid and not get anybody hurt
you come to the front door with hands folded on your head unnastand
nobodys gonna shoot or
sonny slowly almost sadly puts the telephone receiver back down cutting off the little voice at the other end
he looks up at mulvaney then to sal
to sal its the cops
howd that happen
backing away from sonny i swear to god
on my salary im not gonna be any hero
i took too long
it was the fire asshole
i told you just go get out when you could but no you just got to hang around
sonny is pacing back and forth trying to figure out what to do
i gotta have time to think
what is it
did you just barge in here
he doesnt have plan
its all a whim
sarcastic rob a bank
just give me time to think
were all in the barrel together
phone continues to ring
sonny finally grabs it desk opposite mulvaney
into phone all right bastards
you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time
you got that
a startled apologetic mans voice speaks now another phone i just called to ask jenny what time shes gonna get off
its her husband
sonny abruptly holds the phone out from his body at arms length disgusted
is there a jenny here
they all stare at him
finally he singles her out
its your husband
jenny starts to move toward sonny
what do i say
tell him the truth
tell him whatever you tell him
as he puts down the phone for her to pick up sonny reaches for the other phone that is ringing
what a fuckin comedy
into phone wnew plays all the hits
listen first off is anybody hurt in there
but you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time
you got it
he hangs up the phone
sal looks at him
you mean that
the bodies out the door
i want him to think that
but do you mean it
at this moment jenny phone in hand is turned to him respectfully like a child in an authoritarian household addressing her father he wants to know what time you think
youll be through
stares at her
for the first time he realizes how frightened she is how serious grotesque and funny it all is
he takes the time to be tender with her as though she were a not too bright child in the presence of a tragedy shell never understand
tell him i dont know
now sonny turns to speak to mulvaney
wheres the back door
its locked on the inside
beat its through that passageway and to the right
sonny disappears toward the back door
jenny continues her phone conversation
he says he doesnt know
why dont you cook whatevers there
it looks like a whole roast
honey send out for kentucky fried chicken
the baby just open a bottle of prunes and one of the beef
the bottles are in the fridge
to jenny hurry up
i know how to fix the bottle
they got guns
with the baby on her mind what guns
the robbers in the bank
they got guns
a lot of guns
well stay away from them
dont get close
oh yeah i will
now sonny returns from the rear door area sees that shes still on the phone and signals to her to hurry up
hey jenny lets go
i got to go
i love you
everyone is looking at her
they look away as though to give her privacy
well i got to go now
a beat of silence
realizes she cant talk
ill kiss the baby for you
past embarrassment i love you
she hangs up and then crosses to the group by the vault
on sonny as he moves to sal to reassure sal out of some guiltiness about trapping him in this situation
his tone apologetic
sal im sorry about this
but we can get outta this thing
theres a way outta this
are you serious
about throwin a body outta here if we have to
well i stalled him for a while
when it comes the time then well work it out
but do you mean it
but you just told him that if worse comes to worse
i want him to think that
but i want to know what you think
we wont have to
ill tell you right now that im ready to do it
now sonny moves over to the group at the vault gate and speaks to them
what i want to say is
everythings gonna be all right
if we all cooperate and we dont you know
i dont know you and you dont know me
and what im tryin to tell you is that if you stay cooled out we can work this thing out and nobodys going to get hurt
believe me i dont want to hurt anybody
everybody is going to have a chance to do what they have to do
shes gotta go to the bathroom so you go and you can go after
everybodys gonna get a chance
everybodys gonna get a chance to use the phone
lets just take it a step at a time
sonny now turns toward mulvaney
howard lies down head on jacket in the vault
to mulvaney now you whats your name
you and me are checking the other ways in and out
sal takes a position where he can cover the door and also the girls and howard
as sonny and mulvaney move toward the rear of the bank
lets go to the back door
referring to howard howd that guy get to be a guard
well they go to guard school
learn how to shoot
they dont get a gun
they make a week to start
they fold the flag check the place out in the morning
i dont know what they learn sonny
at some point in their move toward the rear door sylvia exits the ladies room and moves back toward the group
here we are
the back door
they look at it
it is big black steel and seems solid
sonny tests it
they could shoot the lock
i want to block it so if they try comin here were gonna hear it
here you pull on that side
puts gun aside he has found a big office machine a xerox or whatever which he now starts to push toward the door
on the opposite side mulvaney starts to pull it toward the door
its very heavy and they have to strain to budge it at all
meanwhile you got kids
i got two kids
and id like to see them again
ah i know
youre being very cooperative
i got no complaint against you whatever you got bank insurance
mulvaney has removed his suit jacket
you know i do
you seem to know a lot about bank procedure
sonny laughs and pushes the machine
mulvaney pulls from the opposite side
dont ask me questions
i got connections
you find out who i am youre cold meat
i dont care who you are
shove i just want to get you outta here safe right
what if i take you with me
stopping to rest for a beat thinking if you take anybody please take me
theyll shoot you the fucking copsll shoot you
they dont give a damn
in spite of that bank insurance
you see what they did in attica they shot everybody the hostages prisoners cops guards forty two people they killed the innocent with the guilty
they have the machine almost to the door now with mulvaney almost pinned between the machine and the door
he eases himself out
looks at the gun then at sonny then they shove the machine against the door
sonny then gives mulvaney his jacket to put on again
anyway im not gonna take you
im gonna take one of the girls a married one with a couple of kids
the cops dont like it in the papers when they kill a mother especially if shes got young kids
finished with the task sonny takes his gun and with mulvaney they start to cross back toward sal and the rest of the group
youre just a nice guy mr
only dont fuck around with me you know what i mean
i dont fool around with you
mulvaney crosses back to his desk and sits down
at this point all the phones are off the hooks
as it banks steeply we can see past pilot to bank and cops around car
we see a small crowd being held back by a few police still setting up barricades
it is the first indication of the crowd event it became
it also sets the geography for us but very quickly another copter swims into view and the two circle each other
the other copter only feet away is a tv news helicopter with a big camera sticking out the open door on our side
it is turned down by the cameraman to focus on the bank
a cop in the police helicopter yells through his bullhorn at the tv cameraman
this is a restricted area
you are flying in a restricted area
the tv cameraman swivels his camera up to focus on the cop and as the lens hits us dead center
though an open window a fire escape can be seen and beyond it an angle of street and the bank
near the window in a corner is a tv set and on the tv set we are seeing the shot of the police helicopter and the cop yelling on the
bullhorn as seen from the tv copter
a couple of elderly men are sitting watching the tv set ignoring the bank which they can see in the flesh as it were
outside we are hearing the copters and on the tv set likewise and the voice of the announcer
police as yet have made no contact with the bank robbers who are locked in the bank
there is a hammering at the door and the men at the tv set barely have time to look around before several burly cops wearing flak vests and helmets and
carrying sniper rifles with telescopic slights move through the room ignoring the men
they move out onto the fire escape a couple going up higher settling themselves down to aim in their rifles on the front of the bank
a lot of ad lib dialogue but what we note is the cops as a man take a look at themselves on the tv
the frame is full of cop faces
tough mesomorphic faces with a layer of fat under the skin increasing as age
they have the look of cops alert curious weighing
they are city cops they dont have that old fashioned condemnatory expression there is an element of playfulness in their nature the fact is they love their work which is
there is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impulse in everybody and a matching fury in punishing it which is the action of repressing their own strongly developed
these are tense funny violent and rigidly controlled men
moretti is an old line cop a lot more relaxed than the younger men and the cold professionals of the fbi who as a group resemble astronauts and like them
hide but do not deny the psychic chaos underneath
right now they are looking at the sky
we hear a heavy helicopter track
we feature sheldon the silver haired fbi agent in charge who looks like an accountant and moretti with hat and cigar and a face out of warner brothers movies of
in spite of sheldons age moretti plays though hes a smart kid who still needs a little help
sheldon is getting out of a gray car wears a gray suit
three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ages
the three hang around him
they approach moretti who looks at them without moving
to no one here comes the fbi
to sheldon you men lookin for protection
we got all the police right here
why didnt you just wait and try to take em out there in the street
moretti looks at him cheerfully sarcastic
i made an error in judgment
i thought the sons of bitches would be overwhelmed with remorse at the sight of a police officer
and you know somethin
nobody has said hostage yet
they are moving past cops on the corner heading toward a small barbershop across the street from the bank
we now sense the growing crowd standing quietly just staring not yet knowing whats going on
from down the street come a group of odd looking men in suits carrying all kinds of electric junk the new reporters
they run heavily sweating martinis and cigarette smoke
they run up to moretti and sheldon who walk along trying not to catch an eye
how many in the bank
have they got hostages
any shots exchanged
ad lib no we dont know that yet
this young fella without the hat is fbi
im detective sergeant eugene moretti m o r e double t i
i dont give a shit but my wife cries if you spell it wrong
they have arrived at the barber shop where moretti fights his way inside
a cop is talking on the wall phone as moretti baker etc
are trying to get inside
no just get hold of al tell him to get the catering truck over to th and avenue b theres a bank robbery in progress and big crowd
tell him to bring ice cream i got to hang up
he hangs up and immediately begins thumbing through a pocket phone book
throughout this cop is engaged in personal business on the fringe of this affair and though hes on duty he hardly knows whats happening on the robbery
hes trying to get his brother in law with the ice cream truck down here etc
moretti has got the crowd cleared back so that now we see why this has been chosen as a tactical command post
from here while talking on the phone moretti can see the bank and through the uncurtained door he can even see some distance inside
moretti picks up the phone
to phone cop you get the phone company
its being set up
this phonell be a direct line into the bank
moretti is already dialing
the phone is answered
re morettis rd conversation on phone with sonny
the group inside the bank have now been waiting approximately twelve minutes since anything last happened
sonny is seated at mulvaneys desk all the phones off the hooks
the rest of the group is huddled around the vault area where sal is keeping his eye on them
suddenly sonny jumps up and puts all the receivers back on the hooks crossing back to sit at mulvaneys desk again
phone starts to ring and sonny picks it up
okay youre in there and were out here
what do we do now
i told you keep away
i dont know what we do now
awright but i wanna talk to you
first off we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay
you alone or you got confederates
im not alone
how many you got in there
i got sal
whats that for
hes the killer
were vietnam veterans so killing dont mean anything to us you understand
a cop passing by presses a portable two way radio into morettis hand he accepts it and holds as though he expected it
the cop passes the same type of set to certain other officers
these sets are tuned in to each other and throughout the movie there is a constant background talk on these sets
this is police procedure the orders are for everyone to talk about everything
if anyone has a question has heard a rumor or a sound whatever it is immediately responded to so that there can be the fewest possible surprises
sample dialogue might go did i hear a shot
over here by the bank there was a report like a gunshot inside
roger we heard that from the barbershop
it was inside the bank
barbershop you can see inside
roger we heard from the barbershop
it was inside the bank
barbershop you can see inside
roger this is the barbershop we see inside the perpetrator is moving toward the rear of the bank
whos that guy walking through the barricade
the blue suit

they really do use the word perpetrator felon etc
the cop handing out radios makes moretti sign for it which moretti does during the following right got ya

im bein reasonable with you give me somethin

so you want me to send one out there
ill see what i can do
sonny hangs up and moves over to sal
the rest of the group has been trying to make out whats being said at the other end of the conversation
to sal he wants one
dead or alive
now sonny looks at the group
whos gonna go first
mulvaney now stands up at his desk looks over at the group near the vault
they look back at him waiting for some instructions
its up to you ladies
they are now unified
sonny whispers something to sal
to show that were negotiating
send them the guard
sylvia takes howard by the arms and starts to lead him toward the front door
sal watches as they move toward front door
cover her sonny
sonny moves with them toward the front door his gun aimed at them during the walk
finally they arrive and howard moves toward the door by himself
but the door is obviously locked
he needs the keys
sonny gives her the keys
from the rear only one sonny
sonny covers sylvia as she moves to unlock the front door for howard
go along howard
as howard is pushed out the door by sylvia a cop from a nearby car rushes up to him and shoves him to a curbside car where he bends howard
over the car putting his hands behind him for handcuffs and starts to frisk him
about weapons ranging from machine guns to hand guns to sniper rifles are whipped up and pointed straight at his chest and head
the effect is as though he is about to be blown entirely away
moretti rushes out screaming to the cop with howard
did he say fire
do we fire or what
they dont know if the perpetrator or not since they havent yet seen sal or sonny
guns are up aimed being pushed down
cops run for better vantage points
as moretti reaches him
he pulls the cop away from him and starts to give him hell for the rough treatment being given the guard
with sylvia in doorway staring wildly at the street scene
sonny is beside her covering her with his rifle
we voted to send him out
as the cops slowly realize their mistake
they stand back from howard who is virtually catatonic with fear and shock now
they get him up a reluctant to believe they could have made such a mistake
near barber shop across the street jockeying trying to focus in on him elbowing each other they yell out hey
come out get in the light
hey out where we can get a shot huh
whos the black guy
ad libs swings in over street to try for a shot
howard is being taken in the direction of the barber shop
get him outta here
sonny back in the shadows with sylvia looking at moretti appalled
behind him a mob scene
howard is being led away weeping
photographers cops a phalanx of cops have their weapons levelled on sonny like a firing squad
it is right on the edge of violence
of blowing up
sonny and sylvia are in the shelter of the doorway moretti stands on the sidewalk looking toward sonny inside the bank
sonny come out here a minute
at this point he removes his jacket and drops it to the ground showing sonny that he is unarmed
you got these cops outta here
theyre comin in too close
i want you to see something
you want me to give up huh
look sals in back with the girls
anything happens to me one move and sal gives it to them
how do i know you wont jump me
i dont forget about sal and the boom boom room
i want you to see this
sonny turns back to tell sal hes going outside
moretti stands well out in the street to reassure sonny nobody is going to try to jump him
sonny stares around he nudges sylvia out ahead of him
as they edge into sight of the media across the street out in the light
youre on tv lady
god damn thing
straining against police lines this is where we begin to sense the size of the event
people are eating popsicles and ice cream
they are diverted and excited
sonny and sylvia begin to emerge catcalls and hoots of greeting
as he looks around and the impact of his situation really hits him hes not only totally surrounded hes an event
some of the crowd cheer him
an army of cops and guns all levelled on sonny
let sal come out take a look
what hope you got
quit while youre ahead
all you got is attempted robbery
well armed then
nobodys been hurt
release the hostages nobody is gonna worry over kidnapping charges the worst youre gonna get is five years you can be out in a year
sonny stares at him his face utterly blank
moretti stops stares back
deadpan when im bein fucked i like to be kissed a lot
bursting out who the fuck are you tryin to con me into some deal
youre a city cop wheres the fbi
this is a federal offense i got kidnapping armed robbery theyre gonna bury me
you know it you cant talk for them youre some flunky pig tryin to bullshit me
now god damn it get somebody in charge here to talk to me
calm down youre not
look at this look at him
gestures at the cops the wall of rifles and machine guns levelled on him
it is incredible and terrifying
continuing they wanna kill me so bad they can taste it
he takes a defiant step into the street
the crowd screams as they get their first view which is of sonny telling the cops off
they dont need to hear the words they can see it
blow off the front of the whole god damn bank
he holds his hands wide offering himself as a target to the hulking officer
to the tv if it wasnt for you guys theyd kill everybody and say it was me and sal
to moretti you tell em to put the guns down
i cant stand it
he means it
moretti gestures to the officers to back away lower the guns
the crowd yells sonny has beat the cops
he is momentarily their hero
its a breaking point
moretti makes a decision
cop language command to put gun away all right put the guns down
he has to yell it twice before the cop slowly angrily stuffs the gun into his holster
sound the crowd screams
hearing the crowd applause
he turns and grins and waves to them
they scream more
he turns and waves to the media
theyve been yelling
hey over here
give us a wave
it is at this point that newsman leans out a window of the second floor of the bank quickly lowering a mike boom
sylvia sees this above her head
unhappy looking around at sheldon who shrugs
he did what he had to do
suddenly realizing what control he has enjoying it
he turns mockingly his left and his right profile to cameras
a fat woman runs heavily stumbling a delighted grin on her face up the stairs past camera yelling to someone unseen upstairs
turn on the tv turn the tv on you can see its him
small jammed with little things of sentimental value and cheap furniture clean but well worn
vi a small woman in her fifties with a perpetual smile and the sweating fat woman trot in just as vis husband a dour man in his fifties is exiting
i swear to god it looked just like him
he hesitates in the doorway as the two women rush to the tv which is already on the station showing live coverage of the bank robbery
on screen sonny can be seen ordering the cops around
moretti looks furious
as the recognizes sonny oh my god in heaven
the robber whose identity is not known came out of the bank with a hostage mrs
proud did i tell you
he looks good
whats he doin this for
he didnt tell me he needed money
he would of told me
ball is everyone all right in the bank
why rob a bank when you got a sucker for a mother
oh yeah the one girl was cryin but were havin a ball so far if just nobody shoots
why didnt he tell me
what about the man inside the bank
what is he doing
i just hope he gives the wrong name
he reaches for tv to turn it off
vi stops him
he never talks only goes sonny you want me to shoot that one this one
is that all there is that little bastard down there in the bank
ball do you think they might shoot if they get desperate
you got money for the subway
hey wait hes goin back in
she turns out of subway
its a special occasion take a cab for gods sake
sonny returning toward bank
as they shake hands
as sonny starts into the bank first he holds the door open waiting for sylvia
in the meantime the nd floor media man yells down to her
looking up toward them i gotta go now
youre out now
sonny waiting patiently holds door open for her
theyre my girls
they need me in there
and she walks through the door past sonny and into the bank
moretti yells up at the media to get the hell away and at the same time turns to a nearby cop and gives orders for the air conditioning to be
turned off inside the bank
as the crowd realizes what has happened they applaud and scream
at the door as sonny turns to grin and wave back at crowd
as sonny and sylvia walk into bank and head for the group at the rear
mulvaney is seated at his desk but the rest of the girls are standing around the vault area
sylvia heads for the girls as sonny walks toward sal
hey girls i was on television
to passing sonny what about howard
sonny makes reassuring gesture to let him know howard is safe
to mulvaney turn on the tv
mulvaney turns on the tv set
in the meantime sylvia has reached the other girls
and sylvia begins to recount the events out on the street mainly about herself as a television celebrity
as we see the image of a tv newsman across the street
then as his director cuts we will see on the tv set an the tv cameraman zooms and the tv image zeroes in through the door to show a partially
screened but quite clear image of sonny talking to sal
to sal the whole media is out there
it looks a lot better for us than it did before
we can see the robbers inside the bank and were trying now to establish contact
were on the telephone to the bank manager patrick j
mulvaney answers the phone
yes i can hear you
serious nodding to sal
can you put the robber on the phone
will he talk to us
you wanna talk to him
sonny turns trying to understand
they want to talk to you
he holds out the phone
sonny walks over to him and takes the receiver
on the tv screen we can see him doing this
into phone yeah

i wonder if youd answer a few questions
to sal hey sal
to phone sure
why are you doing this

jenny now edges over and sits on top of ednas desk
but i mean why do you need to steal

to join the union you gotta get the job but you dont get the job without the card

they pay one hundred thirty five dollars and thirty seven cents to start

then talk about somethin you fuckin know about
at that instant the tv screen switches to a please stand by card and we hear an announcers voice over ladies and gentlemen our transmission has been temporarily interrupted
please stand by
sonny hangs up the phone looks at mulvaney puzzled at the outcome of the conversation
why the hell did he do that
what the hell did i do
i guess he didnt appreciate your use of language
they dont speak that way on television
its a rule
do you realize youve cut off a valuable source of communication
sonny now moves over to sal
what do we do
no answer i figure maybe we can get the fbi to make a deal
what kind of a deal
maybe we can get outta this thing alive
get em to drop the kidnapping charges
what do you mean

starts to speak but sal interrupts because if youre talking about coppin a plea im tellin you right now theres no deal

you and me and jackie that night in the bar
we were talkin about if we get trapped in the bank what are you gonna do
what did we say
what did we say

sonny now walks over to the ringing phone on ednas desk
jenny sitting on top of the desk thinks the call is from her husband starts to reach for it but as she does sonny grabs it away from her
youre on the phone
kill them all
its a heavy adhesive voice that can be heard clearly throughout the bank
kill them all now
you fuckin creep

sonny slams down the receiver looks around at the group
you see what were dealing with
they want me to kill all of you
what now sonny
wait a minute
ive been looking at this all wrong
lets look at it the other way
he crosses over to sal
look we gotta get a jet outta here

we get a helicopter on the roof to take us to the jet and we fly to the sunny caribbean
we got to look at the bright side
we got em by the balls we got the hostages we can get anything we want

edna exits ladies room as sonny crosses back to the phone picks it up
into phone get me moretti
now sonny turns and speaks to the group

youre all gonna be all right

and were gonna get outta here alive
youve all been all right with me and as long as it stays that way then things are gonna be all right as long as you cooperate

sonny slams the phone down and walks over to sal rifle still in his hands
you realize sal that were gonna get outta the country so if you wanna talk to somebody do it now
you gotta mother or a father
sal nods no if we gotta be outside the country where do you wanna go
just name a country
stopped for a moment wyoming
thats not out of the country thats in the united states
look ill be back
sonny starts to walk toward the door
as he does sal calls back to him
gimme the gun
you dont need that
sonny realizes what hes saying and crosses back to sal and hands him the gun then moves toward the front door
much as before
sonny steps out
the guns start to come up
put them down
the cops lower their weapons
moretti comes out on the sidewalk
hes eating an ice cream bar and stands seemingly at ease an island of calm control in a storm of passion about to be let loose
the cops are always about to explode
sonny ya want somethin
sonny is about to open his mouth when a medium size dark haired man who has been standing among people behind the barriers puts his head down and runs at
astonishing speed right across the street towards sonny
he catches everybody so by surprise he is already on sonny before anyone can do more than start to yell at him to stop
sonny himself cant believe it
he is slammed to the ground and the man begins to punch him and beat him viciously
cops charge in and with great difficulty pull him off
yelling on the radio network tv reporters and the crowd up and screaming for blood
as moretti steps in
sonny gets up dazed
the man goes on kicking and fighting cops
who the hell is that
mulvaney stands in the door
to marias boy friend hey
what the fuck you tryin to do
you dont think the whole police department can do the job
i think hes got maria in there and i see blood man

from door alarmed sal wants to see sonny
he says hell shoot unless he can see sonny
he means sal
sonny dazed and bleeding reels to the door and calls in
sal now stands alone behind rd pillar
its okay sal
he turns back to face moretti sylvia mulvaney
continuing hurt wondering he wanted to kill me
its okay you got a lot of protection
looking around bewildered the crowd is yelling and now it sounds unfriendly
he is really shaken up
he shakes himself stops that line and starts over in a business like tone
i want a helicopter to get outa here
and a jet to take us to
cagey wherever we want to go
outa the country so no little jets
a big one with a bar and a piano lounge
i dont know sonny
i dont know if the helicopters can land in here
ill have to check it out
i got superiors unnerstan
they dont always see eye to eye with me
ill do what i can
sonny looks him in the eye
suddenly he makes kissing motions and sounds with his lips
we know what hes referring to he thinks morettis trying to fuck him over
continuing sonny be reasonable
i want to see my wife
i want you to bring her down here
okay what do you give me
what do you want
the girl hostages
i give you one hostage when you bring my wife and one for the helicopter one for the jet and the rest can come home on the jet
kiss ill see what theyll do
sonny smiles and pantomimes kissing
okay you pick out who youre gonna give us
wheres your wife
her body lies exactly as before baking in the sun
the transistor radio plays
she seems to be asleep
the leader of the pair a vietnam veteran sonny abramowicz has demanded in return for releasing one of the hostages that police allow his wife to visit him at the
heidi sits bolt upright stares at the radio which continues to blather on
abruptly she begins to gather up her things her children in a characteristically scatter brained and hyperactive sort of way
heidi is a one woman panic she hustles away across the broiling sand carrying the radio wadded up in towels and lugging a child crying helplessly by one elbow as
though it were a handle a silhouette against the late afternoon sun out of fellini
meanwhile on the sound track we are hearing her voice
it is a breathless harsh childish voice that pours out the words in a torrent the transistor goes sonny what
i couldnt believe my ears so i shut the transistor get outta here who needs this
i say sonny didnt do it
its not him to rob a bank
its not him to hurt anybody to threaten anybody to steal or do anything wrong
cause hes never done nothin wrong from the day i know him
she is stumping off into the sunset as she says these words and we out of a subway crowd she struggles pulling the two kids by the hand a very
ordinary woman in a most ordinary new york scene
only he tells me this and he tells me that hes with the mafia i say sonny where do you get the money youre on welfare how can you rent
a new eldorado red you dont like the color you rent a yellow
a working class block dirty shops in the first floor three story walk ups above
heidi appears and runs up the stoop
two cops get out of a squad car where theyve been staked out and move up to her
they never really get in a word edgewise
they follow her into the hall
now as we cut closer to her we will see heidis mouth in sync with the words
so night before last were at coney island hes on the rides with the kids an i have this habit of goin in glove compartments an all an i see
heidi struggles up the stairs dragging the kids the cops following
this gun with bullets in there an i go to myself oh god sonny
thats all i had to see i didnt say anything
shes got her door unlocked
below and on the stairs behind the cops curious neighbors peer in
chaos out of cut rate furniture stores
full of unwashed glasses kids clutter
throughout the children rush around unchecked
neighbors enter without ceremony and listen
the cops stand trying vainly to communicate
as they enter
continuing and things are adding in my head how crazy hes been acting and in with a bad crowd an i look at him hes yellin at the kids like
so inna car i said to him sonny what you gonna do with the gun
you gonna shoot me and dump my body inna river or what
i was so scared of him i never been scared of sonny never
you know his mother says the cops was always at our house we was always fighting
i hit him with the jack in the car once but i only missed and hit myself you should of seen my leg
and all he would ever do is put on his coat and go out
so they say its sonny but i dont believe it
lady you saw him
you saw his gun
he might of done it his body functions might of done it but not he himself
the group is now situated like this mulvaneys desk the tv is on seated in his chair filing her nails is miriam
seated to her left having pulled the chair a patron uses is maria watching tv and listening to her transistor radio against her left ear at the same time
mulvaney at back water cooler will eventually move back to his desk sit down to miriams right
edna is now behind the tellers cages straightening up the mess she picks up the loose money that sonny had scattered thru the air puts them into packets and ties
them with rubber bands
sal is seated in the rear conference room still holding his rifle feet up on the table
mulvaney deborah at the rear water cooler from which she will move to see whats wrong with margaret margaret seated at her desk obviously ill wiping her forehead head bowed
sylvia and jenny at far right table doing a crossword puzzle
sonny pacing back and forth mulvaneys desk posing a legal puzzle for maria
sonny his gun now lying across the top of mulvaneys desk is pacing back and forth between the desk areas
hes talking to maria in particular but anyone in earshot in general
lets say i put a gun to your head and i tell you to kill a cop
and you did
whod go to the electric chair
you or me
you told me to do it
but you shot him
joining in but you told her to
yeah but you did it
deborah crosses to margaret who is ill
deborah goes to sylvia who returns with her her to margaret
it should begin getting dark in through here
it is very hot and sweaty in the bank
open scene on he is sweating worried
he is listening to a conversation we can hear
as it goes on shot widens to reveal the others in various postures of waiting
sal more disheveled sonnys restlessness is unabated he paces about like a caged animal
the voice on the phone is breathy and youthful sonny has been listening for a long time
jesus christ is coming back and hes really pissed
gently yeah well i dont blame him
you know sonny i used to dope a lot and i was into dipping
and i did a couple bank jobs and the lord jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me you know how
sonny is desperate to get off the phone but doesnt dare risk the wrath of god by hanging up on this guy
he might have the secret after all
look were kind of
thats why i can talk to you as an equal sonny
you got to merge your whole soul with god
and then you are him and one with the holy ghost
maybe you better talk to one of these others okay
dont send me away
i can help you save your soul
sonny hangs up
deborah moves to margaret who is ill
she goes to tell sylvia who immediately crosses to margaret
the air conditioning is off or something
looks at margaret shes sick
sonny runs around notices her sees that air conditioner is off
wheres the air conditioning
i dont know sonny
on the roof somewhere i guess
about going out back to find the air conditioning mechanism sonny moves toward sal in the conference room
mulvaney follows discreetly behind him
sal im gonna take a look at the air conditioning
sonny and mulvaney start to move out toward the back door area
to mulvaney do you think we can turn it on
i dont know
at this point sal calls out to sonny and gets up to move to him
i never been up in a plane before
its nothing it just goes up its the safest thing in the world
safer than a car
dont worry about it sal itll be all right
and sonny and mulvaney exit toward rear of bank
sonny and mulvaney move toward the back door and stop under a trap door in the ceiling
mulvaney looks up at it
its gonna be up there
as sonny is staring up at the trap door thinking about what to do he hears a tiny scratching sound
sonny tensing like an animal peers around wildly to locate the source of the little scratching sound like mice at a steel door
who quickly runs back toward the desk area
sonny races back in grabs the gun from atop mulvaneys desk and with the cartridge in the other hand runs back toward the back door again jamming cartridge into rifle
at this point sal runs in from the conference room covering everyone point blank again yelling for edna to join the rest of the group
whispering theyre trying to come through the door
to edna everybody
edna quickly obeys moving quickly to the rest of the group
as sonny races toward mulvaney and back door with gun
somebody or something is working on the other side of the door
as he moves back from the door turns and levels the rifle on the back door
sonny if you shoot shoot high
my cars parked out there
staring at the door
he hears the continued scratching noise and might even see the door knob move
abruptly he swings the rifle up so the bullet going through will clearly go over the head of any man out through the transom
they all scream some of them falling to the floor huddling together in terror
sonny races back into main area where sal covers group
to group get over here
get over here
a knot of half a dozen police are working at the door
two were trying to work tubes under it to pump in gas others were trying a nylon line to the doorknob the idea being that if sonny came out that
way the moment he began to open the door the cops would yank it open exposing him completely and gun him down
the cops scream as the shot comes through the door showering them with brick fragments
they scramble over cars over each other over fences running into other cops who also not knowing whats happening turn and flee running into the crowd which panics
on men women children cops detectives dogs cats reporters all in the area of the rear of the bank fleeing in waves over fences cars etc
a flood of people like lemmings
this is intercut by margaret fainting
sal herds group into vault area
sonny dashing back and forth into rear bank area
moretti sheldon others come charging out wondering what the hell pulling guns out
the cops safely distanced and back in cover peek out at it is okay
he shot through the door
is he coming out
can you see in
reaches out his hand for a bullhorn that is thrust into it immediately
on bullhorn sonny
a few louts in the crowd yell out in imitation sonny
moretti shrugs off his irritation and raises the bullhorn one more time the crowd is ready and screams in unison as moretti says sonny
you could hear it for a half a mile
sonny starts to yell at moretti
inside bank what the hell you doin back there
sonny come on out
sonny walks over to sal gives him the rifle

i got some hungry people in there
i want to get some pizza

cokes seven ups
moretti repeats also some aspirin

turns behind him to a near by cop charlie
sonny turns and walks back into the bank
as sonny enters and walks toward sal
all right sal its okay
i got everything straightened out

look i talked to him and its not going to be a helicopter they cant land on top of the roof so theyre comin with a big
limousine bus and theyll take us to the airport and theyre gonna get a jet

i also ordered some food
i got some pizzas for us all right
i got some things to drink i got sodas
i even asked them for aspirins
im doin what i can
now i gotta pay for the pizza
where are the marked bills
he now walks behind tellers cages and picks up some of the decoy money that edna had started to clean up and re stack
mulvaney walks over to him
are we going to get the ball rolling
what are you talking about
what do you think im doin
im gettin the ball rollin
im keeping these people happy
im keeping you happy
i gotta keep the cops cooled out

sonny walks to the front door with the money
as sonny appears in it
guarded by a couple of cops
you the guy wanted the pizza
sonny grabs bills from the wad he holds and thrusts them at him
its paid for
looks at moretti moretti nods keep the change
as the cops reach for the money knowing its bank money people in the crowd yell hey over here
how about a thousand
throw some over here
hey no shit i need an operation i dont even have a job
sonny holds up the money
the crowd cheers
he throws the wad of bills and it scatters in the air
the wind is blowing now
even some cops join the ensuing melee to gather it up
as cops move forward and try to catch the bills
some blow into the crowd
fights break out in the crowd as they scramble for the money
the crowd breaks the barriers and swarms after the cash
cops try to retrieve bills fist fights arrests
staring at the mess
sonny also watching the people
there is in both of them the same reaction of faint disgust at the greed unleashed
sonny angrily hurls another bundle after the first
then laughs as he watches the people fighting
moretti nods ironically at him
sonny turns and enters the bank with the food
the fighting goes on in the street
as sonny enters carrying food
he puts it down in front of mulvaney on mulvaneys desk
mulvaney looks at it sickly
as mulvaney looks up at sonny you eat it first
i dont know if they put something in it
moretti sheldon other top cops march fast time toward the barrier where uniformed cops stand around a limousine that has drawn up to the barrier
it is full of white haired officials one of them the commissioner
he has a voice broken by whiskey cigars good food and yelling at football games
it looks like they may be going into action
morettis attitude is not that subtly different now hes talking to brass
commissioner doesnt get out he talks through window
the commissioners hand pudgy and freckled with age covers morettis where it rests on the door he massages morettis hand fondly
gene you smilin
i never smile any more
whattaya think we gonna kill any civilians tonight gene
i never make bets or guesses that way im never wrong and i never have to pay out
gene jesus what a bull he is
a lot of comfortable chuckles inside the limo
the commissioners hand lingers on morettis they are fond of each other these men linked in a relationship of a lifetime of shared experience of attitudes of maleness an accumulation
of years of jokes about being late for dinner of women waiting and women panting with desire men secure in the bastion of their roles
what is being passed on here is a purely emotional force of approval and acceptance from top to bottom of a social institution that is the last totally masculine society
the homosexual content of this should not be lost it lies in the comfortable fit of their feelings in the fact simply that they love each other for what they
so whatsa deal
they jets comin out
but dont let em off the ground
what if we gotta kill a whole lot of people
dont let em off the ground
he leans down to get close to his commissioner because hes not fooled by the camaraderie into a false sense of security
anticipating if youre right im gonna back you a hundred percent you know that
pleasantly fuck you sir if im right i dont need you
what i want is if i make an honest mistake i want help
the commissioner nods presses a button and the window goes up to keep the air conditioning in and the heat out
as we hear jenny on the phone with her husband
sonny is doing the manual of arms with his rifle
well just pick him up and hold him
no hes not spoiled hes just got to settle his stomach after eating
hes used to me feeding me thats all
at one point sonny starts to show miriam how to hold the gun and in mock seriousness she tries to do the manual of arms
where sal is seated at the conference table rifle on the table
edna and sylvia are also seated there
somebody give me a cigarette
maria walks over to her offering her one then remembers sylvia you dont smoke
i never smoked before in my life but i got a right to start now if i want to
you dont smoke
why do you want to start now
because im scared thats why
you never smoked
i used to but i stopped
because i dont want cancer
you dont want cancer
youre about to get your head blown off youre worried about cancer
to maria gimme the cigarette
maria starts to hand one to her
im not kidding

staring at him youre serious

you know you remind me of my year old brother only hes got his hair down to his knees he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of
god forbid i should say something to him like listen if you ever smoke marijuana just remember that its illegal and he storms outta the house
you rob a bank but you keep your body pure is that it
you gonna smoke the cigarette
sal gets up and starts to leave the room
calling to him sal
if i die of cancer its going to be half your fault
sylvia grabs the cigarette from maria
exiting no its because youre weak
sonny continues with manual of arms business with rifle
mulvaney is on the phone
overlapping janet into phone mulvaney
listens into phone i dont know
to sonny its for you
sonny takes the phone
were bringing in your wife
he comes alert looks around at sal nods and starts for the door of the bank turns to sal
gives him gun theyve got my wife
theyre bringing her in
he exits bank
sal walks toward the door stops behind the first post
the fire escape with the old lady and her jigsaw puzzle the flak vested snipers etc
below in the street a police car plows through the crowd with red lights flashing but no sirens or perhaps just a low growl to help move the human sea
people are leaning over trying to see inside
moretti and sheldon and staff move out into the street
the cop car is moving through police lines cops lifting barricades aside to let it pass
with moretti and others as they move to intercept the police car where it will stop on the corner
as they stop we can see sonny step into the door of the bank in the distance
he is greeted with cheers from the crowd
but is intent on the car
we are now shooting across the car over morettis back toward the bank and sonny
the driver of the police car gets out with a huge grin on his face and nods to moretti
the back door opens and another cop gets out also grinning
they look around toward sonny as his wife gets out of the police car on this side
she is spectacularly good looking in a lithe cruel sort of way like lauren bacall but right now she is a mess
as sonny sees leon get out of the car
happy birthday leon
who doesnt hear sonny calling the detectives and moretti start to take him to the barbershop
to cop driver whats that
we went to the hospital where he told us and asked for his wife
indicates leon says they got married in a church
they continue along the sidewalk
leon coming to starts to look around him
he sees sonny
as he yells again to leon
the crowd yelling in increasing waves of sound moretti and cops pick up leon and rush him toward the barbershop
who dashes toward the bank door enters
as sonny comes running in
sylvia is now showing off her new found expertise with a cigarette to miriam jenny and deborah seated around ednas desk
deborah is talking on the phone
meanwhile edna is back in the conference room with mulvaney margaret is seated at her desk speaking on the phone maria speaking on phone is seated at mulvaneys desk where
television is still on
sonny wanting to use a phone realizes that all are in use rushes to a desk at the front of the bank
sal follows him there
sonny grabs a phone
into phone get me moretti
where moretti and cops are trying to revive leon
a cop at the phone turns to moretti
moretti he wants to talk to you
moretti walks over to phone takes receiver from cop
sonny waiting for moretti to answer phone
is he all right
is he all right
hes all doped up
i want to talk to him
hes groggy sonny
let me get him on his feet and hell call you back
hangs up as moretti hangs up phone and walks over to leon who now has a glass of water and a cold towel
they give you a shot down the hospital or what
oh god they shot me with like unreal
well you got to get hold of yourself
you got to talk to him tell him to give himself up
hes got eight people in there with him
hes got this kid with him

if he wont listen to you who will he listen to
he wont listen to anybody
hes been very crazy all summer

what good is that
they couldnt stop him
and itd just make him mad
they dont know him
somebodys got to stop him leon
he was under great strain you dont understand hes a very mixed up person
hes makin threats in there
i never met anyone like him
his wife hes a wonderful father to his children
his mother you should see her his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck he lets it all slide off his back he sees them he pays
i wanted to get married
he didnt really want it
hes married already
but he did it
i dont know why
i thought it would help me but it didnt
i was just as confused and unhappy was before i did terrible things
what kind of things leon
ten days i spent in atlantic city sonny was frantic he knew i was drinking he didnt know where i was
who i was with
i couldnt explain why i did the things i did
so i went to this psychiatrist who explained to me i was a woman in a mans body
so sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation but where was he to get that
my god hes in hock up to his ears already
he needed money
for the operation for you
it made him crazy so much demand hed fly into this rages
and i got more depressed than ever i saw id never get the operation
so i tried to take my life i swallowed about a half pound of pills
blues reds yellows downers uppers screamers
you name it
but i just threw them up and wound up in the hospital
sonny comes there and looks at me and just says wow
so when i hear hes in the bank i almost go crazy because i know hes doin it for me
well dont you figure you owe to him to get him out of there
i cant talk to him
youre in it up to your ass leon
youre an accessory
you talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case
how is he gonna hurt you on the telephone
i dont know what to say to him
you think it over leon
moretti walks over to the wall phone picks up the receiver and waits to be connected with the bank and sonny
he really cant do it
as the phone rings
sonny picks it up hears morettis voice
he wont talk to you
let me work on it
sonny hangs up
he and sal walk toward the group at the rear around the desks
as we see tv newsman speaking
police are questioning leon a year old admitted homosexual who claims to have been married to one of the bank robbers in a ceremony last november
during the speech sylvia and her group wander toward mulvaneys desk to listen as edna wanders down from the conference room crosses to the set and turns up the volume
pacing back and forth
they all stare at him
slowly the group shifts to other positions without a word being said
our coverage of the brooklyn robbery where two homosexuals are holding hostages for their demands of a helicopter a jet and safe passage out of the country
sonny you hear that
they keep sayin two homosexuals
im not a homosexual
i want you to stop them saying that
thats all theyre interested in its a freak show to them
i cant control it sal letem say what they want
it dont matter
wheres the god damn jet
theyre always flying overhead going somewhere
fbi snipers area at positions waiting
a small group of men make a last check
a signal is given
they get in their car and drive away
an fbi sniper lights a cigarette and settles down to wait moving his rifle to a comfortable position
the old lady dozes over her puzzle
the police agents are being relieved
light floods the front of the bank
sonny paces back and forth with ad lib dialogue to group
margaret seated at her desk has feet up on another chair while jenny sits on top of her desk
mulvaney is back at water cooler starting to feel very ill
miriam and deborah are seated at mulvaneys desk
edna is seated at her desk while sylvia sits on top of desk talking on phone
suddenly the lights go out leaving only emergency lights on in the main area and at back door area
sylvia immediately moves over toward the vault area and turns on hand lamps
thats it sonny
both rush toward the front of the bank
they see that even the flood lights are now out but across the street can still be seen lights in the store windows
sonny rushes to a near by phone to try to reach moretti but even the phones are dead
they hear morettis voice over a bull horn outside sonny
come out a minute
come out a minute
sonny moves toward the front door
moretti and sheldon are in the barbershop
were all set at kennedy
what makes you think youll be able to control it
hes totally unstable
hell make a mistake
he hasnt so far
im the one who can make a mistake
thats what scares the shit out of me
eugene at this became federal
why dont i take it over now
as the door opens and sonny peeks out the once illuminating floodlights now out
what the fuck is goin on
theres no answer
sonny steps out into the street
he cant see anything anymore
the atmosphere is suddenly chillingly dangerous the crowd shots come out of the dark and we cant see from here
the street seems empty except for a few threatening silhouettes of heavily armed cops
sonny responds with bluster
get the lights back on
he steps out farther into the street
from behind him sheldon the fbi man approaches
he is alone
sonny dashes back into the bank
as sonny rushes in warns sal about the fbi confrontation hes about to have
sal its the fbi
im goin back out to talk to him
at this he walks back toward the door and exits the bank again
sheldon is walking toward sonny as the latter exits the bank
what is this
jesus now were talkin maybe we can get this thing moving
as sheldon reaches him
first off get the lights back on and the air conditioning
showing id no more favors
thats all over sonny
sarcastically aw jesus
you been doin us favors all night
ive got a jet
ill have airport limousine here in a half hour
i want the hostages

sonny comes around looking for moretti cant see him
well jesus these hostages are keeping me alive
okay when do i get them

we get on the plane check it out and if its all okay well send them out
i want them all
i want to talk to leon
pause while sheldon thinks this over
i want to come in and see if everybodys okay
you got guts
you think if sal and me have cut their throats were gonna let you out
i have to see
sonny re enters bank
sonny goes over to sal
its the fbi
he wants to come in
have him walk in backwards
sonny exits bank
sonny crosses to sheldon grins grabs him and executes a very professional looking pat down search
he removes sheldons
from a shoulder holster producing it for the crowd with a flourish like a magician some of the old playfulness returns for a moment
he carefully and with showbiz flourishes searches sheldons thighs and groin
the crowd howls
sheldon bears it with stoic calm
as sonny stands up from the search and finds sheldons eyes locked to his with flat calm
jesus youd like to kill me too
i wouldnt like to but i will if i have to
nothin personal huh
the man that kills me i want him to do it because he hates my guts
not because its a job
okay lets go
but you gotta walk in backwards
the move toward the door of the bank where sonny opens the door preceding sheldon both men entering backwards
except for the emergency lights it is very dark and very hot as sonny and sheldon enter the bank
sal now stands behind the desks covering sheldon and the group assembled at the vault
sheldon takes in every detail as he walks toward the group in the rear followed closely and covered by sonny
as they near the desks sonny yells out an order for the group nobody give their right name
its the fbi
i just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here
listen we asked for the jet hours ago what are you doin out there
sheldon is watching sal trying to gauge him
this is the first time anyone from outside has seen sal
his eyes on sal its all being set up well have you out of here in a couple of hours
to sheldon just give them what they want
sheldon now walks closer to group looking into the two small examining rooms as he moves
sonny covers him every inch of the way
theyre getting what they want
we just want to be sure we get what we want which is to get all you ladies out safe
and you two boys too
sheldon is now standing very close to sal
to sheldon you got to talk to the tv tell them to stop talking about the two homosexuals
im not gay
thats the truth
tell em that
he turns to sonny sonny
outside for a minute
they gotta stop sayin that
as they sheldon and sonny exit and stand in the doorway out of earshot of the others
sheldon is matter of fact but insinuating and conspiratorial
sonny you handled yourself real well
a lot of men would have choked and wed have a lot of chaos and panic and maybe a death or a multiple death on our hands but you handled
i respect that
dont you try to take sal
well handle him
you just sit tight and you wont get hurt
he starts to go
sonny grabs him
wait a minute
what the fuck you tryin to tell me
quiet what i said
you just sit quiet and well handle sal
and he turns and starts to walk away leaving sonny staring after him
as sheldon steps into the door
the place is jammed moretti stands inside the door where sonny could not have possibly seen him
sheldon quietly turns and stands beside him both men looking back across the street
the little bastard miss me
sheldon smiles the supercilious ehrlichman smile of his
as sonny re enters
hes restless hyperactive constantly moving during this scene a man with a potentially guilty conscience
sal moves toward him and both men walk to area in front of the tellers cages
whatd he say
he was talkin about arrangements
we were talkin about the tv
why couldnt he talk about that here
he was showin me how the airport bus is comin in like that sal
notices mulvaney start to faint whats wrong with him
in the rear mulvaney slumps into a chair beside margarets desk
sylvia rushes to help him untying his tie etc
maria runs into the conference room hoping to find remains of sugar as deborah crosses to his desk looking through the drawers for medication
jenny simply cant cope with it and walks away
hey you okay
hes got diabetes
hes not a well person
those bastards they poisoned the pizza
sal you didnt eat any pizza
i didnt eat any pizza
i told you hes got diabetes
youre supposed to balance your sugar diet right
sonny starts to move toward the front door
sonny rushes outside
is there a doctor over there
get him over here
come on on the double
sheldon and a young doctor appear concerned
the manager hes diabetic hes lookin bad
sheldon turns calls out
a man comes forward is frisked by sonny who then dumps contents of his black bag and looks for weapons
sonny then dashes inside bank
as sonny comes in walks over to sal
sal the doctors coming in
sonny then rushes back outside bank again
sonny crosses to doctor
to doctor you go on in
the doctor hustles past
hold on sheldon
picks up the phone ive convinced leon to talk to you

sonny rushes back into bank
sonny rushes in
the phone rings

listen its late already when i realize its not just a couple of ordinary faggots its just you and sal
i couldnt get a baby sitter
heidi goes on and on but sonny just drops the phone on the hook
as he walks toward the rear of the bank sylvia seated atop margarets desk gets off and follows sonny toward the conference room
at the same time edna is lifting margarets feet up onto a chair and jenny and deborah start to walk toward the conference room too
maria paces back and forth transistor to her ear
sonny walks into the conference room
the doctor is through examining mulvaney
miriam is seated across the table from him
listen i think i better take him back for a cardiac check
mulvaney waves protesting
hes had a shot hes rapidly recovering
is he gonna die
no i just think
you know more than the doctor
youre not okay look at you
to doctor lets get him out
im not going
as sonny grabs him to try to help him up mulvaney wrenches away
a little physical here
im tryin to help you
i stay here
i just needed the insulin
im used to it
to doctor you tell me
is he endangering his health because if you tell me he is ill get him out
ill be god damned if you will
you want to be a martyr or a hero or what
maria and miriam dance to transistors music
edna walks into conference room to tidy up
sal is still sitting there
deborah tries to comfort jenny
i dont wanta be either i just want to be left alone
you understand that
i wish the fuck you never came in my bank thats all dont try to act like youre some angel of human kindness
he crosses toward tellers cages to start straightening up sonny nods staring at him
as doctor moves toward front door sonny walks with him
grabs marked bills and stuffs them into the doctors pocket
here my man
whattayou get for a house call
as doctor tries to wave it away continuing no no
i want a top specialist for my friend i expect to pay top money
hes hustled him to the door where he ushers him out door
hastily made about feet long being raised above the heads of crowd to where sonny can see it
we cant read it until its all the way up
then is reads as the crowd reads it fist fights break out and it totters and staggers but the defenders fight bravely
they are ordinary looking people not freaks
looking at it at them with mixed feelings
standing across the street looking at him
sheldon indicates his watch
holds up ten fingers ten minutes
he turns into the bank
sonny comes back into bank his face mad with pain
he walks over to sylvia standing at open gate of tellers cages and brings out a wallet with pictures for her to see
she takes it smiles
kimmy and jimmy
she looks over toward mulvaney now behind the tellers cages trying to tidy up and walks over to show him the pictures
sonny stands on the other side of the cages
as mulvaney looks at pictures ill never see them again mister mulvaney
they look like good kids
theyre like any others but theyre special to me
you got kids
you told me you got two
special to me too
you like me
sure we like you
no you dont
you seem like a likable enough guy
its hard to judge
sonny walks back toward sal who is seated in conference room
how you doin
sonny crosses back downstage again to mulvaney and sylvia
referring to sal you know i dont know him very well but hes not gay
and hes not going back to prison
one time when he was in prison they gang banged him years old and eight guys gave it to him
so sal isnt goin back to prison no way
i like you people
i really do
we like you too
you know i had a job once
i used to work in a bank
i had been training
i used to have a boss
he wore a toupee
i wonder if youd hire me if i came in here and asked you for a job
would i hire you
grinning i dont think so
sonny walks back toward sal
i told you theyre sending a jet
its all worked out
but doubt hangs in the air like a pall
looking at him
this tension between them over the question of sonnys loyalty must be kept constantly alive with cuts and looks over dialogue
somebody give me another cigarette
sal turns to look at her reproachfully
i wish somebody would tell me im gonna live long enough for it to be a habit
my parent shell be okay
my husband hell be okay
i even know who the bum is gonna marry
shell take good care of him
girls i wanta apologize
for my language back there
embarrassed he walks toward the rest of group in the rear stands by ednas desk
i want to apologize for my language back there
he walks over to his desk sits down sonny exits conference room and moves downstage
amazed whatd you say
i didnt hear you say anything
they think for a moment
he said the f word
they stare at her incredulously
the f word
he said the f word
edna crosses to her desk disgusted and starts to tidy up
the giggle catches the edge of their panic and anxiety and sweeps them into uncontrollable giggles and laughter sonny roars
sal and edna alone remain unsmiling
after a few seconds they force themselves to stop to behave like they should under the circumstances
they are gasping and crying
whats so funny
well im a christian and my ears are not garbage cans
it sets them off again
they howl and giggle and laugh
until at last they run down again
at this point sal rushes out of conference room
he has seen something in the middle of the street and now
as they all turn to look out through the door
backlighted by the floodlights in the middle of street escorted by sheldon stands a figure dumpy and gray tentatively waving a figure that bends over baby carriages in the park
picks beans one by one out of supermarket bins lip reads get well cards in pharmacies
they hear sheldon outside on bullhorn sonny
could you come out please
could you come out please
its my mother
who needs this shit
but as a dutiful son he starts for the front of the bank
as sonny walks to his mother
baker tactfully moves away leaving the two of them in the center of the floodlighted street
again the crowd can be heard but not seen armed police fringe the lights and shadows in b
what do you want here ma
you could of watched it on tv
my god sonny you oughtta see alla brooklyn is here
on all networks
mom i got it all worked out its over
the best thing is you go home

he was very understanding you ought to talk to him
we cant stay here
oh my god

if you needed money why couldnt you come to me
everything i got is yours
i got two hundred and maybe twenty five in the savings

sonny abruptly realizes he is getting sidetracked by mom like always
tries to get it back again
mom theyre sending a bus to take us to the airport
if youre here theyre not gonna send it
theyll think im gonna come out with you
whats wrong with that
the fbi was very understanding when i explained it to him
everybody knows it isnt you
its the pressures from your home life
for gods sake dont start in on heidi again
did i say a thing against her
god forbid i should say anything against that fat cunt
there are some things a mother shouldnt say in front of her son
if she comes down here so help me im gonna mash her brains in
everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her
since then forget it
she doesnt have anything to do with it
you understand that
this is me
i know you wouldnt need leon if heidi was treating you right
the thing i dont understand is why you come out and sleep with heidi anyway
you got two kids on welfare now

this is old stuff not now mom please

she thinks for a moment run
what the hell for
twenty five years in the pen
aw christ what dreams you live on
she stares at him
he talks slowly and carefully to her
im a fuckup and an outcast
there isnt one single person in my life i havent hurt through my love
you understand that
im the most dangerous person in the world because if i love you watch out youre gonna get fucked fucked over and fucked out
did pop come down
this really pissed him off sonny
he says youre dead
he says he doesnt have a son
you shoulda done what he did
embraces her dont talk to the fbi anymore
he walks away and moves toward the bank door
her desperate smile apologetic and false at the same time glistens with a mothers tears
after a long beat i remember how beautiful you were
as a baby you were so beautiful
we had such hopes
as sonny enters and stops controlling his emotions
he walks toward mulvaney who is putting visitors chair back into position then waters his plant
maria and miriam are still dancing margaret is at her desk sal jenny and deborah are in the conference room sylvia is still behind tellers cages
are you a lawyer
i had some legal training but
i want to dictate my will
i need a notary
im a notary
she leaves tellers cages area crosses to sonny grabbing a pen from ednas desk on the way
sonnys urgent mood reaches them
sylvia gets note pad from mulvaney
takes the dictation
being of sound mind and body and all that shit
sylvia nods got it
to my darling wife leon whom i love as no other man has loved another man in all eternity i leave from my life insurance policy to be used for
your sex change operation
if there is money left over it is to go to you on the first anniversary of my death at my grave
i expect you to be a real woman then and your life full of happiness and joy
to my sweet wife heidi five thousand from the same policy
you are the only woman i have ever loved and i re pledge my love to you in this sad moment and to little kimmy and jimmy

here ill spell the last name
he sits and writes it for sylvia
type that up and ill sign it
nobody says anything about this document
what is there to say
sylvia walks to her desk at the front of the bank near the window and begins typing
the restless crowd stirs sensing something happening
turning to see something coming
the cops gear up their weapons radios crackle
something a vehicle is moving through the crowd cops shoving people aside to let it through
the old lady pays no attention
she is down to one of the very last pieces of the puzzle and is searching for the spot for it
as the vehicle clears the crowd and slowly draws up in front
it is a long airport limousine of the type with many doors
everyones attention is on it
a black driver gets out a gay afro knit on his head coke dealers shades for the cognoscenti one very long little finger nail a nifty van dyke style beard
and one gold front tooth
he looks around holding a sheet of paper
sheldon others approach
they are looking into the vehicles opening doors checking tires etc
he strides to the limo
get away from it
after a moment the cops all move back
sonny opens the front door and begins to check it out
the driver starts to move away
these seats come out
together they remove the seat so sonny can check for guns concealed below etc
improvise to fit conditions of the car
dawning on him jesus youre the man
come on whats under this
they pry up a seat and look under etc
all through i was lookin at it
i saw you man
you oughta see yourself
you wouldnt believe it
yes i would
god damn it sheila isnt gonna believe it
they just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to address in brooklyn and i say shit another load of elks for the massage parlors
driver stands up getting a good look at sonny
well by god im gonna remember you
and he turns and walks away
driver stops uncertainly
cops grab him to hustle him away
sheldon steps forward with a neat twenty years younger carbon copy of himself
heres your driver this is agent murphy
sonny and murphy
sonny eyes murphy thinks then begins to frisk murphy
he finds nothing
he stands up and eyes murphy
he just doesnt like it
i dont want him
what can he do hes clean
gimme the black guy
the driver is still close enough to hear
overlapping everybody come on nobodys gonna get hurt
if they were gonna shoot theyd shoot now
i cant allow that sonny
you cant allow
im running this thing what gives you the idea you can say shit
to driver come on
ill pay you
whatta you want
the driver looks around desperately to the fbi to get him out of this
dont look at him
im running this
sheldon finally reluctantly nods
sonny motions for him the driver to step forward
before he can get in the car sonny stops him
signals to him to get ready
gives him a thorough pat search
thighs the whole bit
it is tense
the driver seems uptight
sonny finds nothing until he touches a breast pocket
the driver is very uptight
sonny reaches in pulls out a tiny bottle with a coke spoon chained to the lid
before sheldon can see it but the audience has sonny shoves it back grins slaps the driver on the buns
the driver laughs delightedly
he was afraid hed get busted for the dope the drive will be a cakewalk
youll be okay
to fbi you men shoot aim for the white meat
he loves the joke
they act as though they hadnt heard
sonny slaps him playfully on the arm and smiling turns to sheldon
i want him
he points at murphy
sheldon stands there speechless
driver stares at sonny his smile fading
delighted what do you think youre dealing with an idiot
sheldon nods to driver and murphy
murphy resumes role as driver of the limo
driver gets out
so long copper
as they position the stretchout in front of the bank
it can be seen from inside
the fbi men stand well back from it
murphy stands by the door
he also can be seen
you follow my car
sonny is satisfied and turns to the bank takes murphy into vestibule indicating for him to stay there
sonny continues toward group at rear
sylvia is finishing her typing
the girls and mulvaney are slowly getting ready
deborah is getting her purse out of margarets desk drawer margaret gathering her own purse books etc
jenny is getting her purse from ednas desk as edna gathers up her belongings mulvaney is seated at his desk miriam is at her desk by the front door
sal stands with his gun ready
as sonny enters and takes up his gun sal carefully and methodically begins to redress himself comb his rumpled hair knotting his tie carefully
as he rebuilds his sartorial image before the various reflecting surfaces of the bank knotting his tie in a glass partition checking his suit for wrinkles in a glass door
meanwhile we are seeing the following which sal ignores hey lets get ready
gets up walks to sonny sonny heres your document
looking at the will taking up pen
watching him with compassion
sonny signs fast and firmly
sylvias notary seal clamps and imprints the paper
okay okay okay
what a bunch of cold fish
its an adventure
everybodys gonna remember you the rest of your lives the day you got held up and kidnapped
his eye has struck some reminder
they handle this
you got bank americard
tired what now sonny
gathers money from near by money bag listen i owe a couple hundred dollars
i dont wanta leave owing anybody anything
a clean slate a new leaf
he plunks his card down before sylvia
continuing i paying off
money from attached case here
two hundred should do it
they start the action of filing the form and accepting the money
sonny stops them
just give me a receipt
hey sal you okay
deep in his hair or tie or
accepts receipt heres your document sonny
yeah it looks real official
they are ready
a moment in the dark
sonny holds out the will to mulvaney
hold it for me
mulvaney takes it
sonny shakes his hand
suddenly emotionally he embraces sylvia
suddenly they are all saying silent goodbyes
shaking hands all around formally
only sal is left untouched standing apart watching them in the dark
everyone waits in silence
the driver waiting in the drivers seat
after a beat the door begins to open
as cops guns are brought to bear
on the apartment fire escape the old lady is asleep her puzzle complete
the snipers raise their rifles
sheldon stands there
the police radio network crackles theyre coming out
perpetrators and hostages together
only authorized personnel may previously authorized and etc
sheldons eyes go to a middle aged man who looks like an overweight accountant in flak vest and helmet that seems too small aiming through a telescopic sight at letting
murphy out first yells outside get away from the car
something that looks like a multi legged animal emerges
it is sonny and sal in the center of a tight group of the girls and mulvaney so they are completely protected on all sides by hostages
over their heads is thrown some drapes from the bank that further prevent the police from drawing a clear head on sonny or sal without hitting a girl
in fact they cant be seen at all
this weird apparition appears hesitates
the crowd yells shoot
choreograph the action so the group hesitates takes a step forward then its clear sonny cant see well enough to go direct to the car and the girls are uncertain
which direction to go in not having been briefed
so they stumble about make false starts and finally arrive at the car where one girl gets into the second row of seats behind the driver
then sonny slides across next to driver
the police have no chance to shoot
the group looks like a bewildered centipede finding its way
mulvaney detaches himself from the group and slips into the front seat on sonnys right
standing alone outside filled up limo
sheldon walks over to mulvaneys window
to sheldon okay you got your one
to murphy you follow my car
he moves off maria gets in the rear most row of seats
sal next to her in the middle and then another girl
one woman edna a plain middle aged woman who has not said a word until now is left over
she stands by the side of the limo as the doors close and this phase of the operation ends without mishap
we did it
to edna goodbye honey
wish us luck
edna pecks out dry little kisses to the nearest girls
as edna pecks
ill be a son of a bitch were all okay
honk the horn
sal has his gun pointed on back of drivers head
hey sal do me a favor
point that gun up huh
we hit a bump and the fuckin gunll go off
the driver honks the horn theyre ready
the crowd screams
cops keep jockeying for position but there is no way to get a shot in
he steps into his car a police car pulls up behind and the procession starts to pull slowly toward the crowd
as the limo pulls away she is bewildered by the rush of police bank people fbi men who stream past her ignoring her all pouring into the bank
tv crews move by and finally one stops to interview her
being rammed through the jam of cops and screaming people trying to get a last look
the hostages looking out wan worried
sonny and sal inside alert ready with guns
sal please keep that gun pointed up huh
from inside the limo
the faces of the poor the excited the vicious the curious and in one shot some of the people from the gay liberation movement carrying hastily lettered signs one protesting
sonny and another their scared and wan faces swim past in the mob
sonnys mother is briefly seen looking out of the barber shop window alone and forgotten
the cops stare heavily sullen with anger
now the limo is moving faster
people are running alongside yelling insults trying to see in asking for hand outs but they are going faster
inside they say nothing
up ahead sheldons car flashes a red light
behind the police car does the same
as the procession moves through brooklyn
a helicopter follows above them
they move along followed by a honking parade of kibitzing cars like a mexican wedding
they turn onto the thruway trying to out distance the cars tagging along
sonny and sal hold their rifles ready between their knees
as they veer off the thruway a barely seen guard swings open a gate and they roar through
the guard pushes the gate to and the following caravan of cars brakes skids and a pile up of fender bender accidents begin cars going into the fence and each
cars are strewn all around
doors open and drivers leap out ready to yell and do battle
the cops guard the now closed gate
distant lights some moving
the fbi car the limo the following police car move across the darkness
they sit quiet following the fbi car
the fbi car stops
murphy can you see what theyre doing
hes still got some arrangements to make
sheldon is getting out of the car up ahead
sonny and sal and all of them come alert
as sheldon and the other fbi men get out of their car a pair of aircraft landing lights become visible taxiing towards the limo
there it is sal
how about food
i forgot to ask to have food on board
sheldon has been walking down to the limo
he stops beside mulvaney and knocks on the window
mulvaney rolls it down
thats the jet
you give us one more now
thats the deal
which one goes
there is silence inside the limo
mulvaney turns to sylvia
from a handkerchief sylvia draws a slip of paper
go on honey
they open the door
they urge her out and maria goes with a show of reluctance
as she stands up outside she is revealed to have a rosary shes counting
improvise goodbyes tearful and fearful all around
then i pray for your safety
meaning sonny and sal sal
because i know its your first plane trip
dont be scared you know
gives him her rosary and maria walks away
now the plane has taxied into position where it can be seen in floodlights
it looks big and impressive
we know the fbi has snipers ringing it
i aint eaten all day
i just realized it
well have hamburgers on the plane
turns to sal again sal keep it up huh
the gun please
looking at the plane grasping his money and his gun
the rifle stands straight up between his legs
sheldon leans down peering in at him
what do you think sal
you ready to go
in front of sonny behind mulvaney
for the first time he smiles
he realizes that escape is within their grasp
the smile transforms him from a formidable mafia imitation into an utterly sweet and defenseless youth
gun pointing high hey sonny you did it
lets move it goddamn it
to driver you ready to get out first
driver starts to turn in the drivers seat
sheldon brings up his hands to reach through the open window to grab sonnys rifle barrel pushes it away aiming out windshield
mulvaney sees them beginning their move and starts to duck
sal begins to see movement out of the corner of his eyes and is barely beginning to react
sonny sees it and sheldons hand grabbing the barrel of his gun at the same moment
sheldon drives hard into the side of the limo reaching in
mulvaney grabs the girl next to him and pulls her by the hair down toward the floor
sal open mouthed with amazement is a split second late bringing his gun up
driver completes his turn and has his gun leveled at sal between miriam and margaret in middle row
sheldon grabs his rifle barrel and pulls hard
sonny lets it go
sal stares at the gun barrel trying to get his gun up
mulvaney hits the floor
sheldon holds sonnys gun
sonny close watches
sal hit slams back into the seat the gun flies upward
another shot hits him flinging his head back
driver holds his third shot turns to sonny holds gun to his temple
sonny looks down so he can see fully as sals head snaps back for a split second and stares directly into sonnys eyes upside down
he stares sadly into sonnys eyes
as though he knew it all along betrayed
the shot is echoing
now screams yells slamming doors panic
sonnys voice shoot me
for gods sake shoot me
they come pouring out of the limo scrambling frantically away from it
the limo the people fleeing it
agents pull people away from the car
driver and sheldon and cops peer into the back
sals body lies slumped
driver sheldon other cops stand about recovering
no one makes the slightest sort of congratulatory move it was just another job
driver clears his weapon hands it to sheldon to be filed in case of investigation
they hug cry laugh jump up and down theyre alive
to mulvaney i been dying to do this for years
and she kisses him hard in the mouth
he laughs and kisses back
tears are beginning to flood past his defenses you are under arrest
you have the right to remain silent
you have the right to counsel to be present during your interrogation
his voice is dry as though he were reciting from memory something he learned in a language he doesnt understand
like a warhol interview on tv
segue voice track
well i dont see how sonny can survive in prison he was very loud very boisterous
he was obnoxious
being manipulated like so much beef by impersonal fbi agents
he was very hard to live with
he made me laugh
remnants of the crowd of sightseers being interviewed by tv men avid for more more more news
these are people among the group that held up the big banner earlier now we see them up close
theyre folding up their banner
a very ordinary looking young guy
i love him
he put an end to all that pansy limp wristed shit
theyre getting off his belt his shoe laces
because he always had a way of getting out always in the army he was awol
manacled and helpless
he is twisted into some yet more uncomfortable position by the uncaring agents
i cant help thinking how he might ring the bell one of these days
thats why im nervous because im always thinking some day hes gonna come along and ring the bell
through the shot sals body is carried sonny seeing it out of the corner of his eye
he tries to look
keep your eyes front
a faded rattled woman perhaps a little drunk
how did you know your son was involved
it was on the tv
when was the last time you saw sal
oh a long time
because i kept asking my husband where the heck could junior be
he wasnt around here
i thought maybe he was in prison or some place
did you know he was a homosexual
no not until after they killed him
did you always call him junior
do you remember anything else about sal
no thats all
sonny isnt even listening
he sees something o
the hostages moving toward a car to take them home are passing nearby and turn to look at him
you were terrific
they stare at him theyve already begun to forget him the moment in the bank when they said their goodbyes is already receding from their consciousness
their smiles are forced and they dont really know what to say
good luck you know
you were terrific too
and as the first welcome drops of cooling rain fall they begin to move fast
looking after them
the rain hitting his face
the adventure is over
but the everlasting smile overtakes him
life is easier with him in prison
it would be like always the bell would ring wed have a ball
