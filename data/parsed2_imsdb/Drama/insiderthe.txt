the insider shooting draft by eric roth michael mann written by all we can see is black filling the screen
black on black
and were in a speeding soviet jeep
two men in front shouldering assault rifles
and there are three men in the back
a middle aged man wearing a tired suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on
and on either side of him two men blindfolded
the man on one side is in his forties hands pressed in the pockets of a well travelled black leather jacket
a stocky man with the edge of a j
salinger character hes seen everything at least once
but even he has lost some of his self confidence here turning his head sensing the wind a blast of arabic music that disappears behind him
hes lowell bergman
on the other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky man with a voltmeter around his neck norman
the jeep races up narrow winding streets of a lebanese village
its shadowed by a jeep in front and in back each carrying personnel armed with aks and a few rpgs
and in the third jeep are two blindfolded not very threatening lebanese soldiers
and as the speeding convoy passes a captured israeli armored personnel carrier covered with arabic graffiti looking down on them from huge murals are the stern visages of the ayatollah
khomeini and a hezbollah religious leader the sheikh fadlallah
and suddenly the convoy skids to a stop
and blindfolded lowell and norman are roughly taken out and pushed stumbling through the cloud of dust without sight
the lanky cameraman is stopped told to wait while lowell is pushed past armed men guarding a small stone house and inside
a round faced man in his mid forties with large framed glasses black hair and a grey black beard wearing a dullbend a turban sits informally at a kitchen table
its the sheikh fadlallah whose face stares out at us from walls
a gunman cradling an ak sits in an incongruous purple armchair in a corner
a torn poster of the seychelles is on one wall
another gunman stands by a window
lowell is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table
how have you liked your stay
droll what ive seen ive liked
the sheikh smiles
and the smile passes as quickly as it came
a steaming cup of coffee in a small arabic demitasse is put down
please to explain why i should agree to interview
with pro zionist american media
because i think hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now
so you care about what youre thought of in america
and in america at this moment in time hezbollah does not have a face
confident thats why
and weve first realized this man is not a hostage hes come here voluntarily
perhaps you prove journalism objectivity and i see the questions first
then i decide if i grant the interview
we dont do that
beat youve seen minutes and mike wallace
so you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity
you also know we are the highest rated most respected tv magazine news show in america
the sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him studying him
and lowell closes lowell contd so
should he get on a plane or not
the sheikh thinks it over and then
tell him i will see him day after tomorrow
after a beat uh you know i want to ask you something
i know it sounds odd
no answer hello sheikh
he hesitates starts to lift his blindfold
he lifts it
and he sees the sheikh and his gunmen are gone
the house empty
only his cameraman the lanky man left there standing by the door still in his blindfold
take your blindfold off
the lanky man does and we see the cameraman is asian american
sarcastic welcome to the world
norman gives lowell an ironic look and tests the local current at an electrical outlet
fluctuating all over the place
anywhere we shoot here its gonna be portable gennies and well run cable
lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding height
baalbek and the beqaa valley below gold domed mosques
a moment of triumph
he dials his cell phone
into phone mike its me
were in a science laboratory
out of focus lab technicians in white lab coats celebrating a heavyset black womans birthday
half her presents are opened
balloons incongruous floating above the lab
and theres a sense that somebody is watching
and from the waist up a disembodied figure comes into focus behind a glass partition as if quarantined isolated an expressionless man in his late forties watching them
the office soundproofed he watches the people laughing their lips moving
his hair not yet settled on grey his face is changing always interesting
born in the bronx educated in upstate new york he retains little of the accent and much of the directness
hes jeffrey wigand
he turns to resume gathering things from his desk
some technical books a medical text on asthma
putting them in his briefcase
and as he leaves the office the silent party like a bizarre mime behind him
briefcase in hand jeffrey appears from the elevator from above from wide and in front his eyes frozen pools
and like a bad dream a broad shouldered man leaning against the wall near the reception island in a suit hes not comfortable in wearing an earphone saying something into
a lapel microphone after jeffreys passed
light mottled through trees reflects off the car window
jeffreys face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and shadow
down this tasteful suburban louisville street of neat houses and manicured lawns
he pulls into driveway behind a series bmw
its a grey french provincial replica
jeffrey comes in and a young girl six is watching television in the den
laufer gave me a star today
he pours himself a drink at a wet bar
little early for cartoons isnt it
dutiful she shuts off the tv going upstairs
barbara contd deborah
he looks outside
a woman is sitting on the back porch drinking wine reading a paperback book drinking wine
theres something like a hockney painting about her against the manicured lawns
right now the woman comes in
shes pretty tall languid reserved somebody it would be nice to wear on your arm
she has an odd delay between a thought and her speech
oh i didnt know you were home
he doesnt say anything
gotta take debbie to ballet
and it all feels suburban familiar
suddenly theres a shout
jeffrey goes quickly up the stairs into
and a little girl eight sitting on the floor in a ballet leotard her head back wheezing her neck muscles contracting and bulging her face pale lips white and her
eyes filled with fear as rapid shallow breathing induces a sense of suffocation
deborah wigand is having a severe asthmatic attack
she was playing with my pooh doll again
jeffrey sits her on the side of her bed next to which is a nebulizer an air compressor to deliver medication via a tube into a circular mouthpiece
the compressor whirs
deborah breathes in the medication
jeffrey brushes the hair back from her face and wipes perspiration from her forehead as
slow down honey
liane rushes in with rolled up towels kneels in front of deborah smiling to mask anxiety and goes into the bathroom with the towels and turns on full blast the
bathtubs hot water
we dont know why yet
deborahs chest heaves
jeffrey gets in front of her and talks to her to arrest her attention
wigand contd here we go
deep breaths deep breaths
she was playing with the pooh doll
poohs dusty sweetheart
hes dusty and you breathed him in okay
so whats whats happening to you now is
cells called mast cells told your lungs dont breathe any more of that dust in
beat and the airways in your lungs are like branches
and when the branches close up you get an asthmatic attack
and we give you medicine and you get better
youre better already arent you
and the medications taking effect and shes calmer
liane hands clutched in her lap smiles at deborah
now she takes deborahs hand and exchanges a look with jeffrey
jeffreys a good father a natural caregiver
wigand contd okay baby
jeffrey liane and the two girls silently eating dinner deborah in a bathrobe
can i go to dance tomorrow im better
if you are then ill take barbara to soccer and take you to dance after
i can take her
dont you have to be at the office
instead getting up is there any more rice
nods yes its on the stove
he goes into the kitchen to the stove seeing
liane contd do you want more rice
how about you
ill take some
can i go over to janeanes house
im sorry darling have you seen my coffee mug
try the car
and liane going outside
she opens jeffreys car looking in the front seat at the cup holders
she turns to leave and sees the backseat filled with two boxes and the books we saw him take
uh what are those boxes
im going to the store
you need anything
what do you need at the store
meaning in the car thats my stuff from the office
why did you take your stuff from the office
simply i didnt want to leave it there
confused i dont understand
matter of fact i got fired this morning
where else am i gonna take it
specifically thomas sandefur
stunned fearful what are we supposed to do
what about our medical coverage what about our health
what about our car payments
the payments on this house
he looks at her
theres an unspoken moment when it seems hes desperate for her to ask how hes feeling
but she doesnt and now theres a wall up and the moment passes
a beat specific theres a severance agreement
it includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage
beat sure you dont need anything
no thank you
and as lianes completely still her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down she wants to ask how he is how he must be feeling and she turns into camera
towards him to do that
but hes driven off down the street
liane contd jeffrey
the sheikh wearing a fresh white robe and skull cap comes into the room
i am very pleased to receive you as my guest mr
thank you for having us
reverse normans camera crew is setting up
mike wallace is there
a dangerous combination of intelligence arrogance and celebrity theres a kinetic quality about him
wallace sits across from the sheikh on a dais of patterned linoleum in incongruous armchairs against a wallpaper mural of a french formal garden
a sound technician wires the sheikh and mike with microphones
norman says something to lowell and then goes out
i think ive got a problem with the gennie
i have to go outside
going outside norman
mike turns his chair to face and slides it closer to the sheikhs chair
the head bodyguard barks something in arabic
the interpreter says something back in arabic
the sheikh absorbed in his notes for the upcoming interview ignores all of this
he says you must not sit so close
re bodyguard i cant conduct an interview from back there
the bodyguard bristling at wallaces tone barks more confrontational arabic
you must move back your chair
will you tell him that when i conduct an interview i sit anywhere i damn please
there is no interview
as mike leaps forward moving inches from the bodyguards face with such sudden ferocity even the bodyguard flinches
im talking to you
more armed men start to enter
mike wallace contd what the hell do you think i am
a year old assassin
you think im gonna karate him to death with this notepad
to interpreter are you interpreting what im saying
good well ask him if arabic is his second language
to interpreter dont interpret that
to both hold it
slow slow to the sheikh sheikh do you mind
if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face mr
the sheikh looks up from his notes nods fixes his chair goes back to his notes
lowell contd is that okay
bodyguard assents to mike are you ready
or you want to keep fucking around and warm up some more
wry thats got my heart started
they know each other well
wallace sits down
alright todd give me the three button on mike please
we are rolling
they roll camera
charming sheikh fadlallah thank you so much for seeing us
changes are you a terrorist
the sheikh didnt expect the mike wallace opening shot between the eyes
am a servant of god
that expression of incredulity
a servant of god
mike tipping his glasses down while the hostile gunmen cradling weapons watch him through the doorway
americans believe that you as an islamic fundamentalist that you are a leader who contributed to the bombing of the u
the ballsiness of wallace asking these questions in this place is impressive
a mail truck is stopped at an odd angle in the street outside an older brick house with a bold redwood big sur like fence on a hillside
beyond the truck is a forever view of the bay
a handle turns
mail truck door opens
mailman carrying a box going through the gate
box is deposited there
its quiet again
the box sitting nakedly by the front door
lowell in sweat pants and an old tee shirt now is on the telephone still in bed
newspapers the new york times the wall street journal san francisco chronicle are spread all over
home as refuge
a tray with large cups of coffee is on a side table
everyone thinks canadian mounties ride horses and rescue ladies from rapids mike
they backed locals in oka in a fight with mohawks over building a golf course on their burial site
they beat up protesters at kanasake
pause whered you hear that
the other phone on a nightstand rings
a woman in her forties sharon tiller enters in a bathrobe brushing her teeth
she answers it
lowell contd droll oh someone took a poll
are all things canadian boring
to lowell its stuart
hes in mexico city
let me call you back
he takes up the line
what new york bank
a young man in his early twenties wanders in
lowell waves at jake his son
to jake no classes this morning
will he go on camera and talk about the mexico city branch
i dont have to be there until ten thirty
lowells son sits on the bed looking at part of a newspaper
and another young man in his early twenties with long hair comes strolling in sharons son josiah
hi mom lowell
lowell still on the phone waves to him
josiah sits on the bed too reading the back of the sports section jake is reading
another line rings sharon getting it
the boys used to them get up and leave
into phone will independent sources corroborate that
the boys coming out of the house together
and seeing the box by the door
shouts back inside dad you got a box out here
and they go out the gate talking walking off along the berkeley street
the box left waiting by the door
looking at her itinerary let me see this
no cause i gotta know where youre going at all times
into phone i cant
ive got to fly to boston tomorrow
lowell comes with the box back to bed
hes already unwrapped it
inside are stacks of papers
he looks at the box cover
no return address
an anonymous sender not unusual for him
he casually looks through the papers
hangs up reading ignition propensity
to sharon you understand any of this
he gives her some papers
we see formulas
scientific data in tables
this looks like a table of temperatures
whos this from
shrugs its anonymous
references to p
motions its got to be philip morris huh
i have to take a shower
as he looks at the papers sharon goes into the bathroom
we see a man in his forties eating a late lunch getting paged in a crowded cafeteria
an old s wpa mural on the wall
his pager goes off
doug oliver walks across the cafeteria to a bank of pay phones and dials
the phone rings
lowell picks it up
into phone hi this is doug oliver
oh hi doug
im doing this story on fire safety
people burning up from falling asleep smoking
i received a shitload of scientific papers from inside philip morris
you or anybody in fda know someone who can translate this stuff into english for me
beat uh yeah
theres the sound of a phone ringing
pull back to reveal lowell outside a cafe with dry cleaning he collected over one shoulder
a little girls voice over deborahs answers
theres a whisper
someones calling for daddy mom
behind lowell is a humming berkeley street
he gestures familiarly to a server who brings out his two take out cappuccinos
lowell nods his thanks pays
lowell contd thank you bob
my names lowell bergman
im did you say berman
im a producer with minutes
minutes the television show
lowell waits for some moments and
on phone he doesnt want to talk to you
how does he know he doesnt want to talk to me
he doesnt know what im calling him about
he doesnt care to know
and she hangs up
and his interest piqued he sets down his cleaning
he calls back
the phone rings and rings
a machine picks it up
jeffrey wigands voice this is the wigands
if youd like to leave a message or send a fax start now
and we see jeffrey wigand sitting at his desk in his office working on his computer hearing lowell
on the machine this is lowell bergman with minutes
im doing a story on fire safety and cigarettes
i have scientific documents from a tobacco company and i could use your help as a consultant explaining these documents to me
my number is area code
ill be there at this number in minutes
he hangs up
jeffrey doesnt react quietly working on his computer
lowells restless waiting
and not getting a call back he tries another tact
he writes a fax please call me at
he writes his number down
he sends the fax
and not getting an answer he gets up starting to leave the room
and suddenly the fax machine rings
he reads a message emerging from the machine
i cant talk to you
he writes on a piece of paper
cant talk to me
wont talk to me
dont want to talk to me
as he faxes it back
wigand reading the return fax from lowell
the fax machine rings again
he reads jeffreys answer
dont want to
hes quiet more than just interested now
theres something beyond intriguing here
he looks through a stack of phone books for something
a nationwide directory
he looks through it and dials wigands phone number again
if youre curious to meet me
wigand working on his computer
lowells voice on his answering machine
on machine im gonna be in the lobby of the seelbach hotel in louisville reading the new york times tomorrow at five oclock
lowell clicks off
and as wigand sits at his computer giving no indication what he might do
an old hotel with faded carpets
lowell in the lobby reading new york times waiting
and instead of looking up every time somebody passes he looks down at peoples shoes
a pair of black wing tips walking by
a womans high heels
a pair of mens tasseled loafers
a lace up brown
a pair of tennis shoes
a cordovan wing tip
the pair of tasseled loafers walking by again
and lowell looks up
and the man in the tasseled loafers turns away
its jeffrey wigand in a suit and a tie with a fortune corporate executive bearing
lowell crosses to the elevators
wigand looks around the lobby and follows lowell in and as the doors close
have you always lived in louisville
brilliant late afternoon sunlight
we pull back to see jeffrey standing by a window silently looking outside to the left
lowell cool waiting hands in his pockets in the middle of the large room
what did you want me to consult about
a sudden knock on the door
turns suspicious whos that
wry thats room service
they usually knock first
calls come on in
over here please
room service brings in a tray with coffee
as lowell signs the bill the room service waiter waiting looks at wigand
their eyes meet
the waiter looks away
lowell contd thank you
and the waiter leaves
pouring how do you like your coffee
lowell gives him his cup of coffee
look i really dont have that much time
nods is there anything you want to know about me mr
i know what i have to know
just so i know you know when i talk to people in confidence it stays that way
abruptly how did a radical journalist from ramparts magazine end up at cbs
lowell looks at him he does his homework
i still do the tough stories
minutes reaches a lot of people
wigands quiet measuring him
after a beat let me see the documents
lowell gives him the box of papers
wigand sits down the box on his lap quietly looking through them
flips to a different heading consults a chart
this is a fire safety product study for philip morris
things of this nature
after a beat i could very easily explain this to you in laymans terms because its from another company
he puts the papers down
wigand contd but thats as far as i go
far as you go where
a beat this issue is a drop in the bucket
i can talk to you about whats in here
but i cant talk to you about anything else
and lowell knows something else is going on here
meaning philip morris documents i signed a confidentiality agreement
i honor agreements
a lot more is going on here
lowell nods a good reporter
doesnt cbs have confidentiality agreements mr
between journalists and management yes i believe they do
but i dont take that seriously
after a beat where do you work
fast did work
the bottom line how much would i get paid
that you have to discuss with cbs business affairs
but for something like this i would say anywhere between thousand
wigand nods okay
should i just take the documents now
if you want to do it
he turns to leave
lowell gets the door for him
wigand momentarily slows
i worked as the head of research and development for brown williamson tobacco company
i was a corporate vice president
and he goes out the door
wigands job title resonates
lowell turns to the window casually looking into the early evening
and he comes face to face with what wigand was staring at the brown williamson tobacco company headquarters building lit up right across the street
on screen president assad of syria said that difficult obstacles remain but that his country quote looks forward to a great long peace with israel
suddenly lights come on
executive producer don hewitt is suddenly on his feet
a veritable dervish in constant motion
kissing mike its a peabody mike
when youre dead and buried hezbollah is the one theyre gonna remember you for
mike used to him ignores him getting up turning to leave hewitt on his tail
to his editor come in earlier on mikes marine barracks line when hes talking to sheikh mussawi
you eating with us
bring a tie so theyll let us in the front door
and lowell gestures for an olive skinned woman in her late thirties lowells assistant debbie deluca to join them
the eye contact on the way out says theres something important he needs to tell her
theres a blast of noise
lowell wallace hewitt debbie enter from the cbs lobby moving through the reflections
lowell is about to say something to debbie but bill felling evening news assignment editor coming the other way
midstream fast oh bill
main justice is investigating a major new york bank
laundering narco dollars out of their mexico city branch
you want it for the evening news
what about you you got a crew already
im gonna do a follow up
leaves catch ya later
and now as they cross madison
to debbie finally i want you to get legal onto corporate confidentiality agreements
boundaries of their constraint
kentucky state law about
i want you to drop everything
cuts in okay
hewitt stops to buy a newspaper
he doesnt have change debbie does
and mike lowell and don bang into michaels restaurant
we see them through the glass being greeted people shaking their hands escorted by the maitre d to their table as
meanwhile its static
jeffrey sits in the reception area of the brown williamson tobacco company headquarters
complimentary cigarettes are arranged on tables
a dark quiet
the hush of big business
standing in the background by a wall next to the banks of elevators is an ever present man another one with an earphone and lapel microphone
to wigand mr
wigand you can go up now
he gets up crossing to an elevator
re his distraction sorry
im accepting an award from the retinitis pigmentosa foundation
its going to kill the rest of my day
thomas sandefur is absorbed in spreadsheets of regional sales figures
dark pouches are under his eyes
he doesnt look up
he doesnt look healthy
were in a luxurious office with a view of louisville
jeffrey is waiting in a chair
sandefur is brown williamsons ceo
two lawyers their briefcases like weapons close at hand sit on a couch
their jackets are off
they wear expensive shirts
thomas sandefur contd finishing looking up at jeffrey so
you had a chance to play golf
surprisingly affable sandefur prides himself on his salesmans sunny manners
he has a mellifluous georgia accent
to the lawyers jeffs a premiere golfer
what are you a two handicap
to lawyer and he gets out there and he has five strokes on us
he has more concentration than anybody ive ever met
its spooky how he can concentrate
id rather play than talk about it
beat what did you want to see me about
i dont like being back here
sandefur smiles used to him
jeffrey says exactly whats on his mind
most people consider what theyre saying
jeffrey just charges right ahead
smiles after a beat now i know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with brown williamson jeff
chapter and verse
nods yeah i know you do
beat you know i came up through sales
one of the reasons i was a great salesman was i never made a promise i couldnt keep
beat i knew that if i ever broke my promise id suffer the consequence
and theres a warning behind it
contained is that a threat
we worked together for what was it three years
now the work we did here is confidential not for public scrutiny
any more than are ones family matters
quietly you threatening my family now too
now dont be paranoid jeff
a beat about the direction of research here we may have had our differences of opinion
smile scorn you declare as a badge of honor you dont even know what makes water boil
thats why we hire scientists
interrupts direct okay
a beat honest i dont believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements
i was paid well for my work
the health and welfare benefits are good
the severance package is fair
i have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which i said i wouldnt
i appreciate all that jeff
but upon reflection
weve decided to expand our zone of comfort with you
and theres a seriousness that weighs heavily on the room
so weve drafted a supplement to your agreement
it broadly defines and expands in more detail what is confidential
nobody will be able to say well hells bells margaret i didnt know that was a secret
beat were very serious about protecting our interests
a beat wed like you to sign it
and hes acutely aware of the threat behind it
a beat and if i dont
speaking for sandefur if we arrive at the conclusion youre acting in bad faith
we would terminate right now payouts under your severance package
you and your familys medical benefits
and initiate litigation against you mr
a beat dr wigand
after youve examined the document you will see it is in your own best interest and youll sign it
jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney
and we see on his face the true nature of this man
so what you are saying is it isnt enough that you fired me
for no good reason
now you question my integrity
on top of the humiliation of being fired
you threaten me
you threaten my family
beat it never crossed my mind not to honor my agreement
turning to sandefur but i will tell you mr
sandefur and brown williamson too
a beat well fuck you
and with that he gets up and leaves
and its quiet
im not sure he got the message
with total confidence oh i think he did
wigand picks up the phone and dials
theyve finished lunch
wallace and hewitt are turned to talk to sam cohn and an older writer as suddenly lowells cell phone rings
you fucked me
who is this
crazed protect your sources
you screwed me
you sold me out
what are you talking about
where are you
fuck you too
and he slams down the phone
lowell holding the dead phone in his hand
we see a brightly lit golf driving range empty the wet grass under the lights vibrant emerald green
a caged cart with one big yellow headlight like some kind of strange insect drives across the range picking up golf balls
and we see jeffrey hitting golf balls driving one after another after another
his swing is powerful angry a lone golfer trying to chill out
he pauses spent
settling down he exhales
then he looks down the way
and he slows
he sees in the far distance spot lit one other lone golfer a stocky man incongruously in a suit and tie watching him
and the man in the suit right then with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a golf ball
the ball slamming into the steel net
and the lights suddenly go out
the range closing for the night
the insect comes to a stop
and its quiet dark
jeffrey gathers up his clubs
he crosses his golf shoes the metal cleats clicking on the pavement toward the parking lot
and theres the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind him
and the stocky man in the suit carrying a golf bag walking some distance behind him staring at him
jeffrey comes to the parking lot
just jeffreys car and despite all the empty spaces another car purposely or otherwise parked right next to his
he crosses to his car getting in
he drops the three clubs in the rear seat and settles behind the wheel
and he sees the man in the suit has gotten in the car next to his
they look at each other
the man in no hurry lights a cigarette relaxes
its malevolent as hell
and jeffrey suddenly grabbing a golf club jumps out of his car
golf club in hand at the driver side window
motioning with the club threatening stay away from me
you stay away from me
the man starts his car and drives off nonplussed
and as jeffrey with the golf club stands in the empty parking lot not knowing whats threatening him something real something imaginary
a violent rains falling
and we see jeffrey coming out of the house holding an umbrella over his little girls
they start towards the car
theres the sound of a car door shutting
liane carrying lunch boxes comes after them
jeffrey you forgot their lunches she slows seeing someone
jeffrey turns its lowell
wigand how do you do
to the girls protectively jump in quick cmon
im lowell bergman
we spoke on the phone remember
the girls climb in the car
lowell crosses behind the audi around the far side
i want to talk to you
i want to talk to you
jeff closes the door on his daughters and joins lowell around the far side of the car
confronting him what do
running over i did not burn you
i did not give you up to anyone
continuing this is my house
in front of my wife my kids
what business do we have
to straighten something out with you
so you didnt mention my name
you havent talked to anybody about me
why am i gonna mention your name
how did brown williamson know i spoke to you
how the hell do i know about brown williamson
it happened after i talked to you
i do not like coincidences
and i dont like paranoid accusations
im a journalist
use your head
how do i operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it
skeptical you came all the way down here to tell me that
i did not
big tobacco is a big story
and you got something important to say
i can tell
a beat personal but yes
i came all the way down here to tell you story no story fuck your story i dont burn people
it starts to rain harder
they look at each other
jeffrey without saying a word gets in the car
he backs out
lowell left standing in the driveway with liane in the rain
liane goes back into the house
and lowell starts back across the street to his car
theres a sound
jeffreys car having gone around the corner has come back and stopped in the street
after a beat ride with me while i take the girls to school
lowell hesitates then gets into the car in the back seat
they drive away
lowell incongruously sitting in the back seat with barbara
jeffrey and deborah in the front seat
and its quiet just the sound of the wipers on the window
and as lowell rides with them
we see the cars parked in a weed strewn empty lot
rain pounding on it and the surface of the river beyond
and my little girl has acute asthma
my eldest daughter
the girls are gone
we enter mid scene
lowells still in the back seat
and im unemployed
so i have to protect my medical coverage
the bottom line turning to look at lowell in the rear seat so i left them a message this morning
their expanded confidentiality agreement
i will sign it
theyre afraid of you arent they
they should be
the sound of the rain
after a beat trying to make it easier for him talk to me outside the zone of your agreement
guarded like what
like whered you work before brown williamson
a beat johnson johnson
union carbide in japan
i was general manager and director of new products
i speak japanese
i was a director of corporate development at pfizer
all health related
wry what else
outside the zone
i dont know
you think the knicks are gonna make it through the semi finals
as their eyes meet in the rear view mirror
a subtle connection
jeffs car in the field the giant colgate palmolive clock behind
the rain stopped
steam rises from the weed strewn empty lot
lowells in the front seat
and we get the feeling theyve been talking for hours
just give me an example
james burke the ceo of johnson johnson
when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in tylenol bottles he didnt argue with the fda
he didnt even wait for the fda to tell him
he just pulled tylenol off every shelf of every store right across america
and then he developed the safety cap
because look as a ceo sure hes gotta be a great businessman right
but hes also a man of science
hes not going to allow his company
to put on the shelf
a product that might hurt people
sarcastic not like the seven dwarfs
the seven ceos of big tobacco
they got up in front of congress that time
it was on television
and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction disease
it was on c span
okay so here you are
you go to work for tobacco
after beat you come from corporate cultures where research really creative thinking these are core values
you go to tobacco
tobacco is a sales culture
market and sell enormous volume
go to a lot of golf tournaments
the hell with everything else
beat what are you doing
why are you working for tobacco in the first place
deadly honest i cant talk about it
the work i was supposed to do
might have had some positive effect
i dont know
it could have been beneficial
bitterness there mostly i got paid a lot
i took the money
my wife was happy
my kids had good medical
got a great house
simply i mean what the hell is wrong with that
he looks at lowell as if needing validation
nothings wrong with that
thats it youre making money
youre providing for your family
what could be wrong with that
after some moments
ive always thought of myself
as a man of science
thats whats wrong with it
youre in a state of conflict jeff
jeffrey doesnt say anything
because look heres how it lays out if you got vital insider stuff the american people for their welfare really do need to know
and you feel impelled to disclose it and violate your agreement in doing so thats one thing
on the other hand if you want to honor this agreement then thats simple
you do so
you say nothing
you do nothing
theres only one guy who can figure that out for you
and thats you
all by yourself
is it too evenhanded
as wigand contemplates the edge hes standing on theyre quiet
then wigand sees the time
ive got to go pick up the girls
they only had half a day
jeffrey starts the car
the windshield wipers screech on a dry window
their eyes meet
as they drive off
we hold on the colgate palmolive clock
weve entered mid scene
a monitor on a cart plays a inch vcr of a c span broadcast
seven ceos of big tobacco
in front of a bas relief of the american eagle
each in turn swears nicotine is not addictive or he doesnt know anything about health risks theyre not sure maybe maybe not etc
he referred to this
the seven dwarfs
what seven dwarfs
the seven ceos of big tobacco
referred to this
said they should be afraid of him
i assume afraid of what he could reveal
to staff lawyers now you tell me
what does this guy have to say that threatens these people
and now we see lowell mike wallace and debbie deluca with two staff lawyers mark stern and john harris sitting around a workstation used as an improvised eating area
beyond them are the minutes offices workstations piles of material television monitors hanging from the ceiling all tuned to cbs programming
well it isnt cigarettes are bad for you
hardly new news
re video what that is is tobaccos standard defense
its the we dont know litany addiction
we believe not
we dont know
we take a bunch of leaves roll em together
you smoke em
youre on your own
we dont know
tells me nothing
beat besides youll never get what hes got
because of this guys confidentiality agreement he is never gonna be able to talk to you
thats not good enough
this guy is the top scientist in the number three tobacco company in america
hes a corporate officer
you never get whistle blowers from fortune companies
this guy is the ultimate insider
hes got something to say he wants to say it i want it on minutes
doesnt matter what he wants am i missing something here
what do you mean mike
hes got a corporate secrecy agreement
give me a break
this is a public health issue like an unsafe airframe on a passenger jet or
some company dumping cyanide into the east river
issues like that
he can talk we can air it
theyve got no right to hide behind a corporate agreement
re his coffee pass the milk
does they dont need the right
theyve got the money
the unlimited checkbook
thats how big tobacco wins every time
they spend you to death
million a year in outside legal
ken starrs firm kirkland and ellis
gm and ford they get nailed after or pick ups blow up
these clowns have never
i mean ever
not even once
not even with hundreds of thousands dying each year from an illness related to their product
have ever lost a personal injury lawsuit
on this case theyll issue gag orders sue for breach anticipatory breach enjoin him you us his pet dog the dogs veterinarian
tie him up in litigation for ten of fifteen years
im telling you they bat a thousand
he knows that
thats why hes not gonna talk to you
lowells been quiet thinking about something else
okay lets look through the looking glass the other way
what do you mean
we got a guy
who wants to talk but hes constrained
beat what if he were compelled
eating oh torture
what do you mean compelled
seriously i mean compelled by a justice department state courts be a witness
that would cut through any confidentiality agreement wouldnt it
what does that do
what do you mean whats it do
what i mean is like how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement
because he has to reveal it in a court of law
its on record its out
its no secret anymore
so how can they restrain his speech or retaliate
its out in the world
nods if you could engineer it into the court record you might have something
they would have a helluva time trying to restrain his speech then wouldnt they
still skeptical yeah but what venue
and where does he get does he have killer attorneys
i dont think hes got any attorneys
hes gonna need attorneys who arent afraid of risking years of litigation
and millions of dollars of their own dough in legal costs
what do you say mike
what do you think
pause even if he gets the defense team will he go for it
youre awfully overqualified dr
the aftermath of a high school lunch
tables covered with litter as far as the eye can see
and we see jeffrey sitting with a formidable black woman in her mid fifties the high school principal cynthia watson drinking cups of coffee
after a beat awkward im trying to
start a new career
i believe i could be a good teacher
she senses this applicant has a lot on his mind
let me give it some thought
selling and not a lot of companies in the health care field hire ex tobacco scientists
she nods studying him
they get up
the house is nearly empty
liane arms folded across her chest is quietly standing in the empty living room
jeffrey comes down the stairs
and its quiet
and liane holds herself overcome
beat thats where our babies were born
debbie took her first steps right there
in the grass
and theyre quiet
i didnt plan on this
liane looks at him afraid
and as he moves to hold her
hey hey hey cmon
we can make this work for us
its a smaller scale
more time together
more time with the kids
more time for us okay
can you imagine me coming home from some job feeling good at the end of the day
this is gonna be better
this is gonna be better
and instead of this downturn turning them against each other it brings them closer together
and as they stand in the empty house
we see unpacked boxes in the small s kitchen
country western music is playing on a radio
and we see liane busily putting things away in a cabinet
and then stops and looks out the window
she tightens a knob on a cabinet
theres a moment of domestic peace for her as she sees
jeffrey with the girls in a part of the backyard kneeling in the dirt planting a vegetable garden putting in some small tomato trellises
we see the house now
its a small one story
deborah sees her mom and waves
its an image from the s post war boom
liane waves back from behind the pane of glass
jeffreys asleep on his side next to liane her back to him
his arm is draped over her protectively
theres a sound
and he sees barbara in her nightgown standing in the doorway
terrified whispers whats that outside daddy
did you see somebody or did you hear them
i heard them
in the backyard
fast soundlessly hes out of bed into old moccasins and trousers
jeffrey goes into a corner of the basement around the corner from the furnace where his office is now
unpacked boxes are on the floor
he fumbles with the combination lock on a small gun safe lifts the lid taking out a hand gun
barbara followed him
sit at daddys desk okay
why dont you just sit up at the desk
get out some paper and draw me a picture okay
what are you gonna draw me baby
an animal something like that
you stay down here until daddy gets back
you stay down here
he keeps it hidden from barbara
he goes up the stairs
he steps further out onto the lawn with its dark shrubs and small tree in the corner
meanwhile barbara in the basement starts as the water heater comes on scaring her
she goes up the stairs to follow after her father
meanwhile jeffrey has crossed towards the darker back corners
he spins gun ready
and the yellow eyes of a raccoon stare at him
to himself you almost got your damn head blown off
the raccoon defiantly bares its teeth
jeffrey starts to go
but he sees something and stops
meanwhile barbara has come to the sliding glass door
jeffrey sees one of the tomato trellises is crushed stepped on
and in the vegetable gardens earth are distinct fresh deep footprints
wigand steps between her and the garden hiding it
extremely close on jeffrey as he covers trying to keep from his daughter the invasion trying to control his emotions
reassuring her its just a raccoon baby
he crosses to her putting his arm around her walking her back inside
you know what that means
that means that they only come out at nighttime
he locks the sliding glass door takes a last look outside
the phone suddenly rings
lowell asleep alone
he gets it
its dark save a light from the living room
liane in bed seemingly sleeping
and we see jeffrey just outside their door in the foyer sitting on the floor against a curved wall a drink at his side on the telephone
a man with no one to talk to
after a beat lowell
lowell sits up
is it too late
no its okay
hows hows the new place
the new place
intuiting you okay
lowell knows he isnt
you know i was thinking of calling you tomorrow anyway
beat how are your kids handling the new house
beat you have kids
we have a couple
ones hers ones mine
everybody uses a different name
wry modern marriage
beat hows liane
he looks at liane for beat
we see his pov in medium shot
then he moves and sits on the floor in the living room
hold on a minute lowell
after a beat somebody
may be following me
i dont know
they came on the property
what do you mean followed you
did you call the police
i dont want to be paranoid
i mean maybe its a game
some kind of mind game
well what do you really think though
i dont know what the fuck really think
are they doing it
is some crank doing it
are they doing it to make me feel paranoid
are they doing it for real and dont give a shit what i think
i dont know
i dont fucking know
and its quiet again
lowell sitting in bed on the phone alarmed sharing wigands fears
jeffrey describe for me in detail what happened
and jeffreys emotions are back in check as
well no look
i mean there was a footprint
its probably not important at all
beat you know i got a job now
im teaching high school
japanese and chemistry
beat so what were you calling about
you called me
he takes another drink
no you said you were going to call me tomorrow
so what about
after a beat oh yes yes yes i did
i wanted to talk to you
i wanted to hook up and talk to you
about what we were talking about in your car
after a beat makes you feel good
putting what you know to use
jeffreys impressed by lowells perceptivity
howd you know that lowell
its obvious isnt it
he looks at liane in the next room asleep
you there yeah
look thanks for talking
im sorry i woke you up
jeffrey hesitates holding the phone then he hangs up
but the phone rings right away
but theres thick silence
who is this
do not call here
they hang up
and he realizes hes talking to a dial tone
he hangs up
and as he sits in the patch of light from a street lamp the gun in his hand on his lap to be up all night guarding his family
and past lianes sleeping form down the hall into the living room is her husband his back to her sitting in the trapezoid of light
and as we dolly along her side we come upon her face and discover shes been up all along and her eyes are pressed shut her hands over her ears
her reaction to his raging on the phone
shes far from okay
and we see lowell and wigand sitting in their stocking feet at a traditional japanese table in a private screened room
a traditionally dressed japanese waitress waiting to take their order
wigand conversing with her in japanese
the waitress formally nods and leaves
what did you get us
and wigand drinks some more saki
wigand contd the internet said you did graduate work in wisconsin then went to uc la jolla with professor
he was my mentor
he had a major influence on the new left in the late s
and on me personally
next to your father
what the hells that got to do with my father
is that why you became a journalist
then you get to ask all the questions
you charge by the hour
my father was a mechanical engineer
most ingenious man i ever knew
well my father left us when i was five years old
he was not the most ingenious man i ever knew
lets get back to brown williamson
if you decide to go on minutes i got to know everything about why you got fired
theyre gonna dig up stuff from your past theyre gonna throw it at you
i got to know what theyre gonna throw
concedes i drink
a couple of occasions more than i should have
thinks i was cited for shoplifting once
but it was a mistake
hesitant after a beat i pushed liane one time
we were both stressed out because of the pressure
she went to her mothers
out of the blue i got fired because when i get angry i have difficulty censoring myself
and i dont like to be pushed around
im not pushing you around
after a beat im asking you questions
im just a commodity to you arent i
i could be anything
anything worth putting on between commercials
honest to a network probably were all commodities
beat to me
you are not a commodity
what you are is important
and hes begun to consciously or unconsciously sell
lowell contd you go public and thirty million people hear what you got to say nothing i mean nothing will ever be the same again
wigand doesnt react
lowell contd you believe that
because when youre done a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion my friend
and thats the power you have
you believe that i believe that
yes i believe that
you believe that because you get information out to people
maybe thats just what youve been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job
and maybe for the audience its just voyeurism
something to do on a sunday night
and maybe it wont change a fucking thing
and people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry
are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here
i never abandoned a source
i dont think you really understand running over no dont evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or minutes with this cheap skepticism
i have to put my familys welfare on the line here my friend
and what are you puttin up
youre puttin up words
while youve been dickin around at fucking company golf tournaments i been out in the world giving my word and backing it up with action
lowell is getting very close in spite of the value of wigand to telling jeff to take his story and stick it up his ass
lowell contd now are you going to go do this thing or not
wigand abruptly rises
surprisingly mild i said id call the kids before they went to bed
and turning he crosses the restaurant
and thats where it hangs
and we see were watching footage in an on line editing bay from what we will learn is lowells n
blue on police corruption in new orleans
lowell tony baldo his editor debbie and an intense young man wearing glasses an intern looking at the cut
all the police are on horseback lots of cops on horses lowell is waiting for a call to go through
the stringer was supposed to be shooting b roll on street cops in new orleans
whats with all the horses
camera guys got a thing about mounted police
re horses dont any of these guys ride in cars or walk
how long did he stay on this
what was he seeing
into phone yes hello
im trying to reach mr
and we see the pilot a fit looking unassuming man wearing aviator glasses in his late forties
a heavyset man in his forties riding up in the co pilots seat well come to know as ron motley
the pilots on a headset
he has a distinctive southern accent
this is richard scruggs
could you hold on one second please
to lowell lowell i got him on the phone
hello im lowell bergman
this is lear november
after a beat request a flight level on a heading of degrees
after a beat mr
yes im right here
could you call me back on a hard line
ill call you then
through the window we see scruggs plane being refueled while scruggs and motley in a run down lounge are talking on a speaker phone with lowell
theyve taken over the secretarys office for privacy
re footage what do we do with that
the phone rings
i dont know
you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the state of mississippi did you not
nods thats right
after a beat well im working with someone now who was the former head of research at brown williamson a former corporate officer there
whats your interest in this mr
well he may tape an interview with us
and we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection
it could work
if its public record its public record
yeah and hes going to need legal representation
he sure as hell will
a beat has he decided to go public
because let me tell you weve been doing this for three years now and weve worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle blowers so we know
big tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him
so is your man truly committed
well actually no
well hes on the fence
thats the point
scruggs and motley exchange a look
well wed certainly be interested in making his acquaintance but without knowing what hes going to do
well would you want him to call you
or you want to call him
how do you want to do it
no nonsense it would be better if he called us
at this moment these two attorneys are unsold on the prospect of jeffrey wigand
lowell contd shit
contemplating phone to debbie re show oh we need cops on the street
we dont need them on horses
i dont know what he was thinking
oh for gods sake what has this guy got a horse fetish
get me to new orleans this afternoon
ill shoot the fucking thing myself
tighten on mounted new orleans police at crime scene herding crowd
liane cooking dinner making pasta
ingredients diced tomato basil are neatly ordered
shes waiting for water to boil
the kids are doing homework on the round table in the kitchenette
its an idle moment
shes dazed out watching them
what are you cooking
im cooking pasta primavera
oh i love that stuff
and now she hears from the basement the bell ring on jeffreys computer
its a tiny bell incessant
she crosses to the basement stairs
im going to have to go downstairs
liane down the stairs approaching jeffreys computer
and she sees an incoming e mail icon a large letter with wings flying repetitively across the screen
the bell ringing is louder
she calls up the e mail
on the screen in large red letters and now liane is shouting and running up the stairs and
jeffrey having arrived home from work pulls the mail out of the mailbox now stands frozen staring at something
and he sees standing upright in the back of the mail box like a monument of threat a single hollow point
liane and the girls are running toward him
like in a bad fucking dream
hes looking at them
liane is saying something about e mail but his slow motion attention is still arrested by the statuesque bullet
as they close on him
and we see lowell lit by flashing police lights
were at a crime scene
uniformed cops on horseback
just arrived the cameramans unloading his gear preparing to shoot b roll
dispatch received a call of shots fired in the area
uniforms arrived on the scene and found this white male subject shot to death
was it gang related
theres no indication as far as a tag or an advertisement
police moving around as lowells cell phone rings
answering excuse me
theyre terrorizing us
to my family my kids
what are you talking about
someone put a bullet in my mailbox
jeff call the fbi right away
they do this with impunity
they get to go home at night
what does it cost these people to do this to us
my girls are crying so fuck them
i want to tape
im done thinking about it
frustrated i heard you
but i got to arrange a legal defense first
i got to get you to testify in court get it on public record
cuts in then hold it off the air until you got that
but i want to go to new york
and i want to go on the record
ill call them lowell
and two older local fbi agents and are sitting with jeffrey in his living room
did you handle the round mr
yes im afraid i did
we wont be able to lift usable prints
do you own a gun mr
what caliber is your gun
what caliber is my gun
what caliber is your gun
a dawning realization what does that have to do with the price of tea in china
now one of the kids is crying liane trying to calm her takes her out of the room
a beat realizing you think i put that bullet in the mailbox myself
if we could take a look mr
and he gets up
they follow him into the bedroom
he unlocks the side drawer on his night stand taking out a gun giving it to one of the agents
why do you keep this gun
i dont think its unconstitutional yet to own a gun
im a target shooter
that bullet was for a
do you own a
yes i do
in my gun safe downstairs
a target pistol
after a beat do you have a history of emotional problems mr
yes i do
beat yes i get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox
and we hear lianes voice from downstairs
upset i didnt tell you that so you could just pick it up and take it away
and we see liane following fbi agent coming up the stairs from the basement and the agent is carrying jeffreys computer
whats going on
i told him that you had an e mail death threat that said if you didnt shut the f up they were going to kill you
agent starts out of the house with the computer followed by
jeffrey runs out after them
outraged you cant take that
its personal property
we have a search warrant mr
theres been a death threat
after him my files
agent ignores him putting the computer in the trunk of their car
and fbi agent the
bullet in a baggie comes out of the house
letters to my brother
his shoes slip on the grass and he falls
and the fbi are getting into their car
and neighbors have come out watching them
liane and the girls standing halfway down the front lawn the neighbors looking at them
she and jeffrey look at each other
will she go to him or not
she goes to him as he rises
wigand contd that computer has everything
you alright mr
we need to take a look at your gun safe mr
interrupts im telling you your agents in that office are acting improperly
now who are they trying to protect
and we see a man in his early forties a neatly dressed man who prides himself on his appearance at his desk in the bureau fbi
hes completely distracted focused on agent travel orders
let me tell you something lowell
look look look
youre talking about two agents in a regional office in louisville
i got the goddamn unabomber threatening to blow up lax
i gotta move agents from all over the country into l
when i get a chance ill give it a look
heated you better take a good look
because im getting two things pissed off and curious
now any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire
either one of those guys have ex agent pals already in those jobs
like for instance their ex supervisor whos already at brown williamson as we fucking speak
beat ill give it a look
youre getting my drift
ill give it a look
he hangs up
and we slide by some elegant diners to fall onto lowell and mike wallace with jeffrey and liane in the hotels dining room having ordered dinner
so is everything okay
how are the rooms
to mike yes very
you know i enjoy your work so much
when youre talking to somebody i always feel like im right there
and she laughs
thank you got saying that
do you think we could talk about the taping
tomorrows taping just so we can get it out of the way and order
yeah well questions will go toward what work you did there why you were fired
and others will deal
not sure she quite heard taping
beat what are you taping
im doing an interview
whispers an interview
do you know what they will do to us
but she suddenly gets up and leaves hurrying out of the dining room
and jeffrey oddly doesnt move
trying to intervene liane this is a preliminary
after a beat you didnt tell her we were taping
what did she think she was coming to new york for
to talk about it
to think about it
i had a plan to ease her into it
but i really i didnt know how to do that
jeffrey abruptly crosses to the nearby bar
who are these people
frustrated ordinary people
under extraordinary pressure mike
what the hell do you expect
grace and consistency
and lowell leaves the table
and as mike wallace sits at the table looking around wondering what the fuck hes doing there
liane folds her arms protectively across her chest
and we see a small taping studio separated by flats and black curtains from other cbs news sets
cameras are set up
and we enter mid scene on jeffrey in a more formal demeanor sitting in a chair mike wallace sitting across from him under the lights taping an interview
lowell off camera
you heard mr
sandefur say before congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive
nods i believe mr
sandefur perjured himself because i watched those testimonies very carefully
jeffreys statements are stunning and powerful revelations
and dangerous ones to make
all of us did
there was this whole line of people
whole line of ceos up there all swearing
part of the reason im here is i felt that their representation clearly misstated at least within brown williamsons representation clearly misstated what is common language within the company
we are in the nicotine delivery business
and thats what cigarettes are for
a delivery device for nicotine
a delivery device for nicotine
put it in your mouth light it up and youre gonna get your fix
youre gonna get your fix
youre saying that brown williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix not by artificially adding nicotine but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such
nods the process is known as impact boosting
while not spiking nicotine they clearly manipulate it
theres extensive use of this technology know as ammonia chemistry
it allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system
the straw that broke the camels back for me and really put me in trouble with sandefur was a compound called coumarin
when i came on board at b w they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste and had been unsuccessful
i wanted it out immediately
i was told that it would affect sales so i should mind my own business
i constructed a memo to mr
sandefur indicating i could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew we had documentation was similar to coumadin a lung specific carcinogen
and you sent the document forward to sandefur
i sent the document forward to sandefur
i was told that we would continue to work on a substitute we werent going to remove it as it would impact sales and that that was his decision
in other words you were charging sandefur and brown williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously most certainly
and on march thomas sandefur ceo of brown williamson had you fired
and the reason he gave you
poor communication skills
and do you wish you hadnt come forward
you wish you hadnt blown the whistle
yeah there are times i wish i hadnt done it
there are times i feel compelled to do it
if you asked me would i do it again
do i think its worth it
yeah i think its worth it
not too many kids paying attention
meanwhile jeffrey has written his name on the blackboard
in unison hi
my name is jeff wigand
you can call me mr
wigand you can call me dr
wigand i have a ph
in biochemistry and endocrinology you can call me jeff
beat anything else you want to call me
youll have to do so in private
a few kids smile okay
i find chemistry to be magical
i find it an adventure
an exploration into the building blocks of our physical universe
beat so how many of you have taken chemistry before
nobody raises their hands
easy smile okay
ive never taught it before so were gonna be fine
a couple of laughs
and we feel jeffrey for the first time is in a milieu that suits him
wigand contd our first experiment is
holds up cigarette lighter going to be measuring the molecular weight of butane
scruggs office is decorated with watercolors of phantom jets and a s as scruggs takes off his glasses
hes on line three
jeffrey wigand is on a pay phone in the corridor crowded with students
scruggs jeff wigand
lowell bergman said i should give you a call
my co counsel ron motley and i have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the state of mississippi to get the state reimbursed medicaid costs for
treating people with smoking related illness
beat if youd be interested in talking to us wed certainly like to talk to you
when should we do this
jeffrey drives up the block and onto his driveway
seeing a man in a suit an ear piece in his ear disappearing around the corner of his house jeffrey leaps out of the car
but the front doors open
so instead of chasing after he runs inside
and he sees another man is in the living room
who the hell are you
what are you doing in my house
and he sees lowell enter from the dining room
its okay jeff
wigand you need to speak to
wry its okay
you got your own security now
wigand catches his breath
lowell i cant afford they volunteered
a friend owns a large security company
how are you doing mr
im jon talifaro
therell be three of us on detail
crossing through im going to the store
please explain our new houseguests to your children
and wigand looks at lowell
barbara comes into the living room and holds onto her fathers leg
i called richard scruggs in mississippi
im going to be a witness for them in their litigation
so im going to fly to pascagoula to give a deposition
im going to go there tonight
did you have a good day
yes i did
i had a great day
to kids want to play that game we were playing before
you know i think you got it up to five
i was ahead of you
she goes over and holds his hand
and as he holds her hand seeing what his life has become he looks up and his glance connects with lowell
we see out the window a security guard incongruous walking by
and we see liane finished with the dinner dishes silently wiping off the sink
theres a pall you could cut with a knife
a moment and jeffrey comes in the kitchen door from the garden
he stops to wash his hands in the sink
please dont wash your hands in the sink
where should i wash them
use the bathroom
whats the difference
thats for food
but he ignores her washing his hands
and she turns the water off
he turns it back on
he thinks then turns it off
then she turns it on liane contd leave it on
just leave it on okay
and she turns and leaves the room coldly all her anger repressed
for jeffrey everything else and now this
the running faucet
the house on the quiet suburban street
a security guard incongruous a noticeable bulge where his shoulder holster is sitting watch under the porch light on the small front porch in a metal porch chair
and we see jeffrey unable to sleep sitting at his desk alone in the basement listening to classical music
he instinctively turns
and he sees liane in her bathrobe has come down to sit on the basement stairs
he looks over at her
and he thinks shes come down to make up
and all she really wants him to do is say i need you
but he cant
and like ships that pass in the night nothings said
she puts her hands protectively in her robe pockets
and she starts to cry
i dont think i can do this
i want to stand by my husband
i really do jeffrey
but i dont think i can do this anymore
i am so sorry
can we talk about this when i get back
she goes back up the stairs
and as jeffrey sits in the basement and the music plays
we see jeffrey and his security man
he passes a small filipino woman in a nurses uniform and a man in clerical garb who hands him a small american flag asking for donations
and now he passes through the metal detector
he nods thanks and walks towards us relaxing looking behind every so often to see if anybody is following him
as he passes gate he hears over his shoulder
jeffrey turns and the man throws a sheaf of subpoenas at his chest
nasty youve been served
and he turns and walks off
and as jeffrey looks down at the subpoenas
jeffrey is sitting with scruggs and motley in scruggs kitchen around a semi circular counter
coffee and sweet rolls
no ones dressed for court
scruggs has been looking through the sheaf of subpoenas
about motley we sense power held in reserve
now what this one is is a temporary restraining order a gag order issued by a kentucky court
meanwhile a movie star handsome man in shirtsleeves and a tie a coffee cup in his hand enters and sits casually on the arm of a chair
introducing jeff wigand michael moore
good to meet you dr
mikes our attorney general down here
to moore i was just explaining to jeff they got a kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today
now they tried to get the mississippi court to honor it but the judge threw it out
to jeffrey however for you there is a more perilous effect to the kentucky gag order
after a beat dr
wigand you do understand what could happen dont you
im not free to testify
if you violate the kentucky order when you step foot back in kentucky they can find you in contempt and they can incarcerate you
and you ought to know that
and jeffrey fairly turns white its never occurred to him he might go to jail
that is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today
how does one
what does my family do
go on welfare
if my wife has to work
whos going to look after the kids
put food on the table
my children need me
if im not teaching
theres no medical
even on co pay thats like
wigand listen you may not be able to do this thing
as i understand from dick youre our key witness
and i hope you dont withdraw
i guess wed all understand if you did
at watch guys ive got to go
im gonna be late for court
ill see yall a little later
wigand good luck
and jeffreys quiet frightened
having shaken the departing moores hand he now turns away from scruggs and motley thinking about consequences
i know what youre facing jeff
and i think i know how youre feeling
jeffreys skeptical anybody could know how it is
low personal in the navy i flew a s off carriers
in combat events have a duration of seconds sometimes minutes
but what youre going through goes on day in and day out
whether youre ready for it or not week in week out
month after month after month
whether youre up or whether youre down
youre assaulted psychologically
youre assaulted financially which is its own special kind of violence
because its directed at your kids
what school can you afford
how will that affect their lives
youre asking yourself will that limit what they may become
you feel your whole familys futures compromised
after a beat do know how it is
a white traditional southern house with a veranda and gables
a large front lawn with weeping willows
and we see lowell hands in his pockets not an insider or an outsider waiting alone on the expansive lawn
the front door opens
a mississippi state trooper putting on his round brimmed hat comes out and crosses the driveway
then jeffrey coming out with motley
motley talks to him on the veranda for a moment and then heads towards his car
meanwhile jeffrey comes down over to lowell on the lawn
and jeffrey looks off across the street from the house at the gulf
and we see the street is blockaded by mississippi state police cars
an armed camp
other men in suits lawyers and state officials wait
ron motley gets in his car and drives away
you attract a crowd
smiles wry yeah great
i heard about the kentucky gag order
i dont know what to do
and theyre quiet a breeze of the gulf ruffling their coats
he looks out at the water a cargo container ship passing by
he watches its slow progress
and jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn hands in his pockets shoulders bent head down thinking
and richard scruggs comes out tying his tie to wait beside lowell
motleys car parks and he and an assistant are approached by a flurry of media from the parking lot behind us crossing canty street to intercept him
and we see the lot is jammed with mercedes benzes town cars and limousines belonging to the big tobacco wall street lawyers
some hang out by their cars killing time
its a tailgate party
beyond them are trucks and vans with satellite dishes supporting the media circus
theyre all here for jeffs deposition
the scale of it dwarfs the plebeian storefront with its sign temporary jackson county courthouse
into which motley enters
one tobacco lawyer an edward bennett type while waiting is on his cell phone
into phone hold on a second
seeing motley enter to jr
lawyer would you please ask mr
motley if he expects his witness to appear or not
lawyer crosses to motley
jeffrey alone on the jetty looking out to sea
trying to decide trying to untangle identity and consequence
he turns crossing to lowell and scruggs
its the three men standing on the lawn
time seems to slow
all of them aware its a critical decision personally and historically
severely conflicted i cant seem to find
the criteria to decide
its too big a decision to make without being resolved
in my own mind
jeffrey getting nowhere
maybe things have changed
long pause on jeffrey as he contemplates his future
and something just got resolved
he asks lowell rhetorically
unsure you mean
since this morning
i mean since whenever
wigand looks at them
he found his own answer
lets go to court
and dick scruggs and lowell look at this normal somewhat flawed very courageous man
to unseen staff dr
wigand would like to leave now
and theres a sudden flurry of activity
jeffrey and scruggs walk to a mississippi state police car
lowell gets into his car and drives away separately
police state officials run to their cars
cars starting lights flashing wigands car pulls into position
in the back seat with scruggs
the drivers a state policeman
jeffrey watches the small town of empty lots old buildings a s deco school pass by
its all heightened especially vivid to his eyes somehow
and he exhales heavily to calm himself to focus
some of the tobacco lawyers their jackets off still hanging across canty street by their cars
and now they see the police lights turning coming around a corner moving towards the courthouse
the caravan stops
first scruggs gets out
a moment then jeffrey appears
and the reporters pounce on jeffrey cameras flashing
mississippi police leading him through the crowd
moore appears at courtroom door already there
and as hes whisked away into the courtroom
the tobacco lawyers become dead quiet
cell phones are hung up
newspapers are put away
jackets are donned
this is now very serious business
motley meets jeffrey all eyes on him
okay jeff im going to sit you down at that table over there
im going to start as fast as possible
i dont want to give them a chance to get another restraining order okay
good luck doc
motley calmly motions wigand to take a chair
he settles in
raise your right hand
do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
you may be seated
you understand dr
wigand you are under oath
this is a sworn deposition
theres no judge
its not a trial
understatement of the century will you state your name for the record
after a beat jeffrey s
he spells it for them
lowell waiting with the other journalists
got any idea whats going on in there
no i dont have a clue
motley still conducting the inquiry
and the tobacco lawyers like a pack of dogs waiting to pounce
that is correct
in other words it acts as a drug
object to the form of the question
it acts as a drug on the body
object to the form
it acts as a
there an echo in here
your objections been recorded
she typed it into her little machine over there
its on the record
so now ill proceed with my deposition of my witness
does it act as a drug
i am instructing you to wigand not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your
work at the brown williamson tobacco company
and in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the state of kentucky
that means you dont talk
motley we have rights here
explodes oh you got rights and lefts
ups and downs and middles
you dont get to instruct anything around here
this is not north carolina not south carolina nor kentucky this is the sovereign state of mississippi s proceeding
wipe that smirk off your face
wigands deposition will be part of this record
and im going to take my witness testimony
whether the hell you like it or not
to wigand answer the question dr
slams it home yes
it produces a physiological response which meets the definition of a drug
nicotine is associated with impact with satisfaction
it has a pharmacological effect that crosses the blood brain barrier intact
thank you doctor
lowell stands on the porch looking out at the rain
theres a slight sound
and jeffreys come outside
he stands leaning on the porch railing looking out at the rain and windswept trees
they share a look
they nod to each other
the smallest nod of accomplishment
and theyre there on the porch alone outside the house in pascagoula mississippi
we see lowell unusually buoyant in the same clothes as yesterday
hes working with tony baldo on a cut of the show the net result of his architecture of events his combination of persuasion and integrity
we see on the avid monitor a single of jeffrey
on monitor part of the reason im here is i felt that their representation clearly at least within
run that sandefur piece on nicotines not addictive
run that on camera
then cut right to wigand with i believe they perjured
then go wide to the ceos all taking the oath
back on jeff and play the pause after the word felt on the b side
widen to include debbie deluca the intern two other editors felling
they have gathered behind lowell in the doorway
this is a hot show and its generated excitement among lowells co workers
and while baldo cuts we see
the group has spilled out the doorway watching lowells story come together
beyond them approaching is mike wallace coming to work
leaving helluva show mike
people separate as mike pushes in
lowell sees mike
while tony baldo is making the edits on the avid
to mike it went great in mississippi mike
don hewitt enters from the corridor without jacket
i heard wigands deposition got sealed
yeah they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of kools to the world
seriously sealed doesnt hurt scruggs litigation and since were the only ones with the story i believe were sitting on an exclusive
i like that corporate has some questions
weve got a meeting at black rock first thing in the morning
whens the air date
to lowell excuse me lowell
sharons on line
tell her ill call her back in ten
here we go
baldo now runs lowells edit of the above sequence
and we sandefur in close up states i believe that nicotine is not addictive
wigand in matching close up states i believe he perjured himself
then all seven ceos of big tobacco stand up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of congress to tell the truth while wallace says
the whole line of people the whole line of ceos up there all swearing that
and wigand says off screen with great emphasis part of the reason im here is i felt
and it cuts to wigand for a pause that makes the word felt resound and then he goes on to say on camera that their representation clearly misstated what they
were a nicotine delivery business
we see the combination of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity thats stirring and beautiful
we see an anonymous rental car moving through downtown louisville
its jeffrey in the front seat driven by one of his security men
hes coming home under the cover of darkness
they pass a flaming car on the freeway shoulder
jeffrey turns to stare at it
they turn off onto city streets and stop at a light
jeffrey instinctively turns
a police car stops alongside
the policeman looks at him
jeffrey looks away
the signal takes forever
and as the police car moves off
the cars stopped at the curb
jeffrey gets out
he starts up the walk and the second security guard quickly crosses the lawn to intercept him
and jeff opens the door going inside anxious to be home
the house is quiet dark
something isnt right
he crosses to one of the childrens rooms
the master bedroom
the lights are on
both rooms are empty
he goes into the kitchen and sees a note thats been left for him
he opens it
he sits heavily in a chair reading the note
the security guard peers
and as jeffrey sits in the silent house the hero come home
were at a table
mike and lowell laugh at some joke while helen caperelli cbs general counsel enters with the president of cbs news eric kluster
shall i send for coffee
sorry im late
no no were fine
are you sure
also there is don hewitt
caperelli is too well put together too practiced too polished
they dont need coffee
alright i thought wed get together because theres a legal concept that has been getting some new attention recently tortious interference
beat if two people have an agreement like a confidentiality agreement and one of them breaks it because they are induced to do so by a rd party the rd
party can be sued for damages for interfering
hence tortious interference
thats what we do
i think what were trying to tell you is that it happens all the time
this is a news organization
people are always telling us things they shouldnt
we have to verify if its true and in the public interest
and if it is we air it
after we corroborate it
thats why weve never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show
impatient now anything else
and minutes verification is exact
and i dont think it would hurt to make sure youre right
on this one
you think we have liability
whats the cbs news position eric
theres a possibility its rather remote
but one we have to check on mike
ive retained outside counsel to do exactly that
on a segment i might add thats already rife with problems
what does that mean
im told unusual promises were made to wigand
no only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him
cuts in and im told there are questions as to our star witness veracity
trying to control his anger his veracity was good enough for the state of mississippi
historic our standards have to be higher than anyone elses because we are the standard
for everyone else
whatever that means
wry well as a standard
ill hang with is the guy telling the truth
well with tortious interference im afraid
the greater the truth the greater the damage
they own the information hes disclosing
the truer it is the greater the damage to them
if he lied he didnt disclose their information
and the damages are smaller
is this alice in wonderland
you said on this one
what about this one
and lowell hears a changed note in wallaces voice
after a beat
familiar seductive if this holds up and it very well may not mike
but if it did
and we aired this segment
and cbs was sued by brown williamson
i think we could be at grave risk
a beat how grace
and shes been waiting for this well at the end of the day
because of your segment
the brown williamson tobacco company
could own as if on cue the alarm on helen caperellis watch beeps
she glances at it
you know i am sorry
but im due upstairs
she gets up gathering her things
is cbs corporate telling cbs news do not go to air with this story
youre getting ahead of yourself
were all in this together
were all well find out soon
thank you gentlemen
and taking up her briefcase she leaves
don and mike rise
sounds like a disease caught by a radio
to mike lunch
to lowell dont worry we call the shots around here
lowell finds himself angry and alone
he crosses to the window and pulls out his cell phone and goes to work
into phone debbie its me
i want you to check some filings and give me john wilsons number at bear stern
klusters coming over
hewitts on an unrelated call
lowell crosses to look out the window a manila folder the filing under his arm with whatever he found out like a bomb feels distant from these people
the door opens and eric kluster the president of cbs news enters
hello lowell mike don
hewitt hangs up the phone
there has been so much soul searching about this wigand ive decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview
so what happened to ms
caperellis checking with outside counsel first all that crap
and hopefully we wont have to use the alternate but we should have it in the can
im not touching my film
im afraid you are
no im not
were doing this with or without you lowell
if you like i can assign another producer to edit your show
he looks like hes been hit with a hammer
since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on minutes
its an alternate version
so what if we have an alternate version
and i dont think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable
wry so now if youll excuse me gentlemen mr
rathers been complaining about his chair again
laughter as they start to leave
mild before you go
and lowell takes out
i discovered this
he gets their attention for the sale of the cbs corporation to westinghouse corporation
yeah i heard rumors
its not a rumor
its a sale
rhetorical answer if tisch can unload cbs for a share to westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion dollar lawsuit from brown williamson that could screw up the
sale could it not
serene and what are you implying
to kluster im not implying
more vested interests
reading from sec filing persons who will profit from this merger
helen caperelli general counsel of cbs news
eric kluster president of cbs news
are you suggesting that she and eric are influenced by money
oh no of course theyre not influenced by money
they work for free
and you are a volunteer executive producer
cbs does not do that
and youre questioning our journalistic integrity
no im questioning your hearing
you hear reasonable and tortious interference
potential brown williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of cbs to westinghouse
shut the segment down
cut wigand loose
and fuck off
thats what i hear
you pay me to go get guys like wigand to draw him out
to get him to trust us to get him to go on television
i deliver him
he violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement
and hes only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue maybe the biggest most expensive corporate malfeasance case in u
and jeffrey wigand whos out on a limb does he go on television and tell the truth
is it newsworthy
are we gonna air it
of course not
because hes not telling the truth
because he is telling the truth
thats why were not going to air it
and the more truth he tells the worse it gets
you are a fanatic
you know that
if we cant have a whole show then i want half a show rather than no show
but oh no not you
you wont be satisfied unless youre putting the company at risk
cmon what are you
and are you a businessman
or are you a newsman
because that happens to be what mike and i do for a living
runs on put the corporation at risk
give me a fucking break
these people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do on the line
im with don on this
and there it is
we see sharon in a vegetable garden in their side yard
she turns seeing him standing behind her
after a moment
theyre killing the wigand interview
theyre pretending its process
bullshit its foregone
beat what are you and mike going to do
im alone on this
beat oh baby
and the phone rings
sharon goes in the house to get it
she comes back out
after a beat jeffrey wigand
and we see wigand looking rough unshaven sitting on a couch in a hotel room
and we see his belongings clothing some boxes a bottle of vodka his computer whats left of his world are around the room
jeffrey how are you
hows the family okay
there is there is no family
what do you mean there is no family
liane has filed for divorce
and lowells dead quiet
and so i moved out
i see the girls a couple of days a week
concerned where you staying now
sarcastic our favorite hotel honey
i checked into room
and we dont know what he means by that
the last of the daylight shadows his office
after a beat i dont know how to say this jeff except to just say it right out so ill say it
they do not want to air it
b w may have threatened litigation
cbs is on the block
a beat but you i mean i know how
i do not think that you know for me
what it is to walk in my shoes
beat for my kids to have seen it
for them to know why ive put them through what i did
the public airing of that
the testament to why i did what i did
youre telling me is not going to see the light of day
and jeffrey starts to hang up
and jeffrey hangs up
jeffrey silently sitting in the chair
we come around and see why hes been purposely sitting there
why hes chosen this room
directly across the street is the brown williamson building
the lights are on
the building lit up
and in an upstairs office brown williamson lawyers moving around a conference room talking
and as jeffrey looks out the window
a peaceful suburban street
a private investigator p
from igi in a raincoat getting out of a car going up the walk
he knocks on the door
a woman in her late forties handicapped in an electric cart answers the door
it hasnt been mrs
wigand for some time
well im an investigator and i was i was wondering if i could ask you a couple of questions about that
and on a television screen susan wigand the woman in the electric cart giving a taped interview to the p
seven months after we were married we found out that i had multiple sclerosis
we pull back to see john scanlon and his staff watching the tape
his firms logo public relations campaigns for some of his high profile clients are on the walls
scanlons on the phone talking with somebody as the tape runs
on television and you had a daughter diane with him is that correct
on television yes in
on the phone whispering come on tommy sandefur told me himself hes not gonna allow brown williamson to be demonized to the american public so i told peter jennings and
he stops listening to the videotape
on television would it be fair to say when he divorced you he left you in a precarious situation
you had multiple sclerosis you had a small child to raise
ignoring that part to staff mention that part in the executive summary and in the chapters first wife and estrangement of daughter
beat into phone so i was telling pete i said youve been taken in by this guy
on television yes
beat but you have to understand the divorce was something that we both wanted
hes a total bullshit artist
hes a shoplifter
hes a convicted shoplifter
and as we end in a sea of documents affidavits court records all from louisville all about jeffrey
we understand the war has only been begun
lowell in his office his door open for anyone to see him an immovable force sitting behind his desk
hewitt appears in his doorway
after a beat cold so what are you going to do
well what do you think im going to do
quit in protest
im not going to do that
surprised youre taking no for an answer
im not going to take no for an answer
then what are you going to do
hewitt looks at him
im staying right here
doing my job
fighting to get my show on the air
you dont like it
hey ill tell you what
fire my ass
end up in a high profile lawsuit with lowell the first amendment martyr
i dont think so
laughs take a look at this
this is a summary of a dossier thats being prepared
and he gives him a copy of it
he would lie about his whole life
whos going to believe him about anything he says
a beat and the coup de grace the wall street journal s doing a major story and i think the post you backed the wrong horse
he turns and starts off along the hall
as he goes
don hewitt contd his parting shot the version without his interview is going to air the week after next
lowell watches him walk away
what was that about
get me wigand
fuck is this
on the phone upset you never told me you were married before
that you had a daughter
and wigand is in the phone booth at the high school
students walking by
outraged well how is that any of your business
that is not something that you people need to know
his voice carries a student looks over
frustrated oh you know what we do or do not need to know
since when have you become a media expert
upset what do you want to do lowell look up my ass too
and he realizes hes said it too loud a couple of passing students stop looking at him
oh my god
after a beat lowering his voice but contentious youre not even on this anymore
what do you care
wake the fuck up
everybody is on the line here
if they can catch you in a lie they can paint everything with that brush
do you understand
everything you say
i told the truth
say and i cant defend you man with one hand tied behind my back
because you keep from me
what they can discover
and they will discover everything
he looks out the phone booth
after some moments
meaning his first wife and their child upset i was young
i was young
we didnt handle it the right way
after a beat she sued you for back payments of child support
she did not sue me
we had a dispute over money
i settled it she dropped the complaint
angry any other questions
and well go back and forth
did you lie about being on the american judo team in the olympics
some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview
where youre saying you were on the american judo team in the olympics
explosive what kind of shit is this
i was not on the team i sparred with the olympic team
and we see unbeknownst to wigand the p
in the raincoat who interviewed his ex wife coming out of an administration office walking towards us along the hallways
the abc telemarketing company
abc telemarketing company
the absurdity a can opener
i cancelled payment
it was junk
sarcastic you ever bounce a check lowell
you ever look at another womans tits
you ever cheat a little on your taxes
a beat angry whose life if you look at it under a microscope doesnt have any flaws
in the raincoat passes jeffrey now and doesnt even glance at him
thats the whole point jeffrey
thats the whole point
they are gonna look under every rock dig up every flaw every mistake youve ever made
they are going to distort and exaggerate everything youve ever done man
dont you understand
shouts what does this have to do with my testimony
thats not the point
what does this have to do with my testimony
i told the truth
its valid and true and provable
thats not the fucking point whether you told the truth or not
i told the truth
i told the truth
and wigands quiet a deep dark depression
the school bell ring snaps him out of it
after a beat ive got to teach class
ive got to go
ive got to teach class
undaunted and ive got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before the wall street journal runs
a beat i am trying to protect you man
after a beat the killer well i hope you improve your batting average
and he slams the phone down
and as he stands in the phone booth like a man in a glass booth all alone
on the door to the roof
it slams open
an enraged lowell enters and walks out into the cold rain
like a prize fighter shoulders hunched against the cold he buries his hands in his jacket pockets
he crosses to the edge of the roof high above the city
hes pissed off
he takes out his cell phone
lowell hears background noise
twenty sub editors and section heads sit and stand in a clear area
one of them a large man is charlie phillips on a cell phone
cautious its lowell
are you guys planning to do a piece on a former top executive in big tobacco
you caught me in a news meeting
well are you or are you not charlie
you bet we are
and i cant talk to you now
we gotta hook up
ill be there
a busy new york street
and we see lowell is on the phone in a phone booth
yeah i got it
pages of it
they looked in every corner of this guys life
from a spousal abuse charge to shoplifting to a traffic ticket he got once for running a red light
its terry lenzners outfit igi
jack listen to me
their strategy discredit this guy ruin his reputation in the wall street journal and then nobody will ever listen to what hes got to say about tobacco
unless i can get this thing knocked down
a townhouse with a commanding view of the bay
and we see a broad shouldered man in his late forties sitting at a desk on the phone
his wife sandra sutherland sitting across from him on another phone
theyre private investigators
to make it even a little more attractive i dont know if youre ever gonna get paid
is there any truth to any of it
thats a good question
is there any truth to any of it
i doubt it
whats their deadline
palladinos exchange looks she nods
fax me the summary
thats great jack
lowell hangs up and walks towards us to enter
close on lowell entering moving through the crowd of sports writers feature writers sub editors etc
he comes upon a rugged featured man jim cooper from the new york times sitting next to charlie
how are you jim
hey listen i hear you guys are sitting on something sensational over there
lowell looks at cooper quizzically
just then jims wife enters
they exchange greetings
catch you later
cooper and his wife leave
charlie and lowell are alone in the crowded bar
whens your deadline
its a smear campaign charlie
its drawn from a selectively circulated
cuts in oh its real selective
about as hard to get a hold of as the manhattan phone book
well its authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented
and its bullshit
and if im right are you going to put the journal s reputation behind a story thats going to blow up in your face
ill take a look at what you got
but im not moving any deadlines cause you say so
thats the way it lays
in a different personal tone
charlie phillips contd are you all right
catch you later
and we see a policeman sitting at the counter having a cup of coffee
he turns as sandra sutherland sits at the counter to the left of him
sandra sutherland contd officer muravchick
how are you
im sandra sutherland
how do you do
fine thank you
im doing a background check
mind if i sit down
an older man is on the bench
hes just recessed his court
as everybody streams out going against the tide is jack palladino
he approaches the judge crossing to a side door
your honor could i have a word with you
you presided in a dispute over support payments
yeah i cited him
on monitor cbs is under criticism because the cbs news program minutes will not be presenting an interview
lowells destroying his own work product taking apart his creation that we saw earlier to be so impactful
tony gets a call as hewitt enters
what the hell are you doing
what does it look like im doing
no not that
im talking about the associated press
they got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to mike and i
did you tell them that we were lying
i should have
i told them i disagreed with you mike and kluster that this segment is as good as the original
im not lying for you
im not gonna shut up for you
not on any of it
im not going to fire you okay
take a vacation
a suitcase is on the floor
lowell finishing packing up his things from his office
i decided to preface sundays show
i did three minutes on the evening news
youll want to see it
beat where you going
and he sees wallace has stopped at his door
ive been banished
in lieu of being fired
disinterested i took off on tisch
i took off on corporate
theyll know theyre not going to see everything on sunday night
i dont know
how does that get wigand on the air
goes up do me a favor will you

to force it on the air
the answer is no
i dont plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of national public radio
beat that decision ive already made
from corridor to mike it just started mike
wallace waves lowells remark aside and exits
we dwell on lowell until he exits
into the hall
dan rather introduced mike
as lowell exits we see hewitt kluster and caperelli outside of hewitts office watching
lowell disgusted takes a cursory look and moves towards the elevator but he hears
wheres the rest
where the hells the rest
lowell turns to see wallace shouting up at the monitors in disbelief
you cut it
you cut the guts out of what said wallace moves in on kluster
it was a time consideration mike
you corporate lackey
who told you your incompetent little fingers had the requisite skills to edit me
im trying to band aid a situation here and youre too dim to
interrupts familiar mike
it was a big mistake
now he turns on her
zeroing in getting closer
we work in the same corporation doesnt mean we work in the same profession
what are you gonna do now
you gonna finesse me
lawyer me some more
ive been in this profession fifty fucking years
you and the people you work for are destroying the most respected the highest rated the most profitable show on this network
a range rover pulls up
charlie phillips gets out
he crosses to lowell whos been waiting by his own taxi
he hands charlie a folder with the brown notebook inside that is the partially complete palladino sutherland lowell work product
these are their leads their sources
i want you to have your reporters
suein hwang and milo geyelin
have them make their own calls
theyll find that these sources have a different story than the one thats in the dossier
demands push the deadline charlie
charlie starts looking through the palladino sutherland lowell work product
ill push it for a week
let milo and suein go through it
what do you want to buy him for a gift
hes into kind of little cars that
that remote control thing
alright well do that tomorrow
theres dad on tv
and we see jeffrey in a quiet bar
the televisions on the sound low the midday news
as jeffrey looks up and sees his photograph on television
in his local world the impact is and in local news wlko louisville has gained access to a five hundred page dossier on former brown williamson research head jeffrey wigand
detailing charges of spousal abuse shoplifting
and jeffrey looks as if something just detonated inside of him
and jeffrey sitting alone in the hotel watching the show
thousands of documents from inside the tobacco industry have surfaced over the past year documents that appear to confirm what a former
and as we look at jeffreys face set in stone
us surgeon general and the current head of the food and drug administration have been saying
we learned of
and don hewitt in his house in the hamptons alone in his bedroom watching the show
a tobacco insider who could tell us whether or not the tobacco industry has been leveling with the public
that insider was formerly a highly placed executive with a tobacco company
but we cannot broadcast what critical information about tobacco addiction and public health he might be able to offer
because he had to sign a confidentiality agreement with the tobacco company he worked for
mike wallace is in his study watching the show alone
as we slowly move in on mike seeing himself on television
on minutes the management of cbs has told us that knowing he had that agreement
and the look on his face says he does not like this
lowell silently watching the broadcast
if were to broadcast an interview with him cbs could be faced with a multibillion dollar lawsuit
jeffrey watching the show
on minutes from the interview with wigand
the fact is we are not allowed even to mention his name or the name of the company he worked for and of course we cannot show you his face
and your confidentiality agreement with
blip is still in force
and all we can hear is an electronically altered voice and the blanked out image of a man
yes it is
on minutes so what are they gonna do
sue you for making this appearance
i would bet on it
on minutes the former executive has reason to bet on being sued for major cigarette manufacturers
a man no longer with a face or a voice and as he gets up and quietly turns off the television
wallace hasnt moved still in his chair
he stares ignoring the cbs programming on the phone making a call
lowell walking up the sand his cell phone rings
you disappeared on me
how long you staying
absurd i disappeared on you
meaning the show alright
what did you think
after a beat i think it was a disgrace
the look on wallaces face says he thinks so too
he hangs up the phone
lowell is on the phone now
the moon lights the water the empty beach
he listens as a phone through static rings and rings and rings
and we hear the phone ringing
we slowly pan across the hotel room
we see on the floor a pair of mens tasseled loafers
a discarded sport jacket
and we see jeffrey barefoot sitting in a chair in the center of the room
hes looking out the window at b w
the curtains are blowing
and hes still
the sound of the phone ringing and sir theres still no answer in that room
get me the managers office
david youve got a call on line
i think you better take it
a thin man answers the phone
this is david macdougal
how can i help you
macdougal my name is lowell bergman
im a producer for minutes
im concerned with a friend of mine whos staying at your hotel right now
and we see the hotel manager walking along with a security guard and now on jeffreys door
and when there is no response the manager nods to the security guard the guard using a pass key unlocking the door
but the door stops the chain lock drawn
the manager looks in through the chain
and he can see jeffrey sitting in the chair
the manager quickly takes a cell phone from the security guard
lowell standing on the beach anxiously waiting
upset i think i need to call the police
he wont respond
dont call the police
urgent just tell him im on the phone with you
my name is lowell bergman
just tell him that
through the door frightened mr
bergman is on the telephone
did he hear you
youre breaking up
i cant hear you
lowell goes deeper into the water
what about now
hello can you hear me now
and now the walls behind morph into a green daytime garden the garden behind his house
and as we dolly around wigand more walls morph into the side yard and turning slowly he sees barbara and deborah in the emerald green grass
they stop and smile then they stare at us at their father
and he looks at his children at an idyll lost
the chair the man are the only real objects left in the view from inside his head
lowell anxiously moves along the beach trying to be heard the phone chattering with static
alarmed whats happening
afraid he doesnt seem to be listening
on the cell phone shouts urgent alright now listen to me
i want you i want you to tell him in these words get on the fucking phone
i cant say that
no you can
tell him to get on the fucking phone
at the door to jeffrey loud he told me to tell you to get on
the fucking phone
and even hes surprised by his language
and suddenly jeffrey gets up unlatches the door grabs the phone from the hotel manager
wigand in the hotel corridor lowell standing knee deep in the water
on the phone angry you manipulated me into this
thats bullshit jeff
you greased the rails
i greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes
i helped him to say yes
youre not a robot jeff
you got a mind of your own dont you
running on up to you jeffrey
thats the power you have jeffrey
vital insider information the american public need to know
lowell bergman the hot show who never met a source he couldnt turn around
running on i fought for you
and i still fight for you
you fought for me
running on you manipulated me
into where i am now
staring at the brown williamson building
its all dark
except the th floor
thats the legal department
thats where they fuck with my life
beat jeffrey where you going with this
so where you goin
quiet you are important to a lot of people jeffrey
you think about that
you think about them
close on jeffrey standing in the room with the blowing curtains
im running out of heroes man
after a beat guys like you are in short supply
and for the first time wigand smiles
a beat wry yeah guys like you too
and the grave situation passes
after a beat where are you anyway
im on a leave of absence
a rare laugh his sarcasm you try and have a good time
yeah i will
sharons cooking across the room
and theres just the sound of the ceiling fan turning
im lowell bergman im from minutes
you know you take the minutes out of that sentence nobody returns your phone call
maybe wigands right
maybe im hooked
what am i hooked on
what the hell for
its so fucking useless all of it
a beat so its a big country with a free press
you can go work somewhere else
press is free
for anyone who owns one
larry tisch has a free press
get some perspective lowell
i got perspective
no you do not
from my perspective whats been going on and what ive been doing is ridiculous
its half measures
youre not listening
beat really know what youre going to do before you do it
and as the fan squeaks turning
lowell stares at sharon
between two curved colonnades of snow covered trees drives a rental car
closer its lowell
his pov spots a dirty suv and he pulls into park across from a coffee shop in this out of context mountain town
his pager beeps
he looks at it
he detours from the coffee shop to a pay phone on the corner of the moose lodge
ive got richard scruggs on the phone
patch him through
well lowell you are not going to believe this
and we see the back of a crowded courtroom
richard scruggs is standing in the rear amongst bailiffs an witnesses talking on his own cell phone
the governor of mississippi is suing his own attorney general
to abandon litigation against big tobacco
waiting media are relaxing as scruggs continues to lowell
after a beat but now that the version without jeff ran
whats the chance of getting his interview on the air
scruggs now exits the building past the metal detector seeking better reception
yeah im here
what chance is there of getting jeffs interview on the air
droll less than great
and the courthouse doors suddenly burst open michael moore and his attorneys coming out
scruggs comes further down the steps so he can hear away from michael moore who begins answering questions from the press
after a beat id be lying to you if i did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion
a beat and id be lying to you if i didnt tell you im about out of moves dick
lowell walks right in and up to a booth and a couple in hiking pants and hiking boots
they look up at him
so what are you folks doing here in lincoln
and we sense something is all wrong here
affable geology survey
how about you
direct i work for cbs news
after a beat oh yeah
they look at each other and they both know theres a lot more than meets the eye
and as lowell gets up and leaves
and we see lowell on the pay phone again
just ran into two of your geologists
geologists whose hands arent all chewed up
and we see bill robertsons on the phone
do not screw this up
we are a week away from an arrest
so ill hold it
on the phone well give you a heads up before we launch
you got a deal
hangs up lowell is in a t shirt and sweat pants sitting in an old re upholstered one too many times chair in a room barely big enough for a
chair a bed and the tv vcr combo on the cheap dresser
its playing lowells cut of the full wigand interview
he watches the show that will never see the light of day
like the testimony before congress of dr
wigands former boss brown williamsons chief executive officer thomas sandefur
in close up i believe that nicotine is not addictive
in matching close up i believe mr
sandefur perjured himself
because i watched those testimonies very carefully
then it cuts to all seven ceos of big tobacco raising their hands and taking the oath in front of congress to tell the truth while
all of us did
there was this whole like of people the whole line of ceos up there all swearing that
part of the reason im here is i and the pause after the word makes felt resound and as it cuts to jeffrey on camera saying
that their representation
and lowell freezes after the image
he gets up looking out the window through the curtain with the spill from the neon motel sign
outside are horse trailers
he goes back to watching the show
in touch with his own creative work product and the ideas inherent in it in this decision making process that we feel is critical to him
turning he dials the phone and we intercut with
jim its lowell
where are you
doesnt answer remember that night at p
you asked me if we were sitting on something explosive
beat well were not sitting on it
beat cbs corporate leaned on cbs news which yanked an interview we did with a top ranking tobacco scientist
a corporate officer
they are trying to close down the story
sarcastic you mean minutes is letting cbs corporate decide what is or is not news
beat whats wallace think about this or hewitt or
what kind of placement
oh cmon lowell
this is the new york times i dont know
well until you do all i can tell you is what you already know
they will not air an interview
call me back in ten
lowell hangs up
debbie answers intercutting with above
what time is it
oh its late
that i know
when are you coming back
i cant get out of here til mid morning
ill be in tomorrow night
beat listen could you call a number for me its in mississippi
hold on a second
what is it
jim coopers workstation
his phone rings
he grabs it
heres how it works
you ask me questions
i tell you if youre wrong okay
youre sure you want to do this
hey it doesnt work
youve burned your bridges man
about this whistle blower
did mike and don go along with the corporate decision
jim coopers voice over contd lowell
did i tell you you were wrong
beat im assuming the cave in begins with the threat of litigation from big tobacco
are we talking
are we talking brown williamson here
moving closer into the face of lowell
his gaze falters
his eyes go back to the motel tv mutely frozen on the show
whatever hes seeing there his gaze is steadfast
newspaper box is loaded with the new york times cab pulls to curb and a raincoated man emerges
we see he carries a copy of this mornings new york times a suitcase is half unpacked on the floor
a sleeping figure
theres a knock
irritated a sleeping lowell gets up to answer it
he looks through the security peep hole
he opens it
and mike wallace a newspaper under his arm is standing in the doorway
did i get you up
no i usually sit around in my hotel room dressed like this at in the morning sleepy look on my face
theres an awkward quiet
he slows looks around
how many shows have we done
cmon how many
yeah thats right
but in all that time mike did you ever get off a plane walk into a room and find that a source for a story changed his mind
lost his heart
walked out on us
not one fucking time
you want to know why
i see a rhetorical question on the horizon
im going to tell you why
because when i tell someone im going to do something i deliver
oh how fortunate i am to have lowell bergmans moral tutelage to point me down the shining path
to show me the way
oh please mike
beat give me a break
no you give me a break
i never left a source hung out to dry ever
not til right fucking now
when i came on this job i came with my word intact
im gonna leave with my word intact
fuck the rules of the game
hell youre supposed to know me mike
what the hell did you expect
you expect me to lie down
what get over it
in the real world when you get to where i am there are other considerations
what are we talking celebrity here
im not talking celebrity vanity cbs
im talking about when youre nearer the end of your life than the beginning
now what do you think you think about then
in the future im going to do this
what you think is how will i be regarded in the end
after im gone
he trails off
they look at each other
mike wallace contd now along the way i suppose i made some minor impact
beat i did iran gate and the ayatollah malcolm x martin luther king saddam sadat etcetera etcetera
i showed them thieves in suits
beat ive spent a lifetime building all that
but history only remembers most what you did last
and should that be fronting a segment that allowed a tobacco giant to crash this network
beat does it give someone at my time of life pause
and the look on wallaces face is it did
whether it should or should not
what difference does that make
and we realize only now that he has not come to argue
low you and i have been doing this together for fourteen years and he gives lowell a copy of the new york times mike wallace contd this is todays new
york times beat in it is the whole sordid story of what went on inside our shop
lowell looks down at the page
the headline is minutes mike wallace contd and in the editorial
it accuses us
of betraying the legacy of edward r
turning he walks out and down the hallway
lowell looks at the newspaper
the helicopter approaching manhattan
john scanlon sitting with hewitt both of them reading the wall street journal wigand article
troubled they conclude most of it seems pretty unsubstantiated
looking at him sickened youre full of shit john
lowell at a table littered with new york times new york daily news etc
his phone rings
broadway backgrounds streak past debbie delucas head as she rides talking on a cell phone the wall street journal in her hand
theres a picture of wigand
articles entitled getting personal by lined to suein hwang and milo geyelin
wait hold on a second lowell
debbie hits call waiting
debbie deluca contd yeah
ill see if i can find him
beat to lowell yeah dons looking for you
the sub heading is brown williamson has a page dossier attacking chief critic
it quotes richard scruggs calling it the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle blower
extremely close lowell
a close look at the file and independent research by this newspaper into its key claims indicates that many of the serious allegations against mr
wigand are backed by scant or contradictory evidence
as lowell hails a cab in a wide angle and runs towards us jumping into the cab
the news division has been vilified in the new york times in print on television for caving to corporate interests
we pull back and we see that lowells with hewitt in hewitts office
the new york times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors
you fucked us
shouting no you fucked you dont invert stuff
big tobacco tried to smear wigand you bought it
the wall street journal here not exactly a bastion of anti capitalist sentiment refutes big tobaccos smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination
and now even now when every word of what wigand has said on our show is printed the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the
state of mississippi the cat totally out of the bag youre still standing here debating
don what the hell else
do you need
and hewitt looking around
mike you tell him
simply you fucked up don
and dons taken off stride
recovers fast hey its old news
stick with me
like always well be okay
these things have a half life of fifteen minutes
no thats fame
fame has a fifteen minute half life
lasts a little longer
lowell looks at wallace
its simply dead wrong
in his face so theres no doubt now this is what were going to do
were going over to black rock
jeff is in front of his class teaching
okay so lets get back to it
alright now what we saw there was
tired his suitcase at his feet
we dont know if hes coming or going
hes at a pay phone in the more deserted than not airport
into phone they cancelled the six oclock
beat i dont know why
im on the
i should be home
ill see you then
he hangs up and ambles over to a lounge with a few travellers sitting in it
cbs management wouldnt let us broadcast our original story and our interview with wigand because they were worried about the possibility of a multi billion dollar lawsuit against us for
but now things have changed
a small apartment
jeffrey dishes out second helpings of pasta primavera into two pasta plates and brings them into the kitchenette to his girls deborah and barbara
and now we see and hear the small television on the table playing minutes and
in my opinion is an industry that has perpetrated the biggest fraud on the american public in history
deborah looks proudly at her father
wigands gotten up and gone out of the kitchenette
he has stopped for a moment around the corner in the hallway
his kids cant see him
and he watches them and his eyes get shiny and start to tear
and as he stands there watching his girls at the kitchen table witnessing their fathers hard earned truth on television we realize that of all the audiences his girls are
the one he cares about most
and lowell in his moment of victory is watching his minutes double segment on a departure lounge television with his feet resting on his suitcase next to a chicano woman
with two kids and her mother and an older man with a beard and cane
an airport cleaner stops to watch too
lowell glances at him
unbeknownst to these viewers arrested by the content on the television screen is that the man who made it sits casually among them watching his work
sharon sits at the kitchen table
she watches in a far corner a small countertop television
its minutes the full show entitled jeffrey wigand ph
and on the top right produced by lowell bergman
as sharon continues watching the television playing on the counter the emotional currents within her remaining unrevealed
watching the show
he sees himself
to wigand you wish you hadnt blown the whistle
on television hesitating there are times
i wish i hadnt done it
but there are times that i feel compelled to do it
ive if you asked me if i would do it again or if its do i think its worth it
i think its worth it
wallace satisfied rises to refill his glass as
lowell watching show in airport
and we see the fbi agent bill robertson on the phone
i promised you a three hour heads up
well here it is
have a camera crew standing by in helena montana on tuesday and ill give you a three hour head start
by the way that was a hell of a good show tonight
nods trustworthy thank you bill
and he quietly hangs up
and its still
sharons laid down closing her eyes
they lie close together
after some moments she opens her eyes and lets us know what shes been thinking
understated you won
this time he isnt droll
a beat what did i win
theres an odd look on his face not the look of a victor
he shuts off the light
and as they lie close together in the dark in each others arms
lowell entering through machine rooms into a state of the art master control room
on a wall are fifty or more monitors in the humidity and temperature controlled nexus of cbs operations
and its jammed with people witnessing a fast breaking major news event
mike wallace stands near felling
lowell crosses past felling and stands next to mike wallace
and we see footage of a handcuffed bearded barefoot man
theodore kaczynski the unabomber being taken in by the fbi
a director counts down
dan rather launches
reporting from cbs world news headquarters in new york good afternoon
there has been a major break in the case of the so called unabomber
cbs news has learned that a remote homesite outside lincoln montana has been under fbi surveillance
thanks for this
you know we beat everybody
abc nbc cnn
mike motions lowell out into the corridor so they can be alone
the control room and crowd are seen through the glass wall
after some moments that canada story
still interest you
nods everything interests me
lowell puts his hands in his jacket pockets
after some moments
i quit mike
lowell shakes his head no
cmon it all worked out
you came out okay in the end
what do i tell a source on the next tough story
hang in with us
youll be fine
they look at each other
lowell says to mike intimately what he knows mike knows
lowell contd what got broken here
doesnt go back together again
lowells heartfelt regret
he starts to leave
they look at each other
lowell contd so uh
and lowell moves off along the hallway the monitors all showing cbs programming
he doesnt even look back
