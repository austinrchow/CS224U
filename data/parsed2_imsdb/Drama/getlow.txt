gaby mitchell from a distance and through the trees we see a raging hell fire engulfing a small two story house
it burns and burns
out of nowhere a man bursts through a second story window lands hard and rolls to smother his burning clothes
he crawls away and staggers up and for a moment looks as if he might run back into the flames
but the heat is unbearable
he runs toward us then past us through black shadows
we cannot see his face glass in a weathered window glitters with early morning sun
a rock shatters one of the remaining glass panes
the rock thrower tom is hightailing it away from an isolated appalachian shack as the door bangs open a shotgun barrel appears and a chicken comes squawking out from under
thinking hes sure to be shot tom runs into the old barn
panting in terror tom is hunkered down in strips of light trying to see through the cracks
there is a loud snort and the huge face of some kind of beast suddenly appears at his shoulder
tom jumps panicked just as a shadowy figure creeps into the barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him
tom freezes bends over and throws up
when tom looks up a ray of light reveals the half face of a fierce gray bearded man felix bush
he is holding out a handkerchief to the boy
shaking hard tom hesitates then takes it and wipes his mouth
bush pushes open the door and gives tom a sad look that the boy will never forget before waving him away
looking back over his shoulder tom runs for the road
two of his buddies are already kicking up dust
bush steps into the sun and watches the boy run off with a look of muted anger sadness and something much deeper
bush enters the barn to check on his companion
mule is older than bush in mule years and just as gray
he wears an old mule blanket everywhere to keep out the cold
he fidgets nervously from all the excitement
bush comforts him
just a boy thats all
bush rips down an old faded sign at the road and posts a fresh one no damn trespassing beware of mule
bush checks the road in both directions
all clear for now
bush splits firewood with powerful cleaving strokes
mule dozes in the shade
bush sees a model t approach and turn into his road right past his new sign
he glances at his shotgun leaning against the shack
the model t comes to a shaky stop
a man climbs out sees bush swinging the axe and approaches with trepidation
hard life if you cant read
im uh reverend gus horton sir how you doing
bush stops his swing and turns and stares coldly at horton
dont need saving preacher
uh well mr
wiley starke has passed on sir
his funeral is tomorrow and i thought you might want to know since
what got him
just got old sir
bush returns to chopping wood
feeling awkward horton hesitates starts for his car stops
starke told me that you and him ran away from home when you were years old
is that true
i talked him into it
bush doesnt turn just keeps chopping
horton shrugs get in his car and leaves
bush strikes the log hard and a cleaved piece goes flying
the loneliness of the empty cemetery is broken by wiley starkes fresh grave
the mounded earth is covered with beautiful flowers and wreathes a loving send off from his family and friends
as we pan past the flowers and cards
we realize that the cemetery is not quite empty
hunkered down nearby bush is as still as a gravestone staring at the last resting place of his old friend
as bush gets up to leave he stops abruptly and stands frozen staring at a pot of yellow flowers on a distant grave
now he turns and walks quickly away in the opposite direction
rain drums hard on the tin roof as bush soaked to the bone and shaking with chills rummages through an old hat box by lamp light letters news clippings and
he finds what hes looking for a picture of a beautiful young woman
she smiles at us from happier days
realizing that he is raging with a serious fever he tries to stand up only to collapse back on the bed
wrapped in his quilt and carrying the oil lamp bush moves slowly toward the barn
but he is so wracked with fever he has to stop
it stuns him that he cant go on
he never thought anything could stop him
stuck in the rain with the shaking lamp sizzling he stares into the forever darkness the muscles in his jaw rippling in the pale light
somehow he has made it
sopping wet and shivering bush is in bad shape and knows it
mule sees bush and grunts anxiously as he rises
bush blindly pours mule some feed and the poor old thing snatches his first meal in days
bush tries to think through the fever
he stumbles back to the door and swings it wide open so mule can get out if bush doesnt make it
satisfied he comes back and drops hard onto a pile of hay near mule
always thought youd go first
white as cotton bush stares into the lamp that is running out of oil the light fading fast to darkness
thoughts tumble through his mind troubling him stirring the dark waters of memory
pan across the stillness of the foothills to the barn
the door is still swung wide open
back from the brink of death bush emerges into the blinding sunlight
mule is dozing in his favorite spot
he swings his big gray head over at bush
ahh dont look so disappointed
mule watches bush heave a creaky old wagon out from behind the barn
mule climbs up on all fours
bush gets a set of reins and walks toward him
mule starts to take a stroll knowing what the reins mean
you better not
mule looks back sees an apple in bushs hand and stops
and coffee when we get there
old wheels creak and moan
bush and mule ease up main street with the cart
people try to catch a glimpse of the infamous recluse
mule comes to a wearied stop breathing hard
bush climbs off the cart and walks mule ignoring the eyes upon him
reverend horton stoking the wood stove hears footsteps
but as he turns he sees bush silently looking around
horton comes to bush but bush ignores him and keeps critically looking around
what can i do for you sir
suddenly buddy and kathryn robinson s enter from the vestibule with their new baby
in their own world and not realizing that there is anyone in the chapel kathryn picks some lint from buddys jacket
he catches her fingers and kisses them
bush is transfixed by the loving moment
i can wait
buddy and kathryn see horton and double take bush
buddy nods to horton and he and kathryn step back into the vestibule to give bush and horton privacy
its alright have a seat
bush sits down uneasily in a pew
horton sits down in the pew in front of him and twists around to face him
the wintry light from the near window washes over them
whats on your mind sir
bout time for me to get low
down to business bush reaches into his overalls and puts a balled up wad of money on the pew
hortons eyes bulge
need a funeral
horton looks up from the money
buddy peers around from the vestibule listening curious as hell until kathryn pulls him back
off bushs impatient nod you want to buy a funeral for you
am i not talking right
no yes im sorry
are you sick sir
i dont take care of my bones it wont get done will it
all right i see
well the church can help you get your affairs in order arrange a service
horton glances at the strange wad of money again
what would you say
what do you want me to say
say what youd say right now to my face
i uh i dont know much about you mr
i mean ive heard stories but
bush leans in and stares into horton
it feels like everything in the world stops dead
buddy peeks in again this time kathryn peeks too
off bushs intense look you know people talking
what kind of stories
my mother used to say that gossip is the devils radio
not that she didnt play that radio at full volume now and then bless her heart but
back to business what matters when you come to the end of your life is that youre ready for the next one
have you made peace with god sir
horton has no idea what bush means
he looks at the money back at bush
you cant buy forgiveness mr
but you do have to ask for it
nothing in this world is free preacher
bush abruptly grabs his money and starts out
his hand bangs into the pew and the money falls
buddy stares wild eyed at the big wad of money then drops back into the vestibule
bush storms past buddy kathryn and the baby like a hot wind
bush heads off down the road on his wagon
horton buddy and kathryn appear at the door and watch him go
that was uh different
i heard such awful things about him when i was a kid
my mother probably told you some of them
kathryn goes back into the church with horton who is cooing at the baby
buddy lingers staring at bush thinking
bushs wagon loaded with bags of feed and supplies sits in front of the diner
bush is holding a big tin cup of coffee for mule who is drinking it and loving it
tom the kid who threw the rock comes from behind the diner with a full garbage can to empty into the big trash barrels on the back of an old
pick up truck
he sees bush and freezes
bush looks up and stares at him
the diner door snaps open and bonnie s toms mother steps out
she sees tom and bush staring at each other
what are you doing son
now tom is scared to death that bush is going to tell on him
bonnie doesnt like this staring match at all
empty those cans in your daddys truck and get back in here
finally bush drops his gaze and lets tom off the hook
relieved tom heaves the can up into the truck
bonnie hesitates then goes back into the diner just as
carl s his sidekick gary and two other men come across the street toward the diner
gary sees mule slurping coffee from the big tin cup
look at that
a mule drinking coffee
finally found somebody that likes bonnies coffee
as they move past they see bush standing there
yall better hush thats old bush
carl eyes him
gary and the others throw curious glances as they head into the diner
im talking to you
carl picks up a handful of gravel tosses some over nonchalantly in bushs direction
bush ignores it
we know about you
you stay out of this diner
theres women and children here and we dont want you around them
bush stands to mount up never turning around
you better hear me
i see you here again ill
hearing the hollering tom looks up from the pick up
carl throws a stone harder this time to get bushs attention
but the rock misses bush and hits mule startling him
old instincts kick in and he has a violent fit
carl moves up to try and calm him
as bush tries to ease mule down the cart hitch grinds a gash in mules hind quarter
mule whinnies painfully slowly surrendering
as carl steps up bush yanks the brake handle off the cart and hits carl in the chest
air explodes from carl as he gasps with pain
before he can move bush hits him again in the same place
carl wants to hit back but he has no air
lightning quick bush steps back and hits carl again in the exact same place
carl falls like a bag of bones
he looks up and sees bush towering over him with a terrible bottled up darkness in him
it has all happened so fast it feels like an awful dream to carl
wild with fear bonnie and tom run toward bush
gary the worker burst from the diner but see the brake handle in bushs hand and slow down
bush comes to himself sees everyone staring sees carl in tears and now tom and bonnie trying to get him away
gary and the others slowly move toward bush
more patrons step out from the diner
buddy races up sees mule bleeding and eyes bush as he grabs the reins and leads mule down main street still holding the brake handle
ill kill him
bonnie shushes him softly as carl moans in pain
tom stares after bush mirroring his fathers hatred
an empty casket awaits its passenger in a small but serviceable funeral hall
through the office door frank quinn sits at his desk his head completely buried behind a paper that he shakes hard every few seconds
his feet are up on the desk revealing a pair of lovely burgundy silk socks
franks hand slips the flask next to his coffee cup into a drawer when he hears the front door open
but his face remains hidden as buddy enters
buddy is troubled by the fight
off franks grunt there was a fight
let me guess
well yeah but this time it was with that old man bush
is there a body
no the old man did the beating
never seen anything like it
social event of the year and i missed it
frank lowers the paper so just his eyes appear
he has no southern accent and doesnt look small town
read the paper today
off buddys no something strange is happening in the world right now
people are dying in bunches
off buddys look everywhere
he puts the paper down and studies his socks
i wonder what the odds are of a funeral home going broke
i mean you have a business everybody on earth needs you cant make that work its got to be you right
i dont know
what do you do when people wont die
onethingabout chicago people knowhowto die they drown get runover shot whatever it takes
we get it done down here were just not in a hurry about it
its them or us
frank sighs and stares forlornly out at a casket
i might know someone who is looking for a funeral
franks eyes crawl over to him
the quinn funeral home packard hearse makes it way down the road
frank drives as buddy searches ahead
how much did he have
it was all wadded up
ooo hermit money
buddy sees bushs signs
there it is
they stop at bushs sign no damn trespassing
frank squints up at the old shack and doesnt like what he sees at all
buddy opens his door but frank doesnt
what are you doing
youve been wanting a shot at sales
as of right now youre on commission
off buddys look remember foot in the door establish trust and drop the hammer
buddy hesitates crawls out and eyes the shack
id feel better if youd go too
no doubt but if you dont do this by yourself you wont know if youre any good
and youll never be any good if you dont know you are
go get him
as buddy uneasily approaches the shack he feels the beautiful stillness and mystery of the place
he knocks timidly on the door pressing an ear to listen
he shoots a look back to the hearse miles away and knocks a little louder
he inches to the window and peeks in one of the remaining glass panes then starts to slide away
buddy spins and discovers bush standing on the ground behind him his shotgun barrel pointed between buddys eyes
want to see in my house do you
bush blows away several windowpanes and re aims at buddys head
hows it look
buddy closes his eyes his last words are for his wife
it makes bush peek out from behind the barrel
you was at the church with your wife and baby
buddy opens his eyes and cant believe he is still alive
what the hell you doing here
i cant remember
they stand there while buddy thinks
oh yeah i heard
you wanted a funeral
i work at uh
i work at
tries to think of it quinn funeral home
i thought i could help you
bush glances at his blown out window damn
he lowers his gun walks up onto the porch
you like rabbit
bush goes inside
buddy looks desperately back at the hearse but cant see frank
he doesnt know whether to run for it or not
the shack is spare as a monks chamber but has wonderful hand made furniture in it
there is only chair at the table so buddy dumps the glass off a small stool under the window and sits down low
the wonder of not being dead makes him look at everything with new eyes
on a window sill he sees a beautiful little carved mule emerging from a block of wood
bush is at the stove tending to a iron skillet of rabbit pieces covered with bacon and white gravy
its how you put things together see
some things go some things never will
indians said that everything spoke to them
thats how they made medicine and knew what to eat
things talked to them clear as we talk
you believe that
i dont know sir
if you dont listen you wont hear nothing
bush puts the big skillet on the table and sits down
buddy is so low he can look under the table and sees how the table legs run right into the top without screws or nails
did you make this furniture sir
never seen any like it
cant even tell whats holding it up
buddy looks up
bush is dead serious
the word lingers
sir if you do want to plan for a funeral service which i hope will be a long long time away wed treat you with respect and offer a good
whatd everybody say about what happened in town
that crazy old son of a bitch tried to beat a man to death for no reason
buddy is caught off guard by bushs lucid candor and finds himself automatically responding differently to him
theres two sides to every story
as bush puts some rabbit on buddys old yellowed plate
people say that
but they dont mean it
they think what they think and they dont want to know anything else
yes sir but i think people are so scared of what they dont know that they make things up to feel better about it
like life after dying
i hope that parts true dont you
but i dont think we know the actual truth about much of anything
i know i dont
im just guessing most of the time
bush gives buddy a closer look and motions for him to try the rabbit
fearing the worst buddy bends into the steam takes a cautious bites and mutters with shocked surprise
lord thats good
you boys been coming out here to throw rocks through my window for years
yall know lots of stories about me
yes sir i guess but
id rather not
bush eases forward his eyes slit
the old bush is back
i rather you did
startled leans back well
when i was kid i heard you killed some men in a fist fight
is that all
bush leans back stone faced
in the silence buddy looks over again at the wondrous carving of the mule on the window sill at the big ears and long face that are being born from
the rough block
it makes him smile
but when he glances back bush is staring a hole through him
whats your name again
buddy robinson sir
well if i need you i know where you are
it sounds almost like a threat
it shorts buddy out
he stops eating and realizes that bush has taken another turn and that hes been dismissed
buddy heads to the hearse glancing back over his shoulder
as he recalls his encounter he stops looking back at the shack
the old legend has gotten deep under his skin
the morning sun breaks over the mountains
bush is on the porch straining boiled herbs grass and bark into a jar
there is something not right with him and he knows it
while the medicine cools he looks out across the mountain and draws a deep breath
a well crafted live in home doubling as a funeral parlor
a sign quinn funeral home hangs from the porch
oh yes maam i do respect your wishes but you see
frank is looking a little hung over
buddy walks in
frank points at the phone and rolls his blood shot eyes
state law requires
no maam we cant bury him under the house
there is a loud knock at the door
buddy goes to get it
buddy swings the door open
bush is standing there
buddy leans back unconsciously not knowing what to expect
well just for arguments sake maam how would we get the casket under the house
would you like to come in sir
bush stares suspiciously into the room then back at buddy
but you have to have a container of some kind maam for decency and uh sanitation
bush enters the funeral home
as buddy starts to close the door bush catches it
frank is still on the phone and pouring himself a drink from the flask into his coffee cup in the drawer
yes maam but theres lots of natural things that arent decent
listens eyes widen he did what
no maam i didnt know that about your husband
well yeah now i understand why you want him under the house but still
the phone goes dead
frank sighs as bush walks in
frank quinn mr
frank takes a quick swallow from his cup to fortify himself then jumps up smiling and goes to bush with his hand out
come in come in pleasure
as bush shakes franks hand he stares into him taking everything in his bloodshot eyes the wrinkled shirt beneath his suit his breath
frank feels downright naked
you from anywhere
a little bit of everywhere i guess
get him a chair buddy
buddy stands behind the waiting chair
bush scrapes up a different chair
frank goes behind the desk
buddy pulls up a chair
bush reaches into his coat and pulls out the wad of hermit money and lays it on the desk
frank does something phenomenal
he ignores the money
how can we help you sir
bush gives buddy a look then looks back at frank who steadfastly refuses to look at the ball of money
im after a funeral
boy are you in luck
frank and buddy stand with bush in a room dedicated to sales
three caskets are lined up for display
bush steps up to a cheap cloth covered box bangs it with his knuckles and scowls
frank points to a wooden casket
solid pecan steel handles
bush eyes it repulsed
bush is an amazing carpenter
forget the box
whatever you want flowers
what kind of party
stumped for once in his life frank looks at buddy
then years of honed instincts surge back to life
we can do that
as they come back into the office
and i want to be there
frank goes behind his desk
buddy and bush start to sit
you will be i guarantee it
i want to be there now
you want to be at your funeral
off bushs nod but
its not a funeral if youre not you know deceased
hold on now its a detail we can look at it
pretty big detail
frank cuts buddy a look then smiles at bush
so youd like to have a funeral party while youre alive so you can go
yes or no
buddy is lost
buddy get some paper
we need to make of list of who mr
bush wants to invite
as buddy starts to get up
buddy sits right down
i want everybody to come whos got a story to tell about me
that probably covers counties
bush shoots him a look
frank shoots him a look
buddy thinks about how great an outdoor life would be
then i want counties worth of people at the party
well sir the thing is how would you get people to come and tell stories about you that im guessing might get them you know
bush scoops up the ball of money and heads out
now all frank can see is the money leaving
you know what you go ahead dont worry about it well think of something
a couple of ideas just came to me
as bush starts out the open door he nearly bumps into buddys wife kathryn and mattie darrow
mattie is carrying kathryn and buddys baby boy
frank sees mattie and flicks his hair back nervously and quickly brushes his teeth with his finger as
bush gives mattie a glance and tries to be invisible
feigning deafness bush walks on
sensing something kathryn takes the baby so mattie can go after him
say hello to me
frank eyes wide with surprise mouths felix
bushs shoulder hunch then fall as he turns
he looks into her taking everything in
when he speaks his eyes and voice are soft
buddy comes out surprised to see mattie and bush together
frank walks up behind him and scowls
kathryn steers them back inside to give mattie privacy
heard you moved off
ive been back a while
how are you
you look like you always did
he abruptly rips himself away and is gone
buddy and frank are peeking out the window
they see mattie standing alone as bush walks away
how would she know him
its none of our business
we got to know
kathryn shakes her head and goes back outside
frank has another look at mattie then lets the curtain fall back
see the size of that thing
what do you mean what
goddamn ball of money
he wants a party with pink balloons on his ears were gonna give it to him
i sold of the ugliest cars ever made one december in chicago with wind blowing so hard up my ass i was farting snow flakes in july so dont tell
me we cant do this
thats the last but i want to hear out of you
youre a salesman now sell
looking out again she called him felix
kathryn rocks the baby in a carriage
mattie is beside her
a thousand years ago he was the most interesting man id ever met
get out of here
and i dont mean just the way he looked
i hope not
oh no listen he was beautiful
are you serious
most people are just laid out nice and simple you know
you always know what theyre thinking and where you are with them
but he was this
big old cave that went deeper and deeper
youd never get to the end of him
good lord you had a crush on him
all the girls did
i know hes something wild that crawls out of the hills once in a while and gets into trouble now but theres still nobody like him
bush comes out of the barn
frank and buddy are there
we have a plan
all we need is a little bit of your time
seeing it is better than hearing about it
bush looks at the hearse back at buddy and frank
how much is it gonna cost
did you say anything about money
touches his own chest i didnt say anything about money
if we cant get you what you want you dont owe us anything
frank buddy and bush ride in the front seat of the hearse
they are together but in very different worlds
they dont even look at each other when they talk
buddy is lost in serious thought
frank is preoccupied about the deal and driving too fast
bush is scrunched up to the door
he is going much faster than he is used to going
he kinda likes it and kinda doesnt
it moves dont it
this is nothing
fancy car for the dead
didnt buy it for them
out of nowhere we say that funerals are for the living but we forget what that means sometimes i guess
to bush but almost to i was thinking about your funeral party before i went to sleep last night and i think i understand it a little now
when i was a kid my folks where killed in a bad car wreck and the people at the funeral home
they did the impossible as far as i was concerned
i dont know what i wouldve done without them
and i remember wishing that my mother and daddy were there to see how beautiful they made everything
frank is hearing this for the first time and is shocked
bush glances softly at buddy then looks out the side window at the world rushing by too fast
all at once he gives in to it
the hearse pulls up on main street
frank buddy and bush get out and head toward feldmans clothing store
frank and buddy enter the store and find mr
feldman and a photographer setting up a large camera and backdrop
as they turn to show bush what is happening they see him go by the window outside
wheres he going
a barbers drape falls over bush who is seated in a chair
frank and buddy rush in
the barber an anxious mr
tollerude pumps bushs chair upward
i wish you wouldnt do that yet
bush gives him the hairy eyeball then speaks to mr
tollerude a clear threat
dont leave me naked
bush you can get all the hairs cut you want after we take your picture ill pay for it
tollerude doesnt know whether to cut or not
why you want my picture made
thats what were trying to tell you
were gonna run an ad in some papers about your party and put up posters of you
and you want me to look like this
its how people recognize you sir
and you want as many people to come as possible so
so a crazy old nutter draws more
dont you think
do you ever say what you mean
bush rips the bib off as tollerude whooshes him to the floor
bush is seated in front of a backdrop painted with a bridge a swan and a pond
the photographer is trying to tidy up bush without offending him
as he walks back to camera bush roughs himself up and looks truly wild
when the photographer gets back to the camera he cocks his head what
leans in to buddy id go see that
tollerude nervous as hell brings bush up from his reclining position and turns the chair to the mirror
bush studies his well trimmed hair and beard for a moment
its impossible to tell what his thoughts are as he looks into his own eyes
buddy and frank are in the mirror too staring at him
you look pretty good
bush suddenly gets up and nods at frank
as bush blows out the door mr
tollerude leans against the chair with relief
bush stands in front of a full length mirror
he has on a decent black suit pinned to be hemmed and a plain white shirt open at the collar
it is a startling change
but we still cant tell what he is thinking
buddy is staring at him with honest disbelief
frank is quietly trying to get mr
feldman to lower the price for the suit
he looks over and double takes bush
son of a bitch its almost worth it
what do you think
i wouldnt know you sir
maybe the devil wont either
might work out
wheres the shoes
well normally people dont wear shoes in a casket so
off bushs scowl what are you about a d
buddy stands beside frank who is still trying to get a deal on the clothes
bush walks up with two pairs of pants and two new shirts puts them on the counter gives frank a hard look and walks away
frank looks down at the clothes over at buddy
pretty optimistic taking a change of clothes to the grave
calls over his shoulder how you set for underwear
dont wear none
one question too many
everyone is back in the hearse
something is eating at frank
i dont mean to be nosey but uh
how do you know mattie
shes a peach
frank and buddy cut bush a look
he looks ahead
we had a go
frank nearly drives off the road
late night poker
cigarette smoke drifts into the air
frank carl rev
horton mattie and ray a banker are at the table
ray has the untouchable presence of someone privileged which appears to be driving frank up a tree tonight
horton gathers up his winnings
the lord loves a cheerful giver
you think the lords taking sides in a poker game in a funeral home
horton shrugs and points to the divine evidence
if he is the divines cheating
dont agree with me ray it makes me doubt myself
ray sighs and studies his perfectly cut nails
i would have turned down your loan if you were my own dear mother frank
you made my point and dont even know it
jesus would you two stop it
youre worse than two old women
ray shrugs sweetly blase
frank tries to rein in his temper for her
the loss of the hand is especially hard on carl who has only a couple of dollars left
what were you doing with that old bastard in town today anyway
buying him clothes getting him a haircut
frank shoots him a look
took out ads in a bunch of papers too something about a party
god i love small towns
who are you talking about
that hermit whats his name
a knowing look at mattie felix bush
youre giving him a party
a funeral party
whatever youre drinking is not being good to you at all
what the hell is a funeral party
hey the man wants to be at his own funeral
what can i say
id like to be at my funeral so i could tell my ex wife to kiss my
what makes you think shed show up for you
because dear vultures are constitutionally unable to ignore the dead
mattie grins which delights frank no end
horton stops counting his money and stares at frank
its that big wad of money of his youre after
there is a crack in rays disinterest that he tries to hide
what money is that
felix has money
everyone is looking at frank but he shuffles the cards
he came to see me wanting a funeral had a big old greasy ball of money
talked like he thought he could buy his way to heaven with it
how much has he got
maybe he can
hearing that bush wants or needs a real funeral mattie is suddenly truly concerned
is he sick gus
frank notes the concern and doesnt like it
carl coughs and his ribs make him break out into a sweat
ill tell you one damn thing aint nobody gonna go to a funeral for that son of a bitch
mattie gives carl a look language
hes inviting everyone who has a story about him to come
you could tell about him kicking your ass carl
carl looks at frank as if he wants to cold cock him
old man is going to ride the weird train right into the ground isnt he
wouldnt you like to know what everybody says about you behind your back ray
off his look yeah probably not
i already know way more about people than i need to
or want to
lets play some cards
oh for gods sake face it frank youre broke
this is not about cards
its a declaration meant to embarrass frank in front of everyone
frank feels their eyes on him as he starts to pull off his watch
ray waves it off
ive won that times already
its who has it last that counts
say what you want but if there hadnt been anybody there the other day he wouldve killed me
and i guarantee you it wouldnt have been his first time
it sounds true and everyone is quiet except mattie
everybody knows you started it
off his glare dont look at me like that
i remember when you were born
you were the sweetest little boy
what is wrong with you
momentarily shamed carls face softens and we can see a better man there
he struggles to hold on to it but
i made a mistake
but theres a line
and he crossed it
and everybody knows that too
yall go on and have a party with the devil for his money but ill dance on his grave someday
carl snatches his few dollars up and heads out
you kind of hate to admit it when it comes to carl but hes got a point
you dont know what bush is doing
what if he just wants to get everybody in one place so he can turn his shotgun on them
i looked in his eyes
the truth is nobody knows what hes capable of
maybe even he doesnt know
she looks into him
frank starts to deal the cards
go ahead and lay your watch down frank
but i am going to keep it this time alright on principle
i got an idea
lets try something different
the cards in your sock
ray shakes his head
what are you trying to pull now
you really think youre that good that nobody sees
you cheat at everything you do
even at the bank you loan people just enough to getem deeper in so you can foreclose on them
you are a pathetic man
and a goddamn
then stand up and roll down your socks
a deep dark look stand up or ill stand you up
ray looks around the table and suddenly realizes that he is irreversibly exposed and alone
the sound of franks chair scraping the floor makes him jerk up
he walks out trying to find his old confident rhythm and failing
everyone sits in uneasy silence
horton waves and walks out leaving the door open
frank walks mattie to the door helping with her coat trying to work up his nerve to say
ill walk you home
off her firm nod youre not going to play anymore are you
oh i dont know
thank you for inviting me though
im sorry about the
we dont always fight okay we do but hes had that coming for
its not that
trails off you came because you dont know what to do with yourself
off her look i slept on the same side of the bed my whole life right
but after my wife left me i switched sides just like that and never been able to go back
when someone you love is gone you can pour everything even a lifetime of things into the place where they were but its still always empty
he sees that her thoughts are not with him at all but a million miles away
she hardly glances up when she says
he stares after her wishing that she could see him the way he sees her
dim lamp light glows
we see bush sitting on the edge of the bed wiping the sweat from his face with a sheet
he looks up at the picture of the beautiful woman
buddy sits in the dark rocking his son who is asleep
a small lamp casts a shadow across them
kathryn comes in
i didnt hear him wake up
everythings all right hon
im glad you dont know how quick it can change
she gently kisses his arm and the babys head
buddy looks at her haunted by the very possibility of their absence
mattie is standing on the sidewalk at feldmans store with her coat collar pulled up against the cold giving someone we cant see a bemused affectionate scolding
have you completely lost your mind
mattie cont d straighten up for heavens sake before somebody throws a net over you
but she smiles in spite of herself glances around to see if anyone was watching and moves discretely on
as she does we see that she was talking to a striking wanted poster of a wild man sitting in front of a pond a swan and a bridge
the text reads
a tiny place cramped with radio gear
buddy and frank peer through a glass window into a small control booth
we will cut back and forth between the glass buddy is having misgivings about being here
but frank gives the thumbs up to the young wcgm announcer in the booth a hopeful kid with a smooth voice and dreams of the big time
the announcer hands bush a set of headphones
bush is wearing his new clothes and truly looks like a different man
bush is puzzled by the headset
the kid takes it and clamps it onto bushs head
he starts to yank them off then hears a song playing inside his head and loves it
but now the announcer cuts the record off and bush scowls
friends we have a treat for you today on wcgm
our special guest is going to tell us about an event that everyone is talking about
and here he is mr
felix bush the mysterious hermit of caleb county
how are you today sir
bush is surprised by the sound of his own voice
so tell us sir exactly how did you come up with the idea of having a funeral party before you die
i dreamed it
why would i make that up
two seconds of dead air as the announcer finds his feet
now i have to say that you dont look quite like you do on the posters
i got pruned
well youre a bit of a local legend sir
i was a little nervous about our interview
ive heard some pretty wild stories
well uh just
from what i understand you want everyone who has a story about you to come and tell it
is that right
you come and tell yours
now how long have you been living out there by yourself
mattie is cutting the stems of some lovely yellow flowers and arranging them in a vase
years with nobody to talk to
first are the hardest
but why would you do that mr
bush shut yourself off like that
frank isnt happy with this but buddy wants to hear
come to the funeral and maybe youll find out
you heard it here on wcgm folks find out the answer to the mystery february
one more thing boy
frank and buddy tense
mattie tenses at the sound in bushs voice
gonna be a drawing
what kind of drawing sir
you buy a ticket for
the day of the funeral we draw names
then when i die the winner gets my place acres of timber that hasnt been touched in years
mattie accidentally cuts a bloom off of a flower
the kid frank and buddy are all staring at bush
send it to the quinn funeral home
franks eyes light up like fiery pinwheels and he almost yelps
buddy looks oddly perplexed and sad
you heard him
if you want a chance to win acres of virgin timber worth thousands and thousands of dollars send dollars along with your name and address to
off frank waving and pointing to himself frank quinn at quinn funeral home
as the announcer begins a song bush moves his head in time with the music
frank and buddy rush into the control booth
i could almost kiss you on the mouth
ill take a ticket
youre betting on a man dying
i didnt mean it like
hey its his idea
they look at bush who has taken off the headset and looking at it like he wants to take it home
its what you want right
buy a ticket son
mattie puts the vase of flowers on table with a group of family photographs
the picture beside the vase is the same photograph of the beautiful woman that bush has
is it mattie
it looks a little like her
insert photo the beautiful young woman stares at us as we pull back to reveal that we are now looking at the identical photo tacked to bushs wall
bush starts out of the barn draws back and peeks through the wall boards a figure approaches
reveal mattie walking mattie
mattie enters straining to see into the barn
her eyes adjust to find him standing near mule
she is startled and pleased by his new do
look at you
i wondered if you were still under that beard
wasnt nowhere else to go
i heard you on the radio
youve gotten downright chatty
i reckon so
this is nice
i drove by a few times after i got back but
you want to see it
do you want me to
the first stop on the tour is a small fenced grave site near the shack
three grave markers with names carved into them bush is squatting down staring at the markers
mattie stands close beside him
since his attention is elsewhere she looks at him in an unguarded way
her mind is full of questions old and new
you always know where you stand with a dog
want to lay here with them someday if theyll have me
mattie and bush walks side by side through the last of the glimmering light and shadows beneath the trees
it is a chilly and matties cheeks are flushed
she is enchanted by the place
bush tries to hide how winded he is
it really is beautiful
probably looked like this everywhere a hundred years ago
you leave things alone they know what to do
i dont know what to do about anything much
youve been alone a long time
some people are more suited to it than others i reckon
thats funny cause i never thought that itd suit you
i knew you wouldnt be like anybody else but
no one to talk to no one to
he looks into her then looks away at something
how you sleeping these days girl
how am i what
you sleep good
no not lately
howd you know
he veers off the path and pulls up a plant and brings it back to her
chamomile its good when the nights get long
helps you nod off
she takes it and smiles up at him
want to go on a ways
would you stay for supper
i dont want to be any trouble
a supper guest every years is not much trouble girl
he holds out his arm
better stay close some big old wild cats been eating my chickens
she looks around and takes his arm
or maybe it was me
she snorts and slaps his arm but doesnt let go
they enter the dark room together
bush lights a lantern gets a chair from a corner and holds it out for her
she sits and watches him check a cast iron pot on the warm stove and put a log on the fire
she notices the beautiful table
you always were good with your hands
he puts a glass of tea in front of her and sits down
you still play the piano
i teach a few girls
i got a good feeling when you played
remember that time you was playing and the lamp burned out
and you went right on in the dark
i hear that song sometimes at night
she shrugs shyly and sips the tea
seconds tick by
sure is quiet out here
cocks his head what
i said its
stops gets the joke i tried to write you at times but i didnt know what to say
i heard you married
he was a doctor a real good man
we lived in st
louis for awhile
he died unexpectedly about a year ago
i came back here because
i have no idea why
sips tea thinks the list of people who are gone is getting longer and longer and sometimes i feel like all im doing is waiting for my name to come
you have a tender heart always did
she gives him a curious look
you cant wait for anything mattie
close your eyes hold your breath
stay in one spot your whole life but youre still moving like the worlds moving under you
theres no waiting
and theres no getting over some things either is there
reckon not little bit
oh my god nobodys called me that in
but suddenly she is lifted from the chair as if by strong ropes
she stares at the wall as she walks toward bushs bed
bush is stricken and white
he would stop her if he could but it is too late
she walks right up to the picture at the edge of the lamp light and stares into it as if it is a mirage that will disappear if she blinks
finally she whirls and looks at him her face a tortured mask
a strangled sob escapes her
he gets up and stands there staring at the floor
suddenly she is moving toward him and then past him and out the door
her shadow merges with the darkness
bush stands with his head down staring into oblivion
buddy comes in frowning and lugging a heavy mail sack
what the hell
he looks up and sees more sacks dumped on the desk
frank is grinning and ripping open envelopes from the sacks and each one has dollars in it
buddy looks down and sees even more mail sacks on the floor
but but its not our money
well yeah no but some of its gonna be
were putting this thing on
frank rips open two more envelopes and dollar bills rain down to the floor
hes beside himself
buddy eyes him warily
he should be here
im gonna go get him
they lock eyes
frank finally tosses him the hearse keys
buddy frank and bush are staring reverently at the money stacked across the desk and the full paper sacks all around the desk
bush eyes buddy who is still quiet
i dont know exactly how much your lands worth but looks to me like you could get maybe times that or more
i dont know what to do with it
i mean its yours to do with what you want but im getting a little nervous about it
never thought id see enough money to make me nervous
we should probably talk about the price for everything the clothes the ads the food and drink for the party the music
our fee for everything well be fair about that im not worried about it
bush is looking at buddy who is looking across the room
what do you think boy
buddy jerks looks at frank at bush
money makes people do funny things
i think you should probably put it in the bank sir
ray is not
off bushs look i mean if it was my money id put it in a bank out of town so everyone didnt know my business
this bank here you cant trust thats all im saying
can i trust you
every name every dollar is right there
not what i asked
ive done a hell of a job for you
i dont see why
bush i didnt mean to imply
ive sold horses cars houses hell pocket watches pinned to the inside of my coat
im not ashamed of it
i dont rob banks dont cheat at cards and i sleep all right the nights i sleep
what was the question
he nods at the money and suddenly becomes the other bush
take out for the expenses youve already had and give me the receipts
as the bills come in for things give them to me and ill pay them
put this money in a box and the boy and ill take it someplace in the morning
whatever new comes in keep it in the bottom of one of them ugly caskets in there till i come get it
after the party name a fair price for what youve done and well settle up
ill be at the car
after hes gone frank and buddy stare at each other
is it just me or is he extremely fucking articulate when he wants to be
i dont know whos selling who what anymore
its not clear is it
not only that but something feels really wrong
i told you that you were working on commission
so whatever our end of this is you get a piece
it could help set you up buddy
so whatever feels wrong is gonna feel right pretty damn quick okay
we just have to close it out
from here on watch me do what i do and well be fine
he wants you to go with him to take this money somewhere which means that its you he trusts
and thats fine because i trust you too
just dont trust him okay
im lost again
look that funny feeling you have
i have it too
and its not funny
so go along be friendly but thats it
theres a euphoria that comes with closing a deal buddy and the bigger the deal the higher you get
its better than anything
but the critical time is just before it closes
its like a witching hour and everything tries to come apart
were not going to let that happen
as buddy starts out you know
i always wondered why you wanted to work here
i thought you could do a lot better
off buddys look back i didnt know about your folks im really sorry
he goes on
frank turns and flips through a large stack of bills hungrily entranced
buddys son is crying his heart out
kathryn comes in unbuttoning her blouse picks him up sits down slips her blouse off her shoulder brings the boy to her breast and voila his sorrow miraculously vanishes
buddy appears in the doorway his eyes soft with love
i might have a crying fit coming on too
is that right
feeling a little weepy
leans against door frame i can maybe do something really good for us katy
you already have
i mean money wise
im getting half of whatever we make off of him
so why arent you happy about it
didnt know i wasnt
off her look i was happy for a minute
and then the whole thing of making a carnival out of a persons death i dont know if its right
is it what he wants
he says it is
you are not responsible for what other people do buddy just you
youre always right
at least i am when im half naked
a very determined little girl is working her way through a song on the piano that is unrecognizable in this form even to her
mattie sits just behind the girl with tears in her eyes not really listening
on the table beside the piano is a stack of picture albums and old yellowed newspaper articles
sitting in the hearse outside of bushs shack buddy watches bush get in the car with his shotgun
there is a big wooden box of money on the seat between them
bush props his shotgun against it
where to sir
starting the hearse how far
till i say son
buddy gives him an uneasy look and pulls off down the tree lined path
the hearse slips around the narrow road that cuts through miles of farm land lying fallow in the winter
buddy looks out at the highway
he is driving slow
bush is leaning against the money thinking
how much further now
bush waves him on
buddy scowls then decides to get serious about this
he presses on the accelerator and the hearse takes off down the highway
frank is hopelessly lost in a sea of envelopes
the phone is ringing off the hook there are full sacks around him and some reporter is trying to take a picture through the front window
frank scowls and lowers the blinds
frank is at matties door entranced by the troubled but beautiful piano music coming from inside
it stops abruptly when he knocks
in seconds mattie appears
he looks almost boyish and bashful as he drinks her in
was that you
it was really
this is a surprise
he stands loving the view forgetting why he is here
she waits it out as long as she can not sure how she feels about this adoring look
was there something you
im up to my ears with this funeral and i thought you know we havent had time to talk much lately so maybe youd like to come over and rip
open envelopes with me and im sorry i have lessons all afternoon
i have to get back in
oh okay i just
she slips back inside
frank stares at the door
mattie leans against the door with her eyes closed
there is no student at the piano
the hearse is parked in front of a beautiful white board church
close on bush and buddy
dont say nothing
you can say hi
bush gets out
buddy sighs mimes hi and gets out
buddy quietly creeps in through the front door looks back over his shoulder scowls and enters the church
he stops and looks around awed by the beautifully serene sanctuary
now he sees a tall black man come out of an office door behind the pulpit walk up the aisle glancing out the window at the driveway and then at
buddy is out of words that he is allowed to say
he glances at the door but bush is not coming in
charlie holds out his hand buddy shakes it
are you sure youre in the right place
not expecting a funeral
suddenly bush steps into the church
charlie squints over then stares at bush with utter disbelief
they shake hands then hug
buddy is blown away that bush would hug anyone
bush looks up at the church rafters
charlie give bush a look then holds out his hand to buddy again
reverend charlie jackson
thats buddy robinson he dont talk much
someone better talk
a ghost pulls up in the driveway in a hearse you expect a little bit of a story
bush buddy and charlie sit in pews near a lovely altar
my hearing is not what it was
it sounded like you said you want me to preach at your funeral party with you sitting there
shaking his head you know ive talked to god a lot about you over the years and he said he broke the mould when he made you
said you were sure entertaining to watch but way too much trouble
what would you want me to say at this funeral
whatever you want to charlie
could you give us a minute
buddy starts to get up
buddy plops back down
whats the matter
you scared to be alone with me
he can hear whats said
buddy is surprised again
so is charlie
after you left here
did you do the right thing
felix looks up at the beautifully crafted pulpit
what i thought was right
bush looks off and the muscles jump in his jaw
did you tell her felix
charlie sighs leans on his knees and drops his head
you came a long way for nothing then
bushs eyes jerk back to charlie and they are hot
you self righteous
dont you dare
i built my own jail and put myself in it
and i stayed in it for goddamn years
no wife no kids no friends
thats not enough
you know it isnt
tears welling up well
why dont you come and say that then charlie
hell say it all
i dont care
not on your life
the air is so heavy you cant breathe it
bush suddenly gets up and leaves
buddy starts to follow
charlie puts his hand on him to stay
they sit in silence a moment
how much do you know about him
almost nothing sir
i just work at the funeral home
do you know he built this church
hows a man like him make something like this
i mean i know hes a good carpenter but this is
off buddys look maybe its the best of him maybe he put his soul into it i dont know
what yall were talking about
what did he do
who was he supposed to tell
for him and god to know i guess
i wish id never been put between them thats for sure
i will tell you that he showed up here half dead
i had just started preaching
over the next years we built this
are you coming to the funeral
charlie sighs and looks around
a omitted a buddy and bush are both lost in thought
can i ask you something
do you have to
what are we doing
since the day you came into the funeral home i dont think anything has happened that you didnt want to happen
i just dont know where its going
theres a whole lot of things that you dont know
like what a dog dreams
you can make up a story about him chasing rabbits but you dont know if theres rabbits in there or not
and he cant tell you can he
not unless hes a very special dog
they snort together
people dont say what they mean either so you dont really know any more about them then you do about that dogs dream
that time you left my house i saw you stop and look back
you wanted to know what could make somebody like me
off buddys uneasy look well here you are son here you are
frank is putting money into a casket
he checks his watch
where are you
lighting flashes and the lights suddenly go out
the hearse creeps down the road buddy looks tired
bush is sitting up ramrod straight thinking hard about something
i better stop and tell frank were back
hes probably had or hissy fits by now
looks out at the rain why dont you stay the night at the house and ill take you home in the morning
the simple kindness seems to short bush out
buddy doesnt notice hes still looking ahead
i aint stayed with nobody in a
in a long while
its fine if you want to
bush looks as if he might say yes but he notices where the car is passing through and
let me out
stop the car
bush starts to open the door
buddy stops abruptly
you cant walk
its too far
bush climbs out with his shotgun
put the money in a casket
you might as well get back in ill follow you all the way
snaps the gun closed get the hell out of here boy
buddys eyes are defiant
bush slams the door and walks away crossing over a fence and out into a dark field
he slams the steering wheel
buddy is putting the money into the foot of a casket
a lit candelabra sits nearby
there is noise like the muted sound of something breaking
buddy jerks and listens
he stuffs the money into the casket grabs the candelabra comes back seals the lid and starts into the office
under the trees crooked rows of cold ghostly headstones glisten in the darkness
an old pocket lighter flares to reveal bush staring at a pot of yellow flowers
he holds the lighter to a tombstone and brushes away the debris
it reads mary lee stroup b
close on bushs face as rain begins to fall
they keep talking about forgiveness
ask jesus for forgiveness
i never did nothing to him
frank enters with a flashlight
he sees that his desk and files have been ransacked
he rushes into the casket room
several caskets have been thrown to the floor
he goes to the one where the money is finds that it is sealed tight and sighs with relief
hearing something he whips the light around and sees buddy on the floor
frank examines a cut and bump on top of buddys head by flashlight and dabs it gently with a cloth
the cuts not bad but hows the head
he moves his finger across buddys eyes
he looks him over carefully
hes had experience
off buddys no youll be okay
did you see who it was
i was putting the money in
heard glass breaking
locked up the casket quick and
you did good
doesnt feel good
mattie sits beside a fire knitting a baby blanket by an oil lamp
all at once the lights sputter on the radio lights up warms and begins to play as a knock at the door
mattie pulls the door open
bush is standing there soaking wet breathing hard holding his shotgun
she draws back reflexively
he looks into her
bush stands with a towel around him shivering
mattie opens a dresser drawer
inside the drawer is the carefully arranged tableau of a watch a ring a stethoscope and some clothes
she hates to disturb the drawer but pulls out a pair of black pants and a white shirt lays them on the bed and walks out
mattie steps from the kitchen with a steaming mug as bush comes down the stairs in clothes that are too loose
still shivering bush steps uneasily in front of the fire
mattie hands him the hot mug
he looks uneasily at the yellow flowers on the table nearby
what are you doing here
burned through a log falls in the fire
bush jerks oddly and moves away
can i sit a minute
she stares at him then nods at a chair
she keeps standing behind the other chair
he bends over the mug and seems to lock up inside
you want to know why i have your sisters picture on my wall
im not stupid felix
no i take that back
how long was it going on
she was already married when i met you
were you just making up to me to get to her
bush is so still he looks like a gargoyle
if youre not going to talk leave
can you help who you love
matties face tells us that she has asked herself that question many times
ive had years to think about it and i still dont know
i dont know either so
slowly the gargoyle unfolds
his eyes drill into her
i want to tell you how it was
if you dont want me to ill go
mattie sighs from down deep in her shoes then comes around and sits down
dont lie to me
when did you take up with her
i came to see you and she was there hanging clothes on the line with your mama
bush stares out the window so hard mattie turns to see what he is looking at
she turned around
as mattie turns back and
i promise you that i did not know that i had a heart till right then
tears well up in matties eyes
you were a fine fine girl
i didnt know why you wanted anything to do with me but i was gonna keep coming to see you till my luck ran out
and then i saw her
she was married
and she wasnt just my sister she was my best friend
we told each other everything
how long did it go on
bushs face is so white it looks like a death mask
its still going on little bit
mattie tries to absorb that
the truth and tragedy of it touches her in way that she is not prepared for
they sit there in silence
she suddenly wipes her face and scowls
did you have anything to do with her death
the mug trembles
she sees it
like a fish jerked from the water he mouth opens and closes but nothing comes out
off his haunted silence get out of my house
bush stands up quickly and starts for the door
and go to hell
he staggers tries to catch himself but slides down against the wall
despite her anger mattie starts toward him
bush sits on the floor pale as moonlight
mattie is beside him with a stethoscope in her lap
you need to see a doctor
he raises his eyes to her but says nothing
they look into each other for a long moment
just tell me felix
did you hurt mary or not
bush stares into her then suddenly gets up picks up his shotgun and goes out the door without a word
frank is putting the files back in the drawers when he hears a noise
he reaches into the drawer and turns with a pistol in his hand
bush is standing in the doorway with his shotgun
what the hell
bush glances at the pistol at the open drawers of the cabinet and desk
they get it
buddy sealed it up in a casket
took a crack on the head but
cold dark look is he all right
i was an army medic
hell be fine
but bush is still dark
but you ought to take those clothes back and get something in your size
they get the whiskey
frank sits with his feet on the desk
bush sits across from him
they each have a cup of whiskey
brought the money back huh
off bushs absent nod listen ive been thinking
what if we had the party at your place
people are going to want to see the land theyre getting so
well think about it we could
dont know that im doing it
thinking to call it off
damn well can if i want to
no no no its in motion
if i say no its no
send the money back
youre killing me
i bought things hired people
promised money everybody in town is hoping to
i care about this town as much as they care about me
its what you said you wanted and ive busted my ass for you
so why dont you want it anymore
you owe me that
it was the end of the line tell it all get out of jail party
but i guess i aint got the goddamn guts to open my own mouth and i cant get nobody to talk for me so the hell with it
and to hell with me
bush grabs his shotgun and goes
frank sits stunned
buddy sits at the breakfast table holding his son
he opens and closes his eyes checking out his vision
kathryn at the stove sees him out of the corner of her eye
are you having trouble seeing
i see youre mad
im not mad
im concerned she shoves the skillet off the burner and comes to him
no youre mad
she tenderly touches his head
if i could get my hands on whoever did this youd see mad
frank rushes in lifts a phantom hat to kathryn scrapes up a chair pulls on the babys toe and looks at buddy
whats the matter
bush is pulling out
what happened yesterday
i told you we went up to illinois and met a preacher
but what happened
he asked the preacher to come to the funeral
he said no
son of a bitch thats got to be
to the baby sorry
wheres the preacher
it wont do you any good
he knows something about bush something bad i think
what is it
wouldnt say but
well if bush wants him by god bush is gonna get him
slams the skillet down you want eggs frank or will the skillet do
my husband has his head bashed in and all you care about is this party
its not like that katie this is for all of us
family to me
this is not how family acts
well im sorry
ive never had any practice
gets up to buddy you okay
buddy mutters to the baby
stay out of her way today partner
mattie is on her knees trying to plant bulbs in the hard cold ground
her trowel barely gouges the earth
she stabs it again and again into the ground
fool its too late for bulbs
suddenly she hurls the trowel as far as she can then a handful of bulbs
then her hat
too goddamn late
buddy is surrounded by bags
he is copying down names onto raffle tickets and putting them in bin for the drawing
there is a man standing guard by the front door with a rifle
mule stands with his ears back upset
bush back in his old clothes is angrily planing a board
the box of his casket minus the lid is on sawhorses behind him
a blurred image becomes clear as a magnifying glass lowers to a page of a stamp collection book
fingers fill an empty space with a prized addition
a loud knocking startles him and the stamp is placed slightly crooked
reveal charlie jackson scowling at the crooked stamp
he gets up does a double take out the window
more loud knocking
charlie opens the door sees frank standing there
the hearse is parked outside
charlie looks at hearse frank quinn quinn funeral home
howd you find me
frank just smiles takes off his hat and offers his hand
charlie gives him a long look and reluctantly motions him in
frank enters noting the clean simple home of man with an orderly mind
charlie motions for frank to sit down
i was going to play some dominos this afternoon
but something told me to stay home
i should have played dominos
is he out there
did you check the back
frank snorts liking charlie immediately
you told bush that you wouldnt come to the funeral
if he got that why are you here
to help you rethink it
i dont need any help
have you rethought it
off charlies look so there is a need
first off bush doesnt know im here
i wouldnt be so sure about that
off franks look hes got a way of making people do what he wants them to
frank squirms knows it true
is he really a hermit
frank whistles and takes bushs poster out of his coat
charlie jerks at the picture of the wild man
he came to see me after hed been here wants to call the party off
i dont care
said hed meant it to be a
end of the line tell it all get out of jail funeral but that he didnt have the guts to open his mouth and he couldnt get anybody to talk
you know anything about that part
off charlies sigh at first he said he wanted everybody to come who had a story about him
but he didnt want to hear their bullshit stories did he
pardon my language
he wants to tell one doesnt he
whatever he did its been locked up in him for years and he cant get it out
off charlies look i think he told you
you may be the only person he told
and now he wants you to tell it for him
because he wont
at least he wants the truth to come out give him that
ill think about it
is there a boarding house around here
i said id think
yeah but if youre not coming im not going back
i made promises i cant keep to people i care about
this falls apart they wont blame bush
bank will take my business
if im gonna have to start over again might as well be from here
charlie scowls at him
using a tool buddy unseals the casket to put the new money in it and discovers that the rest of the money is gone
he cant believe it
he yanks back the casket bed lining
bush is sanding the beautiful lid of his casket
it is leaning against the wall and sawdust is drifting down all over him
he suddenly stops rubs the wood tenderly muscles up the heavy top to put it on the box and staggers back
its not the weight something is wrong
sweat pops out on his forehead
he forces himself to the casket and drops the top down hard staggers back against the loft ladder slides down to the ground and stares at the casket
is this it
the hearse sits on the side of the road
road signs give the mileage to different destinations
frank is lying in the back of the hearse his head propped up on an old suitcase
he sips from his flask and stares out the window thinking
bush is still on the ground propped against the ladder
his eyes are closed and the fading light steals across his face that is as still as it can be
the sawdust makes him look almost wooden
a shadow crosses then comes closer
buddy is sure he is dead but bushs eyes open
what are you doing sir
getting a suntan
bush starts to get up then falls back against the ladder
are you stuck
you have no goddamn idea how right you are son
buddy moves to help him up but bush waves him off
ill sit here a minute
bush looks at the butterfly bandage on buddys head
were a pair aint we
are you sick
just going through the motions
what does that mean
theres alive and theres dead
and theres a worst place in between them that i hope you never know nothing about
do you know who hurt you
it doesnt matter
frank went somewhere and the raffle money is gone
you figure he took off with it
i dont know
i dont want to think that
but the moneys not here and i dont know where it is
he said hed call and he never did
buddy glances into the shadows and sees the casket looming on the sawhorses
he stares at it
what do you want to do
buddy looks back at bush
realizing just then i want to make this funeral for you if you want it
a long look hell
do it if you can
i guess for everyone like me theres one like you son
i about forgot that
buddy holds out his hand to help bush up but bush forces himself up on his own and walks out
charlie sits at his desk staring blankly at his crooked stamp
suddenly fate in the form of frank quinn looms at the window
charlie knows he is there but he wont look at him
buddy kathryn and the baby are sleeping soundly
there is a scratching noise
buddy sits up grabs a baseball bat and falls back asleep
the scratching starts again
he opens his eyes surprised to see the bat in his hand
he hears the scratching
he looks around sees something at the window
he slides to the floor crawls on his knees and looks out
frank is standing there scratching on the screen
behind him is charlie looking very unhappy about standing in the near dark in a small southern town scratching on a screen
buddy realizes what he is seeing and starts to smile
frank buddy and charlie are on the porch watching the world come to life
charlie looks as if he is hoping for some kind of sign from above
im glad you decided to come sir
free will is not all that its cracked up to be
did you take the money out of the casket
why didnt you tell me
where is it
in the hearse under the floorboards
charlie remembers that frank said he wasnt coming back and gives him a look
buddy is giving frank the same look
nobody steals a hearse
now all we got to do is take the reverend here to bush and
i forgot to tell you mr
bush already said he would do it
youre shittin me
charlie gets up and starts walking away
where can i catch a train
you cant leave you just got here
watch and learn
wheres the station
a tractor pulling a trailer with a big old honking generator on it a truck loaded with equipment and workers for the big event rumbles down a dirt road
the quinn funeral home hearse completes the unlikely parade
bush dressed in his new suit shirt and shoes is a striking figure
the old hermit is gone
he looks into the mirror
horton hold the car door open for kathryn who is holding the baby and looking back puzzled at matties house
finally she sighs and gets into the car
mattie stands staring out the window
she is not going
at the top of a wide clearing a truck with a circus ad on the door is being set up to become a stage
the tractor and truck pull into the clearing and drive to the circus truck
the hearse pulls in and parks
frank buddy and charlie climb out of the hearse look around and stand frozen
trucks and cars are parked everywhere around the big clearing
many people have been here all night with fires tents and lean tos
many more people are arriving now
expecting a crowd
frank and buddy give each other a look
we dont have a clue about whats going to happen here
the big old honking generator is unloaded
holes are dug
foot poles are slid from the truck and huge speaker horns are attached
speaker poles are pulled up and set into holes
frank directs a gang of kids who are selling raffle tickets making sure they know that he has his eyes on them
a band arrives on the back of pick up truck
the generator kicks on belching smoke everywhere
frank is yelling whoa whoa
disaster in the making
bush stands staring out the checkerboard window
he sees charlie approaching and opens the door for him
charlie climbs the steps appraises the shack and stares at bush
pretty nice jail
charlie enters and looks around the little room
why did you change your mind
charlie just looks at him the unspoken words louder than any reason he could give
how do you want to do this
he gets a haunted look that catches charlie off guard
im gonna try and tell it charlie i really am
but if i cant get it done would you do it
i want it said
charlie sighs from down in his shoes and starts for the door
tellem the box is in the barn
carls truck is half hidden off the road
carl gary and theman get out of the truck
carl tucks an old in the back of his pants
gary and theman grab three gas cans off the truck give one to carl and clamber down a deep gully and start up the other side
tom peeks out from behind the big garbage barrels
the generator is working
and standing on the flat bed truck which is now a stage an announcer introduces a hot blue grass group the crowd is huge now and listens as the group
kicks off a song
behind the stage frank is collecting money from the boys who are selling the raffle tickets making them turn their pockets inside out
the generator makes a strange noise frank eyeballs it and it labors on
buddy walks up nudges frank and nods out at the huge crowd
can you believe this
charlie walks up and says something that we cannot hear
pacing the cage bush peeks out the window
you asked for it you old ornery sonofabitch now what are you gonna do
frank buddy and charlie enter the barn and see mule hitched to the wagon
on the back of the wagon is a simple and rustically elegant casket with the initials fb carved into the center board
it sobers them all
carl gary and theman hide and watch frank buddy and charlie walk mule and the wagon away from the barn and down the road
carl eyes bushs shack and starts for it
hey hey where you going
he said the woods
and he takes off
the bluegrass fiddle player nods to the others to quickly end the song
now we see why
frank buddy and charlie have brought the wagon with the coffin into the field
everyone quiets remembering why they are here
they park the wagon behind the hearse
frank and charlie walk toward the stage
buddy peels away
frank calls after him to come with them to the stage but buddy waves them away
he wants no part of that
he sees kathryn and horton threading their way through the crowd and moves toward them instead
frank and charlie climb the makeshift stairs up to the stage
charlie sits down on a folding chair while frank goes to the big microphone and stares with satisfaction at the huge depression era woodstock crowd
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
im frank quinn of quinn funeral home
welcome to the live funeral party of mr
people dont know whether to clap or not
some do and the rest of them pick it up
buddy gets to kathryn and hugs her and the baby
she wouldnt come
ive done some things in my life but never this
bet you havent either bet no one has
winks back at charlie we try to make things predictable and safe but if we dont risk everything to get what we want we dont want it enough
frank finds buddy in the crowd
the person who made all of this happen for us doesnt like the spotlight but buddy robinson is the heart of quinn funeral home and im proud to know him
buddy is embarrassed and moved
kathryns eyes soften
carl is sloshing gasoline onto the back porch while gary and theman keep nervous watch at the farendof porch
suddenly carl feels a shotguns cold metal on his neck and the being ripped from his belt and thrown to the ground
carl drops his can
the other men drop their cans but gary starts to pull a pistol from his back pocket
go on ill paint the porch with his head
dont do it
gary drops the pistol
now pick up them cans and keep pouring
you heard me
the men cautiously pick up the cans
pour it on your head
all of it
the men look at each other
bush cocks the other barrel of his shotgun
pour it or die i dont care which
the men hoist the cans and start to pour the gasoline over them
burning and spitting they empty the cans
suddenly theman bolts moaning and running blind with gas in his eyes
i got two barrels anybody else wants to rabbit nows the time
i know many of you have heard stories about mr
but today ive been told that were going to hear another kind of story his
a murmuring moves in a wave across the crowd as they see
bush enters the field with his shotgun pointed at carl and garys backs
they are drenched with gas and it is burning them through their clothes
buddy kathryn and horton see bush
quinn and charlie follow the crowds eyes to bush
holy mother of
sheriff deputies beside the stage see bush
but everyone remains frozen not knowing what has happened or what to do now
is this the crazy bush of the legends
buddy starts toward bush
kathryn tries to stop him but he pulls free and walks slowly toward bush
a shot rings out
carl and gary hit the ground like dead men
the crowd hunkers and scatters
horton steps in front of kathryn and the baby
charlie rushes up beside frank at the microphone
carl rolls up and turns to bush and sees blood seeping out onto his shirt beneath his coat
bush whirls and sees
carls old still smoking
the gun is in toms small shaking hands
dont hurt him
its my fault
bush cracks his shotgun walks slowly to the boy gently takes the empties the shells and hands the gun back
a second chance is a precious thing son
dont waste it
the boy plops down overwhelmed
and suddenly everyone is in motion
the deputies run toward bush
frank and charlie rush from the stage
kathryn and horton are going
buddy arrives at bush first and sees the blood weeping onto his shirt
are you alright sir
without turning bush glances at the deputies
tried to burn me out
let the boy be he didnt mean nothing
as the deputies get a hold of carl and gary frank charlie kathryn and horton arrive
carl looks at horton with pleading eyes and nods to tom
help him gus please
horton goes to the trembling boy and picks him up
bush suddenly walks into the trees without looking back
the announcer hangs up the phone on the wall rushes to the turntable and lifts the tone arm from the record that is playing
folks ive just received word of a tragic turn of events at the bush funeral party
it seems that mr
bush has been shot
i repeat mr
felix bush has been shot
there is no word of condition
the radio is playing but we dont know where mattie is
when i know more i will let you know
im sure he would appreciate your prayers
bush stands at the mirror his shirt unbuttoned and pulled back
the bullet caught the muscle just above his clavicle
buddy frank and charlie rush in
close the door
charlie slams the door
frank examines the wound
buddy stares in shock at the old roping burns scars on bushs chest
missed the bone
got any alcohol and clean rags
bush nods at the cabinet
charlie finds an amazing assortment of herbs and roots alcohol and old sheets ripped into rags
why dont you sit down sir
boil some water and ill tell you how to make me a poultice
frank takes the rags and alcohol from charlie this is gonna hurt
dont sugar coat it
everyone is standing around in shock
kathryn waits anxiously near the porch with the baby
horton steps up to the microphone
the shocked crowd turns to him
he closes his eyes and bows his head
lord you say you move in mysterious ways and we believe you because we dont understand much of anything
and so we come to you today not seeking answers to whats happened here but asking you to help us open our hearts a little more to each other and
find some forgiveness and understanding
frank has cleaned the wound
buddy has made a poultice that bush is pressing onto the wound as he hears the last of hortons prayer over the loudspeakers
pretty good prayer
mighta been wrong about that preacher
why dont you lay down felix
bush thinks about it sees a way out
for a second he looks like he might take it
then he shakes his head puts a rag over the poultice and pulls his shirt up
lets go fore i lose my nerve
are you sure
bush scowls at the huge blood stain on his shirt
he looks at franks white shirt
frank just stares at him
bush keeps looking
finally frank sighs and starts loosening his tie
the bluegrass band sings a good hymn
the crowd is still stunned and talking not knowing what to do
buddy gently helps bush into his jacket which has a bullet tear in it along the shoulder but bush seems okay with it to franks relief
frank is putting on an old faded shirt of bushs
as bush starts for the door he comes up beside charlie
you aint nervous
all them white folks out there
theres white folks here
stick with me youll be all right
youre the one theyre shooting at
as charlie opens the door bush stops all his misgivings flooding in with the light
he looks at buddy
pretty interesting day so far huh boy
bush straightens himself up and goes out the door
charlie bush walk through the murmuring parting crowd toward the stage
frank and buddy are close behind
buddy is looking for kathryn
she spots him and moves toward the stage
bush and charlie go up the steps to the stage
at the last second bush stares at the big microphone and stops unable to go on
charlie gives him a look then goes on up to the microphone and looks out a the sea of white folks
im reverend charlie jackson
felix wants to continue with his funeral
and hes asked me to say a few words
just below the stage buddy and frank are joined by kathryn
charlie glances back at bush turns inward searching for the words
finally he holds his hands out wide apart
we like to imagine that good and bad right and wrong are miles apart
but the truth is very often theyre
brings his hand together and laces his fingers all tangled up with each other
bush raises his head and looks at charlies back
some years ago felix bush dropped into my life and then dropped out
in between he built the most beautiful sanctuary that ive ever seen
a lot of wonderful things happened in that church
suddenly bush breaks away moves up beside charlie and puts his hand on his shoulder
thank you charlie
charlie gives him a long look then steps away from the microphone and moves back to where bush was standing
bush stares at the microphone takes a breath and walks up to it and looks out over the huge crowd
had to go clear to illinois to find somebody that had anything good to say about me
hell of a thing
his voice booms out over the crowd startling him
he looks down sees buddy kathryn frank and horton
he looks closer for someone most important but she is not there
the crowd murmurs
im not a smart man or a wise one
i dont know what kind of man i am
i was always restless thought id see the world
but i didnt hardly go nowhere
because i did something that i was ashamed of
something i couldnt ever fix
yall probably think you know what youd do or what you wouldnt
and i wish you good luck with that
i really do
when i told charlie what id done he told me to confess to god and the law and to
to someone else
so i could get forgiveness
but i didnt want forgiveness
i needed to hold on to what i did
to be sick from it every day of my life
so i never told nobody else
he stops not knowing how to go on
the crowd has quieted completely
as as his eyes sweep over the sea of expectant faces he suddenly sees her coming through the crowd
seeing that felix appears to alright her face changes from conflicted concern to open unbridled hatred
the look takes bushs breath away
but he suddenly seems to accept it as his due and when he talks it is only to her
i fell in love with a married lady
and somehow she fell in love with me
it was the only time that i have been in love
we made a plan to run off and start a new life but she didnt show up at the time that we said wed meet
i got a funny feeling and i went to her house
buddy kathryn and frank all see mattie now see bush talking just to her
her husband answered the door
he had blood on him
for mattie all of this is like window into the past being suddenly thrown open and she is haunted and mesmerized
i hit him pretty hard knocked him down
cant remember going upstairs but i remember i saw a hammer on the steps and it had blood and hair on it
the crowd gasps
mattie is trembling
i found her in the bedroom
she was crawling across the floor
but before i could get to her and help her up
a kerosene lamp hit the wall
and then her husband jumped on my back
funny what happens sometimes when things go wrong
its like the clock stops and you have all the time in the world to think
i could see that her husband had set the downstairs on fire before he came up
and as i was slamming his head into the wall trying to get shed of him i could see clear as anything that it was all my fault
if id just never spoke to her
and as i was thinking about that i saw that the lamp he threw had set the room we were in on fire too
bush forces himself to keep looking into mattie
and then i realized that i was on fire
i tried to put myself out but i couldnt everything was
i dropped him turned around and saw her lying on the floor and called her name
she looked up at me
and the next thing i knew i was flying
a loud roar of fire and crushing timbers
a man on fire bursts through the second story window of a burning house
he lands hard and rolls across the yard to smother the flames
with his clothes still smoking he unbelievably tries to run back into the hell
but the fire is too hot and he cannot
he screams like a mad man and runs into the trees
the crowd is motionless
nothing is moving
it is as if the whole world has stopped
frank buddy and kathryn are frozen
bush and mattie are looking into each other one anguished soul to another
i dont know how i got out the window
no matter how many times i play it in my mind i cant remember jumping
i thought i killed him but maybe he pushed me i dont know
lost as ever
i swear to you if i left her in there
everything i know about myself is a lie
but that dont matter
i didnt get her out little bit i didnt
bush sits on the edge his bed
his face is drawn and haunted
the door open and closes
he doesnt look up
mattie sits down beside him
tears are streaming down her face
she lays her head gently on his shoulder
he sniffs her hair and tenderly touches it
wonder if her hair would be white
a man chooses a winning raffle ticket from a wire cage
a poor young couple with several children win the raffle
the promise of a new and better life begins for them
the big funeral party breaks up people wind their way home
the big old honking generator coughs off
mule is lead back to the barn
the equipment is disassembled and loaded back on the truck
the microphone stands alone on the stage
he got it said
buddy frank horton charlie and kathryn and the baby wait outside giving bush and mattie time
buddy takes the baby and holds it close
finally mattie and bush come out of the shack and walk down to the others
no one knows what to say
how you doing sir
just fair son
carl said ray paid them to set the fire
paid them to break into the funeral home too
cant stop pulling aces out of his ass can he
spend his money on lawyers now
you know how thrifty they are
frank motions to buddy and they go to bush
buddy is still holding the baby bush looks tenderly at buddy and the baby
whats his name
larry lawrence after my dad sir
he aint gonna throw rocks at me is he
not if knows whats good for him
you boys did good
lets settle up
we dont have to do that now
you get some rest
a look then yeah
well come out tomorrow
bring my shirt back i just got it broke in
bush pulls buddy aside
frank stares over at them but cant hear what they are saying
he moves over beside mattie
are you alright mattie
she looks up at frank for a long moment her face softening
oh i dont know
im still moving i guess
he doesnt know what that means but she has finally really looked at him and thats something hell hold onto
kathryn comes and hugs mattie as
bush and buddy come back
bush goes to charlie
frank is staring at buddy looking for a clue as to what bush said
buddy gives him nothing thanks again for coming charlie
im proud of you
thank you for my church
did you ever get my bill
can we get a ride our cars about miles down the road
everyone piles into the hearse
there is no back seat so they all have to crawl in the back door and sit along the sides
it makes everyone smile
mattie gives bush one last fleeting embrace then climbs in
bush looks in on them all for a long moment all then closes the door
as the hearse moves out he waves to buddy who is looking out the back window
buddy waves back
look at that
my funeral and everybodys in there but me
the hearse pulls onto the road and drives away
the place is suddenly quiet and beautiful
he looks down the road through the fading dust and sees a woman walking slowly toward him
he squints recognizes her and his face fills with a timeless love
its a cold day beneath the spreading pecan tree
mule stands hitched to the wagon
the three dog grave markers are frosted
a fourth grave marker just like the others leans against the tree
it is freshly carved with felix elijah bush
a pot of fresh yellow flowers sit beside the marker
bushs beautiful handmade casket is inside his grave
frank mattie charlie buddy kathryn and horton stand beside the grave
several men with shovels wait near the tree
charlies eulogy is more of a one sided conversation which bush would probably love
well felix this ones for real i guess
i didnt actually see them put you in the box so
charlie glances over and notices charlie on one of the dogs grave markers
he snorts and shakes his head
wherever you are youre probably giving someone a hard time or something wonderful and priceless just to confuse them
not everything can be figured out nor everybody
i wish you peace from the burdens of your mind and heart
i wish it for us all
mattie moves toward the edge of the grave
frank puts a hand out to catch her should she should stumble
she stares down at the fb on the coffin opens her hand and lets the picture of her sister drift down onto the coffin
everyone moves away as the men fill in the grave
buddy and kathryn move up beside frank and mattie and charlie
buddy tosses the ball of hermit money to frank
a on the outside all ones inside
i told you
nobody listens to the preacher
buddy pulls some papers from his coat
the day of the party he told me about the will he had in the secret drawer of his table
he left the raffle money to all of us
everyone is shocked touched
but you have to pay for mules upkeep for the rest of his life
charlie grins and buddy flaps the papers at him
and he set up a fund for the upkeep of your church
whats the catch
no catch sir
still dont get it do you
with felix theres always a catch
maybe he just knew youd go crazy wondering what it was
they all laugh and move down the hillside
as the laughter fades we see in their faces the impact that felix bush has had upon them
buddy feels the comfort of this odd but growing family and stops and looks back at the grave and the pot of yellow flowers
his curiosity about the fearsome old man has not abated
nor will it ever
