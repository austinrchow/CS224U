b if window
href b b the deer hunter the plant is massive grime streaked squatting in the valley under five massive stacks each one trailing a black ribbon across the winter sky
fires can be seen flickering through the windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops of guyed metal flues
steam rises in clouds from vents and chimneys and the sound of it all the hissing the clanging the rumbling the shrieking comes faintly muted by the falling snow
in the foreground is a street columbine street which inhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directly down the hillside straight at the mill
columbine is a sad looking street a grim looking street a street hanging on by the skin of its teeth
dilapidated stores hug the narrow sidewalks
battered signs squeak in the wind
sandwiched between the stores and scattered on twisting roads along the hillside are narrow victorian houses
these houses which run to three stories or more in height all seem on the verge of toppling over and undoubtedly would except that they are all connected one to
another by a mad arrangement of utility lines which cross and re cross between them with occasional aid from a leaning pole
music comes up dissonant rather frightening music as we watch a car come charging up through the slush on columbine street
as it nears camera the car falters on the slippery grade and slides out of sight
a figure appears huddled against the driving snow
the figure disappears as a white hot ingot shoots out of an ejecting mechanism and comes ripping down a track
another ingot follows it and another and another and another
the ingots are huge trembling with heat and they come on with a terrifying rumble
under credits we see steelworkers catching the ingots with tongs and deftly swinging them into troughs
the steelworkers wear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist
warped in heat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figures in some hellish ballet
since they all wear goggles it is hard to distinguish between them but there are three who are young who seem to work with particular grace
these are nick sal and merle
camera closes on nick sal and merle
the noise is deafening the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come on with murderous speed
taking advantage of a slight pause merle jabs nick and they both make cuckolds horns at sal
sal blushes and waves them off with his hand
merle and nick make the horns again and now sal puts both hands on his hips gives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed
merle and nick begin laughing
sal cant hold out and he starts laughing too but now the ingots begin roaring down the track again and they all grab their tongs
a very old priest is making preparations for a wedding ceremony
sals mother hovers around him as he unlocks a cabinet and takes out white tapers and a golden crown which will be used in the service
the priest moves with agonizing slowness and sals mother is in the midst of a bad case of nerves
its all ready
are you sure everythings ready
are you positive
it would snow
everythings going to slip
everythings going to slide
all the cars are going to crash
sals mother puts her hand to her mouth and bursts into tears
i cant believe this
my own little boy
with a stranger
the priest smiles
he takes sals mother in his arms and comforts her
another car lunges up the hill gets about halfway and slides back
as the car disappears the door to one of the houses bursts open and a group of giggling bridesmaids begin scampering across the street
they have all been working on their dresses which are not completely finished and they all carry ribbons and scissors and pieces of material
as they make their way to the other side of the street they all wave away the snowflakes and grab each other for support
one of the bridesmaids loses her dress entirely and with everyone laughing she rushes back to retrieve it in her slip
when the garment is repossessed a door comes open and the bridesmaids disappear inside
camera holds on columbine street
the snow slants across the little stores and piles on the gables of the tipsy little houses
another car appears lunges at the hill and slides back
suddenly the door to the bakery comes open and a group of older women emerge carrying a huge wedding cake with a miniature bride and groom standing on the top
the women are all in their fifties and bundled in boots and dark overcoats
they begin moving slowly up the street in the driving snow with the great white cake held firmly between them
the time clocks are lined against both walls
as a whistle screams to mark the end of the shift thousands of men begin checking out
nick sal and merle are right up in the front ranks and once they have clocked their cards they gather together along the wall
calls hey albert
albert six and a half feet tall and built like an ox changes course and plows across the river of homeward bound how you feelin sal
i feel okay
arm around sal humpers ready
old humpers hottern damn hell
get him albert
ill get him
albert wades back into the stream of steelworkers grabs vince and they all push out together
the snow is still falling
it covers the ground
it covers the acres of parked cars
it swirls and tosses and blows
as the five friends come bursting out of a side exit they all stop dead in their tracks
holy shit snow
sal gives a look at the others
something is going on
vince is so excited he begins hopping around
do you know what this means
do you guys realize exactly what this means
they all know
they all know damn well
merle and nick exchange looks
what are you guys
are you guys going hunting
the others nod shrug shuffle their feet
they are all a little embarrassed

envious you guys are crazy

he makes a gesture with his hand
with a laugh cmon
cmon you guys
they all start into the swirling snow
nick with an arm around sal
and we want you to know sal that any help you might need yeah sal willing fingers extra feet
the place is large and drafty and rundown
a huge american flag hangs from the middle of the ceiling
under it women are laying white table cloths on trestle tables
off to one side a half dozen old men wearing vfw hats are scotch taping paper ribbons to the brick wall
two old men are on stepladders two more are bracing the ladders and the operation is under the direction of a pair of world war i vets standing side by
their hands tremble
their four eyes loom huge behind corrective lenses
up i would say
what would you say
signals up ribbon
one end of the ribbon is moved up
the two vets study it
down i would say
what would you say
signals down ribbon
suddenly there is a commotion
the women who are setting up the tables all rush to the door as the older women come in with the wedding cake
the older women look half frozen and as they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus of uhhs and ahhs
suddenly one of the older women collapses
friends rush to her aid seat her in a chair and give her wine
the woman takes the glass tosses it off in one swallow and grins
a big battered old shark finned black cadillac approaches coming fast
nick sal merle vince and albert are all laughing
nick is at the wheel
hit it nick
hit it baby
the car bangs over potholes and slams into the grade
we watch as it reaches the half way point then the three quarter mark
nick bends forward over the wheel peering out through the slapping wipers
chanting do it nick
go nick go
do it nick
the car fishtails loses speed
to a creep
all hands to the rear
albert and merle who are sitting in front immediately throw themselves into the back seat on top of sal and vince
ats it easy
the cadillac inches up the last ten feet gains level ground and skids to a stop
from inside comes a muted cheer
angela is dressed in her white bridal gown and veil
she is plump pretty with a solemn round face and big brown eyes
angela leans forward into a mirror
sincerely i do
angela scowls and tries it again
heartfelt i do
angela tries it a few more times
it sounds worse and worse
i do i do i do
angela stares at herself
now she looks desperate and unrelievedly forlorn
bursting into tears she throws herself on the bed
someone has slipped a photograph under the pillow
the photograph is face down and as angela pulls it out she sees that something is written on the back reading slow this is it more or less
angela frowns turns the photograph over
it is a picture of michaelangelos david
angela stares at the figure for a long long moment
the place is packed with boisterous steelworkers drinking boilermakers
deerheads are mounted in a long row over the bar and hand painted murals decorate the walls
the murals depict hunting scenes and display an eerie tone at once comical and frightening as if the animals held some secret from the hunters some power beyond their own
john bangs out from behind the bar with a tray of beer
at the same moment sal comes in with nick merle albert and vince
john who is a great bear of a youth puts down his tray wraps his arms around sal and begins jumping him around the floor grinning ear to ear
the steelworkers turn desert their places and swarm around sal joking and shouting congratulations
linda is thin a skinny slip of a thing with a hauntingly lovely face
wearing her bridesmaids dress she stands alone in the kitchen staring at the ceiling
thumping noises are coming from the room above
the thumping gets louder
there is a crash then another crash as if furniture were being thrown around
a mans voice begins cursing and there is more thumping and crashing
suddenly there is a thud
and then silence
linda bites her lip
she crosses to the stove ladles stew into a bowl butters bread pours a cup of tea and puts it all on a tray
the room is a wreck of broken furniture
chairs are turned over lamps are smashed and the pictures hang cockeyed on the wall
in the middle of the room face down on the floor is lindas father
his coat is torn one shoe is missing and he holds a half empty bottle in his hand
behind him through the open window snow is blowing in
linda comes in with the tray
she stands for a moment expressionless looking down at her father
then she sets the tray on the bureau and kneels beside him
linda reaches down takes her father by the shoulder and rolls him over
it takes some effort and the face that comes up is gray unshaven and implacably bitter
saliva dribbles from his mouth there is a cut with the stitches still in it seaming his forehead and as linda looks at him he begins cursing again
all around like a sea
like an ocean
linda gets up and closes the window
she comes back gets down on the floor beside her father and pushes him toward the bed
then hiking up her bridesmaids dress she takes him by the shoulders again and heaves him onto the coverlet
the effort is almost too much for her
tears begin to burn in her eyes but when he slips back she tries again
the father groans begins to mumble and then when she almost has him on the bed he suddenly lifts his hand catches her full in the face and pushes her
violently across the room
linda crashes backwards over a fallen chair and smashes into the wall
as she gets to her feet her father advances on her
he swings catches her in the face again hard
daddy its me
lindas father swings at her again loses his balance and falls on the floor
linda stands looking at him holding her jaw
she is crying
tears are streaming down her face
seven musicians carrying their instruments file silently through the falling snow
the women are all gathered some fifteen or twenty ranging from grandmothers to young wives
about half of them wield rolling pins or heavy pans
as the last reinforcements arrive two hefty ladies with truncheons a roar of laughter comes from inside
nick sal merle vince albert and john are dancing
the music is at top volume and the smoke is thick enough to cut with a knife
suddenly from the back comes a chorus of screeches and female recriminations
the door to the alley bursts open and the hefty ladies with truncheons appear
the steelworkers take one look gulp their drinks grab their heads in their hands and rush for the front door
the steelworkers stream into the snow with the women close behind
several blows are delivered and the howls of complaint are met with angry commands to hurry and get dressed for sals wedding
camera closes on sal who emerges with nick and merle
the snow hits him a sobering blow and he comes to a stop
boy this is it
this is really it
here i go
sals mother hurries out of the alley
she is crying
my beautiful boy
who is leaving his own mother
she throws herself in sals arms sobbing
so cold is your heart to leave your own mother
momma ill be right upstairs
sal throws a look to nick and merle
they gesture with sympathy and study the snow flakes
so cruel is your heart
is your heart so uncaring
a litany now one flight momma
its one flight
the trailer is a dented two tone pink and cream job which looks as if it had been purchased third hand off a construction site
it stands on cinder blocks in a small lot which has been cut out of the side of the hill
a wrecked school bus decorates it to the right
on the left is a bare branched tree
nicks black cadillac is parked in front and a light shows from inside the trailer
camera picks up merle who is strolling toward the trailer whistling through his teeth
he is wearing his tuxedo and carries a knapsack and a deer rifle
he mounts the cinder block steps and pounds on the trailer door
nick opens the door and waves him in
the place is cramped littered with camping paraphernalia
a deer head is mounted above the sink and nick who is half into his tuxedo is applying waterproofing to a pair of heavy boots
merle smiles throws his kit on the stove and sits
indicates the waterproofing you should have put that on last night
that way it sets
i just wait
i just wait

nick grins takes down his rifle and begins wiping the oil off it

nick opens the door
john and albert both in tuxedoes and loaded down with gear are pounding on the trunk of the cadillac trying to get it open
nick and merle go out

vince comes up also in tuxedo and dragging a totally disorganized clutter of hunting gear behind him
alberts gonna hump the coup de ville
albert looks around at his friends
he surveys the back end of the cadillac with simian pride
then he expands his chest thumps on it with both fists and yodels out a magnificent mile carrying tarzan call
as the echo of it comes back the church bell begins ringing down the street and a group of excited bridesmaids come hurrying up
albert what are you doing
hurry up you guys
whos got their carnations
theyre right here
look at you
youre all a mess
put on their carnations
whos got a pin
as the bridesmaids begin straightening ties and putting on carnations nick hears someone call his name
he turns to find linda standing beside the trailer where she cant be seen
she looks pale and very frightened and she holds a small suitcase in her hand
forces a smile nick your shoes are soaking
linda whats the matter
tries to toss it off oh
she fights against it but the tears begin to come
nick looks around pulls her inside the trailer
nick clears a place on the couch
linda sits holding her suitcase in her lap
with great effort i was just wondering
youre going hunting
if i could use this place to stay because
are you kidding
id want to pay you
and i was thinking kneels in front of her linda
i would want to pay you nick
and i was thinking linda linda
very small looking into his eyes what

after a long long moment okay
linda nods a solemn nod
lindas lip begins to tremble
tears stand in her eyes and she gives a little toss of her head
who else dummy
nick stares at her
he can still hardly believe it
this is terrific
this is really terrific
she is suddenly excited suddenly radiantly happy
she takes the suitcase off her lap and throws herself in nicks arms
i dont know what weve been waiting for
eyes closed loving him i dont know
i dont know either
sal and angela stand facing each other as the priest reads the holy sacrament of marriage
blessed be the kingdom
now and forever unto ages and ages
as the priest continues with the holy sacrament camera picks up faces in the congregation
we see sals family
we see angelas family
we see the vets from the v
we see the steelworkers from the bar and the wives and mothers who chased them home to change
they are hard faces working class faces but we sense a fortitude among the congregation a community of both heart and spirit
camera picks up nick merle vince albert and john standing in a row opposite the bridesmaids
the guys all look slightly disheveled
their tuxedos are all too small and their shoes are soaking wet from walking in the snow
nick catches lindas eye and they hold each other across the intervening space like two children who are amazed
the priest hands white tapers to the bride and groom
camera closes slowly on the priest
the man is impressive gentle yet full of power
the priest lights the tapers first angelas then sals and looks out across the assembled congregation
for everyone that does evil hates the light and does not come to the light lest his deeds will be reproved
save for a lone figure trudging home the street is deserted left to the gently falling snow
in the background the massive silhouette of the steel mill is plainly visible lit with fire
nick merle vince albert and john join with the bridesmaids to assist the priest in the crowning of sal and angela
the priest crowns sal first
the servant of god sal is crowned for the servant of god angela in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
now angela is crowned
the servant of god angela is crowned for the servant of god sal in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
guiding the couple by their joined hands the priest leads sal and angela around the analoy
the movement is very precise very formal a circling to represent eternity
the band is going full blast and the whirling couples young and old are laughing
we see sal and angela nick and linda vince albert and john
the only one of the group not dancing is merle
merle is drinking standing alone on the side of the floor chugging beer in tense rapid fire gulps
we sense immediately that he feels out of place at a loss to join spontaneously in the spirit of the party
merle finishes the beer crumples the can and starts on another
as he picks up the second can he notices that a sad looking girl is sitting against the wall behind him waiting for someone to ask her to dance
the sad looking girl gives merle a smile
merle pretends not to see and moves behind a post
the wedding cake that was carried in earlier has now been attacked from all sides but the miniature bride and groom are still standing in the middle
unnoticed by each other sals mother and angelas mother eye the little figures
both women are in rather teary condition and begin moving toward the cake
suddenly as the crowd shifts they encounter each other face to face
smiles are exchanged strained smiles which get stretched and stretched and stretched
then in unison they desert the smiling and remove their respective offspring from the cake
sals mother looks down at her sugar coated groom and angelas mother looks down at her sugar coated bride
then they eye each other burst into tears and throw themselves in each others arms moaning and sobbing
another couple tries to enter the rack
it is pretty full
they finally find an empty place and squeeze in
nick comes off the floor with linda and throws an arm around sit with linda man will ya
give her a beer
to linda with great solicitude would you like a beer
what kind of beer would you like
laughing i dont know
to merle give her millers
millers high life
nick takes off
linda sits down at a table and merle goes to the cooler to get a millers
he gropes around in the tub finds one and pops the tab
suddenly he notices that nick has crossed to the sad looking girl by the wall
he has stopped in front of her and is asking her something
the sad looking girl gives a blush gets out of her chair and nick takes her in his arms and begins to dance
the sad looking girl looks transformed
she begins chattering and laughing
merle crosses back to linda and gives her the beer
as he pulls up a chair to sit down beside her he stumbles and nearly loses his balance
he is very drunk
laughs its okay merle
nick swings by with the sad looking girl and waves
catching lindas expression i guess you like nick
merle doesnt say anything for a moment
he seems to be trying to contain a floodtide of emotion
clears his throat fuckin nick
he nods bangs his fist on the table gives
fuckin nick gives
the rack is still jammed with couples but the laughing and giggling has now given way to the sound of heavy breathing and low moans
what light there is comes from the colored glass ball revolving above the dance floor where the music is now playing sweet and low
the front door comes open and a u
army sergeant steps into the darkened hallway
the man wears his dress green uniform
on his chest is a row of battle ribbons and his shoes are brightly polished
the sergeant gives a beery chuckle and moves toward the dance floor
the sergeant passes between groups of celebrating guests plucks a beer from one of the coolers and sits down alone at the end of one of the white trestle tables
albert gives his tarzan cry suddenly picks his girl off her feet and marches around holding her above his head
albert what are you doing
vince and john are standing together
vince is going bananas because his girl marsha is dancing too close to fred
look at that see
wait a minute watch

vince marches up and taps fred on the shoulder
fred releases marsha
marsha waits one hand on her hip while the two of them exchange words
vince turns marsha points to her ass
fred turns marsha pints to the small of her back
vince is hopping up and down now
so is fred
marsha who is getting bored points to the door
vince and fred bang out
as soon as they have gone marsha is taken by someone else who puts his hand right back where fred had it
nick sal and merle are standing together looking at the nick he just came back
see that ribbon in the left
thats quan son
that fucking guy was at quan son
merle gestures with his head
nick and sal cross with him to the sergeant

the sergeant looks at them and delivers a big blank smile
the sergeant keeps smiling
to nick whatd he say
clears his throat uh
well maybe you could tell us how it is over there
merle looks at nick
nick looks at sal
they all begin scratching their heads trying not to laugh
well thanks a lot
they turn away and then when they are out of earshot they all break up howling
who the hell is he
who the hell knows
is he from here
well wheres he from
in unison who the hell knows
soberly maybe hes lost
throws up his hands well i dont know
the guests have formed in a long double line which extends from the dance floor right out into the street
everyone is pretty drunk and they are all armed with streamers and bags of rice
as sal and angela appear from out of a back room there is a great rowdy cheer
the musicians strike up a march
followed by the musicians showered with streamers rice advice and encouragement sal and angela walk the gauntlet toward the street where a glossy bright red pontiac with headers and straight
pipes is being revved in a series of ear splitting crescendos
john albert merle and vincent are standing by the door
their tuxedos are stained and torn
their carnations are squashed and their clip on bow ties are either missing entirely or dangling from the open collars of their shirts
vince looks the worst with a black eye and half his pant leg torn away and they are all guzzling beer
you wanna bet
thats bullshit and ill betcha
youre fulla shit
how much do you wanna bet
bet him vince
ill betcha twenty dollars
sal and angela emerge to more cheers and a shower of streamers and rice
angela is helped into the pontiac on the right
nick throws an arm around sal and walks him around to the drivers seat
dont worry what it says in the book
just forget that
forget what it says in the book
im gonna start slow
at the top
then im gonna work down
thats my plan
nick gives sal a hug
sal gets in the car
see you monday
see you monday
sal looks over at angela
all set hon
sal puts the car into gear and starts slowly off
fists pound on the car
rice and streamers shower down
suddenly through the front windshield merle appears stark naked running in front of the car with colored paper streamers floating out from his upraised right hand
for a split second sal cannot believe what he is seeing
he throws a look at angela
angela covers her mouth in amazement and then quickly shifts the hand to cover her eyes
merle weaves down the street in front of the growling red pontiac
merle is not just running
he is leaping and bounding as if released from gravity and entered into a realm of pure ethereal space
nick albert vince and john pound down the street behind the pontiac albert carrying merles clothes
look at that
the road forks one road going high to a parking area the other descending to the valley below
merle swerves up the incline toward the parking area while the pontiac goes straight and disappears down the hill
albert vince and john stagger to a stop panting helplessly
nick grabs merles clothes from albert and takes off up the hill
merle stands motionless looking out across the valley as nick approaches
the night is brilliantly clear and the fires from the mill light up the sky with an eerie glow
nick comes to a stop a few feet away
his face has a strange distant look and he gives nick an almost feral grin
you think well ever come back
startled from nam
nick moves up beside him
he doesnt know what to say
i love this fuckin place
that sounds crazy
i know that sounds crazy but i love this fuckin place
if anything happens nick dont leave me there
i mean it
dont leave me
you gotta promise nick
you gotta promise me that
half laughing merle promise
you gotta promise
you got it
merle lets out his breath
it is as if some great weight had been pressing on him
with a laugh lets go huntin
i mean lets do it
nicks battered old shark finned cadillac comes screaming past
nick merle vince albert and john all of them still in tuxedos are jammed in the car between knapsacks sleeping bags six packs of beer and deer rifles
singing let me be free
let me be free
will let me be free
always be happy
with me e e e
making a trumpet sound wa wa wa
tale cadillac comes blasting by
nick is hunched over the wheel his eyes gone completely glassy
merle and vince are on the nod while albert and john both half asleep are having a lead voiced conversation
she fucked you
she fucked me
she fucked me too
she fucked you
she fucked me too
there is a long pause
they both struggle to keep their eyes open
she fucked us both
fucking women man
shakes his head i know
nicks head is sunk below the upper rim of the steering wheel
one eye is entirely shut and the open one seems close to death
suddenly his head snaps up
he slams his foot down on the brake and the cadillac fishtails rubber screaming to a jolting stop
everyone in the car comes awake ten bleary eyes staring out through the windshield
there are deer in the road fifteen or twenty of them standing in the headlights
vince albert nick and john pile out with their rifles
vince immediately slips and falls down
for christ sake get em
whos got the ammo
get the ammo
ill get it
where is it
its in the trunk
its in the trunk
im telling you its in the trunk
vince albert and john rush around to the trunk
albert begins pounding on it
hit it there
pushing and shoving each other vince albert and john rush around to the side of the car
as they pass along the embankment at the side of the road there is a soft sound like a sigh and all three of them simultaneously vanish
nick who has been watching stares at the place where his three friends disappeared
he takes a few steps forward realizes what has happened and doubles up in the middle of the road helpless with laughter
getting out of the car man lets go hunting
where are they
nick makes a gesture a downward pointing of his finger
vince crosses to the side of the road
the slope is a good plus
at the bottom barely visible three tiny figures flop in the snow
vince looks down at the three hunters with an expression of absolute disgust
he looks at nick flat on his back pounding his feet howling and then he looks at the deer
the deer are still watching
if anything they have edged closer and their massed expression of polite curiosity throws vince into a blind rage
get out of here damn you
vince whose rifle is fully loaded slams a shell into the chamber and lets off a barrage of shots above the deer
the sky is cold first light with low wind driven clouds
camera tilts down and we see nicks cadillac coming up a narrow road flanked by precipitous heavily forested ridges on both sides
the cadillac seems minuscule overwhelmed by the massive black slopes looming up from the road
everyone is eating cold hot dogs ripping them out of a half dozen plastic packages dipping them in a jar of mustard and stuffing them down
hot dog juice has dripped over everything potato chips are littered everywhere and both beer and milk are being passed around
those are mine
you want em
gimme a hostess twinkie merle
heres a hershey
albert tears off the wrapper dips it in the mustard and glomps it down
mouth jammed full what
you just put mustard on your hershey bar
pass the beer
pointing to a location beside the road here here
this is it
milk slopping over him watch it shithead
pounds nick on the shoulder here
this is it

now you passed it

its ahead vince
that isnt it
theres no way thats it
unless they changed it
they might have changed it
nick pulls to a stop on the shoulder
they changed it
thats what they did
this is it but they changed it
the sky is just turning grey
a cold wind is blowing moaning in the trees and swirling a fine haze of snow across the open roadway
the guys all pile out in their wrecked tuxedos
this is it
this is it but they changed it
youre full of shit
whos full of shit
youre full of shit
im telling you they changed it
they did not
they did too
jesus its freezing
nick merle and john have the trunk open and are taking stuff out
merle strips down where he stands and begins putting on his hunting clothes
albert and vince grab their things and follow the example of nick and john who are changing on the corner of the seats
merle hey merle you got any socks
merle who is crouched down studying the hillside looks over
rummaging around in the mess of things he has brought never mind merle
never mind i got em
where the hell are my pants
anyone see my pants
who the hell took my pants
vince begins plunging around
somebody took my pants
i know i brought pants
vince tears into another pile of equipment comes up with nothing and steps out of the car
all right you guys
whoever took my pants i want em back
shots are ringing out in the hills
nick albert and john stand by the roadside while vince and merle glare at each other
vince is still in his tuxedo pants is still wearing his dress shoes and is draped in a gigantic red goose down vest that could only have come from albert
merles knapsack lies on the ground in front of him and we can see that it contains a pair of vibram soled mountain boots
sure i got boots
i got boots right here
then lemme have em
both hands in the air no

john throws up his hands in a comical way
ill get the boots
in agreement get the boots
crossing to merles knapsack i mean lets get going before merle who has remained completely calm throughout vinces tirade pumps a shell in the chamber of his rifle
john freezes in his tracks and stares at him his face gone white
i said no
john looks at albert who is right behind him and they both back away
vince who is standing directly opposite merle begins to tremble
his mouth comes open closes and comes open again
urine begins trickling out from the bottom of his pants leg staining the snow
suddenly nick steps forward
he looks at merle crosses to the knapsack takes out the boots walks over to vince and throws them on the road
gently to merle lets hunt
the place is about nine by twelve
the floor is rotted out boards are missing from the walls and the entire structure is canted to the right
hanging from the roof peak is a hissing coleman lantern which sways in the wind
vince albert and john are sacked out sound asleep
beer cans some old some new litter the floor
wet clothes most of them bloody hang from tie boards and nails
strung up on the end wall are two deer carcasses one of them with a knife jammed in it where steaks have been cut out
snow is blowing in dry crystal bright
it swirls over everything and settles on the sleeping figures on the floor
camera discovers merle and nick
they are both in sleeping bags lying on rusted bedsprings at either side of the broken door
the wind gusts and moans
the cabin shudders and then there is a sudden lull
tomorrow i go with vince
hunt with vince
i mean so he knows
he doesnt even know
traffic is heavy an unending flow of cars a river of headlights suspended on a curved concrete trestle which seems to float in thin air
behind is the mill belching steam and ablaze with fire
nicks cadillac appears horn blaring weaving through the traffic
the car sits low
trussed to the hood to the roof to the trunk are the carcasses of five deer
rope ends flutter and bang in the wind
the car shudders and thuds
inside grinning maniacally nick merle vince albert and john are all shouting and guzzling beer
the caddy appears swerving onto columbine with tires screaming and nick still leaning on the horn
the guys are all hanging out the windows shouting to friends whistling at girls and banging a triumphant tatoo on the doors
hey maxie whadya say
hey geraldine lets eat
nothin to it asshole
piece o fuckin cake
as the car ascends the grade the mill appears behind it seeming to loom upward under the pink streaked twilight sky
camera holds as the car comes toward it
the headlights blaze white like huge hungry stars and the eyes of the dead deer on the fenders glitter gold and green and red
albert leans out the window and gives his tarzan call
it the leaf is being eaten by an exotic looking insect
after each bite the insect lifts its head produces an exceedingly thoughtful expression and chews
there are twenty of them coming fast and low just over the tops of the trees
sunlight gleams on their paint and murderous looking rockets are packed to their bellies in fat clusters like eggs
suddenly in unison they fire the rockets
as the rockets streak away the lightened choppers shoot upward lost to sight
there is an eerie silence and then the hillside explodes vanishes in a sheet of smoke and flame two miles wide
a platoon of americans have been ambushed on the road
the bodies lie helter skelter headless armless legless guts spilled in the dirt
no one moves and there is absolute silence except for the low buzz of flies
lieutenant steps into sight
he gives a brusque command and v
soldiers step out of the jungle
the lieutenant bayonets a few of the fallen u
soldiers idly without much interest and then cracks a joke as he rubs his finger in the americans blood
soldiers laugh spear a few americans themselves and repeat the joke
there is a slight sound
lieutenant spins and gives a low command
fifty feet away there are three grass huts
he signals his soldiers to spread out and then he starts toward them
south vietnamese villagers women children and a few old men sit huddled in the semi darkness
the women hold their hands over their babies mouths
flies buzz and there is a look of stark terror in their faces
one of the fallen americans moves
camera closes on the soldier
his face is in the dirt and flies are nuzzling at a gash in his temple
the face is unshaven frighteningly gaunt but we recognize that it is merle
a womans scream comes from the direction of the huts
a shot rings out
merle pulls himself to his hands and knees and stands there on all fours like a dog
roust the villagers from their huts smashing them in the back with rifle butts
one of the soldiers emerges from a hut carrying two small babies upside down by their feet
one of the women cries out
the soldier gives her a kick swings one of her babies in the air and lets it go
the baby turns over and over against the blue sky
as the baby comes down another soldier catches it through the neck on the end of his bayonet
merle strips a b
from one of his dead companions slams a fresh clip in it jams two extras in his pants and starts for the grass huts
his movements are slow almost dreamlike and his face is expressionless like someone risen from the dead
the villagers about twenty of them have been formed in a line
as the soldiers look on the v
lieutenant walks up and down trying to extract information
the speared baby lies in the dust between the two groups
the second baby tries to play with it
the soldier who threw the dead baby in the air squats nearby and yawns
merle approaches between the huts
he takes a quick look around the corner finds the v
all bunched in a neat package and draws back
camera closes on merles eyes
they are cold dreaming things glittering blankly
merle spins out with the b
on full automatic
soldiers go down screaming arms and necks thrown back in a thin mist of spraying blood
there are five of them coming in low under the tops of nearby trees
the villagers stand motionless staring at the helicopters and frozen with terror
they start to run
and then they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm
merle stands alone with his b
surrounded by clouds of billowing black smoke
there is no sound but the rush of heated air and the faint crackle of flames
merles clothes are burning
flames are licking up his trouser legs and a blob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet
in front of merle the soldiers and the villagers lie in two charred heaps
the babies lie between them
both are motionless now like two roasted stones
an american lieutenant steps out from behind one of the burning huts
merle and the lieutenant spin on each other and then the lieutenant lowers his carbine
what the hell are you doing here
numb saving lives
more americans appear some twenty of them coming out of the trees in a long line
among them are nick and sal
move it out girls
move it out
the lieutenant heads down the line
nick stares at merle
merle turns and looks at nick
there is no recognition
he seems to be looking right through him
sal comes up behind nick
a shot rings out
the lieutenant goes down and suddenly the whole line of americans is caught in a murderous cross fire
grenades rain out of the trees
merle nick and sal dive for cover
out of the smoke v
soldiers begin to appear more and more of them swarming out of the jungle in scores
we are looking at the ground where three pits have been dug and fitted with bamboo gratings which are held down by stones
the ground is ankle deep in running mud and the pits are filled with water to within a foot of the bamboo gratings
in each of the pits are about a half dozen men south vietnamese and american
their hands grip the gratings and their eyes are hollow
other than an occasional groan there is only the sound of the falling rain
soldier trudges out of the jungle
as he reaches the pits he notices the hands curses and begins jumping up and down on the bamboo gratings
the hands disappear
as soon as one comes back the soldier stomps on it shrieking with laughter
then almost as an afterthought the soldier pulls down his pants and squats above the center grating
camera tilts slowly upward
we see the clearing in its totality
it is a raw hole hacked out of the jungle and contains only two structures
one is a large bamboo tiger cage with a few leaves tied to its top
the other is a small hut with a thatched roof
the walls of the hut are open and we can see v
guards moving about inside
a cry comes from the hut
there is the thud of a rifle butt on flesh and the cry abruptly stops
in the middle of the hut is an american kitchen table with a rose patterned plastic top
at opposite ends of the table are two chairs
a south vietnamese prisoner sits in one of the chairs
in the other chair facing him is merle
the south vietnamese has a welt on his head and one of the half dozen v
guards in the hut is screaming at him
in the middle of the table between the south vietnamese and merle is a single action
caliber revolver with an american eagle carved on its ivory grip
merle sits quietly waiting but his eyes are working taking in every detail of the scene
guard gives the south vietnamese a final cuff takes up the revolver with a dramatic flourish and loads one cartridge into the chamber
immediately the other guards begin placing bets
the guards are a ragged bunch wet half drunk on captured budweiser and it takes some time to straighten things out
merle looks off to his right we see more south vietnamese and american prisoners standing against the wall
most of them have been badly beaten and all have their elbows tied behind their backs
in among them standing beside one another are nick and sal
nick looks grey like a skinny ghost
sal is out of control sobbing quietly
the betting is now completed
in charge waves the around and calls for silence
then closing the cylinder containing the single bullet he points the revolver at the ceiling and clicks through the empty chambers until the revolver goes off with a roar
bits of thatch flutter down from the ceiling
guards shout enthusiastically and grin
merle sits motionless
the south vietnamese across the table from him begins shaking uncontrollably
in charge now reloads the revolver with one cartridge snaps the cylinder shut puts the gun on the table between merle and the south vietnamese and gives it a good
the revolver slows and finally comes to a stop pointing at merle
merle stares at it for a long beat
then he picks it up spins the cylinder cocks it puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger
the hammer falls on an empty chamber with a loud click
merle places the revolver back on the table and pushes it toward the south vietnamese
the south vietnamese begins to tremble again
fumbling horribly he finally manages to get the gun in his hand
he spins the cylinder cocks the hammer and puts the gun to his temple
the gun weaves around
the south vietnamese closes his eyes and pulls the trigger
there is a loud click
merle takes the revolver again
he spins it cocks it all in one smooth motion puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger
there is another click
merle pushes the gun back across the table
this time the south vietnamese takes it up with sudden confidence
he spins the cylinder cocks it puts it to his temple and pulls on the trigger
merle doesnt even blink
the guards begin hooting and laughing wiping pieces of brain from their clothes and merle watches them watches every gesture every movement
like a cat
a pile of bodies lie by the steps in the pouring rain
the bodies are both south vietnamese and american
their heads are all variously blown to pieces and several huge rats are already feeding on them
nick is at the table now opposite a south vietnamese
he holds the pistol by his chin spins the cylinder
his face is twitching dripping sweat and both he and his opponent are holding onto each others eyes as if they had been at it for a long time
nick raises the pistol to his temple clicks out
the guards murmur
nick pushes the pistol across the table
there are no americans left to play except sal
the sobbing has stopped but sal is shaking and trembling and his eyes wander around in their sockets as if they been cut loose
merle who lies on the floor nearby is trying to talk to sal
as he does so we hear the clicks coming from across the room and the excited murmurs of the guards as their betting choice survives another round
you can do it sal
listen to me sal
you have to do it
i want to go home merle
you have to think about this sal
listen to me sal
you have to think about this
tears again this is horrible
listen to me sal
if you dont do it theyll put you in the pit
if they put you in the pit sal youre gonna die
sal do you understand
nods merle i wanna go home
there is an explosion from the other end of the room
sals eyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering scream
the guards open a path and nick appears
his knees wont support him and the guard who is holding him throws him on the floor
listen to me sal
you have to do it
the guard who delivered nick jerks sal to his feet and drags him of f to the table
sal is thrown in the chair
a south vietnamese is placed opposite him
the south vietnamese is a kid even younger than sal and he is trembling with terror
hey listen you can do it
sal nods smiles believe me you can do it
we can both do it
then we go home see
then we go home
sal looks down
the pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle comes up pointing at the south vietnamese
the south vietnamese stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his eyes
the guards begin yelling at him urging him on and then sal gives him a smile of such unwavering faith that the south vietnamese picks up the gun fumbles the
cylinder around cocks it and puts it to his temple
for a moment sal and the south vietnamese look at each other
the south vietnamese is the south vietnamese boy squeezes the trigger
there is an sal sits motionless his jaw hanging open and his face formed in an expression of terrible puzzlement
then his face begins to move begins to twitch as if the muscles were trying to discover a frown
sal looks around
he looks back again at the place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry
a half dozen south vietnamese sit huddled together in the muck on the uphill side
a seventh lies sprawled on his back dead
the rain pours through the few leaves placed on the roof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of the floor
on the downhill side are sal nick and merle
sal is in a fetal position gripping his knees and rocking himself back and forth
his eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in an expression of horror as if he were still watching the boy at the table blow himself away
beside sal is nick
nick sits slumped against the bamboo
one knee is raised and he is picking at the threads of his trousers where they have torn at the knee
the pits are about twenty feet away
running mud and water gurgle into them coming out through shallow trenches on the downhill side
there are fewer hands than the day before far fewer
the nearest pit only has one pair and as merle watches he sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip
merle turns away from the pits
he looks down at sal then he looks at nick
his expression is one of exasperation as if he had been having a long argument
im telling you nick no ones going to come
what are you god
listen asshole its up to us
they bombed last night right
didnt they bomb
if they bombed last night they could bomb tonight
they could be up there right now
what are you hoping
i thought you might be praying

ive been working on sal since dawn nick
sals in a dream and he wont come out
from here on you gotta go for you
you hear me
a shout comes from the thatched hut
the south vietnamese whip around in fright
merle and nick turn
through the bars of the tiger cage we see the v
guards coming down from the thatched hut
the guards are all drinking beer again and the guard in charge is waving the pearl handled revolver
nick looks at merle
the sight has totally unnerved him
calm we gotta play with more bullets
we gotta play with more bullets nick
its the only way
more bullets in the gun
even more bullets in the gun
the trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up so that means we gotta play each other
numb with more bullets
against each other
are you crazy
are you fucking nuts
its the only chance weve got
nick stares at merle
rain is pouring off them in rivulets and the voices of the approaching guards are getting louder
how many bullets
watching him three bullets minimum
panic no way
no fucking way
evenly holding him with his eyes ill pick the moment nick
the game goes on until i move
when i start shooting go for the nearest guard and get his gun
when you get the ak open up
you got me
screaming the guards begin screaming orders from outside the cage and one of them lets off a blast of automatic rifle fire which shreds the bamboo roof just above the
nick and merle grab sal and drag him to the door
as the prisoners emerge from the tiger cage the guards smash them with their rifle butts screaming orders
in the melee sal is separated from nick and merle both of whom are knocked to the ground by furious blows
when they get to their feet they see that sal is wandering off alone in the direction of the pits
one of the guards spots sal and clubs him down
sal gets up and begins wandering off again
the guard clubs him down again turns to the guard in charge and begins complaining
the guard in charge dispatches a second guard to help the first and the two guards open the bamboo grating on one of the pits
merle turns to nick who is standing beside him
its up to you nick
now its up to you
sal has absolutely no comprehension of what is about to happen to him
his eyes are dreamy far away as if he had mentally transported himself to some distant place
there are great gashes in his head from the blows he has received and as he stands waiting in the pouring rain he looks exactly like a very small child
who has experienced some terrible confusion
suddenly the guard standing beside sal wrenches him around
we see the pit now close up
there are four bloated corpses floating in the muck
we sals face close up
he gives a cry and tries to turn away
we see the guards pick sal up screaming
we see the splash as sal hits the water and then we see him surface between the bloated corpses still screaming paddling desperately and trying to find something solid to
hod him up
nick stands motionless stunned listening to sals screams
merle has his attention focused on the guard in charge and when he glances in their direction merle slugs nick in the stomach and begins beating him furiously to the
nick struggles to his feet
merle attacks him again and now as the guard in charge comes over to see whats going on merle begins hopping up and down pointing at nick pointing at the
revolver in the guards hand and screaming
him and me
him and me
the guards look at each other interested
him and me goddamn it
him and me
merle and nick sit facing one another across the rose patterned kitchen table
the guards are all grinning and even the south vietnamese are watching with grim fascination
nick has the revolver
he is trembling visibly
already merle has managed to draw the guards in closer and as nick spins the cylinder and cocks the hammer merle jumps up and begins pounding on the table
this is it motherfuckers
now hes going to do it
nick almost loses what little control is left and his hand begins shaking violently
look at him
this is it and he knows it
side bets begin changing hands
last chance to lose your money there guys
here he goes
nick puts the revolver against his temple and pulls the trigger
there is a dull click
nick puts the revolver back on the table
his hand is shaking so badly it falls with a clunk
merle grabs it spins it sticks it to his temple and clicks out talking all the time this is stupid
you understand stupid
on and on
at this rate well still be here tomorrow
throws the revolver on the table wait a minute
hey i got it
put in more
you understand more
he mimes with his fingers three bullets
you understand three
that way blam
merle hops up and down laughing maniacally
cause i want that bastard
him i want boom
him or me
the guard in charge looks at his companions
they all begin shouting for him to go ahead
the guard in charge purses his lips as if imitating a general coming to a decision and then nods his assent
the guards all howl
merle joins right in
great fucking guy
the guard in charge takes the revolver opens the cylinder and begins sticking in two more cartridges
merle hops up and down again then screams at nick jabbing his finger at him as if in fury
both of us may have to pull on this so get your shit in fuckin shape
to the guards him or me
now we got it him or me
he rubs his hands and sits back down place your bets motherfuckers
now were going
now we got a game
the guard in charge places the revolver on the table spins it
hes going to get it
and then ka pow
the muzzle stops pointing at merle
merle scowls looks over at the guard in charge
the guard in charge has lifted the barrel of his ak and is watching him with caution
the other guards who are totally caught up in the game are yelling and shouting
you guys think im in trouble right
merle picks up the revolver spins the cylinder cocks it
he begins to chant lemme hear it
come on motherfuckers lemme hear it
merle starts it again
the guards who are bett ing on him with guards merle takes a glance at the guard in charge again
the guard in charge is still eyeing him with caution
merle places the revolver to his temple
and clicks into an empty chamber
nothing to it
he pushes the gun across to nick
then he stabs his finger at him screaming again as if in a fit of rage
you got an empty chamber and its in your mind
just put that empty chamber in the gun
nick looks down at the revolver and picks it up
he stares at merle for a moment
then he spins the cylinder cocks the hammer puts it to his head
and clicks into an empty chamber
the guards let out expressions of disbelief
those betting on nick begin taunting those betting on merle
merle sits motionless as if stunned as if utterly defeated his brow furrowed in a mighty frown
nick pushes the revolver across the table
his face is twitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair as if throwing back a challenge
merle stares at the revolver stares at it with an expression of utter gloom
then he reaches out takes the revolver in his hand and pulls it toward him as if he no longer possessed the strength to pick it up
gloom whos for merle
he thumps his fist on the table is anyone for merle
merle roams a glowering eve over the watching guards as if suddenly discovering himself among traitors
slowly he pushes himself to his feet
the gun is still on the table still in his right hand and as he gets up he lets his body sag over it
who here is for merle
there is absolute silence now except for the drumming of the rain
it is as if the war had disappeared vanished
the guards stand motionless hardly breathing so captivated by merles performance that they suddenly resemble little children
is for merle
merle begins his chant again
his voice is low very dramatic and the guard in charge joins right in
with guards merle snaps the revolver level in his hand and blasts the guard in charge hitting him full in the face
at the same time nick throws himself into the guard who is standing behind him spins and slams the guards ak into his chin
two more shots blast out from merles
and we see two guards crash over the kitchen table
nick now opens up with ak and as merle backs off beside him also with an ak they gun the remaining guards to the floor
it is over in an instant
the bodies lie in a bloody tangled mess under a pathetic paper lantern
the rain drones on uninterrupted undiminished eternal
barely visible against the dripping foliage like a shadow is a startled v
the man takes a half step forward unslings his rifle and opens fire
the south vietnamese prisoners are hit where they stand
nick spins badly wounded
merle throws himself on the floor and lets go with the ak
merle appears carrying nick on his back
nick is unconscious and the effort that merle has expended to get him this far can be measured in merles eves which burn like dead coals
as merle approaches traversing the bamboo grove along the side of a steep hill we suddenly see sal stumbling along behind and attached to merle by a short rope
merle comes to a stop unshoulders nick and lays him on the ground
as merle stands looking at nick gasping for breath sal hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboo with an expression of pure terror
where are we going merle
are we going home
there is a sound so faint as to be almost imperceptible
merle throws himself on sal slamming one hand across his mouth and raising the other in case he has to silence nick
for a moment there is nothing silence
the rain drones on and we can hear nicks breath which comes in short shallow rasps
the sound comes again and suddenly a platoon of v
soldiers appear coming down through the trees
their passage is almost completely silent and they go by on both sides moving down the hill
camera closes slowly on merles face
his gums are bleeding and his skin is drawn tight so that every bone stands out in his skull
his teeth are bared his eyes are hollow and he looks within a hairs breadth of being completely mad
a huge battle is taking place nearby
the earth trembles and shakes and gigantic explosions intermittently light the sky
merle staggers down a ravine with nick loses his footing and slides to the bottom where he lies in the mud motionless too tired to move
sal comes down behind
he is hunched over like a gnome
the rope which merle has tied around his neck drags in the mud and his eyes are huge with terror
a whisper right here
sal crouches down in the mud
where are we going merle
are we going home
barely moving his lips right here
another explosion lights the sky this one much closer
in the flash we see that a red american car is stranded in the middle of the road
there is another explosion and another flash
the car is dusty spattered with mud but otherwise it appears miraculously unharmed
nicks breath rattles in his throat
merle who lies beside nick holding him has closed his eyes
sal who is the only one who has seen the car stares at it hard and for a long time trying it out with one eye and then the other
still no answer
sal goes over to merle and shakes him
getting no response he crosses fearfully toward the automobile
when he gets to within a foot of it he reaches out and touches it
merle a car
as the flashes continue to light up the sky sal peers at the tires and begins kicking them
sal crosses to the window and looks in
there is no damage whatsoever the keys are dangling from the ignition
sal pulls open the door and climbs in
he pumps the accelerator hits the starter
merle has dragged sal from the car and thrown him in the ditch below nick
sal is horribly burned and merle kneels over him out of breath tears streaming from his cavernous eyes howling with helpless rage
god damn it
merle looks down at sal
sals face in a mass of raw flesh but his eyes look up at merle with lunatic unwavering trust
more gently sal
goddamn it sal dont you know anything
where are we going merle
are we going home
were going home
refugees are streaming down the road in a desperate frightened human torrent
there is every imaginable means of conveyance from bullock carts to motorbikes but the vast majority carrying their meager belongings are fleeing on foot
the burned out car is still in the middle of the road and the great human tide streams around it as if it were an island
in the distance comes the sound of machine gun fire and mortars are coming in nearby
medvac helicopters clatter overhead with wounded strapped to baskets on the skids
now and then an army convoy comes through blasting the refugees into the ditch
merle sits alone on the embankment by the side of the road
nick and sal are gone and the area is littered with fresh bandage packages and throw away medical supplies
suddenly a jeep pulls up with a two star general in it
wheres your unit soldier
merle stares at the general blankly without comprehension
finally after a long moment he gives a slight shrug
to his driver cmon
well take him along
the general and the driver get out and start up the embankment toward merle
little r and r and youll be standing tall again son
damn this is steep
the general looks up at merle
merle is holding the pearl handled revolver and he cocks the hammer with an audible click
the general and the driver turn tail scramble back down the embankment and pile in the jeep
as they take off yknow theres more fucking maniacs coming out of this conflict
merle watches them go without expression
on the road below the refugees stream past by the hundreds by the thousands by the tens of thousands
for a long moment merle watches then he jams the gun in his pants and stands
merle is walking with the fleeing refugees
camera pans holding on merle as he grows smaller and smaller to a speck in the vast human torrent
the room is tiny a cubicle furnished with a chair
nick is alone standing at the window looking out
he wears ill fitting civilian clothes whose colors are too bright for the pallor of his skin
around his neck is a piece of plastic on which is stapled a colored paper marker
departing aircraft thunder overhead and there is the sound of some nearby hydraulic mechanism
black body bags are laid out in countless rows on the hot concrete two pfcs are stacking them on pallets and more pfcs driving hydraulic lifters are loading the pallets
into the cavernous hold of a huge jet transport
nick turns away from the window and sits down in the chair
suddenly the door bursts open and a harassed doctor comes in
is your name solomon
nick shakes his head
are you sure
lemme see this
the doctor looks at the paper marker on nicks neck
is this yours
this isnt yours
this cant be yours
im going to take this one off and cut it up
he extracts a pair of scissors and does so shred it
so no one gets a hold of it
what im going to do now im going to give you this one
he staples a new marker around nicks neck there
does that feel better
the doctor directs a finger at him
that ones yours
the doctor slams back out the door
another jet thunders overhead
the hydraulic lifters on the loading ramp shriek and whine
nick reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peers down at it from the corner of his eye
it seems to remind him of something and he takes out his wallet
in his wallet is a photograph of linda
nick peers at the photograph intently then closes his wallet and puts it away
banks of telephones line the wall
stretching out from the telephones are long ragged lines of servicemen waiting to call home
the room is huge full of echoes
re enlistment posters are plastered everywhere and canned latin music is playing
nick stands in one of the lines with only one person in front of him
he looks anxious
he takes out his wallet again peers intently at lindas photograph then puts it back
nick takes a half step forward staring at the telephone and then he stops frozen with fear
go on babe
s all yours
mumbles you go ahead
camera holds on nick as he turns out of the line and heads for the exit under a long row of clocks
nick comes along the sidewalk in a crowd of pedestrians
he is drunk and he moves aimlessly as if he had been drifting along for hours
as he comes to a stop staring at a south vietnamese who has lost both legs he fumbles in his pocket for a pint of whiskey empties the bottle and
drops it in the gutter
suddenly across the street something catches his eye
nick throws himself into the traffic headlong without even looking
vehicles swerve and screech to a stop
nick dodges between them gains the sidewalk on the other side and claps his hand on the back of a passing soldier
the soldier turns
it is not sal at all and the resemblance is not even close
thought you were someone else
the soldier continues on his way
the crowd streams on a sea of bobbing brilliant color
nick gropes in his pocket and produces another pint bottle
he unscrews the cap and downs a long swallow
the place is very dark
loud music is playing
partially clad bar girls are dancing with the customers while above on a kind of trapeze naked girls are performing obscene contortions
nick sits at one of the tables
by now he is very drunk and a bar girl is giving him her undivided attention
i love linda see
i love linda more than i can even say
everybody love linda
thats exactly what i mean
i love linda
myself i love linda so much
only good people love linda see
what linda has linda in his ear how you like to have nice fuck with linda

pulls him to his feet linda have special crazy fuck
he looks as if he might be about to cry
i give you special crazy fuck just like linda
linda cry make crazy moan
i give you cry crazy moan
the bar girl comes around the corner with nick guiding him to a flight of narrow stairs
she has one hand around his waist and the other down the front of his pants
you like to call me linda now
you call me linda just like home
suddenly nick draws to a stop staring at a small window at the end of the corridor
he tears himself loose from the bar girl and pushes up against the glass
seated on the sidewalk against the wall of the opposite building is an old man surrounded by a collection of white ceramic elephants
a truck roars by in front of him
motorcycles sputter past and pedestrians hurry in both directions
the old man sits motionless like the guardian of some timeless silent kingdom
nick spins away from the window
look at those elephants
the bar girl stares at him
linda loves elephants
she loves em
nick turns and charges back down the corridor with the bar girl hot on his tail
first i give you special fuck
i gotta get elephants
nick paces up and down in front of the old man and his ceramic elephants
these are great
i wanna tell you these are great elephants
im going home see
stateside in a few days and my wife linda she loves elephants
she has a thing for elephants because elephants
elephants go on

what i mean is my two best buddies are dead see mia who knows and they would have liked some elephants also because
how much are these elephants
i mean lets talk elephant
notices a group of street hey you guys
come over here and carry elephants
the street urchins come running
they are ragged malnourished ranging in age from about six to nine
they are covered with sores
one of them as lost an eye and another has lost a hand
everyone take an elephant
to the youngest urchin you know how to carry an elephant
the urchin nods thats what i thought
right off i figured you as that kind of guy
hey wait a minute i gotta get change

everyone take an elephant and then form up
over here like this in a nice long elephant line
man look at all these elephants
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
surveys them hey but you gotta stand tall to carry elephants
he illustrates better
god damn i mean thats elephants now
now you wait while i get change
nick dives into a nearby bar
the place is as dark as the one before
music blasts from a jukebox and two vaseline covered girls are dancing
as nick crosses to the bar to get change there is a whistling scream and then the front wall of the building disintegrates in a nick pulls himself out of
there is absolute silence in the wrecked bar but rockets are coming in all over the city and the explosions rumble and roar
a nearby building is burning fiercely
the street is deserted except for the sprawled corpses of the street urchins which lie this way and that like broken dolls
nick walks out past the corpses
the street is littered with fragments of broken ceramic gleaming pure white like chunks of snow
the sky is alight with fires
now and then huge explosions rock the night and sirens wail
a lone figure appears walking down the middle of the street
as the figure approaches we see that it is nick
toneless over and over hey hey the wind does blow
hey hey the snow does snow
hey hey the rain does rain
nick swallows as if to force back some overwhelming emotion
then squatting down under a lamp post he begins again
hey hey the wind does blow
hey hey the snow does snow
nick takes out his wallet opens it hurriedly to the photograph of linda and peers at it with a kind of ferocious determination as if this link were the last
as if by staring at it hard he could make it hold
his voice thin cracking hey hey the wind does blow
hey hey the snow does snow there is the sharp report of a pistol shot and then as nick spins staring at a shuttered building there is the unmistakable sound
nick stares at the building for a long moment then he crosses toward it
a tiny light glows inside a paper lantern
lying on the around are three corpses all of them asian all of them expensively dressed and all of them with their heads blown off
as nick stands looking at them a door comes open on the back of the building and two burly men bring out another corpse
the body is that of a young american
like the asians he is expensively dressed and he is dead from a bullet in the right temple
if you are brave and lucky i can make you rich
a man is standing in the shadows of a small grape arbor eyeing him with a look of cold amusement
the mans accent is french
beside him on a small white table is a bottle of champagne and several glasses
you have played
nick stares at the man nods
once you have played it is not so hard
nick shakes his head
you do this for money
a great deal of money
naturally i do not do it myself
i myself do not possess the nerve
smiles but i am always
how do you say
looking out for those who do
it is a thing quite rare
dont say no
when a man says no to champagne he says no to life and that no man must ever do
gives nick a glass where did you play
so few survive
smiles la creme de la creme
how did you obtain release
raises his eyebrows playing
and then you
the man makes a clicking sound three times as if firing a pistol
how extremely clever
that is really most extraordinaire
allow me please to introduce myself
i am armand
and you are
do you know that i have a cousin who is called nicholas and a nephew nickolai
so you are comme on dit en famille
in the family
there is another shot from inside and another round of i have to go
but you must come in
no i but i insist
i have to go
you are frightened no
of what is there to be afraid
the war is no problem
it is a joke a silly thing
i make one call and get you out
armand refills nicks glass
nick looks at it
the glass is as thin as paper and the sparkling bubbles dance and hiss
nick lifts the glass and empties in one swallow
see im going home
smiles to the girl who waits
gives him a look and sits yeah
do you mind if i sit
but of course
please make yourself comfortable
perhaps you would enjoy some fresh caviar or une petite glace or
weary shaking his head no
none of that
unfortunately i must now go in but i leave you my card
naturellement i pay my players cash american
just so you know
armand disappears in the darkness
then his voice comes again
however should you prefer german marks or perhaps swiss francs this of course can be arranged
everything can be arranged
armand moves around the side of the building and the sound of his footsteps fades away
the two burly men come lurching with another corpse
laughter comes from inside the building and there is a glimpse of an elegantly dressed woman seated at a cafe table
the burly men return to the door and shut it tight
in the distance the sky goes up in a huge flash of fire and then the sound of the explosion rolls across the city like a great dead wind
the trailer is all decked out with bunting and stuck like a plum cake with tiny american flags
stretching from the trailer to the side of a house across the street is a huge hand lettered banner which says welcome home nick
and it whips and it snaps in the cold winter wind
nicks battered old shark finned cadillac is in the yard
alongside it are a bunch of newer cars and people are coming from all directions spilling in and out of the trailer and congregating in excited foot stomping half frozen
we see the old priest on his way from the church
we see the older women wrapped in shawls and carrying cakes and cookies trudging up the hill
we see albert john and a bunch of steelworkers all of them half bombed dragging two cases of beer on a childs sled
we see linda peering out the trailer window pale and anxious looking
we see vince who is unofficial lookout jumping up and down at the approach of every car and screaming this is it
this is nick
and then when it isnt saying not yet
just hold your water ill tell you when
and we see an empty street into which six vets from the vfw post come tottering
the vets are all in their old uniforms
while three of them attempt to make music on a bass drum a fife and an old army bugle the other three attempt to sing
three cheers for the red white and blue
this is hard
christ almighty its fifty years
three cheers for the red white and blue
nick sits hunched forward in the back seat surrounded by unwrapped cartons containing electric appliances he has bought for linda
nick looks nervous very nervous
suddenly as the cab comes over the crest of a hill the trailer looms into sight straight ahead with vince hopping up and down in the snow and the old
vets all marking time under the flapping banner
will you lookit
nick stares at the approaching trailer
thats not it
whatre you crazy
thats not it
you said a trailer
you said thats not it
hey now listen
now you said im telling you thats not it
now keep going
nick throws himself down on the floor
just keep going
just keep going straight
linda is outside standing with vince and albert
this is him
im telling you this is nick
the taxicab comes thudding by
linda vince and albert all watch as it disappears over a rise
to vince i thought that was it
so hes in the next one albert
i mean take it easy
i mean youre driving everybody nuts
singing raggedly three cheers for the red white and blue
to linda you okay
linda gives a thin smile
its gonna be the next one
its gotta be the next one
i mean its gotta be
a huge neon sign stands against the grey sky buzzing angrily as if it were full of bees
the taxi driver comes out of one of the units gets back in his cab and pulls away
nick stands in the doorway where the driver has left him
his duffle bag and the cartons of electric appliances are piled along the wall by his feet
his head is thrown back and he is draining a bottle of whiskey gulping it down in great raw swallows
nick lowers the bottle catches his breath and goes at it again
this time as he lowers the bottle the stark panic is gone but there is still fear blind nameless fear like that of an animal run to the ground
nick crosses to the window grips the frame with both hands and looks out
the five great stacks trail ribbons of black smoke across the pale winter sky steam billows upward in huge silver edged clouds and there is the flash and gleam of
nick turns back to the room
he stares at it blankly stares at the bed stares at the bureau stares at the chair then he picks up the bottle closes his eyes and begins gulping down
whiskey gulping it hard fast as hard and fast as he can
the banner stretching to the house across the street has been whipped to shreds by the wind
in the yard parked beside nicks black cadillac is another car of about the same vintage
there is a case of beer on its roof the windows are entirely frosted over and the engine is running
after a moment two steelworkers come down the street and knock on the trailer door
two older women emerge putting on their coats and then linda comes to the door and tells the steelworkers she has no news
the steelworkers and the older women start off but now one of the women points to the frosted up car
the steelworkers go back pound on the roof of the frosted up car pull open a few doors and go on their way
first thing out is a girl
next thing out is a second girl
their dresses are rumpled and half undone
neither one has a coat and the second girl is missing a shoe
the girls both plunge back inside the car where howling and cursing can now be heard
the girls both retrieve their coats
the second girl gets her missing shoe plus a bra and a pair of panties
she returns the panties to the first girl puts on her shoe and they both take off at a fast trot
as the two girls leave there is a cascade of empty beer cans and albert vince and john all stagger out bleary eyed hung over half undressed and freezing
linda comes out of the trailer with coffee but just as she emerges the whistle at the mill goes off
albert and vince begin yelling at each other yelling at john and yelling at linda
then they throw themselves back in the car and start off
the case of beer on the roof crashes to the street
they stop pile out pick up the cans heave them in the back seat and take off again
john says something to linda and goes on his way
linda stands in the yard alone with the three cups of coffee
nick stands half way down a rickety wooden stairway watching
linda turns and goes back inside the trailer
nick swallows and starts down the stairway toward the trailer
he hesitates pulls the bottle from his pocket drains the last of it and tucks it under the stairs
straightening up he claws at his hair trying to comb it with his fingers
then he starts down again
cakes cookies six packs of beer and bottles of wine cover almost every inch of available space
linda sits on the little settee wedged between two cases of coca cola and hunched over a white sweater which she is attempting with painful slowness to knit
linda is trying not to cry
she is trying her god damnedest
there is a knock at the door
then trying to be totally matter of fact she puts down the sweater crosses to the door and opens it
linda stares at him
nick gives a little laugh and steps in
throws herself in his arms nick
oh nick youre back
she hugs him for a moment as hard as she can then they pull apart
oh nick i thought you were hurt some accident
maybe you fell or maybe some car
back in his arms i thought someone stole you away
oh i missed you so
they pull apart
how are you
how are you
i just go along you know
down at the market
i mean it just seems theres a million things to do
are you sure youre all right
i mean what about the wound
anger that was nothing
that wasnt anything
but it was just the complications
i mean you take a little thing over there and then you get complications
i mean all the guys had it
i made you a sweater
she gets it here
you have to take that off
nick removes his coat
linda pulls the sweater over him i couldnt remember your exact size
the sweater is huge a great rumpled thing reaching almost to nicks knees
smoothly oh thats fine
it is a little too big
she pulls the sweater back off but i can easily fix that
one thing about wool sweaters they are such a cinch to fix
she crosses to a garbage pail out of nicks line of sight and stuffs the sweater in it
hows the trailer
once or twice it did fall off the blocks
i dont know what thats from
is that what it is
i couldnt figure out
did you get hurt
you didnt get hurt
it just kind of goes thump
would you like a coke

what about champagne
lets have champagne
i dont think we have champagne
lets have this
ill get you an opener
oh thats right
lets just have beer
do you want some cheese
or maybe eggs
maybe we should have coffee
she begins to sob
camera closes on her face nick
im so glad youre alive
im so happy
i just dont know what to do
nick and linda are some distance away
nick is shaking hands with an enthusiastic man while linda stands to one side watching his face and so full of love that she seems about to burst
another man comes over
linda takes the mans arm and presents him to nick
nick and linda sit opposite one another
across the street a coal train is rumbling slowly by and nick is watching it
the cars are black interchangable and they roll on and on
suddenly the last car appears
the car passes and there is silence
linda gives nick a smile
it was all for nothing
do you know that
it was all for nothing
linda stares at him
she doesnt know what to say how to respond
nick forces a grin gestures with his hand and shrugs
he picks up the check stands
i just want to say how sorry i am about sal and about merle
i know you loved them and i know its not the same
i mean now
i dont know if you want to talk naw its
this guy wants his money
the place is full of crates and boxes
one crew is unloading a tractor trailer
another crew is stacking and unpacking
nick stands with linda and a red faced cigar chewing manager who is pumping nicks hand slapping him on the back and shouting orders all at the same time
you did a good job kid

linda hurries off
the manager comes in from behind clapping nick on the shoulder and going for his ear thats one sweet little piece of ass
im telling you thats one sweet little piece of ass
whos got these pears god damn it
whos got the count on these goddamn pears
nick stands by the entrance to the mill
it is cold and he looks as if he had been waiting for some time
suddenly steelworkers begin streaming out the doors heading for their cars
nick cranes his neck and then he catches sight of albert and vince
he grabs vince and pulls him through the departing steelworkers
sees him jesus nick
vince grabs nicks hand shakes it
then albert does the same
where the hell were you

nick comes through the crowd of steelworkers shaking hands
the steelworkers treat him with immense respect

they squeeze his shoulder pat his back reaching out for him touching him
good going nick

a tray arrives loaded with beer and shots of whiskey

and here he is
nick sits at the bar flanked by vince and albert
both vince and albert are completely glassed out
behind in the booths three or four steelworkers are sleeping
john moves around behind the counter wiping things off
he nods we didnt have to do it john
hows she taking it

with a dull beery blink fucking a
worse since she talked to who

john albert and vince exchange glances nod

tears begin streaming down his face nick
nick we dont know where sal is
nick angela wont tell us
what do you mean
nick she wont say why
but sals mother
what about sals mother
shes out of her tree nick
she is straight out of her tree
stares at them oh jesus
he walks in a circle and then stops staring at them
nick turns and goes out
the room is very dark
angela sits at a lace covered table by the window where a street lamp illuminates her in an eerie glow
angela holds a portable radio in tier hand a very tiny one and she fiddles with the dial going from one station to another
there is a sound from the hallway then sals mother comes in with nick
i know i know you
such a familiar face
oh i know now
the toaster man
ill go and get it for you
sals mother goes out
angela lights up a cigarette
im very glad
angela i just heard sal was alive
where is he
nick hes fine
hes in a hospital and theyre fixing him up
you talk to him
twice a day
what hospital is he in
sal is very weak
he suffered a severe wound
and right now he doesnt want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing
hey angela sal and i go back a long way
he doesnt want people bugging him nick
angela begins to tremble jabs out her cigarette and stands up
she stares at nick for a moment goes to a telephone pad and writes down a number in a tiny nearly illegible scrawl
nick comes up behind her
angela finishes puts down the pen and stands with her back against the wall
nick tears off the piece of paper looks at it puts it in his pocket
angela laughs and gives a strange twisted smile avoiding nicks eyes
did you ever think life would turn out like this
you know what sals got now
one arm nick and
the door to the kitchen bangs open and sals mother comes in with an electric toaster and a screwdriver
this is it
what you do you stick this in here
pushes the toaster in nicks arms
then you jab it see
jab it good
somethings in it
somethings in it
nick sits on the steps with the toaster that sals mother gave him in his lap
it is snowing and from inside the church we hear the choir singing
the sound is massive deep and dark like a great river rolling through the night
camera closes on nick
he is staring at something tears glistening in his eyes
we see a lone telephone booth at the curb
the door is half open and snow is blowing in
nick closes his eyes leans his head forward and takes it in his hands
linda steps out of the shower and begins to dry herself
it just seems sort of strange coming to a motel
like a honeymoon
or some kind of parlez vous
not parlez vous
she giggles what am i saying
thats those cocktails
what i mean is rendezvous
some kind of rendezvous
linda pulls on a short and very sexy nightie then looks at herself in the mirror
she is very excited very nervous
she strikes a pose pulling up the bottom of the nightie and poking a finger in her mouth
do you know what i mean
nick doesnt answer
linda pulls the door full open takes one last look at herself and goes out
as linda comes out of the bathroom her face falls and she stops dead in her tracks
nick is lying on the bed sprawled on his back one shoe off and sound asleep
nick doesnt stir doesnt budge
linda crosses and looks at him hungrily top to bottom then she gives his toe a wistful shake
nick its me
but nick is out gone
linda lets out a little moan and sits down on the chair beside the bed
then almost immediately she stands and begins taking off his clothes
she takes off his shoes then both socks
as she goes to undo his belt his shirt which is unbuttoned falls slightly open revealing a fresh scar
linda stares at the scar for a moment then she slowly exposes the whole of nicks chest
nick stands at the handle of a long metal rod
at the other end of the rod albert and vince are attaching metallic strips
when albert and vince have secured the strips they signal to nick and all three of them lower their goggles
camera pulls slowly back
nick is standing below a furnace which is seven stories high towering above him into a maze of cat walks and monstrous steel hipped cranes
albert and vince give a signal and the crane operator raises the door at the bottom of the furnace
nick is now alone standing like don quixote with his lance
as nick advances toward the base of the furnace with his rod the surface of his asbestos suit begins to smoke and bits of lint which have stuck to it
burst into flame
within reach of the furnace now nick pauses
then lifting the metal rod he jams it through the open doorway at the base of the furnace
there is a white flash as the metallic strips explode and then a geyser of molten steel erupts in a huge jet through the doorway passing nick at the level
of his shoulders and showering him in a great cascade of white sparks
nick sits at the bar silent hunched over a beer lost in thought
all around him steelworkers are shouting yelling cracking jokes
after a moment vince pushes in claps him on the back
hows it feel huh
hows it feel to be back
forced enthusiasm great
i mean i guess you still think about nam
i mean naw
shakes his head uh huh
hey nick you ever do it with one of those slants
looks around youre kiddin
you have to understand doing it with one
theyre small see so if youre smart you get about six or eight
i mean if you want to have any fun
six or eight
nods and they go wild
lowers his voice they have these little sticks vince
they call them chomp chomps and when you get these girls going you have to stick em in their mouths
vince stares at nick
his respiration is up his mouth is bone dry and his eyes are as big as saucers
for a moment his belief is total then a frown crosses his face
youre full of shit
pounding him on the head and i believed you
i oughta punch you out
hey lets go huntin
lets go huntin
what do you say
what do you say
he spots john passing with a tray of beer
albert scoops john into his arms where he holds him from behind
into his ear john were going huntin
were all going
nick vince albert and john
what are you crazy
take these beers
they all take a beer
john raises his glass solemnly
heres to huntin
hopping up and down just like always
just like it always was
am i right
in the timeless words of squire albert
vince cracks up howling
vince collapses on the floor
in the timeless words of squire albert
in a ragged chorus hey
nick sits on the bed in the back part of the trailer
his hunting gear is piled on the floor the lights are out and he is staring at the telephone which is illuminated through the window by a street light on
there is a sound outside then the lights come on as linda enters with groceries
linda crosses to the doorway
what are you doing
youre going hunting
i see youre going hunting
nick looks at the equipment on the floor
all the guys were all going huntin
like we did
like we always used to
i think you should
nick gets to his feet suddenly
his face is twisted with pain and his voice is cracked with emotion
you know how sometimes youre going along
youre going along
and thats all
one thing is right after another like steps
and you step along
nick can hardly breathe
it is as if he were choking
i dont know where that is
a car pulls up outside
the horn begins blowing then vince and albert begin pounding on the wall of the trailer
time to roll
i gotta go
nick swings his pack on his back picks up his rifle and heads for the door
linda follows still clutching her groceries her emotions so pulverized she cant even speak
i dont know
couple of days
snow is blowing swirling past the trunks of stark ice covered trees
there is no horizon
sky and earth are bound in a moan of wind in the faint creak of frozen limbs and the whispering fitful spinning flakes
nick appears suddenly as a gust of wind shifts the slanting snow
nick is moving easily heading slightly uphill following the contour of the slope
as he draws closer we see that he is following a set of fresh tracks
a magnificent seven point buck stands by a grove of hemlocks looking down the slope
nick appears below barely visible in the swirling snow
the buck watches nick for a moment then turns unhurriedly and vanishes into the trees
vince is out of breath clawing his way up a steep slope on all fours
john and albert who have reached a level area above vince unsling their rifles
shots are going off in every direction and the sound is so magnified by echoes that it sounds like a full scale war
what are you kiddin
are you kiddin me albert
twenty times i coulda had her
one time she begged me practically begged me
listen i had her tit which was out in one hand and my other hand
you know that mole on the inside of her right leg
well i was past that mole way past that mole and i was john nudges albert
four deer are coming down the slope single file
john and albert raise their rifles and fire
two of the deer fall and the remaining take off
vince who is just getting to his feet unslings his rifle trips and falls down
john and albert drag vince to his feet and then rush over to the two dead deer
coming after them nice shootin you guys
not half bad
leans his rifle on the horns of one of the fallen deer
course how could you miss right
twenty maybe thirty feet
i mean if ida been where you guys were psst
john signals with his head
another deer has come out of the woods
the deer is rattled by the gunfire and peers at vince uncertainly
vince spins and grabs his gun which immediately goes off
he slams another shell in the chamber and scrambles to his feet but the rifle sling is hooked on the antlers of the dead deer and another shot ricochets off
a nearby rock
john and albert dive for cover
as they look up they see the deer trot down the slope and then vince firing wildly running after it
the wind is much stronger moaning in the trees
nick appears moving fast at a near trot
suddenly he stops listening
at the same moment there is a snort
the buck is behind him bounding away
the buck appears trotting out of the swirling snow
reaching a deadfall the buck pauses looking back and then turns sharp left and disappears
nick comes out of the snow
he is winded but still going hard
nick reaches the deadfall hesitates then rapidly springs over
as he touches down on the other side there is a growling sound
nick grabs for the deadfall
the wind shifts and we see that he has stepped onto a boulder which is loosely planted at the top of a steep scree slope
as nick watches the boulder begins to roll then to bound dislodging other rocks and boulders all of them bouncing and leaping and cracking
and then falling soundless over a sheer ledge to unknown depths below
albert and john have dragged their two dead deer to a log beside the shack
they sit side by side drenched in sweat guzzling beer out of both hands
oh that is sweet
just like a hot shit
john lowers his beer
albert gives him a blank expression then cracks up
shots explode nearby
at first the shots are scattered but they quickly open into a full barrage
albert and john stand up
the deer that vince was chasing earlier comes hobbling out of the woods pursued by a group of half drunk hunters
vince comes barreling through the hunters shouting and screaming
vinces clothes are in tatters the sole is gone from one shoe and the barrel of his rifle is jammed up with mud and perceptibly bent
i got this one
this ones mine
vince loses his footing and rolls down the embankment head over heels
vince comes up ten feet from the bewildered deer
he raises his rifle fires and the barrel splits open
shots begin coming in thudding in the mud and ricocheting off rocks
the deer wheels out on the highway
vince heaves his rifle at the deer draws his pistol
cars are parked on both sides of the road
hunters are sitting in the cars drinking eating sandwiches and warming themselves at small fires
more hunters are up on the embankment
i got this one
this ones mine
the panicked deer bolts down the highway between the parked cars
the hunters on the embankment open fire
the hunters in the cars dive for cover
hold your fire
i got this one
vince fires fires again
shots are ringing everywhere
hunters are shouting running yelling
a car window goes out a headlight goes out
the deer is hit falls and gets up
vince takes aim
a fleeing hunter bowls him over
the deer bolts for the woods bullets smashing all around it
vince scrambles to his feet and plunges after it
i got it
i got this one
the deer staggers through the trees blood pouring from its wounds
vince comes stumbling after it
he fires fires albert and john stand with their beers looking into the woods
a shot zings by close and they dive behind a log
the deer comes out of the woods barely able to keep moving
vince appears reeling
he takes aim at the deer and there is a dull click
vince jams his pistol back in his holster
albert indicates his rifle
vince stumbles over to it rams a cartridge in the chamber
looks around bewildered wheres it gone
vince staggers to the cabin door
the deer is lying on the floor motionless dead
i got it
hey you guys i got it
the wind is blowing in gusts slanting the snow first one way and then the other
nick appears in the distance a black speck in the endless expanse of shifting white
as nick draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion
his clothes are caked with snow his breath comes in a shallow gasp and his gait is uneven favoring one leg
as nick approaches camera he falters and limps to a stop
there are no tracks
there is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in the driving snow
the wind bangs in from one way then it shifts and bangs in again from another way
suddenly it stops entirely
in the silence there is a sound the click of a hoof on rock
the buck is standing on the shoreline not thirty feet away looking down at him
nick pushes himself to his feet raises his rifle and sights down the barrel
nick sits on his haunches with his back against a sheer rock face
as he devours a hostess twinkie he looks out over a snow shrouded landscape of such spectacular beauty that it might be something from a dream
the coleman lantern hangs from the rafter rocking in the wind
nick is propped against the wall dozing
john is out cold
albert and vince are both drunk and arguing bitterly
youre full of shit vince
youre so full of shit youre going to float away
youre a crock
youre a walking talking crock
i mean what do you know

she might do it albert but you cant fuckin tell me that she does
she does vince
thats what im telling you
vince is sheet white trembling
he grabs up the pistol and cocks it
shrieking say that one more time
go on say it
nick is half way up the wall still half asleep staring at the pistol in disbelief
suddenly he springs seizes the gun with one hand and slams vince to the floor
vince gets up
nick slugs him in the face knees him in the stomach and begins pounding his head against the wall
albert lurches over pulls nick away
nick youll kill him
vince goes back a long way
vince gets to his feet
blood is streaming down his face
what the hell was that
picks up the pistol what did you think
did you think it was loaded
you loaded it vince
i saw you
the fuck i did
the fuck you didnt
nick takes the pistol
what do you think
you think i dont know
nick looks at him then he empties the pistol into the floor
for a moment there is absolute silence
the wind moans in the trees snow curls through the open door and john who is still soundly sleeping finds a new note on which to snore
nick looks down at the pistol turns it over in his hands
im going to throw this fuckin thing away
nick goes out
for a moment nick stands in the light from the door listening to the wind
he looks down at the pistol again then he heaves it into the trees
the wind gusts
the snow swirls and hisses slipping through the woods in great streaming wraiths
nick watches it for a moment then he turns and goes back in
the trailer is lonely looking dark and cold
vince pulls into the yard beside nicks car and skips to a stop
nick gets out says a few words to vince and everyone laughs
nick goes around to the trunk removes his gear slams the lid and pounds on the car
vince takes off thudding over the curb with his load of three dead deer
nick crosses to the trailer and goes inside
two dozen amputees in wheelchairs are watching a western
in the foreground a nurse holds a telephone
beyond the nurse we see a wizzened figure in a wheelchair coming slowly down the polished corridor
as the figure draws closer we realize it is sal
sal is dressed in a white hospital gown the bottom of which hangs over the front of the wheelchair and trails limply on the floor
both sals legs have been amputated and he has lost one arm
his face is terribly scarred and what expression he displays is centered in his eyes
sal takes the telephone
the soundtrack from the movie in the hello
nick sits in a little chair by the window still in his hunting clothes huddled anxiously over the receiver
sal its me nick
hows it with you
same old stuff
he can hardly hear whats that noise
whats that noise

the pencil holders neat i mean wait a minute
john waynes making so much noise i can hardly i gotta get back nick
sal looks around in desperation
theyre passing out popcorn now so ill be talking to you
maybe next year
nick holds the receiver staring into it
there is the sound sal
sal is wheeling himself rapidly down the polished corridor
at the doorway to the recreation room he pauses looking back at the dangling receiver
then he turns and disappears into the flickering darkness where bugles are sounding a cavalry charge
nick listens to the sound of the bugles for a moment then puts the receiver back on the telephone
he stands walks around in a little circle pained terribly upset
his eye falls on the clock
it is nearly eight oclock
he turns hurries out the door
the lot is empty except for scores of abandoned shopping carts which a clerk is banging together
nick gets out of his car and goes in
two or three checkers are closing out the registers up front
shes in back
how was huntin
nick goes down a long aisle of bright packages
coming out at the back he finds linda sitting in a green plastic chair crying
honey whats wrong
helpless shrug i dont know
there must be something
linda looks at him tears streaming down her face
im just so lonely
ive got the car
shakes her head ill be out
just leave me
ill be out
nick walks back down the aisle between the bright packages
the clerk is still collecting abandoned shopping carts
the carts crash and clank as the clerk rams them together
nick sits behind the wheel watching the clerk
his hands begin shaking uncontrollably and he gets back out of the car
nick watches the lights go out in the market
linda comes out of the door and crosses towards him
nick fumbles for the door
lets make love nick
linda takes him in her arms and holds him tight
lets make love forever
linda is asleep lying on her back arms flung out across the pillows like a dancer leaping
nick stands beside the bed wrapped in a blanket looking down at her
after a moment he draws the covers over her fusses with her slippers until they are straight and then goes to the window
the wind is blowing
bits of trash skitter and swirl in the frozen ruts and a cat comes by meowing
suddenly a man appears walking slowly down the street
the man is elegantly dressed in western attire wearing a tailored suit with vest polished boots and a stetson hat
as the man draws under the light of a street lamp he pauses looking at nicks trailer
nick backs away from the window
for a moment he stands motionless hardly able to believe his eyes
he looks over at linda he looks down at a chair then he pushes his face to the window again
the street is empty
the man is gone
nick hesitates then he sheds the blanket and pulls on pants shirt jacket and jams his sockless feet into a pair of slices
nick comes out into the street
there is no one in sight
nick crosses to the intersection of columbine
a beer can rolling in the wind
nick jams himself against a wall zippers his jacket
he is irked with himself a little frightened
suddenly he hears a car door close and en engine start up
a black limousine pulls out of a nearby street and comes past him slowly
a chauffeur is at the wheel
the passenger in back appears to be the man he saw but the man is looking out the window on the other side and his face is not visible
as nick watches the limousine rapidly gathers speed
the tail lights grow small then the car dips over a hill and disappears
sunlight streams through a window
the television is going
in a far corner sal sits in his wheelchair sleeping
camera closes slowly on sal
his head has fallen to one side and his single arm sticks into the air as if he had failed in his grasp of something as if he were drowning
on a tray in front of him is an untouched breakfast of orange juice milk and a little box of wheaties
someone is descending the stairs
after a moment the feet appear clad in expensive cowboy boots
we see expensive tailor made trousers a belt buckle embossed with a six shooter
and then suddenly merles face
merle slows in his descent stops looking at something
nick is getting out of a cab
he pays the driver and starts toward the building
merle watches nick for a moment his face utterly without expression then merle continues down the stairs
nick is pushing sal down a walkway
sal we need you
we need you
how can you need me
we do sal
youre the heart
turns sal and sits on a bench
sal youre gonna die
youre gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and youre gonna die
im not saying its gonna be the same
its not gonna be the same but whatever its gonna be were all gonna do it sal
god damn it we are
we are gonna do it
im so scared
im so fuckin scared to go home
nods i know
its like coming from the moon
did you go hunting
did you get one
you didnt get a deer
i tracked this one a big buck
god he was such a beauty
whats this suitcase here
nick pulls a suitcase off the rack behind sals chair
i dont know
nick sets the suitcase on a low wall and starts to undo the clasps
maybe angela brought you stuff
i know she said the suitcase slips over the back of the wall
nick swings up on the wall and then he freezes
the lid of the suitcase has popped open and bundles of money are scattered all down the slope of a steep embankment
mom keeps sending me socks nick
i mean if its socks or something just let em go
nick looks down at the money scattered at his feet
the bundles are made up of hundreds and they are everywhere
maybe you could use socks nick
jesus i mean come to think of it socks are pretty expensive now
its not socks sal
nick bends over the suitcase and begins going through looking for identification
there is nothing
as he straightens up he notices a wadded up piece of paper lying beside one of the bundles of bills
the paper is about an inch square
the corners are tattered and it looks as if it had been carried in someones pocket for a long time
nick picks the paper up realizes it is a calling card and unfolds it
nick leans on a railing watching the black interchangeable cars of a coal train roll slowly by
sal sits with the suitcase of money in his lap utterly bewildered crying
who is it nick
who is it
i dont understand
nick looks at sal
his head is spinning and he brings himself back with effort
its merle sal
nick nods how do you know
i saw him last night
i thought i was dreaming
i thought i was out of my mind
merle gave me this
hey i mean where would a guy like merle get money like this
nick is standing slightly behind sal looking down at the money
the reality of what merle is doing has nearly overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he maintains a casual tone
oh cards maybe
its getting cold sal
im going to take you in
starts off well call angela
the guys can help her bring you home
did i tell you i was going on a trip
what do you mean nick
you said youd be its okay
hey its okay
just a week
just to see phantom mary
didnt i ever tell you about phantom mary
starts off again well
phantom marys on my mothers side
naturally no one there admits it because phantom marys pretty weird
you want to hear the whole story
like i say phantom marys pretty weird
lives alone lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called pajamas and a cow called fred
well last week i got a call from phantom mary which in itself was very strange
the place is a madhouse of activity
as jets scream overhead troops embarking for saigon are being counted and recounted
sergeants are yelling off names
clerks are typing forms and papers
forklift trucks weave in and out drivers cursing
nick is back in uniform
he stands at a window watching a jet transport being prepared for loading
a clerk comes by arguing with a sergeant
the clerk sets down his clipboard to consult the sergeants papers
nick picks up the clipboard and moves into the crowd
nick spots a lone second lieutenant sitting on his gear
more officers are waiting nearby but the second lieutenant seems not to know them
nick moves in close enough to read the second lieutenants name tag
i got you on this flight biederman
is that right
follow me please
nick walks along briskly with the lieutenant at his side
right this way
nick comes to a door opens it
the lieutenant walks into the closet and comes to a stop looking puzzled
nick comes in behind him closes the door and picks up a length of pipe
take off the uniform
the lieutenant stares at nick dumbfounded
take off the uniform lieutenant
the lieutenant nods begins taking off his uniform
nick has changed into the lieutenants uniform and tied him to a chair
the lieutenant is in tears
nick is going through his orders
please mister please
this is vital i go to saigon
this is very important
exasperated listen biederman im going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important
that i must not tell you
you see there
stiffly i will not betray my country
nick throws down the pipe in disgust whips a gag around the lieutenants mouth and ties it
when i get to saigon ill tell em where you are
slams the door
viet cong sappers have just attacked
a number of jet fighters are burning bodies are strewn over the tarmac and jeeps with soldiers are racing back and forth
out beyond the jet transport taxis into view lumbering like a great silver monster out of the night
nick stands in the aisle next to a colonel who is peering out the window
jesus christ they hit the airport
those fuckin niggers
this time im going to eat balls
you ever try em
leans close not bad fresh but they dont keep worth a pigs fart
everyone starts out
lotta guys dont know that
a siren is screaming in the distance
nick looks around nervously
the colonel is still right in beside him
tell you something else
dont eat em in the damn delta
unless you like em fishy
i never did
the scream of the siren grows louder
suddenly a jeep careens around the corner followed by a huge black cadillac flying american flags on the fenders
both vehicles screech to a stop and an mp jumps out of the jeep with a loud hailer
amplified lieutenant biederman
lieutenant biederman report to the ramp
grabs nicks arm and waves right here sergeant
hes right here
right this way lieutenant
nick is hurried to the limousine where a second mp holds the door
quick as you can sir
were in a rush
nick gets in the limousine
the second mp slams the door jumps in the front and they take off with sirens wailing
there are jeeps with mps ahead there are jeeps with mps behind
seated beside nick is a gigantic marine corporal who stares rigidly ahead
pedestrians and bicyclists flee as the cavalcade comes screaming down a wide boulevard
the jeeps peel off to the side
the gate swings open and the limousine enters the compound
a string quartet is playing
guests in evening clothes are drinking champagne
nick enters with the marine corporal and is whisked rapidly down a hallway
nick stands in front of a huge range staring down at a table
on the table there is a basket of eggs an omelette pan and a pile of mushrooms
across from the table six servants with napkins on their arms stand waiting with plates
the marine corporal is holding a chefs hat
nick takes off his cap puts on the chefs hat
suddenly a door comes open and the american ambassador and his wife come in
so good to see you
how are you
how are you
darling this is henri
henri my wife elizabeth
henri we are starved
six omelettes sil vous plait
hissing avec champignons
back to his wife fines herbes
the wife shakes her head
the ambassador winks
the ambassador and his wife hurry out
there is dead silence
nick pulls the marine corporal to one side points to his crotch
nick comes down the corridor behind the marine corporal
as he passes a straight back chair standing against the wall he picks it up and swings it down on the marine corporals head
the blow is ferocious
the chair splinters into pieces and the marine corporal goes down with a dull thud
nick stands for a moment looking at him
then he kneels removes his pistol and jams it in his belt
three marine guards are standing at parade rest by an open iron gate
as nick appears in his white chefs hat the guards snap to attention and he walks into the crowd of asians streaming by outside
nick takes out his wallet extracts the tattered calling card that he found with sals money and dials the number
he lets it ring a long time but there is no answer
nick is not sure where he is
suddenly he stops recognizing the yard with the little grape arbor where he met armand
the yard is grown over
as nick goes in there comes a low buzz of flies
he trips over something draws back
seeing a candle on the little table under the grape arbor he crosses and lights it
the yard is full of discarded champagne bottles red velvet cushions and rotting corpses
nick leans over one of the corpses
the skin is falling away and the eye sockets writhe with maggots
nick straightens looks around
the back door to the building is open
nick draws his pistol and goes in
nick finds his way blocked by a door
he steps back hurls himself against it
the door gives way with a crash and he staggers into the middle of a small stage hung with red velvet curtains and furnished with a table and two chairs
out beyond the proscenium huddled together in a litter of broken cafe tables a family of refugees stare at him in terror from the other side of a small fire
waves pistol its okay
the refugees cower back even further
screaming its okay god damn it
its all right
pounding and banging come from the direction of the front door
nick readies his pistol cautiously unbolts the door and jerks it open
the colonel from the airplane tumbles in and falls flat on his back
standing in the doorway lit by the headlights of two cars is a party of u
officers arvn officers and whores
no attempt to get up hey good buddy how you doin
gestures this is biederman you guys
biederman this is son loc tu fon huckerbelly and potts

he fishes a piece of paper out of his breast pocket
here it is

chez armand has gone to other spot

the colonel opens a brown paper bag he is carrying and presents her with a large red white and blue dildo
this is for bein so smart
the whore shrieks with pleasure
arm around whore lets go
the colonel throws an arm around nick and they all start for the cars
to nick boy do i love this conflict
what the hell were you doin in there
you know a guy named merle
thats who were looking for
i got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more
he retired you know

pulls nick close so he can whisper in his ear
he eats em
he eats em raw
an elegant house of french design is ablaze with lights
the house is encircled by a stone terrace on which tables have been set up
over the terrace and strung out for a hundred yards into the surrounding trees are countless paper lanterns which bob and sway in the wind
guests are everywhere wandering in and out of the house sitting at the tables and strolling under the trees
for the most part the guests are americans and south vietnamese
the majority of these are officers in uniform but there are numerous civilians mixed among them and the civilians are attired in everything from sports shirts to white linen suits
as to nationality there are no limits
there are french germans belgians swiss chinese british and australians
whores and mistresses abound
wives are not greatly in evidence except to dog the heels of heavily armed arvn guards who wander about glass eyed drinking champagne
jeeps personnel carriers trucks and light tanks are parked side by side with gleaming mercedes limousines staff cars from various government agencies and a blitz of civilian vehicles running from
sedans to motor scooters
more vehicles arrive by the minute and exotic couples like plumed birds debark in the swirling dust
a dozen arvn helicopters have put down between the trees
one has crashed and lies on its side with a broken rotor
there is a mounting clatter in the distance and another helicopter comes out of the sky
as it sets down a dashingly handsome air force officer hops out and extends a hand to his wife
when his wife has descended the officer opens a back compartment in the fusilage and carefully takes out their baby
he hands the baby to his wife and they stroll off toward the house
gambling tables are set up in all the rooms
the betting is heavy champagne flows like water and the atmosphere is one of reckless abandon as if money like love were good for an hour
low bleachers covered in red velvet are set in a semi circle facing a small stage
the stage is lit with a single blindingly bright spotlight and is furnished with a table and two velvet covered chairs
two contestants both of them vietnamese sit opposite one another
between them lying on the table is a revolver
both contestants are dressed in tuxedos
both wear red numbers on their downstage arm
although the bleachers are not yet full eager bettors jam the first three rows
here clerks with change trays take the bets signalling each transaction to a marker who chalks the shifting odds on a large board
camera closes on nick standing in the aisle staring in disbelief at the evolution of the game he once played
now a referee enters the stage carrying two strips of scarlet cloth
amplified game number seven
gentlemen will please wrap
the contestants wrap their heads with the scarlet cloth
as he loads revolver one cartridge
game to be played to completion
forfeit automatic after delay of one minute
the referee places the pistol back in the center of the table and spins a wheel whose intervals are alternately marked l and r
the wheel clatters to a stop with the marker on l
gentleman on the left will now commence play
the referee steps out of the light
a gong sounds
the contestant on the left picks up the pistol spins the cylinder cocks it and places it to his temple
he hesitates pulls the trigger
and clicks out
nick is unable to bear it
he turns starts around toward the back of the stage
as nick moves through the guests we hear nick turns
the second contestant has the pistol to his temple
he pulls the trigger
the gun goes off with a deafening roar and he topples on the floor
the first contestant steps forward as the spotlight narrows nick stares at the first contestant celebrating his victory
he looks around him
bettors are screaming and yelling in five languages
nick starts off again hurrying
nick comes upon a pile of six naked corpses with their heads blown off
opposite the corpses sitting standing pacing squatting in the dirt are a group of waiting contestants
some of these are american
most are south vietnamese several of whom have come with wives and families
a few of the contestants are well dressed most are in rags
of suddenly a woman with a baby lets out a shriek
two burly men appear bringing the corpse of the second contestant
as the woman with the baby begins sobbing and screaming with grief the burly men strip the tuxedo off the second contestant and then as each article is summarily removed
they begin dressing one of the waiting contestants in it
if you are brave and lucky i can make you rich
nick turns and finds armand behind him
armand studies him for a fraction of a second and then smiles
cest tres amusant
you have been promoted
and to a jew
i am joking of course
seriously nick may i hope that you have come to play
i came to see merle
and you know merle
studies him you are his friend
where is he
faint smile merle is under his tree
beside the terrace
you cant miss him
guests are still coming in from the cars strolling down through the trees in bright coveys and flocks chattering like birds
laughter comes from the terrace
glass tinkles and the tiny lanterns bob and sway
nick appears hurrying down the steps
suddenly he stops
merle is sitting at a table under a nearby tree
he is alone dressed in a tuxedo watching the arriving guests with an expression of dreamy detachment as if they were rain drops or snow flakes or falling stones
merle turns watching nick as he crosses toward him
when nick reaches the table he stands
hey how are you
i thought you went home
this is stolen
i came back
merles self possession has thrown him
he doesnt know where to start
breaking the silence hows linda
merle what the hell are you doing
eyes him i like it nick
hey merle listen
stares at him why
for a moment merle doesnt answer
his eyes are pale like faded robins eggs and they seem to look through nick as if to some landscape far beyond
i like it because its simple
a beautiful vietnamese girl steps up and whispers something in merles ear
stands i have to go nick
well have a drink
merle and the vietnamese girl move into the crowd
nick starts after them
he can see them ahead moving rapidly through a group of arvn officers and whores
nick sees he can never overtake them directly
he cuts around to the terrace
nick maneuvers his way down to the end of the terrace
nick reaches the end of the terrace
merle and the beautiful vietnamese girl have disappeared
nick sits at one of the tables
the terrace is deserted
gentleman on the right will now commence play
the gaming tables are utterly deserted
as nick wanders suddenly nick can stand it no more
he turns and starts toward the entrance to the bleachers
a shot explodes over the p
nick freezes then he runs
nick appears at the back of the aisle between the bleachers
the crowd is going wild yelling and screaming
nick pushes through a group of bettors and then stops
a look of stunned relief spreads over his features
on the stage a tall figure stands alone in the spotlight head bowed in acknowledgement of the ovation
he begins yelling and screaming along with everyone else
on the stage the tall figure raises his head pumps his fists in the air and begins hooting maniacally
pipes crisscross the ceiling and there is the faint hiss of leaking steam
seated on a bench and all dressed up in their uniforms are five old vets
two vets are on the nod
the other three rheumy eyed and ancient give patient attention to the sixth vet who stands beside the boiler with a bugle trying to play taps
up a little there
what would you say
the vet with the bugle tries it again flubs it starts over
three tables have been set up in the middle of the floor
the tables have been laid with white cloth and the older women are setting out fresh flowers and laying the places for a funeral breakfast
they work in silence fussing over the placement of each knife and fork
gradually one by one the older women stop fussing with the table
they stand motionless listening
a hearse waits at the curb
the day is windless cold and grey snow is drifting down and the gleaming vehicle emits a ghostly cloud of white exhaust
in the ringing silence of the musics end the doors to the church swing open
nick vince albert and john appear with merles flag draped coffin
followed by mourners they bear the coffin slowly down the steps
snow drifts down from a leaden sky as the mourners stand together on a steep hillside of tilted weather worn headstones
the mill looms behind them breathing roiling clouds of steam and uttering a dull concordia of clanks and groans
the priest completes his reading of the rd psalm
the mourners join in the lords prayer
camera closes on nick vince albert john and sal
they help sal to the side of the grave
it is awkward
the chair gets stuck and they have to carry it
they all pick up a handful of dirt and then following nicks lead they throw it in
nick steps back from the grave nods to the vets
the vets come to attention
the vet with the bugle steps forward and tremblingly but perfectly plays taps
the meal is over
the women are drinking coffee the men are smoking and putting down the beer
there is muted laughter and conversation
nick sits at the head of one of the tables flanked by linda and sal
he looks stunned
his food is untouched there are tears in his eyes and he hardly seems to know where he is
eat something nick
eat a piece of toast
nick nods picks up a piece of toast and then forgetting all about it lays it absently on his plate
vince comes up behind nick looking somewhat officious in a new blue suit
you want to say a few words nick
i think you should
like that would wind things up
vince raps on a glass
awright everybody nick has a few words
very shaky i just
would like to say a few words
i guess merle always wanted something
i dont know
that fucking guy he saved my life
he saved sals
what merle liked he liked things right
but then there wasnt any place for that
that he could find
tears are streaming down nicks face and he sits down looking miserable
john goes to the piano hurried along by vince
he sits down casts a quick glance to the ceiling and begins playing america the beautiful
a few voices being singing
others join in
albert stands up
then everyone stands up
