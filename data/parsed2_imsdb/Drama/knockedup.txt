written by judd apatow ben stone cute in a chunky jewish guy sort of way boxes one of his roommates martin
his other roommates jay and jason fight with broom sticks
jonah drinks beer on the couch spectating
we see ben and jay fighting
at one point they fight with gloves which are on fire balancing on a plank over a dirty pool
ben now has a fishbowl filled with weed smoke over his head
there is a smoking joint in his mouth making the bowl get cloudier and cloudier
he starts coughing hysterically and takes it off
a boom box is playing
the boys are now free style rapping
it is terrible but they are having a blast
pot is being smoked
beer is around
ben and roommates ride a terrifying rollercoaster
alison scott pretty wakes up to her radio alarm
allisons sister debbie sleeps on the floors of the bedroom while her husband pete sleeps on the bed with their eight year old daughter sadie
charlotte age three jumps on the bed
sadie wake up

they smoke a joint and drink beers

cause this is serious
you dont shave your beard or cut your hair for one year and if you can do that i will pay your rent
but if you shave then you have to pay all five of our rents

you guy cant make fun of the me the whole time
but martin its a competition

im not poor or anything but i eat a lot of spaghetti
so the web page is it just something that you guys do for fun
do you have a real job
well that is our job
we dont technically get money for the hours we put in but it is our job
so how do you
how do i pay rent and shit
when i was in high school i got ran over by a postal truck
oh my god
it was my foot more than anything
but i got fourteen grand from the british columbia government
and that really lasted me until now
its been almost ten years
i have like nine hundred bucks left
so that should last me for im not a mathematician but like another two years or some shit
so i have something i really need to tell you
its kind of why i called you
here it goes
with a baby
youre the father
im the father
how the fuck could this happen
i dont know
i thought you were wearing a condom
because you told me not to
what are you talking about
what am i talking about
you told me not to
i did not tell you not to wear a condom
heres what happened okay
i will give you a play by play of my memory
i almost had the condom on my dick
it was on the cusp and then you said just do it already
i didnt mean do it without a condom
i mean do it like hurry up like get fucking going
well i assumed you were wearing a patch or like a dental dam or one of those fuckin butterfly clips or something like that
what the hell is a dental dam
its like saran wrap
its disgusting okay
but i thought you had one
why the fuck didnt you stop me once we started
oh my god
i dont know
i couldnt tell that you didnt have one on
obviously i was drunk

did you think its the thinnest condom on earth i have on
im a fuckin inventor
i made a dick skin condom
he hollowed out a penis and put it on
what the fuck
you are unbelievable
okay you know what
maybe ive reacted unfavorably
so what happens now
i dont know how this works
i am going to the doctor next week
and i thought you could come with me to the gynecologist
so you havent seen him though
so you dont know if youre pregnant
well im not a hundred percent sure
youre not a hundred percent sure
i bet youre not pregnant
ben and alison sit in the crowded waiting room

i cant believe you did this
you fucked everything up
look the real point is not to get yourself in this position

i just dont get how i tell the kid not to do drugs when i do drugs
ill feel like a hypocrite
well you remember what i told you
when you were a teenager
what did you say
i said no pill no powders
thats right thats right
if it grows in the ground its probably okay
i guess it worked
you told me not to smoke pot all those years
and then i found out you were smoking pot that whole time
not the whole time
just in the evenings and all day every weekend
not that much
honestly though when you look at me do you not think at all like you know if he just never existed i would have avoided a massive heap of trouble

i know we didnt plan this and neither of us really thought it was gonna happen but life is like that you know
you cant plan for it and even if we did life doesnt care about your plans necessarily and you just kinda have to go with the flow and i just
know my job is to just support you in whatever it is you wanna do
im in so whatever you wanna do im gonna do
alison weeps softly into the phone
im on board
i really appreciate you saying that
ill tell you maybe if you could help me by telling me like one thing that i am supposed to do then that would be good cause i literally have
no idea whatsoever

alison and ben sit in a booth over appetizers

if this hadnt happened i dont think i would have wanted to have a baby for like i dont know at least ten years
god honestly i just got used to the notion that someone would even have sex with me
i didnt think this would happen
ben puts on a baby hat and holds a baby outfit in front of him
this will be coming out of you in seven months
this is exactly what our baby will look like
its a beautiful picture ben
its not bad
in a french accent hello mommy

ben and alison browse the baby section
what to expect when youre expecting
what can we expect
well you cant eat sushi
you cant smoke
you cant smoke marijuana
you cant smoke crack
and you cant jump on trampolines
this is basically a giant list of things you cant do
it sounds thrilling
im gonna be sitting there on the trampoline smoking crack

youre gonna be bored
but i cant wait to read these honestly
i put these in front of my toilet though theyll be read by tomorrow morning
do you want me to get you that

i like you a lot
thats all this is
i like you too

where do babies come from
where do you think they come from
well i think a stork he drops it down and then a hole goes in your body and theres blood everywhere coming out of your head and then you push
your belly button and then your butt falls off and then you hold you butt and you have to dig and you find a little baby
thats exactly right
ben is in a playhouse with sadie while charlotte jumps on the trampoline

ben are looks at baby bjorn baby carriers
he brings ones to alison

alison and ben walk over to debbie who is in front of a crib
this is it
this is perfect
ben looks at the price tag
holy shit its fourteen hundred bucks
we can just borrow yours

whispering to alison shh
well take it obviously
i mean dont insult the woman
she wants to get us a gift
want to buy me some new clothes
what else can i squeeze out of you
alison and ben are carrying clothes to the car
alison stops in her tracks when she sees a group of two young women and a man approaching
its so hot in the valley
oh my god
oh its so good to see you
oh my god
weve been watching you on e
its the coolest thing
yeah its been super exciting just crazy busy
im so sorry i havent called

i went to school with alison
so okay so is debbie having another baby
i just saw you a couple months ago
it was a big surprise
its a really funny story actually if you guys if you got a second to hear it
its not really funny
its not funny
let them be the judge okay
i think its funny
you know they say dont drink and drive
dont drink and bone
ben and pete browse the records
yeah she was acting weird and i really think its just because i havent made an honest woman out of her
shes carrying my bastard child
no one wants that
thats what i did
i married debbie when she got pregnant
you think shes like hiding me
like shes like embarrassed by me or something like that
id hide you
how much do wedding rings cost
it really depends you know
i think youre supposed to spend three months pay on a ring
thatll be easy
i dont make any money
i thought there was a lot of money in porn
god its not porn
all we do is we show you what nude scenes are in what movies
like mister skin
whos mister skin
dude mister skin
pete imitates the mister skin logo smile
ben and the roommates look at the mister skin website
weve wasted fourteen months of our lives
this is exactly the same as our site
how the fuck did this happen
thats even a better name than ours
well fuck me in the beard
dude they got the top ten group shower scenes
why didnt you think of that jay
dont put this on me
god damn it
i saw it online at one point but i guess i didnt connect the dots
what are we gonna do now
all we need to do is think of a new better idea that no one else has thought of already
spiderman three starts in eight minutes
well figure it out
jonah jason and martin exit
ben and jay sit at the desk
you know what
just because this site exists doesnt mean ours wont work
good things come in pairs
volcano dantes peak
deep impact armageddon
wyatt earp tombstone
panda express yoshinoya beef bowl
we can work together
this helps us if anything
alison sits on the bed while ben kneels in front of her
alison im sure this isnt how you pictured it being exactly and its not how i wanted it
that is why im presenting you with this empty box
its a promise alison
a promise that one day i will fill this with a ring that you deserve a beautiful ring
i cant afford it yet
ive picked it out though
its at de beers and its really nice
so basically im asking you will you marry me
because im in love with you
i love you too
thats so nice to hear
thats the first time a girls ever said that to me
but heres the thing
theres a thing
i dont really know yet what that love means
its so new and its so exciting
i dont know
weve only known each other for seventeen weeks
look i thought you felt weird that were having a baby and were not engaged
im going to get off my knee
ben sits next to alison on the bed
im okay with that
were just doing what we can
i dont want us to put any more pressure on ourselves than we have
that makes sense
i didnt hurt your feelings did i
i just wanted to do right by you
if you dont want to thats totally cool
i really do love you
you mentioned that
debbie and alison eat ice cream in bed and watch tv
ben proposed to me
it was really sweet
i feel a little bad
he was wearing this great button down
he tucked it in
he got down on one knee
he didnt have an actual ring though just an empty box but he had this whole spiel about when he has the money hell buy me the ring i deserve
the box was empty
he cant afford a ring
so he got down on one knee and gave you an empty box
get over it
if youd been there you would have cried
you need to train him
oprah said that when two people meet they should point out each others differences and flaws
i thought you should love people for who they are
you criticize them a lot so they get so down on themselves they have to change
you dont think thats naggy
in the end they thank you for it
debbie drives alison and the girls in her car
you cant commit to him
you dont even know him
i dont even know pete after ten years
i dont know what hes up to
why do you say that
i think hes cheating on me
hes always going to business meetings at odd hours
then i try to call him on his cell phone and he says hes in bad cell phone reception areas when hes in good reception areas
maybe hes working late
maybe hes trying to sign a new band
i cant imagine pete doing that
theres no part of you that thinks maybe hes a dirty little scumbag
i think he might be
debbie installs software on the computer while alison watches
memory spy web memory software
locate history files websites visited hidden downloads e mail history
lets see you hide from me now little man
alison is disturbed by this whole ordeal
debbie pete alison and ben eat dinner together
youre not going to tell them
i dont have to
its illegal for them to fire me over it
and i get three months maternity leave if i stay
so im not going to tell them
i like it
its a good plan until her water breaks over robert de niros shoes
impersonating robert de my shoes
theres baby goo on them
impersonating robert de these shoes
on these shoes
did you puke on my shoes
impersonating robert de is your water on my shoes
back as pete isnt it weird though when you have a kid and all your dreams and hopes go right out the window
what changed for you
what went out the window
you do everything exactly the same
no i love what im doing
but say before youre married with children you want to live in india for a year
you can do it
you want to go to india
go to india
do you want to go to india
you can go
i get what he means
honestly when i found out about
ben motions towards alison
i had this flash of me in a white ford bronco hauling ass for canada
the choppers taping it and i bust through the border and im free
i kept thinking that
alison stares at ben
it was a flash
what do you mean
dont look at me
we can talk about our fears here
if doc brown screeched up to you in the delorean and said alison i got the car here
what do you want to do
no part of you would think maybe ill go back to that night and put a condom on bens dick
you never got that flash
what are you talking about
where were going we dont need roads
you wouldnt do that
i dont know who doc brown is
what are you talking about
doc brown is christopher lloyd
he invented the delorean time machine
everyone has a time machine image
i have a really good idea
why dont you two get in your time machine go back in time and fuck each other
who needs a time machine
ben holds up his drink
this is my time machine
ill throw you in my delorean and gun it to
you are a funny motherfucker man
how can you fight with him
i just want to kiss his face
i like the way you move
this is fun
we should do this more
this is the most fun ive had in a really long time
ben and alison are having sex
ben is on top
come on harder
just do it deeper
ill poke the baby if i go deeper
just do it
please dont yell at me
the doctor and debbie said its fine
im sorry can we change positions
im going to crush the baby
no its not
it has no shell
millions of people have sex when theyre pregnant
it just works
i weigh over pounds
just get over it
i cant do it
can you just get on top
all i can see if our baby poked in the face by my penis
trust me youre not even close
alison moves on top
alison abruptly stops
i cant do this
i cant focus like this
i look disgusting from this angle
i can feel you looking at my chins
you look beautiful
your chin looks so skinny
and my boobs are all like squishy and theyre flopping around
i can feel it and its distracting
its all national geographic
do you want to do it doggie style
i do not want you to fuck me like a dog
im not fucking you like a dog
its doggie style
its just the style
im its not like a dog
we dont have to go outside or anything
ben and alison lie down side by side ben is behind
here we go
is it good
should i go slower
just tell me when youre close
just go harder
it kicked my hand
it always kicks
no no no no no
not like this
no this was a warning kick
just keep going
this was a bad kick
my dick must be like an inch away from its face and its coming just coming in at its face
what if it kicked because it didnt like it
i cant do that to our baby
thats the first thing its going to see
what are you talking about
its having the baby between us it just makes it weird
it just freaks me out a bit
its a little weird
i have totally lost it now
youve totally lost it
ive lost it
great you know what
just forget it
alison turns her back to ben and gets settled to sleep
holding back tears dont worry
i wont make you do this again
ben smokes his bong
suddenly there is an earthquake
alison wakes up from the earthquake in a panic
ben stands up and tries to steady himself
jay runs through the room towards the front door
oh my god
its the russians
martin carries jodi out
ill protect you
ben clutches his bong and runs to the door
alison runs to the door as well
oh my god
jay martin alison jodi jonah jason and ben stand on the street
jason is naked
jonahs girlfriend alex is also naked
that was horrible
that was so horrible
youre fine man
when will it be light out
take it easy
when will it be light out
did anybody turn off the gas
i didnt do it
jason runs back to the house
martin this is my friend alex
shes a pretty incredible person
nice to meet you
martin holds out his hand to shake alexs
she removes one hand from covering her breast to shake his hand
jonah immediately covers her breast with his hand
whoa whoa whoa
not cool martin
thats that wasnt
hey are you serious howard hughes
where were you
look i forgot you were sleeping over
im sorry okay
yeah because you were getting high off your huge bong
how am i supposed to be comfortable with the idea that you can take care of me and the baby if you are always getting high
you want me to stop smoking pot because theres an earthquake once every ten years
that makes no sense alison
youre being irrational
were all scared
oh shit the cops
a cop car rolls by
ben throws his bong behind him and it shatters on the payment
ben and alison sort through the debris of porn trash and weed among other things
alison finds bens bank statement that indicates he only has only
you know its times like this im glad i dont own nice things
its a big mess but theres only like fifty bucks worth of shit here
thats kind of the good thing
you know my dad told me dont move to northridge
but you figure what are the chances of that happening twice you know
alison picks up a huge sword
what is this
its a ninja weapon
i hope this place doesnt get condemned
that would suck
alison finds a shopping bag with the baby books they bought
none of them have been read
alison sadly puts them back without ben noticing
bens phone rings
alison is at her desk at work
hey its me
will you do me a big favor
debbie wants us to come over and have dinner tonight
she thinks pete is cheating on her
well she saw one of his e mails and theres an address
i dont want to do that
ben come on
hes not cheating on her
how do you know
i just know
are you sure
im one hundred percent sure hes not cheating
are you really
it actually kind of makes sense that he would cheat
because debbies a pain in the ass and petes awesome
well why dont you just come over then and well just diffuse the situation a little
alison ben pete and debbie have dinner
im just saying the music industry is different now
steely dan would never even have a chance
well maybe its because steely dan gargles my balls
they really arent good man
old steely dan
if i ever listen to steely dan i want you to slice my head off with an al jarreau lp
i should get going
im supposed to see this band tonight in hollywood
actually theyre playing in laurel canyon so ill call you because the receptions terrible over there
and i dont want you to worry
im just going to jump in the shower
it would be terrible if i smelled worse than the band
you guys are crazy
hes acting totally normal and hilarious
debbie pulls up in front of the house in her car with alison and ben
she doesnt have a gun does she
i dont think so
debbie tries the front door its unlocked
looks like no ones home
why was the door unlocked
i just feel bad for pete
i feel like this isnt a good way to get caught cheating it shouldnt be like this
well maybe he should have thought of that before he was cheating
through a fake cough pete
what do you want from me
debbie checks upstairs
theres nobody up there
i guess i was wrong
i told you
can we get out of here please
yeah come on
a murmur comes from a far room
did you hear that
i didnt hear anything
debbie leads them into a room where pet sits with a lot of guys dressed in baseball clothing
too bad i got him three rounds ago
youre still on the clock
you gotta do something
we need a name here
ugh you just took my whole outfield
what is this
what the fuck is this
its our fantasy baseball draft
we said no wives
your fantasy what
its its our draft
for fantasy baseball
i told you all about this
debbie turns and walks out of the room
hey pete dont let the door hit you in the vagina on the way out
come on whos going
pete and debbie are in the driveway while alison and ben watch from the street
i should have told you
what else have you been lying about
that guy said dont let the door hit you in the vagina on the way out
where were you on wednesday
im going to be honest with you
yeah i heard him
that was hilarious
that would be a good idea
youve been mad because ive been working so much and i didnt want to upset you
i wouldnt be mad
you would be
i dont get mad
its a fantasy baseball draft
im not cheating or anything
no this is worse
how is this worse
this is you wanting to be with your friends more than your family
look the reason i make that up is because if i told you what i was really doing you would just get mad
so you think im seeing a band i do my fantasy draft and its win win
well what did you do last wednesday night when you said you went to see a band
i went to the movies
whatd you see
why do you want to go by yourself
why didnt you ask me to go
because i needed to get away you know
with work and you and the kids sometimes i just need some time to myself
i need time for myself
i want time for myself too
debbie holds back tears
youre not the only one
its not that big of a deal
i like spiderman
okay so lets see spiderman three next week
i dont want to go see it now
i dont want to have to ask you to ask me
i want you to just come up with it on your own
i dont even know what to say
uh what do you want me to do
you just think because you dont yell that youre not mean but this is mean
im not being mean
im being honest
youre telling me i need to be honest
no youre not
im doing it because i need to keep my sanity a little bit
you know what
i dont want you at the house anymore
debbie heads for the car
oh shit shes coming back
alison drives to the gynecologist with ben
how come we go to the gynecologist so often
i bet we have to go so much so we can pay for that three hundred thousand dollar machine he has
i cannot stop thinking about what an asshole pete is
thats a little strong i would say
because that had to be one of the most selfish things ive ever witnessed
i even think its kind of funny
whats funny about it
well you wont laugh now i wouldnt imagine but you know the situation
we break into this strangers house thinking were going to find him sleeping with a woman and then its a bunch of nerds playing fantasy baseball
if you saw that on television you would laugh
is that what you think
is that what you want to do ben
i dont even like baseball
im just saying when youre a guy and you have a family and you have responsibility you lose that male camaraderie and i get that
i totally understand where hes coming from
why do you guys always go to that place
you miss male camaraderie
what do i give a shit
go hang out with your bearded freak friends
i dont care
you want to hang out with guys that look like the shoe bomber its all on you man
well what the fuck am i supposed to say to that
you should just support me
you know you should just support everything i say because at this juncture in my life im allowed to be wrong
so if youre wrong i have to support it
i cant tell you that youre acting like a lunatic
oh thats helpful
you have to do nothing
ive sacrificed a lot of shit to this
you are just fucking sitting there
you havent sacrificed anything
ive had to sacrifice my job my body my youth my vagina
youve sacrificed your vagina
it will never look the same after this
ill pay for vaginal reconstructive surgery
you cant pay for shit
you can barely buy spaghetti
you know what
get out of the car
you know what
why dont you not threaten me
you should just get out of the fucking car
im not going to get out of the car in the middle of nowhere
get out of the car
i own this car
get out of my car
get out of my car
get out of my fucking car
ben gets out of the car and immediately knocks on the window
can you let me back in the car please
have you calmed down
did you take a breath
i have no clue where we are
alison just glares at him
alison drives off
alison stands on a scale while dr
howards nurse weighs her
you know what
maybe i should take my shoes off
or my belt buckle
my belt buckles huge
dont worry about gaining weight
your baby wants you to gain a whole mess of weight
ben walks into the room winded
are you fucking kidding me
why dont you take off your earrings too
they weigh about eighty pounds
theyre made out of moon rocks arent they
do not make fun of me
i am hormonal i am terrified and i am falling apart so stop treating everything like its a big joke
im sorry youre freaking out but i just walked three fucking miles through koreatown to get here
sorry if im trying to lighten the mood a little
the nurse leaves
you cant take anything seriously
you didnt even read the baby books
i didnt read the baby books
whats gonna happen
how did anyone ever give birth without a baby book
thats right the ancient egyptians fucking engraved what to expect when youre expecting on the pyramid walls
i forgot about that
who gives a flying fuck about the baby books
it just shows your lack of commitment ben
that youre not in this with me
did you just say my lack of commitment
because thats what it sounded like
it almost seems as though you forgot i proposed to you like an asshole
and you said no to me
if you feel that way you should just go
because we didnt mean to do this together okay
and and we tried to make it work and that was good i suppose
alison holds back tears
but it doesnt work
because we are two completely different people
and i think it would just be easier for both of us if we stop fooling ourselves
you know what
i know this isnt you talking its your hormones but i would just like to say fuck you hormones
you are a crazy bitch hormones
its a girl
buy some pink shit
you are such an asshole
you know what
go fuck your fucking bong you fuck
i will fuck my bong
doggie style for once
ben exits while giving alison the finger as her walks away
howards nurse returns
are you ready
im really sorry about all that
that was really inappropriate
it happens all the time here
i dont feel so stupid then
not at all
ben and pete drink at the bar
i totally know what youre talking about man
if i wrote out the list of shit alison doesnt let me do it would be endless
dont smoke pot
dont have samurai swords in your room
dont have illegal grow operations in the house
i could go on all fucking day
have i told her to stop doing anything ever
marriage is like that show everybody loves raymond but its not funny
all the problems are the same but its
instead of all the funny pithy dialogue everybodys just really pissed off and tense
marriage is like an unfunny tense version of everybody loves raymond but it doesnt last twenty two minutes
it lasts forever
lets get out of here man
honestly lets just go
lets go to vegas
lets do it
alison watches a pregnancy show on tv
debbie marches into the guest house

debbie turns off the television
what are you doing

and have fun
im just so tired
i know youre tired
but were going to be untired

i hate you so much sometimes
were going to be positive
how many red bulls have you had
ive had about three red bulls in the last fifteen minutes
and i feel fabulous

ben and pete knock on the front door
since when do we lock this fucking thing
jason opens the door with jonah and jay
all of their eyes are very infected
we cant go dude
we got pink eye
you giving each other butterfly kisses or something
thats not how you get pink eye
you get it from poo particles making their way into your ocular cavities
hows it going
i farted on jasons pillow as a practical joke
he farted on jonahs thinking it was mine
and then eventually pink eyes my pillow
im not proud of this
but i think weve all forgiven each other
but we cant go anywhere
you can get pink eye from farting in a pillow
yeah but you got to be bare assed
martin enters the doorway his eyes are the worst
martin got it bad
what did someone take a dump right in your eye
no pink eye for me
im just really
well stay back guys
i got to get my suit
ben enters the house and the guys pretend theyre going to rub their faces on him
pete stays outside

jason shuts the door on pete
pete drives with ben to vegas
they are wearing suits
this is fun
this is great

she cant train this
im like siegfried and roys bengal

ill bite your fucking face off
in front of a crowd baby

pete brandishes a bag of mushrooms

ben and pete receive lap dances from topless strippers

the stripper straddles pete and pulls his tie through her legs so that he face is pulled against her butt
you got my tie

now thats how you get pink eye
debbie and alison approach the nightclub passing the line straight to the doorman
the doorman lets two pretty girls past the rope

im not going to go to the end of the fucking line

i have just as much of a right to be here as any of these little skanky girls
what am i not skanky enough for you
you want me to hike up my fucking skirt
what the fuck is your problem
im not going anywhere
youre just some roided out freak with a fucking clipboard
and your stupid little fucking rope
you may have power now but youre not god
youre a doorman
youre a doorman
fuck you you fucking fag with your fucking little faggy gloves
the doorman grabs debbie and takes her aside
come here come on
the doorman takes debbie aside
im so sorry
i fucking hate this job
i dont want to be the one to pass judgement and decide who gets in
this shit makes me sick to my stomach
i get the runs from the stress
its not because youre not hot
i would love to tap that ass
i would tear that ass up
i cant let you in because youre old as fuck
for this club not you know for the earth
cant have a bunch of old pregnant bitches running around
im only allowed to let in five percent black people
he said that
that mean if theres twenty five people here i get to let in one and a quarter black people
so i got to hope theres a black midget in the crowd
now i feel guilty
why yall want to be in here anyway
yall need to be at a yoga class or something
what the fuck is she doing at the club
thats not even good parenting right there
your old ass should know better than that
debbie takes alison away
ben and pete hold neon yard glasses and walk past numerous swimsuit clad men and women
have the mushrooms kicked in yet
ben and pete chuckle uncontrollably
ben and pete watch from the crowd as acrobats climb poles
this was a great idea man
this is the best idea ive ever had in my life
two bare chested male acrobats start to balance on top of each other
what are they going to do
what in the world are they doing
if i shaved my stomach and my chest i would look exactly like that
those guys are at work right now
imitating one of the whatd you do today
oh just lifted my brother
the crowd starts to applaud for the acrobats
im freaking out right now man
many acrobats in devilish outfits take the stage
the mushrooms are turning on me
a clown dressed as a giant baby is part of the act
ben yells frantically
i am not your papa
a giant snail comes out onto the stage
i cant deal with this shit man
ben stands up and runs down the aisle towards the exit
debbie and alison sit on the curb
dont say that
i just want to dance
i love dancing
i cant dance
i should be embarrassed
im a fucking whale and im trying to get into some stupid club and you look beautiful
youre young and youre tall and you got the good lips and boobs
im going to be alone
debbie no youre not
yes i am
i get worse looking and he gets better looking and its so fucking unfair

my babysitter always gets mad when we come home past twelve

ben curls up on the bed with his shirt and boxers on
a scene from cheaper by the dozen plays on the television
steve martin juggles all of his children

pete moves several chairs into the bedroom

pete moves to a tall chair

look at it
its gold and red and its kind of shiny
it is beautiful and it feels amazing
the tall ones gawking at me and the short ones being very droll
i dont like them
pete switches to another chair
its weird that chairs even exist when youre not sitting on them
pete switched to another tall chair
im up high
im really high up
i shouldve read the baby books
why didnt you read the baby books
because then its real you know
dude its real whether or not you read those books

pete sits on another chair
think theyll take us back
but i dont know why
do you ever wonder how somebody could even like you
all the time man
like every day
i wonder how you like me
how can debbie like me
she likes me
i mean she loves me
the biggest problem in our marriage is that she wants me around
she loves me so much that she wants me around all the time
thats our biggest problem
and i cant even accept that
uh like that upsets me
ben sits up from the bed
shes the one
she loves me
you cant believe
that people love you
i love you man
debbie loves you
i dont think i can accept her love
theres something wrong with me
you cant accept love
i dont know what it is
the most beautiful shiny warmy thing in the world
you cant accept it
i have to go to this other chair
pete switches to a new chair
oh this is a better energy
you cant accept pure love
you cant accept debbie
shes chosen to give you her life
shes picked you as her life partner
but you play fantasy baseball because you cant accept her love
i could accept it man
and debbies amazing man
shes cool and shes funny and she smells good and shes nice and her hair always looks different
shes too good for you man
pete shoves his hand in his mouth
tastes like a rainbow
youre an urchin
and she busts your balls because youre a little bitch
youre a filthy bitch
and id bust your balls
debbie wants to give her life to you and alison doesnt want to do that with me
and it makes me sad all day
i want to go home

debbie and alison set up sadies princess birthday party
everything looks beautiful
i went kind of overboard huh

ben approaches the house with a present

alison and ben talk off to the side
i just dont think we can make it work
we can get back on track and everythings going to be great
youre just being nice
and im being nice and just because were two nice people doesnt mean we should stay together
i dont want this baby to determine the rest of our lives
me not wanting to do this alone isnt enough of a reason to drag you into a relationship with me
its just not fair
and and dont repeat this but god i dont want to end up like debbie
but debbies happy
shes happy today
but every day is a constant struggle for them because theyre not right for each other
and they have to force it and i dont want us to have to do that
i dont want to force you to be what i think you should be
thats wrong of me because youre great
you really are
youre great the way you are and i mean you like to get high and you like to do shrooms in vegas
i didnt do shrooms in vegas
and who am i to stop you
who am i to tell you that thats wrong
its not wrong
its who you are
its what you enjoy and thats your life and
im not that guy anymore
we can be friends
and you can be there when the baby is born and in the babys life as much as you want
i hope you will be
if you give me a shot to just show you that im con debbie approaches

ben stomps back into the kitchen
pete is carrying the birthday cake

if youre pregnant theyre pregnant you can talk about being pregnant
it just grosses me out
when i know that people are pregnant
because i think about the birth

alison i need you to turn on your back now okay
the babys heart rate is slowing
its going to be okay
kuni is it going to be fine
alison turns onto her back
its going to be fine
youre going to feel a little bit of a push
kuni tries to reposition the baby
what are you doing
im turning the baby so i can take the pressure off the cord
oh my god
the monitors stops beeping
the heartbeats stronger but were not out of the woods
we need to get things going now
i think the cord is wrapped around the neck
so im going to give you some medicine pop the bag and get things going okay
i dont want to leave the baby in there for long and we can give you some medicine for the pain
no no no no
i dont want the baby to be born all drugged out
its not my birth plan
now things change
we dont have time to debate this
but no im not comfortable with that
would you please just listen to her
do what you want to do
whoa whoa whoa what
should i leave
do you want to be the doctor
because i really dont need to be here
what we want is to take a second to talk about our options okay
thats all we want
you mean you want to take a second to tell me how to do my job
my job is to get that baby out safely
or i can go home
you just let me know
you be the doctor
can we talk outside in the hall for a second
ben and dr
kuni stand in the hallway
that woman is a control freak and she needs to let go and let me do my job
look shes just having a hard time because her and her doctor had a very specific birth plan
and they wanted it to be a very special experience
if you want a special experience go to a jimmy buffet concert
we have a new birth plan get the baby out safely
look man will you help us out
i have no idea what im doing
you can be as big a dick to me as you want
just be nice to her man
thats all i ask
just please be nice to her
bens stomach growls loudly
are you okay
i think so
lets start fresh
thank you man
this is healthy
this is good
i think were bonding
kuni and ben come back into the room
alison i apologize for being a little brash but if youre okay with it its rather important we break the bag and give you some medicine to speed things up
because once the bag is broken i dont want there to be an infection
do what you have to do
whispering to ben oh my god
what a nightmare that guy is
i know i know
look i talked to him
i think hell be more cool now
im so sorry i broke up with you
you really dont need to be
and you know i knew youd give me another shot
i figured itd be a lot sooner than this you know
i was just in such a panic from all of this
and watching debbie and pete together and my ass got so fat
i just never for one minute thought that the guy who got me pregnant would actually be the right guy for me
i guess he is
martin and jonah wheel around the corner in wheelchairs
all right martin who am i
people think im smart because i speak in a robot voice
i fuck my nurse with my ever expanding cock
im going to murderball you
jonah kicks martins wheelchair over
jonah you shithead
debbie and pete come into the room
pete holds a camcorder
i cant believe i go out of town and this happens
im sorry but im not going anywhere
all right how do you want this
you want this over the shoulder
i can do whatever you want
i can get in there
kind of spike lee angles
no you can shoot the waiting room
that would be great
well thank you
ive got it from here
can i talk to you in the hall for a second
ben and debbie talk in the hallway alone
id like to be in there with alison
i understand how you feel but this isnt up to you
look debbie you are high off your ass if you think youre coming into that room
if you take one step towards that door i will tell security theres a crazy chick in a pink dress snatching up babies
so dont even try to come into that room
thats my room now
that little area with the pepsi machine
thats your area
stay in your area
stay out of my room
back the fuck off
debbie sits down in a seat next to pete
what are you doing here
he just kicked me out
he told me to leave
but i guess its good right
he said hes going to take care of her
he really seems on his game
i think hes going to be a good dad
i think i like him
i wish id gotten that on tape
alison is in labor
she is panting
holy shit almighty
oh shit this really hurts
ah i see were well on our way
i want the epidural
give me the epidural
give it to her
give her the epidural okay
give it to her now
alison were past the point of an epidural
the cervix is fully dilated
no seriously i want an epidural
i know theres time
we cant give you the epidural
take the time
ill make sure it doesnt come out
ill stop pushing
we have time
ill stop oh please please please
just do it please
we have no time
were going to just have to do this the all natural way okay
the way you wanted to do it
here comes another contraction okay
i want you to push
good good good
i feel everything
oh my god
maybe we can take it down just a little
i think youre going to scare the other pregnant women
are you fucking kidding me
are you kidding me
alisons shrieking is heard in the waiting room
this is messed up
somethings wrong in there
i mean granted gynecologys only a hobby of mine but it sounds to me like shes crowning
is that right deb
thats what it sounds like for everyone
everyone goes through this
no i disagree with you
that sounds terrible
im going to go sneak a peek see if theres anything i can do
jay goes to alisons room
alison is in agony
kuni and nurses are hunched around her
im seeing the head
honey what does it look like ben
been peers down between alisons legs
we actually see the crowning shot as the babys head is being pushed out of alisons vagina
you dont want to see it
you dont no i want to see it
you dont want to though
no i want to see
a nurse holds a mirror for alison
she sees the actual crowning shot
okay were almost home
one two jay bursts in
you okay in here
jay sees the crowning shot
jay solemnly returns to his chair
you all right buddy
what did it look like
i shouldnt have gone in there
dont go in there
promise me you dont go in there
me go in there
thats the last fucking place i want to go
like im going to go in there
try getting a boner now
jason beams at debbie
whats up deb
pete looks at debbie
the birth is still in progress
one two three
youve passed the shoulders
one more big push
the baby comes out
kuni cleans it up
i did it
you did it
you did it
oh my god you did it
kuni hands the baby to alison
i love you ben
i love you so much too
oh my god
congratulations you two
you did so great
you were amazing
you got out
you made it out
you ever get so bored you just stare at your balls
i bet you do late john lennon
here we go again
whispering to pete who is that
is that bens rabbi
is he the one who cuts the penis
i think its matisyahu
you want out of the bet
i want out of the bet
you know what you have to say
just say it man
i think now is the time
jason youre the master
you heard it right
youre out of the bet
martin hugs jason
your face smells like an old mans balls
debbie and pete come to check in on alison
oh my god
i love you ben
i love you debbie
were going to have another baby
pete turns the camera on himself and shakes his head no
ben enters the waiting room to talk to the guys
gentlemen its a girl
they all hug
we got a daughter
we got a beautiful little girl
lets meet her
a beautiful little girl
lets meet her
alison sleeps while ben holds the baby
everyone else has gone home
to the baby and then your mommy said just do it already which was very confusing to daddy
so i listened to the most literal translation of that and i just did it already
what would you do
dont tell mommy but it was the smartest thing i ever did listening to her because now youre here
isnt that nice
i think it is
ben and a nurse push alison and the baby in a wheelchair
ben drives while alison and the baby are in the back seat
i hope your apartments big enough for the three of us
it definitely is
thats why i got one in east la
the only thing is we have to decide if were going to be crips or bloods before we get there
well i look good in red
i look good in blue
the fighting continues
we could just throw off everyone and become latin kings
we both look good in gold
i would yell at you about driving so slow except the babys here
no these guys can honk all they want
i aint going faster than twelve
it might take us around three hours to get home though
the car moves slowly down the highway with a line of cars waiting behind them
