written by craig brewer only one kind of blues
and that consists between male and female
son house rae is naked
wrapped around her shoulders is a loose knit spread that conceals her slender form
she is in her s a strawberry blond with cinnamon freckles spotted across her pale skin
she is beautiful without trying
she stares at the distant trees
this is the south the small town of fisherville tennessee
soon rae will be alone
ronnie is years old
his hair is cropped in a military issue buzz
raes face is wet with tears as ronnie gently makes love to her
she touches his face and sobs like a child
ronnie is dressed in his national guard fatigues packing up his gear
rae is now wearing a short jeans skirt and a t shirt with a gray wolf print ironed on the front
there is a knock at the door
ronnie opens the door revealing gill morton ronnies buddy from high school
still need a lift
gill and raes eyes meet
gill sees that rae is crying
gonna have a smoke
ronnie shuts the door and feels a wave of sudden nausea
he rushes past rae
ronnie is vomiting into the toilet as rae rubs his head
each painful dry heave makes rae comfort him more
ronnie places his duffle bag in gills truck
rae begins to cough
rae doesnt answer
gill backs away allowing ronnie and rae some privacy
the two lovers stare into each others eyes and then embrace
rae peeks over ronnies shoulder at gill with an expression of dread
anger seizes her
this aint gonna work
i dont see why we gotta lie bout it when you and i know this aint gonna work
holds her face in his hands rae dont do this now
its so fucking stupid
tears stream down her face
reaches in his pocket look it
i got somethin for us
this is gonna help okay
you gonna miss your bus
ronnie removes a small digital watch and fastens it around her wrist
this watch here is gonna beep at midnight
thats when it comes up on you the hardest right
ronnie holds out his own wrist to show her his identical watch
and wherever im at my watchll beep too
well be thinkin bout each other at the same time
wherever we are
rae is shaking
he grips her by the back of her neck and pushes their faces inches away
eye to eye
i gotta believe we can do this or i aint gonna make it rae
rae sees the fear in his eyes
she swallows her own anxiety and nods
they kiss passionately
i love you
afraid of his swelling emotion ronnie quickly breaks away from her
rae watches as her love leaves in gills pick up
compelled to follow she absently walks after the truck down the gravel drive
she is alone
an intense wave of sorrow hits like a kick to her gut
she gasps for breath as she struggles to hold back the flood of her tears
rae drops to her knees right there in the gravel drive
her hair falls in front of her face masking her grief
her shoulders shudder
her middle finger begins to scratch at her thigh repeatedly a nervous habit that has always accompanied this burning sensation that consumes her
tears come to her
shes not going to be able to stop it
shouting in frustration rae is gripping the watch around her wrist for comfort
her breathing is already out of her control
the dizziness is already upon her
the familiar burning
she inhales in gasps rocking back and forth on her knees
the late morning cicadas chirp in an undulating frenzy
shaking her head mm mm meaning no mm mm
the scratching at her leg leaves a red mark
she is dizzy with anxiety
her teeth are clenched her face is flush
tehronne is fucking rae from behind
tehronne is a muscular dark skinned black male in his late twenties
raes face is crammed up against the mirror in the small bathroom
tehronne gets faster and pushes harder a stark contrast to her lovemaking with ronnie
a severe coughing fit hits her
she pushes him away with her ass
were done right
walking with his hands shoved deep into his pockets wearing his only suit and tie is lazarus woods laz
he is in his late fifties black a strong face under his old fedora
he stares across the street into dunns cafe
rose woods black early forties stands in the cafe
she looks confident and resolute in her new green skirt
a brown delta olds pulls up into a parking space in front of laz
stepping out is reverend r
lazs longtime friend
he is also black and in his late fifties
you aint gonna make a fuss are you
no answer nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind
i never laid a hand on her in anger
not a day
not even when is drinkin
but this business got me wonderin what a good shake and slap would do for her
that kind of talk is between us
dont you go in there with that shit on your tongue
i didnt start this r
laz tries to stop his lip from quivering the man is hurting
you wanna pray with me fore you go in
touches lazs arm and bows his head heavenly father
s prayer is heard as laz opens the front door to the cafe
he looks ill
each step is painful
we do not question your divine plan for us oh god
but in these times when our spirit lies in shadow
when we are lost
laz crosses to roses booth the distance seems to stretch out into eternity
we ask that you give us strength
give us strength that surpasses all understanding
in your name we pray
laz sits across from his wife
cant remember the last time i saw you in that suit

the waitress is kind and twangy as she asks for their order

rose doesnt answer
lazarus softens touching her hand
folks get sick

laz has lost her for good
i deserve better than this
better than what you give
you cant say nothin
if we get with a counselor
at the church maybe theys
the final interruption i dont love ya no more
the words are daggers
laz is wounded beyond concealment
rose picks up her purse preparing to leave
im sorry you hurtin
but like i say this the only life i got
waits for him to respond i said my piece
she stands and attempts to walk away
laz grips her tightly by the wrist
god forgive you for how you done me
my daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry
and thats what you did
ya bled me
let go of my arm
woulda chopped my arm off if you asked
and this how you do me

the whole cafe is silent
all eyes are on rose
to customers yeah goon

tehronne is taking his time hanging his ice around his neck and wrists as he stands shirtless before the mirror

tehronne catches raes wrist as she goes to slap
he quickly yanks her arm behind her back and bends her backwards shoving his face close to her own
he grips the money in a fist and cocks it to punch all in jest
you gonna get rough
is that what you doin
raes chest begins to heave with deep breaths
tehronne looks down at her legs as she anxiously rubs them together
shakes his head i swear i seen some buck wild bitches in my time but you the illest i ever seen
rae gets control of the burning
she takes the money

rae is prancing up the walkway on the square
two young men dressed for construction pass rae
its already noon rae
you think that skirt should still be on
flips them off if it werent you could kiss my rebel cootch ya faggot
the men keep walking as rae coughs
she turns toward the fisherville grocery
cough drops or condoms
rae stops in her tracks looking up at her estranged mother sandy smoking a cigarette outside the grocery store
sandy has bleached hair with dark roots
she is in her late forties once a sexy girl now shes lost all her tread
surprised to see her didnt know you was workin here now
i just like dressin up in these goddamn blue vests

rae walks away deeply affected by sandys presence
calling after her you let me know if i can be of any assistance
laz drives an old green ford pick up
he pulls the truck up to the front of the feed store and kills the engine
lincoln a year old black boy comes out of the open loading door

lincoln runs off
laz yanks off his black tie
lincoln slaps the last bag of mulch into the bed of lazs truck
laz hands lincoln a twenty

he takes the change

lazarus steers his tractor toward his small home in a sea of lush green kudzu
he kills the engine and looks beyond the nose of his tractor
he lights a cigarette
below the nose is the head of a rose garden with a painted sign under it roses roses
laz inhales smoke and exhales hate
the tractor lunges forward trampling the garden ripping the flowers to shreds
mayella is a heavy forty year old black woman
her blue neon tube top matches her short pants stretched across her healthy ass
she is flipping through the juke box selection

mayella saunters over to the pool table with the others

the door opens behind laz
bojo sees the man entering

laz turns to see the door shut behind his brother deke woods
he is younger than laz and a bit smaller
laz turns to bojo

deke slowly approaches laz at the bar

laz turns back to the bar
deke begins to turn but stops

till the end of my
in one quick movement laz grips deke by the throat and smashes the bottom of his bottle into jagged shards
laz pushes deke back through the joint and slams him onto the pool table
he grips dekes throat and holds the broken bottle up to his face

and god put his mark on cain for his sin

lazarus slams the bottle down on the pool table shattering it
laz lifts his hand
his own blood leaks from between his fingers
he wipes the blood across dekes face
im through witcha both
laz releases deke and exits
deke calls after him
whatchu gonna do

the bleachers are packed with three generations of fans and family cheering their boys on the high school football field
rae is sitting with her two girlfriends jesse and kell two girls who graduated five years ago
hands rae a beer ronnie ship out this mornin

takes a healthy swig i begged him not to go
and he did
screaming at the field dirty south rap pounds the ears from a hoopty olds with a backseat full of bass
rae kell and jesse are walking up to the rowdy party through the variety of parked cars
a girl rushes past the trio vomiting on herself as a friend comes to her aid
these baby chicks just cant hold their jello shots
im tellin ya
conner is one of the linebackers for the fisherville dusters
a wasted girl sits on his lap as kell rolls a joint
tennessee vols gotta practice indoors just so those florida state sons a bitches dont spy on their plays with satellites and shit

jesse notices rae coughing
she pulls her aside as conner rambles

leavin me to my own mind
thats just not good
pours a shot of vodka here
pound this and ill join you
rae and jesse take a strong shot

as they pound one more rae notices gill ronnies friend staring at her from across the room
batson and mark approach jesse and rae
they are both sophomores both skinny and harmless

rae peeks at gill maneuvering through the room
rummages in his pockets got eight packs of dxm
got a shit load of coricidin if you want to get out a body nall

rae pushes through the crowd of drunken kids to get to gill
its not like i cant go out and have fun with my friends
you think im ronnies spy or somethin
come tomorrow that dumb ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin to keep his head on his shoulders
you think hes gonna be thinkin about you

rae pushes through the crowd back toward the others
to batson how many to fuck me up
quick cuts of batson popping out five red cough pills
rae swallowing all five and chasing them with vodka
conners girl falls off his lap
the laughter echoes and grows as we close angles we never quite see the whole of what is implied
raes eyes jesses mouth a boys shoulder
the room is packed with bodies
rae laughs with pleasure as her eyes attempt to focus
the kid on top of her finishes and rolls off
whats so funny
jesse is straddling a guy in an arm chair chinese eyed and bouncing
rae tries to respond coherently as another football player rolls her over on all fours and takes her from behind
im just on a water bed
and its just
a few coughs
rae focuses to see a younger guy sitting at her eye level
you aint the kicker are you
cuz let me tell you you boys gotta run the ball more
you get into a kicking game yall gonna lose
can i put it in your mouth
laz kills the rest of his whiskey
he squeezes his eyes closed as the liquor burns his throat
he tosses the bottle into a trash bag he is holding
laz continues throwing out all of roses make up and hair products
with one broad sweep he cleans off her vanity
laz opens the front door and tosses the two bags outside
stumbling he kneels next to the coiled radiator against the wall opposite the door
he talks to it like an old friend
seem like you and me
we drove her away
thats what we did
singing softly drinkin muddy water
asleep in a hollow log
laz pulls out a guitar case from under the bed
he wipes a layer of dust off and opens it
he gently cradles the guitar in his big hands and sits at his kitchen table
tunes the strings
he closes his eyes swimming in drunken sorrow
you gonna do this
laz plays the blues mississippi bentonian style one guitar one voice a mess of pain
singing his eyes closed just like a bird without a feather you know im lost without your love
just like a bird without a feather you know im lost without your love
you know i need your love just like the angels need heaven above
the music continues as we lazaruss blues is all we hear as four guys chase rae through the woods
she is in her shirt and panties wearing football shoulder pads
she is completely wasted
the ground rocks back and forth with each step
trees pass in a slow motion haze
singing well i sure did shot my baby but i did it because she did me wrong
well i sure did shot my baby but i did it because she did me wrong
you know the judge called it murder now the penitentiary is my home
rae grips a tree to steady herself but a team member tackles her
the woods spin and distort as someone mounts her with ease
singing i loved that woman she said she didnt love no one but me
i loved that woman she said she didnt love no one but me
rae smiles as she lifts her hand up to the stars passing the writhing back of the guy on top of her
if she could just grab a star she would feel safe again
she tries to snatch one
her hand drops as the boy stands and takes off after his friends tossing the football
rae lies motionless on the ground
singing yeah but i caught my baby cheating
a tear rolls down lazs cheek
singing now my home aint where it used to be
his guitar groans its last for the night
rae is wasted
she is still wearing her shirt panties and shoulder pads as she steps over passed out teenagers
trips over a sprinkler oh shit
rae doesnt look up
the coricidin is tripping her out
coughing the ground is
turnin upside down
coughing im gonna fall off
gill reaches down and pulls off the shoulder pads
the coughing fit passes
that feels so much better
gills truck flies down the dark road
rae is looking out the window drifting in and out
thought you had a skirt earlier
i got others
gill pulls to the side of the road and kills the engine
he watches rae tilt her head from side to side
this thing you got
ive heard people say youd fuck a tree if it was handy
i can see that
shakes his head but that nigger tehronne
thinks hes some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps
i mean i can see a tree
but that piece of shit
lost in hazy sorrow i begged him
dont see why he had to go
i bet you did
just had to get that black cock up in you
i swear to god
what ronnie sees
you disgust me
gill grabs her legs and spreads them with no resistance
her head rolls from side to side on the truck seat as gill unzips his pants
rae starts giggling
the fuck you laughin at
giggling you dont got half what tehronne got
gill flinches upright
a rage builds in his eyes
from outside the steamed truck window we see gill beat rae repeatedly
muffled from the inside get up
i aint playin
open your silence
he opens the truck door fear in his eyes
rae isnt moving
blood is on her face
a hasty idea
he pushes her out of the truck
she falls to the dark pavement in a tangle of her own limbs
the door slams
gill floors the gas
rae lies motionless alone under the stars
her watch alarm goes off beep beep
ronnie is asleep on the bus unaware that his watch alarm in beeping at him
a guardsman sitting next to him shakes ronnie awake
ronnie silences the alarm
he regards the watch with sadness and affection
the bus roars past
the red brake lights fade into night
lazarus has fallen asleep sitting at his kitchen table
his eyes open
standing is difficult
the guitar falls to the floor
the phone rings
dizziness hits but he manages to pick up the receiver
is on his cell phone
he is placing hymnals in the back racks of the church pews
said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle
you gonna preach bout turnin the other cheek
i think you did alright by god under the circumstances
pauses your people are here for you laz
this is your home
no shame in showing your face
dont know if god wanna see me
he knows where ya at
just answer the door if he come knockin
laz hangs up the phone
lazarus steps out onto his porch
he picks up the trash bags full of roses things and walks down the gravel drive to the road
laz tosses the bags inside his trash cans
hes really hung over this morning
his eyes squeeze shut he grips his neck in pain
his eyes open
they remain fixed beyond us
the pain in his face is replaced with grave confusion
rae lies on the side of the road
her t shirt and panties are damp from the early morning mist her face caked with dried blood
her skin is deathly white her mouth open her eyes shut and swollen
lazarus carefully steps toward her
he leans down over her face
the door slams against the wall as it swings open
laz is carrying rae unconscious and limp in his arms
he lays her down on the couch by the radiator
he pulls a quilt over her cold skin
with a twist of the valve the radiator moans to life
laz takes out his bandana and cleans her face
he tries to wake her
you need to open your eyes for me
could ya do that
her eyes open slightly just slits of white
there we go
there we go
just like you doin
she whispers as she touches her fingers to his cheek
a raspy inhale teh
tehronne done this
a labored breath followed by the most pitiful cough fit
laz tries to calm her as her lungs fight for oxygen
laz looks scared as the coughing stops in a desperate wheeze followed by silence
laz pulls the phone off its cradle on the wall and flips through the phone book
his fingers scan down the listings and stops on police department
he dials and listens
a recorded voice youve reached the fisherville police department
your call will be answered in the order it was received
if this is an emergency please hang up and dial
fingers hit the phone cradle
as soon as he places the phone to his ear he looks over at rae sprawled out on his couch
her bare legs can be seen peeking out from under the quilt
fear hits him
he slams the phone down again
laz crosses to the couch and gently touches her head
softly ima go into town
get you some medicine to fix you up
you just rest okay gal
you just sleep
get that chill outcha
laz touches the radiator
it burns him
lazs ford roars down the shaded street towards town
laz parks his truck in front of macon drugs and heads inside
an old black man named red sits on a bench next to an older white man in his early eighties holding a cane
red is the paid caretaker of melvin
hows the squash this year
its good mister melvin
ill bring ya some
laz rushes inside
the variety of cough medicine confuses laz as he examines them
angela approaches laz
she is dressed in a floral print dress with a white lab coat
angela has a few extra pounds on her but she wears it well with her caring face and sweet manner
gave me a start
its these soft shoes i wear for my back
you hurt it
im standing most of my day
theyre for support
a smile didnt see you in church this mornin
tries to lie been on the crop
may need to get some extra hands if i dont want to work on sundays
its good to see you
angela wants the conversation to continue but laz remains silent
she smiles awkwardly
i need to uh

you can talk to me
my little niece
she got this deep cough
you take her to a doctor
struggles to lie no
no she cant go
mean to say
theys just no money foa doctor
her daddy left for a job and uh
give her to me to look on
a pitiful pause i dont know what to do
angela thinks for a moment
you wait right here
snot and spittle has run down the side of raes face her eyelids stick together as she tries to open them
there is a creak followed by another
rae has become aware that someone is slowly walking up the front porch
the door opens
silhouetted in the days blinding light is a white man in his s
his face is indistinguishable to raes affected gaze
is this a dream
he stands above her and lights a cigarette
the zippo lighter clasps shut
the man lowers it to his side where rae can see it clearly
a bald eagle is printed on the side a sight that makes raes eyes open wide in horror
her breath grows deeper a girlish plea
this is no dream its a nightmare
a massive hand slaps down over her mouth
her crusted eyes peer above the hairy knuckles
he sucks on the cigarette
a red cherry blazes at the end
the man pushes the blanket off of her and grips her panties
raes eyes close
she knows what is next
in his clenched fist the panties are ripped off
rae flinches awake from the fever induced nightmare and falls to the wooden floor drenched in sweat
weakened and shaking she scampers away finally collapsing in the kitchen
her hand reaches out and lands on the strings of lazs guitar on the floor
she grips the steel strings with her trembling fingers
a single bass note twangs as she passes out
angela stands between the aisles motioning laz to approach away from the girl at the counter
is your niece older than
oh she older than that
she hands him a white box with cough syrup inside
my sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia
i just copied her prescription
you dont need to pay anything
just take it
but if she gets worse you give me a call
i wrote my number on the box
this gonna get you in trouble
not if no one finds out
laz doesnt know what to say
he puts the box in his pocket
suddenly awkward oh
she had a card here for her migraine pills
she aint gonna be around no more
so if you
i already tossed that out
takes a step closer somethin you shoulda done to that woman long ago
how she treated you
of course thats none of my business
smiles dont make it less true
angela returns the smile
laz opens his truck door and stops
at the pool hall across the square laz sees a green cutlass with chrome rims
laz enters the empty pool hall
tehronne is playing a game with a skinny playa wanna be dressed in flea market fubu
charlie the owner approaches laz from the bar
we closed up on sunday

calling to the back yo t
laz wanna holla at cha
come on back cuz
charlie nods laz on
he crosses to the back pool table as tehronne sinks the
tehronne looks at his friend
do you call it a game when only one man win each time
i think you call it a damn shame
tehronne hands his friend the pool cue
the two take a few steps away to talk
you need some weed

tries to find the words you know a white girl
dirty blond hair split down the middle like
smiles that aint up to me to hook you up

lazarus looks at him with a furrowed brow
what im tellin you
girl gotta get dick or she go crazy
laz opens his own door with caution
he turns to see rae sprawled in his kitchen in her panties and t shirt
he rushes to her side
rae you hear me
lazarus lifts her sweaty body off the floor and moves her back to the couch
consciousness briefly returns to rae in her feverish haze
the white knuckled hand clutched around her mouth
rae flinches and flails
she falls to the floor
hold on now
raes eyes are open and filled with fear
she struggles to flee as laz holds her in place trying to reassure her
now i aint gonna hurtcha
calm down miss
she fights coughs listen
listen now gal
rae settles in his grip i aint gonna hurt ya hear
gotta get you well
now look me
look me in the eye
rae is too weak to talk or move
laz clutches her small face in his dark hands
open your eyes
you need to see aint no harm here
aint no harm
rae calms my name is lazarus woods
and i aint gonna let you die
raes eyes roll back
lazarus looks terrified as she cranes her head back and forward
her mouth opens
in her sickened state with the force of something evil and deep inside rae clasps her open mouth over lazs
a shriek sounds in his brain as he holds her tighter allowing the kiss to grow in intensity
rae falls to her stomach as laz abruptly stands and stumbles across the room
what he sees chills him to the bone
rae is writhing on the floor as if she is possessed a rant of raspy words pour from her mouth
n nyou fuck
lazarus gets spooked by what he is seeing
he looks to the mantle
his weathered bible lies in a coat of dust
he picks it up as a wave of the burning hits rae
she clutches her breast and crotch rolling from side to side
sudden anger shouting see
see ifi give
rose is shouting at the customers in the cafe
her eyes are white like raes
her voice is not her own but that of rae
screaming laz runs out of his own home not even shutting the door behind him
he gets half way down his drive the bible still clutched in his hand
in a panic laz opens his bible places it down on the drive face up creating a barrier to evil
he hears a choking cough inside the house
rae is fighting for breath beyond the dark door
laz reaches down and picks up his bible
a passage catches his eye
as he reads the fear vanishes from his face
his back straightens
his jaw tightens
he looks back at his house his faith is renewed
the bible is slammed down on top of the toilet tank
the bathtub faucet coughs as laz twists the cold water knob
the freezer door opens
he snatches four trays of ice
the trays crack
the ice cubes bounce into the tub
raes lips are dried and split as she pants lost in dizzying fever
laz lifts her
laz kneels on one knee to put her into the tub
a horrible cry from rae as laz wrestles with her keeping her submerged in the ice cold water
i know child i know
gotta break that fever now
rae sobs struggles dont mean to hurtchu
but i aint lettin you die
holding her down rae is motionless
her eyes are open but blind
her lip trembles
her body shakes from the freezing water
laz rubs the hair from her face gently
he reaches over to the bible on the toilet and opens it to read
put fear of the devil in me gal
got me spooked like is a kid i tell you
flips through the pages but the good lord he showed me what to do
he come knockin like my man r
rae sobs like a child this here matthew
he talkin on how jesus was healin the sick
and a man come up to the disciples and he say
reads deliberately have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and sore vexed
to rae he got the devil in his mind and sores on his skin
reads and he brought the boy to the disciples but they could not cure him
raes shivering is abating
her eyes fight to stay open
laz touches her forehead to test her temperature
reading then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation
how long shall i suffer you
bring the boy hither to me
and jesus rebuked the devil
to rae you hear that
reads then the disciples say
why could not we cast the devil out
and jesus said unto them
raes eyes begin to close
laz gently touches her head to rile her awake
this what he sayin to us
reads if ye have faith
if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto a mountain remove hence
nothin shall be impossible to you
to rae you hear that
you just need a bit of faith
you just gotta believe you gonna get well like i do
he touches her forehead again
her eyes close
you coolin down
laz leans against the wall spent
the cicadas sing in a rising chorus as the clouds above fade from copper to crimson
the faint echo of raes fevered panting
she lies on the couch wrapped in a quilt shivering
her eyes remain closed her face drenched with sweat
laz has cleaned her facial wounds using a few band aids
an explosion ignites the windows surrounding the cabin
rae jolts awake terror pervades her as she gasps at the fire ball outside the window
she struggles to her feet and listens
a faint sound can be heard through the roar of the flames
a whisper ronnie
rae stumbles to the door weak and dizzy
she grips the door knob and pulls the door open
rae races outside tripping down the front porch steps
she looks off at the blaze in the squash field
she frantically races toward the fire the beeping increases
at the center of the blaze is an upside down humvee
to the left of the vehicle a few soldiers bodies lay scattered
raes legs lose all strength she collapses and crawls across the squash plants
a far away voice is heard over the roaring flames
rae crawls across a fallen soldier following the sound of ronnies alarm
she struggles to breathe she almost faints
she finds a soldier face down
with all her strength she turns him over
it is ronnie wide eyed and lifeless
an awful groan comes out of rae crippling sorrow
she pulls on his vest trying to wake him
sobbing nn nn
rae looks up
the flaming humvee is gone
she is not pulling on ronnies vest but the tangled vines of a squash plant
laz stands at a safe distance silhouetted in moonlight
you travelin right now gal
you asleep and you dont even know it
extends his hand now
come on inside with me
rae looks like a terrified child
her eyes well with tears as she shakes her head
laz takes a step toward her
come on gal
she turns and runs away as best she can
laz chases after her
hes much older than her and a bit slower but her balance betrays her
laz wraps his arms around her
rae screams to the sky
and then stillness
rae lies limp in lazs arms unconscious
he reaches down and lifts her wrist to his face
the green screen of the digital watch pulsates with the alarm
he pushes the side button
the beeping stops
laz lays rae back onto his couch
her eyes open into slits
she can see lazs form over her like the man in her nightmare
rae grabs lazs wrist
he flinches with her force
the whisper of a child isokay
struggling with exhaustion rae moves lazs hand to her bare stomach
she rubs it slowly up and down her form suggestively
laz slips his hand away and claps it tight over her eyes
rae holds her breath waiting to be molested her lip quivering
singing deep and soft goin over that hill
goin over that hill
well i aint gonna stop until i reach my gods top
im goin over the hill
well i went to the valley i didnt go to stay
soul got happy i stayed all day
im goin over that hill
rae relaxes and falls into a deep sleep
laz backs away from her a touch of fear in his heart
the voice of tehronne is heard from earlier in the day
she a freak
got what you call a sexual addiction
what im tellin you
girl gotta get dick or she go crazy
lazarus looks at tehronne with a furrowed brow confused
first hooked up with that bitch when she was
girl was fuckin the principal and two of her teachers
you know coach reynolds
he tapped that
go ask him
lazarus opens his barn slicing through the darkness with his flashlight
she been bumpin around all her life hookin up with whoever keep her fed and fucked
he crosses to the other side pulls on a beaded chain turning on the single bulb above his work table
i seen her give it up on park benches back of trucks hoopty hoods you name it
laz opens an old wooden box on his work table
he looks inside
laz looks ill
tehronne checks his pager briefly
you ever seen a train run on a woman
meanin like a team of fellas go to work on her and she dont even break a sweat
puts his pager away she into football you know
you got a letter on your jacket you get that pussy in ya lap
i aint playin
tehronnes friend breaks on the pool table with a sharp crack
lazarus is genuinely disturbed
how a girl get like that
like i told you
lazarus reaches inside the box and pulls out the end of an old chain
girl got a sickness
the chain rattles as laz walks backwards pulling the long chain from the box
the shouting of his brother can be heard
whatchu gonna do
you the end of the chain snags yanking the box over
lazarus is bent over harvesting his tomatoes
singing to himself tell me whos that writin
john the revelator
wrote the book of the seven seals
laz enters his home
he crosses to the kitchen and pours himself a glass of water
dripping with sweat he steps back into the room downing the last of his water
he lowers the glass noticing rae looking at him
rae lifts her head off the pillow
laz comes to her side and helps her sit up
take it easy now
dont rush it
a scratchy whisper how long
how long i been out
you been in and out goin on two
maybe two days
cant believe it two days
after your fever broke youd wake up in spells
long enough to get that medicine in ya
rae sits up on the couch the quilt wrapped around her waist
she looks at the cough syrup bottle on the side table
found you on the side of the road
someone took to beatin on you pretty bad
you know who done that to you
rae touches the cut over her eye
that evening is still a blur
well i dont
rae lifts her head revealing tears in her eyes
she gets mad at herself and wipes them away
i dont got any money
for fixin me up and all
dont need none
then i better be on my way
dont wanna put you out no more
think itd be best if you stayed put while we talk
i gotta be on my way
best try gettin ya wits about you fore you try to
rae struggles for balance as she attempts to stand
the quilt falls away as a heavy chain slides off the couch and thuds on the floor by her feet
rae feels a tug
she looks down to see a dark chain locked around her thin waist and coiled on the floor
the opposite end is locked around the side coil of the radiator
she is chained to the house a prisoner
let me say somethin first
why you got me chained
way i see it its gonna take a while for you to get right
the fuck you been doin to me
i aint laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever
remember like i say i found you in the road
yanks at the chain around her waist get this goddamn thing off me
rae stumbles as she moves away from laz
laz tries to reassure her
now no harms come to you
and i aim to keep it that way

or however you call it
you was runnin wild on me
these fever dreams you was havin
id be chasin you all night

the hell you think you are
interrupting ive saved ya life gal

rae begins to feel a pang of panic
she goes to the chain locked around the radiator
she yanks on it a few times
i give ya enough chain sos you can get about the house
get you to the kitchen
you need the bathroom itll reach
what do you want
we got everything we need
plenty of food
ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it
laz cant answer god saw to it to put you in my path
and i aim to cure ya of your wickedness
this statement terrifies rae
the fear can be seen in her eyes
she backs away the chain scrapes across the floor
you some kinda pervert
some crazy jesus freak gonna fuck the spirit into me
in my house you watch that lip
furious near tears look it mister
you wanna have your way you take it
ill do whatever you want
but you gotta let me go
you cant do this
you cant you sick
you got a sickness
we broke that fever
we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya
rae pushes laz back and bolts for the door
laz falls back against the side table by the couch toppling the lamp
the door slams against the house as rae rushes out in her wolf shirt and panties the chain trailing behind her
screaming laz watches as the coil unravels and snaps taut yanking on the old radiator
the chain whips rae down to the ground
laz watches as dust flies of the radiator with each tug
the fear in lazs face is replaced with a grin as he watches his radiator hold firm
outside rae bucks and screams yanking on the chain like a wild mustang
her bare feet and legs are soiled with fresh mud and grass as she claws at the ground
laz crosses to the radiator and pats it like a proud parent his wedding ring clicks against the iron
to the radiator aint gonna be moved
he steps outside with resolve and strength
he picks up the chain and wraps it around his fist
i aint gonna be moved on this
laz yanks her back dragging her towards him
he grips the taut chain with his other hand and yanks her closer
you can holla yself hoarse
aint gonna bend my will
pulls her closer right or wrong you gonna mind me
pulls her again gonna suffer you like jesus say to the faithless and the perverse rae is spent
she turns to look at her captor as he wrangles her back to the porch
now you get up
and you get in my house
rae spits at laz
rae is screaming and grunting as laz standing in his kitchen tugs on the chain around the door jam like hes drawing water from a well
outside rae struggles to hold onto the porch post
laz pulls hard lifting her lower torso off the ground
whose doin is that
rae loses her grip and slams onto the porch
im comin in
now the pulling stops
rae picks herself up
her knees and hands are scraped and bleeding
the two stare at each other
say we talk
just take a seat on the sofa
ill get us somethin cool to drink
laz crosses to the kitchen
rae sits down on the couch noticing the fallen lamp on the floor
you may not remember
but you spent a whole half day in my tub tryin to cool down
melted four ice trays
he finishes preparing the two waters
he crosses into the front room
rae is not there
rae smashes the lamp on lazs head
the water glasses shatter as laz falls to the floor
rae picks up a wooden chair and breaks it over his back
before she can do any more damage laz grabs her by the wrists and throws her to the couch
rae falls to the floor
laz stumbles on his feet as he clutches his bleeding head
he loses his cool
wicked little bitch
gonna cut me
you gonna get a lot more athat you keep me locked up like this
rae freezes as she sees laz undo his belt buckle
her breath starts to quiver as she deeply inhales and exhales
think im gonna let you do me like that
laz whips his belt off and wraps the buckle around his fist
he stops in his tracks
rae is panting and shaking
her middle finger is scratching at her own thigh
regaining his cool okay now
i aint gonna hitcha
the burning is starting just lost my cool there
he throws the belt away now take that look outcha eye
her anguished hum can be heard through her clenched teeth as she rocks back and forth
her hands wander down to her inner thighs
you stop that foolishness
shaking her head hm mm
on the verge of crying rae gets dizzy
she rests the top of her head on the floor and sways back and forth
laz rushes out the front door
as the wave hits rae twists and turns wrapping the chain around her
she grips the radiator with both hands and rests her face against the side
the wave is about to build in to a powerful climax
rae gasps for breath
the door slams open
laz drenches her with a gallon of cold well water from a tin bucket
rae inhales and freezes
laz waits and watches
the burning is gone
laz kneels next to her and gently frees her bare ankle from the tangled chain
they are both seated on the front porch with paper plates in their laps
laz watches with amusement as rae tears into her chicken and gobbles up the vegetables
i put some back ache into growin them greens
you should slow down and see how they taste
rae remains under lazarus intense gaze as the cicadas sing
rae stares off at orange clouds and purple sky
she takes a step to her left walking through the parallel rows of squash
the chain gently rattles behind her
laz has given her about feet of slack
he holds the chain tight around his fist
rae grins standing proud in her wolf shirt and panties
you like this
walkin me through this field like is your mule
cant sit all day on that sofa
need to get your legs strong
sassy if i break one you gonna shoot me
rae teases laz by adjusting her panties
she turns back to the sunset and stretches
raes smoldering eyes dont leave laz as he chains her to the radiator
laz nervously preaches trying to avoid the sight of her bare legs curled up on his couch
my daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts
thats a group of farmers you know each season theyd rotate the crop
know why its best to rotate em like that
laz moves in close and starts applying antibacterial cream to the cut above raes eye
cuz once in a while soil need a change
corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer
so next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans
that give off a lot of nitrate
change keeps it all growin and growin strong
regarding the eye sting a bit
means ya healin
a nod so all this farmin make me think on matthew
the parable of the sower
man toss seed on rock on the wayside some fell in thorns
you know the story
laz starts putting the cream on her scabbed knees
he rubs them gently
the seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of god
and understand the word of god
not enough for you to hear what im sayin you gotta understand
i get it
whats matthew doin
matthew aint doin shit
this just a story
quelling his frustration look it
ive seen it in nature ive seen it in men
ya got to change up your crop
cuz that seed aint gettin in
rae remains silent ya gotta cut this shit out
got no cause to be up under these fools ruttin on ya like you a bitch
like you somebodys dog
who joins in union with almighty god
in the sanctity of marriage
should degrade herself
and bend to another mans will
rae is aware that laz is somewhere else talking to someone else other than her
there is anger in his tone as he rubs ointment on her bare scabbed knees
shouting my god gal dont you got no sense
i aint sayin i aint weak
playin guitar in the blood bucket jukes all ya life
a nigga learn how to sin let me tell you
grips her by the legs let go of me
rae yanks free of lazs grip recoiling on the couch
laz awakens from his rant
he blinks and stands
a sudden shame overtakes him
he crosses into the kitchen to hide by the sink
he pours rae a glass of water and returns to her side
offering her the glass didnt mean to go off on a tear like i did
i just got to thinkin about things
rae leans up into his face
the glass of water is touching her chest
laz remains hypnotized by her eyes
why is it you old men gotta talk so much
like little boys gotta talk yourself into fuckin me
his knuckles touch her skin we can take our time
i get it
she leans even closer you wanna give me nother bath
laz stands and backs away
he quickly leaves the room
laz looks at himself in the reflection of roses vanity mirror listening to rae stir in the next room
the cicadas are screaming outside
rae is beginning to breathe deep the burning is coming on
under her breath goddammit
she folds her arms over her chest her middle finger scratching her elbow
the anxiety is too much
she rolls over until the chain pulls taut against the radiator
rae has wrapped herself in a tangle of chain
her breathing relaxes
her eyes close
a train rumbles past in the blue hue of dawn
laz pulls his truck next to two other fruit and vegetable vendors archie and gene
archie is an old black man in his early seventies
gene is a short white man closer to lazs age
there goes our fortune
we been doin good for ourselves since you been away
laz sets up his folding table and uncovers his produce
yall know when ella maes open up
you needin to buy some pantyhose
just some dresses
gene looks at archie and shrugs
rae snaps awake
she is wet with sweat from the morning heat
rae drags the chain behind her as she crosses to the front door and looks outside
i dont believe this shit
she folds her arms and looks into the kitchen
there on the table is a covered plate and a small bottle of milk
rae reads a note on top of the plate be back for supper
she pulls off the top plate and finds sausage links eggs biscuits sliced tomatoes and sliced peaches
enough to choke a goddamn horse
she yanks her chain
it rattles across the floor as she sits
laz looks out of place in his faded overalls surrounded by bright colors of ella maes dress shop
ella mae is a wide woman with white hair in her late fifties
im needin some womens clothes
a few dresses
maybe some shoes
but they gotta be nice
they gotta be proper
clothes a woman would want where she could feel and look like a woman without
you know lookin like a tramp or a hussy or somethin
ella mae turns to her assistant rhonda
rhonda is a year old black girl
she turns back to laz unsure how to proceed
do you have a size in mind for what youre lookin for
points to rhonda that young ladys size rightcher
well that makes it easier
rae sits down in the tub still wearing her t shirt and panties
looking up at the shower head above she turns on the cold water and yanks up on the shower knob
cold water sprays down over her
she gasps and then relaxes laying back in the tub
laz is at the counter
rhonda is putting the shoes and clothes in two shopping bags while ella mae rings him up
i hope these will work for your niece
she can always come back in and swap sizes
lazarus points to a small display of fine lotions
mind i ask whats all this business here
these are whipped body creams
its like a lotion
for your hands
some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume
so now they have scented creams
they help moisturize a womans skin
unscrewing a jar this ones my favorite
its called ginger souffle
applying the cream while the skin is still damp
perhaps just after a shower
likes what he smells ill take a jar of that too
rae rattles into the kitchen her damp clothes clinging to her form
she picks up lazs guitar off the table and places it in her lap
she plucks a few random strings out of boredom and smiles
the same apathetic girl is working the front counter as laz enters the drug store with a basket of arranged vegetables
lookin for miss angela
she in the back
laz makes his way to the back of the store
he spies angela in the back pharmacy sorting pills for a pick up
he watches her work for a moment until finally she sees him
wait right there
laz waits as angela rounds the corner
i brung you a little basket of goodies
fresh squash tomatoes some okra butter beans
taking the basket you didnt have to do this
just wanted to say how much i appreciate you helping me the other day
my niece shes cured up and i got you to thank
well thats good
im happy to hear it
there is tension and attraction between the two
i got somethin special for you
angela is flush as laz moves closer than he has ever been before
he reaches in the basket for the jar of cream
this here is a whipped
and its got a smell to it
tell me what you think
laz holds the jar up to her nose
angela closes her eyes and smells
her expression says enough she loves it
they call this ginger souffle
best if it
if it go on your skin just after you been in a hot tub
angela takes the lotion from his hand
she is subtle and demure but the woman is deeply affected
this was very sweet of you
hope you enjoy it
angela watches laz as he walks out the door
the apathetic girl moves up behind angela
laz opens his truck and waves goodbye to old red
melvin is holding a healthy squash
you gonna be on the square later on
got all my honey dos done with
im headin home
its a hot one
laz pulls away in his truck and rounds the corner just as r
crosses the street
he steps over to talk to red
was that laz just left
rae occasionally strums an awful chord as she sings playfully
trying to sing you are my sunshine
my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
youll never know dear how much i love you
please dont take my sunshine away
a voice from outside spins her around
the guitar barks as rae slams it down on the table
rae stays hidden as she peeks out the front window
lincoln is standing before the house holding an old picnic basket
raes middle finger begins scraping against the wall
i come for the butter beans
rae fights her dizziness
she crawls to the radiator as she hears each creak of lincoln crossing to the front door
the zippo with the bald eagle closes
a smoldering cigarette
rae flinches and grits her teeth as lincoln knocks on the door knock knock
aint seen you on the square
mister laz can you hear me
the burning has started deep gasps itching anxiety
worried now mister lazarus
rae watches the shadows of lincolns shoes under the door
they wait patiently and walk away
lincoln walks down the porch steps and stops
rae inches upward pulling herself up the radiator so she can stand
her panting has waned
suddenly the front door swings open
mister laz im comin inside
lincoln cant believe what he sees
rae is chained around the waist damp and barely clothed
her eyes bore into lincoln like an owl zeroing in on a helpless jackrabbit
she rips her shirt off in one tug over her head
lincoln cant move
the picnic basket hits the floor
his mouth hangs open in shock as rae steps towards him and lays her open mouth on the boy
rae shuts the door
laz steers his ford truck up the drive and parks
he takes his time getting out and removing the shopping bags
he opens the door and goes inside
his curses can be heard from outside
lincoln is tossed off the porch clinging to his overalls
tears and fear come to lincoln as laz steps out onto the porch fuming with rage
lincoln backs away expecting a good beating
he starts running up the drive but stops as r
s olds rolls up the drive
lincoln come on back
lincoln darts past laz and runs into the barn clutching his overalls
stops the car halfway down the drive and steps out
was that lincoln james i seen run off
just had a bad fall
whys his britches round his knees
you gonna have to get on
i cant have nobody round my place
starts walking up the drive
you get a call from rose
this aint got nothin to do with that woman
just dont want nobody around me now
somethin wrong with ya phone

stops in his tracks as lazarus pulls out his hunting rifle from the rack behind his seat in his truck
goin dove huntin
you gotta go r
i aint foolin this time
you sayin that guns for me if i dont
spell it out laz
man big enough to pull a gun best have a tongue in his mouth if he aint got a brain in his head
laz is struggling
the rifle feels suddenly strange to him
you aint gonna talk me outta shit no more
i got my mind made up and i aint gonna be moved on this
amused aint gonna be moved
got no place for preachin here
so you do as i say
still stepping closer or what
i told you to turn back
pushes his chest up against the rifle and shouts back
lazs heart is breaking
he is pointing a gun at his only friend
snatches the rifle out of lazs hands
oughta stomp yo ass pointing this at me
unloads the rifle always gotta bring up the preachin
like you just a sheep in my flock and all im good for is poundin on a pulpit

we may not be blood
but we sucked off the same old nurse since the day we was slapped on the ass
and you gonna point a gun at me
a tear rolls down lazs cheek
the shame is unbearable
if you in some trouble than we gonna figure somethin out
you and me
hands him a bandana wipe your face
laz takes the bandana and wipes the tears away
this got anything to do with rose
laz shakes his head then what
the door creaks open
carefully steps inside
rae is sitting on the couch looking out the window
on the verge of tears i didnt want to
rae doesnt respond
quickly steps outside shutting the door behind him
shakes his head as laz follows him off the porch
are you outta ya goddamn mind
man like you ought not take the lords name like you just done
a naked woman chained in ya house
im tellin you the truth dammit
i found her beat

say you out here alone with a beaten half naked white woman loves to fuck
i been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby

laz briefly looks off at the barn knowing lincoln is there
why dont you goon and ask her
she need to talk wit somebody with sense
folks been ruttin and beatin on this gal all her days
and this is how im handling it
go in and talk to her
makin steaks for supper
i expect you to come

you treat folks special when they company
its just supper r
one thing at a time laz
laz walks toward the barn and turns back to r
watch yself in there
that girlll jump on ya junk like a grasshopper
laz opens the door to his barn wide allowing the afternoon light to find lincoln sitting on an old tire weeping
did i hurtchu
lincoln shakes his head
laz carefully sits next to him
what happened in there
that wont your fault
aint a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is
why she got a chain on her
thats between her and me
and i dont want you goin off and tellin ya daddy
in a panic please dont tell my daddy
my mouth is shut boy
and thats how we gonna keep it
dont go braggin to ya buddies ya heard me
laz hands him the bandana r
a bonding smile that your first time

lincoln grins as he wipes the snot from his nose
my first time was with my second cousin behind my uncles barn
she weighed two tons if a pound
coulda done a lot better for myself
you shonuf did
hands rae a glass of water
she is seated on the sofa wrapped in a quilt
sits next to her i gotta ask you
why do you think laz is keepin you chained like this
shrugs at first then you know how like they say you save someones life you responsible for them
guess he just dont think its safe for me
so he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin up bleedin on the side of the road again without a stitch of clothing
yanks on the chain you think hes crazy for thinkin that
rae struggles to answer
something is on her mind
you a preacher
can i ask you a question
nods people always say you gotta get good with jesus if you want not to go to hell
that you say sorry for all you done and
and jesus would let you go on to heaven
you could put it that way
but thats so fuckin stupid
she catches herself im sorry
didnt mean to curse
whats on your mind
you cant hurt people
and then just say im sorry and then everything just gets washed away
why would heaven want people like that
do what they want and then
im gonna tell you somethin and its just gonna be between you and me
rae anxiously nods i think folks carry on about heaven too much
like its some all you can eat buffet up in the clouds
and folks just gonna do as theyre told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates
i can go to shoneys for that
theres sin in my heart
theres evil in this world
but when i got no one
i talk to god
i ask for strength
i ask for forgiveness
not for peace at the end of my days when theres no more life to live and no more good to do but today
rae has never had anyone talk to her like this
she is listening
she is understanding
whats your heaven
what gives you peace
rae looks at her bare feet
she tries to respond but the pain in her chokes back the words
tears come to her
struggling to speak ronnie
a bus stops at the station
the doors swing open
a few passengers exit the bus followed by ronnie
he is not wearing his uniform
he drops his duffle bag and pops a few quarters in the phone
he waits allows the phone to ring
into the phone this is ronnie again

im down at the bus station and
struggles i just need you come get me
you get this message im on the interstate headin downtown toward the square
sadness hits rae

ronnie hangs up the phone
he remains motionless fearful and alone
he picks up his duffle and walks down the interstate
lincoln stands over the barbecue spraying lighter fluid over the coals while r
peels back the corn husks
we gonna eat with her
thats what i was told
she still gonna have that chain on
im working on that
trying to change the subject so
whats goin on in your life lincoln
i aint no virgin no more
lincoln tosses a match on the coals
they ignite with flame
laz is humming to himself as he finishes chopping up the potatoes
he wipes his hands and catches rae standing behind him
she looks classic in the floral sundress
she folds her arms feeling awkward under lazs approving gaze
now thats sharp

rae peeks at the others with their eyes closed tight
she follows their example
we ask that you bless this meal put before us
may the food nourish our bodies and this fellowship nourish our spirit
in jesus name we pray
there is a sudden flurry of activity at the table as the four begin piling up their plates
pass them potatoes lincoln

this all looks wonderful
i skipped lunch
well dig in son

raes eyes are fixed on r
as he picks up a devilled egg
she looks over at laz who is aware of her anxiety
he gives her a wink
bites into the egg and moans with delight
to laz mm
now these eggs got some kick to it
whatchu got in this
motions to rae ask the chef
everyone looks at rae surprised
she feels a sudden rush of fear as she struggles to answer r
ronnie is walking by the bar along the interstate
he stops when he sees gills truck
ronnie adjusts his duffle bag over his shoulder as he enters the mid sized bar
gill is seated at the bar
he turns to ronnie along with a few other locals one being herman age
surprised holy shit

ronnie sits next to gill
herman leans in wanting to be a part of the conversation

ronnie glares at herman as he moves to the other side of the bar
gill moves closer to ronnie to get the whole story

gill doesnt know what to say next
i cant get rae on the phone

youd tell me if you knew somethin right

you need a ride
gills truck rounds the bend and up the gravel drive leading up to ronnies trailer
the headlights scan across the porch as gill parks
ronnie is the first through the door calling out for rae before he can turn on the lights
he sees that the trailer is the same as it was the day he picked up ronnie nothing is different
this dont feel right
kitchen looks just like i left it
i know cuz i cleaned it
she ever tell you she was thinkin of taking off
i just been so mixed up lately gill
and you know with her history i can see how she could get scared
tears and run
gill is disturbed by ronnies sudden flood of emotion and tears
he crosses to the pantry already knowing which cupboard to pull the liquor out of
he pours two drinks
he hands one to ronnie
come on drink some
ronnie manages a few swallows
her momma works down at the grocery down on the square
maybe she seen her
gill stands over ronnie looking down on his pitiful face
you cant see cuz youre too close to it
ronnie waits these nervous spells you get
you never had that shit back in school
thats not right really cuz i
continuing you joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself
armyd pay for school
you were gonna get a degree maybe somethin in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin of yourself
his words are painful to ronnie
gill doesnt hold back
and then you had to fall in love with the school slut
continuing with all she was doin
with all the shit she kept doing
you stayed stuck to that bitchs ass and you wouldnt let go
i know about how she was like
but we was different
is the only person she talked to about it
how shes abused
terrible things gill just terrible
rage suddenly fills gill
he grabs ronnie and throws him against the wall
its not her fault gill
shes had to take care of me all this time cuz id just start throwin up
just losin my grip
and she listened
she listened to me
gill releases ronnie and walks away and
i got better
i dont get nervous like i used to
and since we been together
she been faithful to me
put all that junk behind her
the only thing that cunts had behind her is me and half the town fuckin her
ronnie cant believe it your first night away i come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to
you werent gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her
like she was havin some kinda fit
ronnie cant respond
tears roll down his face
gill holds up the whiskey bottle
pours a drink dont you think its funny how i know where everything in your house is
moves in close i dont care if that hurts you or not
truth is i dont know who you are anymore
so fuck it
gill turns away
ronnie grips gill around the neck from behind
he bends him back painfully and throws his head up against the wall
the front door burst open as gill goes flying down the front porch
ronnie cocks a
and shoves it into his belt
ronnie pins gills elbow behind his back and retrieves the keys from his front pocket
you gonna steal my truck
make yourself at home
you done it already
gill watches ronnie tear down the drive in his own truck
laz and r
laz smiles as he watches lincoln and rae through the kitchen window as they wash dishes and talk about football
gotta get that chain off her laz
somethin like this gets out you could land in a heap of trouble
im dealin with what god put before me
you believe he wants this
a woman chained to ya radiator
not like that
shes tied to me r
we tied to each other
laz is silent
i cant leave unless i get your word
laz looks down at his shoes
i got some news you need to hear
its about rose and your brother
this is not easy for shes pregnant
she gonna have a baby
silence her sister told my wife
you know how them sewing circles go
just a matter of time till you got word
thought thats why you been keepin to yourself out here
laz conceals his pain i dont know how much of this is to make her happy or to hurt you
but it is what it is
laz struggles with his emotions
he turns to r
stone faced and cold
im through with them both
laz and rae wave to lincoln as he climbs into r
they pull away up the drive and disappear into the night
the cicadas sing as the two stand in silence rae at peace feeling genuine contentment while laz looks lost in silent pain
they sure liked them devilled eggs
you drink whiskey
a bottle of whiskey is removed from a top cabinet above the refrigerator
two small glasses each get a healthy swallow
you take it straight
he hands her a glass
laz then looks at his as if he struggles with a decision
holding up the glass to my baby brother
gonna be a daddy
rae nods and downs the whiskey with lazarus
well thats good news
so youre gonna be someones uncle
laz pours another swig for himself and downs it
we drinkin buddies now
pours two more glass to freedom
laz pounds back his third shot
still makin jokes
pulls out his keys no joke
laz pulls rae closer to him by the chain wrapped around her waist
he opens the old lock with a key
not my place to change your mind or anybody elses
people gonna do how they please
you only get one life
should be lived the way you wanna live it
the chain falls to the floor with a hollow thud
rae looks confused
if you want
i can take you back to town now
i aint in a hurry
the two stare at each other in silence
could you do somethin for me
rae watches with intense curiosity as laz tunes his guitar sitting at the table
takes another drink aint played fore nobody in years
laz slides his calloused fingers across the strings spurring the old guitar into an impressive wail
rae grips the chair
plays as he remembers funny how a sound just speak to ya heart
a haunting slide guitar riff barks
rae has a physical reaction to the music
she is fascinated and fearful
thinks wanted me some kids
a whole mess of em
but rose my wife
chilren was for another time
takes a drink theys this one spring
i saw a change in her
her breasts start swellin up
come a few mornings i hear her heavin in the bathroom
i seen it with women before
laz thinks for a moment
come a day rose say she had to go visit her folks in jackson
didnt want me to come
so i stayed put
remembers when she come back
hesitates they talk about a woman havin that glow
couldnt see it no more
took it away
cut it out
the guitars song turns dark
laz slides his fingers up the guitar strings lingering on low growns
while she sleepin
held a pillow in my hands
i could see myself killin her
what evil in my heart make me wanna kill her i dont know
its that voice in me
each time i think its gone he come howlin back
devil or no i dont know
but i am a haunted man
fear spreads across raes face
laz is talking about something all too familiar
calls me when im ailing
when i cant find my home lost in the pines
i calls it the black snake moan
he closes his eyes and sings mm mm
got no momma now
got no momma now
its over late last night dont need no momma now
he sways back and forth with his eyes closed
rae hears the swell of the cicadas
her eyes dart to the front door as the familiar creek of footsteps are heard
kneels next to him in fear please keep singin
the door swings open
a white calloused hand appears around raes mouth
she gasps in terror clutching lazs leg
the white hand is gone
tears come to her
she trembles as laz sings
singing mm mm
black snake crawlin in my room
black snake crawlin in my room
some pretty momma better come and get this black snake soon
rae rests her head against his knee
singing black snake is evil black snake is all i see
black snake is evil black snake is all i see
woke up this mornin black snake moved in on me
laz concludes the song
rae raises up to her knees facing laz
tears have run down his dried face
he opens his eyes
my life is gone
only life i was livin
and i lost it
im here with you
i had love in my heart
and i gave it to one woman
and she gone now
his lip quivers where am i gonna put all this love
rae gently touches his cheek
the wind picks up outside
you can give it to me
rae kisses laz
he is motionless at first allowing it to happen
his hand moves from the neck of his guitar to the bend in her neck
the passion intensifies as they squeeze the guitar between them
laz pulls his lips away and holds her head in his hands
they are so close they are breathing into each others mouths
you cant start this and not finish
not with me
kisses him please
the guitar clangs to the floor as laz lifts rae in his arms
they kiss ravenous for each other
he knocks up against the side table causing his bible to fall to the floor face up and open
the wind pushes the front door open slamming it hard against the wall
they turn together kissing laz slowly spinning with rae in his arms
but laz is soon distracted by the pages of his bible fluttering on the floor
the wind is blowing the pages turning them with an unseen hand
i gotta stop
raes kisses get more aggressive rae stop
she cant hear the burning has her dammit rae
it takes a considerable effort to pull rae away
she falls to the floor dizzy and sucking in air
this aint the way for me
rae is struggling for breath
she desperately grabs at laz
not gonna lie to you laz
labored breath this ones a doozy
i dont think
i dont think i can stop this
her eyes roll back briefly almost losing consciousness
laz catches her and holds her tightly
tell me what to do
barely able to speak the
laz grips the chain and wraps it around rae
as the burning increases
laz holds rae tight across his lap his back up against the radiator
i seen a man die
he couldnt breathe
his heart was
was givin out
you just havin a fit
you aint goin nowhere
he told me
i just stood there and watched him
i watched him die laz
her legs itch like they are covered in ants
the wave is hitting her hard
laz holds her face up to him
like a little girl oh laz
he hurt me
hurt me so many times
no ones gonna hurt you no more
you think god forgives people like that
crying like a child you think god forgives people like me
suddenly aware of the rising burn rae grits her teeth
rae turns away as laz holds her head in his lap
she bites down on his middle finger as his hand moves over her mouth
she is gasping screaming into his hand
laz holds her
raes open mouth quivers as the sensation peaks
her shoulders slump her chest vibrates
she is crying softly
well just stay here
wait till it passes
the pages of the bible flip to the final pages in the wind
lazs truck pulls into his usual spot on the square
rae is riding shotgun
where you gonna be
be here all afternoon
waits you ready for this
im gonna just get some girl stuff like make up and
rae looks out the window a touch of fear
this town aint goin nowhere
you take the time you need
they both step out of the truck
gene and archie watch raes ass as she walks by
they then look back at laz incredulous
friend of mine
rae enters the modest grocery store holding herself tight
a few harmless shoppers look at her making her feel even more uncomfortable
laz is selling vegetables to a young woman
he is unaware that angela has moved up behind him grinning carrying a small basket
i bet you have loyal customers
turns and grins you liked what i brung ya
been eatin like a princess all week
even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo
thatd be nice
i put on the lotion you got me
can you smell it
angela steps forward and pulls away her hair from her neck
she cranes offering her neck for laz to smell
smells thats nice too
rae is looking at herself in the provided makeup counter mirror
she looks at the compact in her hand and decides against the purchase
she rounds the corner and stops
she sees sandy on her knees in the center of the aisle building a display of tuna cans
rae thinks to leave but stops
she makes a decision to talk to her
she walks up the aisle and stands above her mother
rae kneels down next to her
shes trying to make a connection
what happened to your face
got in a little accident
not believing her yeah
sandy stands and wipes her brow
since you workin on the square now maybe we could get some coffee in the morning if you want
you need money again
thats not why
a frustrated breath why we always gotta do this
i mean you and me been at each other as far back as i can remember
wasnt no love between us
and im your daughter
im the only family you got
you never needed nobody
always made that clear to me
i know i did
struggles with tears im tryin to be difrent
im tryin to
get some peace you know
im workin here rae

rae starts walking away
she quickly turns
i just think you shoulda kept him off me thats all
the hell are you talkin about
dont do that
ill go along with all you say about me
you cant pretend no more on that
cuz i was just a kid momma
a terrible silence i didnt know about any of that stuff he was doin to me
tears well up and you let him do it
some big nobody in your life
and you let him do as he wanted
with the only somebody you had
it is clear from sandys reserved anguish that rae is telling the truth
sandy firmly grips her by the arm and walks her out
rae winces in pain like a toddler being led off to a car for a good whipping
i didnt mean to shout
all my life i been puttin out your fires with you givin out your snatch to every waggin dick in this town
and you gonna lay the blame at my feet
well i aint gonna take that
just tell me
not gonna be mad
we can just talk about it
be eye to eye on this
you dont even got to say youre sorry
just say how you knew
only thing im sorry for is listenin to my parents and having you instead of doin what i shoulda done
sandy walks back up the aisle returning to her canned tuna
and then the rage hits rae
with each breath rae grits her teeth tighter
she grabs a mop off the side aisle and turns around
sandy is pricing cans down on her knees
she doesnt see rae coming
tell me you dont know
goddamn rae clocks her over the head sending sandy into the display of cans
rae hits her again with the mop
she is screaming in short anguished breaths
rae grabs everything she can and dumps them onto sandy bags of flour cans entire shelves of ketchup
mark comes running to the aisle followed by two other employees
stunned customers watch in amazement
what are you doin
hysterically screaming and thrashing the mop laz and angela are seated next to each other under the gazebo
is thinkin about singing in the choir
i dont know if i got a good voice or not but
practice is only on mondays and wednesdays so
grinning you gonna sing me somethin
come on just a little somethin
goon now dont be shy
she looks around and then leans in close to laz
she sings softly sweetly with all her soul
singing there is a balm in gilead to make the wounded whole
laz is falling in love
she is so beautiful to him he doesnt see the people running to the front of the grocery store
singing there is a balm in gilead to save my sick sick soul
opens her eyes speaks so
you think i should be in the choir
laz is grinning from ear to ear
he is about to speak but the commotion outside the grocery catches his attention
his smile fades
what is it
laz bolts toward the grocery as fast as he can
laz rushes past the gawking customers at the end of the aisle
a few male workers including mark stand at a distance watching rae weep on the floor
sandy is being helped up by a co worker her head is bleeding
rae rocks back and forth her face spotted with flour dust the mop held tightly in her grip
mark tries to step closer but rae cries out thrashing with the mop handle
rae lifts her eyes
the chain pulling around raes waist
the radiator clanking as it is pulled
lazs hand holding her head to him as she cries
laz slowly crosses to rae
she lifts her tear soaked eyes to him
he kneels next to her
ill take you home now
he lifts her up in his arms
she sobs into his chest as he carries her through the onlookers
angela is there
she looks confused and shocked
this your cousin
laz cant lie anymore
his gaze falls to the floor
he leaves the store without saying anything to angela
ronnie has parked gills truck on the square
he starts walking up to the grocery store
he sees laz carrying rae in his arms
she is sobbing into his chest blind to all around her
ronnie freezes in shock as laz approaches
ronnie is unable to move goddammit kid get outta my way
laz pushes ronnie causing him to fall backwards on to the pavement
ronnie watches laz put rae in his truck and drive away
a wave of nausea hits
he turns over and heaves
the wooden chimes are deathly still above the porch
the evening cicadas have begun their chorus
rae is holding her knees to her chest in the tub
laz sits next to her dipping the sponge in the water gently washing her back and shoulders
laz moves her head back into the palm of his hand to wash her hair
she stares into his eyes as he squeezes the sponge on her forehead
you took care of your wife like you do me
rae is wrapped in the quilt laying on the couch
she is awake and motionless helpless to her depression
laz sits on the side of his bed
something is on his mind
we cut to him on his stomach searching for something under his bed
another old guitar case comes out followed by another then another
finally laz stands an old maroon case in his grip
he opens the latches on the side and lifts the thin lid revealing a gorgeous cream colored electric guitar
rae has not fallen asleep yet
she turns to see laz entering the dark room with the maroon guitar case
you and me we night owls
no use fightin this shit
tosses her a dress get up
lazs truck groans as it bounces into the crowded parking lot of bojos
rae steps out looking beautiful in her sun dress
laz slams the door to his truck guitar case in hand
they begin walking inside
raes watch goes off
she quickly turns it off
but a faint echo of the alarm can be heard behind her
she stops and turns toward the truck
the sound is gone
what is it
they go inside
ronnies hand appears from under the blue tarp in the back of lazs truck
he pulls himself out and looks around
laz and rae stand like strangers by the door
the place is wall to wall people at the bar people playing pool
laz sees the culprit of this show
is gabbing with bojo a beer in his hand
getchu at that table up yonder
you can handle it
as rae makes her way through the crowd of people laz marches over to r
the hell is this shit
i called bojo like you say
called up the fellas in the band
the fuck are all these people doin here
been drinkin in this shit hole for years aint seen this many people since i dont know
hey kiss my ass laz

bojo turns away to another customer
grins as he removes a flask
he offers it to laz
laz snaps it away
there you go preacher man

i just know how you get
good to know them butterflies still in ya gut
laz and r
look over at rae seated alone at a small table near the stage
heard about this morning
we aint here to talk about that shit
laz surprises r
by walking away and up onto the stage
rae watches as laz shakes hands with some of the band members
a few whistles from the crowd
laz sits down at a chair off to the right of a short mic stand
he plugs in
rae watches curiously as laz tunes his guitar moans of electric distortion
sits next to her
you in for it now
he gonna nail it to the wall tonight
i done pissed him off
the drummer kicks in
laz tears into the strings
the entire place begins to undulate and bounce as laz returns to the blues
singing i dont know but i been around tell me them women shake em on down
rae watches in awe
shes never seen anything like it
she is surrounded by couples dancing so close they might as well be naked
but there is also a great sense of safety as laz controls the room with his music
singing yes im goin georgia line
see if them women sweet like mine
hershel a black man in his s asks rae to dance
you wanna cut it up baby
rae looks up at laz
laz smiles and nods
rae takes the mans hand and moves out onto the dance floor
cant be seated anymore
he stands and stomps his foot
shouting at laz yeah you know you home old man
you just walked through the door
singing i dont know but i been told them georgia women sweet jelly roll
rae allows lazs voice and guitar to take hold of her
her face gets wet with sweat as she moves making love to the current in the air
men are dancing all around her but now she is in control
she turns to a young man and shakes then an old man
she is free herself and above all safe
laz smiles unaware of ronnie watching from the window behind him
there is rage and confusion in his face as he watches rae surrounded by dancing limbs
both laz and rae are drinking water from the sink in tall glasses like theyve been stranded in a desert
are you drunk
laz shrugs keep drinkin water and you wont get a headache in the mornin
yeah gal i been here before
smiling i guess you have
laz is taking off his shoes getting ready to crash for the night
he sits down on the side of his bed and takes off his shirt leaving his t shirt on
rae is standing in his doorway
can i sleep with you tonight
dont think thatd be wise
i didnt mean it nothin dirty
i know you didnt
but you a grown girl
you can handle it
i got to
she crosses to laz and kisses him on the cheek
rae then walks down the hall to her couch in the front room
laz turns off the light
rae enters the dark bathroom and shuts the door behind her
her hair is shorter a shaggy bob bleached platinum blond
arty always behind the door attempts to enter but rae pushes the door closed and locks it
baby where you goin
im gonna pee
i gotta take a break and go pee
now this isnt fair
you said i could do it too
eat shit and die arty
a girl can change her fuckin mind
rae finds the light switch
she yelps upon seeing ronnie crouched by the tub
suddenly feeling violated rae yanks down on her shirt to hide the fact that shes not wearing anything else
you dont gotta get up but
i gotta go
ronnie attempts to get up but its too late rae has already squatted on the commode pinning ronnie between her and the bathtub
rae is breathing heavy her focus is scattered
shes coming up or coming down from a big burn
waiting for pee i think if i just piss
ill be okay
you feelin sick
im just in one of my moods
you know how i get
yeah i know
ronnie tries to look away trying to make an awkward moment less awkward
raes anxiety is hitting her
i think itd be better if you talk to me
just about anything you know
it can be funny or
just tell me somethin
ronnie nervously considers this before agreeing to open his mouth
he points into the tub
thats my vomit
i came in here to get sick
i thought id make the toilet but
anyway i got sick
are you wasted
i just got a messed up stomach
remembering holy shit
holy shit ronnie
smacks him on the arm youre a fuckin rock star
im a what
all them people shoutin your name like they were doing tonight
that arm you gotll getchu on a box of cereal
ronnie leans over and dry heaves into the tub
it is painful
rae leans forward and touches his back comforting him
you okay ronnie
ronnie falls back gripping his stomach there are tears in his eyes from the dry heaving
suddenly emotion hits him
through tears and clenched teeth box of cereal
looks at his trembling fists everybody keeps sayin things to me take make me feel great
but i dont feel great at all
i feel like im comin outta my skin
like im losin control of my mind
looks into raes eyes im not like this
im not usually so
really starts crying i dont know whats
rae pulls ronnie to her
he cries into her shoulder
she gently rubs his wet face and sings her words of comfort
ronnie begins to calm down
the sobbing abates
the metal music from the party outside is muffled through the door
the two hold onto each other in silence
they both giggle a welcome release of tension
i feel better
yeah i do
ronnie lifts his head from sleep his memory of rae has vanished
he is leaning against the corner of the barn his
in his grip
his gaze slowly turns toward lazs darkened house
his hand begins to shake
a crow squawks in the rows of corn
a bright morning is coming
laz is still asleep
the sound of clumsy guitar playing accompanied by a tiny voice can be heard
plucking trying to find the right note you
laz opens his eyes
laz quietly creeps into the doorway to watch rae struggle with the guitar playing
he could stay there for hours watching this little girl play his guitar
rae looks up and sees laz
she stops playing
looks like you know a song
dont know where i learnt it but
its there in my head
laz sits next to her and takes the guitar from her
playing a tune how you feelin today
you know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover
like your eyes can open a little bit more
i know that
woke up real early
sun was shining
just thought id mess around try to learn a song
goon and sing it ill play
no you do it
i cant sing
stop that foolishness
just do as i say and close your eyes
rae closes her eyes close your eyes
and think about
well for a song like this id say you think about what you love
what i love

raes playful smile turns serious
laz continues playing
think on that
and sing wit me
laz comes in singing you are my sunshine
my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
youll never know dear how much i love you
please dont take my sunshine away
rae opens her eyes with a delightful giggle
laz continues playing
i know another
it go like this
sings last night dear as i lay sleeping
i dreamed i held you in my arms
when i awoke dear i was mistaken
so i hung my head and i cried
to rae close your eyes rae
rae doesnt hesitate to obey
with her eyes closed and laz playing neither can see ronnie creeping up from the kitchen with his gun
singing you are my sunshine
my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
ronnie looks sick with pain as he points the barrel at the back of lazs head
singing youll never know dear how much i love you
please dont take your sunshine away
opens her eyes laz spins around knocking away ronnies arm
the gun fires into the wall
the guitar cracks on the floor
laz lunges at ronnie but ronnie is faster
he spins laz around and slams him to the floor pushing his gun into lazs face
ronnie looks up at rae his eyes red with sorrow and rage
he pushes the gun to the side of lazs head

ronnie grips the shaking gun
a severe attack is on the rise as he listens to laz
aint that easy is it

first theres that loud crack
always louder than you think
like it just come up a cloud and clapped a mess thunder right in ya hand
he tries to control his breathing
smell of smoke
taste of my blood and brains in your mouth stingin ya eyes
ronnie almost vomits but he holds it back
just let me
rae moves closer to him wanting to comfort him but she stops as ronnie points the gun at her
his eyes pleading for her to stay back
ronnie obeys you need to kill a man all you gotta have is a good reason
watches ronnie fight his attack you know she been here with me dont cha
been all over town givin up that switch you thought was your own
put all your love and dreams into one woman
she turn around and give it all to another man
thats a good reason to paint the wall with me kid

cuz there wont be no more question in her mind

a real killer
a flood of tears are streaming down ronnies face
the gun is shaking furiously in his hand
dont say that to me
getting fed up son im grown
dont got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk
im too old to play house
looks at rae and then back at ronnie and cowboys
so lets have it
end me or get out of my face
ronnie looks like a scared five year old having an asthma attack
laz barks at him one last time
silence the last shout from laz completely destroys ronnie
his shoulders slump
the gun lowers in his grasp
a low sob is heard as he falls to his knees
laz snatches the gun from his hand and stands
rae inches closer to ronnie as he kneels over and weeps
she gently touches his shoulder
he turns his anguished face to her and tries to speak
i cant stop
i cant stop
what am i gonna do
ronnie hides his face in his hands
rae throws her arms around him and holds him tight
i got you baby
i got you
laz removes the clip and crosses to the kitchen
he slams the gun on the sink opens a drawer and removes the wall phone
seeing laz plug the phone in what are you doing
laz dials a number you gonna call the cops
you think they gonna help this
they ever help you laz
laz listens on the phone laz looks at rae
there is hurt in his eyes
thought you knew me better gal
into the phone i need you at my house
crosses from the kitchen
he hands a glass of water to rae seated on the couch
he hands another to ronnie seated next to her
sits before them as laz lingers in the doorway
to ronnie i imagine theres a lot of good between you two
but i want you to tell me whats bad
and dont hold back
ronnie is very uncomfortable
he looks at rae seated next to him and then back at r
i hate this town
you cant round the corner without bumping into someone whos got your number
a brief look at rae we did a lot of dreamin me and rae
makin plans to get out
id do my tour and
wed move outta here
go to chattanooga
and id work for my uncle
looks down tears come to ronnie but
when rae gets like she does
and she does the things that she always done
makes me feel like she loves this place moren me
rae starts shaking her head tears come to her eyes
raises a hand to silence her
go on ronnie
all my life people called me shit like sissy and
i got few things in my life that make me feel like
like a man
i mean thats it
i wanna feel like a man with her
i wanna feel like the only man with her
ronnie wipes the tears from his eyes with his shirt sleeve
turns to rae
looks at rae now rae were not here to fix you or judge you
only you and the almighty can do that
but i want you to tell me about these spells you get
rae takes a deep breath
she looks up at laz
he encourages her with a nod
it starts like this
starts in my head
then moves to my stomach
then it goes lower
i can stop it sometimes but mostly i just jump on and ride it out
then everythingll go back to normal you know
only thing ever took that feeling away was
when i met ronnie
the emotion really hits hard cuz i love him so much
hes all i got in my life thats special
and i like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous
when i can do that for him
its like im givin somethin of myself that i havent givin nobody else
rae look at ronnie
and tell him how you feel
rae turns to ronnie
her nose is running as she wipes away her tears
i think were fucked up
both of us
i know i am
that dont mean what i feel aint true
it dont mean i cant love
and i know how i been is
so if you want to quit on me
ronnie is very moved by raes plea
he touches her face and wipes away a tear

the door opens
angela looks surprised to see laz
she is dressed in jeans a t shirt wearing rubber gloves from cleaning
you wasnt atcha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address
hope you dont mind me comin over
what do you need

angela notices rae and ronnie seated in lazs truck
more cough syrup

angela takes a breath and opens the door wider
it is a small house but tidy
angela motions for laz to sit
i lied to you
it was wrong
but at the time
i didnt know what to do
imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal is carryin
you dont need to explain yourself to me

long pause i got feelings for you
and i didnt want you to think

angela thinks on this
she rises out of her seat and crosses to laz sitting next to him on the love seat
im gonna put my trust in you
im gonna do it knowin all too well i can get hurt like this
and i have been hurt
just like you
beat woman like me i got a lot of livin to do
but my days are precious to me

you understanding me laz
they stay locked in each others sight
then the slowest most gentle kiss happens between them
when they separate laz is lost in her eyes
now whatchu need me to do
cuz im gonna go do it
laz enters the pool hall and spots tehronne
tehronne motions him back
next to tehronne is an old black man named pinetop
yo this here pinetop
i think he got what you lookin for
pinetop grins and produces a black velvet cloth
he opens it gently and spreads it out revealing a long thin gold chain
laz nods approvingly
tehronne leads laz down the back steps
they both round the corner revealing an old chevy caprice
it is light brown except for one door that is gray however the chrome rims on the car are impressive worth more that the entire car by a long shot
it got some miles on it but my boys say she run good
got fresh s on her
aint my doin
thats just how it came to me
nobody gonna come lookin for it
i got the pinks
got no problem
hands laz the keys aint gonna have my girl ridin no bus
moved impressed dont see generosity much these days
everything always got a catch
guess im tryin to say
nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people
and you know what
im good at it
naw what i mean
tehronne walks back into the pool hall leaving laz alone
rhonda has three white dresses over her arm as she hurries past ronnie seated next to the back dressing rooms
the door doesnt close all the way
he stands and moves in for a peek
angela pokes her head out and grins
what are you doing
shrugs just wanted to see
you know the rules
vacant look from ronnie you do know the rules dont you
yeah i know
then start taking them seriously
rae is standing in bra and panties up on a small platform in front of a tri divided mirror
ella mae takes the dresses from rhonda
angela sees that rae is nervous
its okay to breathe honey
ronnie is wearing a brown corduroy jacket
he is attempting to tie his neck tie in the side mirror of lazs truck
lincoln also wearing his sunday best steps up behind him
guess im gonna be your best man
ultimately accepting okay
you havin trouble with that tie
cuz im pretty good at it
lincoln steps behind him to tie the tie
gotta do it like this or i get all turned around
laz is wearing the same suit he wore at the cafe with rose
he is seated in ronnies trailer outside the back bedroom door
angela steps out from the bedroom with a grin
shes ready for you
laz opens the door carefully looking around the doorjam
he sees her standing before the dresser mirror
she looks beautiful simple and elegant
rae desperately searches lazs eyes for approval
now thats sharp
thats real sharp
miss ella mae set you up didnt she
you like it
ive had nice things before but i always ruined em somehow
well this ones yours now
you ready to take care of it
rae bows her head
she fights back tears
i want to
laz holds her face in his hands
he speaks softly
lets stop that
smiles you and me
we can handle this
you hear me gal
we gonna be just fine
now live ya life
pull your shit together and live your life
his words are piercing and true
rae nods decides
s words are heard as rae wraps her arms around laz and rests her head on his chest
i dont want you to let go
maybe i wont
when i was a child i talked like a child
i thought like a child i reasoned like a child
ronnie turns toward the trailer
he is in his suit standing in his front yard lincoln at his side
stands to the side with a bible in his hands
when i became a man i put childish ways behind me
ronnie is amazed with what he sees
laz leads beautiful rae down the steps as angela tends to her side
now we see but a poor reflection as in the mirror then we shall see face to face
i know in part then i shall know fully even as i am fully known
rae holds firm to lazs arm as they come together on the green grass to witness and perform this union
and now these three remain faith hope and love
but the greatest of these is love
looks to laz who gives this girl in marriage
lazarus takes a few steps with rae offering her arm to ronnie
ronnie and laz stay locked in each others gaze
you got her now
laz stands next to angela as ronnie and rae face r
i want you to look at each other and listen to me carefully
do you understand
they both obey each with a serious expression
i require and charge you both as you stand in the presence of god to remember that love and loyalty alone will avail as a foundation of a happy and
to lincoln go on hand it to him
lincoln steps toward ronnie and holds up the black velvet
ronnie takes the gold chain and carefully wraps it around raes waist
no human ties are more tender
no vows more sacred than those you now assume
laz looks on a conflicted emotion of joy and loss
if these solemn vows be kept inviolate the home which you are establishing will abide in peace and your life will be filled with joy
angela reaches over and takes lazs hand in hers
ronnie is at the wheel of the chevy caprice
rae sits silently next to him
rae looks out the window as a huge wheeler rolls up on her side
she tries to ignore it and the tension it brings
she turns to see that ronnie is sweating
another truck is on his side sandwiching them in
an attack is coming over ronnie
his breath is short
his chest tightens
rae reaches over and gently strokes the back of his neck
i gotta pull over
the two trucks zoom ahead as ronnie breaks to the side
dust flies as the chevy skids to a stop on the side of the road
trucks zip by shaking the car as ronnie tries to get control of his breathing
rae tries to stay calm stroking the back of his neck as he struggles for breath
he puts his forehead against the wheel to stave off the building nausea
through clenched teeth fear comes to raes face as she notices her middle finger scratching at the back of ronnies neck
she pulls it away and shoves her hand between her thighs
her eyes close as the burning builds
she grips the gold chain around her waist
the chain tight around rae as she struggles
rae panting and sweating on lazs floor
she reaches out
her hand lands on the strings of his guitar
a single string is plucked
rae opens her eyes the low note still sounding in her head
she places her hand back on his neck
and then soft as a prayer singing you are my sunshine
my only sunshine
you make me happy when times are gray
ronnie slowly turns and looks at rae his head still resting on the steering wheel
the panting has slowed
color starts returning to his cheeks
singing youll never know dear how much i love you
please dont take my sunshine away
the anxiety is gone
ronnie takes a breath and looks at rae humbled and thankful of her power to soothe him
rae is smiling
