misery by william goldman b
b if window
href b b by william goldman based on the novel by stephen king a single cigarette
a hotel ice bucket that holds a bottle of champagne
the cigarette is unlit
the match is of the kitchen variety
the champagne unopened is dom perignon
there is only one sound at first a strong wind now another sound sharper a sudden burst of typing as we paul sheldon typing at a table in his hotel
its really a cabin thats part of a lodge
not an ornate place
he is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous mountains
the sky is grey
snow is scattered along the ground
were out west somewhere
the wind grows stronger there could be a storm
paul pays no attention to whats going on outside as he continues to type
hes the hero of what follows
forty two hes got a good face one with a certain mileage to it
we are not in other words looking at a virgin
hes been a novelist for eighteen years and for half that time the most recent half a remarkably successful one
he pauses for a moment intently as if trying to stare a hole in the paper
now his fingers fly and theres another burst of typing
he studies what hes written then the paper as he rolls it out of the machine puts it on the table prints in almost childlike letters these words a pile
of manuscript at the rear of the table
he puts this last page on gets it straight and in order hoists it up folds it to his chest the entire manuscript hundreds of pages
paul as he holds his book to him
he is just for a brief moment moved
a suitcase across the room
paul goes to it opens it and pulls something out from inside a battered red leather briefcase
now he takes his manuscript carefully opens the briefcase gently puts the manuscript inside
he closes it and the way he handles it he might almost be handling a child
now he crosses over opens the champagne pours himself a single glass lights the one cigarette with the lone match there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this
he inhales deeply makes a toasting gesture then drinks smokes smiles
hold briefly then paul exiting his cabin
he stops makes a snowball throws it hitting a sign
still got it
he throws a suitcase into the trunk of his mustang and holding his leather case he hops into the car and drives away
a sign that reads silver creek lodge
behind the sign is the hotel itself old desolate
now the mustang comes out of the garage guns ahead toward the sign
as shotgun by jr
walker and the allstars starts he heads off into the mountains
gun metal grey
the clouds seem pregnant with snow
paul driving the mustang the battered briefcase on the seat beside him
the road ahead
little dainty flakes of snow are suddenly visible
the car going into a curve and paul driving and as he comes out of the curve a stunned look hits his face as we the road ahead and here
it comes a mountain storm its as if the top has been pulled off the sky and with no warning whatsoever were into a blizzard and the mustang slowing driving deeper into the mountains
paul squinting ahead windshield wipers on now
the mustang rounding another curve losing traction paul a skilled driver bringing the car easily under control
snow is piling up
paul driving confidently carefully
now he reaches out ejects the tape expertly turns it over pushes it in and as the music continues he hums along with it
only you cant see it
theres nothing to see but the unending snow nothing to hear but the wind which keeps getting wilder
inches of snow on the ground now
this is desolate and dangerous
the road curving sharply drop ping
a sign reads curved road next miles
the mustang coming into view hitting the curve no problem no problem at all and then suddenly there is a very serious problem and as the car skids out of
control paul doing his best fighting the conditions and just as it looks like hes got things going his way the road swerving down and the mustang all traction gone and paul helpless and the mustang skidding skidding and the road as it drops more steeply away and the wind whips the snow across and the mustang starting to spin and the mountainside as the car skids off the road careens down slams into a tree bounces off flips lands upside down skids stops finally dead
there is still the sound of the wind and there is still the music coming from the tape perhaps the only part of the car left undamaged
nothing moves inside
there is only the wind and the tape
the wind gets louder
the wreck looked at from a distance
the music sounds are only faintly heard
the area where the wreck is as seen from the road
the car is barely visible as the snow begins to cover it
the wreck from outside and were close to it now with the snow coming down ever harder already bits of the car are covered in white
hes inside and doing his best to fight is but his consciousness is going
he tries to keep his eyes open but theyre slits
slowly he manages to reach out with his left arm for his briefcase and he clutches it to his battered body
the music continues on
but paul is far from listening
his eyes flutter flutter again
now theyre starting to close
the man is dying
motionless he still clutches the battered briefcase
hold on the case
then the briefcase in pauls hands as he sits at a desk
we are in new york city in the office of pauls literary agent marcia sindell
the walls of the large room are absolutely crammed with book and movie posters in english and all other kinds of other languages all of them featuring the character of
misery chastain a perfectly beautiful woman
miserys challenge miserys triumph eight of them
all written by paul sheldon
paul lifting up the battered briefcase maybe when new it cost two bucks but he treats it like gold
an old friend
i was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there
like it was waiting for me
searching for a compliment its
its nice paul
when i wrote my first book i used to carry it around in this while i was looking for a publisher
that was a good book marcia
i was a writer then
youre still a writer
i havent been a writer since i got into the misery business holding up the cover art of miserys child not a bad business
this thing would still be growing too
the first printing order on miserys child was the most ever over a million
misery chastain put braces on your daughters teeth and is putting her through college bought you two houses and floor seats to the knick games and what thanks does she
you go and kill her
marcia you know i started misery on a lark
do i look like a guy who writes romance novels
do i sound like danielle steel
it was a one time shot and we got lucky
i never meant it to become my life
and if i hadnt gotten rid of her now id have ended up writing her forever
touches his briefcase for the first time in fifteen years i think im really onto something here
im glad to hear that paul i really am
but you have to know when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine theyre not going to say ooh good paul sheldon can finally write what
weve always wanted an esoteric semi autobiographical character study
passionately marcia why are you doing this to me
dont you know im scared enough
dont you think i remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books
you think im dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness
beat im doing this because i have to
marcia is stopped now im leaving for colorado to try to finish this and i want your good thoughts because if i can make it work
beat i might just have something that i want on my tombstone
on the word tombstone pauls tombstone the upside down car with the blizzard coming gale force and his motionless body trapped inside the car
the wind screams
pauls eyes flutter then close
hold keep holding as suddenly theres a new sound as a crowbar scratches at the door nd now the door is ripped open as we a bundled up figure gently
beginning to pull paul and the case from the car
for a moment its hard to tell if its a man or woman not to let the cat out of the bag or anything but it is very much a
her name is annie wilkes and she is close to pauls age
she is in many ways a remarkable creature
strong self sufficient passionate in her likes and dislikes loves and hates
paul and annie as she cradles him in her arms
once hes clear of the car she lays him carefully in the snow paul and annie close up
she slowly brings her mouth down close to his
then their lips touch as she forces air inside him
their lips touch again
then you hear me breathe
i said breathe
paul as he starts to breathe in a moment his eyes suddenly open wide but hes in shock the eyes see nothing annie the moment she sees him come to
life she goes into action lifting paul in a firemans carry starting the difficult climb back up the steep hill
as she moves away she and paul are obliterated by the white falling snow
the white of what seems like a hospital
everything is bled of color
its all vague we are looking at this from pauls blurred vision
and throughout this next sequence there are these sounds words really but they make no sense
im your number one fan
the first thing we see during this is something all white
it takes a moment before we realize its a ceiling
now a white wall
bottle is next the medicine dripping down a tube into pauls left arm
the other arm is bandaged and in a sling
annie is standing beside the bed
she wears off white and seems very much like a nurse
a good nurse
she has pills in her hands
motionless dead pale
he has a little beard now
eyes barely open hes shaking with fever
hardly able to whisper where
annie is quickly by his side
so gently shhh
were just outside silver creek
youve been here two days
youre gonna be okay
relieved my name is annie wilkes and im my number one fan
and now the gibberish words make sense
im also a nurse
now as she brings the pills close take these
she helps him to swallow as pauls eyes close
an exterior of the place
its a farmhouse we re in a desolate area with mountains in the background
the house is set on a knoll so that pauls room although on the first floor is ten feet off the ground
paul in the room
hes not on the i
his fever has broken
annie enters pills in her hand
what are they
theyre called novril theyre for your pain
helps him take them annie applies a cool rag to his forehead
shouldnt i be in a hospital
the blizzard was too strong
i couldnt risk trying to get you there
i tried calling but the phone lines are down
paul tries to test his left arm
gently her fingers go to his eyelids close them now you mustnt tire yourself
youve got to rest you almost died
annie close up
sometimes her face shows the most remarkable compassion
it does now
hold on it briefly
he lies in bed
his fever is gone but hes terribly weak
as she lays the pills on pauls tongue she gives him a glass of water from the nearby bed table
paul swallowing eagerly
annie watching him sympathetically
your legs just sing grand opera when you move dont they
paul says nothing but his pain is clear its not going to hurt forever paul i promise you
will i be able to walk
of course you will
and your arm will be fine too
your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly but i finally popped it back in there
proudly but what im most proud of is the work i did on those legs
considering what i had around the house i dont think theres a doctor who could have done any better
and now suddenly she flicks off the blankets uncovering his body
paul staring stunned at the bottom half of his body as we pauls legs
from the knees down he resembles an egyptian mummy shes splinted them with slim steel rods that look like the hacksawed remains of aluminum crutches and theres taping circling around
from the kness up theyre all swollen and throbbing and horribly bruised and discolored
paul lying back stunned with disbelief
its not nearly as bad as it looks
you have a compound fracture of the tibia in both legs and the fibula in the left leg is fractured too
i could hear the bones moving so its best for your legs to remain immobile
and as soon as the roads open ill take you to a hospital
in the meantime youve got a lot of recovering to do and i consider it an honor that youll do it in my home
hold on her ecstatic face
then miserys perfect face
were back in sindells office in new york
the office looks just the same posters and manuscripts all over
but she doesnt
she holds the phone and she is fidgety insecure
this is marcia sindell calling from new york city
id like to speak to the silver creek chief of police or the sheriff
which one do you want
whichever ones not busy
with a view of the mountains
a marvelous looking man sits at a desk by himself holding the phone
in his sixties hes still as bright fast and sassy as he was half a lifetime ago
never mind what his name is everyone calls him buster
im pretty sure they re both not busy ms
sindell since theyre both me
i also happen to be president of the policemans benefit association chairman of the patrolmans retirement fund and if you need a good fishing guide you could do a lot
worse call me buster everybody does what can i do for you
sindell in her office
she pushes the speakerphone gets up paces shes very hesitant when she speaks about paul
almost embarrassed im a literary agent and i feel like a fool calling you but i think one of my clients paul sheldon might be in some kind of trouble
you mean paul sheldon the writer
hes your client huh
yes he is
he rolls a penny across the back of one hand hes very good at it doesnt even look while he does it
people sure like those misery books
im sure you know pauls been going to the silver creek lodge for years to finish his books
yeah i understand hes been up here the last six weeks
i just called and they said he checked out five days ago
isnt that a little strange
i dont know
does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels
sindell really embarrassed now
no no of course not
its just that his daughter hasnt heard from him and when hes got a book coming out he usually keeps in touch
so when there was no word from him
you think he might be missing
shakes her head i hate that i made this call tell me im being silly
he nods as a woman enters carrying lunch
its his wife virginia
she begins putting the food down on a table for the both of them
just a little over protective maybe
beat tell you what nothings been reported out here he puts paul sheldons name with a
on a x card but ill put his name through our system
he tacks the card to a bulletin board and if anything turns up ill call you right away
she smiles a genuine sense of relief
i appreciate that
thanks a lot
as he hangs up we actually got a phone call
smiles work work work
gives her a hug virginia
when was that blizzard
four or five days ago
the penny flies across the back of his hand
he doesnt look at it stares instead out the window at the mountains
a beat no reason
hold on buster for a moment
soft i guess it was kind of a miracle
you finding me
annies soft sweet laughter is heard
she stands over him finishing shaving him with a very sharp straight razor
she wears what we will come to know as her regular costume plain wool skirts grey cardigan sweaters
no it wasnt a miracle at all
in a way i was following you
annie concentrates on shaving him with great care she has wonderful strong hands
explaining normally well it wasnt any secret to me that you were staying at the silver creek seeing as how im your number one fan and all
some nights id just tool on down there sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin gently moves his head back exposing his neck this next is
said with total sincerity almost awe and id try to imagine what was going on in the room of the worlds greatest writer
say that last part again i didnt quite hear smiles dont move now wouldnt want to hurt this neck shaving away well the other afternoon i was on my way
home and there you were leaving the lodge and i wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming
i didnt know it was going to be a big storm
lucky for you i did
pauses lucky for me too
because now youre alive and you can write more books
oh paul ive read everything of yours but the misery novels
i know them all by heart paul all eight of them
i love them so
paul looking at her
theres something terribly touching about her now
youre very kind
and youre very brilliant and you must be a good man or you could never have created such a wondrous loving creature as misery chastain
runs her fingers over his cheek like a baby
smiles all done
starts to dab away the last bits of soap annie starts cleaning up
when do you think the phone linesll be back up
i have to call my daughter and i should call new york and let my agent know im breathing
it shouldnt be too much longer
gently once the roads are open the linesll be up in no time
if you give me their numbers ill keep trying them for you
suddenly almost embarrassed could i ask you a favor
paul nods i noticed in your case there was a new paul sheldon book and
hesitant and i wondered if maybe
her voice trails off you want to read it
quietly if you wouldnt mind
i have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage only my editor my agent and anyone who saves me from freezing to
death in a car wreck
genuinely thrilled youll never realize what a rare treat youve given me
his eyes close briefly he grimaces
annie watching him concerned
she glances at her watch
boy its like clockwork the way your pain comes ill get you your novril paul
forgive me for prattling away and making you feel all oogy
she turns and goes out of the room
paul watching her
whats your new book called
i dont have a title yet
whats it about
fast its crazy but i dont really know i mean i havent written anything but misery for so long that you read it you can tell me what you think
maybe you can come up with a title
in the doorway oh like i could do that
small neat one window outside snow covers all
buster and libby the manager are going over books and records
libby is an old guy walks with a cane
nothing unusual about mr
sheldons leaving buster you can tell by the champagne
maybe you can libby
no see he always ordered a bottle of dom perignon when he was ready to go
then hed pay up and be out the door
no long distance phone calls federal express packages anything at all out of the ordinary
head shake i dont think mr
sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary
considering who he is and all famous and all he doesnt have airs
drives the same car out from new york each time mustang said it helps him think
he was always a good guest never made a noise never bothered a soul
sure hope nothing happened to him
so do i
ill bet that old mustangs pulling into new york right now
im sure youre right
but you can tell hes not sure at all as we he lies in bed
sun comes in the lone window
annie sits on the bed a large bowl of soup in her hands feeding him
almost shy about this i know im only forty pages into your book but
she stops fills the spoon up again
no what is it
oh its ridiculous who am i to make a criticism to someone like you
i can take it go ahead
well its brilliantly written but then everything you write is brilliant
pretty rough so far
a burst the swearing paul
beat there i said it
the profanity bothers you
it has no nobility
well these are slum kids i was a slum kid everybody talks like that
she holds the soup bowl in one hand the muddy colored beef barley soup close to spilling
they do not
what do you think i say when i go to the feed store in town
now wally give me a bag of that effing pigfeed and ten pounds of that bitchly cow corn paul is amused by this
the soup almost spilling as she gets more agitated
and in the bank do i tell mrs
bollinger heres one big bastard of a check give me some of your christing money
paul almost laughing as some soup hits the coverlet
seeing the spill suddenly upset there
see what you made me do
paul his smile disappears
annie and she is just totally embarrassed
oh paul im sorry
im so sorry
sometimes i get so worked up
can you ever forgive me
she hands him his pills and starts to clean the soup off the coverlet
then she makes the sweetest smile
i love you paul
more embarrassed than ever your mind
your creativity thats all i meant
flustered she turns away as we a road in the mountains
piles of snow all around but its been ploughed enough so its driveable
a car coming into view
up ahead is the sign weve already seen curved road next miles
buster and his wife virginia virginia is driving while buster intently studies the terrain
he reaches for a large thermos pours some coffee offers it to her
she shakes her head
he begins to sip it
this sure is fun
she puts her hand on his leg
removing it virginia when youre in this car youre not my wife youre my deputy
well this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the sheriff
suddenly it goes into a little icy spin she fights it back under control
suddenly stop stop right here
what is it
the car skidding slowing stopping
both of them get out go to the edge of the road
mountains of snow
nothing much else visible
then buster points
look at that broken branch there
virginia seeing it unconvinced
could be the weight of the snow
could be or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it
could be a lot of things
he steps off the road starts down
virginia watching him worried its very slippery
buster graceful in great shape navigating down easily
the tree that the car ran into
buster reaches it studies it
virginia staring out after him she cant see him because the drop is both too steep and covered with trees and mounds of snow
anything down there
an enormous amount of snow
hes moved away from the tree now going toward where the mustang is buried
the mound of snow with the mustang inside
buster making his way closer to it closer staring around
nothing to be seen everything is covered with mountains of snow
you could have a house down there and not be able to see it
just glaring white
buster angry frustrated turning around and around and buster from another angle from behind the mound with the mustang inside and out of his sight glistening in the sun a
bit of the door protrudes
but of course buster cant see it
hold on buster in a sour mood staring around as the edge of the door continues to glisten
virginia on the road as buster makes his way back up still ticked
they move to the car you really think sheldons out there
hope not if he is hes dead
lets go to the newspaper office
as they get in the car another car driving by its annie in her jeep neither she nor buster notice each other
the door opens and annie enters
oh im sorry
i didnt mean to wake you
pauls eyes fluttering awake to see the hardback copy of his novel miserys child in annies hands
shes never been more excited they had it at the store paul there was a whole batch of them there
as soon as i saw it i slammed my money down
i got the first copy
then the roads are open
the one to town is but thats about it
i called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon
i told him who you were and what had happened
he said as long as theres no infection youre not in any danger and as soon as the road to the hospital is open theyll send an ambulance for you
the phones are working
well mines still out
but the ones in town were working just fine
i called that agent of yours
soft now oh paul i peeked at the very beginning
looks at him what a wonderful first page just to read the name misery chastain
my daughter must be going nuts
its like a visit from my oldest dearest friend
i was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago
your agent said she would tell her you were okay
but im afraid youll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself
she starts to leave stops at the door
she looks at him now with almost a look of amazement oh paul what a poet you are
as she leaves paul watching as she enters moves to him carrying a tray
i made you my speciality scrambled eggs a la wilkes
and im on page
i guess that means its okay
no it isnt its halts oh pooh i cant think of any words
would great be insulting
i can live with great
he starts with effort to eat
as she turns goes no its not just great its perfect a perfect perfect thing
annie is clearing pauls tray
she hands him his novril he quickly swallows them
im up to page
i always get sad when i pass the halfway point
will you do me a favor
id love it if you would autograph my copy
i already have your autograph on a picture but it would mean so much to me to get it in person
i know youre right handed so dont worry if its not so legible
ill cherish it anyway
as paul signs the book i dont mean to pry but ive read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials
and i said it cant be true
paul sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that
well you cant believe everything you read in magazines
i knew it
i knew it wasnt true
boy how do they get away with printing stuff like that
youd be amazed at what some people will believe
he finishes the autograph hands the book back to her
thank you so much
it opens and guess what a sow lumbers in
paul kind of stunned as this female pig skitters its way around the room excited confused slipping and sliding
annie all smiles and happiness laughing in the doorway
i thought it was time you two should meet
paul say hello to my favorite beast in all the world my sow misery
the pig snorting around the room
paul and annie watching it
i told you i was your number one fan
im getting to believe you
this farm was getting kind of dreary what with just the few cows and chickens and me happy but when i got misery here everything changed she just makes me
shes a fine
pig is what she is
scooping up the pig holding it tight as she stands by paul im on page three hundred now paul and its better than perfect its divine
whats the ceiling that dago painted
the sistine chapel
yeah that and miserys child those are the only two divine things ever in this world
paul watches as the pig skitters out of the room with annie in pursuit happily imitating the pig
whuh whuh whoink
paul staring after them what the hell was that
annies voice is heard softly
when my husband left me
i wasnt prepared it wasnt an easy time
annie standing at the window her back to the room
in bed paul is dealing with a bedpan peeing
for a while i thought i might go crazy
i know how that can be
i dont know about you but what i did to get through it was i dove into work days nights night shifts can be lonely at a hospital
i did a lot of reading
that was hen i first discovered misery
she made me so happy
she made me forget all my problems
she smiles now course i suppose you had a little something to do with that too
there is a peeing sound
he is embarrassed
she isnt i just kept reading them over and over
i know when i finish this one and ive only got two chapters to go ill just turn right to the front page and start reading it again
she turns around moves to the bed done
as she takes the bedpan
dont get me wrong
im not against marriage per se
but it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again
well its not something you should enter into lightly
it boils down to respect
people just dont respect the institution of marriage any more
they have no sense of real commitment
paul attempting to smile
there is not much he can say to this
id love to stay here and chat but im right at the end and i gotta find out what happens
well i hope you like it
of course ill like it
miserys about to have her child
whats it gonna be a boy or a girl
ooh dont tell me
with that she exits
hes been dozing but now his eyes flutter awake as we the door
it opens and annie enters comes to his bedside
hard to see
he squints up as we annie
close up her face is ashen pale
you dirty bird
she cant be dead
misery chastain cannot be dead
how could you
annie in women often died in childbirth but her spirit is the important thing and miserys spirit is still alive screaming i dont want her spirit
i want her
and you murdered her
then who did
no one she just died she slipped away thats all
screaming she slipped away
she slipped away
she didnt just slip away
you did it
you did it
you did it
you did it
you murdered my misery
and now she has lifted a chair its heavy but shes very strong and she raises it and turns on paul and its high above her head and paul realizes
that this might be it she might shatter him with it crunch his skull and thats just what she seems shes about to do and then she swings it not against him but against the wall and it shatters and shes panting from the effort as she turns on him again her voice surprisingly soft
i thought you were good paul but youre not good youre just another lying old dirty birdie and i dont think i better be around you for awhile
she crosses to the door then stops and dont even think about anybody coming for you not the doctors not your agent not your family because i never called them
nobody knows youre here
and you better hope nothing happens to me because if i die you die
paul watching as she closes the door behind her
then there is a rattle of a key and the sound of the door to his room annie getting in her cherokee and gunning away
paul lies still
he looks around the room and listens for sounds
all he hears are the sounds of a winter night in the mountains
after a few beats he takes a deep breath and then begins his greatest effort of all to force his body out of bed to make it move
hes still weak from what hes endured but thats not the main thing its the pain
any attempt at movement and his legs scream
he sags back lies there still a moment
slowly he tries to maneuver his body off the bed
he rolls over onto his stomach then tries to lower himself onto the floor by moving down head first
his good arm hits the floor and he is able to hold himself up but realizing there is no way to get out of bed without causing tremendous pain he
girds himself and flings himself out of bed and comes crashing to the floor
the pain is excruciating
after he regains his composure he slowly crawls toward the door
he reaches up and tries the handle
it is in fact locked
he awkwardly tries to slam up against the door but it is much too painful and to no avail
he crawls back over to the bed realizes theres no way to climb back in then grabs the blanket from the bed wraps it around himself and closes his eyes
he sits alone at his desk on the telephone staring at the rocky mountain gazette spread in front of him
in a prominent spot on the top is what is most likely a book jacket photo of paul
above the picture is the following buster is on the phone with marcia sindell
sindell theres no point in coming up here now
everything that can be done is
yes were working closely with the state police and the fbi has been informed
as soon as we know anything well let you know
no its no bother
virginia enters carrying some files
heres the list of all sheldons credit charges
nothing after the silver creek
with a glance at his dour face she indicates the photo any calls
just from his agent
his eyes flick up to her
an almost imperceptible shake of the head
hold for a moment then faces
they are distorted and they come into view but briefly then change into the next distorted face
all kinds there is no order to them young oriental female male pretty sad black not so pretty happy white old what we hear is this
youve changed my life
im your number one fan
im a really big fan of yours
im your biggest fan
dont ever stop writing those misery books
ive read all your books but the miserys
im your number one fan
youve given me such pleasure
i feel like youre writing just for me
and now it gets kicked up in speed and all goes faster many times overlapping
i love you
im your number one fan
im your biggest fan
we love you
you poor dear thing
this last was said by annie out of focus and for a moment she stays that way the room as it snaps back into focus annie is standing by the
it is dusk
she wears a dark blue dress and a hat with a sprig of flowers
her eyes are bright and vivacious the fact is this is the prettiest annie wilkes has ever looked
what are you doing on the floor
crossing to the bed its my fault
if id had a proper hospital bed this never would have happened
here let me help you back in
she lifts him back into the bed which causes considerable pain i know this hurts but itll only take a few seconds
there you go
in pain perfect
youre such a kidder
i have a big surprise for you
but first theres something you must do
i dont suppose i could have a little snack while i wait for the surprise
ill get you everything you want but you must listen first
sometimes my thinking is a little muddy i accept that
its why i couldnt remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in denver
now she turns goes to the doorway keeping on talking
she is never out of sight
but this time i thought clearly
i asked god about you and god said i delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way
show me the way
she exits and re enters wheeling something toward his bed
its a charcoal barbecue the kind you use in summer for cooking hamburgers
she holds several items in her arms a box of diamond blue tip wooden matches a can of lighter fluid
and most noticeably pauls manuscript
annie and paul
he watches mute as she takes off the grill puts the manuscript into the barbecue itself where the charcoal goes spritzes it with lighter fluid
the grill is close enough to the bed for him to reach out and drop a match
when i mentioned a snack i was thinking more along the lines of a cheese and crackers kind of thing
annie looking at him
paul this is no time for jokes
you must rid the world of this filth
she hands him the box of kitchen matches
you want me to burn my book
she nods yes
you want me to burn my book
i know this may be difficult for you but its for the best
this isnt difficult my agents made dozens of copies
theres gonna be an auction on this and every publishing house in new york is reading it now
so if you want me to burn it fine
youre not ridding the world of anything
annie watching him
quietly then light the match paul
no big deal
so youve indicated
pauls hands are starting to tremble now
he cant do it
i know this is the only copy paul
when you were twenty four you wrote your first book and you didnt make a copy because you didnt think anybody would take it seriously
but they did
and ever since youve never made any copies because youre superstitious its why you always come back to the silver creek lodge
you told that story to merv griffin eleven years ago
you know annie this book never would have survived without you
when it gets to new york there will be a big auction and whatever it brings we can split
pause god knows youre entitled to it
this isnt about money
its about decency and purity
its about gods values
i dont know what i was thinking
ill tell you what
it doesnt have to be published
nobody ever has to see it
ill just keep it for myself
no one will ever have to know it exists
as long as it does exist your mind wont ever be free
i think you should light the match paul
there is a long silence
paul doesnt move
cant you see its what god wants
shes holding the can of lighter fluid in her hand as she speaks and absentmindedly flicks a few drops of the fluid on the bed
youre so brilliant
i would think youd certainly be able to see that
more drops fall on the bed were put on this earth to help people paul
like im trying to help you
paul watches as the fluid continues to drop on the bed
please let me help you
his hands shaking
almost robot like he strikes one
youre doing the right thing paul
the barbecue as pauls hand appears drops the match on the fluid soaked manuscript
for a moment nothing and then kaboom the goddamn thing practically explodes and paul staring dazed and as the flames leap higher annie suddenly scared and startled at the heat
and the size of the flames and the full baking heat and crying out goodness
the sound is louder as the flames leap up and now charred bits of paper begin floating upward and annie watching as more bits of paper rise
goodness goodness oh my gracious and she starts trying to catch them
a piece of burning paper in midair floating against the gauzy curtain and for a moment it looks like the curtain will catch fire and annie panicked racing out of
the room going goodness heavens to betsy the barbecue and whats left of the book
paul and he cannot take his eyes off the disaster
annie hurrying back in carrying a big bucket slopping water as she lifts the bucket
the last of the manuscript as the bucket of water is tossed onto it theres hissing and steam and as the steam clears it all looks now like a log
in a brackish pond
well isnt that an oogy mess
as she starts to wheel the barbecue out suddenly there is a new and different sound as we paul head turning toward the window
annie taking a step toward the window stopping for a moment
the sound were hearing is a motor
a helicopter motor
and its getting louder
annie goes to the window now looks toward the sky as we a helicopter flying along
buster and a pilot are in the machine
buster has a pair of binoculars looped around his neck a map rumpled in his lap
pointing out thats the steadman place up there
the pilot nods
buster points again the only other place up here is the wilkes farm
the pilot points down
buster stares through the binoculars
what he sees annies jeep parked in front of her house
thats no mustang
theres nothing else out this way circle on back
as the pilot starts to change direction annie at the window watching as the helicopter turns starts off
paul listening as the motor sound recedes
annie staring out the window
i do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year
people say it has something to do with the ozone layer
what do you think
i dont know
yeah well its a theory
heres your novril
she wheels the barbecue to the door stops how does tuna casserole sound for dinner
paul takes the two novril stares at them then deliberately tucks them under his mattress
as paul is finishing the last of his tuna casserole
there are two novrils on his tray
we hear strains of tv game show theme music
these sounds are not surprising
paul has heard them before
it is much smaller than pauls and filled with religious bric a brac pictures of paul sheldon and a tv on a portable stand
annie lies in bed with an open bag of cheetos resting on her stomach and a big quart sized plastic bottle of coke on the nightstand
as she munches away she is heavily engrossed in her favorite tv show the love connection
as chuck woolery extracts the embarrassing details of a couples romantic interlude we paul faintly hearing the sounds of the tv
he has now finished eating
he takes the two novril from under the mattress
he then undoes the sheet takes his fork and delicately pokes a hole in the mattress then stuffs all four pills back into the hole
coming up to dawn
pauls door slowly opening
paul staring at the door
wheels seen from underneath the bed being rolled around the foot of the bed
we realize paul is in a wheelchair with annie pushing him
see isnt this nice
ive always wanted to visit the other side of the room
and look what ive got for you
an electric razor so you can shave yourself now
if i knew this was gonna be the surprise you couldve gotten me to burn all my books
she hands him some novril now dont josh
this is a very big day for you paul
you just sit tight and ill set everything up
paul quickly shoving the novril into the mattress
set what up
thats the big surprise
your new studio after all writers do need a place to work
you mean write
what in the world do you think id write
oh but paul
flushed i dont think i know
now that youve gotten rid of that nasty manuscript you can go back to doing what youre great at beat youre going to write a new novel your greatest achievement
ever miserys return
after a beat miserys return
i know you didnt mean it when you killed her and now youll make it right
annie close up
in an almost religious fervor
it will be a book in my honor
for saving your life and nursing you back to health
ill be the first one to read it
beat oh paul youre going to make me the envy of the whole world
you just expect me to whip something off that it
nods i expect nothing less than your masterpiece
you do understand that this isnt the ordinary way books get written i mean some people might actually consider this an oddball situation
she rolls him over to a table she has set up by the window
i have total confidence in your brilliance besides the view will inspire you
the window as the wheelchair approaches it
the sky is innocent of clouds
theres a green forest climbing the flank of the nearest mountain
a plot of open ground between the house and the mountain
a neat red barn where the livestock stay
a jeep cherokee maybe five years old
a fisher plow
and no neighbors in sight
this is a desolate place
you just inhale that
ill be right back
paul staring out the window
calling out i guess you dont get bothered by neighbors much
dont worry about that
youll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work
annie in the doorway carrying reams of typing paper pencils pens and sharpener
paul watching her its all kind of amazing
she hands him a box of typing paper
i got you this expensive paper to type on
paul looking at the paper
its corrasable bond
an idea hits him he masks it as best he can
putting the rest of the paper on the table and i got a great deal on this fifty pound clunker on account of its missing an n
i told the saleslady n was one of the letters in my favorite writers name
its two of the letters in my favorite nurses name annie
embarrassed blushing you fooler
turns grabs up pens pencils paper did i do good
gesturing to the box of paper you did great except theres just one little thing i cant work with this paper
its corrasable bond it smudges
maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white long grained mimeo
but mine cost the most so i dont see how it could smudge
quickly taking a sheet of paper making a pencil mark on it cmere ill show you
as she approaches he rubs his thumb over the pencil mark
looking at it well it does smudge after all isnt that fascinating
i thought youd be interested
id like you to be in on everything annie
not just the finished book but how its written
thank you for thinking of me
she can be so charming when she wants anything else i can get while im in town
any other crucial requirements that need satisfying
would you like a tiny tape recorder
or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers
no just the paper will be fine
suddenly very agitated are you sure
cause if you want ill bring back the whole store for you
annie whats the matter
whats the matter
ill tell you whats the matter
i go out of my way for you
i do everything to try and make you happy
i feed you i clean you i dress you
and what thanks do i get
you bought the wrong paper annie
i cant write on this paper annie
well ill get your stupid paper but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here mister man
with that she throws the ream of paper in pauls lap causing considerable pain
the door as she slams it shut locks it stomps off and the window
annie in a parka can be seen storming out in the direction where her cherokee was parked
she gets in and drives off
he heaves a sigh reaches out toward his tortured knees then drops his head
he sees something
bobby pin on the floor
paul as he moves toward the bobby pin
or tries to
its brutally hard for him
the chair moves half a foot
paul strains again
another half foot
the bobby pin
the wheelchair is beside it now
paul reaches down for it
cant make it
he takes a deep breath forces himself to bend ignoring the pain
the bobby pin is in his hands
paul inserting the bobby pin into the keyhole beginning to jimmy the lock
the lock it makes a sound something has caught
paul excited trying to force the bobby pin and hes doing great until it slips from his hands falls to the floor again
the bobby pin
paul reaches for it
the pain has him
he reaches again involuntarily cries out
but he grabs it clutches it tight
paul is trying to jimmy the lock a second time
in wild frustration
youve written how to do this now do it
there is a loud clicking sound
the door as paul turns the knob
the door opens a crack
amazed what do you know it actually works
paul trying to get out of the room but its a bitch because in order to get to the lock he had to move the wheelchair up to the door
and in order to get out hes got to maneuver it out of the way of the door and every turn of the chairs wheels is an effort for him
he works at it and works at it but his energy is failing him
hes pale perspiring
finally he succeeds barely forces his way into the hall
paul in the hallway outside
he looks around for a phone
doesnt see one
he wheels himself over to the front door tries it
its locked from the outside
what a surprise
he looks off into the living room and
paul wheeling into the living room
dark red predominates
its a musty room
over the mantel a photograph of a six year old annie with her mother and father in front of the family car a new buick
these were happier times
the windows have bars on them
as paul begins to wheel as fast as he can toward the phone the phone as paul at last grabs for it gets it punches the operator button operator
nothing wildly frustrated shit
he shakes the phone
its terribly light
he picks it up turns it over its hollow just a shell of a telephone
he stares at it for a long moment shaking his head the disappointment plain
you crazy bitch
he puts the phone back on the table
annie exits the store carrying new paper hops into her cherokee and drives off
the study as paul enters
he looks around
its stuffed with heavy graceless furniture as well as lots of coffee tables covered with knickknacks
as he with effort wheels across it a shelf of books
paul sheldon books
every paul sheldon book
paul pausing looking at her collection
the only book on the shelf that isnt his is a large scrapbook
the title on the back reads my life
he glances back at the shelf as he forces his wheelchair across the study and we a small table with little ceramic doodads on top
the wheelchair his it one of the doodads topples its a penguin fragile looking and as its about to fall to the floor and shatter paul grabbing for it catching
it putting it back where it was
he continues his slow way across the room and out in the hallway on his way toward the kitchen paul notices a door to his right
he wheels over and surprisingly it opens
however this is not a door to the outside of the house only a storage pantry
he looks around nothing but canned goods potato chips cereals and large plastic coke containers etc
just as he is about to close the door he notices an open cardboard box
he opens the flap and sees all kinds of prescription drugs
among them are a couple of strips of novril encapsulated in blisters
he grabs them and stuffs them into his sweatpants
now he closes the pantry door and heads to the kitchen
as paul approaches it
he starts to wheel his way in but he has trouble
he backs up slightly wheels forward again but the door is too narrow for the chair to fit through
he pounds his fists on the chair arm staring as we the back door
its at the far end of the kitchen leading to the outside
it seems somehow less formidable than the front door did
the windows around the kitchen are barred
paul staring at the kitchen door then without warning he makes his move starting to lower himself out of the chair gently to the floor only it doesnt work that
its too awkward he doesnt have the strength to maneuver properly and his body tilts awkwardly out of the chair slams hard against the hard floor
paul crying out in pain as he lands
he lies there for a moment
little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now
he is hurting
he closes his eyes gathering strength and then slowly very slowly inch by inch he moves his body across the floor toward the kitchen door
the kitchen door
its still a long way away
paul ignoring his pain his awkwardness making his body move
the kitchen door
paul growing pale but he wont stop and now the door is just ahead of him and with his good arm he reaches out and up and grabs the doorknob
the kitchen door
paul close up
the disappointment and anger is plain on his face
his arm drops
he lies still for a moment panting from his effort
then paul and his eyes are wide for a moment
you can feel his wild excitement as we sitting on the counter a set of carving knives sticking out of a slotted wooden block
they seem to be out of reach but that doesnt stop him
he starts to crawl over to the counter
annie is driving along in her cherokee
she is heading home
now at the counter paul tries to pull himself up with his one good arm but even though he is able to chin himself up to the top of the
counter he is still unable to reach the knives
he makes a desperate attempt which sends him crashing to the floor
as he starts to force his way up again from outside there comes a sound the motor of a car
annie driving up to the house
paul throwing himself back to the floor starting a wild crawl back across the kitchen toward the wheelchair and annie getting out of her jeep and paul crawling crawling and
annie walking around to the back of the jeep and paul scrambling wildly up into his wheelchair starting to get it turned and annie opening the back of the jeep and lifting out several rectangular boxes of paper and paul straightened out now forcing the wheelchair to move and now were into a race a crazed life and death race and the cuts go fast and annie closes the door of the car and paul is suddenly stuck theres no traction on the rug ow annie purchases in hand starts away from the car for the house and now paul is finally moving toward the bedroom
and annie is moving swiftly toward the front door
he drops one of the packages of paper
paul still biting down churning his arms with all the strength he has left
pauls arms aching start to turn to rubber
annies feet walking quickly across the snow covered area in front of the house and the bedroom door as paul gets through it shuts it and attacks the bedroom lock
with the bobby pin and annie unlocking the front door of the house and the bedroom door as it locks and the front door unlocking and annie balancing the bundles under her chin as she jiggles the key out of the front door lock and paul soaked
her voice from the hallway close and growing closer paul ive got your paper
he wheels to exactly where he was when she left him
he at last allows himself a sigh of relief
the door as the sound of a lock clicking is heard
just the kind you asked for
and as the door opens paul looking down
pauls waistband a half a dozen strips of novril ominously stick out
as the door swings open he quickly covers the novril with this hands
annie in the doorway a strange look on her face
paul youre dripping with perspiration your color is very hectic what have you been doing
you know goddamn well what ive been doing ive been sitting here suffering
i need my pills
tenderly as she starts toward him poor dear
lets get you back in bed and ill get them for you
exploding a real childs tantrum i want my pills now
itll only take a second
i want my pain to go way annie make it go way please annie she looks at him you cant tell if shes buying it or not please
she stares a moment more then turns starts for the door
upset it just breaks my heart to see you like this
paul watching and the instant she is out the door in the hallway he stuffs the novril into his pants
coming closer ive done a lot of thinking on the drive
annie entering the room the novril in her hand
she is genuinely contrite
and im absolutely convinced that the main reason ive never been more popular is because of my temper
you must be so mad at me
the truth now
she hands him the pills
and rolls him over to the bed
well i dont hold grudges
after all who doesnt let off a little steam once in a while
paul putting the pills in his mouth as she picks him up from the chair and puts him gently down in bed
my genius needs his rest before he writes
she hands him a pad and pencil
here in case you think of any ideas
yeah well i wouldnt expect too much
dont be silly
youll be brilliant
think of me as your inspiration
the doorway as annie starts to it
i have faith in you
beat my darling
on that she turns for the first time a coquettish look comes to her face
catch this she throws him a kiss its grotesque ummmm wahhhh
paul summoning up all his courage as he mimes catching it and forces a smile on
she waves closes the door
hold on paul
the smile dies
he reaches in and pulls the two novril capsules out of his mouth
now buster and pilot flying along
buster is all bundled up as he stares out using the binoculars
something shiny reflecting the sun
hold as it almost blinds us were looking at the part of pauls mustang that was revealed by the snow when buster almost found the car
to pilot walter we could be skipping lunch today
pauls car being hoisted by chains from the ground and as it starts to rise up into the afternoon air
the area by the car buster is there and a bunch of state policemen and various media people are there buster stands with the state police chief watching as the
car is hoisted via derrick the sound of the powerful motor lifting the car is enormous and as the car keeps rising higher and higher and people take pictures and stare and the state police chief is addressing maybe a dozen reporters
its very cold
buster stands slightly away from the group
the presumption must now be that paul sheldon is dead
we know he somehow crawled out of his car
but we have been unable to locate his body in the vicinity of the crash
we also know if anyone had found him they would have taken him to an area hospital
his body is undoubtedly out there buried somewhere in the snow
well find him after the first thaw unless the animals have gotten to him first
beat ill take questions
after the first sentence a very cold and very unhappy buster leaves the gathering
pauls car as buster studies it especially the area by the drivers side where there are still dents visible from annies crowbar
virginia moves to him now
they exchange a glance start walking together toward their car
the chief surrounded people are asking questions raising hands for attention and as he answers them buster and virginia close together walking toward their car
you dont think hes dead do you
he might well be
but not the way they say
he didnt crawl out of that car by himself
you saw those dents on the door someone pulled him out
it was an old car those dents could have been there forever
theres two kinds of people that drive around in old cars the ones that cant afford new ones and the ones who wouldnt give em up for anything in the
that second bunch dont drive around with twenty five year old dents
as they drive off
paul lies in bed listening to the strains of the love connection coming from upstairs
as chuck woolery drones on paul is intently involved in folding a piece of paper from his pad
he is making a container of some sort
he finishes then reaches down and grabs the novril capsules that he has been stashing in the mattress
carefully he opens one and pours it into the palm of his hand
first he smells it no odor then he takes a tiny bit on a finger and tastes it no taste
then he takes his paper container and empties the contents of all the pills into it then places it under the mattress
now what to do with the empty capsules
he thinks for a second then what the hell he swallows them
he then places the packet back in the mattress
the window is visible behind it
from this angle it almost seems to be staring at paul broken n and all
paul tests his wounded arm
hes able to raise it a few inches but thats it
annie is visible heading for the barn followed by misery the pig
for a moment she stops turns to look back
calling out dont be nervous beat just remember ill treasure whatever you do
now as she turns again moves quickly away paul
he rolls in a piece of paper types briefly
by paul sheldo for a ie wilkes
paul studying the paper
he takes it out starts to roll in a new sheet
the machine as the new sheet is rolled in
paul staring at the blank page
he takes a deep breath glances outside then back to the paper
paul and now theres a brief light behind his eyes and suddenly he types a burst stares at what hes written
the paper and these words fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck
he closes his eyes briefly mutters something kind of nods opens his eyes grabs for another piece of paper rolls it in and starts mechanically to type
a new piece of paper with the words chapter two and a half paragraph of writing as we paul working in his room
annie enters the first pages of manuscript in her hands
im sorry paul
this is all wrong youll have to do it over again
totally stunned what
what happened to ill treasure whatever you do
paul its not worthy of you
throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me
you can leave that in
i really value your criticism but maybe youre being a little hasty here
paul what youve written just isnt fair
thats right when i was growing up in bakersfield my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on saturday afternoons for the chapter plays
it just comes out cliff hangers suddenly angry i know that mister man they also call them serials
im not stupid you know
and shes a child again anyway my favorite was rocket man and once it was a no brakes chapter the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain
road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and i was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe i was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was rocket man trying to get out and here came the cliff and just before the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered standing up now but i didnt cheer i stood right up and started shouting this isnt what happened last week have you all got amnesia
they just cheated annie close up
still in her childhood reverie
shouting they always cheated like that in cliff stops himself chapter plays
but not you
not with my misery
remember ian did ride for dr
cleary at the end of the last book but his horse fell jumping that fence and ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the
ditch so he never reached the doctor so there couldnt have been any experimental blood transfusion that saved her life
misery was buried in the ground at the end paul so youll have to start there
as she goes look at this ive got lizzie borden for an editor here
paul slumps staring barefully at the typewriter
paul is at the table
he takes the novril off his breakfast tray wheels over to the bed and stuffs them into the mattress
he hears footsteps coming down the hall
he smoothly wheels back to the table
annie enters to remove the tray
whats the matter paul
you havent written a word
i cant write this anymore
dont be silly
of course you can
im telling you i cant
you can you have the gotta the what
remember you talked about it in playboy magazine
you said theres a million things you cant do in this world you cant hit a curve ball you cant fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work but
theres one thing you always have and thats the power of the gotta
i said that
you said you can make it so they gotta turn the page
you know i gotta know will she live i gotta know will he catch the killer
i gotta see how this chapter ends
you said it
i dont usually buy that magazine
i only got it cause they were interviewing you
paul close up
quietly what about a bee
the keyboard as the piece of paper slides in and the keys start to move
annie stands there for a moment then quietly backs out of the room
its late afternoon
paul in the wheelchair watching as annie finishes reading
well is it fair
should i keep going
oh paul when ian realized that the reason theyd buried misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma annie in a fervor
and when gravedigger wilkes remembered how thirty years earlier the same thing had happened to lady evelyn hyde hands clasped and then old dr
cleary deduced that misery must be lady evelyn hydes long lost daughter because of the rarity of deadly bee stings my heart just leapt
paul watching her
its as if he had nothing to do with anything shes read as she goes on
ive known from the very first book that misery had to be born of nobility and i was right
mumbling to himself yeah yeah
the two of them she touches the pages as if they were gold rubbing gently with the tips of her fingers
oh paul can i read each chapter when you finish
i can fill in the n s
paul nods and shes off again will she be her old self now that ian has dug her out or will she have amnesia
have to wait
will she still love him with that special perfect love
have to wait
plead ing not even a hint
paul shakes his head
annie spinning around the room like a happy child
oh its so romantic this whole house is going to be filled with romance
im going to put on my liberace records stops looks at paul you do like liberace dont you
quickly whenever he played radio city who do you think was right there in the front row
im going to play my records all day to inspire you hes my all time favorite
and with that she starts to leave
she stops at the door
would you have dinner with me tonight
she cant speak
to celebrate miserys return
i couldnt have done it without you
it would be an honor
annie dashes excitedly out of the room
paul wheels over to the bed pulls the packet of novril powder out from the mattress and stuffs it in his pants
the sound of liberace playing tammy with orchestra and chorus booms in from beyond the door
virginia is on the phone
into phone no hes not here
i dont know where he went
he never tells me anything anymore
hes probably out having an affair somewhere
wait a minute
i think i hear him coming
buster enters carrying a bagful of books
to buster its jim taylor
he wants to know who youve been having an affair with
he puts the bag down shoots virginia a look and grabs the phone
virginia looks in the bag
hey jim whats doing
jim weve been over this
if youre gonna have benches in front of your store people are gonna sit on them
i dont like him either but im not going to come over there and tell him to move
give my best to denise
looking through the books all paperback misery novels well whoever she is she sure likes to read a lot
virginia im flattered you think i got that much energy
i just figured if i cant find paul sheldon at least i can find out what he wrote about
what do you expect to find
a story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm
now you see its that kind of sarcasm thats given our marriage real spice
paul is sitting at a table that annie has set up with her best china and silverware
it is as romantic as annie wilkes gets
annie enters carrying a basket of rolls
she sits and serves paul
i hope you like it
it looks wonderful
and so do you
they eat in awkward silence
finally ive never had meatloaf this good what do you do to it
my secret is i only use fresh tomatoes never canned
and to give it that little extra zip i mix in some spam with the ground beef
pause you cant get this in a restaurant in new york
after another pause annie i think we should have a toast
yes to misery
let me pour you some more wine
paul pours more of the gallo wine then raises his glass
wait lets do this right
do you have any candles
oh i dont know
i think so
ill go look
she exits into the kitchen
paul quickly pulls the packet filled with novril powder from his pants
he empties it into her glass of wine stuffs the empty packet back into his pants talking the whole time did you study decorating or do you just have a
i just picked things up over the years
well it certainly says you
you really think so
listen if you cant find any its okay
i just thought it might be nice
annie re enters with a candle
are you kidding
if anyone ever told me that one day id be having a candlelit dinner with paul sheldon in my own house i woulda checked both legs to see which one
was being pulled
will this do
she places the candle on the table
with a slight tremor in her hand she lights the candle
paul raises his glass
to misery and annie wilkes who brought her back to life
annie raises her glass
oh paul every time i think about it i get goosebumps
they clink glasses
and with that her emotions having gotten the best of her she knocks over the candle
in trying to right the situation she places her glass back down and as she reaches for the candle she knocks over her glass spilling the wine
wiping up the spilled wine with her napkin oh god what have i done
im so sorry paul
i ruined your beautiful toast
will you ever forgive me
here let me pour another one
she does can we pretend this never happened
so they drink their wine
the snow although still present has melted somewhat
and starting now and continuing throughout is this the sound of typing
paul working at his typewriter
annie in her room
reading and loving it
buster sitting in his den reading a misery novel by the fire
virginia brings him a cup of tea
paul the sling off moving his injured arm
its more mobile than before
testing his strength he uses his arm to remove the page and place it on the pile
he puts in another page and continues to type
annie entering pauls room carrying a chapter
handing him a cup of tea
paul this is positively the best misery youve ever written
i think youre right
the pile of paper
annie out by the barn
she stares in at the house
framed in the window is paul working
she smiles enters the barn
he stretches but only briefly then back to his typing
annie cooking happily away reading a chapter
paul arm out of the sling
he manages to lift the typewriter once sets it back down puts the sling back on
annie bringing a tray of food
i think its so wonderful that misery would sacrifice her title to take up the cause of her people
thats true nobility
paul hands her some new pages
as she exits buster in his office reading
he is alone
annie is reading by the fire
her pig misery sits beside her staring at the pages
his fingers just fly faster than hes ever typed and paul staring and the pile growing growing and paul ripping open a new ream of paper
his lips move silently
hes not even aware of it as he nods and
the paper in the typewriter line after line being written
pauls face at day night and dusk in rapid succession ending with lightning
giant deep rolls of thunder as rain begins
typewriter being lifted out of frame then back in then out again
the pile of manuscript has doubled
maybe two hundred pages
paul with some effort is pumping the typewriter up and down
finally he places it back down and puts his arm back in the sling
paul looking outside breifly
the sound hit s the roof of the house hits the window
annie lumbering in shes never looked like this shes wearing her slippers and her pink quilted housecoat
her eyes are without life
her hair loose and straggly hangs around her face
slowly like a robot she goes to paul who looks silently up at her
heres your pills
she drops them on the table
paul as the pills hit his chest and bounce into his lap
annie what is it
half turns away turns back gestures outside the rain
sometimes it gives me the blues
annie close up
and suddenly its as if shes been turned off gone lifeless
paul staring at her
no sound but the rain
annie seen straight on
no light in her eyes
when you first came here i only loved the writer part of paul sheldon
but now i know i love the rest of him too
as much as misery loves ian
beat i know you dont love me dont say you do youre a beautiful brilliant famous man of the world and im
not a movie star type
youll never know the fear of losing someone like you if youre someone like me
why would you lose me
the book is almost finished
your legs are getting better
soon youll be able to walk
youll be wanting to leave
why would i want to leave
i like it here
thats very kind of you but ill bet its not altogether true
she slowly reaches into the pocket of her bathrobe and pulls out a
i have this gun and sometimes i think about using it
she is absentmindedly clicking the empty gun
i better go now
i might put bullets in it
robot like she crosses to the door and leaves
as she closes and locks the door paul stunned listening waiting here is the sound of the front door closing then footsteps on the outside walk the sound of a
car door opening and slamming shut
now comes the gunning of the motor
the window as annie drives by hunched over the wheel
the motor sound grows fainter faint
buster and virginia are lying in bed
buster is reading yet another misery novel miserys trial
virginia is also reading
there is a justice higher than that of man
i will be judged by him
theyre hauling misery into court
mutters under his breath there is a justice higher than that of man i will be judged by him
the kitchen knives on the counter
paul now using both arms forcing his body up toward them
this isnt easy it was a bitch the first time he tried it but nothings going to stop him now
hes leaning against the cupboard using it for balance his balance starts to go but he wont let it as we the knives as his hand grabs the largest one
a fat handled sharp beauty and paul and you can sense the relief as he begins to lower himself to the floor
paul back in his wheelchair knife in his lap carefully opening drawers of little tables looking inside
he closes them moves on unmindful of the rain
now the shelf of paul sheldon books
as before except the my life scrapbook is gone
paul glancing around and there it is on a coffee table in the living room
also on the table are a roll of scotch tape a pair of scissors and a copy of newsweek
paul wheels toward the table and the book which is as big as a folio shakespeare play and as thick as a family bible
paul opening the book
the first page of the book as paul opens it
its a newspaper clipping as is almost all of what follows
a small article simply a birth announcement for anne marie wilkes
paul turns the page
this headline reads investment banker carl wilkes dies in freak fall
usc nursing student dies in freak fall
thats the headline on the next page
now miss wilkes is nursing school honors graduate
paul turns the page
manchester new hampshire union leader ernest gonyar dies after long illness
now that phrase seems to be what catches our eye after long illness is from the next article
long illness from the one after that
then on the next page a variation short illness
now were in pennsylvania new hospital staff announced
and here come those phrases again on page after page after long illness
after long illness
after long illness
paul transfixed he keeps on turning the pages the states keep changing moving west
pennsylvania to minnesota minnesota to north dakota
and always the clippings reporting deaths and deaths and and now were in colorado
new head maternity nurse named
and now the dead are young and helpless babies
more and more of them
stunned holy shit
then a headline which reads next page miss wilkes released
next page three more infants die
next page at last dragon lady arrested
then a photo the front page of the rocky mountain gazette
annie on the courthouse steps
dragon lady claims innocence under which there is a statement by annie wilkes
paul turns quickly to the next page and a very large headline paul just sits there shaking his head in bewilderment
the book as paul turns the last page
paul stunned and now we find out why as we the page in the book
its an article from newsweek magazine a picture of pauls car being hauled up out of the snow
above it this caption presumed dead paul sheldon
slamming the book shut putting it back on the coffee table then quickly turning his wheelchair as we paul steering his wheelchair toward the front door
he tries to position himself for a surprise attack of annie but he cant find a way to get close enough
the wheelchair is too cumbersome
he looks around and decides to head back to his room
he is faced with the same problem there so he struggles into bed and lying on his back he rests the knife on his chest and stares up at the
pauls window hours later
the rain has stopped
paul trying to stay awake
after a few beats he hears something
its the sound of a car pulling up
headlights can be seen flashing through the window
paul grips the knife and hides it under the covers
the sound of a car door opening and closing then footsteps
as the front door opens paul girds himself for attack
the front door closes then a couple of footsteps
then the footsteps continue down the hall and up the stairs
after a beat we hear the television
someone is explaining how you can buy millions of dollars of prime real estate with no money down
paul allowing himself to relax slips the knife under the mattress
as the tv drones on paul lies staring up at the ceiling
we hear a clap of thunder and once again the rain pours down
close up paul eyes closed
there is another loud thunderclap which causes paul to stir and open his eyes
he turns his head and another clap of thunder is heard lightning flashes and reveals annie standing over his bed
before he can react she jabs a needle into his arm pulls it out and starts out of the room
paul tries to raise himself but the power of the drug causes him to collapse unconscious
its stopped raining paul lies asleep
now surprisingly we hear a voice weve never heard in the movie before loud for an instant we dont recognize the voice then we do its liberace talking to his
audience on a record going thank you thank you what a wonderful thing it is for me to be back with you in paris
paul stirs and awakens to discover that he is strapped to his bed
he can move his arms but thats it
annie standing in the room and she looks very together her eyes are bright
way too bright
she comes to the foot of his bed
paul groggy from being drugged tries to clear the cobwebs
in a soft voice paul i know youve been out
youve been out of your room
no i havent
paul my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south
i dont know what youre talking about
paul looks up at her he is totally honest and sincere
as he talks his hand surreptitiously begins moving toward the mattress edge
annie as she brings the fat hand led knife out of her skirt pocket
is this what youre looking for
i know youve been out twice paul
at first i couldnt figure out how you did it but last night i found your key
she holds up the bobby pin i know i left my scrapbook out and i can imagine what you might be thinking of me
but you see paul its all okay
annie as she walks slowly back to the foot of the bed
and now a thump comes from the foot of the bed
something is out of sight
paul staring at her waiting
last night it came so clear
i realize you just need more time
eventually youll come to accept the idea of being here
paul do you know about the early days at the kimberly diamond mine
do you know what they did to the native workers who stole diamonds
dont worry they didnt kill them
that would be like junking a mercedes just because it had a broken spring no if they caught them they had to make sure they could go on working but
they also had to make sure they could never run away
the operation was called hobbling
and with that she reaches down out of sight and comes up holding a inch piece of x wood
annie whatever youre thinking about dont do it
she wedges the x firmly between his legs just above the ankles secures it and adjusts his feet
now dont fuss paul
why would i run away
im a writer annie its all i am and ive never written this well even you said that this is my best didnt you
annie picks up a sledgehammer
why would i leave a place where im doing my best work
it doesnt make any sense
annie positioning herself to the side of his right ankle
shh darling trust me taking aim at his ankle its for the best
she takes the sledgehammer back
annie for gods sake please
as annie swings the sledgehammer makes contact with the ankle
it breaks with a sharp crack
paul close up shrieking
annie moving to the other side of the bed
almost done just one more
and as she breaks the other ankle paul shrieks even louder
god i love you
he is beyond agony
for a long moment nothing
a faint sound
after a moment it begins to become more intrusive and we can tell what it is a car horn honking
silver creek and annie in her cherokee honking for another car to get a move on
a hand and a coin moving across it from finger to finger
buster sitting by the front window of his office reading the rocky mountain gazette
he watches idly as annie yells out the window to the car in front of her
the driver of the car yells back
annie yells louder
the driver guns off and annie pulls into the parking space next to the general store
annie getting out shaking a fist at the other car calling out you poop
she enters the store
buster staring straight ahead
something is gnawing at him
virginia in his office tidying the desk
buster enters looks angry
just leave it all right
oh i like that tone
how many times do i have to tell you i have a system here
rooting through a pile of papers where the hell is that thing
finding what hes looking for a x card here it is
right where its supposed to be
what is it
im not sure
its good you found it
theres that spice again
as buster leaves virginia goes back to tidying the desk
a large library as buster leaves his car hurries inside and buster wearing bifocals sits poring over bound volumes of the rocky mountain gazette
buster frustrated puts one set of volumes down picks up another starts through it as we the rocky mountain gazette as the pages turn
only now they stop moving
buster tense adjusting his bifocals
a series of headlines pertaining to annie wilkes murder trial
a headline which reads dragon lady claims innocence
under a picture of annie on the courthouse steps we see a caption wilkes told reporters on the courthouse steps there is a higher justice than that of man i
will be judged by him
he takes the x card out of his pocket
the card on it is printed the exact quote we just saw in the paper
buster sitting there staring at the quote
hold on his face then annie carrying a bag of feed followed by misery the sow comes into view
she slows smiles waves hi punkin
paul staring out at her
give us a smile
paul gives her the finger
she laughs such a kidder
as she exits our view paul lifting the typewriter and repeatedly raising it over his head this time without any difficulty
the place is empty
its one of those wonderful spots that stocks pretty much everything in what seems like complete disarray
buster goes to the coffee urn behind the counter helps himself
he speaks to the guy who sits behind the counter nearby these two have known each other forever
answer me a couple things
if i can
do you have any of those new paul sheldon books
we had a batch
sold em all in three days
you wouldnt happen to remember if miz wilkes bought one would you
are you kidding
every time that fella writes a book she makes me set aside the first copy
buster opens the cash register drops his coffee money inside closes the register
has she been buying any odd things lately
same old stuff
beat lest you call paper odd
mimes typing no the typing kind
nothing odd about that
he cannot hide his excitement now as we annie entering pauls room
he lies back in the wheelchair eyes closed
liberace music playing in the background
from the start pauls tone is different strong hes in control
paul dont you think its time for you to start writing again
its been over a week
i dont know its weird but a couple of broken bones hasnt done a lot for my creative juices
get the fuck out of here
dont talk to me like that
staring at her now why what are you going to do
spreading his arms wide kill me
take your best shot
taken aback why are you so mean mister youd be dead in the snow if it wasnt for me
oh no reason you keep me prisoner you make me burn my book you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles
ill drive a sledgehammer into your man gland if youre not nicer he spreads his legs be my guest
after a beat thats disgusting
as she exits
hold for a moment now a car appears around a curve
buster is driving fast
paul in his room
he sits as before by the window
he doesnt move
now he closes his eyes stretches sighs as we annie busily making cocoa
buster in his car
he stops at a mailbox
the name on the box is wilkes
buster turns his car slowly into the driveway by the mailbox
he yawns opens his eyes briefly
in the distance now growing more and more visible is busters car and now pauls eyes go open wide and hes staring out the window at the car as it
keeps on coming closer closer and buster looking around
hes driving very slowly carefully
fixating on the window and now its all going to be all right everythings going to be all right and then annie is on him hypodermic needle in hand jabbing
it into his arm
he desperately tries to fight her off but the drug starts to take hold
he tries to grab her by the neck but she fights him off as she wheels him out of the room down the hall and towards the cellar door
i dont think ill ever understand you
i cook your meals i tend to you practically twenty four hours a day and you continue to fight me
when are we going to develop a sense of trust
annie opens the cellar door
paul is all but limp by now
as she picks him up and starts to carry him down the steps buster pulling up in front of the house
as he gets out of his car annie placing paul on the cellar floor and heading up the stairs
paul is out
buster heading up the steps to the front door
annie stashing the wheelchair in the hall closet
she crosses to the front door opens it revealing buster
gasping oh my
sorry didnt mean to startle you
you didnt give me a chance to knock
all charm guess you can tell from my reaction im not all that used to visitors out here
what can i do for you
i was just wondering if you happen to know anything about paul sheldon
stammering what do you want to know
anything you can tell me might help
the words pour out well he was born in worcester massachusetts forty two years ago the only child of franklin and helene sheldon mediocre student majored in history
buster watching her surprised
cutting in excuse me thats not exactly the kind of information i was after
you see hes been missing for quite some time now and
its so upsetting
im his number one fan
ive got all his books every sentence he ever put down
im so proud of my paul sheldon collection
stops suddenly almost embarrassed here i am prattling on and my manners have just flown away
i havent invited you in
annie lets buster in closes the door
they linger in front of pauls door
buster idly checks out the hallway
course you must know about that horrible accident
buster nods and wanders into the living room
he crosses into the study and checks out a bookcase that contains the complete works of paul sheldon
one shelf below contains annies infamous scrapbook
almost killed me too
i prayed when i heard the news
i got down on my knees and begged for it not to be true
shes so moved
buster wanders into the kitchen
youre going to laugh at what im about to say but go ahead i dont care
beat when i was praying god told me to get ready
buster watching her
this isnt at all what he expected
get ready for what
paul trying to fight the drug just his eyes flutter
annie and buster heading back down the hallway toward pauls room
to try and be his replacement he gave so much pleasure to so many people and theres a shortage of pleasure on this planet these days in case you hadnt
buster enters pauls room
god told me since i was his number one fan that i should make up new stories as if i was paul sheldon
so went to town
and i bought a typewriter
and paper to type on
the same kind paul sheldon used
and i turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio
would you like to see it
its right this way
buster takes a look in the bathroom
annie waits for him
its right here
i knew how he wrote the kinds of words he used the wonderful stories he told moved ive spent the last four weeks trying to write like paul sheldon
sad shake of the head but i cant do it right
i try and i try and i know all the words eyes closed in despair but its just not the same
he just stands there watches her
long pause maybe it takes time to get the hang of it
holding up pages from the manuscript i could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine and you could tell me what you think
im not much of a critic
well i just thought oh look at me
youd think id never had a house guest before
would you like something to drink
how does a nice cup of cocoa sound
as she exits into the kitchen
theres some already made
buster lingers in pauls room for a beat then goes into the hallway
must get lonely living out here all by yourself
i always say if you cant enjoy your own company youre not fit company for anyone else
you got a point there
as buster moves up the stairs paul still fighting the drug
his arm twitches almost involuntarily grazing the barbecue
buster opening the door to annies room
he looks around and just as he is about to turn to leave annie standing right in front of him
here you are
buster heads down the stairs annie follows
thanks miz wilkes but i dont want to take up any more of your time
i best be going
but you didnt even taste your cocoa
they cross to the front door
im sure its wonderful but really should be getting back
buster opens the door
buster and annie at the door
if you dont mind perhaps i could pay you another visit sometime
id be delighted
now that you know the way
with that she closes the door
we stay with buster
he stands on the front porch for a beat thinking then starts heading down the porch steps
just as he reaches about halfway down we hear a loud crash coming from inside the house
paul he has managed to partially fight his way through the drug and in waking has accidentally knocked over the barbecue
he fights to clear the cobwebs
miz wilkes are you all right
there is no answer
he quietly moves into the house
again no answer
paul still fighting to gain complete consciousness
im down here
hearing pauls muffled call for help he tracks the sound to the cellar door
as paul continues to call out buster looks around sees no one and opens the cellar door
the shaft of light from the open door pours down on paul who is still lying on the floor
but before paul can answer theres the sound of a loud explosion
seemingly from nowhere a hole is ripped through busters chest knocking him out of frame revealing annie smoking shotgun in hand standing at the top of the cellar steps
dont feel bad paul
it had to happen
ive been waiting for this sign
annie walks toward busters body and very casually takes his gun out of its holster
ive known for some time why i was chosen to save you
you and i were meant to be together forever
but now our time in this world must end
but dont worry paul
ive already prepared for what must be done
i put two bullets in my gun one for you and one for me
oh darling it will be so beautiful
with that annie turns and exits the cellar
pauls mind races desperately
he looks at the barbecue again
next to it is a messy table with a dozen jars and cans on it
one of the cans is lighter fluid
he stares at it for a moment
an idea hits him now paul struggles and crawls over to the table
he grabs the lighter fluid in his hands jams it into the rear of his pants and scrambles back to where annie left him
annie returning with her
special and a hypodermic needle
she stops at the top of the stairs
now dont be afraid
i love you
she starts toward him
i know you do
i love you too annie
this stops her and youre right
we are meant to be together
and i know we must die
but it must be so that misery can live
we have the power to give misery eternal life
we must finish the book
but the time is now
soon others will come
its almost done
by dawn well be able to give misery back to the world
annie stares at paul
she could go either way on this
then without a word she turns and goes back up the stairs
ill fix you something to eat
paul hesitates for a moment then realizes he has no choice
he starts dragging himself over buster and up the stairs
typing like a madman totally concentrated on the white paper
his lips move but hes not even aware of it
annie enters quietly holding a few pages
three more chapters to go
she looks at him now enthralled
the stranger staying at the inn is he someone from miserys past
this is so exciting
its windthorne her first love right
are you ready for the next chapter
he taunts her with it
brimming with enthusiasm oh you
she takes the pages and goes
paul types a moment then rips out the page and starts over
annie putting the coffee down for him putting the pages back on the main pile
more excited now than the last time it was windthorne
i knew it what does that do to her love for ian
thinks of course if she hadnt thought windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with ian in the first place
paul glares at her she turns to the door sorry its just that this is so wonderful
im glad you like it
paul this will be our legacy
he hands her a few more pages she starts reading as she exits
paul rubs his eyes
for a moment he sags but he fights it
he puts a clean page into the typewriter
annie bursts in
does she wind up with ian or windthorne
you have to tell me
youll know very soon
im starting the last chapter
and when i finish i want everything to be perfect
ill require three things
you dont know
smiling i was fooling silly
ticking them off you need a cigarette because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book and you just have one and the match is
to light it
and you need one glass of champagne
thinks dome pear igg non
dome pear igg non it is
as annie exits
the first light of morning is starting to break through
he makes sure everything is set
calling out annie
with that she enters
im almost done
oh paul this is so romantic
ian and windthorne dueling for the right to miserys hand
does ian win
oh dont me
its windthorne right
youll know everything in a minute
get the champagne
dying from the suspense ahh
she exits paul adjusts the manuscript on the table and then types the last line
annie in the kitchen
she takes the bottle of dom perignon out of the icebox places it on a tray with two glasses opens a drawer takes out the gun places it in her
pocket then takes out the hypodermic needle and places it on the tray
annie enters with the tray
she sets it down on the table
did i do good
you did perfect
except for one thing
this time we need two glasses
he takes the last page out of the typewriter
as soon as she exits paul drops the manuscript to the floor pulls the lighter fluid from his pants and starts dousing the manuscript with lighter fluid
he grabs the last chapter and twists the last few pages together torch style
he douses it with the fluid and holds the match out of sight
he smiles as we annie entering with the second glass
its all right here annie
remember how for all those years no one ever knew who miserys real father was or if theyd ever be reunited
its all right here
will misery finally lead her countrymen to freedom
does she finally marry ian or will it be windthorne
its all right here
the match as he strikes it and annie screaming paul you cant
and as her hands fly out beseechingly the champagne bottle it falls to the floor explodes like a torpedo shards of glass all over curds of foam everywhere why not
i learned it from you
and on that the last chapter as paul brings the match close to it and it bursts into flame
and paul holding it like the torch it is
annie starts moving forward now
no no not misery not my misery
he drops the last chapter into the soaked manuscript and the manuscript as kaboom
it bursts into flame and annie transfixed by the sight for a moment and then she charges
the fire as annie rushes to the book stoops down grabs it with both hands brings the burning mass up to her body both arms across it trying to smother
the flames paul grabbing the typewriter raising it high above his head then throwing it down on her with all his power and the typewriter crashing into the back of her head
annie screaming driven to the floor by the blow the book beneath her and the flames fly up her sweater is starting to burn and shes covered with shards of
glass from the shattered bottle of champagne and some of the manuscript is hissing from the liquid but she is able to struggle to her knees im going to kill you you lying cocksucker
as she struggles to her feet she pulls out the gun and shoots at paul hitting him in the shoulder
just as shes about to shoot again paul quickly wheels the chair up to her throws himself out of the chair and tackles her
the gun flies out of her hand and lands in the hallway going off as it lands
they wrestle on the floor
flames still around them paul gets on top of her grabs some burning pages stuffs them into her mouth shouting here
you want it
you want it
you can eat it eat it eat it till you fucking choke you sick twisted fuck
and as he forces more paper into her mouth annie and shes hideous blistered her hands claw at her throat
she makes horrible sounds spitting the charred chunks of manuscript out of her mouth
shards of glass are in her hair
now a shriek and a tremendous jerk of her body and paul falling away annie still making the sounds as she gets to her feet and paul trying to crawl
away after her
annie heading for the door she takes a step away from paul then another then paul suddenly kicking out with his shattered leg screaming in pain as it crashes into
her ankle and annie trying to keep her balance not doing well her arms windmilling as she fights for balance one last moment fights and loses and now as she topples over the typewriter as she falls and her head slams into it collides with the sharp metal and a great wound opens in her head
there is one final cry
we are looking at a dead body
paul exhausted panting lying there trying to gather his energy
he starts to crawl for the door
just as he reaches the doorjamb an arm grabs his leg and paul shrieking and annie pulling herself up his body and paul trying to buck her off but he
cant and annie the stronger relentless moving up on him and paul his grip broken as he turns and annie all powerful looming over him and paul hitting up at her and annie swelling and the blood pours down and if she feels his blows she doesnt show it and paul whatever energy he has left he uses now trying to twist and strike and as his body moves metal based floor lamp and paul grabbing the thing suddenly bringing it across his body clobbering annie in the face and annie startled by the power of the blow and for a moment she is stopped and paul as with everything he has left he crunches her forehead with the sharp heavy metal base just creams her as the air is forced out of her annie
her eyes roll up into her head
for a moment all we see are the whites then she collapses on paul a motionless mountain of slack flesh
paul scrambling free pushing her off him crawling for the door outside the door as paul crawls into view makes it to the corridor reaches back closes the door locks
safe he collapses exhausted against the wall opposite the door
it is dawn
he is awakened by a loud smashing at the front door
after a couple of heart stopping pounds the front door smashes open revealing two cops with guns drawn
the policemen hurrying to paul
the younger cop kneels beside paul
its the writer the dead one trying to keep himself together right
im the dead one wheres sheriff mccain
hes in the cellar
she killed him
shes in there
the older cop taking the key to the room unlocks the door throws it open and as he steps inside the older cop has his gun ready to fire but
even with it tight in his hand hes edgy as hell
he looks around glass and bloodstains on the floor
the charred remains of a manuscript
he kneels quickly glances under the bed nothing
he looks at the window wide open
paul and the younger cop
the older cop is in the doorway now
theres no one in there
paul close up
this legend appears one year later marcia sindell is seated at a table
paul enters walking briskly and hes never looked this good before
hes gained his weight back his color is normal again
he appears to be for the first time in the movie a jaunty happy figure
sorry im late
jennys basketball game went into overtime
if anybody ever told me id have a daughter whod get a triple double id
did they win
theyre in the semis
here it is
big moment very first copy
and she hands him a wrapped package
paul sits begins unwrapping it
its a book
a new one by paul sheldon
the higher education of j
paul turns it over gently in his hands
the word im getting is the times review is gonna be a love letter
thatd be a first
and my contacts at time and newsweek tell me theyre both raves
and dont laugh for the first time i think youve got a shot at some prizes
i thought youd be thrilled
youre being taken seriously
im delighted the critics are liking it and i hope the people like it too
but its not why i wrote the book
paul close up
there is a genuine sense of peace about him
he has been through the fire and survived
i like it
remember how you once said i live my whole life as if im in danger of being found out
well i believe ive managed to get that guy down on paper
he touches the book
dont think im completely nuts but in some way annie wilkes that whole experience helped me
paul since you brought her up i have to ask you this or id be drummed out of the agents union what about a non fiction book
the truth about what went on in that house
gee marcia if i didnt know you better id think you were suggesting i dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks
now youve hurt me paul
as paul glances around
paul looking past marcia
dessert trolley some distance away being pushed by a waitress
it is annie
i thought you were over it
well maybe not completely he glances toward the trolley
the dessert trolley moving inexorably closer to paul
annie reaches down and pulls out a very sharp knife
i dont know if you can ever be totally over something like that i just dont think about it as much anymore and when i do its not so terrifying
annie with the knife raised
paul staring up at annie
i mean once they found her body my nightmares stopped
paul and annie only it isnt annie just a waitress
she stands by the trolley the knife in her hand ready to slice whatever anyone wants
would you care for anything
smiles cut me something sinful
the smile holds
in the background now soft music someone might be playing liberace
