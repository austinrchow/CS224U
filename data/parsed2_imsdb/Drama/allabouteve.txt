href b b all about eve it is not a large room and jammed with tables mostly for four but some for six and eight
a long table of honor for about thirty people has been placed upon a dais
diner is over
demi tasses cigars and brandy
the overall effect is one of worn elegance and dogged gentility
it is june
the camera as it has been throughout the credit titles is on the sarah siddons award
it is a gold statuette about a foot high of sarah siddons as the tragic muse
exquisitely framed in a nest of flowers it rests on a miniature altar in the center of the table of honor
over this we hear the crisp cultured precise voice of addison dewitt the sarah siddons award for distinguished achievement is perhaps unknown to you
it has been spared the sensational and commercial publicity that attends such questionable honors as the pulitzer prize and those awards presented annually by the film society
the camera has eased back to include some of the table of honor and a distinguished gentleman with snow white hair who is speaking
we do not hear what he says
the distinguished looking gentleman is an extremely old actor
being an actor he will go on speaking for some time
it is not important what you hear what he says
the camera eases back some more and continues until it discloses a fairly comprehensive shot of the room however it is important that you know where you are and why
you are here
this is the dining room of the sarah siddons society
the occasion is its annual banquet and presentation of the highest honor our theater knows the sarah siddons award for distinguished achievement
a group of waiters are clustered near the screen masking the entrances of the kitchen
the screens are papered with old theatrical programs
the waiters are all aged and venerable
they look respectfully toward the speaker
these hollowed walls indeed many of these faces have looked upon modjeska ada rehan and minnie fiske mansfields voice filled the room booth breathed this air
it is unlikely that the windows have been opened since his death
close the award on its altar it shines proudly above five or six smaller altars which surround it and which are now empty
the minor awards as you can see have already been presented
minor awards are for such as the writer and director since their function is merely to construct a tower so that the world can applaud a light which flashes on
top of it and no brighter light has ever dazzled the eye than eve harrington
but more of eve later
all about eve in fact
the camera moves to close addison dewitt not young not unattractive a fastidious dresser sharp of eye and merciless of tongue
an omnipresent cigarette holder projects from his mouth like the sward of dartagnan
he sits back in his chair musingly his fingers making little cannonballs out of bread crumbs
his narration covers the move of the camera to him to those of you who do not read attend the theater listen to uncensored radio programs or know anything of
the world in which we live it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself
my name is addison dewitt
my native habitat is the theater in it i toil not neither do i spin
i am a critic and commentator
i am essential to the theater as ants are to a picnic as the ball weevil to a cotton field
he looks to his left
karen richards is lovely and thirtyish in an unprofessional way
she is scraping bread crumbs spilled sugar etc
into a pile with a spoon
addison takes one of her bread crumbs
she smiles absently
addison rolls the bread crumb into a cannonball
this is karen richards
she is the wife of a playwright therefore of the theater by marriage
nothing in her background or breeding should have brought her any closer the stage than row e center
karen continues her doodling
however during her senior year in radcliffe lloyd richards lectured on drama
the following year karen became mrs
lloyd is the author of footsteps on the ceiling the play which has won for eve harrington the sarah siddons award
karen absently pats the top of her little pile of refuse
a hand reaches in to take the spoon away
karen looks as the camera pans with it to max fabian
he sits at her left
hes a sad faced man with glasses and a look of constant apprehension
he smiles apologetically and indicated a white powder with he unwraps
he pantomimes that his ulcer is snapping
karen smiles back returns to her doodling
addison mashes a cigarette stub pops it out of his holder
he eyes max
there are two types of theatrical producers
one has a great many wealthy friends who will risk a tax deductible loss
this type is interested in art
max drops the powder into some water stirs it drinks burps delicately and close his eyes
the other is one to whom each production mean potential ruin or fortune
this type is out to make a buck
meet max fabian
he is the producer of the play which has won eve harrington the sarah siddons award
max rests fitfully
a hand reaches into the scene removes a bottle of scotch from before him
the camera follows the bottle to margo channing
she sits at maxs left at dewitts right
an attractive strong face
she is childish adult reasonable unreasonable usually one when she should be the other but always positive
she pours a stiff drink
addison hold out the soda bottle to her
she looks at it and at him as if it were a tarantula and he had gone mad
he smiles and pours a glass of soda for himself
margo channing is the star of the theater
she made her first stage appearance at the age of four in midsummer nights dream
she played a fairy and entered quite unexpectedly stark naked
she has been a star ever since
margo sloshes her drink around moodily pulls at it
margo is a great star
a true star
she never was or will be anything less or anything less
slight pause the part for which eve harrington is receiving the sarah siddons award was intended originally for margo channing
addison having sipped his soda water puts a new cigarette in his holder leans back lights it looks and exhales in the general direction of the table of honor
as he speaks the camera moves in the direction of his glance
having covered in tedious detail not only the history of the sarah siddons society but also the history of acting since thespis first stepped out of the chorus line our
distinguished chairman has finally arrived at our reason for being here
at this point addisons voice fades out and the voice of the aged actor fades in
camera is in medium close shot of him and the podium
i have been proud and privileged to have spent my life in the theater a poor player
that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and i have been honored to be for forty years chief promoter of the sarah siddons society
he lifts the sarah siddons award from its altar thirty nine times have i placed in deserving hands this highest honor the theater knows
he grows a bit arch he uses his eyebrows surely no actor is older than i i have earned my place out of the sun
indulgent laughter and never before has this award gone to anyone younger than its recipient tonight
how fitting that it should pass from my hands to hers
eve hands lovely beautifully groomed
in serene repose they rest between a demi tasse cup and an exquisite small evening cup
such young hands
such a young lady
young in years but whose heart is as old as the theater
addisons eyes narrow quizzically as he listens
then slowly he turns to look at karen
some of us a privileged to know her
we have seen beyond the beauty and artistry karen never ceases her thoughtful pat a cake with the crumbs
that have made her name resound through the nation
we know her humility
her devotion her loyalty to her art
addisons glance moves from karen to margo
her love her deep and abiding love for us margos face is a mask
she looks down at the drink which she cradles with both hands
for what we are and what we do
she has had one wish one prayer one dream
to belong to us
hes nearing his curtain line tonight her dream has come true
and henceforth we shall dream the same of her
a slight pause honored members ladies and gentlemen for distinguished achievement in the theater the sarah siddons award to miss eve harrington
the entire room is galvanized into sudden and tumultuous applause
some enthusiastic gentlemen rise to her feet
flash bulbs start popping about halfway down the table of the aged actors left
eve rises beautiful radiant poised exquisitely gowned
she stands in simple and dignified response to the ovation
a dozen photographers skip squat and dart about like water bugs
flash bulbs pop and pop and pop
the waiters applaud enthusiastically
aged actor award in hand he beams at her
eve smiles sweetly to her left then to her right
max has come to
he applauds lustily
addisons applauding too more discreetly
margo not applauding
but you sense no deliberate slight merely an impression that as she looks at eve her mind is on something else
karen nor is she applauding
but her gaze is similarly fixed on eve in a strange faraway fashion
addison still applauding his eyes flash first at margo and then at karen
then he directs them back to eve
he smiles ever so slightly
the applause has continued unabated
eve turns now and moves gracefully toward the aged actor
she moves through applauding ladies and gentlemen from below the flash bulbs keep popping
as she nears her goal the ages actor turns to her
he holds out the award
her hand reaches out for it
at that precise moment with the award just beyond her fingertips the picture holds the action stops
the sound stops
eve the golden girl
the cover girl the girl next door the girl on the moon
time has been good to eve life goes where she goes shes been profiled covered revealed reported what she eats and when and where whom she knows and where she
was and when and where shes going
addison has stopped applauding hes sitting forward staring intently at eve
his narration continues unbroken
you all know all about eve
what can there be to know that you dont know
as he leans back the applause fades in as tumultuous as before
addisons look moves slowly from eve to karen
karen she leans forward now her eyes intently on eve
her lovely face fills the screen as the applause fades once more as she thinks back when was it
it seems a lifetime ago
lloyd always said that in the theater a lifetime was a season and a season a lifetime
its june now
that was early october
only last october
it was a drizzly night i remember i asked the taxi to wait
traffic is not heavy the shows have broken some half hour before
the rain is just a drizzle
there are other theaters on the street display lights are being extinguished
going out just as karens taxi pulls up is margo channing in aged in wood
the marquis display below includes max fabian presents and by lloyd richards
the taxi comes to a stop at the alley
karen can be seen through the closed windows telling the driver to wait
then she gets out
she takes a step hesitates then looks about curiously where was she
i had become so accustomed to seeing her there night after night i found myself looking for a girl id never spoken to wondering where she was
she smiles a little at her own romanticism puts her head down and makes her way into the alley
karen moves toward the stage door
she passes a recess in the wall perhaps an exit about halfway
karen hesitates looks
eve is barely distinguishable in the shadow of the recess
karen smiles waits
eve comes out
a gooseneck light above them reveals her
she wears a cheap trench coat low heeled shoes a rain hat stuck on the back of her head
her large luminous eyes seem to glow up at karen in the strange half light
so there you are
it seemed odd suddenly your not being there
why should you think i wouldnt be
why should you be
after all six nights a week for weeks of watching even margo channing enter and leave a theater i hope you dont mind my speaking to you
not at all
ive seen you so often it took every bit of courage i could raise smiles to speak to just a playwrights wife
im the lowest form of celebrity
youre margo channings best friend
you and your husband are always with her and mr
whats he like
grins bill sampson
hes hes a director
hes the best
hell agree with you
tell me what do you between the time margo goes in and comes out
just huddle in that doorway and wait
i see the play
incredulous you see the play
youve seen the play every performance
eve nods but dont you find it i mean apart from everything else dont you find it expensive
standing room doesnt cost much
karen contemplates eve
then she takes her arm
im going to take you to margo
hanging back oh no
shes got to meet you no id be imposing on her id be just another tongue tied gushing fan
karen practically propels her toward the stage door
insisting there isnt another like you there couldnt be but if id known
maybe some other time
i mean looking like this
you look just fine
theyre at the stage door by the way
whats your name
karen opens the door
they go in
everything including the doorman looks fireproof
eve enters like a novitiates first visit to the vatican
karen with a good evening gus to the doorman leads the way toward margos stage dressing room
eve drinking in the wonderment of all the surveys lags behind
karen waits for her to catch up
you can breathe it cant you
like some magic perfume
karen smiles takes eves arm
they proceed to margos dressing room
no star on the closed door the paint is peeling
a type written chit thumbtacked says miss channing
as karen and eve approach it an uninhibited guffaw from margo makes them pause
whispers you wait a minute
smiles now dont run away eve smiles shakily
at the same moment loudly through the door honey chile i said if the south had won the war you could write the same plays about the north
karen enters during the line
it is a medium sized box lined with hot water pipes and cracked plaster
it is furnished in beat up wicker
a door leads to an old fashioned bathroom
margo is at the dressing table
she wears an old wrapper her hair drawn back tightly to fit under the wig which lies before her like a dead poodle
also before her is an almost finished drink
lloyd richards is stretched out on the wicker chaise
hes in his late thirties sensitive literate
between them by the dressing table is birdie margos maid
her age is unimportant
she was conceived during a split week in walla walla and born in a carnival riot
she is fiercely loyal to margo
karen enters during the line margo started while she was outside
lloyd chuckles birdie cackles
she goes to kiss lloyd hello darling hi
she goes right on in a think suthn accent well now mis channin ah dont think you can rightly say we lost the wah we was mo stahved out you
might say an thats what ah don unnerstand about all these plays about love stahved suthn women love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the south
how was the concert
lemme fix you a drink
no thanks birdie
karen laughs with them
margos interview with a lady reporter from the south the minute it gets printed theyre gonna fire on gettysburg all over again
it was fort sumter they fired on i never played fort sumter
she takes the wig into the bathroom
margo starts creaming the make up off her face
honey chili had a point
you know i can remember plays about women even from the south where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers
that was way back
within your time buster
lloyd honey be a playwright with guts
write me one about a nice normal woman who shoots her husband
birdie comes out of the bathroom without the wig
you need new girdles
the same size
i guess a real tight girdle help when youre playin a lunatic
she picks up lloud empty glass asks more
he shakes his head
she pours herself a quick one
firmly margo does not play a lunatic birdie
she just keeps hearin her dead father play the banjo
its the tight girdle that does it
i find these wisecracks increasingly less funny
aged in wood happens to be a fine and distinguished play ats my loyal little woman
the critics thought so the audiences certainly think so packed houses tickets for months in advance i cant see that either of lloyds last two plays have hurt you any
grins relax kid
its only me and my big mouth
mollified its just that you get me so mad sometimes
of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about dryly aint it the truth
yes it is
youre talented famous wealthy people waiting around night after night just to see you even in the wind and rain
theyre not people those little beast who run in packs like coyotes theyre your fans your audience theyre nobodys fans
theyre juvenile delinquents mental detectives theyre nobodys audience they never see a play or a movie even theyre never indoors long enough
there is a pause
lloyd applauds lightly
theres one indoors now
ive brought her back to see you
in a whisper shes just outside the door
to birdie also a whisper the heave ho
karen stops her
its all in whisper now until eve comes in
you cant put her out i promised
margo youve got to see her she worships you its like something out of a book that book is out of print karen those days are gone
fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches
if youd only see her youre her whole life you must have spotted her by now shes always there
kind of mousy trench coat and funny hat
karen nods how could i miss her
every night and matinee well
she looks to birdie
once george jessel played my hometown
for a girl gettin in to see him was easy
gettin out was the problem
they all laugh
karen goes to the door opens it
eve comes in
karen closes the door behind her
simply i thought youd forgotten about me
not at all
her arm through eves margo this is eve harrington
margo changes swiftly into a first lady of the theater manner
musically how do you do my dear
mutters oh brother
hello miss channing
nicely hello miss harrington
how do you do mr
graciously and this is my good friend and companion miss birdie coonan
to birdie oh brother what
when she gets like this
all of a sudden shes playin hamlets mother
quiet menace im sure you must have things to do in the bathroom birdie dear
if i havent ill find something till youre normal
she goes into the bathroom
wont you sit down miss worthington
im so sorry
wont you sit down
a short lull
would you like a drink
its right beside you
i was telling margo and lloyd about how often youd seen the play
they start together and stop in deference to each other
theyre a little flustered
but not eve
to margo no thank you
to lloyd yes
ive seen every performance
delighted every performance
then am i safe in assuming you like it
id like anything miss channing played
beams would you really
how sweet flatly i doubt very much that youd like her in the hairy ape
please dont misunderstand me mr
i think that part of miss channings greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays
your new play is for miss channing isnt it mr
of course it is
howd hear about it
there was an item in the times
i like the title
footsteps on the ceiling
lets get back to this one
have you really seen every performance
eve nods why
eve looks at margo then drops her eyes
if i didnt come to see the play i wouldnt have anywhere else to go
there are other plays
not with you in them
not by mr
but you must have friends a family a home eve pauses
then shakes her head
tell us about it eve
eve looks at her grateful because karen called her eve
then away again
if i only knew how
birdie comes out of the bathroom
everybody looks at her sharply
she realizes shes in on something important
she closes the door quietly leans against it
it started with the play before this one
did you see it here in new york
it was the last week
i went one night
the most important night in my life until this one
i found myself going the next night and the next and the next
then when the show went east i went east
ill never forget that blizzard the night we played cheyenne
a cold night
first time i ever saw a brassiere break like a piece of matzos
eve looks at her unsmilingly then back to her hands
why dont you start at the beginning
it couldnt possibly interest you
eve speaks simply and without self pity
i guess it started back home
wisconsin that is
there was just mum and dad and me
i was the only child and i made believe a lot when i was a kid i acted out all sorts of things
what they were isnt important
but somehow acting and make believe began to fill up my life more and more it got so that i couldnt tell the real from the unreal except that the
unreal seemed more real to me
im talking a lot of gibberish arent i
not at all
farmers were poor in those days thats what dad was a farmer
i had to help out
so i quit school and i went to milwaukee
i became a secretary
in a brewery
she smiles when youre a secretary in a brewery its pretty hard to make believe youre anything else
everything is beer
it wasnt much fun but it helped at home and there was a little theater group
like a drop of rain in the desert
thats where i met eddie
he was a radio technician
we played liliom for three performances i was awful then the war came and we got married
eddie was in the air force and they sent him to the south pacific
you were with the o
werent you mr
lloyd nods thats what whos who says
well with eddie gone my life went back to beer
except for a letter a week
one week eddie wrote he had a leave coming up
id saved my money and vacation time
i went to san francisco to meet him
a slight pause eddie wasnt there
they forwarded the telegram from milwaukee the one that came from washington to say that eddie wasnt coming at all
that eddie was dead
karen puts her hand on lloyds so i figured id stay in san francisco
i was alone but couldnt go back without eddie
i found a job
and his insurance helped
and there were theaters in san francisco
and one night margo channing came to play in remembrance
and i went to see it
and well here i am
she finishes dry eyes and self composed
margo squeezes the bridge of her nose dabs at her eyes
finally what a story
everything but the bloodhounds snappin at her rear end
that breaks the spell
margo turns to her there are some human experiences birdie that do not take place in a vaudeville house and that even a fifth rate vaudevillian should understand and respect
to eve i want to apologize for birdies snaps in you dont have to apologize for me
to eve im sorry if i hurt your feelings
its just my way of talkin
nicely you didnt hurt my feelings miss coonan
call me birdie
to margo as for bein fifth rate i closed the first half for eleven years an you know it
she slams into the bathroom again
at that precise instant bill sampson flings open the door to the dressing room
hes youngish vital undisciplined
he lugs a beat up suitcase which he drops as he crosses to margo forty five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do i find you
not ready yet looking like a junk yard thank you so much
is it sabotage does my career mean nothing to you
have you no human consideration
show me a human and i might have
conscious of eve bill
the air lines have clocks even if you havent
i start shooting a week from monday zanuck is impatient he wants me he needs me
louder bill zanuck zanuck zanuck
what are you two lovers
bill grins suddenly drops to one knee beside her
smiling only in some ways
im a junk yard
vaguely to karen huh
this is eve harrington
bill flashes a fleeting look at eve
to margo my wonderful junk yard
the mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard kisses him heaven help me i love a psychotic
bill grins rises sees eve as if for the first time
hello whats your name
youve already met
a minute ago
she too is a great admirer of yours
all this admiration in just one room
take your mistress into the bathroom and dress her
birdie opens her mouth without comment
birdie shuts it and goes into the bathroom
in a moment we hear a shower start to run
eve gets up
youre not going are you
i think id better
its been well i can hardly find the words to say how its been
rises no dont go
the four of you must have so much to say to each other with mr
margo impulsively crosses to eve
tell you what well put stanislavsky on his plane you and i then go somewhere and talk
well if im not in the way
i wont be a minute
she darts into the bathroom
eve sits down again
lloyd weve got to go lloyd gets up
karen crosses to pound on the bathroom door
she yells the shower is going
margo good night
ill call you tomorrow
margos answer is lost in the shower noise
karen crosses to kiss bill
shes joined by lloyd
good luck genius
geniuses dont need good luck
he grins i do
im not worried about you
keep the thought
they shake hands warmly
karen and lloyd move to eve
good night eve
i hope i see you again soon ill be at the old stand tomorrow matinee not just that way
as a friend
id like that
its been a real pleasure eve
i hope so mr
lloyd shakes her hand crosses to join karen who waits at the open dressing room door
karen and lloyd look back ill never forget this night as long as i live
and ill never forget you for making it possible
karen smiles warmly
she closes the door
and ill never forget you eve
where were we going that night lloyd and i
funny the things you remember and the things you dont
eve sits on the same chair
bill keeps moving around
eve never takes her eyes off him
he offers her a cigarette
she shakes her head
he looks at his watch
you said forty seven minutes
youll never make it
grins i told you a lie
well make it easily
margos got no more conception of time than a halibut
he goes to the dressing table picks up margos pocketbook opens it
he finds a letter
he glances at it puts it back
shes been carrying that letter around for weeks
ive read it three times
theres a sudden sharp yelp from the bathroom
youre supposed to zip the zipper not me
like tryin to zip a pretzel stand still
what a documentary those two would make
like the mongoose and the cobra he sprawls on the chaise closes his eyes
finally so youre going to hollywood
bill grunts in the affirmative
i just wondered
just wondered what
why you have to go out there
i dont have to
i want to
is it the money
eighty percent of it will go for taxes
why if youre the best and most successful young director in the theater the theatuh the theatuh he sits up what book of rules says the theater exists only within
some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of new york city
or london paris or vienna
he gets up listen junior
want to know what the theater is
a flea circus
also rodeos carnivals ballets indian tribal dances punch and judy a one man band all theater
wherever theres magic and make believe and an audience theres theater
donald duck ibsen and the lone ranger sarah bernhardt poodles hanneford lunt and fontanne betty grable rex and wild and eleanora duse
you dont understand them all you dont like them all why should you
the theaters for everybody you included but not exclusively so dont approve or disapprove
it may not be your theater but its theater of somebody somewhere
i just asked a simple question
grins and i shot my mouth off
nothing personal junior no offense
he sits back down its just that theres so much bushwah in this ivory green room they call the theatuh sometimes it gets up around my chin
he lies down again
you mustnt stay there
he closes his eyes its only one picture deal
so few come back
they keep you under drugs out there with armed guards
i read george jean nathan every week
also addison dewitt
you didnt have to tell me
margo putting on an earring buzzes out of the bathroom followed by birdie
bill sits up
en route i understand its the latest thing just one earring
if it isnt its going to be i cant find the other
she grabs her pocketbook starts rummaging
out comes the letter
throw that dreary thing away it bores me margo drops it in the wastebasket keeps rummaging
concerned where do you suppose it could be
itll show up
gives up oh well
to birdie look through the wigs maybe it got caught real diamonds in a wig
the world we live in
shes been looking wheres my coat
right where you left it
she goes behind the chaise
she comes up with a magnificent mink
to margo the seams
margo starts to straighten them
to eve cant keep his eyes off my legs
like a nylon lemon peel straightens up byron couldnt have said it more graciously
here we go by now shes in the coat and has eves arm heading for the door
bill puts his arms around birdie
got any messages
what do you want me to tell tyrone power
just give him my phone number ill tell him myself
bill kisses her cheek
she kisses bill
kill the people
to margo got your key
nods see you home
margo and eve precede bill out of the door
american airlines baggage counter
the rain has stopped but its wet
margo eve and bill are stymied behind two or three couples waiting to be checked in
margos arm is through bills
they become increasingly aware of their imminent separation
eve senses her superfluity
bill cranes at the passenger heading the line in earnest conversation with the dispatcher
they have to time it so everybody gets on at the last minute
so they can close the doors and let you sit
the man up ahead moves on
i have a suggestion
they look at her theres really not much time left i mean you havent had a minute alone yet and well i could take care of everything here and meet
you at the gate with the ticket
if youd like
i think wed like very much
sure you wont mind
of course not
bill hands eve the ticket
margo smiles gratefully at her
eve smiles back
its covered with glass windows
margos arm is in bills
shes quite a girl that whats her name
id forgotten they grew that way
the lack of pretense that sort of strange directness and understanding did she tell you about the theater and what it meant
grins i told her
i sounded off
all the religions in the world rolled into one and were gods and goddesses
isnt it silly suddenly ive developed a big protective feeling for her a lamb loose in our big stone jungle
bill pauses and pulls her to one side
some passengers go by
take care of yourself out there
i understand theyve got the indians pretty well in hand
dont get stuck on some glamour puss ill try
youre not such a bargain you know conceited and thoughtless and messy everybody cant be gregory peck
youre a setup for some gorgeous wide eyed young babe
how childish are you going to get before you quit it
i dont want to be childish id settle for just a few years firmly and cut that out right now
am i going to lose you bill
as of this moment youre six years old
he starts to kiss her stops when he becomes aware of eve standing near them
she has his ticket in her hand
she hands bill his ticket they start toward the gate
in the b
a few visitors
bill hands his ticket to the guard turns to eve
thanks for your help
bill puts his arms around margo
knit me a muffler
call me when you get in
margos arms tighten desperately
bill pulls away kisses her again lightly starts for the plane
margo turns away
eve puts her arms through margos
bill pauses en route to the plane
margo turns to look at him with eve
keep your eyes on her
dont let her get lonely
shes a loose lamb in a jungle
eve looks at margo
bill waves climbs aboard
the door is closed behind him the departure routine starts
margo and eve turn to go
they walk down the passage
as they walk eve gently disengages her arm from margos and puts it comfortingly about her
that same night we sent for eves things her few pitiful possessions
she moved into the little guest room on the top floor
margo slides her fingers reflectively up and down the sides of the almost empty highball glass
she cried when she saw it it was so like her little room back home in wisconsin
addison eyeing her quizzically
he offers her the whiskey
margo shakes her head absently
she looks down at her glass again
then she raises her eyes to look at eve
the next three weeks were out of a fairy tale and i was cinderella in the last act
eve became my sister lawyer mother friend psychiatrist and cop the honeymoon was on
its one floor above street level
a long narrow room smartly furnished including a sarah siddons award
margos narrative overlaps into the scene which is a silent eve sits at a smart desk
she is just arranging a stack of letters which she carries to margo with a pen
margo sits comfortably by the fire with a play script
she hands the scrips up to eve shakes her head and holds her nose
eve smiles takes the script hands margo the letters to sign
birdie comes in with a tea tray which she sets on a low table before the fire
the phone rings
birdie and eve both go for it
eve gets there first
by her polite but negative attitude we know she is giving someone a skillful brush off
birdie glares first at her then at margo
margo leans her head back closes her eyes blissfully
birdie slams the double door to the landing on her way out
from the wings
the audience is never visible
eve in the f
margo and company taking a curtain call
the curtain falls
the cast except for margo and two male leads walk off
the curtain rises again
eve watching and listening to the storm of applause
her eyes shine she clasps and unclasps her hands
the stage eve again in the f
again the curtain falls
this time the two men go off
curtain rises on margo alone
if anything the applause builds
eve that same hypnotic look
there are tears in her eyes
the curtain falls offscene then rises again margo the curtain falls again between her and camera
backstage the curtain just settling on the floor
margo starts off
shakes her head from now on its not applause just something to do till the aisles get less crowded
she walks as she talks and winds up at eve still in the wings
eves eyes are wet she dabs at her nose
i could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time grins performance number one thousand of this one if i play it that long will
take place in a well padded booby hatch
she takes eves arm they stroll toward her dressing room
i must say you can certainly tell mr
sampsons been gone a month
you certainly can
especially if youre me between now and tomorrow morning
i mean the performance
except for you youd think hed never even directed it its disgraceful the way they change everything around
smiles well teachers away and actors will be actors
during your second act scene with your father roger ferradays supposed to stay way upstage at the arch
hes been coming closer down every night
when he gets too close ill spit in his eye
theyre at her dressing room by now
margos been unhooking her gown with eves help
they go in
its undergone quite a change
a new carpet chintz covers for the furniture new lampshades dainty curtains across the filthy barred window
birdie waits within
shes listening to a fight she shuts it off as they enter
entering you bought the new girdles a size smaller
i can feel it
something maybe grew a size bigger
when we get home youre going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours
i couldnt get into the girdle in two an a half hours
margos out of her wig and dress by now
she gets into her robe sits at the dressing table
eves on the chaise by the discarded costume
you havent noticed my latest bit of interior decorating
turns looks well youve done so much
i made them myself
they are lovely
arent they lovely birdie
we now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop
just because you cant even work a zipper
it was very thoughtful eve and i appreciate it a pause
eve rises picking up margos costume
while youre cleaning up ill take this to the wardrobe mistress dont bother
brownll be along for it in a minute
no trouble at all
and she goes out with the costume
birdie opens her mouth shuts it then opens it again
if i may so bold as to say something did you ever hear the word union
behind in your dues
i havent got a union
im slave labor
but the wardrobe women have got one
and next to a tenor a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business catching on oh oh
shes got two things to do carry clothes an press em wrong an just let anybody else muscle in
as she talks margo hurries to the door and out after eve
margo pops out looks for eve then stares in amazement
eve near the wings
she stands before a couple of cheval mirrors set up for cast members
she has margos dress held up against her body
she turns this way and that bows as if to applause mimicking margo exactly
margo watches her curiously
then she smiles
calling eve eve startled whips the gown away turns to margo
margo smiles understandingly
quietly i think wed better let mrs
brown pick up the wardrobe
wordlessly eve brings it toward her
a bedside clock with a luminous dial reads a
the phone rings
her head comes up out of the pillow she shakes it
she fumbles switches on a lamp then picks up the phone
we are ready with your call to beverly hills
call what call
it this templeton
miss margo channing
thats right but i dont understand we are ready with the call you placed for midnight california time to mr
william sampson in beverly hills
go ahead please
a loud happy squawk margo
what a wonderful surprise
margo jumps at his vehemence
as she does so the screen wipes down diagonally left to right so that margo remains in the lower right hand diagonal of the screen and bill is disclosed in
the upper left
he too is in bed reading
his clock says midnight
continuing what a thoughtful ever lovin thing to do dazed bill
have i gone crazy bill
youre my girl arent you
that i am
then youre crazy
nods in agreement when when are you coming back
i leave in a week the pictures all wrapped up we previewed last night
like opening out of town but terrifying
theres nothing you can do youre trapped youre in a tin can in a tin can cellophane or wrapped in a navajo blanket i want you home
you in a hurry
a big hurry be quick about it so good night darling and sleep tight
wait a minute
you cant hang up you havent even said it bill you know how much i do but over the phone now really thats kid stuff
kid stuff or not it doesnt happen every day i want to heat it and if you wont say it you can sing it
convinced shes gone mad sing it
like the western union boys used to do
margos eyes pop
her jaw and the phone sag
bill its your birthday
and who remembered it
who was there on the dot at twelve midnight
margo knows damn well it wasnt she
miserably happy birthday darling
the reading could have been better but you said it now many happy returns of the day
the same many happy returns of the day
i get a party dont i
of course birthday and welcome home
wholl i ask
laughs its no secret i know all about the party eve wrote me
she hasnt missed a week since i left but you know all that you probably tell her what to write
anyway i sent her a list of people to ask check with her
how is eve
i love you
mutters ill check with eve
i love you too
good night darling see you
margo hangs up
bill hangs up
he replaces the phone picks up his book
slow wipe until only margo is on screen
she puts her phone away
she gets a cigarette
she lights it
she rolls over on her back
margo is propped up in bed still reflective
birdie comes in with her breakfast tray and a hi which gets a hi from margo
she starts on some petty chores
margo takes a sip of orange juice
you dont like eve do you
do you want an argument or an answer
now you want an argument
she works hard
night an day
shes loyal and efficient like an agent with one client
she thinks only for me
no answer from birdie doesnt she
lets say she thinks only about you anyway
how do you mean that
birdie stops whatever it is shes doing
ill tell you how
like lets see like she was studyin you like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints
how you walk talk think eat sleep breaks in sharply im sure thats very flattering birdie and im sure theres nothing wrong with that
there is a sharp brisk knock
eve comes in
shes dressed in a smart suit
she carries a leather portfolio
margo says good morning birdie says nothing
eve shows off the suit proudly
well what do you think of my elegant new suit
it looks better on you than it did on me
scoffs i can imagine
you know all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there are you sure you wont want it yourself
i find it just a bit too too seventeenish for me
laughs oh come now as though you were an old lady
im on my way
is there anything more youve thought of
theres the script to go back to the guild ive got it
and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man
it seems i cant think of a thing you havent thought of
smile thats my job
she turns to go see you at tea time
eve turns at the door by any chance did you place a call from me to bill for midnight california time
gasps oh golly
and i forgot to tell you yes dear
you forgot all about it
well i was sure youd want to of course being his birthday and youve been so busy these past few days and last night i meant to tell you before
you went out with the richards and i guess i was asleep when you got home
yes i guess you were
it it was very thoughtful of you eve
i certainly wouldnt forget that
youd never forgive me
she smiles shyly as a matter of fact i sent him a telegram myself
and shes gone
margo stares at the closed door
then at birdie
birdie without comment goes out
margo alone looks down at her orange juice
absently she twirls it in its bed of shaved ice
margo reflectively twirling her highball glass
the applause continues
she lifts her glass to drink
her glance meets karens
she raises the glass in a silent toast
karen smiles wanly at margos toast
then the smile fades as she looks reflectively back to eve
i saw eve quite often after our first meeting but we never really talked again until the party margo gave for bill when he returned from hollywood
the bed is littered with fur coats
through the open door from the floor below the murmur of a party at a late hour
its always convenient at a party to know the hostess well enough to use her bedroom rather than go where all the others have to go
karen is making repairs at margos dressing table
eve enters carrying a magnificent sable coat which she drops on the bed
now whos show up at this hour
its time people went home hold that coat up
eve holds it up karen whistles whose is it
some hollywood movie star her plane got in late
discouraging isnt it
women with furs like that where it never gets cold
tell me eve how are things with you
eve melts into warmth
she beams sits on the bed
karen has spun around on the dressing table stool
there should be a new word for happiness
being here with miss channing has been i just cant say shes been so wonderful done so much for me smiles lloyd says margo compensates for underplaying on the stage
by overplaying reality
she gets up gets her coat next to that sable my new mink seems like an old bedjacket
throws it over her shoulder youve done your share eve
youve worked wonders with margo
she starts out
pauses smiles karen
she picks at the coverlet isnt it awful im about to ask you for another favor after all youve already done
crosses to her nobodys done so much eve youve got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the hundred neediest cases
what is it
miss channings affairs are in such good shape
there isnt enough to keep me as busy as i should be really not that ive ever considered anything that would take me away from her
but the other day when i heard mr
fabian tell miss channing that her understudy was going to have a baby and theyd have to replace her
she looks down at the coverlet once more
you want to be margos new understudy
i dont let myself think about it even she looks up rises as she speaks but i do know the part so well and every bit of the staging thered
be no need to break in a new girl suddenly afraid she sits but suppose i had to go on one night
to an audience that came to see margo channing
no i couldnt possibly
laughs dont worry too much about that
margo just doesnt miss performances
if she can walk crawl or roll she plays
nods proudly the show must go on
margo must go on
she sits beside eve as a matter of fact i see no reason why you shouldnt be margos understudy
do you think miss channing would approve
i think she would cheer
richards and mr
sampson theyll do as theyre told
eve smiles a little
then would you talk to mr
fabian about it
you wont forget it
i wont forget
i seem to be forever thanking you for something dont i
she hugs karen leaves
she nearly collides with birdie on her way in
the bed looks like a dead animal act
which one is sables
pointing but she just got here
shes on her way
with half the men in the joint
she hold up the coat its only a fur coat
what did you expect live sables
a diamond collar gold sleeves you know picture people
they start out
bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here they can always grab oranges off trees
this you cant do in times square
through the open door we see them go down the stairs and out of sight
karen and birdie come down the stairs to bill max addison a blonde young lady named miss caswell addisons protegee of the moment and at the feet of bill and
they are all seated on the steps
birdie goes through and down the stairs to the first floor
karen remains with the others
addison is holding forth every now and then some elder statesman of the theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk
ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings
as birdie and the sables pass now theres something a girl could make sacrifices for
and probably has
to miss caswell did you say sable or gable
it is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in new york hollywood and london are no different from the good people of des moines chillicothe and liverpool
by and large we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics egomaniacs emotional misfits and precocious children to bill gable
why a feller like that dont come east to do a play
nods he must be miserable the life he lives out there these so called abnormalities theyre our stock in trade they make us actors writers directors et cetera in the
first place answer me this
what makes a man become a producer
what makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair
this answer satisfies me a hundred percent
we all have abnormality in common
we are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity we theater folk
we are the original displaced personalities
laughs to eve you dont have to read his column tomorrow you just heard it
i dont agree addison
that happens to be your particular abnormality
oh i admit theres a screwball element in the theater
it sticks out its got spotlights on it and a brass band
but it isnt basic it isnt standard if it were the theater couldnt survive
to a passing butler oh waiter
the butler goes right by
that isnt a waiter my dear
thats a butler
well i cant yell oh butler can i
maybe somebodys name is butler
you have a point
an idiotic one but a point
i dont want to make trouble
all i want is a drink
getting up leave me get you one
pitching oh thank you mr
max leaves with her empty glass
i see your career rising in the east like the sun
to bill you were saying
i was saying that the theater is nine tenths hard work
work done the hard way by sweat application and craftsmanship
ill agree to this that to be a good actor actress or anything else in the theater means wanting to be that more than anything else in the world
yes it does
goes on it means concentration of ambition desire and sacrifice such as no other profession demands
and ill agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms cant be ordinary cant be just someone
to give so much for almost always so little
eve speaks almost unaware of what she says
she looks at no one in particular just off
so little did you say
why if theres nothing else theres applause
its like like waves of love coming over the footlights and wrapping you up
to know every night that different hundreds of people love you
they smile their eyes shine youve pleased them they want you you belong
just that alone is worth anything
she becomes aware of addisons strange smile of bills looks of warm interest
shes embarrassed she turns away then scrambles to her feet as margo approaches with lloyd from the direction of the pantry
margos had too much to drink
her fake smile fades as eve gets up
shes unpleasant and depressed
dont get up
and please stop acting as if i were the queen mother
hurt im sorry i didnt mean to sharply outside of a beehive margo your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly
youre in a beehive pal didnt you know
were all busy little bees full of stings making honey day and night to eve arent we honey
please dont play governess karen i havent your unyielding good taste i wish id gone to radcliffe too but father wouldnt hear of it he needed help at the notions
to addison im being rude now arent i
or should i say aint i
youre maudlin and full of self pity
max has come up with miss caswells drink
how about calling it a night
and you pose as a playwright
a situation pregnant with possibilities and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep
its a good thought
it wont play
as a nonprofessional i think its an excellent idea
undramatic but practical
as she speaks she makes her way to lloyds side
happy little housewife
cut it out
this is my house not a theater
in my house youre a guest not a director
then stop being a star start treating your guests as your supporting cast
now lets not get into a big hassle its about time we did
its about time margo realized that whats attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off
suddenly all right
im going to bed
to bill you be the host
its your party
happy birthday welcome home and we who are about to die salute you
she starts upstairs
need any help
pauses smiles to put me to bed
take my clothes off hold my head tuck me in turn off the lights tiptoe out
wouldnt you eve
if youd like
i wouldnt like
she goes up exits out of sight
miss caswell reaches up to take the drink out of maxs hand
i forgot i had it
bill gets up and goes after margo
well miss the third act
theyre going to play it off stage
eve turns away abruptly in sudden tears
in a minute
she crosses to eve puts an arm around her
you mustnt mind margo too much even if i do
but there must be some reason something ive done without knowing
the reason is margo and dont try to figure it out
if i thought id offended her of all people eve
im fond of margo too
but i know margo
and every now and then there is nothing i want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants
smiles well if shes got to pick on someone id just as soon it was me
karen smiles back
she joins lloyd and max
max is going to drop us
ive often wondered max why you bother with a chauffeur and limousine in new york city
in my case its necessary
too many taxi drivers write plays
and too many of them are produced
lets go sit by the piano
you have me confused with dan dailey
you go sit by the piano
to eve and you come sit by me
to the others good night
they laugh say good night and start downstairs
as eve crosses to addison karen
karen pauses you wont forget will you
what we talked about before
smiles no eve i wont forget
she follows the men downstairs
close up of an old engraving of mrs
siddons as the tragic muse which hangs among other theatrical mementos on the stair wall
the applause continues
margo sits back in her chair now picking at a bit of fingernail polish
bills welcoming home birthday party
a night to go down in history
like the chicago fire or the massacre of the huguenots
even before the party started i could smell disaster in the air
the same night as the previous sequence but before the party has started
margo is all dressed except for jewelry
she stands before her dressing table putting it on
she sips at an enormous martini
i knew it i sensed it even as i finished dressing for that blasted party
birdie comes in
you all put together
my backs open
birdie goes to work on it did the extra help get here
theres some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers
whod you call the william morris agency
youre not being funny i could get actors for less
what about the food
the caterer had to back for hors doeuvres she zips margo voila
laughs that french ventriloquist taught you a lot didnt he
there was nothing he didnt know
she starts tidying the room theres a message from the bartender
does miss channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake
the only thing i ordered by mistake is the guests
birdie cackles theyre domestic too and they dont care what they drink as long as it burns
late for what
dont be dense
i aint dense
and hes been here twenty minutes
well i certainly think its odd he hasnt even come up
her glance meets birdies
she turns and strolls out
margo speeds up going down the stairs
margo shows up again deliberately as she reaches the landing
sound of bill and eve laughing together from the living room
margo strolls toward it casually
we see eve seated looking up fascinated at bill as he talks out of the laughter
dont let it worry you said the cameraman even demille couldnt see anything looking through the wrong end eve chuckles so that was the first and last time eve sees
she gets up
as margo strolls up very off hand
dont let me kill the point
or isnt it a story for grownups
youve heard it
about when i looked through the wrong end of a camera finder
to eve remind me to tell you about when i looked into the heart of an artichoke
id like to hear it
some snowy night in front of the fire
in the meantime while were on the subject will you check about the hors doeuvres
the caterer forgot them the varnish wasnt dry or something
a short lull
margo looks into cigarette boxes
bill eyes her curiosity crosses to the fire
looks like im going to have a very fancy party
i thought you were going to be late when im guest of honor
i had no idea you were even here
i ran into eve on my way upstairs she told me you were dressing
that never stopped you before
well we started talking she wanted to know all about hollywood she seemed so interested
shes a girl of so many interests
its a pretty rare quality these days
shes a girl of so many rare qualities
so she seems
the steel begins to flash so youve pointed out so often
so many qualities so often
her loyalty efficiency devotion warmth affection and so young
so young and so fair
bill catches the drift
i cant believe youre making this up it sounds like something out of an old clyde fitch play
clyde fitch thought you may not think so was well before my time
laughs ive always denied the legend that you were in our american cousin the night lincoln was shot
i dont think thats funny
of course its funny this is all too laughable to be anything else
you know what i think about this this age obsession of yours and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because i spent ten minutes
with a stage struck kid twenty minutes
thirty minutes forty minutes
what of it
stage struck kid
shes a young lady of qualities
and ill have you know im fed up with both the young lady and her qualities
studying me as if as if i were a play or a set of blueprints
how i walk talk think eat sleep
now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible
stop calling her a kid
it so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which i would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges
for instance what
for instance you
this is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you but im not going to
im too mad guilty
darling there are certain characteristics for which you are famous on stage and off
i love you for some of them and in spite of others
i havent let those become too important to me
theyre part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment youve got to keep your teeth sharp
but you will not sharpen them on me or on eve
what about her teeth
what about her fangs
she hasnt cut them yet and you know it
so when you start judging an idealistic dreamy eyed kid by the barroom benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society i wont have it
eve harrington has never by word look thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love
and to intimate anything else doesnt spell jealousy to me it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of
what happens in the next reel
do i get dragged off screaming to the snake pit
quietly miss channing
bill and margo look off
eve is in the room
they have no way of knowing how long shes been there
the hors doeuvres are here
is there anything else i can do
thank you eve
id like a martini very dry
ill get it
he crosses to eve whatll you have
eve involuntarily looks to margo
eve smiles turns to bill
very dry please
bill smiles back and starts across the landing toward the pantry
as he crosses the stairs karen lloyd and max come up from the street level below
bill continues up to pantry
eve and then margo come up to add their welcome
to karen may i have your coat
dont bother i can take it up myself
karen yields with a thank you eve
eve goes up with the coat
lloyd looks after her approvingly
i like that girl
that quality of quiet graciousness
among so many quiet qualities
they start for the living room
margo nothing youve ever done has made me as happy as your taking eve in
im so happy youre happy
look you havent been running a settlement house exactly the kids earned her way
you had a pretty mixed up inventory when she took over merchandise laying all over the shop
youve got margo mixed up with a five and ten cent store
make it bergdorf goodman
and now everything is on its proper shelf eh max
done up in little ribbons
i could die right now and nobodyd be confused
how about you max
how about me what
theyve come to a halt near the fireplace
supposed you dropped dead
what about your inventory
i aint gonna die
not with a hit
this is the most ghoulish conversation
bill brings two martinis
he hands one to margo
it drips ice thank you
the kid junior that is will be right down
unless youd like to take her drink up to her
smiles i can always get a fresh one
karen youre a gibson girl
he hands eves drink to karen
max has wandered off
other guests are arriving
margo gulps her drink hands bill the empty glass
he puts it on a passing tray
margo takes a fresh one at the same time
the general atmosphere is very macbethish
what has or is about to happen
to bill what is he talking about
to margo we know you weve seen you before like this
is it over or just beginning
margo surveys them all
fasten your seat belts
its going to be a bumpy night
she downs the drink hands the empty glass to bill and leaves them
she passes two women gabbing by the piano
as they see her margo darling
she arrives at the landing just as addison comes up with miss caswell
margo takes a drink from a passing tray
to addison i distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list
what are you doing here
you were an unforgettable peter pan you must play it again soon
you remember miss caswell
i do not
how do you do
we never met
miss caswell is an actress
a graduate of copacabana school of dramatic arts
his glance is attracted by eve coming downstairs ah
deferentially good evening mr
i had no idea you knew each other
this must be at long last our formal introduction
until now we have met only in passing
thats how you met me
smiles eve this is an old friend of mr
dewitts mother miss caswell miss harrington
the two girls say hello addison ive been wanting you to meet eve for the longest time murmurs it could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from
youve heard of her great interest in the theater we have that in common
then you two must have a long talk im afraid mr
dewitt would find me boring before too long
you wont bore him honey
you wont even get to talk
icily claudia dear come closer
she does and he points this is max fabian
he is a producer
go do yourself some good
sighs why do they always look like unhappy rabbits
because that is what they are
go make him happy
miss caswell drapes her coat over the rail heads for max
addison puts eves arm in his
to margo you mustnt worry about your little charge
she is in safe hands
eve smiles uncertainly at margo as he leads her away
margo looks after them
she downs her drink
its many martinis later
most of the guests have gone
the party has reached that static state everyones assumed more or less permanent places
birdie passes carrying a cup of coffee
camera follows her to the piano where margo sits on the bench beside the pianist
he is just finishing liebestraum and she stares moodily into a martini
birdie halts beside her with the coffee
margo looks up
birdie holds out the coffee
margo takes the onion out of the martini drops it into the coffee and waves birdie away
liebestraum comes to an end
the pianist tries to ease into a more sophisticated rhythm
margo stops him
i just played it
play it again
but that was the fourth straight time
then this will be five
i suppose you think im too drunk to count
youre just crazy about liebestraum
look miss channing
its kind of depressing
if you dont mind my saying so everybodys kind of dying on the vine
my dear horowitz
in the first place im paying you union scale
second its my piano
third if everybody doesnt like kind of dying on the vine they can get off the vine and go home
unhappily he plays liebestraum
margo sips her martini stares down into it again
bill tiptoes up
whispers many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body
where has it been laid out
somberly it hasnt been laid out we havent finished with the embalming
as a matter of fact youre looking at it
the remains of margo channing
it is my last wish to be buried sitting up
trying to kid her out of it wouldnt you feel more natural taking a bow
you know nothing about feelings natural or unnatural
then without feeling your guests were also wondering whether the music couldnt be a shade more on the shall we say happier side
if my guests do not like it here i suggest they accompany you to the nursery where im sure you will all feel more at home
bill is about to get mad when max bustles up
you by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house
sympathetic poor max
max nods its that miss caswell
i dont know why she doesnt give addison heartburn
no heart to burn
everybody has a heart except some people
she finishes her drink stands up of course ive got bicarb
theres a box in the pantry
well put your name on it
itll say there
just for you
touched let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck
its friends that count
and i got friends
i love you max
i really mean it
i love you
come to the pantry
she takes off
max waits to set bill straight
she loves me like a father
also shes loaded
he starts off after margo
as the camera pans with bill we see margo going into the pantry with max following her
bill joins addison and miss caswell on the stairs
its a good sized one
in the b
the caterers are packing dishes glassware etc
margo crosses to a cupboard
she finds the bicarb
here you are maxie dear
one good burp and youll be rid of that miss caswell
the situation im in aint the kind you can belch your way out
i made a promise
max nods what
an audition for the part were replacing
whats her name your sister
he adds water to the bicarb
well if she can act she might not be bad
she looks like she might burn down a plantation
mixing i feel right now like theres one burning in me
whens the audition
a couple of weeks
i tell you what
why dont i read with her
anything to help you out max
this is real cooperation
i appreciate it
not at all
and you could do me a big favor if you would all you got to do is name it
give eve harrington job in you office
you get quick action dont you
margo i wouldnt think of taking that girl away from you
you said yourself my inventory was in good shape all of my merchandise put away
to keep her here with nothing to do id be standing in her way
and you need her max
but what could she do
shed be a great help read scripts interview people you have to see get rid of the ones you dont have to
youd be a man of leisure well
think of your health max more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track
i dont know if this would be a wise move
happily thats my max
lloyd enters looking for her
there you are both of you
max karen has decided its time to go
where is she
up in the room
if youll excuse me to margo ill tell miss caswell
he goes out
whos left out there
and youve got a new guest
a movie star from hollywood
and my autograph book is at the cleaners
you disapprove of me when im like this dont you
sometimes though i wish i understood you better
when you do let me in on it
hows the new one coming
all right i guess
shes still a girl of twenty
it isnt important
dont you think its about time it became important
how do you mean
dont be evasive
margo you havent got any age
miss channing is ageless
spoken like a press agent
i know what im talking about after all theyre my plays
spoken like an author
abruptly lloyd im not twentyish
i am not thirtyish
three months ago i was forty years old
smiles that slipped out i hadnt quite made up my mind to admit it
now i feel as if id suddenly taken all my clothes off
week after week to thousands of people youre as young as you want
as young as they want you mean
and im not interested in whether thousands of people think im six or six hundred just one person
isnt that so
margo doesnt answer you know what this is all about dont you
it has very little to do with whether you should play cora it has everything to do with the fact that youve had another fight with bill
margo closes the box of bicarb
bills thirty two
he looks thirty two
he looked it five years ago hell look it twenty years from now
i hate men
she puts the box down dont worry lloyd
ill play your play
ill wear rompers and come in rolling a hoop if you like
lets go say good night
they exit into the dining room
as they open the swinging door the camera remains in the doorway
margo and lloyd walk toward the stairs
in the b
eve is talking to the group
how much she says is dependent on how long it takes margo and lloyd to reach her
in the b
to know every night that different hundreds of people love you
they smile their eyes shine youve pleased them they want you you belong
anythings worth that
just as before she becomes aware of margos approach with lloyd
she scrambles to her feet
dont get up
and please stop acting as if i were the queen mother
and as margo speaks or before we margo gets out of a cab in front of the theater and goes in
its friday afternoon no performance
what was it the wise man said this too will pass away
two weeks later the day of the audition all was well with bill and me the world and me margo comes from the street through the lobby a few people
buying tickets and into the deserted foyer
she spots addison sprawled on one of the sofas
why so remote addison
i should think youd be at the side of your protegee lending her moral support
miss caswell at the moment is where i can lend no support moral or otherwise
the ladies shall we say lounge
being violently ill to her tummy
its good luck before an audition
shell be all right once it starts
she heads for the auditorium
miss caswell got lucky too late
the audition is over
it cant be
ive come to read with her
i promised max
the audition was called for
it is now nearly four
lightly is it really
i must start wearing a watch i never do you know
who read with miss caswell
he shakes his head lloyd
he shakes his head well it couldnt have been max
naturally enough your understudy
i consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy i refer to your new and unpregnant understudy
keenly didnt you know
quickly of course i knew
it just slipped your mind
a moment of silence
how was miss caswell
frankly i dont remember
just slipped your mind
nor i am sure could anyone else present tell you how miss caswell read or whether miss caswell read or rode a pogo stick
was she that bad
as addison speaks he rises with excitement
margo as you know i have lived in the theater as a trappist monk lives in his faith
i have no other world no other life and once in a great while i experience that moment of revelation for which all true believers wait and pray
you were one
jeanne eagels another
hayes there are others three or four
eve harrington will be among them
flatly i take it she read well
it wasnt reading it was a performance
brilliant vivid something made of music and fire
in time shell be what you are
a mass of music and fire
an old kazoo and some sparkles
tell me was bill swept away too or were you too full of revelation to notice
bill didnt say but lloyd was beside himself
he listened to his play as if someone else had written it he said it sounded so fresh so new so full of meaning
how nice for lloyd
and how nice for eve
how nice for everybody
addison of course knows exactly what shes doing
he senses the approaching typhoon he whips it up
eve was incredibly modest
she insisted that no credit was due her that lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them
the implication being that i have not been reading them as written
to the best of my recollection neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation
miss caswell appears uncertain in the b
feeling better my dear
like i just swam the english channel
you next move it seems to me should be toward television
margo abruptly starts for the auditorium
he takes miss caswells arm
tell me this
do they have auditions for television
thats all television is my dear
nothing but auditions
he takes her toward the street
the curtain is up the set covered is a bedroom in a deteriorating southern mansion
there is no one in the theater but max seated on the aisle about two thirds down and eve with lloyd and bill on the stage
she is seated they stand between her and auditorium
there is some ad lib talk among the three which we cannot make out
margo marches down the aisle with a steady pace
she passes max smiles a sickly hopeful smile
she ignores him as if he were a used paper cup
she disappears through the door which leads backstage
max indicated the door and puts his hands to his head in despair
margo walks out of the wings on stage
bill and lloyd turn to her
cheerily terribly sorry im late lunch was long and i couldnt find a cab wheres miss caswell shall we start
oh hello eve
hello miss channing
how are you making out in mr
over the footlights to max i dont want you working the child too hard max just because you promised
as you see i kept my promise too
max slumps in his seat
by the time margo turns back to them the others have exchanged swift looks
its all over
whats all over
pleased astonishment eve
she turns to her how enchanting
to lloyd and bill wherever did you get the idea of having eve read with miss caswell
shes your understudy
eve my understudy
but i had no idea
i thought you knew
she was put on over a week ago it seems almost inconceivable that i havent seen her backstage but with so many people loitering around
so eve is not working for max after all out to max again max you sly puss
max submerges further in his seat
miss channing i cant tell you how glad i am that you arrived so late
well if youd been here to begin with i wouldnt have dared to read at all
and if youd come in the middle id have stopped i couldnt have gone on murmurs what a pity all that fire and music being turned off
what fire and music
you wouldnt understand
to lloyd how was miss caswell
back to copacabana
margo let me tell you about eve breaking in i was dreadful miss channing believe me i have no right to be anyones understudy much less yours
im sure you underestimate yourself eve
you always do
to lloyd you were about to tell me about eve
youd have been proud of her
she was a revelation
to you too
what do you mean
the ice begins to form i mean among other things that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty four year old character played by twenty four year
thats beside the point
its right to the point
also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them
so full of meaning fire and music
youve been talking to that venomous fishwife addison dewitt in this case apparently as trustworthy as the world almanac
you knew when you came in that the audition was over that eve was your understudy
playing that childish game of cat and mouse
not mouse never mouse
if anything rat
you have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most
man have been hanged for less
im lied to attacked behind my back accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately as if it were holy gospel
i never said it was
then you listened as if someone else had written you play whom did you have in mind
beaumont and fletcher
max has edged his way to the stage
from below may i say a word
to margo what makes you think that either miller or sherwood would stand for the nonsense i take from you youd better stick to beaumont and fletcher
theyve been dead for three hundred years
he stalks into the wings
bills reaction to the fight is typical
he lights a cigarette stretches out on the covered bed
eve stands frozen with fear
margo yells after lloyd into the wings
and theyre getting better performances today than they ever got
all playwrights should be dead for three hundred years
lloyd comes out of the door leading to the auditorium
the battle goes on without a pause
as he yells back he crosses to max at row a center
that would solve none of their problems because actresses never die
the stars never die and never change
he starts up the aisle with max
you can change this star any time you want
for a new fresh exciting one fully equipped with fire and music
any time you want starting with tonights performance
now its max who stops and shouts back at her
this is for lawyers to talk about this concerns a run of the play contract and this you cant rewrite or ad lib
from the stage are you threatening me with legal action mr
are you breaking the contract
answer my question
who am i to threaten
im a dying man
i didnt hear you
yelling i said im a dying man
not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill
from the top of the aisle i shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind
just when exactly does an actress decide theyre her words shes saying and her thoughts shes expressing
usually at the point when shes got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater
its about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto
max has already walked out unhappily
lloyd now slams out
margo glares after him then turns to bill who smokes his cigarette peacefully on the bed
quiet menace and you i take it are the paderewski who plays his concerto on me the piano
bill waves his cigarette hes noncommittal where is princess fire and music
looks lazily gone
i must have frightened her away
i wouldnt be surprised
sometimes you frighten me
paces up and down poor little flower
just dropped her petals and folded her tent
dont mix your metaphors
i mix what i like
im nothing but a body with a voice
what a body what a voice
the ex ship news reporter
no body no voice all mind
the gong rang
the fights over
i will not calm down
dont calm down
youre being terribly tolerant arent you
im trying terribly hard
well you neednt
i will not be tolerated
and i will not be plotted against
here we go
such nonsense what do you all take me for little nell from the country
been my understudy for over a week without my knowing carefully hidden no doubt sits up now dont get carried away going right on shows up for an audition when
everyone knew id be here
and gives a performance
out of nowhere gives a performance
youve been all through that with lloyd the playwright doesnt make the performance and it doesnt just happen
and this one didnt full of fire and music and whatnot it was carefully rehearsed i have no doubt over and over full of those bill sampson touches
i am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts
i didnt know eve harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon
tell that to dr
along with the rest of it
she turns away
bill grabs her pulls her down on the bed
he holds her down
no ill tell it to you
for the last time ill tell it to you
because youve got to stop hurting yourself and me and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums
struggling that word again
i dont even know what it means
firmly its time you found out
i love you
margo says ha
i love you
youre a beautiful and intelligent woman margo says a body with a voice a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress he waits margo says nothing at the peak
of her career
you have every reason for happiness margo says except happiness every reason but due to some strange uncontrollable unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid margo sneers
kid like eve to turn you into a hysterical screaming harpy
now once and for all stop it
margo seems quiet
he gets up
she sits up
its obvious youre not a woman
ive been aware of that for some time
well i am
dont be condescending
come on get up
ill buy you a drink
with dignity i admit i may have seen better days but i am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail like a salted peanut
laughs margo lets make peace
the terms are too high
just being happy
just stopping all this nonsense about eve and eve and me
its not nonsense
but if i tell you it is as i just did
were you listening to me
margo nods isnt that enough
i wish it were
then what would be enough
margo doesnt answer if we were married
i wouldnt want you to marry me just to prove something
youve had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me
margo tell me whats behind all this
i i dont know bill
just a feeling i dont know
i think you do know but you wont or cant tell me
margo doesnt say i said before it was going to be my last try and i meant it
i cant think of anything else to do
i wish i could
a pause we usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down
then it comes up again and everythings fine
but not this time
he takes a breath you know there isnt a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people
no word from her
he starts away
he stops where are you going
to find eve
smiles grimly that suddenly makes the whole thing believable
he goes out
margo alone sit for a moment sadly
then she begins to cry
one large room a small foyer with a door to the corridor
a stair up one wall to a narrow balcony from which a couple of bedroom open
karen is painting
earnestly but badly
a still life of an orange an avocado an eggplant and three bananas
on the day of the audition my biggest worry was to keep a banana looking part of an eggplant
then lloyd came home
in the b
lloyd lets himself in it was right after his brawl with margo
lloyd slams the door flings his hat away strides in peeling off muffler and overcoat
lloyd what happened
up to here
thats where ive got it up to here
of all the star ridden presumptuous hysterical margo again
and again and again
two hours late for the audition to begin with thats on time for margo
then a childish heavy handed routine about not knowing eve was her understudy its just possible she didnt
of course she knew
for one thing addison told her how superbly eve had read the part
suddenly softening karen let me tell you about eve
shes got everything a born actress
sensitive understanding young exciting vibrant dont run out of adjectives dear
everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about
until his play becomes a vehicle for miss channing
margo hasnt done badly by it
she knows it
thats the trouble
she can play pecks bad boy all she wants and whos to stop her
whos to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves
he starts up the stairs to the bedroom
murmurs its going to be a cozy weekend
pauses what is
were driving out to the country tomorrow night
just the four of us
bill margo you and i
weve spent weekends before with nobody talking
continues up stairs just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects
as he goes into one of the bedrooms karen sits thoughtfully on a couch
newton they say thought of gravity by getting hit on the head by an apple
and the man who invented the steam engine he was watching a tea kettle
but not me
my big idea came to me just sitting on a couch
she lies down folds her hands behind her head
that boot in the rear to margo
heaven knows she had one coming
from me from lloyd from eve bill max and so on wed all felt those size fives of hers often enough
the answer was buzzing around me like a fly
she sits up
the smile fades
i had it
but i let it go
screaming and calling names is one thing but this could mean
she shakes her head crosses to her easel resumes work on the bananas
she slows down then stops
why i said to myself not
it would all seem perfectly legitimate
and there were only two people in the world who would know
also the boot would land where it would do the most good for all concerned she puts the brush away and crosses to the phone which is by lloyds work
as she crosses and after all it was not more than a perfectly harmless joke which margo herself would be the first to enjoy
she looks in a leather phone book pick up the phone and dials
and no reason why she shouldnt be told about it in time
theres an answer at the other end
into phone hello
will you call miss eve harrington to the phone please
not at all
and as she waits we
preferably no houses in sight
plenty of snow
lloyds car drives along
it was a cold weekend outside and in
bill didnt come at all
margo didnt know where he was and didnt care she kept saying
somehow we staggered through sunday and by the time we drive margo to the station late monday afternoon she and lloyd had thawed out to the extent of being civil
to each other
all three in the front seat
what time is it
when you asked a minute ago it was five forty two
it is now five forty three
when you ask a minute from no it will be i just dont want margo to miss her train
as it is shell barely make the theater
five fifty five
well be at the station in plenty of time
that little place just two hours form new york
its on my list of things ill never understand
like collecting shrunken indian heads
of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet peace and quit is for libraries
the car swerves suddenly and slightly
lloyd be careful
just a little skid thats all
this roads like glass
karen and i just dont want an accident i have no intention of having an accident
its not important whether you do
we are wearing long underwear
they all laugh
suddenly the car slows and stops with that hissing sound that can mean only one thing no gas
now whats this
he tries to start it again
he turns on the dashboard lights
the gas gauge reads empty
but it cant be
we cant be out of gas
i filled it myself yesterday
to karen wasnt it full when you drove to brewster this morning
very low i guess i didnt look
you know i dont pay attention to those things
futilely he runs the started again
crisply how much time have we
roughly ten minutes
how far to the station
three or four miles
any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas
looking none in sight there arent many along this back road
not many car either not much chance of a lift
a moment of silence
no sense my just sitting here
im going to walk up about half a mile just in case
he starts out of the car
the cold comes in like a knife the women react
youll break your neck on that ice
grins what a way to die trying to get an actress to the theater in time
tell max i want to be buried with royalties
dont joke about such things
quietly how fortunate that i have an understudy so ready so willing and so able to go on
the audience will want its money refunded believe me
thank you lloyd
lloyd starts down the road
he slips once recovers waves and keeps going
he always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical it seems to me that walking for most people is not very dangerous
smiles i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down
hell come back with or without gas
they tuck the fur car robe around them
margo turns on the radio
do you want it on
it doesnt matter
i detest cheap sentiment
she turns it off
karen says hm
i havent been pleasant this weekend
weve all seemed a little tense lately
come to think of it i havent been very pleasant for weeks
for that im truly sorry
more than any two people i know i dont want you and lloyd to be angry with me
were never deeply angry we just get sore
the way you do
we know you too well
so many people know me
i wish i did
i wish someone would tell be about me
and what is that
besides something spelled out in light bulbs i mean
besides something called temperament which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice
infants behave the way i do you know
they carry on and misbehave theyd get drunk if they knew how when they cant have what they want
when they feel unwanted and insecure or unloved
theres a pause
what about bill
what about bill
hes in love with you
more than anything in this world i love bill
and i want bill
i want him to want me
not margo channing
and if i cant tell they apart how can he
why should he and why should you
bills in love with margo channing
hes fought with her worked with her loved her
but ten years from now margo channing will have ceased to exist
and whats left will be
bill is all of eight years younger than you
those years stretch as the years go on
ive seen it happen too often
not to you
not to bill
isnt that what they always say
she turns the radio on again
a piano nocturne
i dont suppose the heater runs when the motor doesnt
silly isnt it
youd think theyd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm
margo nods get some cigarettes out of her bag
she offers one to karen
they light up
ive acted pretty disgracefully toward her too
lets not fumble for excuses not here and now with my hair down
at best lets say ive been oversensitive to
well to the fact that shes so young so feminine and helpless
to so many things i want to be for bill
funny business a womans career
the things you drop on your way up the ladder so you can move faster
you forget youll need them again when you go back to being a woman
thats one career all females have in common whether we like it or not being a woman
sooner or later weve all got to work at it no matter what other careers weve had or wanted
and in the last analysis nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed and there he is
without that youre not woman
youre something with a french provincial office or a book full of clippings but youre not a woman
she smiles at karen slow curtain
there are tears in karens eyes
she hesitates margo i want you to know how sorry i am about this
indicating their predicament this
i cant tell you how sorry i am
dont give it another thought one of destinys many pranks
after all you didnt personally drain the gasoline out of the tank
she snuggles down into her furs
karen flashes an unhappy look at her
she too snuggles down
the snow has been shoveled to either side of the alley making a lane
the performance is just over
addison his back to us stands looking toward the stage door
a few actors on their way out
eve of course was superb
many of the audience understandably preferred to return another time to see margo
but those who remained cheered loudly lustily and long for eve
how thoughtful of her to call and invite me that afternoon
he starts to walk toward the stage door
and what a happy coincidence that several representatives of other newspapers happened to be present
all of us invited that afternoon to attend an understudys performance
he goes in the stage door
more activity than last time the performance being just over
addison comes through the door picks his way toward margos dressing room
about which the management knew nothing until they were forced to ring up the curtain at nine oclock
also every indication of intrigue skulduggery and fraud
the door tot he dressing room is open just a bit
addison pauses beside the door to listen
from within you were better than all right kid you gave a performance you rang a bell addison uses his cane to swing the door open farther so that both
he and we can see as well as hear
bill faces eve who wears margos costume
she is a ravishing sight
her eyes shine up to his radiantly continuing little things here and there it doesnt matter
you can be proud of yourself youve got a right to be
quietly are you proud of me bill
ill admit i was worried when max called
i had my doubts
you shouldnt have had any doubts
after all the other day was one scene the woods are full of one scene sensations
but you did it
with work and patience youll be a fine actress
if thats what you want to be
is that what you want me to be
im talking about you
and what you want
so am i
what have i got to do with it
lightly the names ive been called
but never svengali
he pats her shoulder good luck
he starts out
dont run away bill
stops from what would i be running
youre always after truth on the stage
what about off
curiously im for it
then face it
since that first night here in the dressing room
smiles when i told you what every young actress should know
when you told me that whatever i became it would be because of you your make ups a little heavy
and for you
slowly youre quite a girl
im in love with margo
hadnt you heard
you hear all kinds of things
im only human rumors to the contrary
and im as curious as the next man
deliberately only thing what i go after i want to go after
i dont want it to come after me
tears come to eves eyes
she turns away slowly
just score it as an incomplete forward pass
he walks out
addison ducks to avoid being seen
eve glares after bill tears the wig from her head throws it on the dressing table
her glance is caught by a pair of scissors
swiftly she snatches them up and in a sharp vicious gesture she slashes the wig
addison knocks politely at the door
may i come in
entering i expected to find this little room overcrowded with a theater full of people at your feet
i consider myself lucky they didnt throw things
she starts creaming her face removing make up
of course your performance was no surprise to me
after the other day i regarded it as no more than a promised fulfilled
youre more than kind
but its still miss channings performance
im just a carbon copy you read when you cant find the original
youre more than modest
its not modesty
i just dont try to kid myself
a revolutionary approach to the theater
however if i may a suggestion
i think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility
it is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly
i dont think ive done anything to sound off about
we all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns
if we dont blow them who will
one isolated pretty good performance by an understudy
itll be forgotten tomorrow
it neednt be
even if i wanted to as you say be less humble blow my own horn
how would i do it
im less than nobody
i am somebody
she eyes him steadily
you certainly are
she goes into the bathroom
leave the door open a bit so we can talk
eve does so
after you change if youre not busy elsewhere we can have supper
from the bathroom id love to
or should i pretend im busy
smiling lets have a minimum of pretending
ill want to do a column about you im not enough for a paragraph
perhaps more than one
theres so much i want to know
ive heard your story in bits and pieces
your home in wisconsin your tragic marriage your financial attachment to margo it started in san francisco didnt it
no answer addison smiles i say your idolatry of margo started in san francisco didnt it
an oasis of civilization in the california desert
tell me do you share my high opinion of san francisco
and that memorable night when margo first dazzled you from the stage which theater was it in san francisco
was it the shubert
a slight pause yes
grins happily a fine old theater the shubert
full of tradition untouched by the earthquake so sorry fire
by the way what was your husbands name
eve sticks her head and naked shoulder around the door
im about to go into the shower i wont be able to hear you
i can wait
where would you like to go
well make this a special night
trustingly you take charge
i believe i will
she closes the door
he leans back lights a cigarette
a cab drives up to
some of the morning papers carried a little squib about eves performance
not much but full praise
i couldnt imagine how they found out about it but lloyd said maxs publicity man probably sent out the story
karen gets out of the cab pays and goes in
at any rate i feel terribly guilty and ashamed of myself and wanted nothing so much as to forget the whole thing
margo and i were having lunch at just like girlfriends with hats on
karen consults her watch and the doorman as she enters
has miss channing come in
not yet mrs
karen sees eve who waits as addison hands his hat coat and cane to an attendant
she smiles crosses to her
ive heard the most wonderful things about your performance mostly relief that i managed to stagger through it at all
she was magnificent
pleased then youve heard too
i was there
staggered you were there
at the play last night
smiles a happy coincidence
quickly were having lunch with a movie talent scout
they certainly dont waste much time
nothing definite yet its just to have lunch
theyll be wasting this much of their time at any rate
eve has no intention of going to hollywood
he turns to karen changing the subject
from the smartness of your dress i take it your luncheon companion is a lady
lunching in public
its new margo
but shes just as late as the old one
she may be later than you think
as he speaks he crosses to pick up an evening paper opens it as he comes back
handing it to her why not read my column to pass the time
the minutes will fly like hours
he takes eves arm and now we must join our sunburned eager beaver
he goes up the stairs with eve
karen glances after them curiously then at the column
it is headed things i promised not to tell by addison dewitt
he expression becomes increasingly horrified
she drops the paper and rushes out
addisons column quivers in margos hand as she strides about reading it
karen sits miserably
my hat which has lo these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears is lifted to miss harrington
i am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops
i thought that one went out with woollcott
she skips part of the column down here
here listen to this
miss harrington had much to tell and these columns shall report her faithfully about the lamentable practice in our theater of permitting shall we say mature actresses to continue playing
roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory i just cant believe it
it get better
about the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched first ladies of the stage to encourage shall we say younger actresses about miss harringtons own long and unsupported struggle
for opportunity i cant believe eve said those things
margo crumples the paper as if it were eves neck
pacing in this rat race everybodys guilty till theyre proved innocent
one of the differences between the theater and civilization
she hurls the paper away what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance
weakly lloyd says its a publicity release
the little witch must have had indians runners out snatching critics out of bars steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up
well she wont get away with it
nor will addison dewitt and his poison pen
if equity or my lawyer cant or wont do anything about it i will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down mr
dewitts ugly throat
she pauses in midair to look at
he has come up the stairs tow at a time stands at the landing
quietly i came as soon as i read that piece of filth
i ran all the way
margo suddenly starts to cry
she turns from him
bill takes her in his arms
he holds her
bills here baby
everythings all right now
margo says nothing just hides in his embrace
he soothes her pets her
he looks over at karen
i guess at this point im what the french call de trop
smiles maybe just a little around the edges
karen smiles back waves and goes out
karens having some lunch
lloyd still in his robe sits opposite her having some coffee and a cigarette
a copy of the interview before him
is saying its addison from start to finish it drips with his brand of venom
taking advantage of a kid like that twisting her words making her say what he wanted her to say whered you get all that information
put out his cigarette eve
shes been to see me as a matter of fact she left just before you came in you just missed her
that was a pity
gets up she wanted to explain about her interview wanted to apologize to someone and didnt dare face margo
i wonder why
lloyd wanders about he seems to be searching for words for a position to maintain
she started to tell me all about it and she couldnt finish she cried so
hes over by a window his back to her
karen eyes him curiously waiting for the payoff
finally you know ive been going over our financial condition if youll pardon the expression
thats quite a change of subject
walks again what with taxes coming up and since im a playwright and not an oil well operator well ive been thinking
im trying hard to follow you
if instead of waiting until next season to do footsteps on the ceiling which is in pretty good shape and if margo can be talked into going on tour with
aged in wood we could put footsteps
into production right away
im beginning to catch up
if we could cast it properly that is
carefully maybe get some younger actress for the part
someone whod look the part as well as play it
smiles youve got to admit it would be a novelty
now youre quoting addison
eve did mention the play you know
but just in passing shes never ask to play a part like cora shed never have the nerve
eve would ask abbott to give her costello
no i got the idea myself while she was talking to me
with gestures of course
wistfully for once to write something and have it realized completely
for once not to compromise now karen explodes
lloyd richards you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of cora
now just a minute margo channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise
angry now just a minute
it strikes me that eves disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious
lloyds full of anger and guilt
he snaps back
all this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named dewitt
she apologized didnt she
on her knees i have no doubt
very touching very academy of dramatic arts
that bitter cynicism of yours is something youve acquired since you left radcliffe
the cynicism you refer to i acquired the day i discovered i was different from little boys
the phone has been ringing
lloyd snarls into it
he quiets down hi margo
no not at all karen and i were just chatting
why why yes im sure we can and im sure wed love to
see you then
he hangs up
he smiles suddenly theres peace
margo and bill want us to meet them at the cub room tonight after theater
for a bottle of wine
smiles margo in the cub room
i couldnt be more surprised if shed said grants tomb
im glad bills back
theyd die without each other
darling i didnt promise eve anything
just said i thought shed be fine for the part but there were some practical difficulties
grins you for one
i told her you were set on margo playing the part and i certainly wouldnt make a change without your approval
karen smiles happily
fine and dandy
id enjoy nothing more
just refer all of miss harringtons future requests to me
margo karen bill and lloyd are ensconced happily at a table in the rear of the room
a bottle of fine wine is being poured
their mood is equally bubbly
the so called art of acting is not one for which i have a particularly high regard
but you may quote me as follows
tonight miss margo channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play the like of which i have never seen before and expect rarely to see again
he does not exaggerate
i was good
you were great
as they look at each other they reflect the understanding that has hit them both at last
its been quite a night
i understand that your understudy miss harrington has given her notice
eyes still on bill too bad
eyes still on margo im broken up about it
the wine has been poured by now
for some reason you cant just pick up champagne and drink it
somebodys got to be very witty about a toast
he lifts his glass for instance
abruptly im going to propose the toast
with all my heart
lloyd lowers his glass
theres a little pause
to my bride to be
well of all margo
they drink then burst into a flurry of questions
when are you going to do it
tomorrow we meet at city hall at ten to margo and youre going to be on time
city hall thats for prize fighters and reporters i see a cathedral a bishop banks of flowers
its only for the license
theres a three day wait blood tests things like that
ill marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all
three days thats for the bourgeois i see a midnight elopement waking up a village person
to margo what are you going to wear
a fur coat over a nightgown
the point is in the cathedral a ball park or a penny arcade we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends
lloyd fills all the glasses
there are very few moments in life as good as this
lets remember it
he lifts his glass to each of us and all of us
never have we been more close may we never be farther apart
a waiter approaches with a note
karen stares at it curiously then opens it
a note right out in the open like that
next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings or tap a glass
lloyd i want you to be big about this
the world is full of love tonight no woman is safe
angrily this beats all worlds records for running standing and jumping gall
she whips the note to margo who reads it aloud
reading please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion but its most important that i speak with you
please its underlined meet me in the ladies room
i understand she is now the understudy in there
looking about pass me the empty bottle
i may find her
addison sits near the entrance at a banquette table for two
a crumpled napkin and a wine glass indicate eves place
he nibbles daintily at some blini
margo hails a passing captain
encore du champagne
more champagne miss channing
thats what i said bub
to karen after all maybe she just wants to apologize
i have no possible interest in anything shed have to say
but what could she say
thats what fascinates me
go on find out
karen in all the years of our friendship i have never let you go to the ladies room alone
but now i must
i am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there
she gets up and goes
the camera takes her past addisons table
he rises in polite surprise
she walks past him without a word
he smiles looks toward the group
he raises his glass in a toast
margo responds to the toast by waving an onion with a grand flourish then eating it
but why take it out on me
he eats one in self defense
never having been i cant say what it looks like
it is to be hoped that there is an outer and inner room
we are concerned with the outer
there is an attendant in charge and a constantly changing flow of ladies who pause to make various repairs
all cafe society including one young drunk stretched out under a mink coat and a wet towel
there are two chairs or a banquette in a corner
eve waits there
she rises as karen approaches
i was wondering whether youd come at all
dont get up
she smiles grimly and dont act as if i were the queen mother
i dont expect you to be pleasant
i dont intend to be
cant we sit down
just for a minute
she sits down
karen remains standing
ive got a lot to say
and none of it is easy
there cant be very much oh but there is and easy or not i wont believe a word
why shouldnt you
a pause please sit down
karen sits reluctantly and rigidly
you know ive always considered myself a very clever girl
good head on my shoulders that sort of thing never the wrong word at the wrong time
but then id never met addison dewitt
another pause i remember once i had a tooth pulled
they gave me some anaesthetic i dont remember the name and it affected me in a strange way
i heard myself saying things i wasnt even thinking
as if my mind were someplace outside of my body and couldnt control what i did or said leading her on and you felt just like that talking to addison
nods in a way
you find yourself trying to say what you mean but somehow the words change and they become his words and suddenly youre not saying what you mean but what he
means sharply do you expect me to believe that you didnt say any of those things that they were all addison
i dont expect you to believe anything
except that the responsibility is mine
and the disgrace
lets not get over dramatic
smiles grimly youve really got a low opinion of me havent you
well ill give you some pleasant news
ive been told off in no uncertain terms all over town
miss channing should be happy to hear that
to know how loyal her friends are how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be
she turns away from karen
turned away im not crying
how did your lunch turn out with the man from hollywood
some vague promises of a test thats all if a particular part should come along one of those things but the raves about your performance an understudys performance
i think youre painting the picture a little darker than it is really
if nothing else and dont underestimate him you have a powerful friend in addison
hes not my friend
you were my friends
he can help you
i wish id never met him id like him to be dead
i want my friends back
this time she does cry
karen looks about
she puts an arm around eve
i i dont think you meant to cause unhappiness
but you did
more to yourself perhaps as it turned out than to anyone else
ill never get over it
smiles yes you will
you theater people always do
nothing is forever in the theater
love or hate success or failure whatever it is its here it flares up and burns hot and then its gone
i wish i could believe that
give yourself time
dont worry too much about what people think youre very young and very talented
she gets up her hand still on eves shoulder and believe it or not if theres anything i can do eve has reached up to take karens hand
she holds it now as she turns slowly to face her
there is something
karen stares down at her
eves eyes burn into tears
karen is caught fascinated by them
i think i know
something most important you can do
you want to play cora
you want me to tell lloyd i think you should play it
if you told him so hed give me the part
he said he would
after all youve said
dont you know the part was written for margo
it could have been fifteen years ago
its my part now
you talk just as addison said you did
cora is my part
youve got to tell lloyd its for me
i dont think anything in the world could make me say that
she turns away again but eves grip is like a vise
addison wants me to play it
over my dead body
cold relentless that wont be necessary
addison knows how margo happen to miss that performance how i happened to know shed miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town
karen stops struggling its quite a story
addison could make quite a thing of it imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth
i had a time persuading him
she smiles now youd better sit down
you look a bit wobbly
karen sits if i play cora addison will never tell what happened in or out of print
a simple exchange of favors
and im so happy i can do something for you at long last
karen covers her face with her hands your friendship with margo your deep close friendship what would happen to it do you think if she knew the chap trick youd
played on her for my benefit
and you and lloyd how long even in the theater before people forgot what happened and trusted you again
now eve gets up no
it would be so much easier on everyone concerned if i were to play cora
and so much better theater too
karen looks up slowly
a part in a play
youd do all that just for a part in a play
smiles id do much more for a part that good
karen is alone
eve enters and slides in beside addison
just some coffee
pours im not surprised
after all that humble pie
nothing of the kind
karen and i had a nice talk
heart to heart
woman to woman
including a casual reference to the part of cora and your hopes of playing it
i discussed it very openly
i told her that i had spoken to lloyd and that he was interested
she mentioned of course that margo expects to play the part
oddly enough she didnt say a word about margo
just that shell be happy to do what she can to see that i play the part
addison puffs at his cigarette bemused
just like that eh
just like that
thoughtfully do you know eve sometimes i think you keep things from me
eves feelings are hurt
i dont think thats funny
it wasnt meant to be
i confide in you and rely on you more than anyone ive ever known
to say a thing like that now without any reason when i need you more than ever
breaks in i hope you mean what you say eve
i intend to hold you to it
their eyes meet
we have a great deal in common it seems to me
they both look as karen passes them on her way back to her table
group as karen joins them
another bottle of champagne has come and almost gone theres a fine cheery feeling among them
margo in particular is cheery
karen downs a glass of champagne
but not right away
first the business of fighting them off chin up stout fella
very classy stuff lots of technique you mean all this time shed done nothing but apologize
whatd you say
groom bill says huh
may i have a wedding present
what would you like
i want everybody to shut up about eve
just shut up about eve thats all i want
give karen more wine
blissfully never have i been so happy
isnt this a lovely room
the cub room
what a lovely clever name
where the elite meet
never have i seen so much elite and all with their eyes on me
waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle
but not tonight
i forgive eve
there they go
they all look
addison and eve they get up and go without looking back
group they watch for an instant
there goes eve
eve evil little miss evil
but the evil that men do how does it go groom
something about the good they leave behind i played it once in rep in wilkes barre
youve got it backwards
even for wilkes barre
you know why i forgive eve
because shes left good behind the four of us together like this its eves fault i forgive her
karens reactions are of course most important
knowing what shes done to margo wondering how to do what she must
eve did that too
you know she probably means well after all
she is a louse
to lloyd never try to outguess margo
you know what im going to be
a married lady
with the paper to prove it
im going to have a home
not just a house im afraid to stay in
and a man to go with it
ill look up at six oclock and there hell be
quietly i remember
to bill youll be there wont you
grins often enough to keep the franchise
a foursquare upright downright forthright married lady
thats for me
and no more make believe
off stage or on
lloyd nods i mean it now
grown up women only i might even play a mother only one child of course not over eight
they all smile lloyd will you promise not to be angry with me
smiles that depends
i mean really deeply angry
i dont think i could be
i dont want to play cora
margo misinterprets her vehemence
hastily now wait a minute youre always so touchy about his plays it isnt the part its a great part
and a fine play
but not for me anymore not a foursquare upright downright forthright married lady
whats your being married got to do with it
it means ive finally got a life to live
i dont have to play parts im too old for just because ive got nothing to do with my nights
then quietly i know youve made plans
ill make it up to you believe me
ill tour a year with this one anything only you do understand dont you lloyd
lloyd never gets to answer
because karen before anyone can stop her bursts into hysterical laughter
whats so funny
everythings so funny
margo removes the champagne glass from in front of karen
karen is seated unobtrusively in a rear lower box
lloyd sits beside max up front
on stage the play is on its feet
eve plays a dramatic scene with a young man
they carry sides but do not consult them
as she speaks eve moves upstage turns to face the young man who is forced to turn his back to the auditorium
bill calls a halt
he indicates to eve that she was to have remained downstage
eve seems to be at a loss
she looks at lloyd
lloyd rises says that he told her to make the change
bill comes down to the footlights to tell him to stick to writing hell do the directing
it mounts swiftly to a screaming fight
bill throws the script out into the auditorium takes his coat and stalks off
eve runs after him
max retrieves the script
lloyd remains adamant
karen has risen in dismay
eve drags bill back
without looking at lloyd he takes the script from max tells the actors to pick up where they left off
eve whispers to lloyd from the stage
lloyd smiles mollified sits down again with max
karen walks up the side aisle out of the theater
lloyd never got around somehow to asking me whether it was all right with me for eve to play cora
bill oddly enough refused to direct the play at first with eve in it
lloyd and max finally won him over
margo never came to a rehearsal too much to do around the house she said
id never known bill and lloyd to fight as bitterly and as often
and always over some business for eve or a move or the way she read a speech
but then id never known lloyd to meddle as much with bills directing as far as it affected eve that is
somehow eve kept them going
bill stuck it out and lloyd seemed happy and i thought it might be best if i skipped rehearsals from then on
it is a lovely large room
two double beds not alongside each other and each with an extension phone beside it
in addition to the door to the living room there are two more to separate dressing rooms and baths
lloyd is asleep
but not karen
she turns restlessly finally sits up lights a cigarette
it seemed to me i had known always that it would happen and here it was
it felt helpless that helplessness you feel when you have no talent to offer outside of loving your husband
how could i compete
everything lloyd loved about me he had gotten used to long ago
the phone jangles suddenly startling her
it wakes lloyd up
whos calling mr
a girl in a wrapper at a wall phone
her hairs in curlers
my name wouldnt mean anything
i room across the hall from eve harrington and she isnt well
shes been crying all night and hysterical and she doesnt want a doctor
richards bedroom lloyd is sitting on the edge of the bed looking over
who is it
whats it all about
into phone did miss harrington tell you to call mr
lloyd picks up his phone
no eve didnt say to call him but i remembered i saw mr
richards with her a couple of times and i thought they being such good friends
into phone hello
hello this is lloyd richards
where is eve
let me talk to her shes up in her room mr
i really hate to bother you like this but the way eves been feeling im just worried sick what with her leaving for new haven tomorrow and everything
tell her not to worry tell her ill be right over
ill tell her mr
she hangs up
as she moves from the phone the angle widens to disclose eve at the foot of the stairs
the girls smile at each other
they go upstairs arm in arm
richards bedroom karen is still in bed phone still in her hand
she hangs up swings her legs out puts out her cigarette gets into a robe
the open door and light of the dressing room tell us where lloyd is
karen walks to the door starts to say something changes her mind
she crosses to a table lights a fresh cigarette comes back to the door
finally arent you
broadening the duties of a playwright just a bit
rushing off in the middle of the night like a country doctor
no answer except the opening and closing of drawers
what would you do if instead of eve the leading man had called up to say her was hysterical
still no answer
her tension increasing karen goes back to the table snubs out the fresh cigarette then strides swiftly back to the open door
lloyd i dont want you to go
now lloyd appears
hes in flannels and a sport shirt with no tie
hes confused and guilty and tortured
i didnt think you would
it seems to me karen that for some tine now youve been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general im a human being ive got
goes right on and for my feelings in particular
for my play my career and now for a frightened hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the theater
he goes back into his room
have you forgotten about eve
what she is what shes done
old wives tales born of envy and jealousy
and a phobia against truth
then tell me this isnt true
that your concern for your play and career is one thing and that poor frightened hysterical girl another and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either
your play or your career
lloyd comes out wearing a jacket
he crosses to the door karen after him
that first last and foremost your reason for going now is that you want to be with eve
three in the morning or high noon play or no play wife or no wife
lloyd stops at the door isnt it true lloyd
lloyd goes out
karen looks after him despairing
the theater is but a few doors from the taft hotel
the marquee announces a new play by lloyd richards presented by max fabian opening tonight
addison and eve stand before the theater admiring her photo on a lobby display
none of the actors are starred
to the theater world new haven connecticut is a short stretch of sidewalk between the shubert theater and the taft hotel surrounded by what looks very much like a small
it is here that managers have what are called out of town openings which are openings for new yorkers who want to go out of town
they start for the hotel eves arm through addisons
what a day what a heavenly day
just like it
and tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of immortality
grins stop rehearsing your column
isnt it strange addison
i thought id be panic stricken want to run away or something
instead i cant wait for tonight to come
to come and go
are you that sure of tomorrow
theyve arrived in front of the hotel
itll be a night to remember
itll bring to me everything ive ever wanted
the end of an old road and the beginning of a new one
all paved with diamonds and gold
you know me better than that
paved with what then
she goes in
addison follows her
addison accompanies eve along the corridor to her door
plenty of time for a nice long nap we rehearsed most of last night
you could sleep too couldnt you
theyve arrived at her door
she opens it
the mark of a true killer
he holds out his hand sleep tight rest easy and come out fighting
whyd call me a killer
did i say killer
i meant champion
i get my boxing terms mixed
he turns to go
after a few steps calling addison he pauses come on in for just a minute wont you
ive got something to tell you
addison turns curiously and enters behind her
old fashioned dreary and small
the action starts in the living room and continues to the bedroom
addison closes the door crosses to a comfortable chair
suites are for expense accounts
arent you being extravagant
max is paying for it
he and lloyd had a terrific row but lloyd insisted
can i fix you a drink
she indicates a table elaborately stocked with liquor glasses etc
addisons eyebrows lift
also with the reluctant compliments of max fabian
i never have any and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish so he sent it up
some plain soda
eve starts to fix it lloyd must be expecting a record run in new haven
thats for tonight
were having everyone up after the performance
lloyd and i
she carries the soda to him sits on an ottoman at his feet
i find it odd that karen isnt here for the opening dont you
he sips his soda and puts away carefully avoiding a look at eve
as he looks back addison
blandly shes always been so fantastically devoted to lloyd
i would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her breaks in addison just a few minutes ago
when i told you this would be a night to remember that it would bring me everything i wanted nods something about an old road ending and a new one
starting paved with stars
i didnt mean just the theater
eve gets up crosses to look out over the common
her back to him lloyd richards
hes going to leave karen
were going to be married
for just a flash addisons eyes narrow coldly viciously
then they crinkle into a bland smile
so thats it
still just the theater after all
turns shocked its nothing of the kind
lloyd loves me i love him
i know nothing about lloyd and his loves i leave those to louisa may alcott
but i do know you
im in love with lloyd
lloyd richards is commercially the most successful playwright in america you have no right to say such things
and artistically the most promising
eve dear this is addison
eve drops her shocked manner like a cape
her face lights up she crosses back to the ottoman
addison wont it be just perfect
lloyd and i theres no telling how far we can go
hell write great plays for me ill make them be great
as she sits youre the only one ive told the only one that knows except lloyd and me
she doesnt know
she knows enough not to be here
but not all of it not that lloyd and i are going to be married
thoughtfully i see
and when was this unholy alliance joined
we decided the night before last before we came up here
increasingly tense was the setting properly romantic the lights on dimmers gypsy violins off stage
the setting wasnt romantic but lloyd was
he woke me up at three in the morning banging on my door he couldnt sleep he told me hes left karen he couldnt go on with the play or
anything else until i promised to marry him
we sat and talked until it was light
he never went home
you sat and talked until it was light
meaningly we sat and talked addison
i want a run of the play contract
quietly there never was therell never be another like you
happily well say something anything
congratulations skol good work eve
addison rises slowly to his full height
as eve watches him as her eyes go up to his her smile fades what do you take me for
cautiously i dont know what i take you for anything
moving away it is possible even conceivable that youve confused me with that gang of backward children youve been playing tricks on that you have the same contempt for me
that you have for them
im sure you mean something by that addison but i dont know what
look closely eve its time you did
i am addison dewitt
im nobodys fool
least of all yours
i never intended you to be
yes you did
you still do
eve gets up now
i still dont know what youre getting at
right now i want to take my nap
its important that i breaks in its important right now that we talk
killer to killer
wisely champion to champion
not with me youre no champion
youre stepping way up in class
addison will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly and then get out so i can take my nap
very well plainly and distinctly
although i consider it unnecessary because you know as well as i what i am about to say
they are now facing each other lloyd may leave karen but he will not leave karen for you
what do you mean by that
more plainly and more distinctly
i have not come to new haven to see the play discuss your dreams or to pull the ivy from the walls of yale
i have come to tell you that you will not marry lloyd or anyone else because i will not permit it
what have you got to do with it
because after tonight you will belong to me
i cant believe my ears
a dull cliche
belong to you
that sound medieval something out of an old melodrama
so does the history of the world for the past twenty years
i dont enjoy putting it as bluntly as this frankly i had hoped that you would somehow have known have taken it for granted that you and taken it for
that you and i
then she chuckles then laughs
addison slaps her sharply across the face
quietly remember as long as you live never to laugh at me
at anything or anyone else but never at me
eve eyes him coldly goes to the door throws it open
addison walks to the door closes it
youre too short for that gesture
besides it went out with mrs
then if you wont get out ill have you thrown out
she goes to the phone
dont pick it up
dont even put your hand on it
her back is to him
something told you to do as i say didnt it
that instinct is worth millions you cant buy it cherish it eve
when that alarm goes off go to your battle stations
he comes up behind her
eve is tense and wary
your name is not eve harrington
it is gertrude slescynski
what of it
it is true that your parents were poor
they still are
and they would like to know how you are and where
they havent heard from you for three years
curtly what of it
she walks away
addison eyes her keenly
a matter of opinion
it is also true that you worked in a brewery
but life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it
as a matter of fact it got less and less dull until you bosss wife had your boss followed by detectives
whirls on him she never proved anything not a thing
but the you got to get out of town brought you straight to new york didnt it
eve turns and runs into the bedroom slamming the door
addison opens it follows close after her
he can be seen in the bedroom shouting at eve who is offscene
that brought you straight to new york didnt it
eve trapped in a corner of the room
she was a liar she was a liar
answer my question
werent you paid to get out of town
eve throws herself on the bed face down bursts in tears
addison merciless moves closer
there was no eddie no pilot and youve never been married
that was not only a lie but an insult to dead heroes and to the women who loved them
eve sobbing puts her hands over her ears addison closer pulls them away fifth
san francisco has no shubert theater and north shore youve never been to san francisco
that was a stupid lie easy to expose not worthy of you
eve twists to look up at him her eyes streaming
i had to get in to meet margo
i had to say something be somebody make her like me
she did like you she helped and trusted you
you paid her back by trying to take bill away
thats not true
i was there i saw you and heard you through the dressing room door
eve turns face down again sobbing miserably
you used my name and my column to blackmail karen into getting you the part of cora and you lied to me about it
into the bed no no no
i had lunch with karen not three hours ago
as always with women who want to find out things she told more than she learned
he lets go of her hands do you want to change your story about lloyd beating at your door the other night
eve covers her face with her hands
addison get off the bed looks down at her
that i should want you at all suddenly strikes me as the height of improbability
but that in itself is probably the reason
youre an improbable person eve and so am i
we have that in common
also a contempt for humanity an inability to love or be loved insatiable ambition and talent
we deserve each other
are you listening to me
eve lies listlessly now her tear stained cheek against the coverlet
then say so
and you realize you agree how completely you belong to me
take your nap now
and good luck for tonight
he starts out
tonelessly i wont play tonight
addison pauses i couldnt
i couldnt go on
smiles couldnt go on
youll give the performance of your life
he goes out
the camera remains on eves forlorn tear stained face
her eyes close
she goes to sleep
the stopped action of eve reaching out for the award
the applause and bulb popping still going on
and she gave the performance of her life
and it was a night to remember that night
the action picks up where it left off
eve accepts the award from the aged actor kisses him tenderly folds the award to her bosom and waits for quiet
she speaks with assurance yet modestly and humbly
honored members of sarah siddons society distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen what is there for me to say
everything wise and witty has long since been said by minds more mature and talents far greater than mine
for me to thank you as equals would be presumptuous i am an apprentice in the theater and have much to learn from you all
i can say only that i am proud and happy and that i regard this great honor not so much as an award for what i have achieved but as
a standard to hold against what i have yet to accomplish
applause and further i regard it as bestowed upon me only in part
the larger share belongs to my friends in the theater and to the theater itself which has given me all i have
in good conscience i must give credit where credit is due
to max fabian max sits erect beaming proudly
dear sentimental generous courageous max fabian who took a chance on an unknown untried amateur
eve after applause greets max
and to my first friend in the theater whose kindness and graciousness i shall never forget
karen resumes her doodling as applause breaks out for her
and it was karen who first brought me to one whom i had always idolized and who was to become my benefactor and champion
a great actress and a great woman margo channing
margo part of eves tribute has been over her close up
she smiles grimly in reaction to the applause
eve looks to her right waits for the applause to die
my director who demanded always a little more than my talent could provide bill seated at the speakers table
he has his award before him a smaller one
he puts out a cigarette expressionlessly as the applause breaks out
but who taught me patiently and well
lloyd sits beside bill
he too has a smaller award
as eve speaks he throws her a brief glance
and one without whose great play and faith in me this night would never have been
how can i repay lloyd richards
eve waits for the applause to die
hoe can i repay the many others
so many that i couldnt possibly name them all
addison smiles approvingly
whose help guidance and advice have made this the happiest night of my life possible
eve stares at the award for an instant as if fighting for self control
although i am going to hollywood next week to make a film do not think for a moment that i am leaving you
how could i
for my heart is here in the theater and three thousand miles are too far to be away from ones heart
ill be back to claim it and soon
that is if you want me back
another storm of applause
much ad lib shouting as bill and lloyd are summoned to pose beside her for more pictures
people are thronging out
the aged actor shouts above the hubbub
a good night to all and to all a good night
eve disengages herself from the photographers makes her way toward addisons table
bill and lloyd follow
camera follows lloyd to karen
he gives her the award
for services rendered beyond the whatever it is of duty darling
max bustles into the shot
im the host i gotta get home before the guests start stealing the liquor
she and lloyd follow max
addison and eve are on their way
lloyd goes right by
karen pauses at eve
thank you karen
eve is being constantly congratulated
some ad lib about seeing her at maxs party
to addison im giving her a very high class party
it aint like a rehearsal she dont have to be late
as soon as the peasants stop pawing her
max hurries out
margo and bill step into the shot
eve turns from a well wisher to face her
nice speech eve
but i wouldnt worry too much about your heart
you can always put that award where your heart ought to be
eve looks at her wordlessly
margo and bill leave
addison and eve are alone
the tables about them are empty
suddenly her face becomes expressionless her eyes dull
she glances at the table
i dont suppose theres a drink left
you can have one at maxs
sits i dont think im going
sighs why not
because i dont want to
patiently max has gone to a great deal of trouble its going to be an elaborate party and its for you
no its not
she holds up the award its for this
its the same thing isnt it
she gives him the award here
take it to the party instead of me
youre being childish
a well wisher rushes up to eve with an eve darling im so happy
eve rises thanks her graciously
then she pulls her wrap over her shoulder
i want to go home
curtly very well
i shall drop you and go on to the party
i have no intention of missing it
they exit from the room now empty of everything but tables waiters and the usual banquet debris
eve gets out of taxi in front of a fashionable apartment hotel
she doesnt say good night to addison she enters the hotel as the cab drives off
she hasnt the award with her
smart but not gaudy
eve crosses from the elevator to her apartment
she lets herself in
a small foyer from which one door leads to the leaving room another to the bedroom
the bedroom and living room do not connect except through the foyer
all the lights are out
eve turns them on in the foyer the same as she enters the bedroom
there are some new trunks in various stages of being packed
eve tosses her wrap on the bed goes through the foyer to the living room
she turns on the light in the living room
camera follows her to a smart small bar where she fixes a stiff drink
as she turns from the bar she stares starts in fright and drops the drink
a young girl asleep in a chair wakes with a jump
she stares at eve horror stricken
who are you
what are you doing here
i i guess i fell asleep
eve starts for the phone
the girl rises in panic
please dont have me arrested please
i didnt steal anything you can search me
pauses how did you get in here
i hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed
she mustve forgot something and when she went to get it she left the door open
i sneaked in and hid till she finished
then i just looked around and pretty soon i was afraid somebodyd notice the lights were on so i turned them off and then i guess i fell asleep
you were just looking around
you probably wont believe me
it was for my report
about how you live what kind of clothes you wear what kind of perfume and books things like that
you know the eve harrington clubs that theyve got in most of the girls high schools
ive heard of them
ours was one of the first
im the president
thats in brooklyn isnt it
lots of actresses come from brooklyn
barbara stanwyck susan hayward of course theyre just movie stars
eve makes no comment
she lies wearily on the couch
youre going to hollywood arent you
eve murmurs uh huh from the trunks youre packing you must be going to stay a long time
that spilled drink is going to ruin your carper
she crosses to it
the maidll fix it in the morning
ill just pick up the broken glass
the girl puts the broken glass on the bar
she starts to mix eve a fresh drink
howd you get all the way up here from brooklyn
how long does it take
with changing and everything a little over an hour
she carries the drink over to eve
its after one now
you wont get home till all hours
smiles i dont care if i never get home
the door buzzer sounds
thats the door
ill get it
she goes to the door opens it
addison stands there the sarah siddons award in his hands
who are you
shyly miss harringtons resting mr
she asked me to see who it is
we wont disturb her rest
it seems she left her award in the taxicab
will you give it to her
she holds it as if it were the promised land
addison smiles faintly
he knows the look
how do you know my name
its a very famous name mr
and what is your name
stubbornly i call myself phoebe
tell me phoebe do you want some day to have an award like that of your own
phoebe lifts her eyes to him
more than anything else in the world
addison pats her shoulder lightly
then you must miss harrington how to get one
miss harrington knows all about it
phoebe smiles shyly
addison closes the door
phoebe stares down at the award for an instant
sleepy from the living room who was it
just a taxi driver miss harrington
you left the award in his cab and he brought it back
put it on one of the trunks will you
i want to pack it
sure miss harrington
she takes the award into the bedroom sets it on a trunk
as she starts out she sees eves fabulous wrap on the bed
then quietly she puts on the wrap and picks up the award
slowly she walks to a large three mirrored cheval
with grace and infinite dignity she holds the award to her and bows again and again
as if to the applause of a multitude
