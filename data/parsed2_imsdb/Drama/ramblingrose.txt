href b b rambling rose by calder willingham on a taxi arriving at the delta terminal of kennedy airport
a man in a well tailored gray suit gets out of the taxi
cut to a closer shot of the man as he pays the cabbie
he is willcox hillyer the middle aged buddy of this story and the observer through whose eyes it is seen
he has a dry ironic rather agreeable manner and he should seem like everyones idea of a successful author a slightly graying trim still youthful looking fifty
the camera follows him as he walks into the terminal carrying a small travel bag
cut to a shot of willcox hillyer at a counter getting his ticket processed
a little smile is on his face as he talks to a pretty airline girl
this character likes girls his aloofness is modified his face changes when he talks to them
the airline girl smiles back she finds him attractive
we dont hear what they are saying no dialogue on track it is obvious he is flirting with the girl in a mild way but now a frown comes on
his face and he turns his head as if slightly annoyed by something
cut to a pov shot of a tall gaunt almost totally bald man at the next ticket counter
the man is about sixty five and looks like a half senile great dane
he is dave wilkie erstwhile husband of the heroine of this story
age has not been at all kind to dave his face is lined with bitterness he is a sour angry lonely man and now he is making a very unpleasant
scene with a ticket girl and an airline representative waving his ticket and gesticulating angrily
he wears an expensive ill fitting suit and a texas type hat
we dont hear his angry complaints no dialogue is on the track
cut back to a close shot of willcox hillyer as he stares with a frown at the man
its as if he knows the man but cant place him
the airline ticket girl speaks to him and he turns back to her his face softening as he answers her obviously saying hell carry his bag
he nods goodbye to the girl turns and the camera follows him as he walks some distance away and stops looks back with another pensive frown at the tall gaunt
man at the next counter
cut to another pov shot of dave wilkie a longer shot than the first
the man is now arguing angrily with two airline representatives still waving his ticket and shaking his head
we dont hear him
lip readers might pick up what he is saying im supposed to be in first class not tourist
whats the matter with this friggin airline
cut back to willcox hillyer a close shot of his face as he rubs his chin and frowns obviously struggling to remember the man
the camera holds on him as he stares at the gaunt angry dave racking his brain
he shakes his head he cannot place the man and yet he knows him
the camera moves in closer on willcox hillyers face as he stares in pensive puzzlement at this ghost from the past and now we hear as if from a distance
faint music on the track it is dixie played with beautiful lazy mocking love by the great louis armstrong in his prime
at first we can barely hear it then the music becomes louder as hillyers frown deepens and he seems almost to know the man
the music remains a bit in the distance but it can be heard
other titles superimposed over the following action
various shots on willcox hillyer
he gives up his effort to recognize the strangely familiar dave with a little shrug turns and walks away with his travel bag
we see him entering the departure lounge and boarding the plane
a shot of him as he smiles rather nicely at a very attractive young stewardess as he walks down the aisle of the plane
he is not a crass or lewd flirt but life comes into his face when he sees a pretty girl he seems to have a real affection for girls toward
men he is polite but rather dry and ironic almost aloof but girls he likes
we see him sit in a seat open his travel bag and take out long galley sheets
he stares for a moment rather wearily at the galleys then sighs puts on reading glasses and begins to make corrections as boarding passengers walk by in the aisle
something or someone disturbs him he looks up with a slight frown and cut to a pov shot of dave wilkie all wonder and enthusiasm
this over the titles and we do not hear the dialogue they speak what we heard is louis armstrong but i will put the dialogue in here so the actors
can act it
we do not want to hear it the sense of what they are saying will be obvious from the acting
not on track buddd dee
my god if it aint buddy
well if this aint the darnest thing
another angle on them both as dave blocks the aisle an idiot false toothed grin on his face
hillyer has a pained embarrassed smile
not on track excuse me
your voice is familiar and im sure i know you from somewhere
not on track with delighted injury awww rr buddy come on you know me
not on track well i
ah h lets see
not on track its dave wilkie
im dave wilkie dont you remember me
not on track oh
of course dave how are you
the men shake hands dave enthusiastically hillyer less so
we see dave stow his suitcase and take the seat next to hillyer
cut to a shot of a big delta jet making its final taxiing turn and roaring into a take off
cut to a dramatic underbelly shot of the jet going up
a shot of the attractive young stewardess harried as she fixes drinks
cut to dave and willcox hillyer as the young stewardess gives them drinks
dave bestows a sour glance on her when he sees the single drink but at the moment he is in the midst of an aggressively self satisfied conversation and says
nothing to her
he speaks to hillyer who is making a real effort to be polite but is less than happy about the encounter
well i am in the construction business buddy and without braggin i have done real good at it
with a meaningful bitterness there are those who wouldnt have expected that out of me
pauses as if waiting for a reaction but hillyer is very silent right now im buildin a giant motel unit near alexandria outside washington d
not fi nance im on the construction side
making polite talk well thats interesting dave
i always liked washington its a pretty town
oh its all right beats jew york
but the niggers have took it over just like every other city we got only worse
hillyer gives a barely perceptible wince at this speech but dave doesnt notice he goes on with aggressive self satisfaction after a swallow of whiskey
but i have done real good in the construction field
what i dont know about buildin aint worth knowin
i knocked off twenty eight thousand smackeroos last year hows that for an old country boy
dave pauses realizes this might not impress glances down with curiosity at the galley sheets then an unpleasant smile
ha ha course you make a lot more
points at the galleys whats that you got there buddy
reluctantly galley proof
page proof of a book im working on
how about that
well you always were a screwball
lifts an eyebrow in mild irony oh yeah
unfazed i dont mean that the way it sounds
stares at galleys as if rattlesnake imagine it a book
and i used to know you personal way back when
pauses then earnestly tell me something buddy how do you dream up all that stuff
absolutely straight well actually we have a little black boy named her t who lives in the garage
he does it for me
for a moment half believes it then a slow stupid grin heh heh heh heh same old buddy always jokin around
almost as much of a joker as your daddy
drains his drink grimaces a heavy drinker dave i saw your daddy a coupla years ago i was up in glenville lookin at a motel site
i guess thats where youre headed huh to see him
stares out of plane window thats right dave im headed for glenville on a whisperin jet
suddenly calls out hey girl
hey you give us another drink
to hillyer sullenly dumb little bitch supposed to give us two in the first place
willcox hillyer listens with a pained half smile a hand at his temple
this friggin airlines out of its mind
a martyr the sons of bitches tried to put me in tourist
portentuously philosophical but our whole civilization is screwed up buddy
the heebies and the coconuts have took it over and ruined it
willcox hillyer half closes his eyes in weariness but says nothing
gently he rubs his temple
it is plain dave wilkie gives him a headache
another angle on the pretty young stewardess as she brings two more drinks
dave stares sourly at her wholly unmoved by her charm
took your time gettin here
she has other things to do dave
willcox smiles apologetically at girl
supposed to get two drinks in the first place
this friggin airline cant do nothin right
the stewardess purses her lips at dave who is bowed over his drink busy opening it
hillyer lifts an eyebrow at the girl as if to say dont blame me because of this damned idiot and she half smiles at him
obviously getting him off subject tell me about that job in alexandria dave the big motel youre building
with pedantic exactitude the man is a complete pain in the ass near alexandria
it isnt in alexandria it is outside it
thats correct outside it not in it
as for the job well the jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they aint worth a
sorry ass damn
takes big swallow of drink but i can build anything buddy
give me the plans and i can build a goddamn staircase to the moon
its a fact i can build anything
pauses then bitterly but she never believed that
oh hell no she never believed in me
this is another pointed bitter reference to the unknown she
once again willcox hillyer is deliberately unresponsive
um m well
broodingly doubted my ability all along the little bitch
i never remarried buddy you know that dont you
well no i didnt actually
shes te reason cured me of women once and for all
oh i got rid of her buddy i didnt waste no time kickin that bitch out
hell she was screwin everybody in savannah
i caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did i beat the everlastin piss out of him
dave wilkies eyes narrow with vindictive anger as he says it and one can well believe the streak of raw violence in the man
it is frightening even now he is a clown but he is a dangerous clown
as his long bitter impassioned tirade continues willcox hillyer becomes increasingly tense and pale it is obvious he detests what the man is saying and he is struggling to control
daves tone and voice are laconically southern but the hatred and misery in his eyes are raw
she didnt marry him though later she married another guy and went to winston salem
it didnt last that girl couldnt have no lastin marriage she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west
little bitch left him too and you know what shes married to right now
puts a big finger on hillyers chest a kike
thats right some kind of kike horse doctor named schapiro out in seattle whos got the nerve to have the same first name i got
wouldnt you know it rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike
she was always out of her friggin head and ill tell you why
his eyes narrow and again he puts a finger on hillyers chest buddy she was sick in her mind and between her legs too
she was a nymphomaniac
he has had enough with a pale trembling anger and in even tone dave you are as full of shit as a christmas turkey and you know it
now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail go right ahead
but i am telling you you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs
with surprising mildness a little smile almost as if he is pleased i dont want to start no fight with you buddy
why do you say im full of shit
dave schapiro is no horse doctor and rose has been a good wife to him for a long time
to call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing i ever heard in my life
again surprisingly mild you loved her didnt you
well so did i
a little shrug youll have to admit she had four husbands
yeah it took her a while to grow up and find mr
right but she did it
she found him
another little smile she used to call me mr
remember that buddy
he is pale with anger yeah i remember it
willcox picks up galley sheets half turns away
well i tell you i dont know what the worlds come to these days
things used to be better
we didnt have any money but things were better
grimaces in anger goddamn niggers and kikes burning the flag rioting raising hell they ought to shoot their asses off
i tell you buddy where this country made its mistake was allowing people without property to vote
during this speech willcox hillyer grits his teeth but says nothing
he keeps his eyes down on the galley sheets
as dave shakes his head in sorrow at the state of the nation
a shot of willcox hillyer at a hertz counter in the atlanta airport
a tense wrought up dave wilkie is in the b
of the shot
during the following brief exchange hillyer is politely cool wilkie under a great strain
holds out hand well got to get a plane to savannah
great running into you buddy
give my best to your daddy
yeah ill do that dave
sweating tense under some kind of awful emotional strain ah h if you happen to run into rose sometime
do me a favor give her a message for me will you
a trifle wearily dave i havent seen rose for years
hillyer takes rental car papers from a pretty young hertz girl gives the girl a little smile picks up his travel bag
in desperation dave takes his arm
buddy im a sick man
i had a heart attack last year i wasnt expected to live
hillyer turns to dave puzzled and interested dave earnestly explains
you might see her
she writes your daddy and she and that doctor came to see him didnt they
i wish youd tell her something
i never could write letters
in a different tone interested curious what do you want me to tell her dave
a painful inward struggle the man is tormented miserable oh to hell with it never mind
dont tell her anything
dont even tell her you saw me
half turns his back his face twisted with strong emotion got to run buddy ill miss my plane
willcox hillyer and the pretty young hertz girl stare after dave wilkie as he walks away with spasm like steps
hillyer seems affected less hostile toward dave now
he speaks half to himself half to the hertz girl
he still loves her
the poor damn fool still loves her
who was she
a girl named rose
pulls himself back into the world of reality still take r to glenville
willcox nods thanks and walks away carrying his travel bag
cut to a shot of the red ford driving from the airport
a shot of the red ford on interstate atlanta skyline in b
on the red ford as it speeds along a georgia interstate through red clay hills in green springtime
cut to a shot on willcox hillyer close on his face in the car
he is lost in reflection
a look of bitter sweet emotion is on his face an expression of sadness mixed with amusement
as the camera holds on his face we hear again on the track louis armstrongs great version of dixie or music of comparable power beauty and nostalgic evocation
now the music is stronger much stronger than behind the titles we are beginning to hear it full force
a shot of a thirteen year old boy on the front porch of a house in the sleepy depression south of many years ago
he is buddy willcox hillyer as a boy
the music continues as he shades his eyes to look at something far away
cut to a long pov shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl walking slowly up an oak shaded driveway
a zoomar lense takes us toward her
she is carrying a cardboard suitcase tied with a string
her clothes are cheap her shoes are dusty runs are in her stockings
she is sweaty tired and seems very nervous
rose is a very attractive girl but her primary quality is not sexiness but an innocence and sweetness
she pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she stares ahead uncertainly at the nice southern home which
to her seems very grand
it is apparent she is badly frightened and apprehensive about what lies ahead
she is also exhausted from the heat and a long hot walk in the southern sun
she blinks at perspiration swallows in anxiety again and forces herself to walk on
cut to a shot of buddy on the porch
expressionless unreadable neither friendly nor hostile he stares with an even gaze directly into the camera
he has his hands on his hips in a distinctive way that we will later see is a mannerism of his fathers
buddy tries to imitate the style of his father not always with complete success
unreadable as a sphinx he stands there waiting
cut to a pov shot of rose at the foot of the porch steps
a tentative little smile is on her face
it is very plain she is nervous and frightened
im rose and ive come to live with you and your family
the damn boy says nothing
a trifle crestfallen rose moistens his lips and swallows
she ventures another little smile and the camera follows her as she walks up the steps
the at times insufferable buddy comes into the shot
he still has his hands on his hips daddy style and his expression is inscrutable neither friendly nor hostile
whats your name
what do they call you
finally the boy speaks and he is not so bad
hes a child after all
lots of things
greatly reassured a real smile now buddy
well now thats a nice name i like it
i am real pleased to meet you
solemnly holds out her hand they shake hey look do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere
let me take your suitcase
a warm and beautiful smile comes on roses face and a little twinkle comes into her eyes
the innocence and sweetness are not lost that is never lost but this is a girl who likes boys and men
cut to a shot of buddys mother mrs
hillyer in a morris chair in her bedroom study
mother is a sensitive kind and rather appealing if slightly eccentric lady of about or
she wears glasses has a victorian hairdo and a ish style dress
at the moment mother is absorbed in her studies notebooks and history books are littered and piled everywhere around her chair
she is drinking a coca cola and smoking a cigarette held by a bobbie pin
calmly she glances up as buddy enters the room
the camera pulls back to include him
the new girl is here
whats she like brother
what is your impression of her
she talks a great deal and smiles a lot
shes very pretty she has a real good figure
shes very girlish or womanish if you know what i mean
she wouldnt hurt anybody this girl
mother accepts her sons precocious pronouncement as perfectly normal talks to him as if hes an adult
your impression is very reassuring brother
of course shes had troubles poor thing but i sensed that was that the girl was like and im glad to have it reconfirmed
you mean confirmed mother
i didnt confirm it before
i would have had to confirm it previously in order for it to be reconfirmed
all right all right
doll and waski are upstairs taking their nap you go get them and bring them down to the living room
where is the girl
in the kitchen drinking all the ice water in glenville
she walked out here she didnt go by the hotel
walked in all that heat
its a wonder she hasnt got sunstroke
ill phone daddy and you go get doll baby and waski
a shot of mother rose buddy doll and waski in the living room of the hillyer household
doll is a pretty little girl of about waski a boy of
mothers tone is very gentle very sweet very kind
her unabashed admiration for her own children has an ingenuousness that is more amusing than offensive
rose this is waski
his real name is warren but we call him waski
he doesnt like it much and i suppose someday well have to stop calling him that
you can stop it right now
when he was baby we called him wa wa a baby name you know
you will find him a very good boy
his brother can be bad and so can his sister but waski is a very good boy
and as you can see hes beautiful
oh mother cut it out
serenely there are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair
beauty is beauty and thats all there is to it
beauty is there and we have to recognize it
now rose the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is doll baby
she looks like an angel and she is an angel but she can be a naughty angel sometimes although her father wont believe it
her real name is frances but we call her dolly or doll
i dont like that either its worse than waski
i want to be called fran
daddy wouldnt hear that
now the redhaired boy you see sitting there of course you have met him he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child
all children have great creative powers but i dont want to rattle on about my children they say i brag too much about them especially about brother
am i boring you rose
rose has not as yet caught on to mothers style and is staring at her with lips apart and blue eyes slightly popped
feebly oh no maam
well its rather interesting about brother actually
i realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old
he looked at me and understood me he knew exactly who i was
i know it sounds crazy but its true
hes very remarkable he was born for the ministry and could move millions but he doesnt know that yet
i have to warn you about him he can be very dangerous there is an evil streak in him a streak of pure sheer meanness
but at heart brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesnt know it
slightly cuckoo a bit out of touch with reality but no fool
a very intelligent woman really and very very gentle and kind
her style however takes a little getting used to and her long speech throws rose completely
she stares at mother in speechless open mouthed awe unable to say a word
the camera moves in closer on rose as she moistens her lips swallows tries to talk and cant
she is very very nervous
now she flinches and looks around as we hear a deep masculine voice over the shot
it is the voice of daddy mr
hillyer buddys father
honey youll scare the gizzard out of the girl going into the fourth dimension like that
another angle on daddy in the doorway of the living room
he is a handsome man of about forty with a style and a manner all his own
as extravagant as his remarks often are and funny though he is at times the man has a courtly southern dignity that is never lost
he is no clown he is not even a comedian he is a man and a formidable man at that all the characters in this story love and fear him
we see now where buddy got his unreadable expression thing and his hands on the hips thing
daddy is unreadable
a straw hat is on the back of his head a rolled up glenville tribune is in his hand his hands are on his hips
he is staring with what seems to be stern fierceness at them all but his attitude really is inscrutable
it isnt the fourth dimension
to you its the fourth dimension maybe to me its simply the truth
staring fiercely at rose well well well
so miss rosebud has arrived
and youre all assembled here
daddy walks in as rose stares wide eyed at him
it is obvious he scares the absolute bejesus out of her she looks actually as if she might faint her hands trembling on her lap and her knees quivering beneath
her cheap and tacky dress
but she has a surprise coming
she is soon to lose all her fear of him every bit of it
daddy walks over and sits in a chair beside her stares fiercely at her for a moment then begins a long speech
again extravagant as this speech is he is no clown he is not being funny he means every word he says
well rosebud now you are here darling and i swear to god graceful as the capital letter s
you will adorn our house rosebud you will give a glow and a shine to these old walls
if theres one thing i like to have around its a frizzy haired blonde
now i assume mrs
hillyer and the children have introduced themselves and made your acquaintance and so forth and so on
rose can barely answer eyes fixed in rapt fascination on him a half whisper
now as head of this household i have a couple of remarks to make
it is my dear wifes belief which i accept although i do not totally grasp it that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice
therefore you are here not as a servant you are here as a friend as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family
you will eat your meals with us you will share life itself with us in love and harmony dear rosebud in love and harmony
do you understand me
a half whisper yes sir
daddy pauses then in a different tone his hidden gentleness and kindness are much more plain as he talks roses eyes begin to well with tears
now i know youve had some troubles in your life those
scoundrels in birmingham and so forth trying to
lead you astray
i hope you find a safe haven here honey i know youve had a hard time
life can be cruel to a young girl all alone
we welcome you to our home rosebud we all welcome you from the heart and hope you are happy here
rose bites her lip her eyes are filled with tears an inaudible whisper
various shots of rose doing household chores sweeping the floor vacuuming cooking
she is cheerful in her work smiling good humored and she works hard
it is obvious she is happy
we see the children in most of these shots
it is apparent rose is a very good worker and very happy in her new home
rose is washing the dishes while the children finish breakfast
buddy looks up from this cornflakes with a slightly sly expression
rose who were those scoundrels in birmingham
but who were they
they were just bad men thats all
in what sense were they bad
bad is bad buddy
there aint no sense to it
did they try to induce you to become a prostitute
rose turns around lifts her eyebrows tosses down the dishcloth
i dont answer talk like that buddy
i just dont hear it i turn my back and look away
rose turns her back on him
was that what they tried to do
was that why daddy gave you the job to save you from those scoundrels
your daddy is a wonderful man ill say that
hes the best and most kind hearted man in the world
hey rose did you hear about that terrible thing down in cave springs
what terrible thing in cave springs
there was this old man that ate his niece
rose stares emptily for a moment then bites her lips together
i didnt hear you
i didnt hear that
he really did he ate his little niece
he made pork chops out of her
i dont hear you
i just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away
well its only the truth
there are horrible things in the world rose
buddy you are in one of your evil moods i dont want to talk to you
im going out and sweep the patio
rose exits and the camera stays on buddy doll and waski
rose is almost as sentimental as mother
if theres one thing i cant stand its sentimentality
in chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder
he killed his wife with a black widow spider
oh shut up buddy
yeah shut up
cut to a shot of rose on the stone patio of the hillyer house an attractive area with outdoor furniture and crabapple tree limbs overhead
rose is busy sweeping
the camera pans to follow her and we pick up mrs
it is a nice day and she is studying out on the patio books and notebooks piled around
rose glances down curiously at her
what are you studying now mrs
more history rose
are you going to get your degree soon
well i am working on my thesis
as she busily sweeps it must be wonderful to be so smart
i dont see how you do it reading all those books learning all that stuff
looks up and gently rose you work too hard
why dont you go sit down somewhere and drink a co cola
smiles trusts and knows mother now not at all afraid of her youre so sweet
rose again busily sweeps
really why dont you go sit down somewhere
i like to work
i dont mind work
its the least i can do after all you and mr
hillyer have done for me
stares worshipfully at mother youre so sweet
there never was nobody like you
gently well you run on now
mother adjusts her notebook and turns the page of a history book as she resumes her studies
we hear the sound of an approaching car and she glances up
cut to a shot of a slightly worn out model a ford as it rolls up the driveway of the hillyer home daddy at the wheel
another angle on daddy as he gets out of the model a
he has his usual straw hat on the back of his head
the camera follows him as he walks onto the patio
good morning sweetheart
yes its so nice i thought id work outside
how goes it darlin
but at least i can concentrate now that rose is here
what do you think of her honey
mother doesnt answer she writes on head bowed over her notebook
we see in this shot the hearing aid she wears and hear from it a faint buzz
turn up your hearing aid
your hearing aid its buzzing at me like a snake
adjusts hearing aid oh
did you say something
i asked you what you think of rosebud now that shes been here a while
honey shes perfect
she works all the time and shes wonderful with the children
and they love her even brother likes her though he wont admit it
i think shes just perfect
almost too perfect
and shes such a good hearted thing there isnt an ounce of harm or malice in her
well ill admit i dont see any flies on her yet
there are no flies on rose i dont know what youre talking about
well she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in birmingham even if she did run away from them
cut to a shot of buddy in the window of the kitchen
he is propped on his elbows and listening with keen interest to the talk on the patio
we hear the voices of his parents over the shot
if you mean
boys and men i dont think so
rose seems very calm about all of that
well so far i have to agree
she seems calm as lettuce
the camera follows buddy as he draws back into the kitchen
we see doll and waski playing a game on the kitchen table
daddy says rose is calm as lettuce
do you believe that doll
neither do i
oh waski you dont even know what were talking about
i do too
buddy turns looks back out the window
cut to mother and daddy on the patio
daddy stands up
well lets hope for the best darlin
hope for the best
i dont understand all this skepticism
i thought you liked rose
i love rosebud i am wild about rosebud
i just hope she doesnt turn out to be a hidden hotcha character thats all
we have growing children in the house
if i had to live with your cynicism i wouldnt want to live at all
what you cant understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive not negative
gently his irony is mild all right darlin dont go off into the fourth dimension
im not in the fourth dimension points a finger at him you are in the fourth dimension when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control
as blake said if god had doubt the sun would go out
again gentle irony always courtly toward her forgive my crudity darlin
i dont understand these deeper things the way you do
reaches up takes his hand be nice to rose
shes never had a real home
youre a wonderful woman darlin
as long as youre around im sure the sun wouldnt dare go out
cut to a shot of buddy and doll and waski in the kitchen
doll and waski are playing parchesi on the kitchen table
buddy turns from eavesdropping at the window and strolls across the kitchen hands in his khaki pants
neither one of them know
as she shakes dice i think daddy suspects
no he doesnt
the camera follows buddy as he goes to the hall door carefully opens it to make no noise and peers down the hall
cut to a pov shot of rose busy dusting hall furniture humming as she works
we hear on the track the sound of the model a starting and rose freezes
then quickly rose hurries down the hall toward the front door
on buddy as he watches her through a crack in the door
he has his hands on his hips daddy style and his face is expressionless
another angle pov of buddy but closer on rose at the end of the hall
she is staring soulfully through the glass of the front door as we hear the model a go down the driveway
rose lifts a hand between her breasts sighs
a lovesick expression is on her face
on buddy as he comes back into the kitchen sadly shaking his head
its really pitiful
shes in bad shape
shes watching the car again
i get so irritated with daddy
hes so dumb sometimes
yeah i know
oh waski you dont know anything
i do too
all right what do you know
rose is madly in love with daddy
pauses then solemnly well dont tell mother
do you think im crazy
a shot of the family at dinner in the dining room at night
daddy is at the head of the table mother is at the other end
buddy doll and waski are all seated in neat nice clothes hands washed and hair combed
rose is serving but a place is set for her
she wears an attractive little apron and is smiling blushing happy as daddy teases and jokes at her
in a good humor rosebaby blossom these are the most delicious candied yams i ever ate
why they just melt in my mouth
and this fried chicken is fit for a king
how do you do it peachbird
what is the secret of your art plum blossom huh
blushing smiling oh i dont know i
rosebird baby you are the light of my life darlin
how did we ever get by without you
stares at him stricken i
ill get the grits
the camera follows rose as she exits and stops on buddy and doll
buddy slews his eyes toward his sister who meets his gaze for a moment then looks down at her plate
the camera moves on to mother who is utterly oblivious of anything going on between rose and daddy
rose does have a gift for cooking
she learns so fast but mainly i think its that she tries so hard
another angle on the family as they eat dinner
rose is seated at the table now
she is picking lifelessly at her food and glancing from time to time with a lovesick expression at daddy who is busy eating and seems wholly unaware of it
mother also is wholly unaware but all the children know what is happening
rose takes a gravy for a biscuit and spills a little her hand is trembling
gently suspects absolutely nothing rose youre in an awful dither tonight
whats the matter with you honey are you sick or something
in a feeble voice no maam im just fine
you look sick if you ask me
i hate to leave you with the dishes and all but im supposed to go to a meeting of the garden club this evening
to daddy ill need the car keys
ill drive you darlin
youve got no business behind the wheel of an automobile
you dont think about what youre doing and youll run into a telephone pole
i think about what im doing all the time and ive got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody
besides i want you to stay and help rose with the dishes the poor girl isnt feeling well
all right darlin
a shot of daddy alone in the dining room reading a newspaper and drinking coffee
rose comes into the picture gets dishes as she clears the table
she stares with a lovesick expression at daddy who is absorbed in paper
to himself mostly hmmp
did you realize there are a thousand coca cola millionaires in atlanta
cut to a shot of buddy and doll tiptoeing down the darkened hall toward the front door
we hear the model a going down the drive
they peer out of the glass of the front door
there goes mother
lets go peep from the living room
the camera follows them as they tiptoe into the darkened living room
they go over to the sliding doors and silently struggle for the best peeping spot
buddy gets up high doll down low at the crack in the doors through which light shines
cut to a pov shot of the dining room as seen by children
daddy sits absorbed in his paper oblivious of rose
she is staring down at him with a pale look of love
cut to a close up of buddy and doll their heads together
i think shes gonna kiss him
cut to a pov shot of daddy and rose as seen by children
the table now is cleared and rose stands half behind daddy staring down at him with a stricken expression
half to himself ehh lord should have bought that stock when we had some money
a thousand millionaires
rose suddenly makes up her mind places her hand on his shoulder turns sideways sits down on his lap puts an arm around his neck
hillyer i love you i love you so much
ive tried but i cant help it
please kiss me will you kiss me
for a long time daddy stares groggily at her with a half frown as if he cant believe it
in order to stare at her he must tilt his head back and handsome man though he is he looks a bit like a startled rooster
her breasts are pressed against him and her eager pink lips are waiting for a kiss
finally clears his throat ahh hem

rose breaks down and begins crying her head on his shoulder
she has her arms wound tight around him and daddy seems at a loss what to do
in a shaken voice all right all right
now calm down rose the children will hear you
calm down lets talk
about this thing lets discuss it
sobbing dont make me
calm down rose lets calm down and discuss it
cut to a shot of buddy and doll
doll is down near the floor and cant see as well

doll tries to rise up and buddy puts a hand on her head and shoves her down
this is my place and you cant have it
a whispered moan of frustration ohhh hh

his eyes open wide hes trying to get up good god one of her titties is out
let me see
cut to a pov shot of daddy and rose as he struggles to rise from the chair
they are half falling to the floor and now they fall rose still on his lap
one of her breasts has come out of her dress which is very loose and low cut
she has no bra the breast is bare
daddy is staring groggily at the breast as if slightly dazed
cut back to buddy and doll
buddy is frustrated now
now i cant see
what are they doing
happy peeping through crack boy
buddy groans and peers intently through crack
a pov shot of scene as observed by buddy
he is up too high the dining table blocks his view
we see the lower half of rose and daddy
roses skirt is up well above her knees
cut to a shot of buddy and doll
what are they doing
buddy this is amazing you wouldnt believe it

staring enthralled he kissed her
is that all
happily enjoying it he had his hand on her titty
let me look
cant stand it grabs her around waist and pulls her away eagerly looks sags aww rr
cut to a pov shot of the scene in the dining room
down low we can see under the dining room table now
daddy has his hands on roses shoulders and is firmly pushing her away
all right that is enough of this nonsense and i mean enough
get up off this floor rose and put your damned tit back in your dress
do you hear me girl get up off of that floor
rose on all fours blonde hair over her face making little whimpering noises of dismay ohh hhh
cut to buddy and doll
disappointed shes putting the titty back
a furious whisper buddy that was my place
doll forces her way in and they both peep through crack in door
cut to a pov shot of rose and daddy
rose stands sheepishly by the dining room table half crying as she adjusts her dress
daddy sits in his dining room chair
daddy is glaring at her
goddamn you girl
youve made me make a fool out of myself damn your hide but let me tell you i am standing at the pass of thermopylae and i wont budge
the very idea my own home with children in the house to say nothing of my wife oh h you had better believe i am standing at thermopylae you little
nut you had better believe it
what are you crazy
a man is supposed to be a fool like this but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense
are you a nitwit
whats the matter with you
weeping oh h im sorry
im sorry mr
couldnt help myself
cut to a shot of buddy and doll as they peep at the door
doll whispers angrily at him
buddy that was pretty snotty of you pushing me away like that just when it was interesting
you shouldnt watch such things doll
they continue to peep with interest through the crack in the doors
cut to a shot of rose and daddy
now rose is sitting penitent and crying in one of daddys handkerchiefs
daddys anger is gone he has gotten control of himself and speaks to her now in a different tone
he sits beside her an arm around her shoulders in a fatherly way
rose rose rose you poor miserable little child dont you know i love you
do i have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it
you are beautiful to me rose ive loved you since you first came here darlin
and dont you know mrs
hillyer loves you too that shes already taken you into her heart and that that womans heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the
weeping in handkerchief oh i know
shes so sweet shes been so good to me
do you know what a friend you have got there
do you know she would fight for you like a tiger that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone
tried to hurt you
is this any way to repay her trust and love
are you ashamed as i am ashamed
pauses as rose sobs in handkerchief dont cry honey dont cry
but let me warn you damn your hide this is thermopylae and i am standing here
do you hear me damn you
i am standing at thermopylae and the persians shall not pass
now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes and stop crying
cut to buddy and doll in the darkened living room
he gestures that theyd better leave and they do
the camera follows them as they tiptoe out of the living room
another angle on buddy and doll as they tiptoe up the front stairs
on buddy and doll at the top of the stairs
they pause to talk and now they dont have to whisper
doll is happy pleased
wasnt daddy wonderful
he wanted to kiss her some more and play with her but he didnt because he loves mother and all of us and he loves rose too
isnt he wonderful isnt he great
dryly aloof he doesnt mean this really wonderful
he kissed her and played with her titty and i dont see anything so great about that
he was probably afraid mother would come back early and catch him
you know buddy sometimes you make me sick
doll gives him a venomous glance and walks away
the camera stays on buddy as he stares after her with a thin little smile
be seems wryly amused that he has made her angry
after a moment he turns and stares in the direction of downstairs and his face changes
his smile fades then slowly returns as he thinks of what has happened
quietly to himself thermopylae
the persians shall not pass
it is obvious that secretly buddy admires very much his fathers behavior
a shot of buddy at night in his small bedroom
he wears a rather skimpy old fashioned nightshirt that comes midway between his hips and knees
at the moment he is finishing brushing his teeth at the bureau using an old fashioned water pitcher and bowl
the camera follows as he walks across the room in the light of the lamp by his bed
he looks around cautiously then picks up the mattress of his bed
he pushes it far back and we see springs
he takes out a small book or pamphlet and stares gravely at it
close up the front cover of the pamphlet
we see the overall title little dirty comic books
and beneath it blondie and dagwood
and beneath that in smaller letters mr
dithers comes to dinner and how
we see buddys hands in the shot and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a glimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful a drawing
maybe of blondie stark naked with a finger in her mouth going tee hee
on buddy as he stares down with grave intentness at the little dirty comic book
slyly now he retraces his steps to the bureau and takes out a flashlight
he goes back to the bed switches off the lamp gets in the bed and turns on the flashlight and pulls the covers over his head
we hear a faint sound on the track and buddy suddenly yanks back the covers puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and throws the little dirty comic
book under the bed
he lies on pillow and pretends hes asleep and we hear the door of his room open and a creaking on the floor
another angle on a weepy rose in a very thin nightgown
the shot is from below as buddy might see her as she stands over his bed
she looks very lonely and unhappy and is half crying
are you asleep
another angle on both of them
buddy stares at her in surprise
it is dim in the room but we can see them in the moonlight
no im awake
whats the matter
buddy i am wandering in a wilderness lost
sits glumly on edge of bed i just feel awful
do you mind if i get in bed with you for a little while
well all right
another angle on rose and buddy in the bed in the moonlight
it is all innocent enough buddy is a child and rose obviously has no lewd intent in getting into his bed
she lies back on a pillow staring up at the ceiling and smoking a cigarette
i thought id go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to
as a child i never had no room all to myself we were awful poor
i have got a confession to make
what is it rose
its so terrible i cant tell you
oh buddy you dont know how it hurts to have a broken heart what a terrible feeling it is and ive had a broken heart so many times
men i dont understand them i cant figure them out and they break my heart thats all
i cant find mr
right buddy i cant find him no matter how hard i look all i find is a whole pile of mr
but this is the worst ever because it wasnt his fault
it was my fault oh yes my fault i was bad oh god i was bad you wouldnt believe how bad i was
a little smile whatd you do rose
buddy i was horrible
i cant tell you who it was but do you know what i did
i sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worsen you could know a child like you
why i let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and i let my dern skirt come up so
he could see my drawers
pauses realizes this isnt too dignified but to get back serious to what i was sayin it is not only buddy the loss of him but my own bad behavior
what bothers me so
you were pretty bad huh
why it has just made me ill buddy
i dont want to eat nothin i dont and me i got a good appetite that aint natral for me
slyly pretends he doesnt know but rose what is the cause of it all
promise not to tell doll
buddy its your daddy
im so much in love with him i am out of my mind
but rose how could such a thing as that happen
i fell madly in love with him when he called me rosebud
you know that first day when i come and he said i looked graceful like a capital letter s and called me rosebud
i fell madly in love with that man right then
sighs tragically but its a lost love buddy
hes a good man and wont have nothin to do with me
another angle on rose and buddy in the bed
buddy has propped on an elbow and is staring down at her breasts in the moonlight we see the soft notch between her breasts in the open v of her
she is completely unself conscious with him
casually can i touch you here
before she can answer he touches her breast with his finger through her nightgown
hmmm its soft
its awful soft
casually doesnt object what did you expect
well i thought they were more like a cantaloupe
ha ha ha thats some idea a cantaloupe
touches her breast more boldly his hand outside the nightgown theres some kind of gristle in it though
buddy quit that youre just a child youre not supposed to be interested in such things
actually i am though
dreamily thinking of daddy as she smokes cigarette and stares up at the ceiling you know that daddy of yours is the funniest man the things he says you never
know whats going to come out of his mouth next
can i put my hand inside your nightgown rose
no you cant
and ill tell you this he scares me
as kind as he is he scares me
you cant fool around with him not with that man
and boy i sure better not try nothin like that with him again hell fire me
rose cant i see what the nipple on it is like
frowns buddy whats come over you
a child like you askin such things
but im curious rose
puts his hand in her nightgown
buddy get your hand offa me
quit it get you hand away
takes his wrist
just for a second
please rose whats the harm
gently buddy you dont realize it but what youre doing isnt nice
aw come on rose i want to see what the nipple on it is like
you don t need to know that
its none of your business
aw be a good sport rose
sweetly almost sugarily you like me dont you
i like you a lot
cut to a shot of mothers bedroom study in the moonlight
we see daddy lying wide awake in a single bed staring broodingly out into space
mother lies asleep in a big four poster in the background of the shot
daddy sighs wearily to himself in the grip of insomnia in reverse
cut back to buddy and rose in bed
he has evidently sweet talked her into letting him fiddle with her his hand is in her nightgown
there is no indication of lewd interest on roses part a peeved and exasperated look is on her face
buddy seems quite fascinated however
well are you satisfied now
can we just lie and talk huh
it has a nipple all right
course it does
first i couldnt feel it but now i feel it easily its like a little acorn
moistens her lips swallows it is affecting her she frowns all right thats enough
firmly pushes his hand away youre just a child and wouldnt understand it but that type of thing can stir a girl up
now lie back and well talk
that was very interesting
thank you rose
lighting cigarette dont mention it
pensively with the solemn pedanticness of a precocious child it was softern i thought that was my main impression
you know if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot
who would want to do such a thing as that
well some fiend might
stares wonderingly at him you know buddy sometimes i cant figure you out at all
you can be very nice but like your mother said theres an evil streak in you
theres an evil streak in everybody rose
there aint none in your daddy
you know what happened has just made me love him all the more
i not only love him i respect him i admire him
rose i have a serious favor to ask you
most men wouldnt do what he done
if they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her i guess to hell they do just like a dern rabbit
course later theyll tell her shes no good when they done the same thing their selves
theyre a bunch of monkeys
i like em but theyre a bunch of monkeys
trying to be casual rose since youre here in bed with me and everything and ive already touched your titty
cant quite say it leans over and whispers in her ear and we dont hear what he says
her eyes open wide as he whispers why buddy shut your mouth
what an awful thing to say and where did you get any such idea as that anyhow
im curious to see what its like
im very curious rose
well now that is just too bad
curiosity killed the cat
yeah but satisfaction brought him back
you ought to be ashamed of yourself astin such a nasty things a child your age
cant i touch it a little rose not a lot just a little
of course you cant
im shocked at you buddy real shocked
now you be quiet or im going back to my own bed
im curious thats all i have a natural curiosity its only human
youre my friend arent you
dont you like me
again sweetly almost sugarily i like you rose a lot in fact i love you
softens despite herself well youre sweet but you dont really love me
yes i do
please rose be a good sport
buddy youre just a child
and i have a natural curiosity
its only nature rose thats all
now whats wrong with nature huh
cut to a shot of daddy sitting on the edge of his bed in pajamas
he looks frowzle haired and glum
the camera follows him as he wearily gets up and walks across the bedroom in the moonlight and takes a package of cigarettes from a bureau
be glances over his shoulder as we hear mother
whats the matter hon
is anything wrong
just that damnable insomnia in reverse
i sleep like a baby for an hour then im wide awake
you go back to sleep
daddy lights a cigarette and walks to the window and stares out at the moonlit night
the camera moves in closer on his face and we see a weariness and strain he has not shown before
the depression has got me
that miserable hotel no money anywhere strong men out of work children hungry
its a great life if you dont weaken
a shot close on rose and buddy in bed
evidently rose has weakened and is allowing him to fiddle with her but we can only surmise this the shot is on their heads and shoulders and a cloud has
crossed the moon the light is more dim
a different look is on her face a solemn expression as if she is listening to some far away sound that she finds strangely haunting
she moistens her lips speaks in a slightly feeble voice
you better quit that
i must be outta my mind
buddy quit it
am i hurting you
pauses stares off as if listening then in an even feebler tone a half whisper no
no youre not hurting me
moistens her lips swallows but i think you better quit it
but why if im not hurting you
you wouldnt understand
puts a hand on his shoulder as if to push him away but cant puts her other hand over her eyes oh god i must be outta my mind
what would your momma think
the hand falls limply from roses eyes and she turns her head to the side and closes her eyes
helplessly she lies there as the boy fiddles with her
cut to a shot of daddy walking down the downstairs hall in a bathrobe and slippers
he looks very frowzled and sleepy
on daddy as he walks into the kitchen turns on the light
he goes to the ice box an old fashioned type made of wood that takes cakes of ice
be pours out a glass of milk
cut to a very close shot on roses face
the light is dim but we see perspiration on her forehead
her breathing is not normal
her eyes are shut tight her teeth are clenched
cut to a shot close on buddy
we do not see what he is doing but evidently he is fiddling with her
he seems quite interested in the proceedings
rose beyond a doubt this is the most fascinating experience of my life
cut to a shot of daddy in the kitchen as he sits rather gloomily at the kitchen table drinking the glass of milk
to himself ehh hh lord man born of woman hath few days and they are full of trouble
cut to a shot close on rose ai buddy in the bed
the shot is of their heads and shoulders
she has an arm very tight around his shoulders and her eyes are shut tight
the moment of truth is at hand
its all over she twists sideways puts both arms around him oh buddy youre so sweet
i love you a lot
cut to a shot of daddy as he washes out the glass in the sink
cut to a shot of rose and buddy in the bed
the extremity of her crime has dawned on rose and she is sitting up in the bed with a look of horror on her face
buddy is staring worriedly at her
rose are you all right
are you sick or something
staring off in space lost in horror no
no im all right
turns stares at him puts a hand in woe on her forehead oh god what have i done
i have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell
fumbles desperately on bed for cigarettes i must be crazy a child like you
oh god oh lord
this is awful this is terrible i gotta get outta here
another angle on rose and buddy as rose in a panic gets out of the bed pulls down her thin nightgown and tiptoes toward the door
she stops and looks back as a chilling thought occurs to her
buddy you wouldnt tell nobody would you
a trifle too piously dont worry rose i wont tell a soul
i sure hope you dont
still in a panic i gotta get outta here good night
sweetly good night rose
cut to a shot of daddy walking down the downstairs hall in his bathrobe
the shot is down the staircase and rose in the upstairs hall tiptoes into the picture
a floorboard creaks and he looks up and sees her
rose what are you doing up
nothin just goin to the bathroom
is anything wrong
well good night
another angle on rose in the upstairs hall
fortunately for her the light is dim
her knees are shaking beneath the nightgown she looks as if she might faint
the camera follows her as she goes on shaky legs down the hall
cut to a shot of rose as she enters her small bedroom
feebly as if totally exhausted she shuts the door behind her then leans against a bureau and states into its mirror
the horror of her own criminality has overwhelmed her
with trembling hands she takes a cigarette from her half empty pack and finds a wooden kitchen match on the bureau
her hands tremble visibly as she strikes the match
she has not turned on the light in her room and her considerable charms are very apparent in the orange glow of the match
burning match in her fingers she stares at her own reflection in the bureau mirror transfixed by a horrible realization
quick dissolve to blurred screen the border of the screen is blurred we are obviously seeing a nightmare fantasy
the shot is of an eager excited diabolically mischievous buddy and an astonished awed doll
they are in some far dark recess of the cellar of the house and the scene is furtive murky cobwebby
wait till you hear what happened
now you wont believe this doll but rose came in my room and got in my bed last night
another angle on buddy from below with candlelight giving his childs face a sinister look
now he has dracula teeth and evil arched eyebrows
and she sweated and snorted like a horse and had a horrible fit her eyebrows were all scrunched up and she groaned like she was eying and foamed at the
cut to a shot of rose standing horrified before the mirror
the match is still burning in her fingers
a shot of mother in her study a worried doll stands before her
the border of the screen is blurred it is another flash of fantasy
yes dear what is it
mother buddy says rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit and he says i would too if i
was grown up
is it true mother would i sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says
mother stares in consternation at doll
a shot of daddy and rose on the front porch of the house
the scene is murky dark gloomy night and the weather is bad
daddy has his arm rigidly thrust outward as he points down the driveway
a weeping slumped rose sadly walks down the steps carrying her cardboard suitcase
out you viper in the grass
never darken our doorstep you immoral terrible girl
cut back to rose standing before the mirror sick with horror
a feeble whimper like groan comes from her
ohh hh ohhh hh
match burns her fingers she shakes it out ouch
another angle on rose as she turns from the bureau and stares off into space a very badly frightened girl
half crying she speaks to herself
hell tell em for sure he will
oh lord what can i do
cut to a shot of buddy half asleep in bed
the light of the lamp by his bed goes on and he sleepily opens his eyes
the camera comes back and we see rose in her nightgown standing by his bedside
she is very pale and tears are on her cheeks
i hate to turn on this light you daddys awake downstairs but i have to take the chance
sits by him on bed buddy please dont tell on me
rather coolly i said i wouldnt
her lip trembles buddy i have to ask you as bad as ive been please have pity on me and dont ruin me by telling them what i did
i know it was bad it was bad and dumb
but mostly it was dumb i didnt mean you no harm id never want to hurt a hair on your head and thats the truth
i love you
but theyd think i did theyd think i was awful theyd despise me and hate me
rose bows her head and begins crying into her hands
cut to a close shot of buddy
we hear the soft sound of rose weeping over the shot
buddy is affected his flinty childs heart has been touched but he is not quite ready to admit it yet
he is struggling with himself trying to remain cool and not show his emotion
he frowns moistens his lips swallows
with seeming coolness very much as in the scene with doll in which he deprecated daddys stand at thermopylae he shrugs
well i dont know what youre worried about
it was my idea i was the one who thought of it not you
the camera pulls back to include rose
she is staring at the boy with hopeless despair
you dont understand
theyd blame me not you
and theyd think i was awful a disgustin girl which i am but buddy please dont tell them
ill have to go and i love it here i love your whole famly your daddy your mother
pauses then makes her final and ultimate plea in a shaking voice as tears run down buddy i know im no good im a bad girl but i cant help
it please have pity on me and dont tell
please dont please
too much for buddy he loses his cool
he swallows and blinks as if he might cry then sits erect in the bed and squares his shoulders and assumes a stern expression daddy style
very solemnly rose they could stick splinters under my fingernails and i will never say a word
i will never tell them because
i love you
sees that he means it smiles in relief and throws her arms around him oh buddy you do love me
i knew you did knew it all the time
cut to a shot of daddy lying in bed and staring up sleeplessly at the ceiling
insomnia in reverse has got him
a half whisper to himself ehh hh lord
great life if you dont weaken
cut to a shot of rose and buddy
rose is sitting on the bed beside him and she has dried her tears and got herself in hand
well ill tell you this
i have learned a lesson tonight
i wasnt gonna run around but when i start botherin your daddy and worse robbin a cradle i gotta face the facts of life
pauses then with firm resolution tomorrow mornin im gonna get myself up and go out
a wee mite puzzled youre going to get yourself up and go out
right is out there somewhere and im gonna find him
a shot of a coolly angry mother in the kitchen
it is late morning
as she talks the camera pulls back to show a sheepish buddy standing on the carpet before her
the other children doll and waski are seated at the kitchen table having hamburgers for lunch
they are happily smiling with schadenfreude amusement at their brothers discomfiture
brother when i have to wake you up at eleven oclock in the morning youre either sick or you were up very late last night
points a finger at him and you werent reading huckleberry finn
i looked and its not in your room
now what were you doing
sheepish mother i have to tell the truth
i wasnt reading huckleberry finn i was reading one of those little dirty comic books
sadly oh brother i am so disappointed in you
you mustnt look at those horrible things they degrade the human image
hangs head theyre filthy mother
sex isnt ugly sex is one of the most beautiful things in life the creative power of the universe is behind it
i know mother
but we must respect that power we must be in awe of it
i am in awe of it mother
i dont think you are sufficiently in awe of it
get the castor oil
winces as doll and waski happily smile oh mother not the castor oil
this isnt punishment i dont believe in punishment
its for your health
obviously youre sick if you can act like that
as she talks buddy reluctantly gets a bottle of castor oil and a tablespoon from a shelf and brings it to her
a smiling doll comes forward and hands buddy half of an orange
he makes a face at her
mother takes the bottle and pours out a tablespoon of castor oil
wanly mother cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil
this is for your own good
when you look at negative destructive things like those little filthy comic books you are sick

he is resigned theres no way out he makes a face swallows the castor oil geccch yehh guhhhh

wheres rose anyhow
shes getting herself up to go out
frowns adjusts hearing aid whatd you say brother
shes getting herself up to go out
i think shes coming down the hall now
oh yes its thursday
glances around at sound of an opening door hello rose dear
her eyes open wide as she stares at rose disconcerted now weakly my youre
cut to a shot of rose in the doorway of the kitchen
she is quite an apparition
she wears bright red lipstick pink rouge on her cheeks mascara and her hair is coiffed up in some outlandish manner but her clothes are the most remarkable thing of
the skirt is of strange pink semi shiny and very thin material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could be rosebuds sewed on it
it fits extremely snugly to say the least
the blouse seems a composite it has frilly white sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white material that is hardly opaque at all
she has no bra and her breasts are half visible the nipples denting the material
it is pretty wild for
she seems to have on no underwear of any kind the skirt which clings to her like a bathing suit shows no panty seams
she is carrying a shiny black patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent leather shoes and no stockings
an ingenuous little smile is on her face
how do you like my outfit
i made most of it myself
rose walks in modeling the outfit and the camera picks up mother
smiling slightly aghast well its
we hear the sound of the model a on the driveway
here comes daddy
staring down admiringly at the outfit i have a knack for designing clothes
but i had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook
makes up her mind to defend rose well i think its charming rose
tactfully but dont you think
ah the skirt is a little tight
oh no thats the style
its meant to be clinging
we hear the porch door slam
smiling happy rose glances around
we hear the sound of the kitchen door opening
cut to a pov shot of daddy in the kitchen doorway
as usual he has a rolled up glenville tribune in his hand and a straw hat on the back of his head
his hands are on his hips and he is hunched forward as if he cannot believe what he sees
ye gods and little fishes
what have you done to yourself rose
on them all
rose is smiling happy to be the center of attention
i got myself up thats all
got yourself up

daddy walks slowly into the kitchen shaking his head
sits at table
well that is the damndest outfit i ever saw in my life
you walk down the street like that and theyll put you in jail rose
why they wont either
she looks pretty
and i wish you wouldnt pick on the poor girl all the time
dont listen to him rose you look pretty even beautiful
smiles affectionately at mother youre so sweet
if youve got time before you go out get me a half a cup of coffee rose
not a whole cup a half a cup

a growl doesnt like jokes about his foibles um hmmuhh
i never drink a whole cup my nerves cant stand the caffeine
ehh hh lord awful insomnia in reverse last night

sweetly daddy buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books

heres your half a cup of coffee
daddy is staring with a very dubious frown at roses skirt
he slowly shakes his head
thats a pretty stylish skirt rose
the only thing i dont understand is how did you ever get it on
happy pleased by his interest well it has buttons
points to little buttons on right side of the skirt
how can the buttons stand the pressure
there are more on the other side
points to buttons on left side
turn around darlin
happy to oblige rose turns around
her plump round feminine behind is only too plainly revealed through the thin material
daddy slowly shakes his head
theyll put her in jail
the damn little fool might as well be naked
a wee mite worried well it is a little tight
but it isnt as bad as all that
no one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place
who doesnt have such thoughts
glances at wristwatch wed better get going
youre not having lunch
just half a cup of coffee
i never eat darlin you know that
not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses
lets go rose you and brother lets hit the road
rose you and brother wait in the car

another angle on rose and buddy as rose picks a red rose and puts it in her hair
did your momma really give you castor oil
puts an arm around his shoulders youre my sweetheart
cut to mother and daddy at the kitchen table
earnestly i wish you wouldnt pick on rose and tease her like that
of course her clothes are silly but shes ignorant naive she doesnt know any better
the girl worries me
if she walks down the street like that an army will be following her
well i admit that outfit isnt very modest
but she doesnt mean any harm she just wants to attract attention
she will succeed
i dont think you understand her
it isnt sex she wants its love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it
musingly that farmer in gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her and im beginning to see why
he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children
well she loves children all right
adds dryly she loves everybody
but thats a wonderful quality not a bad quality
takes his hand have a little patience with her
shes such a good hearted little thing and tries so hard
stares pensively at her you are the one whos good hearted
rises as for rose lets hope for the best
rises again takes his hand be kind to her
she loves you so much
daddy stiffens slightly and she adds in a perfectly proper way of course
yes of course
cut to a shot of rose and buddy waiting in a model a

hawkshaw the detective is on the scent
daddy stares ahead

daddy sternly scans them both
they stare back innocently at him
finally he seems to accept it
i cant imagine why
it was just a thought

they might arrest her
i doubt it but they might
cut to a shot of rose as she walks up to a bus stop
a fairly well dressed man with a door to door salesman kit is standing there

rose smiles wanly
i dont know him
a shot of mrs
hillyer in her bedroom study

that sulky boy was here again this afternoon

first a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away
this is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show
i swear to god i dont know who in the world he is
really i dont i dont know no boy like that i dont
slowly his face grim daddy returns his napkin to his lap and resumes eating
the children are very silent and look a trifle scared
finally in a small voice well it isnt roses fault boys and men like her
you cant blame her for that hon
rose i realize you dont know this boy but if you know anybody who does know him if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be
then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife
and i dont mean maybe
cut to a shot of buddy in his room at night
he is dressed and at a study table listening with cheap earphones to a homemade crystal radio set
enter a rather somber faced doll in her nightgown
i had st
buddy im worried about rose
so am i
she hasnt got any sense
in some ways shes awful dumb
takes off earphones gives it a moment of grave consideration then his opinion it isnt that she hasnt got any sense doll
her basic intelligence is probably above average maybe quite a bit above average
then why does she act so dumb
dumbness doesnt concern her doll
and neither does smartness
you see buddy is interrupted by the sound of the distant angry shout of a mans voice evidently from somewhere outside in the woods because buddy and doll turn at
once toward the window
in shock they listen
you son of a bitch what are you doing here
id like to ask you the same question you bastard
i told you to stay away from her goddamn you
you got no right to tell me to stay away from her i knew her before you did
oh boy oh boy
daddy isnt going to like this
she told you to leave her alone didnt she
like hell she did
youre the one she wants to get shed of
he and doll hurry from the room
cut to a shot of buddy and doll running down the upstairs hall and down the stairs
the cam m follows them down the stairs
cut to a shot of buddy and doll as they slow down and creep cautiously down the back hall to the back porch
we hear the men yelling somewhere out in the dark bushes
youll swallow teeth yourself if you dont leave her alone you ugly bastard
go on throw one throw one
ill throw one you son of a bitch
we hear a great crashing in the bushes a smack of a fist a groan of shock an oath a shout more crashing
cut to a shot from the pov of the children on daddy on the back porch as the lights blaze on
he wears his bathrobe and has a big shotgun in his hands
now he speaks in a loud clear and very angry voice
all right i have got a parker shotgun here and it is loaded and the trigger is cocked and wherever you birds are and whatever you are doing you had
better get the hell out of here goddamned quick
a sudden total silence ensues then a sudden crashing in the bushes as the birds take off
and do not come back you sons of bitches
stay away from my house and home and my wife and children or ill blow your goddamned heads off
cut to a shot of buddy and doll as they cower in awe in the downstairs hall
daddy walks up to them carrying the shotgun
he is grim and furious but his voice is surprisingly calm
you children go to bed
and brother stay away from rose ill speak to her in the morning
cut to a shot of buddy and doll in the upstairs hall
doll meekly goes to her room
buddy hesitates looks at roses door glances nervously back at the stairs then goes to roses door knocks softly opens it
cut to a shot of buddy and rose as he stands in the doorway of her room
rose is sitting on the edge of her bed in her nightgown a damp cloth held against her jaw which seems a little swollen
a look of fear and guilt is on her face
rather feebly as if it explains something i got an awful toothache
quietly rose if you dont keep your boyfriends away from the house daddy is going to fire you
innocently but i dont know who they are
buddy makes an exasperated grimace and exits shutting door
the camera remains on rose as she rolls her eyes upward in dismay
a shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room
the silence is deafening
everyone looks depressed except daddy who is aloofly calm
roses head is bowed meekly over her plate as we hear the clatter of silverware
finally daddy speaks in an almost pleasant tone
well rose my sleep was a little disturbed last night and so was mrs
hillyers and so was the childrens
how about you
was your sleep disturbed too
solemnly yes mr
hillyer it was
i heard strange voices in the night
softly strumming fingers finally strange voices rose
innocent as an angel yes sir
still aloofly polite now rose stop behaving as if youre bo peep
those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house and it wasnt dolly or mrs
very tense i dont think we ought to discuss this in front of the children
weeping a hand over her eyes oh
one of em
but i dont hardly know him
oh shut up rose
shut your mouth and quit crying
draws herself up i will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl
i am not being brutal to her
you certainly are
she has an awful toothache look at her jaw its all swollen
trying to restrain himself aloofly polite to the utmost darlin it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics the word means an animal epidemic and its a pet
word of daddys he pronounces it epi zoo tics not epi zoo ot tics and uses it to mean any outrageous human malady i am not responsible for her epizootics and i did not bring about her epizootics
now listen to me
when i have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes scoundrels
they werent scoundrels they were just boys
you say to me boys
yes i say that to you they were boys
boy friends of rose chats what they were and why shouldnt she have boy friends
do you want her to be unnatural
dont you think shes human the same way you are yourself
its the south thats what it is the south with its horrible traditions of slavery and crime and the oppression of women who are just as good as men and
just as human
his eyes are a trifle glazed now darlin what has the south got to do with this
in a real snit afraid he will fire rose and when i try to talk to you seriously when i try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of
life how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts what do you do you mock me
mildly his eyes are even more glazed i dont intend to mock you dear
i respect your philosophy
its beyond my comprehension but i respect it
head bowed weeping in a little handkerchief ohhh hh ohhh
exasperated oh shut up rose eat your cornflakes
piteously im not hungry
the word is hongry not hungry
now you listen to me rose with fire in her eyes just a moment
you are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends not while there is breath in my body
i dont intend to fire her darlin
it isnt her fault if shes popular
i said i dont intend to fire her
i just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth thats all
simmers down at once now calmly well thats very reasonable
howe i hate to bring it up but shes got an awful toothache weve got to carry her to the dentist
i dont want to go to the dentist
be quiet rose
darlin ill take a taxi to the hotel
you and brother can handle the girls epizootics
ill just say one more thing
turns to rose and in a grave tone rose i told you you had a friend in mrs
hillyer didnt i that she would fight for you like a tiger
meekly yes sir
all right thanks to her and thanks to this case of epizootics you are getting another chance
points a finger at her and sternly but dont try my patience again
we have growing children in this house
do you understand me
cut to a shot of mother rose and buddy in a dentists waiting room
rose is holding a rubber ice bag to her jaw which is quite swollen
she is groaning and half weeping in pain
does the ice help rose
ohh hh a little
oh h i aint never been to no dentist before
hes gonna kill me i just know it
no rose hell help you
another angle rose shrinks in fear as enter the dentist in a white coat dr
winton a kindly looking gray haired man
we see a nurse behind him
he smiles in a reassuring manner
nurse says we have a nervous patient
now young lady be calm
first of all let me tell you i am not going to hurt you

rises takes her by the hand now come on rose

another angle on rose and mother and dr
winton as they guide and lead rose into the dentists operating room
she plants her feet and her eyes open wide with horror as she sees the chair and other equipment
im not goin in there i dont like the looks of it
annoyed rose sit down in that chair and be quiet
were trying to help you you silly creature sit in that chair
very reluctantly sits in chair oh hh ohh hh lord hes gonna kill me
you and the boy wait outside
cut to a shot of mother and buddy in the waiting room
winton with a little frown
well she finally let me look in her mouth
is it true shes never been to a dentist
she was raised on a poor dirt farm
im sure shes never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor
well she has one mouth in ten thousand i dont see teeth like that once in ten years
her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth but there isnt a cavity in her head not a single one
she has perfect teeth
but the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled
yes and its very bad
it probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia
that would scare her to death
shes terrified of hospitals
to her a hospital is where you go to die
i think youre right it would be harder on her
but youd better call mr
hillyer shes going to need help to get home
a shot of daddy behind the wheel of the model a
rose lies pale and exhausted on mothers shoulder on the front seat
a trace of bloody gauze can be seen in her mouth and her eyes are closed

no more dentists no more dentists

daddy straightens up sets his jaw leans the cue against the table and marches toward the elevator as buddy stares after him
the camera stays on buddy
cut to a shot of buddy going down the hotel stairs
he holds onto the banister sliding with his hands far ahead in order to take four and even five steps at a time it is a childish trick the point
of the game is to touch as few stairs as possible

daddy comes from behind the desk grim
rose is in jail

his hands are on his hips his straw hat is on the back of his head and a bit to one side
buddy stands beside him a little bit behind a worried look on his face
the chief of police a fat man is on the other side of daddy
cut to a pov shot of rose in the cell
her hair is mussed her dress is torn
a little innocent frightened smile is on her face
the camera pans to include daddy and the chief of police
that was a awful brawl down at the busy beaver mr

son of a bitch is right he dern near killed a man
and this girl was the cause of it all

nods slowly then with aloof politeness thats all youve got to say youve got a bad cold
coughs again well i dont know what happened
they were arguin about baseball then all of em started fightin
as for that policeman i didnt bite him i dont think i bit him
in dour silence daddy and the chief of police stare at rose
she gives them a little smile as if to say see how innocent i am
the chief turns to daddy and asks with dry irony well shes your girl mr
you want me to release her in your custody
no not really
but i guess well have to do that john
let her out
let the crazy creature out and ill take her home
cut to a shot of daddy rose and buddy in the model a
daddy stares grimly ahead silent
buddy looks solemn
rose is badly frightened and still coughing
finally she ventures a little smile and speaks to daddy
i got an awful cold i think im sick
daddy is silent his eyes fixed ahead
cut to a shot of the model a as it turns onto the hillyer driveway
cut to a shot of daddy rose and buddy in the car
she tries again

cut to a shot of a shaky slumped rose going up the steps with buddy as the model a drives away
rose is coughing looks miserable
a shot of buddy and doll in the living room of the hillyer home at night
doll is half heartedly practicing scales on the piano and buddy is pacing the floor hands clasped behind him in something like the style of his father
as the camera follows buddy in his pacing we see waski playing with marbles on the floor
turns around on piano stool to buddy what is rose going to do
where can she go
theyve been in there the longest kind of time
i cant stand it i gotta find out whats going on
you better not snoop daddyll kill you
cut to a shot of buddy coming with great furtiveness from the living room out into the front hall
very cautiously he tiptoes across the hall and bows down and listens at the door of his mothers bedroom study
he crouches down peeps through the keyhole
cut to a keyhole shot of daddy and mother in the bedroom
mother sits in her study chair a handkerchief to her eyes
daddy sits in a chair nearby
he looks depressed
im sorry darlin i hate it as much as you do
wanly well she does seem to cause a lot of trouble i admit
but she doesnt mean any harm and itll break the childrens hearts they all love her
its because of the children shes got to go
i dont want to be holier than thou but the girl doesnt have the same outlook we do
morals dont mean a thing to her not a thing and we cant have a girl like that in this house
who is to say our morals are better than hers
frowns sighs but maybe youre right
that is exactly what im afraid of
pauses and firmly the girl has got to go darlin
but morals come from the heart not from rigid rules and empty laws
and in her heart rose has never hurt anyone and she never would
therefore shes not immoral
now look darlin this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension
but what i said is the simple truth
and now i see something else i see more deeply into it
mother has a slightly other worldly look on her face
daddy glances at the door of the bedroom he suspects something
just a moment darlin
cut to a shot of buddy crouched at the keyhole
with great alacrity he jumps up and hurries across the hall and shuts the living room door just as daddy whisks open the bedroom door
could of sworn that boy was out here
daddy shuts the door and at once almost like the movement of a ballet buddy opens the living room door and tiptoes back to the keyhole
cut to a shot of daddy and mother
it is another keyhole shot
how could rose really be a bad influence on dolly
she has a loving nature you ought to want someone like that around your children
why do you think those boys and men like her
well i have a pretty good idea
if you mean sex you couldnt be more wrong
rose likes those boys and men she has love in her heart and that is what they want
its the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her
they follow her because shes a he is about to say piece of tail but interrupts himself no i wont say that
what she doesnt understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people
shes young shes got to learn to restrain the life force thats in her
its creative but in her case its too creative
darlin rose has got to go
rises ill talk to her ill reason with her
cut to a shot of buddy in the hall
he jumps up and hurries across the hall into the living room
again as the living room door shuts the bedroom door opens
mother starts up the stairs her mouth determined
cut to a shot of buddy and doll and waski in the living room
mother is struggling desperately
in fact shes fighting like a tiger
but i dont know its close its mighty close
pauses then in a low tone slightly wide eyed buddy
does rose really
do it with all those boys and men
aloofly like daddy doll dont ask childish questions
indignantly to doll of course not
oh waski you dont even know what were talking about
cut to a shot of mother going down the upstairs hall
she knocks on roses door and enters
cut to a shot of mother as she walks over and stares down in shock at rose on the bad
rose is lying back on a pillow and staring groggily at her obviously not quite all there
frowning with worry mother sits beside her and puts a hand on her forehead
rose youre very sick
youre burning up
rose can you hear me
semi delirious what
cut to a shot of an ambulance pulling up outside the hillyer house
attendants get out of it carrying a stretcher
cut to a shot of buddy doll and waski in the front hall
they are badly frightened even terrified
the camera pans to show the ambulance attendants carrying rose strapped in a stretcher down the stairs as mother helps and daddy follows both of them very worried
rose is conscious now and her eyes roll with terror toward the children
theyre takin me to the hospital
dont let em dont let em
the camera stays on the frightened silent children as they stare after rose on the stretcher

a nurse leads them to a door and opens it
cut to a shot of a hospital room
a very pale sick looking rose lies in a hospital bed

another angle close on rose as she weakly turns her head on the pillow
her eyes well with tears as she recognizes the children
a feeble whisper pray for me
another angle on the nurse as she speaks in a whisper we dont hear to mother and daddy obviously telling them theyd better go
daddy beckons to the children and they start to leave all looking depressed
cut to a shot of dr
robert martinson a rather unpleasant man with a spade beard
he has a superior patronizing way of talking and very little southern accent if any
the scene is his office and he is in a swivel chair behind his desk
as he speaks the camera pulls back to show daddy mother and the hillyer children
hillyer the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive
but not many people walk away from double pneumonia madam not many
she looks terrible just awful
of course she does and i must say im puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital
i should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill
she hid it from us doctor
shes afraid of the hospital
a thin superior smile afraid of the hospital
deathly afraid of it
her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesnt know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals
frowns in open disbelief a tenant farm
are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt
well her people were very poor
she says she was often hungry as a child and im sure the food she ate was pretty awful not a balanced diet at all
exactly and thats why she couldnt possibly have come from such a farm
icily polite excuse me sir are you calling my wife a liar
embarrassed honey please
a thin unpleasant smile its simply that i find it incredible mr
aside from the girls illness at the moment she is very strong a very healthy specimen of a young human female and a comely one too
she must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child if only sporadically
it is kind of amazing
the dentist says she has perfect teeth there isnt a cavity in her mouth
tries to make a supercilious joke her entire mouth is a cavity madam ha ha ha
dryly doesnt like the man a bit ha ha ha ha
mother frowns at daddy and dr
martinson gives him an aloof glance
with spurious dignity the point is you dont grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits
she got protein somewhere shes a very strong girl and i think shell live
despite the delay in medical treatment
thats all i want to know
rises lets get out of here before i get the epizootics myself
thank you doctor for your discourse it was fascinating no doubt
yes thank you doctor
as they leave i beg your pardon epi zoo tics
do you mean epi zoo ot tics an animal epidemic
icily polite from the door no i mean epizootics
cut to a shot of mother daddy buddy doll and waski as daddy comes out of the doctors office and shuts the door
i cant stand that polecat
they ought to hang him
you dont like him because hes a yankee
hes a brilliant doctor
hes a polecat dear
cut to a shot of daddy mother and the hillyer children in a hospital elevator as a black elevator operator runs them down
daddy has his hat politely removed and is staring pensively ahead
rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed
sighs shakes his head i hope shell be all right but i still think we ought to fire her
i dont see how you can even think of it now
daddy purses his lips but says nothing
it is obvious the epizootics have saved rose at least for the time being
a shot of rose in bed in her own bedroom
she is propped up on pillows and wearing a rather attractive pink silk housecoat of mothers
a tray is on her lap and she is eating her supper as buddy sits on the edge of the bed talking with her or rather listening to her
it is obvious she is well on the road back to health
oh hes so kind so gentle inside and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesnt understand him her being a southerner and everything and what a bedside manner he
has got so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts
rose you are too uncritical of people
you dont know the bedside manner that man has got
why it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin in his bag like hes gonna cure me which he did of course
and even more important he loves me like a patient i mean the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin to my heart beat
yeah he tried to hide it but i saw em and a little bit he says to me you know you are beautiful
now wasnt that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient wasnt it
what could cheer a girl up more
rose i have got doubts about that doctor and so does daddy
hes got doubts about hisself and thats the saddest thing of all
would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him
yeah id believe it
well i like him
i used to be afraid of doctors but not any more
why he could operate on me any old time and i wouldnt even be scared
rose you are just entirely too uncritical of people
i aint neither
listen here buddy besides all his vast medical knowledge he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts he wants justice in the world and hes got
some real interestin ideas
cut to a shot of mother opening the front door
martinson is there with his black bag an icy polite look on his face
oh good evening doctor
rose is a lot better i just gave her her supper
shes almost all well now
let me be the judge of that madam
cut to a shot of buddy and rose in roses bedroom
justice thats what he wants justice for everybody and especially for niggers
and i think thats real nice of him because black people dont have a very good life you got to admit that to be a nigger is sometimes practicly fatal
but the wife dont understand all of that she thinks niggers are just so much dirt which anybody ought to know better if they been on their ass their ownselves and that is the cause of his profound unhappiness buddy that no good mean wife with all her southern prejudice against niggers and everything
it is a very long speech and delivered with a non stop vitality that leaves buddy a trifle groggy
slowly he shakes his head as enter mother
the doctor is here
and brother supper is ready
a shot of the hillyer family minus rose eating dinner in the dining room
the meal is almost finished daddy cutting apple pie
is that doctor still up there brother
yeah hes still up there
whats taking the rascal so long
martinson isnt a rascal hes one of the finest physicians in glenville
he studied at johns hopkins university
i dont care where the polecat studied
sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit
shakes her head sadly as buddy surreptitiously puts his napkin on table your real trouble is that youre anti intellectual
the irony is women are supposed to be emotional but i never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do
a half audible murmur excuse me gotta go to bathroom
now i have a plan about rose an educational plan
shes getting better and we dont want any more trouble notices buddy slipping out brother you ought to hear this
ill be right back
the camera follows buddy as he slips out during following speech
first those clothes she wears
theyre too provocative
ive talked to her a lot about it and i think she understands
cut to a shot of buddy as he goes down the hall eyes narrowed
on buddy posted in the doorway of the living room
he has his hands on his hips daddy style and is staring sternly up the stairs
cut to a pov shot of dr
martinson with his black bag in hand and shoulders hunched coming down the stairs
the man is slinking has quilt written all over him
as he goes down the stairs he glances to one side sees buddy and frowns
the man gives a sudden nervous start of fright as we hear daddys voice loud on the track
everything all right doctor
cut to a pov shot of daddy at the rear of the downstairs hall napkin in hand and hands on hips
he is staring sternly at the doctor
cut back to the doctor
he glances nervously again toward buddy
another pov shot of buddy
looks just like daddy hands on hips
martinson as he looks back at daddy
a few more days
a little more rest
shell be perfectly healthy
another angle on daddy as he walks forward down the hall toward buddy
the camera picks up buddy and both of them grimly stare after the fleeing doctor
in a low conspiratorial tone what do you think brother
i dont know
but you better watch him like a hawk if he comes back again
hes not coming back again
we scared the rascal off son
puts a hand on buddys shoulder come on back to supper
your mother has a theory about how to educate rose
a shot of mother and rose and the children in the kitchen
we see a sewing machine and evidences of dressmaking
rose has on a new and modest little dress that mother evidently has made for her
you see rose
now thats the kind of dress you ought to wear
less than enthusiastic yeah its kinda nice
you look very pretty in it rose
really you do
smiles at mother well youre real sweet to make it for me
puts an arm around mothers shoulder there never was nobody like you
and you dont need to worry i aint goin out no more
well theres no reason you shouldnt go out rose
a little shrug i dont want to
when i was lyin there in that hospital bed at deaths door i says to myself i aint goin out no more
if i ever get outta this ill just stay home
rose casually pulls the dress over her head and stands there in panties and bra oblivious of buddy and the children
she has about as much modesty as a small child herself
rather sadly besides there aint no mr
right out there
or if there is i cant find him all i find is a pile of mr
i aint goin out no more
a shot of daddy mother rose and the children all in their sunday best going up the steps of a church
rose looks virginal in the modest dress mother made for her
a shot of rose mother daddy and the children on a bench in church
we hear singing
rose looks innocent virginal as she sings
mother gives her an approving look exchanges glances with daddy
cut to a shot of the hillyer family coming out of church
we see them shaking hands with the minister
rose smiles sweetly modestly
cut to a shot of the model a driving up in the driveway of the hillyer house
another angle on them all as they get out of the car
rose takes dolls hand with one hand and waskis hand with the other
all right well play monopoly then
mother daddy and buddy watch rose go up the steps with doll and waski
shes like a different person
being so sick made a big impression on her
i really think shes learned a lesson
waits as mother goes on up steps then turns to buddy and in a low tone come with me brother
i want to show you something
cut to a shot of daddy and buddy in a rose garden below the windows of the house
it is hawkshaw the detective and his unwilling assistant
daddy solemnly points to dim marks in the flower bed
see that son
now this is a heel see and there thats the ball of a foot
someone has been walking here
reluctantly well its not very plain
that is because it rained recently the rain has obscured the evidence
but you could still take plaster casts of these footprints then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are and that way you could catch him understand
but how would you find him
well what i mean is you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him
but look this brother it is even more interesting
look at this mark here and that mark over there
now wouldnt you say those marks are the marks of a ladder
well i dont know
trying to sound like a fellow detective but doesnt want rose to get caught no i dont know daddy i think the rain has obscured it
true but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder
now lets go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with
cut to a shot of daddy and buddy back in the garage
they are scrutinizing a wooden ladder that hangs on pegs alongside the garage
all daddy needs is a cap and a pipe to be a dead ringer for sherlock holmes
he is in dead earnest about this it is no joke and he does not dream of being funny
points to ladder eyes narrowed see son
the paint is flaked off here freshly
look at it brother there is no question about it
some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder
and theres only one reason anybody would want this ladder to get up into roses bedroom in the dark of night
i am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it
and that is not all i am going to do
buddy stares at him in apprehension
a shot of the whole family at dinner including rose
daddy puts down his napkin
that was a delicious repast rose as usual
now i have something of grave import to say to you and to mrs
pauses points at buddy and i dont want you children snooping do you hear me brother
go up to your rooms
cut to a shot of buddy doll and waski in the upstairs
they tiptoe along furtively
cut to a shot of the children going down backstairs
cut to a shot of buddy leading doll and waski down the steps of the cellar
the camera follows as they walk past an ancient coal burning furnace and
climb up into a crawl space beneath the front of the house
a shot of buddy doll and waski crawling along on dirt in the crawl space under the house
they come to a floor heat ventillator grill and stop
buddy holds his fingers to his lips and listens intently
cut to a shot of daddy mother and rose in mothers bedroom study
we see the grillwork of the heat ventillator in the floor
daddy is at the climax of his speech
we all love you rose
even more now since youve bravely surmounted all these epizootics
we admire you we esteem you we hold your hand with love and affection we have an investment in you and i dont mean money although god knows we have
that too considering those godawful hospital bills
cut to a shot close on buddy doll and waski in the crawl space
buddy is smiling in relief
he whispers to doll and waski
hes not going to fire her
cut back to daddy mother and rose in the bedroom study
i mean a human investment rose we care about you you matter to us
but we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop
do you hear me
meekly yes sir
a bit overwhelmed by daddy she hasnt actually done anything
very firmly just a moment dear
turns to rose and almost sadly we cant have it rose
can you behave yourself or not
that is the question to behave or not to behave to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the
light of the moon and make whoopee that is the coil shuffling question
a dramatic pause then points at her if you cant behave i am going to fire you and i say it in front of you and mrs
hillyer and i mean it
i point my rigid finger right at your nose rose and i stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and i tell you
this is a final warning
do you hear me
very meekly yes sir
cut to a shot of buddy doll and waski as they climb from the crawl space down into the cellar by the furnace
well if shes got any sense at all shell listen to that
sense doesnt mean anything to rose
but i think were on safe ground now
daddy chained up the ladder whoever it is cant get in the house
a shot of buddy sound asleep in his bed in the early gray dawn
as we dissolve in on the shot we hear a loud banging and daddys voice
open that door
open it up open it this instant
do you hear met open that door
buddy sits quickly up in bed at once pushes back the covers and gets out of the bed hurriedly reaches for his khaki pants
cut to a shot of daddy in the upstairs hall
he is fully dressed and is banging angrily on roses door
open this goddamn door
open it or ill break it down
another angle on buddy as he hurries down the hall up to daddy in khaki pants and pulling a shirt over his head
open that door damn you
daddy whats the matter
glances around at him shes got somebody in there brother
his shoes are on the back porch there they were naked and smiling at me
bangs on door rose open this door immediately
another angle on daddy as he bangs on the door
we see a frightened doll in her nightgown in the b
down the hall a hand to her mouth
daddy commences kicking at the door
another angle close on daddy
open up rose
procrastination wont help you
finally the click of a bolt and slowly the door opens
we see a wide eyed terrified rose
she has a sheet around her and evidently nothing more
he pushes past her all right where is he
wheres the culprit
cut to a shot of daddy in the bedroom
he yanks open the closet door looks under the bed as he talks
where is he
i know hes in here where is he rose
his shoes were on the back porch i smiling at met where are you you son of a bitch
in her distress and dismay the sheet has come down over roses shoulder and one of her breasts is exposed
feebly she is terrified there aint nobody here mr
honest there aint
where is he
where have you got him hid
notices curtain blowing in wide open window ah ha
the camera follows daddy as he strides angrily toward the window and leans out of it and stares down
rose makes a little whimpering sound
cut to a pov shot of the garden below as seen by daddy from the window
we see lying on the ground billy the sulky boy who scared mother
he wears only undershorts and is groaning holding his leg which evidently he has injured in jumping from the window
on daddy as he turns from the window to rose
and who rose may i ask is that
well its billy
and what may i ask was billy doing here
a straight answer well mr
hillyer billys very poor he dont have no money and there wasnt no place else to go
well it was a silly question
hes a nice boy youd like him
he wants to be a fireman
ye gods and little fishes a fireman
put on some clothes rose youre naked as a jay bird
when youre dressed come on downstairs
im afraid your friend billy is injured where are his clothes
begins weeping both breasts now are exposed under the mattress
i hid em so you wouldnt be mad
he wants to marry me he loves me
i cant marry him hes too young and hasnt got no job but he loves me
now you wouldnt hurt him would you
daddy gently pulls the sheet around her to cover her breasts
i wont hurt him honey
a shot of daddy mother and rose at the kitchen table drinking coffee in the early morning
daddy looks grave mother looks sad and rose is crying into a handkerchief
hillyer i know it was bad and i hadnt ought to of done it
but im only a human girl and i
i aint always perfect
i promise i wont let him in the house no more i promise
wont you and mrs
hillyer forgive me
rose darlin you break my heart
but i am only a human man myself of the father variety
rose pack your bag baby as of this moment you are hired mired and fired
a shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room
the dissolve suggests that some time has gone by
daddy looks a bit grim rose has a wan and depressed expression
mother looks worried
politely well rose going out to look for a job today
eyes down whats the use there aint none
would you get me another half a cup of coffee dear
rose rises and he watches her leave then turns to mother
it has been three weeks since i fired her
is there no way to get rid of this girl
are we stuck with her for life
she cant get a job its a depression
and we cant just throw her out on the street
the hell we cant
rose returns with coffee and pours it out for daddy
rose you dont look well and you havent eaten a bit of breakfast
im not hungry
i cant eat nothin i havent been able to eat since i got fired
i think maybe im sick
youre not sick rose forget it
dont get any notions in your head youre not sick
she does look a little peaky
no she doesnt shes fine fine
shes perfectly healthy dont give her ideas
well ill do the dishes then im goin to lie down a minute and rest
my stomach hurts
daddy watches rose exit to the kitchen then leans forward and speaks to mother his expression a bit sly
her plan is obvious plain as day
shes going on a hunger strike
the question is how do we foil her
shes just nervous and worried
and you would be too if you had no job and no place to go
thinking hard something has got to be done or rose is going to be in this house forever
a shot of the model a coming up the driveway of the hillyer house
it is late afternoon
cut to a shot of daddy getting out of the car
he has a triumphant little smile on his face
a shot of daddy as he walks onto the patio a rolled up copy of the glenville tribune in his hand and his straw hat on the back of his
he definitely has a triumphant expression
buddy on the patio notices it
cut to a shot of the kitchen on mother and rose
mother is helping a rather wan rose prepare dinner
as if everyone will be pleased well i have got news
i called long distance and spoke to cousin hop and youll be glad to know rose i have found you a job
yes tennessee a lovely state
what kinda job is it
ahh hh youll like it
its a fine outdoor type job
you mean a farm
no no not exactly
it isnt a farm in the sense that its a farm
not at all
youll ike it
im sure youll like it because its so
rose bows her head and begins crying
honey rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life
now i dont think just a minute rose you dont understand
this isnt a dirt farm like the one you were born on its nice
a neighbor of cousin hops i talked to him on the phone a fine man
its not a farm damn it its a beautiful dairy establishment
stop crying rose
do you hear me
stop crying its ideal
i dont know how you can call it ideal dont you know what the word farm means to her
i dont give a hoot in hells hollow what it means to her
she cant stay in this house forever
i fired her damn it
it sounds like a farm to me
calling it a dairy establishment thats just trickery and flummery
trickery and flummery or not shes going there tomorrow on the bus
and i must say weve been more than fair to you rose its pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that
rose sits head bowed at the kitchen table
im not cryin because of me im cryin because of somebody else
stops in mid air so to speak what
cut to a shot of buddy outside on the patio listening intently at the window
he leans forward with a keen interest eyes wide
cut to a shot close on daddy
he is peering intently at rose
what did you say rose
close on rose as she turns weeping
well i was born on a farm myself
and i hate to think of the baby being born on one
on them all
daddy and mother stare in shock at rose
what baby are you speaking about
im going to have one
he is poleaxed staggered good god almighty
this is a catastrophe they wont hire her
looks up sees buddy in patio window brother get out of that window
buddy ducks down out of eight instantly
both mother and daddy however are too preoccupied and upset to be concerned with him
stares off groggily into space this is a total catastrastroke
as of this moment i am stumped i admit i am stumped and treed both the hound dogs have me surrounded
as rose begins crying poor thing dont cry rose
i know you feel awful but dont cry honey nobodys perfect
whos the father dear
i dont know
maybe it was
but no you cant be sure about a thing like that
it wasnt billy i didnt know him
gently i know its embarrassing
but who were you exposed to dear
well now mrs
ah h thats kinda hard to say
youre not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning
the problem is what are we going to do
thats why im asking her who the father is
its the most vital question of all
whos the father dear
offhand he is thinking hard about what to do she already told you she doesnt know
naively but she must know
rose was there more than one person
weeping in handkerchief oh h mrs
i cant think
im not really sure
gently a tiny frown a bit shocked rose really you shouldnt act like that
weeping oh i know
but i didnt really
honestly i didnt
there was only one but hes out of town and leave no forwardin address
a brilliant idea ah ha
hold the phone
no forwarding address huh
turns to mother in the shock of this brilliant move i forgot something
what did you forget
i forgot that rose will lie like a child
shes no more pregnant than i am she just doesnt want to go to that farm
yes i am
no youre not
hillyer i am
triumphant sure hes right all right tell us rose what makes you think youre pregnant
simply i havent had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big
again poleaxed for a moment but pulls himself together i dont believe it
its so mr
all right damn it
weve seen you with your clothes off around here stand up and pull up your dress and lets take a look
she doesnt have to take her panties off we can see her stomach with em on
all she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly
well all right if you just wont believe me
rose stands up
rose you dont have to
i dont mind
now you will see shes lying like she always does that belly will be flat as a pancake
rose lifts her dress and daddy leans forward eagerly to confirm his belief
rose stands there with her skirt lifted
she has on a pair of skimpy white panties
an unmistakable definite protrusion can be seen in the area below her navel just above the line of her panties
a stupefied look is on daddys face
id say about three months
are you satisfied
i am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition
i wash my hands or the whole thing
cut to a shot of doll walking up onto the patio with schoolbooks
the camera follows her as she walks over to buddy who is crouched down eavesdropping at another window
she whispers to him
whats goin on
rose says shes goin to have a baby and she sure looks it but i dont think so
and she isnt even married
thats the least of her troubles
rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up she told me all about it
if it isnt a baby
what is it
a shot of buddy and rose in a rather elegant doctors waiting room
it is night and they are alone on a small sofa
buddy has a very solemn and worried look
rose lies weeping in terror on his shoulder
oh buddy theyre gonna cut me all up
theyre gonna cut my stummick all open ill die
trying to be brave you wont die rose
buddy im scared im scared
cut to a shot of dr
martinsons private office in his home quite a bit more luxurious than his office at the hospital
a sober looking mother and daddy sit talking to him
he almost seems to relish the situation
im not surprised you thought she was pregnant
an ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy
but it was pure wishful thinking on her part
the girl can never have children she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated
shocked rather feebly gonorrhea
dont worry madam she cant infect your dear little kiddies
she long ago fully recovered but the disease did irreparable damage
the girl is permanently barren
well thats pathetic
poor rose what a life she has had
we make our own lives madam
as for malignancy i dont think so its very unlikely
i probably shouldnt have even mentioned that possibility to her
rather coldly seems disenchanted with him no you shouldnt have it was needlessly cruel
she thinks she has cancer and is going to die
shes an adult mrs
hillyer i was merely giving her the facts
well its a disaster
i dont know what to say doctor i am floored
how dangerous is the operation
any major operation is dangerous
however as we know from her previous illness shes a very strong girl
well if it isnt malignant and she can get through the operation all right it might be better than her really being pregnant
she doesnt even know who the father might have been
oh its definitely better beyond question
a fatherless child an ignorant girl with no job no money no home
its fortunate a blessing really and a stroke of good luck for another reason i want to mention to you
totally disenchanted with the doctor this conversation is making me a little sick
honey thats no way to talk to the doctor hes merely doing his job dear
oddly enough in the stress of the situation daddy now seems almost friendly to dr
martinson whom previously he considered a polecat
cut to a shot of buddy and rose in the waiting room
he is helping her lie on the couch on pillows as she weeps a hand over her face
i gotta find out what theyre saying
you lie back and rest rose and ill give you a report on it
i dont want to know
cut to a close shot of dr
an expression of distaste is on his face
the camera pulls back as he talks to mother and daddy
im sorry the truth nauseates you mrs
hillyer because before you leave theres a bit more of it id like to put to you
this operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that i feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain
psychoneurotic condition as well
what do you mean what kind of gobbledygook talk is that
go ahead doctor i think i am following you
gives mother an aloof glance then to daddy first about the girls history
evidently shes been very promiscuous since early childhood she has no control over her sexual impulses
furthermore she is permanently barren she cant have children
go on doctor
quietly yes go on
i am thinking particularly of the other ovary
as a rule i dont believe in removing it
the womans hormonal system is profoundly disturbed she is subject to possibly serious depression she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example her breasts might shrink and become
flabby facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished especially in a girl or young woman
for these reasons i am opposed to removing the other ovary as a rule
do you follow me
i am ahead of you
may i speak quite frankly with you mr
i have of course observed the girl in treating her
i think we both know her
yes we know her
what are you talking about
i dont understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces
hillyer this girl is sick in more ways than one
she is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses
it would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others
therefore i recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary
it is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and i suspect your husband agrees with me
reluctantly i do
it would be a blessing to her and everyone else
the girl is oversexed and i say spay her
slowly rises to her feet and in a trembling voice over
a long frozen pause as both daddy and dr
martinson stare at mother in surprise
she stares at the doctor with fire in her eyes
he seems already to shrink a little
finally she speaks with a calm fury
are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters
is there no limit to which you wont go to keep your illusions about yourselves
shrinking a little illusions madam
youd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself youd go that far
dont you think i know what youve just said and dont you think i understand the dreadful and revolting crime youve just conspired to commit
martinson stares at her in fear and shock intimidated by the calm fury and ice cold moral indignation
he opens his mouth as if to speak but no sound comes out
mother turns to daddy
i thought i knew you
i thought i knew you better i thought in your heart you were a good and kind man
well i cant believe what ive just heard in this room
a defenseless girl depending on you for protection and you propose to mutilate and destroy her
how could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man
slightly shattered well now darlin
give me a chance to defend myself
i cant believe you really meant it if i did id want to die
you arent a male monster that man is but you arent
look me in the eye and tell me do you really want to take roses womanhood away from her when its all she has got
i hadnt thought about it that much
i was thinking
well its an idea the girl is oversexed and
rose isnt oversexed thats ridiculous
if youre going to talk nonsense i dont want to talk to you at all
rose is exactly the same as the rest of us except more so
well i know more so
thats why i was thinking
maybe shed be better off
with a quiet fury better off
how could she ever find love and happiness if you did what youre talking about
are you insane
rather feebly now may i say i am against that particular procedure as a general rule
but in a case of near nymphomania it doesnt seem monstrous to me at all but medically advisable
both mother and daddy totally ignore him
mothers eyes are fixed on daddy and he is struggling with himself staring down at the floor
well now i admit
in roses case it would be cruel
if rose wasnt attractive and pretty
well it would probably be bad for almost any young woman
i dont know exactly what i was thinking about the doctor said it and it sounded reasonable
daddy finally looks up at mother and admits his error like a man
but youre right darlin youre absolutely dead right it would be an awful and horrible thing to do
im sorry honey forgive me i didnt mean it
mother turns from daddy and walks up to the desk and stares down at dr
martinson as if he is a loathesome bug upon which she intends to step
i will not cry like a woman
if im upset its because of what my husband said not because of you
you cant make me cry like a woman a woman has got just as much intelligence and self control as a man
and you get this in your head
if you hurt that girl ill hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got ill do my level best to ruin you
do you understand me
a sickly smile he is licked totally yes i understand you but you have misunderstood me completely
icy cold i understand you perfectly
you leave that girl alone you wretched man or you will be sorry
a foolish smile as if mother has paid him some kind of compliment actually of course i wont operate i dont do major surgery
hardy will operate and of course hell be guided by your wishes in this respect
let him be guided not by my wishes and not by roses wishes although i am sure they are identical
let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself because that is what has spoken through me tonight
a shot of the model a parked on the street outside a hospital in a small southern town
we see daddy slowly pacing back and forth in front of the hospital entrance his head bowed and his hands clasped behind him
another angle closer on the model a
buddy sits in the middle on the front seat mother is at the window
doll and waski are on the back seat
they all are staring with pale worry at the pacing daddy fifty feet away
all are frightened mother is very pale
doll has a tiny handkerchief to her eyes and is half crying
even waski is very scared
seems on verge of tears mother
is rose going to die
in a trembly voice no waski she wont die because we are praying for her
cut to a shot of daddy from the pov of the car
he looks at his wristwatch frowns and walks into the entrance of the hospital
another angle on them all in the car
they wait pale and silent
doll sniffles in her handkerchief
why is it taking so long
here comes daddy
cut to a pov shot of daddy as he slowly walks up to the car his straw hat in his hand
cut to a shot of mother close on her face as she stares at her husband as if trying to read the news on his face
a tiny frown comes on her forehead as icy fear comes in her eyes
another angle close on daddy as he walks up to the window of the car hat in hand
a trace of tears can be seen in his eyes but when he speaks his voice is calm
philosophically well i thought id seen the limit but these are the most great gaga epizootics shes ever had
another angle on daddy and them all
in pale fear mother stares at him uncertain what has happened
how is she
as mother sighs in heartfelt relief
a shot of daddy sitting with mother at the kitchen table
bright cheerful sunshine comes in the window that opens on the patio
rose comes into the shot carrying a coffee pot a sunny smile on her face
youre looking very chipper this morning rose
sow do you feel
perfect wonderful good as i ever felt
except for a big old scar on my stummick i wouldnt even know i been in the hospital
with mild irony as she pours him coffee well we know you were there
the bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous
her smile fades a trifle well ill pay you that back sometime mr
dont worry about it honey
daddy pauses seems to be struggling with himself he is frowning
i hate to be mean but
another pause then a little shrug oh nevermind forget it
in a little sad voice what was it mr
rises nothing rose
daddy stops beside her puts an arm around her shoulders and with weary irony
we all love you darlin
daddy wearily picks up his straw hat from the kitchen counter and walks out of the kitchen on the patio as the camera stays on rose and mother
dont worry honey youll find something
i was offered that job as a waitress
forget about it i dont want you working in one of those honky tonks
cut to a shot of buddy on the patio
he has eight or nine gourds on an outdoor table and is cutting round holes in them and emptying out the seed
he glances up as rose walks up to him pocketbook in hand
she seems a little sad
but she smiles at him
puts an arm around his shoulders hows my sweetheart who never told on me when i was bad
picks up a hollowed out gourd makin homes for purple martins huh
we had em on the farm
theyre the prettiest things
thats what i wish i was a bird
just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun
what are you going to do rose
take a little walk with me huh
cut to a shot of rose and buddy on a beautiful summer day walking in the garden behind the hillyer house
they walk up to an empty rabbit hutch
the hutch is made of rough lumber and chicken wire and has cubicles for about a dozen rabbits
as she stares at the empty hutch i guess ill work as a waitress buddy
i done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know but i cant stay here no more
why did you get rid of your rabbits buddy
theyre dumb things
i got tired of them
smiles touches chicken wire did you know when i was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits
five hundred rabbits
yep we had em in orange crates all over
it was daddys dream
he was goin to get rich raisin rabbits
it was what killed daddy
he didnt drown hisself till a long time later after momma and lunette died of typhoid but it was them rabbits what killed him
how did the rabbits kill him
he thought he could sell em but nobody but country folks eat rabbits buddy and they aint got no money
we had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves
every dern one and it took about four years to eat em all up
a little smile well that doctor said you got protein somewhere and i guess he was right
boy did i get sick of rabbit
but later on after momma died and daddy wasnt doin nothin but drinkin i sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew
you know i oughtnt to of told you about what daddy done when i was a child
until them rabbits ruined him he was a real good man buddy
what was your mother like
a saint just like your own mother
shes up in heaven right now her and lunette there aint no doubt about it
another angle as buddy and rose walk away hand in hand away from the rabbit hutch
maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy rose
buddy sex dont mean a thing to me
it aint nothin but a mosquito bite
stops smiles puts an arm around his shoulders ill tell you a secret
girls dont want sex buddy girls want love
a shot of mother and daddy in the hillyer living room late at night
mother sits with a worried expression on a chair a kimono around her shoulders
daddy is pacing worriedly in pajamas and a bathrobe
he looks at his wristwatch
its twenty after one
i dont understand it
even in the wild days she was never as late as this
im afraid its my fault
i made her feel guilty this morning glances around sees something in doorway brother what are you doing up
another angle on buddy in pajamas as he enters the living room
i heard you talking
hasnt rose come in
no she hasnt
frowns looks around i think i hear a car
cut to a shot of a s automobile in the hillyer driveway at night as it drives up and stops before the front steps
another angle close on rose and dave wilkie in the car
here dave is much younger of course and a rather handsome man in a stolid way
even though he is younger than when we saw him on the plane he is quite a bit older than rose
roses eyes are opened wide she is a bit breathless obviously something important has happened
dave stares at her as if fascinated almost as if awed
rather stiffly i want to thank you for a wonderful afternoon and evenin
can i see you in the mornin
a bit breathless yes
year you can you sure can
cut to a shot of daddy peering out of the window of the living room
why that looks like dave wilkie who
you know dave his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died
cut to a shot of rose on the steps
happy as a clam she turns and waves at dave in the car then goes on up the steps
cut to a shot of the front hall as rose comes through the front door
she is very excited happy
the camera follows her as she goes into the living room with her big news
youll never guess what happened
pauses then dramatically i have met mr

well thats wonderful rose
and who do you suppose he is
that policeman who arrested me the one i bit

various shots of a wedding in a tiny country church
we see shots of rose in a white wedding dress smiling happy
dave is stiff and solemn in his best suit
daddy gravely gives rose away
we hear no dialogue here music on track
we see mother buddy doll and waski in the front row all in sunday best and very solemn
we see a close shot of roses knees trembling beneath her white wedding dress as a country minister marries them
various shots of a rather idyllic country wedding in a very plain unpretentious country church and
a shot of rose dave buddy doll and waski at a picnic celebration outside the church by a running brook
the scene should be beautiful in summertime
we see a barbecue pit homemade ice cream in the metal can other picnic things
a happy rose is kissing first buddy then doll then waski
dave smiles fondly but rather stiffly at her
and now waski are you and buddy and dolly ready for some ice cream huh
do you like picnics or dont you
we like em
we love em
well it isnt a picnic honey
its a barbecue
a little smile okay
a picnic doesnt involve roast meat hon
at a barbecue you have a lot of roast meat
cut to a shot close on buddy as he stares pensively at dave
the camera stays on him as we hear voices over
rose is happy dave phlegmatic
well all i know is theres ice cream
and im gonna have me a plate right now
better wait hon
itll spoil your appetite
have some barbecue first
the camera stays on buddy as he stares pensively at dave
he has no expression on his face at all
a shot of rose and dave bidding goodbye to the hillyers
daddy mother buddy doll and waski are in the model a
rose is obviously on the verge of tears as dave speaks solemnly to daddy

begins crying oh mr

daddy starts the model a

another angle on rose as she weeps and waves the handkerchief
a shot of daddy and mother in the model a as daddy drives

well thank god we are rid of her at last
and the best thing of all is that shes happy
the little nut is happy she found mr
right in the nick of time
well yes shes happy
of course dave doesnt have her life force not at all
there isnt much furniture in his house just a table and one or two chairs whereas rose has furniture coming out of the windows
honey he is mr
slowly nods yes i think so
he adores her its almost pitiful the way he worships her
i just hope she isnt too much for him
mother pauses frowning she has her doubts looks over her shoulder
what do you think brother
mother frowns in surprise
cut to a pov shot of buddy on the back seat of the car
now it is clear why we couldnt see him in the other shot
be is lying down on the seat of the car with his sunday coat pulled over his head
another angle on mother and buddy doll waski
buddy lies on the seat motionless with his coat over his head
whats the matter with him
seems awed staring down at buddy i dont know
i think hes cryin
cut to another angle on mother from the front as she slowly turns back and stares thoughtfully ahead
the shot is also on daddy
they both stare ahead in pensive silence
finally mother speaks
rather sadly maybe brother is right
on willcox hillyer behind the wheel of the hertz car
he is staring pensively ahead a faint trace of tears in his eyes
it is a very faint trace a look of mild irony and amusement is on his face
dryly to himself mr
willcox slowly shakes his head
cut to a shot of the red ford as it takes a turn off from an interstate
cut to a shot of the red ford as it drives into a rather bustling little southern city that does not look at all like the glenville we have seen
a lot of traffic new roads filling stations prosperity
it could be rome georgia as it is today
another shot of the red ford going past a modern holiday inn in the city
on the red ford as it turns into a familiar driveway that of the old hillyer home
but insofar as possible it looks different now like a relic from the past
maybe the house needs painting the garden is in weeds the place is not exactly dilapidated but it is marked by time
a shot of willcox hillyer as he gets out of the red ford and walks up the familiar steps of the front porch travel bag in hand
on willcox hillyer at the front door
he tries the knob opens the door and goes inside
cut to a shot of willcox hillyer as he glances into the living room
the room looks the same but different it is musty dim
willcox hillyer stares at it as if haunted a bit turns and the camera follows him as he crosses the hall and looks into mothers old bedroom study
this room is quite different
the four poster is gone
the room is dusty musty dark
magazines are on the floor in a ring around mothers old study chair
we see male things
it is apparent daddy lives alone in this room
a shot of willcox hillyer as he walks down the familiar hall back to the kitchen
he looks around
no one is there
he glances at a modern refrigerator that is in pretty poor shape glances with a frown at dishes in the sink unwashed
he goes on out to the patio
cut to a shot of daddy putting out seed for birds on a table on the patio
daddy now is a very old man but his personality and style are the same as ever
he looks up with a stern frown as willcox hillyer comes out on the patio
well you rascal whered you come from
how are you
about as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave
good to see you son
they shake hands did you bring any of that yankee whisky with you
it isnt yankee whisky daddy its scotch
its yankee whisky to me
daddy takes him by the arm leads him back into the kitchen
how do you stand it up there boy in all that ice and snow
what are you a polar bear
cut to a shot of willcox hillyer and daddy as they enter the kitchen
the former opens his travel bag and takes out a bottle of teachers
i can use a drink after the plane ride i had
your wife and children are back in new hampshire in the snow
a little smile it is summer there couldnt be snow in new hampshire yeah theyre in the snow
willcox opens whisky looks for glasses in the dusty familiar cupboard
are they polar bears too
frowns at cupboard good god the way you live here
this place hasnt been dusted since mother died
look at that goddamned refrigerator
got another twenty years in it boy
something seems to be bothering him by the way son do you recall rose that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in or and caused such
a damnable commotion
frowns turns and stares at him of course i recall rose
in fact ive been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half
how could that be son
dave wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane her first husband
its funny you would mention rose
did you hear from her
willcox pours out whisky
casually well yes in a manner of speaking
youll have the back bedroom son mothers old art room
just be careful going down the stairs you dont break your yankee neck
cut to a shot of willcox hillyer and daddy as they walk with their drinks out to the patio
whats all this about rose
what do you mean you heard from her in a manner of speaking
oh i heard from her i got a letter from her shes fine
but there is some sad news
what sad news
did her cancer come back
oh no no she got all over that
rose is fine
lets sit down son
is her husband sick or something
no its another thing
i was going to write you about it but since you were coming down anyway i thought id wait till you got here
what did dave wilkie have to say
another angle on willcox hillyer and the aged daddy as they sit on the patio sipping whisky
willcox hillyer is not disturbed or worried about rose daddy has been very casual and offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news really is
the pitiful son of a bitch said rose was a nymphomaniac
um hmm and i suppose that incensed you
youre damn right it incensed me the miserable bastard
he also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over washington
nods somberly yeah i know he was up here
its pitiful like you say
when he lost rose it ruined the man it destroyed him totally when he lost rose
he didnt lose her he threw her away
yes i guess he did
he threw her away and it was the mistake of his life
staring off pensively into space you know i dont know this town any more
all this traffic new buildings prosperity
pauses almost as if in pain where have the years gone daddy
where is the little town i knew as a boy
at rest in the creative universe with mother son
a little smile thats what she would say herself
simply he is not emoting a wonderful woman boy
it always gives me a funny feeling to come home
dear old southland
its all gone daddy a fond little smile except you youre still here
matter of factly not for long boy
ive outstayed my welcome already
its funny you would mention rose i was thinking about her all the way up in the car
gives him a glance or maybe it isnt so funny
as if in previous thought im older than hell boy
but this yankee whisky is mighty fine ill say that
all right daddy
we have our drink were out on the patio you have prepared me for it
roses cancer has come back hasnt it
simply quietly no son she is dead
numb with shock for a moment cant speak or think dead rose is dead
i am afraid so son
about a week ago
her husband phoned me she had asked him to call me if anything happened
in awful shock but
she was young
rose wasnt old
she was fifty six son
of course she didnt look it nowhere near it
the cancer came back im afraid i fibbed about that
but it was very quick son
she was in the hospital only two weeks and the last week she didnt know anything
in distress a slightly choked voice excuse me ill be right back
willcox hillyer rises with his drink in hand and walks across the patio to the kitchen door
cut to a shot of willcox hillyer as he goes into the kitchen
he picks up the whisky bottle and pours himself a very large drink
another angle close on willcox hillyer as he stares across the kitchen lost in thought
in the kitchen a sunny smile on her face as she pours coffee for daddy
a very quick moment only a few seconds
in the kitchen drink in hand a look of grief on his face
he struggles to control himself puts a hand over his eyes then pulls himself together turns from the kitchen
on willcox hillyer and daddy as the former walks up with his refreshed drink and sits down
he is in control now his face is expressionless and he is seemingly calm
well you have knocked me for a hell of a loop old man
a hell of a loop
simply i know
you loved her
so did i
it was an awful shock to me too
an awful shock
rose was so alive its hard to believe
i cant believe it daddy
i know it must be true but i cant believe it
its true son
the girl with the cornflower eyes is dead she is no more daddy pauses in trouble emotionally but gets a grip on himself and in an almost dispassionate manner but
powerful feeling is behind his words
she got cancer of the breast was operated on and had a seven year recovery then after a brief illness passed on in her sleep as the man with whom
shed lived in beautiful love and harmony for twenty five years held her hand
that is what happened son and god rest her lovely soul
cut to a close shot of willcox hillyer
despite his efforts to control himself tears are in his eyes
he clenches his teeth takes a big swallow of his drink
another angle on them both as daddy rises
and now if you are through with that yankee whisky well go to the holiday inn and get some dinner
as they walk toward the red rental ford
daddy uses a cane
he is a very old man
willcox hillyer looks in pain he grimaces as they walk along
why rose daddy
nobody lives forever boy
whod want to
thats a hell of a thing to say
stops and firmly now look boy get a grip on yourself
rose had a good life
she found her
right didnt she
she triumphed over everything what are you blubbering about
im not blubbering
cut to a shot of the red ford going down the familiar driveway
in the car
daddy is staring fiercely ahead willcox hillyer stares ahead in gloom
as it pulls up in front of the holiday inn we have already seen
in the car
willcox hillyer sits there staring off into space in deep gloom
daddy eyes him and now relents
we see sympathy in his face
gently rose isnt dead son
some of us die but some of us dont
as long as some little girl somewhere gets herself up and goes out rose lives
cut to a shot of daddy and buddy now middle aged willcox hillyer as they walk toward the entrance of the holiday inn
