written by john j
mclaughlin based on the book alfred hitchcock and the making of psycho by stephen rebello we move across smoldering embers and reach a small grass fire
dirt is thrown over the flames before a boot finishes stamping them out
were just lucky it didnt reach the trees
we move up two dirty pairs of overalls to find henry and ed gein sweating away as they continue shovelling out the flames
both are in their forties and wearing flannel shirts
ed wears an elmer fudd hat
theres gonna be a lot more jobs at that factory by milwaukee come june
i could put in a word
you cant leave us henry
she needs both can you stop being a mommas boy for one second
henry looks at ed and he shrinks back
im not trying to hurt you but jesus you got to live your own life someday
that woman can take care of her own goddamn clang
henry is hit by the shovel in the back of the head and goes down
ed steps slowly forward and puts down the shovel
the look on his face isnt anger
he pulls at the flaps of his elmer fudd hat
then calmly walks away
the camera pans until we discover in his trademark black mariani suit
hes been watching the whole thing standing in the smouldering field only a few feet away holding a rose patterned cup and saucer of tea
he takes a sip and turns to address the camera good evening
he places his cup daintily back on the saucer
brother has been slaying brother since cain and abel yet even i did not see that coming
i was as blind sided as poor henry over there
he glances back over at the murder scene
apparently the authorities shared my naivete and believed the young mans tale that henry fell and hit his head on a stone and died of smoke asphyxiation
he shrugs who wouldve thought it
of course if they hadnt believed him ed never would have had the opportunity to commit the heinous acts for which he became famous
and we wouldnt have our little movie
instead wed have more nice safe predictable ones like these
from various technicolor films of the era peyton place with lana turner and betty field
pillow talk with doris day and rock hudson
a summer place with sandra dee mere technicolor baubles
he shudders with distaste
as if on cue the sky thunders loudly above him
he looks up and from behind the tree stump produces an umbrella
a bit of doom and gloom
now thats more like it
as hitch opens his brolly and the rain starts to bucket down equally torrential rain lit up by rotating kleig lights as they scan a marquee world premiere
north by northwest
directed by alfred hitchcock
jostling crowds run the length of the block
a pudgy hand discreetly squeezes a tiny delicate one
step out into a sea of flashbulbs
hitch basks in the limelight while alma his razor sharp charming wife of over years stands in the background uncomfortable with all the attention
hitchcocks agent lew wasserman dynamic charismatic comes into view
this thing is going to be gigantic
i wish i had twenty percent of the take
lew hustles them through the throng of reporters and photographers under their black umbrellas
does tonights incredible reaction surprise you mr
no when i was planning north by northwest i could already hear the screams and laughter
then to a beautiful any questions my dear
the blonde fan holding out her autograph book shakes her head no and giggles
the reporters crack up
alma manages a polite smile as lew helps her into the limo leaving hitchcock alone for a moment to sign his autograph for the blond fan
hitchcock youve directed forty six motion pictures
you host a hit tv show seen around the world
youre the most famous director in the history of the medium
but youre sixty years old
shouldnt you just quit while youre ahead
motionless and quietly devastated as flashbulbs crackle over his face
the whiteness transforms into
the gleaming white tiles of a bathroom
we move past chrome fixtures that evoke those in spellbound and psycho and arrive at that same pudgy hand pouring chateau cheval blanc into a cut crystal glass
soaks in the tub
the champagne glass beside him his corpulent frame is covered only by the london times hes reading
even in this deeply vulnerable state he maintains the air of a haughty mischievous emperor
at the sound of a bedroom bureau being opened hitchs eyes shift to the full length mirror on the bathroom door
we catch fleeting glimpses of alma in a white half slip and matching bra
she takes out some nylons and holds them up to the light
hitchcock watches enthralled
he puts down his glass and shifts a little in the tub causing the water to lap against the sides
alma pauses when she hears the small splashes
neither upset nor amused she continues about her business taking a skirt from the drawer
muhammad had the eyes of peeping toms gouged out with arrows
hitchcock clears his throat rattling his paper as if hed been reading the whole time
talking of arrows did you read mr
weilers review in the new york times
apparently he found the climax to be and i quote overdrawn
i doubt whether mr
weiler has had a climax in years
alma steps into her skirt as hitch opens the london times
and how about this little grenade
north by northwest reminds us of hitchcocks earlier more youthfully inventive spy thrillers
and just to drive the nail into the coffin theres a handy accompanying guide to the new masters of suspense
hitchcock zeroes in on the photographs
theyre all young
and with hair
why do they keep looking for new masters of suspense when they still have the original
dont be maudlin you know how much it aggravates me
he catches his reflection in the mirror again and sinks further down into the water to hide his protruding belly
alma comes in takes the newspapers from him and puts them on the side
stop reading them
youve been reading them for a week now
she puts down the toilet seat and sits on it
tell me dear
am i really too old
a true relic
and lest we forget a notably corpulent one
she comes over and kisses the top of his head
you always know precisely where to plunge the dagger dont you
right between the shoulder blades
i learned it from your pictures
she moves off to the mirror to apply lipstick and hitchcock surreptitiously picks up the papers again
where are you off to
im seeing whit for brunch after i drop you off at the studio
why dont you join us
weve just established that im too corpulent to be seen in broad daylight
youll feel better as soon as you find a project
hasnt peggy unearthed any decent books yet
sleeping pills with dust jackets
alma steps back to inspect herself in the full length mirror
todays outfit is we sense rather more stylish than what she would ordinarily wear
hitchs gaze never leaves the photo gallery of his younger rivals in the new masters of suspense article
as she elegantly masks her hurt
hurry up darling
hitch grumbles and tosses his paper aside
he rises from the depths but suddenly loses his balance and grabs onto the shower curtain wrenching it from the metal rings on the rod
a gods eye view looking down as hitchcock stares up at the metal rings spinning noisily on the metal rod
the famous mountain top icon looms large
two guards snap to for the arrival of hollywood royalty
alma waves from the wheel of a gleaming black cadillac
hitchcock sits next to her
he has his two sealyham terriers on his lap
he nods awaiting more
to the dogs sirs
the cadillac pulls up
alma notes hitchcocks look of frustrated envy as crew members bustle in and out of stage
its a hive of activity
theres a story out there waiting for you somewhere hitch
he gives her a good bye peck and opens the door
dont forget your lunch
alma hands him a compact fortnum mason basket and pats him on his girth
he opens it to discover celery and carrot sticks wrapped in saran
luxurious wood paneled and very british
hitch sits restlessly behind his desk receiving his morning shave from his private barber silvio
his longtime assistant peggy robertson s crisp british fiercely protective of her boss is going through a list of potential projects
fox is offering you the diary of anne frank for the third time
hitch directs his response to silvio
the audience would spend the entire picture waiting for miss frank to discover the corpse id hidden in the attic
wouldnt you agree silvio
hitch reaches for a carrot stick and crunches it
mgm wants you for the ian fleming book casino royale with cary grant
definitely your style
again turning to silvio doesnt she know i just made that movie
its called north by northwest
and style is merely self plagiarism
silvio nods then recommences the shave
im treading water peggy
i need something fresh
without expensive stars like cary grant or miss kim novak to pretty it up
silvio unintentionally nicks hitchs face
a nice clean nasty little piece of work
silvio hurriedly dabs away a speck of blood
ill see what i can find
hitch motions for the barber to hold up the mirror
the image of his face overflows the small frame
repulsed he leans back his head and makes a hand motion for silvio to slit his alma lunches with screenwriter novelist whitfield cook
whit s is hitchcocks physical opposite dashing razor sharp and sophisticated
in fact hed be at home in one of his movies
thank god i had a pocketful of pretzels
i was hiding in that props cupboard all night
thatll teach me to use a bedroom set instead of the real thing
serves you right
they laugh uproariously quite at ease with each other
hitch always said your private life was in danger of being more entertaining than any of your plots
he pours alma another glass of wine not remotely insulted
i cant believe he let me have you all to myself for a whole afternoon
especially looking this beautiful
he clinks her glass
alma turns to look at the menu again
all this relentless sycophancy is giving me indigestion
what are you after
he laughs his eyes straying to a pretty waitress passing by
and how is your wife
his eyes return to alma over the moon since i promised her the dedication in my new novel
so what are you working on these days
hitch is going out of his mind looking for his next project
you know how unbearable he is when he doesnt have something lined up
almost as unbearable as when he does
i meant you
what are you working on
im satisfied spending time in my garden
that is one lucky garden
whit brings out a set of galleys and slides them across the tablecloth to her
actually i was hoping you might be able to apply your considerable pruning skills to this
she looks down and reads the cover page
taxi to dubrovnik
by whitfield cook
all is finally revealed
he touches her hand affectionately
she brushes it away affectionately
the most fun i ever had was working with you
she looks through the opening pages
taking her time
enjoying making him wait
i suppose i could give it a look
hitchcock peeks avidly through the blinds at a smartly dressed kim novak type woman hurrying along to some appointment or assignation
hitch cranes to see who shes meeting but she moves tantalizingly out of sight
hitch turns back with a sigh towards his desk covered with discarded newspaper clippings and boring story proposals
he sweeps them off his desk into the trash
a shadow looms over peggy at her desk as she sifts through another round of story ideas
he startles her
anything at all
he starts sifting through her tray
she notices the glass in his hand
is that water or do i need to call alma
he drains it playfully
but somethings caught his eye
a circled review of anthony bouchers column criminal minds in the new york times review of books
he picks it up
boucher says this psycho book by robert bloch is fiendishly entertaining
it sounds ghastly
everyone in towns already passed
and who is everyone
the story department finished the coverage this morning
is this the one based on ed gein the serial killer
he takes the coverage and reads for himself
graphic elements of brutal violence voyeurism transvestitism and incest
certainly not your average run of the mill nutcase is he
he gives a grunt of approval
this is the boy who dug up his own mother
completely engrossed as he sits reading psycho in a chair by the fire of his elegant bel air home
he takes another gulp of wine when he hears alma enter and slides the wine glass out of view
alma pops her head in the door
she disappears to take off her coat
if youre good maybe you can have a grapefruit later
she comes back in again carrying some galleys notices the title of hitchs book some trash called psycho
whit gave me the galleys of his new book yesterday at lunch
ive already got some ideas on how you could adapt it
hitch continues reading
its elegant sophisticated full of the book or mr
she taps hitchs book dismissively with the galleys of taxi to dubrovnik
this might be the one alfred
he finally looks up
leave it on the night stand
as she leaves she points to hitchs hidden wine glass
there are calories in that you know
but hitch ignores her and turns to look out the window his imagination starting to turn
ed enters the bedroom
his mother augusta is in the bed faced away from him
arent you cold ma
she doesnt answer
we follow him to the dresser where he lingers a little too long over his mothers open underwear drawer before grabbing the blue coverlet on the side
he comes over and spreads the extra blanket over her
still wearing his jacket he takes off his shoes gets into bed and crawls up next to her
dont be afraid ma
as he puts his arm around her and pulls her close we reveal his mothers ghoulishly embalmed face
a slant of moonlight finds alma fast asleep until a finger nudges her awake
she lifts her satin sleep mask to see hitchcock holding out his copy of psycho
the look of obsession on his face is unmistakable
read the bit in the motel bathroom
he switches on the light by her bedside
she sits up puts on her glasses and reads from the opened page
mary started to scream and then the curtains parted further and a hand appeared holding a butchers knife
it was the knife that a moment later cut off her scream
and her head
handing him back the book charming
doris day should do it as a musical
she hands him back the book
this is nothing but low budget horror movie claptrap
she turns off the light again and goes back to bed
a deep voice sounds from the darkness
but what if someone really good made a horror movie
the hitchcocks eat breakfast on the terrace watching the gardeners trim the bushes and rake leaves from the pool
just think of the shock value
killing off your leading lady halfway through
alma can feel hitch looking at her waiting for a response
clearly he isnt going to let this one go
she butters her toast casually taunts him by adding a large spoon of marmalade
actually i think its a huge mistake
hitch falls silent a chastised schoolboy
you shouldnt wait till halfway through
kill her off after minutes
hitch enters with purpose carrying a stack of photos and articles
peggy i want you to summon your minions
and who might they be
hitch heads for his office in no mood for wise cracks
he spreads out the articles on the desk
photos and magazine articles about ed gein
get them started buying copies of psycho
peggy stands in the doorway watching how many do you need
all of them
i want every copy nationwide
have them scour every book shop and library
psycho is my next picture and i dont want anyone to find out the ending until they see it in the theater
peggy shakes her head
all that celerys affecting your brain
she walks over notices the life magazine headline house of horrors stuns nation
stark black and white photographs expose the nightmarish decay of the gein house
are you sure about this
this is so unlike you
thats exactly the point my dear
peggy watches uneasily as hitchcock pores over the articles with delight
a pianist plays a polite version of al jolsons my mammy
close on a manila envelope clutched in one hand behind hitchcocks back as we follow him travel through the party
the clink of champagne glasses as we reveal the guests saying hello as he passes
and when the wisconsin police department raided his farmhouse in plainview
is now in position in front of the fire place
around the coffee table are invited gossip columnists including a hedda hopper type
they take in the gory life magazine article
they opened the door only to discover voila
he produces the manila envelope from behind his back and empties the horrifically gory crime scene photographs inside onto the coffee table
ten female heads with the tops sawn off a dozen masks of human skin and a pair of lips on a drawstring for a window shade
hitch looks down sweetly at the circle of quietly horrified expressions
is this really going to be youre next picture mr
that is my intention madam
hitch taps the photo of ed gein
i only wish he looked more like william holden and less like elmer fudd
the other columnists scribble down the quote
am i the only one who finds this offensive
i was hoping everyone would
i mean life is deeply offensive and disgusting isnt it
hitch glides off without missing a beat past the servers arriving with more hors doeuvres from the kitchen
try the finger sandwiches theyre real fingers
he snags a martini and collars peggy while hes at it
im going to need some research detailing a typical unmarried year old secretary from phoenix arizona
he looks over at the pantry where alma can be glimpsed through the swinging door putting food onto trays
her monthly rent what she wears what she reads which scent or perfume she prefers
hitch sees whit lean into view and innocently whisper something into almas ear making her laugh
how she deals with a demanding boss when shes trying to relax on her weekends off
hitchcock doesnt notice the joke
he now only has eyes on the pantry ahead
he forges on through the guests only to get waylaid by lew
it is a classic hitchcock moment a character needing to get someplace being held up by someone who wants to chat re the faces of the i told you hitch
this things strictly for the drive in crowd
hitch smiles tightly and extricates himself heading on to the kitchen through more annoying guests whit leans against the stove watching alma expertly arrange the next round of hors doeuvres
coming in from the kitchen
now if this were a hitchcock picture what would two characters like us married to other people be saying
you dont have to pretend youre not upset he hasnt read it yet you know
im a big boy
i can take it
well i loved it
what terrific fun it must have been to research
certainly more fun than reading those reviews
do you think he really will read it
suddenly over whitfields shoulder alma sees hitch looming in the doorway
whit notes the tiny change in her eyes and turns
speak of the devil
hitch stares blankly at him while alma turns and busies herself over the sink hiding an almost imperceptible blush
i have to admit hitch i ran all over town looking for a copy of psycho but couldnt find a single one
i wonder how that could have happened
hitch sips his martini a picture of innocence
then leans in to whits ear and whispers just like whit leaned into almas ear a moment earlier
dont stop looking on my behalf
peggy appears in the pass through beckoning hitch to hurry back into the living room
hitch returns to see the other guests are now passing around the gein photos
they look utterly confused and horrified
a couple of them are even gathering their coats
standing together watching
ive seen happier faces on a school bus going over a cliff
i told you it would be too much
but they cant stop looking can they
he slurps his martini sharing a smile with lew
paramount president barney balaban s ferocious righteous sits behind his impressive desk flanked by two hitchcock and wasserman sit across from them
audiences want to be shocked barney
they want something different
and this is it
he gestures to the untouched copy of psycho in front of balaban
the truth is hitch every time you want to do something different like the wrong man or vertigo someone loses money
hitchcock stares unblinking giving nothing away
so we should stop trying to give them something new
you owe paramount one last picture hitch
cant you do something like north by northwest but for us this time instead of for mgm
hitchs stare remains inscrutable
weve offered you dozens of perfectly good properties
wasserman gives balaban the same glacial stare
the paramount executives shift uncomfortably
no one respects the name hitchcock more than paramount
but even a talented man sometimes backs the wrong horse
are you telling me no
balaban maintains a calm pleasant front
i think you know me better than that hitch
i would never say no to you
hitchs suppressed rage is building
but balaban says nothing
hitch and lew walk down the stairs and through the leafy courtyard past hitchs office
what a putz
you know what his family did before they built those movie palaces
ran a grocery store
my father ran a grocery store
thats what im saying
he should show some respect
hitch turns to lew
they think ive lost my touch lew
my association with television has cheapened me
are you referring to that deal i got you where bristol meyers pays you twenty nine grand an episode and you own the negative
thats my kind of cheap
they just want the same thing over and over
theyve put me in a coffin and now theyre nailing down the lid
lew puts a comforting hand on him
hitch i will never let that happen
hitch doesnt respond lew sensing the true depth of his friends melancholy
how much do you think you can make this picture for
eight hundred thousand
give or take
lew digests the figure
i have whisky in the car
alma does afternoon laps in the pool
a contemplative hitchcock wanders down to the pool side wearing black sunglasses and a business suit
he watches alma a moment
finally she notices him
youre back early
he shrugs then sits at the table to pour himself a glass of lemonade
alma gets out and towels herself off
im disappointed you didnt give whits book a chance
what about him
he knows you well enough
she sits down next to him noticing a tiny hole in her swimsuit
its starting to look a little threadbare
enjoy the pool now
we might not have it for that much longer
he looks off cryptically
paramount refuses to finance the movie
imagine the studio that brought you martin and lewis and the greatest show on earth considers psycho distasteful
he brushes some fallen leaves off his chair
lew cant find the money
not quickly enough at least
why not wait
he doesnt reply
she knows him well enough too and doesnt question him further
were going to have to go it alone old girl
well finance the movie ourselves
are we going to have to sell the entire house or just the pool
she looks at hitch but hes not joking
she turns to survey their beloved home and gardens
a long pause
tell me and i wont ever ask again
why this one hitch
its not just because so many people are telling you no is it
without turning he takes her hand
remember the fun we had when we started out and there was so little money and time
we took risks we experimented
we invented new ways of making pictures because we had to
a long moment as he gazes across the pool
i want to feel that kind of freedom again
he turns to look into her eyes for the first time
a glimpse of the real hitchcock
someone even his wife doesnt see that often
the famous gates and the executive building beyond it
barney were about to propose a restructured deal for psycho
balaban watches hitchcock and lew closely
hitchcock again is like a waxworks buddha revealing nothing
we finance it
paramount only distributes it
in exchange for percent of the profits
but tell us what exactly is paramount distributing
is this still a picture about a queer killing people in his mothers dress
what this picture is about is the reputation of alfred hitchcock
no ones arguing that
barney its very simple
this is mr
hitchcocks next film
are you in or are you out
a long silence
well obviously you have a lot of passion for this project
let me talk it over with a few people internally and ill get back to you
balaban takes in their inscrutable stares
not unimpressed by their chutzpah he leans back and puts his hands behind his head a king in his counting room
well take that deal
if you can get the money
finally hitchcock speaks up weve already got it barney
he pulls out his personal checkbook and opens it on the desk
barney watches as hitch takes the onyx fountain pen from its mount
who do i make it out to
hitch and alma lie side by side in their separate beds
a copy of the dance of death by strindberg lies on hitchs bedside table
all traces of his bravado are gone
if this picture fails alma well be in for a long humiliating bout of crow eating
the movie will be splendid
are you sure
of the movie
not in the least
but of you
pudgy fingers part the slats of the blind
hitch stares out hoping for some human moment to spy on
peggy ushers joseph stefano s into hitchs office
good to meet you
hitchcock leaves stefanos hand dangling in mid air and sits down at his desk
sorry i was late
my shrink session ran overtime
i see him every day and its still not enough
i thought only directors assistants needed psychiatrists not writers
stefano laughs off the barb and takes a seat as peggy slips out
the two men stare at each other but stefanos not remotely intimidated
do you see a shrink mr
hitchs eyes follow a plume of cigar smoke curling up to the ceiling
his gaze remains pointedly fixed on the ceiling
i must say it boggles the mind to imagine what you and your shrink could possibly talk about daily
the usual sex
hitchcock lowers his gaze suddenly intrigued
alma sits with the hitchcocks accountant whos consulting a ledger
she sits at her desk in the corner of the kitchen
theres still the federal income tax payments
the property taxes
not to mention the absence of any salary while hes actually making the film
stop waffling donald
give it to me straight
the accountant takes off his glasses plucking up the courage to look his favorite client in the eye
hitch wasnt exaggerating
if the films a flop youre going to have to sell the house
alma digests this
where do you suggest we cut
anywhere you can
almas moved to the kitchen table and is sorting through the accounts herself the dogs at her feet
her face is now properly filled with concern
hitch enters holding out some typed pages
alma covers her worry
he puts the pages on the table next to her
i got joe stefano to write out the first few scenes
why dont you take a look
alma takes stefanos pages and starts to read
hitch goes to the fridge and opens the door
were about to have dinner
you dont need anything else
he shuts the door
leans against the fridge door
hitch waits but she gives nothing away
until she off handedly places the pages on the table
she doesnt look up
close on a blank page being fed into a corona typewriter
fingers pound out psycho the door opens and hitchs step outside
the cadillac is waiting
alma follows him out and makes a final adjustment to his tie
the only thing worse than a visit to the dentist is one to the censor
whatever you do alfred dont lose your temper
the intimidating plaque for the mpaas production code administration office on the wall
stefanos title page is tapped angrily by geoffrey shurlock s the much feared administrator for the motion picture production code
he sits at the head of a big table with two assistants
sitting opposite are hitchcock peggy and several silent paramount executives
the code will absolutely not permit you to show a knife penetrating a womans flesh
i assure you geoffrey my murders are always models of taste and discretion
is there any improper suggestion of nudity in this murder scene in the shower
she wont be nude
shell be wearing a shower cap
shurlock makes a note
a man utterly devoid of any sense of humor
we might accept a shot from outside the bathroom window with marion in silhouette above the shoulders provided the glass is frosted
hitch greets the suggestion with barely concealed contempt
shurlock turns the page
then this scene with the toilet
its completely necessary
marion flushes evidence later found by her sister
its a clue to the girls disappearance
no american movie has ever found it necessary to show a toilet let alone to flush it
hitch turns to peggy and a paramount executive
perhaps we ought to shoot the film in france and use a bidet instead
no response from shurlocks end of the room
peggy stares down at the table
hitchcock if this office denies you a seal and were certainly heading in that direction your movie will not be released in a single theater in this country
will you be making jokes then
hitchcock gives a slow but meaningful shrug
now why dont we go all the way back to page two
boiling with rage as we hear the flurry of script pages sunlight filters through sheer curtains revealing hitchcock trying his best to recline on an analysts couch
everyone in hollywood resents me
i make them millions
and yet every year i sit at those dreadful award show dinners waiting for them to say just once youre good
he looks around the luxurious office
they take sadistic pleasure in denying me that one little moment
that must hurt
hitch fumbles for a handkerchief and mops his brow
youll have to excuse me doctor
im not used to this
take your time
now hitch claws at his tie
its hot in here
its just that more and more lately ive been having these
the analysts montblanc pen makes a note on a pad
we notice that his hands are surprisingly coarse
what kind of impulses
finally hitchcock is still
he stares up at the ceiling
a fridge door snaps open to reveal hitchcocks face in the darkness
hes in his pajamas
his hand trembles next to a stack of chicken breasts and moves to an upturned grapefruit half at the back of the shelf
he pulls it out it to reveal a hidden stash of foie gras under the hollowed out grapefruit
hes about to devour it when he catches sight of his distorted reflection in the chrome shelving
he backs away disgusted at this monster before him the light of the fridge illuminating his expression
a door is quietly shut and locked
the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet is inched open
a hand rummages deep inside and teases out a bulging manila folder
a hidden stash of some kind
the desk light is switched on revealing hitch
he carefully extracts the contents of the folder and lays them onto the desk
a personal collection lovingly kept
he settles in to study it picking out his favorites arranging them in order
theyre all in the same pose all with hair pinned up into a perfect bun
he looks at each image with intensifying desire
hes created all of them
but its no longer enough
a row of handsome actor headshots on a table
hitch glares at the waiting actors in the hallway through the blinds
he turns back to peggy and alma and pulls a face
send them all back to glendale
hitch returns to the table to ponder yet more headshots
peggy shares a glance with alma then slides over roddy the lazar office tells me hes crazy to work with you
well tell swifty he shouldnt have overexposed his client on television
unlike certain people we could mention
hitch ignores the barb
undeterred alma pushes her ace card a photo of anthony perkins radiating offbeat sensitivity and teen idol looks
think of the duality he could bring to norman
the rage lurking behind that little boy lost grin
the winsome charm he uses to keep from being found out
why alma youre not suggesting that mr
she raises her pinky finger just slightly
alma nods without judgement
anthony perkins now sits across from hitchcock
i cant count how many times ive seen strangers on a train and rope
well norman is the logical extension of the boys in those movies
appealing sensitive suffering the terrible burden of being forced to pretend to be something he is not
hitchcocks deeply felt remark lands with perkins
my only worry is that playing norman might cut too close to home
hitchs calmness is strangely reassuring to the young actor
i was incredibly close to my mother
so close i remember wishing my father would drop dead
and then when i was five he did just that
he keeled over from a heart attack
you see ive been guilty my whole life mr
hitch is enthralled
try to remember this is all just make believe
perkins wishes he could be more reassured
not to be prudish but how far do you plan to push normans relationship with his mother
further than you can possibly imagine
on perkins uncertain expression what is he letting himself in for
hitchcocks red sweating face as he grunts and heaves
hes dressed in gardening gear laboring in the full bloom of the rose garden
alma pushes a wheelbarrow filled with manure
she shovels the manure around the rosebushes
im getting blisters just looking at you
a bit of fresh air and exercise is exactly what you need
he holds his pruning shears menacingly over a deep red sydonie rose
if i could get grace kelly to play the girl theyd let me get away with anything
well you cant
shes a princess now which makes her permanently unattainable
hitchcock beheads the rose muttering to himself
and all the more desirable
his shears are now poised over a yellow specimen
lew suggested deborah kerr
hitchcock cuts it too and moves on to the stem of a perfect pink rose
what about janet leigh
shes always the good girl but she did awfully well in touch of evil
lew mentioned her name
do you remember how you always remarked on her figure at the wassermans parties
as the shears hover on the stem unsure whether to cut
the slender waist and ample bosom of janet leigh as she elegantly enters the dining room of chasens
hitch stands to greet her his eyes follow her across the room in some private rapture
alma watches as janet removes her glove and shakes hitchs hand
before he guides her to the spot to his left across from alma
hitch finishes telling his story
of course the real secret of mrs
simpsons appeal to the duke of windsor was that she could make a toothpick feel like a cigar
hes so deadpan
it takes a moment before she laughs
you know ive been so immersed in preparing to play marion id almost forgotten how to laugh
hitch summons the waiter with a snap
now you must try the banana shortcake
nothing for me thank you
im watching my figure
alma watches all this with a fixed smile
youre not the only one
to the waiter were fine thank you
hitchcock ignores alma gesturing to the waiter again
bring her the banana shortcake george
in fact make it two large portions
he pointedly shifts to face janet
so do tell me how else have youve prepared to play marion
ive written a complete history for her
it seems silly but it helps me
she turns to pull a leather notebook from her handbag hitchs gaze locks onto her silken blonde hair tied immaculately into the classic hitchcock bun
it doesnt sound silly at all
tell me one of her deepest secrets
a quick look to alma as if to ask for permission before she leads a double life
for instance when she works at the lowery office she wears tweed perfume
but when she and sam are together she recklessly breaks out her one expensive bottle my sin by lanvin
she notices almas expression
i do have a concern or two
im an actress but im also a wife and mother first so im wondering just how youll do that shower scene
you and the shurlock office
i mean even if you shoot me from here she indicates a spot just above her bosom well its not as if my figure is boyish
hitchcock looks down at her torso as if noting it for the first time
allow me to put your mind at rest
alma reacts as hitch reaches over and gives janets hand a reassuring squeeze
may i show you some of mr
saul basss marvellous story boards
hitch pulls out his folio case and shows janet the storyboards which we dont see
i plan to shoot quick bits of film from various angles
cut together this montage will suggest nudity and violence but nothing will actually be shown
janet studies them deeply impressed
and having you in the shower will make it all the more tit illating if youll excuse me
almas had enough
janets smile falters as she watches alma get up and head to the restroom
shes unsure of what just happened but hitch carries on regardless either entirely oblivious or not caring at all
alma enters and looks in the mirror quietly devastated
she looks up to find another reflection in a mirror behind her
alma is suddenly transformed into a technicolor hitchcock blonde
in a beautiful edith head gown her skin is velvet perfection her hair blonde and impeccable
oh come off it old girl
a bitchy studio heads wife snaps alma out of her reverie joining her at the sink to powder her face
alma dear how lovely to see you
youre looking a little pale
no wonder with that thing your husbands working on now
you cant possibly approve
shes had a drink too many but the throwaway comment still hits alma hard
why are you letting him do something so tasteless
dont upset yourself darling
its only a bloody movie
like in a douglas sirk movie
the same roses that are the color of janet leigh
alma hovers with her secateurs for a moment and then starts snipping off their heads with a caligula like lack of mercy
a vase of flowers none of them pink in the center of the table
hitch stares into a refrigerator filled with boring tasteless health conscious food
alma enters briskly and holds up a handwritten list
ive made a list of places where we can tighten our belt
she places the list on the table
it wouldnt hurt for us all to learn the art of self restraint
hitch goes over and picks it up and reads
the gardeners only once a week and weekends off for the driver
well find other places to cut
there arent any other places
and furthermore theyll be no more shipments from maxims either
we cant afford it
she snatches the list out of his hand
the foie gras at chasens is more than adequate
but those geese are from barstow not marseilles
she turns back to him
we all have to make our little sacrifices for the greater good dont we alfred
she leaves hitch to resume contemplating the contents of the fridge
but theres nothing there to satisfy his growling hunger
he slams the fridge and suddenly were moving through an empty living room prowling just like in a hitchcock movie as we hear clunking then move over to catch a
glimpse of ed as he drags a womans body feet first up the stairs
the clunking is from her head on the steps which is wrapped in her dress
ed approaches the shower curtain then yanks it open with a metallic screech
he pushes the body into the tub
pulls the dress off her head and drops it on the floor
im going to get the knives
we pan to reveal hitchcock standing in the corner
he looks terrified but completely enthralled he cant resist creeping forward for a thorough inspection
hitchs pov as he steps closer to the tub and glimpses the womans blood spattered white bra and girdle
suddenly fingers clutch the rim of the tub
hitch recoils but she lurches up and grabs his throat
hitchcock bolts upright in bed face beaded with sweat in the moonlight
it takes a moment to get his bearings
am i making a mistake
alma stirs in her bed
what if its another vertigo
oh shut up
just get the first take under your belt youll be fine
but hitch isnt looking convinced
a sign posted outside the soundstage reads production rehearsals
absolutely no visitors
it only makes passing reporters and workers more curious
inside its a hive of quiet purposeful activity
hilton green escorts vera miles across the far side of the stage
shes a classic blonde porcelain beauty in the grace kelly mold
i still cant believe you cast vera miles as the sister
hitch sits in his directors chair reading a copy of the london times
ive still got her under contract
i may as well get something out of it
rather a thankless role dont you think
for an utterly thankless girl
but he still watches vera over the top of his newspaper as the a
leads her through the maze of hazardous cables and light stands towards the fitting room
she passes an actor in a highway patrolmans uniform trying on various sunglasses with the prop master
shurlocks office called again
they want to know when youll be making the changes to the script
hitch gets up from his chair
the more we frustrate them the more their interest will wane
he goes over to specify the correct sunglasses that should be worn
the cop puts on the mirrored shades
hitch nods his approval
close on a rail of swimsuits
alma browses through them carefully
they are all perfectly nice if a little staid
her eyes suddenly catch a colorful swimsuit on the end of the rail
its striking even a little risque
she looks at the price tag
its insanely expensive
she turns to go
then impulsively turns back and grabs it heading into the changing room and closing the door behind her
light blasts through a tiny hole in the wall
an eye positions itself in front of the peephole
we hear the voices of two women quietly conversing on the other side
strains to get a better view
we catch teasing glimpses of golden girl vera miles stripping down to bra and panties
hitchcocks eyeball fills the frame as he peers through the tiny hole
we reveal vera with sharp bohemian costumer rita riggs who drapes taupe colored fabric to veras contours
break it to me gently
am i playing a lesbian librarian
re the fabric he chose it himself and had it imported from paris
vera laughs dryly at a wig on a dummy head
if i wear that im going to look like george washington
wait until you see the undergarments he picked out for you
vera tosses off her shirt
i just have to keep telling myself one more picture and im free as a bird
she unhooks her bra and crosses to hang it on a hook right near the hole where we just saw hitchcocks eye
his eye is gone only darkness from the other side
vera feels a chill and instinctively covers her breasts with her arm
is there a fan blowing somewhere
rita returns with a punitive bra and girdle
the old man really is unhappy with me isnt he
hitch knocks at the door
are you decent my dear
janet steps out dressed in a crisp sexy white shirt and pencil skirt
she does a twirl for him
the effect is stunning
even the stagehands stop to watch
am i alright
his picks a tiny piece of lint on her sleeve
as he escorts her onto the soundstage tony comes up to greet them
i want to thank you again for this opportunity mr
its just hitch tony
hold the cock
janet caught that shes clearly amused
tony gives her a gracious peck on the cheek
look at you two
americas favorite boy and girl nextdoor
janet flicks a glance back at hitch
and were about to move to a whole new neighborhood
already tony cant help feel a little excluded from hitch and janets little clique
hitch ushers them across the soundstage where the crew are assembling
vera miles marches up in her frumpy tweed suit and wig
thanks for the wardrobe hitch
already moving past her thats hand woven imported camel hair from rodier
dont you approve
youre the genius
she checkmates him with a ravishing smile
one thing though
my script is missing the last ten pages
until alma finishes the revisions
now hurry along vera
youre just in time for the oath
he steers her towards a line of laughing crew members forming a circle with the rest of the cast
he takes janet by the hand placing her right next to him and officiously raises his right hand
the cast and crew duly follow suit all except for vera
i solemnly promise
i solemnly promise
ignoring veras sarcasm that i will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of psycho
that i will not divulge the plot nor the many secrets of psycho
then tilt up to janets look of mock disapproval
vera pokes her tongue out
to friends relatives trade reporters or columnists not even to outgoing president dwight d
eisenhower god bless him
everyone cracks up but hitchcocks only interested in the reaction of his new blonde standing in pride of place right beside him
alma sits at the desk typing away at the revisions for psycho
we see the title page
a tiny solitary figure with nothing for company but a vase of wilting flowers
she pauses takes off her glasses and pushes aside her corrections suddenly fed up with the all the work
she looks out at the swimming pool sparkling in the sunlight
then turns to the expensive looking shopping bag half open on the side
we hear a loud splash as alma plunges into the water wearing her striking new swimsuit
she breaks into a front crawl
her strokes are vigorous surprisingly so
she drives the length of the pool her arms slashing through the water with increasing speed her feet kicking out with rising intensity
harder and harder
faster and faster
hitch guides janet and tony across the sound stage to the set of normans parlor
now hitch explain to me why im watching marion undress
i feel like i should take offense at that
she and tony laugh
hitchs eyes light up at this display of mischief from her
i dont know
perhaps as a boy norman secretly watched his mother preparing for her nightly bath
maybe there was a transom over the bathroom door
yes one he could access with a chair so long as he was stealthy
well a boys first glimpse of a naked woman is usually his mother
im reliving the past repeating a ritual with marion
youre the actor
you figure it out
tony flinches at hitchs brusque response
they arrive at the set wall where hitch removes a painting to reveal the peephole
hitch i have a question
why is the hole much larger on this side
all the better to see you at the greatest possible angle my dear
janet simply steps up and presses her face to the hole
hitch studies her profile quietly thrilled at her curiosity
tony hangs back watching hitch watching her
you really do your research dont you
its just my jesuit work ethic
he takes a quick peek through the hole now too
then puts the painting carefully back into place over it
the truth is
im only happy when im working
hitch lies on his analysts couch
and if im not working then im nothing
im not even a person
im just a collection of molecules
a useless cylinder of ugly flesh
the analyst circles one of his notes on a pad with his montblanc
again we notice how rough hewn his hands are
what about your mother
lets go back to her
hitch looks over at the unseen analyst and considers him
she was an extraordinary person
she exposed me to ibsen strindberg shaw
she hoped i would go into engineering carry a lunch pail gold watch at fifty
she didnt approve of your career
to her movie people were akin to thieves and prostitutes
he turns back to look out the window
if i misbehaved shed make me stand at the foot of her bed and discuss how i planned to become a better boy
the analyst leans forward and we see his dirty worn down fingernails
have you ever considered that your deep desire to gain the approval of your industry represents a textbook case of transference
the oscar is your mother
its ed gein
in his sunday best his shovel leaning against the mahogany paneled wall in the background
youre a fine one to talk
hitchcock leads janet to a row of brassieres all laid out for inspection
they are all white with recognizable labels berlei triumph marks spencer
he picks out one of them
you will be wearing a white bra like this for the opening scene on the bed
and then after youve stolen the money
they move on to a second row of brassieres all dark
i switch to one of these
he nods correct
she moves over to a mannequin displaying the iconic jet black brassiere
are you sure you dont want to look at something a little more elegant
they have to look like they were bought at sears and roebuck
i want every woman in the audience to look up at janet having sex with john gavin and think that could be me
janet reads the label
this is the brand i wear
hitch digests the information and turns to rita
were ready for a fitting
as rita starts to measure janets chest hitchcock lifts his hands and frames her
we travel across the rooftops of downtown phoenix and finally through the heat pick out a certain hotel window
close on hitchcocks framing hands as they now travel up to an open window with blinds half down
we go under the blinds and match dissolve into the room itself
hitchcocks hands have now become the camera recording the scene already underway and now watched by hitchcock his director of photography and crew from across the stage
we pan over and discover john and janet on the bed
the camera moves to janet and john making out on the bed
its serious stuff
shell be wearing only her undergarments and a large glow of satisfaction
janet smiles up at john contentedly
watching from his directing chair
peggy stands next to him
good luck getting this one past the censor
alma drives the gleaming black cadillac through the universal gates and pulls up to the production office outside the stage
alma collects the script pages off the front seat and walks into the production office just missing whit as he strolls back towards the writers building with a couple of
pretty whit pauses when he spots the hitchcocks cadillac
you girls go on ahead
the prettiest one stops to make whit light her cigarette before catching up with the others
peggy reads the final pages while alma inspects the production boards
if you ask me the credits should read screenplay by joseph stefano and alma reville
the people who matter know
thats all that counts
as she makes a few more changes to the schedule
alma turns to peggy whose face tightens as she continues reading
clearly its strong stuff
id hate to see shurlocks face when he reads this
she puts the pages down
alma you always know the answer
is this really going to work
a candid moment between the two women
but alma doesnt answer just leaves
alma emerges into the sunshine and looks across at the soundstage wondering whether she should go over there
she turns to see whit leaning against the cadillac
where have you been hiding yourself
ive been doing the revisions on
she points to the psycho house on the ridge
and how is the old boy
in a state of unbridled ecstacy now that hes back on the set
how are you
ive got eight hundred words to do for readers digest on what its like to be married to a man obsessed by murder
he looks at her a moment
ive got a better idea
he steps closer
why dont we drive out to santa barbara
well have emilio fry up those juicy steaks we like at el encanto
he playfully tugs at her sleeve
no silly magazine articles
just a wonderful meal
almas expression gives away nothing as we pan over to the window of the production office and notice the tell tale bend in the blinds
hitch looks out at whit and alma through the window just like he did with the other couple earlier
except this little interaction is far from dull
were ready for you on the set mr
ill be right there
but hitch doesnt move
alma enters the silent empty house smiling to herself
she walks through to and puts the grocery bags down on the counter
the house is eerily quiet until from behind was there a line at the market
alma looks up but doesnt turn round well used to hitchs cryptic ways
actually im back sooner than i expected
she puts on an apron and gets to work preparing dinner
would you like a cocktail
he heads for the liquor cabinet
he starts to head off and you shouldnt either
pulls out a celery stick from one of the bags and bites it
those havent been washed yet
i dont care
i was filming all day with john gavin a good looking chap but really plywood is more expressive
his love scene with janet may be most horrifying thing in the picture
he takes another bite searching her face for some tell tale sign of guilt
even your friend whitfield cook would be better in the scene
you should tell whit that
hed be flattered
she gets to work preparing a salad
hitch studies the back of her tiny vulnerable neck the delicate sinews and muscles as they rise and flex
hitch arranges his pillows and settles into bed while alma finishes getting ready
maybe i was too dismissive about your friend whitfields book
perhaps he and elizabeth could come over this weekend and he can walk me through it
almas radar activates but hitch continues oh so nonchalantly
lovely woman elizabeth
he carefully folds his blanket as if wrapping a murder victim
shes not exactly sure what hes implying but she knows she doesnt like it
i was hoping you could come by the set tomorrow
ill see how my day shapes up
she turns onto her side away from him
pulls the blankets around her her eyes still wide open
you think you can get away with it but you cant
almas eyes become hitchcocks eyes staring ahead intently
you think they cant tell
but they can
its all closing in on you
the noose is tightening
as he continues we pull back and see janet emotes for hitchcocks camera while driving a partial car being rocked by stage hands
peggy and other crew time and mark the takes
electricians and gaffers turn mounted lamps that rake across janets worried face like car headlights
you could return the money secretly but what would be the point
he wipes his brow getting more intense
you marion crane
the prim and proper girl whos always been so tight and respectable
so perfect and untouchable
well they know all about your dirty little secret dont they
your messy sticky lunchtime trysts
yes your boss mr
lowery could even smell the sex on suddenly the rear screen film breaks and a frame burns
its a good thing because janet is starting to look a little uncomfortable was that meant to be funny
as technicians yell and hustle hitchcock turns to peggy circle that
as janet gets changed vera hangs up her frumpy coat on a rack looking over a little enviously at janets good girl bad girl underwear hanging nearby
have you talked to him much about your personal life
id keep it that way if i were you
off janets look he starts by choosing your hairstyle and clothes and then he wants to choose your friends and decide how many children you should have
janet finds this a little hard to believe
vera leans in lowering her voice
that poor tortured soul jimmy stewart played in vertigo
thats hitch only younger slimmer and better looking
that may well be true but it doesnt bother janet
compared to orson welles hes a sweetheart
they both turn sensing something and see hitchcocks distinctive shadow profile in the hallway
the shadow lingers then recedes like in a scary ghost story
hes always watching
they laugh nervously
alma comes in from her gardening and settles on the sofa with a cup of tea a circled copy of tv guide next to her
on television the hitchcock classic stage fright
the credits come up screenplay by whitfield cook adaptation by alma reville
alma watches thrilled at the sight of her name and whits together
the words directed by alfred hitchcock overwhelm the small screen
alms puts down her fork no longer hungry
alma heads back to the kitchen only to pause at the open door to hitchs study theres something on the desk
hitchs personal collection
alma enters and starts to go through them
each photo is turned over a little more roughly than the last
its hard to tell whether shes more angry at the photos or the fact that theyve been deliberately left for her to find
alma takes off an earring picks up the phone and starts to dial
as the crew prepares the car set to go again hitch strides over to peggy whos dialing a phone
whats the hold up
its still engaged
he takes the phone himself just as vera miles emerges from her dressing room script in hand
hitch im stuck on lilas first scene
i dont know how strongly i should confront sam and the detective and i fake it
he turns his back on her and dials
the engaged tone blares in his ear
his eyes narrow at some crew members fussing with bits of light and sound equipment
does it really require two men to carry a light stand
ill take care of it right away mr
he rushes off to fix it
off peggys questioning look
its different when their pay is coming out of your own pocket
he raps the receiver button more intensely this time and redials
but almas still on the phone to whit basking in his charm
her feet are up
theres a drink in her hand
well i think that sounds like a fabulous idea
well have a late lunch
ill make the reservation for one thirty
what would i do without you
till then bye
she hangs up toying with her earring feeling better already when the phone rings again very quickly
she picks up without even thinking what did you forget now
pudgy fingers clench the coiled phone cord as we move up to hitchs face
hes silent as a burglar not even daring to breathe
is that you
the blood drains from hitchs face as he very slowly and carefully replaces the receiver
his mind starts to spin
hes got to get out of there
hitch lurches towards the production office starting to sweat but his path is blocked by grips laying cables
the set is suddenly a cacophony of noise and chaos
a pr flack appears mr
hitchcock every press outlet is driving us crazy for photos hitch brushes past him to find another route but more grips are moving a ladder
he turns kicks a platter of healthy snacks out of the way only for an arclight to swivel in his face and blind him
are you okay
youve gone very pale
peggys face suddenly comes into focus
stop trailing me like a puppy dog and get me something long cool and wet
its not even three
give me the key
he snatches it and pushes past her leaving her flat
hitch exits the soundstage doors only to find the humorless face of barney balaban blocking his office door
hows the picture
im hearing interesting things
its a wonder you can hear anything over the noise coming from the shurlock office
balaban offers up his handkerchief
hitchcock waves it away even though hes now covered in sweat
i shouldnt be in a position of just hearing things hitch
its time you showed me some footage
to see if youre making a picture paramount can actually release
as you well know barney my contract guarantees me final cut
your contract also says paramount isnt required to distribute any film that could cause us embarrassment
unlike the last five martin and lewis pictures youre all so proud of
he slams the door in balabans startled face
hitchcock loosens his collar and catches a glimpse of himself in a mirror
hes unraveling and it shows
i demand to see some footage hitch
hitch lowers the window blinds over balabans face and fumbles for the phone
connect me to maxims of paris
he takes the key and opens the liquor cabinet ignoring the insistent knocking at the door yes its alfred hitchcock in hollywood california jean claude
i need three pounds of foie gras sent on the next flight out
he pours himself five fingers of scotch
a majestic view of the coastline as whitfield cooks cream mercedes cl zooms along top down
alma wears white rimmed sunglasses and a head scarf
whitfield in true hitchcock leading man style has the perfect amount of wind blowing through his hair
those steaks havent changed at all have they
its so nice not to have to take care of someone even if its just for an hour or two
she takes in the sparkling scenery whipping past
whit where are we going
you still havent told me
i have a little surprise
whit just smiles as he jams the acceleration and the car roars off down the highway
hitch stands in the parking lot tapping his foot impatiently near the parked ford fairlaine police car used in psycho
janet watches him sitting behind the wheel of her volkswagen beetle
after a moment she toots her horn and drives up
what happened to your driver
ive been asking myself the same thing
i can give you a ride if you want
hitchcock raises an eyebrow at the tiny car and then with great effort inches his massive frame through the open door
did you know adolf hitler sketched the design for this car on ferdinand porsches cocktail napkin in a berlin beer garden
she turns to see hitch wedged uncomfortably into his seat
its only now that i truly appreciate just how diabolical herr hitler was
she notices him eyeing the half eaten bag of candy corn on the dashboard the kind norman bates enjoys throughout psycho
letting him in on it i pinched them from tonys dressing room
he takes one and chews it curiously
so this is what they eat at the drive ins
he takes the whole bag and sets to work popping them in one after the other
i thought you only ate fauchon chocolate
needs must when the devil drives my dear
hes so deadpan but now theres no way to tell if hes joking or not
she puts the car into gear sensing his despair
nesting in the sand
alma and whit sit out watching the surf
the water laps over their toes
i dont mind that he uses his obsession to fuel his art
i just dont like it when he uses it against me
hes like any great artist
impossible to live with but worth the effort
he throws a rock into the van gogh wasnt exactly a walk in the park either
did you know when we started out i was his boss
he didnt even dare ask me out until hed worked his way up to assistant director
whit watches as she picks up some sand lets it run through her fingers
what do you think of that place over there
he nods to a small beach house up the way
she looks at him askance
is he joking
i just saw elizabeth
why on earth didnt she tell me
she doesnt know about it
the sun is setting on the hitchcocks driveway
the vw pulls to a stop in front of the front door
janet looks over decides to risk it
so what did happen between you and vera
i was going to make her star
but she chose the life of a housewife
he stops chewing
we push in as his features turn reflective
i cast her as the lead in vertigo
then two weeks before filming she told me was pregnant
he screws up the empty bag of candy and looks over at janet
then almost like a child why do they do it
why do they always betray me
as she looks across and sees the lonely abandoned little boy just sitting there
alma enters the beach house cautiously and looks around
it is old and falling apart with only a few functional furnishings
im just leasing it for the offseason
a place to get away from the wife and kid and write
you might find that room interesting
the door is partially open she sees the one conspicuously new item of furniture
a double bed
i hope you havent got the wrong idea
he gives her a rakish grin then pushes the door open further to reveal the deck beyond
sit on a table facing each other
if you were serious about helping me adapt my book i thought it would be the perfect hideaway
she lets this sink in entranced by the incredible view and the crashing surf
then she steps out onto the deck and up to one of the typewriters
gives the key an approving tap
hitch enters the empty house at dusk
the dogs greet him
he listens a moment
then walks through to the study
hitch pours himself a brandy and downs it in one
he goes to pour himself a second when he notices something on the desk
its his collection of photos by the telephone
theyre all neatly stacked
with a single gold earring on top
hitch lies in bed his thoughts racing as he waits for alma to come home
finally the sound of the car comes up the driveway
he turns onto his side and pulls up the blankets listening to the sound of the front door
and almas footsteps down the hall
she quietly slips into the bathroom and shuts the door before turning the light on
he watches her shadow through the strip of light at the bottom of door
when the bathroom light switches off again hitch hurriedly closes his eyes
alma emerges in her nightgown and stops at his bedside peering down on him
shes not completely sure that hes actually awake but she suspects
hitch eases himself up and looms over alma to make sure she is safely asleep
he silently picks up her handbag and takes it to the window
using the moonlight he searches its contents
and the first few pages of a story outline the pages vibrate in his hand as his gaze lowers to reveal the rest of the title page story treatment by
whitfield a glistening mound of foie gras spooned into hitchcocks mouth straight from the maxims of paris tin
hitch stands in the glare of the open fridge a beast feeding in its cave shoving in mouthful after mouthful
its almost pornographic in its indulgence
gein steps out of the shadows and puts a comforting hand on hitchs shoulder
we hear the civilized clink of cutlery against china
hitch and alma sit at the table having lunch
alma eats a pork chop while hitch defiantly nibbles at his healthy salad
he has a nice big glass of red wine which alma ignores
so i read your finished treatment
taxi to where was it
care to hear my opinion
theres no other way of saying it
dead in the water
alma blinks unable to hide her shock
with mock compassion the plots a muddle
some of the jokes are awfully like things we already did better hundreds of years ago in the lady vanishes
and your villain is weak
but the biggest failure is the relationship between the hero and heroine
he picks up a radish and bites into it
if you werent so smitten with your friend whitfield cook youd probably see that
alma is entirely stunned
hitchcock has delivered the killer blow he intended
he gets up and goes over to the garden door
women never really care to face the truth when their hearts are involved do they
as he steps out into the garden how would you know what really goes on between a man and a woman
hitch searches his pockets for his lighter but cant find it
his annoyance only increases when he notices the scattered leaves contaminating the surface of the pool
look at this mess
he grabs the net and starts scooping them out
bloody belt tightening
he cant get the net into the inflow filter so he gets down on his hands and knees and starts pulling out the leaves with his hands
watches from the window
then turns away
pulls out handful after handful of wet leaves clawing away at them like a madman
stage hands and engineers test a row of hot water tanks installed on the set
we follow the sound of rushing water through a pipe as it snakes across the set floor and passes through a fake wall to unleashing a stream of steaming hot
the set hand gives the thumbs up
tell the boss were ready
peggy and a
hilton green exchange a glance as hitchcock paces up and down in the corridor eager to get to work
whats the hold up
call time was two hours ago
peggy nervously knocks on janets door and peers inside rita riggs is hard at work molding moleskin patches to janets nipples
and youre sure this moleskin will stay put
neither woman looks convinced but they proceed with blind faith
im going to be taking a shower all week
as janet slips on her robe a moleskin triangle plops onto the floor
rita and janet share a worried look
alma sits at her typewriter while whit stares off looking a little uncertain
forget what hitch said
hes just feeling his age
hell come around
but hes right
it does need more feeling
alma ponders the problem
finally so why dont we put some in
she gets to her feet and starts to pace
all we need is a better catalyst
some innocuous little trigger to release all that underlying desire
the soothing sound of the ocean gives way to the relentless hiss of shower water janet nervously removes her bathrobe and heads toward the good morning
he takes her hand and guides her into position
as i explained earlier this scene will be made up of many shots from mr
a series of looks actions
well youre the professional
youll know how to do it
around them the crew frantically finalize the camera and light setups
male crew members look uncomfortable and excited by the unprecedented sight of a virtually nude movie star
saul bass comes over with his boards and hitch and he discuss the planned shot a moment
tonys stunt double is ready
theres our murderess
into frame steps anthony perkins female stunt double margo wearing a gingham dress silver wig and black makeup to mask her face
she wields a large prop knife and almost blocks our view of janet in the white tiled stall
are you ready for our little bloodbath
my mother always said have confidence in yourself and you can lick anything
hitchcock takes janets hand and with tremendous sincerity my mother used to say the same thing
lets go for a take
over and over margo attacks with the knife and janet tries deflecting the blows but both women are timid and janet is clearly guarding her modesty and covering her body
lets go again
margos knife comes at janet uncertainly and every which way
naked and exposed janet defends against the knife blows as they come at her but margos still pulling her punches no
you are possessed with unbridled homicidal rage
he charges over to margo to demonstrate the savage stabbing gesture he demands
does no one understand what im trying to accomplish here
im older than anyone on this stage and im still standing
everyone falls silent unsure how to respond
hitchcock holds give me the knife
margo places the knife in hitchcocks palm
bring in more blood
a female makeup assistant squirts more chocolate syrup blood onto janet from a plastic bottle of bosco
as the scene is marked we see hitchcocks anxiety
there is no sound except hitchcocks ragged breathing
the camera whirs
hitchcock hoists the knife into the air with terrifyingly convincing power and malevolence
we see in the shower from hitchcocks pov not janet but geoffrey shurlock
hitchcock slashes the censor a killer blow that sends him reeling
shurlock is replaced by barney balaban
hitchcock stabs him with unleashed fury and hate
whit turns hes naked and smiling
hitch plunges the knife into his back and he drops revealing alma arms around his waist
were back in the real moment janet leigh screaming as she gives the performance of a lifetime
hitchcock stops stabbing
his heart pounds
hes soaked with sweat
the only sound is the drip drip drip of the shower
as he realizes everyone is staring at him
he straightens his tie attempting to regain some semblance of control
weve got it
he exits quickly
rita escorts the shaken and exhausted janet off set passing vera whos witnessed the whole thing
shes wearing a bathrobe
janet gives her a look as if to say now i understand
hitch shuts his office door and leans back against it
he closes his eyes nauseated and dizzy
he doesnt even need to open them to know whos there waiting for him
not now ed
its really not a good time
he staggers towards the water cooler fumbling for a cup
ed steps forward and pours him some water pats his shoulder
you just cant keep this stuff bottled up
but before hitch can drink it he crashes to the floor
peggy and perkins to react to the noise
they come through the door to see hitch lying on the floor
he looks like hes dead
peggy rushes forward to help
perkins just stands and stares as if paralysed in some freudian nightmare
starts to ring
it is inside the beach house and partially drowned out by the sound of the crashing waves
alma and whit are on the deck acting out the scene as they write too engrossed to notice
what if helen and michael try and get into the cab at the same time
even better what if they reached for the cab door at exactly the same time
alma demonstrates so that their hands touch
that way we could start close on the hands
tracking the movement and then tilt up to the eyes
they stare into each others eyes lips just inches apart
that feels better already
finally the phone intrudes
are you going to get that
with some effort whit goes inside and picks it up
he comes outside holding out the receiver for alma
its for you
peggy grips the phone her face full of concern
i know you told me only to call in an emergency but im not sure how else to describe this
hitch lies slumped on the floor
a compress over his forehead
his head lolls to one side as he slips in and out of consciousness
disarray on the set
martin balsam watches as saul bass cameraman jack russell and a
hilton green argue about the best way to proceed with the staircase sequence
hitch is conspicuous by his absence
as they bicker we find tony perkins off to one side sitting in his mrs
bates costume unable to cope
he puts the wig back on his head
there that feels better
balsams finally had it with all the arguing
he walks off past peggy whos arriving with the phone
the inmates are running the asylum
peggy hands hilton the phone
i have mr
hitchcock for you
she gives him a warning look
hes in a terrible mood
he waves away her concern
it cant be that bad
hey there hitch
were still working on it
looking over at the everyone misses you
hitch in bed and sick as a dog has the script notes and boards on a bed tray
the phone receiver is pressed to his ears
ive told peggy and now im going to tell you
you have to get this sequence shot today
whats the hold up
we tried it ten different ways and it looks terrible
why dont we use inserts
it has to be a high angle
youll tip off the big surprise
just get the process shot
hitch slams down the phone
still clutching the phone a little nonplussed
peggy gives him a look what did i tell you
alma removes the phone from hitchs grasp
touches his forehead
no more phone calls
youre burning up
burning up our money
were two days behind and im stuck in bed
hitch swings his legs out of the bed
where do you think youre going
to the set
we cant afford to lose any more time
two more days of this and the whole production goes under
he shakily tries to get to his feet
you stay in bed
ill deal with it
id hate to take you away from your writing partner
she pushes him back against the pillows
hes too weak to resist
under the blankets
crew members sit around eating donuts
assistant director hilton green and cameraman jack russell are still arguing over the mechanics of the shot with more crew members joining in
its near pandemonium
then alma steps in the door and everything stops
every crew member snaps to attention as alma passes by
its like the school principal arriving after the substitute teacher has lost control
dont stop work because of me
im only here as one of the two people paying your salaries
alma takes a seat in hitchs directors chair
as her eyes dart around the set its clear that she is taking everything in
peggy flanks her
one seventy three
peggy hands the boards to alma
she and hilton quickly review the boards
start with the overhead
well cut before the fall
then well put martin in a chair under the camera
hilton looks at russell
he sets anthony perkins in his dress into place
to the cameraman and that lens should be a thirty five
peggy mouths alma a silent thank you for restoring order
hitchcock lies in bed tossing and turning the fever only making his thoughts darker and more obsessive
you forgot to look in the bathroom
hitch notices the shadowy figure standing at the end of his bed
a man like you
missing the vital clue like that
he blearily sits up and sees geins impassive rustic face
what do you mean
gein steps over to the bathroom and pushes open the door
my mother always said if youre going to do a job do it right
hitchcock enters the immaculate white and chrome room and inspects it
but nothing seems out of place
check the floor
he looks down but again nothing
hitch gets down on his hands and knees
he runs his fingertips across the smooth white tiles
they start to sprinkled all over the floor
you still think theyre just writing together
hitchcocks face hardens
his lip trembles
so what are you going to do about it
hitch gets up opens the medicine cabinet and takes out a he empties the tablets into the sink and very carefully sweeps the sand into the aspirin bottle
he caps it slips it into his robe pocket and turns off the light
alma spots the towering figure of balaban stride onto the stage accompanied by a man in a cardigan
he sees her and bristles clearly surprised to see her there
alma takes in balabans companion and the viewfinder round his neck
you know david kirkpatrick
hes working on jerry lewis next picture
they nod politely then stand there
so hes free to help
a sly smile if you need it
just the bustle of crew members in the background
that wont be necessary
but youre nearly three days behind
he takes a step towards hitchs empty chair but alma moves to block his path
it may be a small gesture but its highly charged
barney stares down at her
we both know what kind of film this is
then closer the smart thing to do would be to help hitch finish it
thank you for your concern barney
she moves closer to him holding his gaze not bending one bit
but on a hitchcock picture there is only one director
the anger flashes on his face as she faces him down the entire crew behind her now holding firm
balaban incensed leaves the stage with kirkpatrick
alma steps out into the sunlight not far behind them
as she watches them leave she lets out a breath
a voice calls out to her mrs
she turns to see janet walking over in capri pants and a sleeveless top
shes carrying an elegantly wrapped package
i hope you dont mind
i heard hitch was sick so i got him a little something
she hands alma the gift
a bag of candy corn tied with a ribbon
thats kind of you
well hes been very considerate with me
i havent always had that from my directors
janet youve been very
it hasnt gone unappreciated
alma takes in janets unaffected natural beauty and her sincerity
she cant help but notice the second glances janet is provoking from passers by now
shes an impossible rival for any woman
on the stereo
alma finds hitch on the sofa swaddled in a blanket and eating ice cream
may i turn that down
she silences the stereo
hitch doesnt react
youll be pleased to know order has been restored
he still doesnt look at her masticating loudly
a thank you would be nice
were still two days behind and sixty thousand over budget
i already cancelled the wrap party
thatll save us two thousand right there
and you wont be tempted by any champagne and cake
she pulls at the bowl of ice cream
he refuses to let go
beware all men are potential murderers
she yanks it from his grip
with good reason
alright whats this about
he slowly pulls the aspirin bottle from his robe pocket building suspense as he unscrews the lid and pours sand into a tiny pile on the coffee table in front
spending a lot of time at the beach
he puts down the bottle looking for a reaction
thats where whit and i are writing
hes rented a place
hardly the ideal setting to avoid distractions
actually its very conducive to creative collaboration
i already told you that treatment is a waste of time
didnt everyone say the same thing about psycho
she reaches for the aspirin bottle to throw it away but hitch grabs it first are you and whit having an affair
dont be absurd
hes working on something new and needs a little help thats all
what a coincidence
im working on something new and i could use a little help too
what do you think ive been doing
then why are you spending all hours of the day and night with some overage talentless mammas boy
because its fun
he quivers livid
i am under extraordinary pressures on this picture the least you can do is give me your full support
weve mortgaged our house
almas eyes flash with unaccustomed hurt and fury
might i remind you that i have weighed in on every aspect of this film so far as i have done on every picture youve done in the last three
and the first time you show the film it will be my notes that you want
i celebrate with you if the reviews are good and i cry for you if they are not
i host your parties and put up with those fantasy romances with your leading ladies
and when youre out promoting this film around the world i will stand beside or rather slightly behind you smiling endlessly for the press even when im ready to drop
being gracious to people who look through me as if i were invisible because all they can see is the grand and glorious alfred hitchcock
hitchcock is stunned and silent
now for the first time in years i dare to work on something that isnt an alfred hitchcock production and im met with accusation and criticisms
this work im doing with whit gives me pleasure and purpose
and even though that takes absolutely nothing away from you please consider this a reminder i am your wife alma reville not one of the contract blondes you badger and
torment with your oh so specific direction
she turns and with great dignity leaves hitchcock sitting in the gathering gloom
hes not the only one who can deliver a killer blow
with that same lost expression on his face only now dark shadow and harsh light alternate across his features
a naked light bulb dangles from the ceiling as stage hands prepare the films climactic scene in the cellar
hitch watches as vera reaches out to touch the shoulder of mrs
we zoom in on her as she reacts in silent horror her hand flying up to hit the light bulb throwing crazy shadows all over the set
we push in on hitchcocks face as the strobing light briefly illuminates the image of at the foot of his mothers bed
a wig on a stand
a frumpy womans outfit on a hangar
vera sits in front of the mirror and unties her own hair
free at last
rita collects veras detested wardrobe to take back to wardrobe
vera rubs cold cream into her face to remove her make up
in the mirror she sees hitch in the doorway as rita squeezes past him on her way out
wiping off her make up with a kleenex hello hitch
you always make it look so easy
oh it was nothing hitch
i just faked it
she gives him a dazzlingly ambiguous miss america smile
well i guess this is au revoir
hitch comes and stands behind her chair gazing at her in the mirror
why didnt you stay with me
i would have made you as big a star as grace kelly
she considers the question and the man asking it sensing something different about him now
she continues wiping off her make up
unlike grace kelly i can pick up my dry cleaning
ive got a family hitch
that will always mean more to me than all of this
that blonde woman of mystery youre after
shes a fantasy
she doesnt exist
he studies her a moment
there was a time when i thought i understood you so completely understood women
hitch gives a very slight bow touches her on the shoulder then leaves
vera watches him go struck by his rare show of vulnerability
wind blows sand off the dunes
alma sits in the parked car outside the beach house contemplating the typed pages on the seat next to her
an inkling that they may not be as magical as she had hoped
she checks her reflection in the rearview and applies some lipstick readying herself
she collects the pages and heads up the steps to the deck
she sees two typewriters and paper but no sign of whit
something doesnt feel right
she turns and in the bedroom through the window she sees whitfield cook making love to a young woman it is the pretty secretary from the studio lot
alma and whits eyes meet
whit is horrified at being caught
alma ducks her head wheels around in shock
she yanks open the door and gets in
whit runs half dressed from the house
alma i thought you were coming later tonight
i thought you rented this place so we could write
i swear this just happened
she struggles to get the key in the ignition
he puts his hand desperately on the car door
you wont say anything will you
i wont tell elizabeth
i mean to hitch
whit smiles feebly
we cant all be geniuses
alma tries to hide what a body blow this is
alma youre incredibly talented
but after all
we want him to read the script with an open mind
oh i wouldnt worry about that whit
she starts the car and drives off
whit watches deflated knowing hes ruined everything his receding figure swallowed up by flickering white light
lew sits with barney balaban and two executives
lew discreetly checks his watch out of boredom
shurlock and his two assistants look appalled
composer bernard herrmann late s prickly sits in the back row looking suicidal
he glances back at hitchcock who stands near the screening room door looking worse if that could be possible
shurlock exits and approaches hitchcock whos waiting in the foyer
youre going to have to cut all that nudity
it was suggested
i definitely saw that knife jabbing her
we did no such shot
id stake my reputation on it
im recommending you cut the shower scene entirely
hitchcock is livid but holds his tongue
ill go over it frame by frame and set up another screening
but shurlock is already walking away
wasserman emerges from the screening room conversing with balaban
hitch searches their expressions for some indication but balaban strides off without saying a single word to him
whats the verdict
lets just say it was a four letter review and it wasnt good
the harsh reality devastates hitchcock
its too late for paramount to back out no matter what balaban says
hitch just stands there
the other route is to recut it as a two parter for the tv series
because of the budget and the hitchcock name we stand a good chance of breaking even
still hitch doesnt say a word
look i made jimmy stewart a millionaire of winchester and that was a dog
at least i could sit through your picture
hitch stares bleakly off
he cant help noticing the kim novak type he spied on earlier outside hand in hand and kissing her date
more importantly what does alma think
alma sits with the hitchcocks accountant going over the books again looking at the revised figures
they close the books and sit back and look at each other
is there anything else we can do
this time he cant bring himself to look her in the eye
well just have to wait and see how the movie turns out
alma gets up and crosses to the window
stares out at the pool reflecting a leaden sky
and the clumps of dead leaves floating across its surface
well it is only a house
the dogs geoffrey and stanley lap away at a water bowl in the study
a splash or two of something is added to the bowl from above
its being poured from hitchs brandy glass
pours himself another glass leaving the dogs lapping happily away as he goes over to the steinway grand
theres a bank of silver framed photos on top
he pauses to take a proper look at them
his and almas life together in movies
smiling at premieres with cary grant and grace kelly
on vacation with jimmy and gloria stewart
at a black tie event with ingrid bergman and gregory peck
but its the photograph tucked away at the back that he wants to see most
a black and white publicity still taken on the set of the mountain eagle in
he picks it up and looks at it the young hitchcock in front of the camera dramatically calling action
on his first film
his eyes dont have to move far to find alma standing just behind him making notes on her clipboard the same intense serious look on her face
they look so young
hitch turns to look out the window thoughtful hitchs pov
its snowing outside
we pull back to discover the window is now in a basement lit by a single oil lamp
we find gein sitting at his workbench
hitchcock is perched on a stool nearby watching him
trash and newspapers are piled everywhere
there is grime and dark stains on the cabinets and counters
this is my favorite place
i just shut the doors and leave the world behind
hitch watches gein as he threads a needle stitching something expertly together
he notices theres no hint of a tremble in geins hands
pass me that bag will you
hitch passes over the shopping bag
then pulls up his coat feeling a chill
dont you get lonely out here sometimes
i can always talk to my mother
as we hear cars pull up a lot of them
the sound of men shouting
flashing red and blue lights
loud knocking at the thats strange
footsteps thunder above him
dozens of officers are fanning out all over the house
hitch watches as gein just sits there and the sound of shocked reactions and horrified gasps continue above
i think we found his hiding spot
they cant go in there
thats my mothers room
car headlights blast through the window and hitchcock finally sees the basement room properly for the first time knives of all shapes and sizes
jars of preserved body parts
and two from upstairs the sound of splintering wood
they cant go in there
thats my mothers room
ed springs to his feet screaming it out as he bolts upstairs and the pandemonium continues o
as the bleak reality of geins lair hits him
its more profound and horrible than he could ever have imagined
a lush romantic score starts to swell mercifully drowning it all out
titles from a dark romantic melodrama fill the screen
alma sits watching the afternoon movie alone brushing the dogs on the sofa next to her
hitchcock reads almas fragile emotional state and enters
he sits down beside her and studies the screen for a moment
an odd little movie
of course colbert is wonderful
they watch for a beat longer
how was the beach
cold and miserable
just like barney balabans face
he indicates the over ripe dialogue coming from the tv
whit isnt worth a damn when hes not working with you
and neither am i
alma takes in his reflective expression but says nothing
i didnt pull off the picture this time
it just sits there refusing to come to life
theres no other way to say it
alma turns away
hitch sits there bereft in the lonely silence
i let you down my love
he moves closer and takes her hand
gives it a small squeeze
you deserved better
she still doesnt move
after a moment hitch gets to his feet
ill go and feed geoffrey and stanley shall i
he exits with the dogs padding after him
she turns back to the screen and more of that stilted mannered dialogue
tears well in her eyes
a full moon
the only light from inside the house is the one in the kitchen
we glimpse the figure in the window
a corpulent man in profile like a hopper painting
hitch sits in his nightgown pushing some vegetables around his plate his healthy midnight snack
alma enters in her robe
hitch watches her
she goes to the fridge opens the produce drawer and from under the brussel sprouts pulls out a tiny hidden jar of beluga caviar
she gets the crackers a plate and a spoon and sits down at the table next to him
i dont think i can stand both of us being maudlin
she fixes several crackers each with an appropriate dollop of caviar on top and puts the plate in the middle
there is one solution to all this you know
she offers him one of the crackers
we could both get to work together
tentatively hitch accepts it
that tiresome little hitchcock imitation ive been helping whit finish is done
hitch remains quiet delicately consuming his cracker
so i suggest for everyones sake we start whipping psycho into shape tomorrow
you may not be the easiest man to live with but you know how to cut a picture better than anyone
hitch puts the lid back on the caviar
except for you
a series of quick shots as the editing room comes to life hitch and editor george tomasini wait quietly like schoolboys while alma reviews the footage on the moviola
youll need to cut those six or seven frames where she blinks after shes supposed to be dead
weve seen the footage a thousand times
she doesnt blink
alma gives him a look
four assistants are working on moviolas
alma and hitch work their way down the line inspecting each new assembly
take thirty frames off the head
no no the second take the light is better on his hands
only cut back to janet once the cars already moving
cut it tighter
the minute i lose one person ive lost the whole audience
two pairs of hands
hitchcocks and almas
they work like a pair of twenty year olds at a pair of moviolas cutting the picture
angle loosens to reveal george tomasini has dozed off exhausted
you got nudity in there
her breasts are very large dear
it was a challenge not to show them
editor george tomasini works at the moviola sleeves rolled up
ill be damned
she did blink
peggy stands with a pestering pr flack
hows it going in there with mr
everyones saying its a dog with fleas
before peggy can deny it the argument flares through the wall
bernard herrmann is pressing his point hard with hitchcock
i dont want music in the shower murder
but what alma and i talked about is really going to play
this isnt vertigo bernie
this is different
the images have to work on their own
you cant scare people just by going boo
you have to tell them whats coming make them anticipate it the pr flack shares a despairing look with peggy
thank god weve got cinderfella for the holidays
bernard herrmanns iconic score rises as we move across hitch alma tomasini and peggys faces as they watch the moviola
the impact of the music is instant and unimaginably powerful
they are all moved
hitchcock looks down
peggy is gripping his arm tightly
what do you think
i think im never going to take a shower again
they look at him
its getting there
alma turns to him and hitch nods slightly
was that the tiniest acknowledgement that her instinct may have been right
hitchcock sits opposite him at the big conference table
i told you i distinctly saw both the stabbing and the nudity
were denying your seal mr
i take your opinion very seriously
but what you think youre seeing is purely informed by the power of suggestion
i assure you that once you view the final version with mr
herrmanns lovely lyrical score
a lyrical score wont change my opinion
all that innuendo and half naked groping really hitch
would you mind if we had a word in private geoffrey
shurlock gestures his staff out
hitch moves closer
i have a modest proposal to make
if youre willing to leave the shower sequence as it is i will reshoot the opening love scene to your exact specifications
shurlock reacts with surprise
in fact id welcome your personal supervision on the set
shurlock is more flattered than hed care to admit
if only audiences could fully appreciate how tirelessly you work to help us entertain them while protecting them from filth and indecency
shurlock studies hitchcocks sphinx like expression
hitchcock and peggy confer
john gavin and janet leigh wearing robes chat while lying on a bed
crew members wait impatiently
peggy checks her watch
hes been harassing you since you announced this project you invite him to the set and he doesnt even show up
what did you tell him
that i respected him
now she understands
ladies and gentleman that is a wrap
thank you all
the crew starts breaking things down
the actors are baffled
janet walks over to him
i thought we were reshooting the scene
the charade is over
hitch holds out his arm for her and walks her back to the dressing room
see i wasnt that much of a monster to work with was i
not at all
he offers his hand and she shakes it determined to be professional to the end
i just hope i was sufficiently loyal to the cause
worthy of a purple heart my dear
she leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek
a moment of unexpected heaven that leaves hitch speechless
she walks away to her dressing room
hitch watches as she steps inside and closes the door
after a moment we hear a piercing scream janet recoils at the sight of a mrs
bates prototype prop mask grinning lewdly from her chair and wearing one of janets brassieres
hitchcock peeks inside as crew members come running
i hope you dont mind i told mrs
bates she could have your dressing room
she cant believe shes been caught out
she closes the door on everyone
and then after a moment screams again
but this time not out of shock
hitch sweeps in
lew is waiting for him
we have our seal from shurlocks office
now we lead the lambs to the slaughter
hitch turns to lew for the latest news
the front office confirmed
theyre only opening the movie in two theatres as we suspected
and no premiere
if we dont get word of mouth were dead
then wed better get started
peggy take a memo
peggy whips out her steno pad
were going to write a manual on exactly how to sell psycho
booklets make the rounds on a conveyor like contraption
as the booklets are bound by swift moving workers we see hitchcocks photo on a cover and his advice to theater owners
my first instruction to theater owners hire pinkerton guards to strictly enforce our unique admission policies
a manager opens up his psycho promotional handbook and starts to read totally baffled
furthermore because psycho is so terrifying and unique the guards can help you deal with customers who run amok
the manager introduces the pinkerton guards to his equally bemused staff
post our special lobby clocks to remind audiences of the starting times for psycho
he oversees as they hang a ridiculously large psycho clock in the lobby
hitchs voice booms from large speakers mounted under the the manager of this fine motion picture theater has been advised not to allow anyone to enter the theater once psycho
we pan down to the staff and guards as they test out the recorded message that will be played for the ticket holders line
a couple of passersby listen perplexed
should you be so foolish as to attempt to slip in by a side entrance
a fire escape or through a skylight you will be ejected by brute force
hitch lays down the track into a large microphone while alma watches from the recording desk
more playful darling
a row of life size hitchcock standees are carried in through the door one by one
posters are hung in the theatre lobby
the letters hoisted up and hung on the marquee outside
to further emphasize the sheer unrelenting shock and suspense of psycho right after the closing title the end we strongly recommend that you close your house curtains over the screen
for a full thirty seconds
inside the theatre the manager makes sure the curtains open and close correctly then turns to face the vast empty auditorium
by doing so the horror of psycho will be indelibly etched in the mind and heart of your audience
he anxiously surveys the hundreds of seats that will have to be filled
now barney balaban is reading hitchcocks publicity manual to the board
absolutely never ever will i allow anything to follow psycho no previews of coming attractions no newsreel no short subject and certainly no double feature
sincerely and emphatically alfred hitchcock
balaban shuts the pamphlet
then turns to the stone faced board members at the end of the day its a minor hitchcock movie
one week and itll be gone
he tosses the pamphlet into the trash
like a bad dream
on hitch and almas silent tense expressions as they drive through the frenetic madness that typifies times square
a dazzling marquee for alfred hitchcocks psycho
the car pulls up
hitch and alma step out
theres a long line of people outside the theatre
well at least there are some people here
but hitchs nerves are hardly soothed
the people in line start to notice the hitchcocks
is it really them
comes over to greet them with the theatre manager
we can go through the side entrance
as the theatre manager ushers them through the side alley right this way mr
hitchcock turns to alma
ready for the gallows
the atmosphere is tense as people hurry to their seats
lew greets them
weve roped off some seats for you
you go on ahead
are you sure
ill join you in a minute
off almas look
i want to double check the print
ill save you a seat
lew escorts alma and peggy into the auditorium
the soothing whir of the projector as hitchcock stands next to it
but the sound of the audience below tittering nervously is anything but reassuring
under his breath but theyre laughing too much
he peers down through the tiny window but cant see a bloody thing
hitch inches open the door and peers through the crack at the audience but now he cant read them
are they gripped with suspense or do they just hate it
from the lobby we see as he closes the door and leans back against the wall of the empty corridor
a scared lonely corpulent figure
theres nothing for him to do but wait
across the foyer a spotty young theatre employee sweeps up ticket stubs and empties ashtrays quietly going about his business entirely oblivious
as he grips the railing
this is taking far too long
and then finally the sweetest sound in the world a soon the whole audience screams in terror
then breaks into laughter again
nervous laughter this time the best kind
as he gestures with his hands a conductor leading his orchestra raising them up again as the audience starts screaming again right on cue as the dam breaks and all
the pent up emotion floods out
leaving only relief and satisfaction
and making way for a smile
the largest of his whole career
hitch alma and peggy are led out into the foyer by the theatre manager
there are still screams in the theatre as the show continues
lew can be seen on the phone in the theatre managers office in the background as hitch alma and peggy walk past the line of ticket buyers to get to
the front doors
there is great excitement now as more and more people recognize the hitchcocks
hitchcock how does it end
i promised mother i wouldnt tell
he gets a laugh
hitchcock walks alongside the theater manager whos not going to miss out on having his own moment with the crowd
hitchcock what do i do now that my wife wont take a shower after seeing your movie
have her dry cleaned
laughter as lew appears
i just got off the phone with balaban
i couldnt resist telling him were sold out for the next two weeks
what did he say
he said tell hitch congratulations
a well deserved triumph as we always knew
as we always knew
the two friends a look
does this mean i can take the weekend off now
hitch playfully shrugs well see
im sorry mr
hithcock but there are photographers outside
they heard you were here
the theatre manager ushers them towards the exit doors
a few photographers snap hitch as he emerges and heads past the line of ticket buyers towards the waiting car
hitchcock gestures for alma to take her place next to him instead of behind him
she shyly waves him away but eventually and appreciatively relents
as the flashbulbs start to pop this could be the biggest hit of your career alfred
our career alma
he looks into her eyes with nothing but deep intense gratitude and joy
as more flashbulbs pop ive realized ill never be able to find a hitchcock blonde as beautiful as you
you do realize ive been waiting decades to hear you say that
he gives her a gentle peck
and that madame is why they call me the master of suspense
he helps her into the car
it is a utilitarian institutionalized dining room
several nonviolent inmates eat at different round tables around the room
an attendant watches and an orderly mops the floor there are no female patients nor staff members
is at a table with two other patients including a soft spoken older man chet
ed is heavier his hair is whiter and he is much more at ease than weve ever seen
to the attendant guess what im doing this weekend
claudine and i are driving to chicago with her folks to see that psycho movie
the attendant pulls the orderly aside and whispers to him nodding toward ed
the orderlys jaw drops
it is the coolest thing hes ever heard
he looks at ed like hes a movie star
meanwhile ed yawns content
i think youre the happiest guy ive ever known ed
how you do it
ill tell you
you live your life and its unbearable sometimes but theres this secret chet a big secret no one else knows or wants to tell
he leans a little closer there is a god and hes so big and powerful he doesnt always remember youre there
he takes a huge bite blueberry pie
but if you can get his attention and he sees youre suffering hell notice and hell take care of you
my mother used to tell me shes passed god bless her the one thing god truly loves and understands is suffering
he takes a long drink of milk
after all he invented it
we pan to discover hitchcock has been watching all this
he turns to the camera
and so gentle viewer psycho the picture everyone predicted would bring me to wrack and ruin was such a hit that alma and i got to
well lets just say that we got to keep our house and the swimming pool
and the same critics who despised it went on to call it one of my greatest achievements
he produces a cigar and wanders towards the exit doors
of course for me it was just another moo vie
as he strolls through the door and seamlessly appears in the beautifully tended gardens as if having walked through a portal
but you know what they say in hollywood youre only as good as your last picture
so now if youll excuse me i must toddle off to begin the exhaustive search for my next project
he holds out his cigar towards something we dont yet see
unfortunately i find myself once again bereft of all inspiration
i do hope something comes along soon
alights on his cigar tip and flaps its wings
hitchcock cant resist blowing a sadistic plume of smoke at the bird which promptly flies away
he gives the camera a final characteristically deadpan look
