written by phil alden robinson march my fathers name was john kinsella
a faded sepia shot of a dirty little kid on a farm
its an irish name
he was born in north dakota in
young man in doughboy uniform
and never saw a big city until he came back from france in
he settled in chicago where he quickly learned to live and die with the white sox
died a little when they lost the world series
photo of shoeless joe jackson
died a lot the following summer when eight members of the team were accused of throwing that series
dad a catcher playing ball
he played in the minors for a year or two but nothing ever came of it
moved to brooklyn in married mom in and was already an old man working at the naval yards when i was born in
ray as an infant
with his father
in front of ebbets field in miniature dodger uniform etc
my names ray kinsella
mom died when i was three and i suppose dad did the best he could
instead of mother goose i was put to bed at night to stories of babe ruth lou gehrig
and the great shoeless joe jackson
dad was a yankees fan then so of course i rooted for brooklyn
but in the dodgers moved away so we had to find other things to fight about
and when it came time to go to college i picked the farthest one from home i could find
berkeley in the s hippies protesters etc
this of course drove him right up the wail which i suppose was the point
officially my major was english but really it was the sixties
ray looking foolish in long hair and tie dye
i marched i smoked some grass i tried to like sitar music
and i met annie
annie blue jeans t shirt freckles
the only thing we had in common was that she came from iowa and i had once heard of iowa
we moved in together
after graduation we moved to the midwest and stayed with her family as long as we could
unsmiling american gothic types
almost a full afternoon
the apartment ray at different jobs the wedding
we rented an apartment and i took a job selling insurance
i also drove a cab and worked in a pizza parlor
dad died in june of
annie and i got married that fail
a few years later karin was born
she smelled weird but we loved her anyway
then annie got the crazy idea that she could talk me into buying a farm
ray annie and four year old karin by the sold sign of their farm
ray in a cornfield
im thirty eight years old and im about to become a farmer
i love my family i love baseball and i miss new york
moving in on rays face
but until i heard the voice
id never done a crazy thing in my whole life
it is dusk on a spring evening
the sky is a robins egg blue and the wind is soft as a day old chick
ray kinsella is working in the cornfield when a voice like that of a public address announcer speaks to him
if you build it he will come
ray looks up and around but sees nothing that could be the source of this sound
all around him are empty fields
he stands quietly for a few moments then goes back to work
if you build it he will come
ray jerks his head in all directions to see where this voice is coming from but again he sees nothing unusual just the furrowed fields and a few hundred feet
away the massive old farmhouse with a sagging veranda on three sides
on the north veranda is a wooden porch swing where annie and karin sit sipping lemonade and dreaming
annie what was that
what was what
like an announcement
annie confers briefly with karin then calls back to ray
we didnt hear anything
ray thinks for a second then shakes it off trying to dislodge that thought from his mind and gets back to work
if you build it he will come
again he bolts upright and looks around
again he sees nothing
this is beginning to bug him
he calls okay you mustve heard that
annie and karin lock at each other and exchange a shrug
annie extends her arms palms upward and calls to ray
annie leads karin inside
ray looks all around him with an okay fellas whats the joke
look on his face
but there is no one there
he puts down his tools and walks toward the house
ray enters looks at his wife skeptically and joins his wife and daughter setting the table
was there like a sound truck on the highway or something
kids with a radio
you really hearing voices
more like a
annie shoots him an are you kidding
ray responds with a shrug
they sit down to eat
whatd it say
if you build
it he will come
if you build what who will come
he didnt say
ooh i hate it when that happens
they are snuggled together asleep
all is quiet
then if you build it he will come
rays eyes pop open
he looks at annie who does not stir
without moving he looks around the room
there is no one there
very quietly he crosses to the window and looks out
he whispers out toward the cornfield build what
behind him annie stirs
its okay honey im just talking to the cornfield
he sighs and goes back to bed
annie cuddles up to him
her eyes are closed but rays eyes remain open
he is puzzled and concerned
a scene from the movie harvey in which james stewart insists he is conversing with an invisible rabbit
ittle karin is watching harvey while she eats her breakfast
ray enters looking like he had very little sleep and promptly turns the tv set off
whyd you do that
it was funny
trust me karin its not funny
the man is sick
hes very sick
annie enters putting on her coat
karin if youre finished get your coat and school bag
karin bolts from the table
uh honey ill take her today
iv e got some errands in town
she takes off her coat and kisses ray as he takes the car keys and heads outside
annie sits at the kitchen table
what if the voice calls while youre gone
take a message
she grins turns on the tv and watches harvey
rays car pulls up karin runs out and ray drives off
ray is plugged into some weird looking contraption having his hearing examined
then the doctor shines a penlight into his eyes shrugs and starts putting his gear away
well i cant find anything wrong
i could recommend a shrink but hey people hear things all the time
i heard a voice once
i was still living with my parents then
they worked in the circus so i was raised in the circus and i was training to be a clown
this one day im putting on my little red nose and i hear a voice tells me to go to medical school
here i am
ray is not sure if he should ignore this or run
farmers are loading up with seed fertilizer and other farmer stuff
this is the kind of place where people also linger to exchange gossip swap lies and pass the time
ray is off to one side chewing the fat with an old timer
in all those years did you ever
ive heard that sometimes farmers out in the field
you hearing voices
its just that i heard some farmers do and
i of course dont so i was wondering if i was doing something wrong or something
did you ever hear voices out there
calls from her whos hearing voices
out in the fields
now everyone in the store turns to look at ray
no im not
but the people still stare
ray addresses them
that darn tractor its
forces a nervous well ill just get some in oil that should
nice talking to you
ray is out in the fields again hard at work
a breeze picks up
he stops fora moment cocks an ear and looks around
all he sees are the empty fields
insects make the only sounds
he goes back to work
then if you build it he will come
he throws his tools down angrily and looks all around but there is no apparent source of the voice
ray is pissed
all right who are you and what the hell do you want from me
all he hears is a faraway echo
if you build it he will come
this is serious
ray shakes his head and repeats the words to himself
if you build it
as he thinks about these words some unexplained impulse causes ray to turn his head deliberately toward a portion of the cornfield between him and the house
for the briefest of moments the dreamlike image of a baseball field at night illuminated by floodlights flares in over the lawn
standing on the edge of the field is the figure of a man with his back to us
before we can see anything else the image disappears
rays eyes widen
he will come
i the man and the field the dream image flares in again this time closer to the man
he stands in the middle distance silhouetted by the lights and we see he is wearing a uniform of some kind
he starts to turn slowly towards us but before we can see his face the image disappears
rays mouth opens
he half laughs as if to say this cant be
but whatever is in his mind wont go away
he will come
now we see him in head and shoulders
he has the muscular neck of an athlete
as he slowly turns we start to see a bit of his weathered face before the image flares out
wheels are turning inside his head
he is trying to figure all this out
in the distance a bell is ringing
he looks o
annie is on the veranda ringing the dinner bell hanging by the front door
we see ray emerge slowly from the fields the twilit sky changing colors behind him
annie leans against a post lazily watching ray approach
she likes how he moves and how he looks
ray climbs up the steps accepts her kiss and instead of following her into the house pulls her down with him onto the swing
he takes her hand and looks into her eyes
youre not going to believe this
you heard the voice again
wait this gets better i just saw a vision
get out of here
i swear to god
an actual vision
were going to have to burn you at the stake if this keeps up
family is eating dinner
ray seems lostin thought
hey you dont suppose this could be like an acid flashback do you
i never took acid
maybe you will someday and its a flash forward
annie theres more
youre subscribing to the enquirer
i think i know what if you build it he will come means
oooh why do i not think this is a good thing
i think it means if i build a baseball field out there shoeless joe jackson will get to come back and play ball again
this is serious
ray and annie are putting little karin to bed
boy i thought my family was crazy but this
this is the craziest thing ive ever heard
its totally nuts
i mean shoeless joe hes
and hes the one they suspended right
he still dead
far as i know
ray and annie in their pajamas brushing their teeth getting ready for bed
you know what amazes me
no one could ever get you to believe in astrology or esp or reincarnation or heaven or any of that stuff
i think this shows real personal growth ray
annie smiles but sees that ray is troubled
she hugs him
i hope you know that even though i make jokes im going to visit you every month wherever they put you
he offers her a weak smile and exits
it is dark
for a few seconds it is quiet
then did you know babe ruth copied his swing
if i did id forgotten it
ray sits up in the dark
i always felt cheated i never got to see him play
he was supposed to be so graceful and agile
so to actually get to see him play again
to let him play again to right an old wrong
he shakes his head in wonder just to think of it
annie turns on the light
wait a minute bosco
are you actually thinking of doing this
i mean i cant think of one good reason why i should but
takes a breath im thirty eight years old i have a wife a child and a mortgage and im scared to death im turning into my father
whats your father got to do with this
ray tries to picture his father in his mind
he speaks softly but the words obviously have a great deal of meaning for him
i never forgave him for getting old
by the time hewas as old as i am now he was ancient
he must have had dreams but he never did anything about them
for all i know he may have even heard voices too but he sure didnt listen to them
the man never did one spontaneous thing in all the years i knew him
annie im scared that thats what growing up means
im afraid of that happening to me
and something tells me this may be my last chance to do something about it
looks at her i want to build that field
do you think im crazy
she looks at him with great understanding
he smiles wanly
she touches his face lovingly
i also think that if you feel you really have to do this
then you should do it
they hold each others gaze and ray cannot remember when he has loved her so much
he takes her in his arms
outside their window the field of corn lies waiting
stalks of corn wave slowly in the breeze
a bee buzzes near one
the light is yellow
suddenly the stalks bend violently to the ground as rays tractor plows them under
ray drives karin rides shotgun holding the large detailed diagram ray has drawn of the ballparks dimensions
ty cobb called him the greatest left fielder of all time
his glove was called the place where triples go to die
the tractor turns to plow under more corn and we can see the size of the area ray has staked off with marker sticks
could he hit
third highest in history
by the side of the road an old man and woman stand and watch these neighbors plow under their
they look at each other as if to say could it be communists
whyd they called him shoeless joe
it is days later an area the size of a baseball field has been plowed under and ray is seeding it
when he was still in the minors he bought a new pair of spikes and they hurt his feet
about the sixth inning he took them off and played the outfield in just his socks
the other players kidded him called him shoeless joe and the name stuck
we can see roughly where the grass has been planted and where the dirt will be smoothed out for the base paths
ray stands stock still in the moonlight water hose in hand patiently misting the baby grass little karin at his side
then in his team the chicago white sox threw the world series
they lost it on purpose
gamblers paid them to
now dozens of families stand to watch silent and dumb eyed at what has obviously become a daily spectacle among the townspeople
some snap photos
except shoeless joe
ray smooths out the base paths with a large roller as annie and karin follow behind with rakes
on either side of the base paths the infield and outfield grass is growing
nobody could prove anything one way or another but he was the one guy who probably wasnt in on it
ray annie and karin wait as the cashier totals up their load of lumber and hardware
i mean if he was supposed to be throwing it how do you explain the fact he hit for the series and didnt commit one error
twelve hits including the series only home run
and they said he was trying to lose
thats dollars sixty four cents
we hear oooh
ray turns and notices for the first time that a crowd of spectators employees and customers has been watching him and whispering among themselves
they look at him as if he had two heads
ray turns his attention back to writing a check for his purchases
he deadpans to annie wed better notify mars to send us more money
remlak wont like that
thats his problem
and tell him to make it in earth dollars this time
ray hands over the check to the open mouthed cashier
have a nice day
ray and annie turn and leave with karin
the farmers watch obviously trying hard to figure this one out
ray hammers the braces that will support the outfield wall
karin hands him nails from a bag she wears around her neck
theres a famous story about when he came out of the courtroom a kid ran up to him tugged his sleeve and said say it aint so joe
and jackson looked down t him and said im afraid it is kid
then what happened
annie helps ray lift a board to what will be the top row
the commissioner of baseball suspended eight of the players including the great shoeless joe jackson for life
they never let him play the game again
they continue to work in silence
ray writes a check for his purchases bats balls bases pitchers rubber home plate etc
he appears slightly annoyed that once again he is being stared at by all the uniformed employees of the store
he turns to catch the store owner staring at him the most intently
youre the fella that plowed under your corn and built a baseball diamond right
what about it
shakes his hand greatest damn thing i ever heard
the other employees beam their agreement
at these prices im not surprised
he wheels his shopping cart of sporting goods out through a gauntlet of approving salesmen
they smile and pat him on the back
ray cannot decide if theyre crazier than he is
atop the aluminum painted poles an array of store bought floodlights switch on flaring against the blue black sky
in this sharp white light the grass glows parrot green cool as mint soft as a cashmere blanket
annie and karin watch as ray puts down the clean white bases which pick up the light like little moons on a cold clear night
my father said he saw him years later playing under a made up name in some tenth rate league in carolina
hed put on fifty pounds and the spring was gone from his step but he could still hit
dad used to say no one could hit like shoeless joe
ray is smiling wistfully
thats the first time ive ever seen you smile as you mentioned your father
ray considers that
come on you
annie hoists karin on her shoulders with a grunt and the three climb their way down the bleachers
rays hand steadies annie as she takes one of the steps
moonl ight butters the iowa night
they walk along the side of the field and ray stops
he looks at the field
i have just created something totally illogical
thats what i like about it
am i completely nuts
she looks out over the baseball field
its a good baseball field ray
it is kinda pretty isnt it
annie smiles at him and carries karin inside
ray steps onto the porch and flicks the switch shutting off the floodlights over the field
annie opens her eyes and sees ray not beside her in bed but in th window seat looking out at the empty field
barely awake she gets out of bed shuffles to his side and curls up against him
somethings going to happen out there
i can feel it
annie lowers her head against his chest and goes back to sleep
outside the trees are fully leafed
the trees are almost bare now and theres a halloween pumpkin in the front window of the house
the cornstalks rustle like crumpling paper in the indian summer breeze which blows fallen leaves across the empty baseball field while ray sits in the stands
it is covered with snow
ray looks forlornly out the living room window towards his snow covered baseball field the merrily blinking lights of the christmas tree behind him belying his true mood
a baby robin tries to pull a worm out of the around
inside the house annie is doing spring cleaning
she looks out the window to see ray mowing the outfield grass
he stops looks around listens hears nothing and continues mowing
just watches him
we see the first exhibition game of spring training from florida as the announcer talks about a southpaw pitcher
little karin watches the tv while annie and ray sit at the living room table financial ledgers spread out before them as they struggle with their accounts
daddy whats a southpaw
a left handed pitcher
how bad is it
well given how much less acreage we have for corn id say well probably almost break even
weve spent all our savings on that field
just a minute karin
so what are you saying
we cant keep the field
it makes it real hard to keep the farm ray
ray closes his eyes
a little testy in a minute karin
theres a man out there on your lawn
ray opens his eyes and turns to see karin kneeling on the kitchen counter looking out the window
ray and annie exchange a quick glance and ray walks to the window
seen from outside as rays head appears and looks out
he sees something out there and just looks at it
there is a man standing on the edge ofthebaseballfield
hi es wearing a baseball uniform
ray turns to annie
she looks out and nods thoughtfully
annie stays very calm in emergencies
well put up some coffee
you go ahead
ray takes a breath and steps out onto the veranda
the night sky seems close enough to touch
on the porch wall ray finds the switch holds his breath flicks it and the floodlights sputter to life
steps onto the field
on his uniform is a large s with an o in the top crook an x in the bottom and an american flag with forty eight stars on his left
walks through the swirling ground mist toward the field
moving closer to the field we see the man standing out in left field
feet spread wide body bent forward from the waist hands on hips he waits
rays mouth is dry
he reaches home plate and picks up one of the bats lying beside the pail of hard balls
the back of his neck tingles
then he picks up one of the balls
the man spreads his feet pounds his small old style glove and waits to field the ball
ray tosses the ball a few feet into the air and swings at it
his face reddens he clears his throat and tries again
this time he connects
he has hit a grounder that would be easily fielded by a shortstop had there been one but it bounces through and falls into left field
the man runs in for it scoops it up cleanly and throws it back to the plate
ray is thrilled
he hits another ground ball and this too is fielded cleanly
then another which the man deftly short hops
ray hollers out to him
hows the field play
the ball bounces true
ray smiles with pride
he tosses up another ball gives it his best swing and is thrilled to see he has actually lofted one into the air
but into center field
the man sprints across the outfield and makes a lovely catch in short center
instead of throwing the ball in the man runs it in loping toward home plate
rays heart thumps
the man nods at him takes the bat and tests it to feel its weight
ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken
it is shoeless joe jackson after all who stands not five feet away from him trying out all the bats now
ray isnt quite sure if he should talk or ask questions or just stand there
finally he cant help himself
i bet its good to be playing again huh
it was like having part of me amputated
joe looks over at ray now his dark eyes evincing the pain his steady voice tries to conceal
ive heard that old man wake up and scratch itchy legs thatve been dust for fifty years
that was me
id wake up in the night with the smell of the ballpark in my nose and the cool of the grass on my feet
the thrill of the grass
he has found the bat he likes
can you pitch
yeah im not bad
joe hands ray the bucket of balls
ray can barely contain his excitement as he races to the mound
he stands on the rubber and faces joe at the plate
dont we need a catcher
not if you can get it near the plate we dont
ray smiles takes a breath and starts his windup during which he says aloud to himself i am pitching to shoeless joe jackson
he makes a pitch
its not a very good one and joe has to step across the plate to make contact but his swing is graceful compact and effortlessly powerful
he drives the ball against the fence
ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back jackson is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch
ray makes the standard pitchers gesture for a curve ball
see if you can hit my curve
he goes into an elaborate windup throws it it does not curve much and jackson whistles it right by rays ear
yes he can hit the curve
stick with fast balls kid
ray makes another pitch and jackson hits a line drive down the third base line
then a smoker down the first base line
ray is mightily impressed
damn this feels good
put it right here huh
joe holds the bat out low over the plate and ray pitches it reasonably close to that spot
jackson hits it out of the park and beams
ray brightens up with remembrance
right you were a low ball hitter
oh man i did love this game
you know id have played for food money
it was the game the sounds the smells
you ever held a glove or a ball to your face
ray smiles as he walks in from the mound
and it was riding the trains from town to town
and the hotels with brass spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds in the rooms
and it was the crowd getting to their feet when the ball was hit deep
shoot id have played for free
the sound of a screen door turns their
attention to the house
annie and karin are coming out to them
jackson nods and then points to the floodlights
whats with the lights
all the stadiums have them now except wrigley field
makes it harder to see the ball
the owners found that more people could attend night games
by now annie and karin have joined them
jackson my wife annie my daughter karin
hand and winks hi
are you a ghost
ray and annie are instantly embarrassed and try to cover with forced nervous laughter
to shoeless joe shes just kidding
what do you think
you look real to me
then i guess im real
would you like to come inside
uh thanks but
i dont think i can
ray and annie look at joe for a moment not quite understanding the ground rules here
joe senses their discomfort and changes the subject
hey can i come back again
i built this for you
there are others you know
there were eight of us
itd sure mean a lot to them
oh man anytime
theyre all welcome here
joe looks out over the field in eager anticipation of the good times to come
thank you ray
i appreciate it
see you later huh
see you later
say it aint so joe
joe laughs and walks to the outfield
annie puts her arm around ray and snuggles her head against his chest
nearby brook water splashes softly in the darkness a frog shrills and fireflies dazzle the night
joe is in the outfield grass now walking toward a door cut into the fence
wheres he going
through that door in the fence
since when is there a door in the fence
i dont know
i didnt put one there
joe reaches the door opens it and turns back to ray his voice carrying effortlessly through the night air
is this heaven
shoeless joe jackson nods and fades away as he walks through the door in the fence
ray and annie looks at each other in absolute wonder
were keeping this field
you bet your ass we are
youre going to lose your farm pal
it is sunday afternoon and annies family is visiting
her mother pink faced and white dentured sits ramrod straight in an antique rocking chair
also present are her brother mark and his wife dee
come on its so big
how can you lose something so big
you misplaced the house once
yeah but it turned up two days later didnt it
ray this stupid baseball field is going to bankrupt you
everybody knows it
all im saying is if you wait till you default on your loan you lose everything
sell now my partnersll give you a more than a fair price and you walk away with a nest egg
thanks mark but no
what are you holding on to this place for
youve never even liked iowa
you dont like farming you dont know the first thing about it hey i know a lot more about farming than you think
how could you plow under your major crop
whats a crop
karin enters breathlessly
daddy the baseball game is on
karin returns the smile and reaches her arms out to be picked up
she scissors her legs around her father at belt level hugging his neck
he exits carrying karin
mark shakes his head
i dont believe this guy
im trying to bail him out and he goes off to watch television
annie stifles a laugh
he used to be so normal
does he beat you
hes drinking right
he doesnt drink and he doesnt beat me okay
now ill grant you he has gotten me to worship satan with him but just a little
her mother gasps
her family has no sense of humor about this whatsoever
i think we need more cheese
she goes into the kitchen and when she has rounded the corner she raises her eyes to heaven and mutters families
karin and ray sit on the bleachers eating peanuts while shoeless joe and his seven teammates practice
three including shoeless joe are in the outfield two more in the infield one pitches one catches and one bats
the men are all in their twenties or thirties but show the sheer enjoyment of returning after an absence of sixty five years to the game they love
ray directs karins attention to the left fielder
watch his feet as the pitcher gets the sign and starts to pitch
a good left fielder knows what pitch is coming and he can tell from the
angle of the bat where the balls going to be hit
at the sharp crack of the bat shoeless joe whirls takes five loping strides toward the fence turns again reaches up and the ball smacks into his glove
one of the players good naturedly boos
aw stick it in your ear felsch
yeah if youd run like that against detroit ida won twenty games that year
oh for petes sake that was sixty five years ago
give it up will ya
you guys wanna play ball or what
you muscle bound jerk
at least i got muscles
at most you got muscles
come on asshole pitch
the good natured banter stops short and the other players glare at weaver who looks sheepishly toward the little girl and her father in the bleachers
all right karin
the players resume their practicing and ribbing
annie emerges with her mother mark and dee walking toward the bleachers where karin and ray are still watching the spirited practice
well it was
you know thanks for coming
think about what i said
i just want to help
mark just stands there for a moment the only sounds coming from the players on the field
i thought you two were going to watch some game
oh i guess its not really a game
its more like a practice
mark looks at his wife and mother with concern
ray doesnt understand this reaction
see theres only eight of them so they cant play a real game
eight of what
ray points to the noisy players on the field
now mother and dee look as if theyre about to go into mourning
mark kneels next to karin
what are you watching
the baseball men
do you see any baseball men right now
of course i do
mark stands up and shoots ray an accusing look
annies mother starts to walk away
i dont think its very polite to try to make other people feel stupid
annie questions mark and dee as they pass her on the way to catch up with mother
you dont see it
thats not funny annie
her family leaves in a huff
they couldnt see it
he and annie sit beside karin and watch the players
each slowly starts to smile
the practice is over the players are perspired and exhilarated
ray is over at first base talking with swede risberg the shortstop
here look at this
sixty five years since i worn this uniform still fits me like a glove
you must keep in pretty good shape
i died in
so i aint had a cigarette in what thirteen years
you dont smoke do you
felt good out there today huh guys
buck realizes that once again he has cursed in front of karin
i mean sorry
annie calls from the house
they all laugh
ray clearly loves being part of this locker room style comradery
karin runs to the house
come on fellas
lets hit the showers
see you later ray
see you guys
the players call their good byes to ray and head for the door in the outfield fence
ray watches them fade out as they go through the door
then he takes a moment to look around him
the baseball diamond set in the cornfield is quite beautiful
ray takes a satisfied breath and walks back toward his house
he is the very picture of contentment
then he hears the voice
ease his pain
ray stops short
i didnt understand
ease his pain
ray stops short
i didnt understand
ease his pain
but there is no response
ray enters as annie and karin are putting dinner on the table
ray plops into his chair at the head of the table
come on wash up
weve got a pta meeting after dinner
theyre talking about banning books again
really subversive books like wizard of oz diary of anne frank she notices ray is strangely silent
what happened to you
the voice is back
oh lord you dont have to build a football field now do you
shakes head no he said
ease his pain
ease whose pain
i asked him
he wouldnt tell me
i dont think so
one of the other players
i dont think so
this is a very non specific voice youve got out there ray and hes really starting to piss me off
ray nods as annie serves the meal in silence
parents stream in past the pta meeting tonite sign
ray and annie stand by the doorway talking with miss corser karins teacher
ray is too distracted by his own thoughts to pay this much attention
karin has such a wonderful imagination
lately shes been making up these charming little stories about ghosts who play baseball in a cornfield
she gets that from ray
miss corser smiles approvingly
ray realizes both women are looking at him now and he emerges from his thoughts
annie leads ray inside
ray and annie along with a hundred or so other grownups are sitting in chairs too small for their grownup backsides
ray is still lost in his own thoughts doodling ease his pain over and over again while an irate mother has the floor holding up a novel
and i say smut and filth like this has no place in our schools
a large portion of the audience applauds
annie whispers snarlingly to ray fascist
id like to ease her pain
ray is still lost in thought
perkins the book you are waving about is hardly smut
it is considered by many critics as the classic novel about growing up in the s
whispers to ray i read it four times
funniest book i ever read
the supreme court said its not
and its author mr
mann is sick
terence mann is a pulitzer prize winner and was widely regarded as the finest satirist of his time
well i think hes a pervert and quite probably a communist too
the crowd murmurs its assent
what planet are these people from
ray looks as if he is starting to realize something
the se called novels of terence mann endorse promiscuity godlessness the mongrelization of races and disrespect to high ranking officers of the united states army
and thats why right thinking school boards all across the country have been banning this guys shit since
you know why he stopped writing books
because he masturbates
i cant take this anymore
annie stands and smiles disarmingly
excuse me madam but youre speaking of something about which you dont know squat
terence mann was a warm and gentle voice of
reason during a time of great madness
he coined the phrase make love not war
when others were chanting burn baby burn he was writing about love and peace and understanding
he helped define an era
and a generation
and he helped us laugh at ourselves
i cherished every one of his books and i dearly wish hed write more
and if you had experienced even a little bit of the sixties you might feel the same way too
i experienced the sixties
i think you had two fifties and moved right on to the seventies
well your husband plowed under his corn and built a baseball field
the crowd oohs and aahs
now theres an intelligent response
ray is so excited at his revelation that he really wants to leave immediately
he tugs annies sleeve
but annie mistakes her husbands intentions
she thinks he is cautioning her not to get embroiled in trouble
its okay ill be cool
aloud to the at least hes not a book burner you nazi cow
now the crowd erupts
youre both a bunch of weirdos
annie pulls herself up to her full and thrusts an angry finger at
all right beulah you wanna step outside
the other woman takes a half step backward
no one has ever seen sweet annie like this
i got a better idea
lets put it to a vote
whos for eva braun here
who wants to burn books
who wants to piss on the constitution of the united sates
the majority who had sided with the book banner wants to vote for censorship but under these terms just cant raise their arms
little annie is on a roll now
now whos for the bill of rights
who thinks freedoms a pretty good thing
lets see those hands
some people start raising their hands
who thinks we have to stand up to the kind of censorship they have in russia
reluctantly just about everyone raises their hands
annie is thrilled
there you go
all right america
im proud of you
i mean it
annie we gotta go
to the crowd we gotta go
ray pulls her from the room
each is proud as hell each for a different reason
as they burst out bubbling over with their enthusiasm
oh ray was that great or what
it was like the sixties again
i figured it out
step outside you nazi cow
i know whose pain im supposed to ease
i know whose pain im supposed to ease
ray i just halted the spread of neo facism in america and youre talking about terence mann
what about him
thats whose pain
how do you know that
i dont know
i just know
i was right about building the field wasnt i
whats his pain
i dont know
then how are you supposed to ease it
i dont know
none of this questioning has dampened rays pride and excitement
annie shakes her head
tries to put hes my favorite writer too but
whats terence mann got to do with baseball
rays smile freezes
he hasnt a clue
a montage of ray at the library checking indices reading old magazines finding newspaper interviews on microfilm s couring old anthologies and taking copious notes
some of the articles include where is terence mann now that we really need him
rumors about americas greatest living ex writer
and terence mann still ignoring us after all these years
the photographs show mann to be a large black man with gentle eyes
annie its incredible
ray and annie run down the steps to the street for their car rays words racing as fast as his feet
by the early seventies the guy decides people have become either too extremist or too apathetic to listen to him
so he stops writing books
he starts writing poetry
about whales and stuff
then he starts fooling around with a home computer and gets hooked
know what he does now
annie shakes her head no
he writes software for interactive childrens videos
they teach kids how to resolve conflicts peacefully
what an amazing guy
so whats it got to do with baseball
in the april issue of jet magazine theres a story of his called this is not a pipe
annie laughs at that
ray is so excited he laughs too
its not his best work but the hero of the story a character that mann created twenty six years ago is named john kinsella
she stops short
he gives her a see
whatd i tell you
what can i say
big wow but
whats it got to do with baseball
they are standing by their car
annie drives as ray excitedly consults his notes
the last interview he ever gave was in
guess what its about
some kind of team sport
annie he was a baseball fanatic
listen to this he finds a page and reads from it as a child my earliest recurring dream was to play at ebbets field with jackie robinson and the brooklyn
of course it never happened and the dodgers left brooklyn and they torn down ebbets field
but even now i still dream that dream
they have arrived home and are walking into the house
he is still spouting things to her his research has uncovered
the man wrote the best books of his generation he was a pioneer in the civil rights and anti war movements he made the cover of newsweek he knew everybody
he did everyting
he helped shape his time
he hung out with the beatles
but in the end it wasnt enough
what he missed
annie takes a look at rays handful of xeroxes
oh my god
as a small boy he had a bat named rosebud
ray disapprovingly grabs the xeroxes back
he hasnt been to a live baseball game since
so to ease his pain you have to take him to a ball game
as they enter and put away their things
ray this is nuttier than building the field
no its not
its pretty weird i grant you but building the field was weirder
five ten percent weirder
im sorry pal but i have to nip this one in the bud
we are having moderate to heavy financial difficulties here
you cannot take off for boston while youre going broke in iowa
annie this is really new territory for both of us i know but were dealing with primal forces of nature here
when primal forces of nature tell you to do something the prudent thing is not to quibble over details and starting to get but why do you have to go
why cant the voice send someone else
whats wrong with shirley maclaine she too busy
what does this have to do with you
ray hears her anger and sits her down
thats what i need to find out
ray were behind on the mortgage
that field ate up our savings
we could lose the farm
i wont even stay in motels
ill sleep in the car and ill beg for food
this is too much
i understand your need to prove to the world youre not turning into your father but youve done it
you believed in the magic and it came true
isnt that enough
annie its more than that
i know this is nuts but theres another reason im supposed to do it
i feel it
i feel it as strongly as ive ever felt anything in my life
theres a reason
just tell me what it is
i think somethings going to happen at the game
i dont know what but
theres something at fenway park in boston and i have to be there with terence mann to find it
something he just said changes annies mood
is that the one with the big green wall in left field
i dreamt last night you were at fenway
uh was i sitting on the first base side
about the fifth row
nods you were keeping score and eating a hot dog
i had the same dream
ill help you pack
ray is throwing clothes into a suitcase as fast as he can
annie reads from a road map she has marked for him
you take that to and then it gets all squiggly and after that youre on your own
how are you going to find him anyway
he wont exactly be in the phone book you know
the article says he has a storefront on harvard street next to some place that sells kosher food
shouldnt be too hard to find
i dont need a tie do no dear
not for a kidnapping
ray has packed the car and is getting ready to leave
youll be okay right
ill try to sell the combine
we sure dont need it anymore
karin runs up grabs ray behind each ear and hugs and kisses him
so long tiger
he get into the car and looks up at annie
ill call you every night
if the team shows up while im gone just tell them
shakes his head on second thought stay away from them
those guys havent been near a woman since
ray theyre not going to make a pass at me
keep away from them
she laughs kisses him and watches him drive off
rays brave little datsun chugs along the interstate between eighteen wheelers busses gasoline tankers auto transport trucks and other monsters
boring roadside restaurants
looking at the map
signs that announce the entering and leaving of various states
days turning to nights and back again
finally the green hills of massachusetts
he emerges from a tunnel and enters traffic the likes of which he has not seen in a very long time
on one side of the expressway there are sweaty factories and on the other old wood frame apartment buildings with advertising for long forgotten products painted on the sides
lunatic drivers abound
we are not in iowa anymore
he rehearses as he drives
hi im ray kinsella
im really a big fan of
how do you mr
mann i have to take you to a baseball game
all right put your hands up and get in the trunk
ray drives slowly looking for a store that sells kosher food
but in this old newish neighborhood there are dozens butcher shops delis bakeries groceries
ray is asking the spritely jewish butcher for directions
he lives right around here
do you know him
im a friend of his
the butcher just stares back with suspicion
hes sort of a tall black man
if you was much of a friend hed of give you the directions himself
he knows this is useless
thats a good point
ray has stopped an ancient jewish woman on the street
she looks from rays iowa license plate to rays face
i dont know where he lives
but by her raised eyebrows and the tone of her voice it is clear that if she did know which she probably does she certainly wouldnt tell him
ray has pulled his car to the edge of the gas station he is not buying gas and slips a five dollar bill to the ruddy faced teenaged irish pump
two blocks down
right hand side
first store that dont have a chicken in the window is his
in between a deli and a kosher butcher shop ray finds a storefront with blacked out windows
he enters an open hallway in which he sees the door to the storefront as well as stairs to the apartments above it
there are half a dozen mail boxes on the wall
ray checks the names
all but one have immigrant names
the first one reads ray turns to the storefront door
instead of a buzzer there is a long wire with a weight on its end hanging from a hole at the top of the door
next to the wire is a handwritten note taped to the door which reads you better have a goddamn good reason for ringing this bell
this guy is great
he pulls on the wire
on the other side of the door a bell rings
ray has to struggle to control his nervousness
he takes a breath
he hears footsteps inside approaching the door
he cannot help but smile with delight at the thought of meeting one of his cultural heroes
the door opens
terence mann is menacingly huge
he glares at ray and roars who the fuck are you
ray is momentarily taken aback but he figures maybe the guy is joking so he just smiles and plunges ahead
sir my name is ray kinsella and its a great pleasure co finally the door slams in his face
it takes ray a few seconds to realize the interview is over
he rings the bell again
the door opens
manns large frame fills it
we got a learning disability here
mann ive come miles to see you at the risk of losing my home and alienating my wife
if i could just have a minute
i cant tell you the secret of life and i dont have any answers for you
i dont give interviews i am no longer a public figure i just want to be left alone
so fuck off
just one minute
im begging you
mann looks him over
then he sighs
mann turns and enters the storefront
it is hardly fashionable but its roomy and comfortable
there are tables stacked high with mailing envelopes and a postage scale
a few workbenches have software and spread sheets strewn across them
in the back are a couple of personal computers
on a side wall there are book jackets and newspaper photos in cheap frames pictures of mann with martin luther king
with bob dylan
with timothy leary
rann being arrested at some demonstration
mann at woodstock
manns gruff voice pulls rays attention away from these relics
your minute aint getting bigger
i understand your desire for privacy and i wouldnt dream of intruding if this werent extremely important
i dont do causes anymore
this isnt a cause
i dont need money or an endorsement
you once wrote there comes a time when all the cosmic tumblers have clicked into place and the universe opens itself up for a few seconds to show you what
oh my god
youre from the sixties
well actually out
just wait a second mann picks up an old fashioned bug sprayer the kind with a long arm that pumps in and out and starts spraying it at ray as
if he were an unwanted insect
back to the sixties
he is backing ray out the door
if youd just theres no place for you here in the future
get back while you still can
he gets ray just past the door and slams it shut
ray slams it open
youve changed you know that
mann stops fuming and considers that
he sighs sadly
i suppose i have
smiles and makes the peace sign peace love dope
now get the fuck out of here
and he slams the door shut again
ray is flabbergasted
he is thinking furiously
then he notices that in slamming the door the latch has not locked in place
he thinks makes up his mind and quietly opens the door
mann has returned to work his back to the door
ray enters the loft his left hand in his jacket pocket
when he is halfway across the loft he clears his throat
mann spins around
now youve pissed me off
okay hold it right there
he juts his pocketed hand forward as if he had a gun in his jacket
i was hoping i wouldnt have to do it this way
what the fuck is that
its a gun
whatd you think it is
its your finger
no its not
its a gun
let me see it
get out of here im not going to show you my gun
mann sighs and stands
im not going to hurt you i just need you to go with me for a little while then what are you doing
mann has found a crowbar among his tools and is advancing toward ray
im going to beat you with a crowbar till you go away
understandably this makes ray nervous
you cant do that
what are there rules
theres no rules
mann is almost to him now the crowbar raised above his head
youre a pacifist
he lowers the crowbar
ray breathes a sigh of relief
all right are you kidnapping me
whats the deal here
i was hoping i could just convince you to come with me
then you are kidnapping me
i have to take you to a baseball game
something will happen there
i dont know what but well find out when it does
mann now has no idea what to make of all this so he just looks ray over for a few seconds
my name is ray kinsella
you used my fathers name for a character in one of your stories
youre seeing a team of psychiatrists arent you
i dont blame you for thinking that but no im not
i swear to god im the least crazy person ive ever known
then why are you kidnapping me to a baseball game
i read an interview you gave a long time ago about how you always dreamed of playing at ebbets field and how sad you felt when they tore it down
shakes head no i never said that
i dont even remember thinking it
now ray is ndt sure what to do
thing is so weird
then why go through with it
its a long story
and ill tell you on the way
im not going to get rid of you am i
if you just come to this game with me ill never bother you again
not even a christmas card
mann picks up a hat plops it on his head and heads out the door
mann sits tensely beside ray who drives with his right hand while his left hand remains in his pocket substituting for a gun
you do this often
its my first time
so be gentle
ray laughs nervously and is embarrassed to see mann not sharing the humor
you used to have a sense of humor
things used to be funny
ray pulls up at an intersection
he has to choose between left and right
behind him cars are honking
ray doesnt have a clue which way to go
this is really humiliating
which way is eenway
mann shakes his head then tilts it to the left
ray makes the turn and heads off down the street
youre really inept at this arent you
ray grins sheepishly and nods
i mean youre like a total bumbler
ray chuckles his reluctant acceptance of the truth
bozo the kidnapper
no longer so okay okay
after a few moments ray decidesto break the ice
can i ask you a question
something ive always wanted to know
hes been asked this question a million times
no i never slept with her
you never slept with who
whoever you were going to ask me about
if id been with one tenth the famous women they said i was with id be in formaldehyde by now
you slept with a lot of famous women
whats your question
howd you get a name like terence
mann cannot believe thats the question
rastus was taken
ray knows now to shut up
he returns his attention to his driving glances up to his rearview mirror and sees something that causes his eyes to widen in horror
a boston police car on his tail red lights flashing
mann looks behind him sees the police car and turns back to ray
ray wears a look of resignation as he pulls the car over to the side of the road and shuts off the ignition
mann just looks at him and starts to chuckle
nice going boze
i dont really have a gun
so dont say anything to this guy okay
i swear to god theres a reason were supposed to be at this game
mann gives him a give me a break look
ray sees the policeman is getting out of his cruiser and walking towards them
ray is desperate
if i get arrested the pressll be all over you youll have to appear in open court youll be the lead story on entertainment tonight and your picturell be on
the front page of every tabloid in america
the policeman knocks on rays window
he is young fresh scrubbed and earnest
ray holds up one hand to him
just a second
terence mann kidnapped
also seen in ufo with elvis
manns eyes narrow
the cop knocks again more insistently
ray rolls down the window
license and registration
nervously ray complies
mann turns his face toward the passenger side window
rays mouth dries up
he has no idea what mann will do
the policeman scrutinizes the license turns it over to look for convictions and checks rays face against the felonlike photo
then he looks at mann
and whats your name sir
mann keeps his face averted
where is it that you and raymond are going terry
were going to the ball game
turns to cop actually officer im being kidnapped
discreetly under his breath ray sings the entertainment tonight theme song
entertainment tonight doo doo doo doo doo doo
the officer looks at him questioningly
what i mean by that is i dont care much for baseball but raymond insisted
yeah i hate baseball
hands ray back your right taillight is out raymond
i want you to get it fixed at the first opportunity
the policeman walks away and ray heaves a sigh of relief
hostages call me ray
can i call you terry
sourly mann nods
ray smiles and drives off
and thank you
i didnt do it just because i dont want the publicity
then what else
i envy you your craziness ray
its been years since i did something completely crazy
well you want to hear something really crazy
do i have a choice
i live on a farm in iowa
one day out in the cornfield i heard a voice
it glides through city traffic
ray slides the datsun into a parking place and he and mann walk the short sleazy block to fenway and old fashioned center city ballpark
but cant you accept the probability that its all just a hallucination
annie and karin see it too
they have reached the ticket window
two field level first base side
the elderly ticket seller pulls out two tickets
ray takes out his wallet and turns to mann
its on me
youre damn right it is
ray pays the man and receives the tickets
game dont start for a while but you can go in watch batting practice
they enter the stadium
they walk through the indoor portion of the grandstand toward their section
so what do you do with yourself these days
ive learned to cook
i take walks
i watch sunsets
dont you miss being
i was the east coast distributor of involved
i ate it drank it and breathed it
then they killed martin
they killed bobby
and then they elected tricky dick
and now people like you think i must be miserable that im not involved anymore
well ive got news for you i spent all my misery years ago
i have no more pain for any of you
i gave at the office
they approach the refreshment stand
what do you want
i want them to stop looking to me for answers
begging me to speak again write again be a leader
i want them to start thinking for themselves
and i want my privacy
ray looks slightly embarrassed
no i meant what do you want from
ray points to the hot dog vendor as they have reached the front of the line
a dog and a beer
to the vendor two
okay i agree you should be entitled to as much privacy as you wane
but why stop writing
i havent published a word in seventeen years and i still have to endure assholes like you all the time
what do you think itd be like if i suddenly came out with a new book
mann is making sense
theyd bleed me dry
ray and mann emerge into the sunlight and walk down the aisle toward the field
god this place is so beautiful
the grass is so green you can almost smell it
looking around the old ballpark they see only about twenty or thirty die hard fans in the stands for batting practice a half dozen players are grouped around the batting
cage as one player hits to several others in the field
a few sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts
ray and mann stop at the first row right behind the red sox on deck circle lean on the railing and talk
it could be out there for all this place has changed
babe ruth stood on that very mound as a pitcher long before anyone knew he could hit home runs
why are we here ray
about the game
the game is in progress
ray and mann are in their fifth row seats
they do not speak
at one point ray becomes suddenly and strangely aware that something is about to happen
he looks at mann who is just watching the game
then he looks at the scoreboard
fenway park has a sophisticated scoreboard that flashes pictures of the batter and pitcher and can show instant replays of some of the action
right now the display is replaced by an oddly glowing message
the sounds of the stadium the game and the crowd fade out
there is only the message chisholm minn
new york giants game at bats the message does not just glow it pulsates
it looks almost otherworldly phosphorescent clearly unlike anything ever seen before on a ballpark scoreboard
ray looks around him
the sounds of the game return and from the unconcerned faces of the people near him he realizes that no one else can see the message
he opens his program and starts writing it down
mann notices this but cannot see what ray is writing
then ray hears the voice
go the distance
oh my god
whats the matter
whenever you wanttogo wecan go
if you want to go we can go
mann looks at ray curiously trying to read this new attitude
then lets go
mann rises and heads up the aisle
ray looks down at the program at the handwritten legend of moonlight graham who played one game fifty seven years ago but did not get to bat and follows mann
out of the ballpark
it is nighttime and mann drives
ray slumps dozing troubled
mann looks curiously at ray but says nothing
they ride in silence
the street is blue with moonlight as they park in front of the storefront
where are you goingfrom here
what is it youre not telling me
shakes head no ive taken up too much of your time
mann gets out of the car
i wish i had your passion ray
however misdirected it may be its still a passion
i used to feel that way about things but
ray slides into the drivers seat
you got another message didnt you
youll think im crazy
i already think youre crazy
what did it say
after a little thought ray smiles sadly
it said the mans done enough
leave him alone
ray puts the car in gear makes a wide turn and starts to head back up the street
but he stops short when manns form looks out of the darkness into the glare of the headlights
ray does not know why mann is blocking his path
or why he appears tense almost frightened
rays jaw drops
you saw it
new york giants
he played one game never got to bat
mann looks spectrial in the high contrast glare on the headlights
what did i see ray
we were the only ones who saw it
did you hear the voice too
mann glances at ray then looks away
its all right to admit it
thats what told me to find you
did you hear it too
go the distance
do you know what it means
were going to minnesota to find moonlight graham
what do we do when we find him
well know that when we find him
ray opens the passenger door of the datsun and mann jumps in
ray releases the brake and peels out burning rubber
the two men look happy as kids with bats over shoulders gloves dangling on their way to a sandlot
once on they begin the long haul across the great lakes states
ray drives mann dozes in the reclined passenger seat
annie im really sorry but im going to be a few days longer
is everything all right
everythings great andill tell you all about it when i get back but im going to minnesota now
now mann drives and ray tries to sleep his stockinged feet propped up on the dash occasionally sliding with a thud against the steering column
i dont believe this
whats in minnesota
an old ballplayer
ill explain when i get home
how are things with you
ray is using the pay phone on the wall of the office while the car is being gassed
hey guess what
terence mann is with me
were going to minnesota together
are you kidding me
oh ray thats unbelievable
i gotta go
hug karin for me
i love you
i love you too
you guys behave yourselves
ray smiles and hangs up
she hangs up and loses her smile as she turns back to the kitchen table where her brother mark sits with two men in business suits
why didnt you tell him
for the same reason ive never pissed on your birthday cake
annie you dont have a choice in the matter
annie looks vertroubldye
they are north of duluth andthelandscape hasgrown harsher the trees shorterandmore gnarled thegrass tougher and wirier
after virginia minnesota all the land is scarred
above the town the mines sit like sand colored bunkers in the cliffs stern and silent
near chisholm the land is getting ever weirder
it looks like a pasture rooted and rerooted by giant hogs
it has been split and gutted greenery has grown back but at weird and unnatural angles
but as they swing into town the highway divides and they cross a beautiful and tranquil lake so smooth and shiny it might be a scene painted on a glass
a sign reads ray and mann have parked on the main street next to a corner phone booth
ray is flipping through the thin phone book attached to the booth by a chain
half a dozen grahams
no archibald no moonlight
the local newspaper is located in a small storefront that was probably once a confectioners or a dry goods store
ray and mann are talking with the papers publisher veda ponikvar a handsome woman in her sixties with a sweet innocent smile and eyeglasses hanging from a fine chain around
were trying to find an ex baseball player named archibald graham
you mean doc graham
no i think his nickname was moonlight
yes thats doctor graham
this is interesting news to ray and mann
his baseball career never amounted to much so he went back to school
his father was a doctor
do you know where we can find him
its nothing bad
were not from the irs or anything doc graham is dead
he died in
ray and mann look at each other unsure of what this means to their quest
ray and mann sit at a table in the newspapers back room the morgue file on doc graham a collection of clippings pictures and the obituary strewn before them
right now their attention is on veda who has put her glasses on and is reading from an editorial
and there were times when children could not afford eyeglasses or milk or clothing
yet no child was ever denied these essentials because in the background there was always doctor graham
without any fanfare or publicity the glasses or the milk or the ticket to the ball game found their way into the childs pocket
you wrote that
the day he died
youre a good writer
the compliment is just right and she smiles warmly
mann spreads out the clippings and shakes his head
ray is looking at a photo of doc graham as a man in his late sixties
half the towns in north america has a doc graham
what makes this one so special we have to come halfway across the country to find him fifteen years after he died
theres got to be more
veda enters with a piece of paper from a yellow legal pad
you might want to talk to some of these people
they knew doc pretty well
mann takes the list and looks it over
two old codgers on a park bench
oh that man had an arm on him
one day over at the ballpark he said lemme see that ball and one of the boys threw him the ball and he walked over behind home plate reared back
and fired that ball over the left field fence
and he was at least fifty years old when he did it
it was still rising when it disappeared
a woman an older nurse
i went with him to make a housecall at one of the camps
the husband was sick and they had no stove so they had no heat
when we got back to chisholm doc went to the hardware store and bought a stove for them and paid to have it delivered
and i know that wasnt the only time he did something like that
several tables have been pushed together and mann sits surrounded by townspeople mostly men past retirement age
he didnt smoke or drink
but he used to chew up paper and spit it out wherever he went
if you were around doc very long you learned to duck
hed even chew up his prescription slips so sometimes wed have to dig into our pockets for a piece of paper so doc could write us prescriptions
he always wore a black overcoat even in the summer and it was always flapping open even in the winter and it was fifty below
and he had white hair like me and he always carried an umbrella
cept he was always i mean always losing them
stores round town would just lean his umbrella somewhere near the door and if anybody asked theyd just say oh thats docs umbrella
what was the umbrella for
oh i think it got to be a habit something to hang onto
but if youd ask him hed say it was to beat away all his lady admirers
this as much as the other remembrances brings warm chuckles to the old men
tell me about his wife
she moved to south carolina after he passed
she passed a few years later
she always wore blue
i bet you didnt know that
the woman manager of the motel is having acup of coffee with ray
you know everybodys talking about you two
our neighbors came over last night and we just told docgraham stories until after midnight
i even wrote some of them down
she takes out a piece of paper
thats very nice of you
well its funny
its like all these memories we have of doc had gone to sleep and sunk way down inside us
but once you started asking about him and started us talking about him why they swum back up to the surface again
ray and mann are sitting in their beds comparing their notes
no screwing no drinking no opium no illegitimate children
no midnight abortions no shady finances
ray puts down his notes and picks up the chicago tribune
you sound disappointed
shoeless joe had a problem
thats why he needed you
this guy doesnt need us
suddenly ray straightens with a start
oh my god
ray hurries over to mann offering the opened newspaper and points out an article to mann
it is headlined damn
his son who lives in new york city notified police after receiving no answer to repeated telephone calls
id better call him
he pulls the phone onto the bed and dials what the hell do i tell him
you want me to
he motions outside with his head
ray walks by the old movie theatre which sits at the edge of a residential street
the godfather is playing
he nods at an elderly man who passes him on the street
he passes a darkened house and notices there is a sign of some kind in its unlit front window
he takes another two or three steps before he has to stop to take a better look at the sign
it takes a second to make out the image in the dark but it is a head shot of richard nixon
above it says four more years
below it reads re elect the president
he turns and looks at the theatre marquee
under the letters that spell out the godfather are smaller letters that read nominated for academy awards
he says the word to himself
ray now looks at the car parked nearest to him
it is an old mustang
the annual tag on the license plate reads
all the cars on the street are pre
and still walking down the block away from him is the elderly man ray passed moments earlier
the man is about sixty five years old stooped a little but the body is still lithe an athletes body
he is wearing a dark overcoat
and he carries an umbrella
the little hairs on the back of rays neck stand up
his mouth is dry and for a moment he cannot speak
then he calls to the man
slowly the man stops and turns back to face ray
ray starts to trot to him
my name is ray kinsella
im from iowa
are you moonlight graham
the old man narrows his bright eyes to see ray more clearly
no ones called me moonlight graham for fifty years
well ive come
a very long way to see you
i couldnt sleep tonight
usually i sleep like a baby
so i told alicia i was going to take a walk
mind if i join you
id like to talk to you
doc nods and they start to walk
lets go to the high school
we can sit in my office
you want to talk about
well first of all howd you get to be called moonlight
cause of a night like this long ago
id just gotten to the minors and i went out to the ballpark
doc graham contd theres nothing as peaceful as a ballpark at night
like a church
yeah i know what you mean
anyway i fell asleep
next morning they found me in the on deck circle all curled up like a baby
someone called me moonlight and it stuck
doc fumbles out a key and lets them in
when you got to the majors you played only one inning of one game
what happened in that inning
they enter the hallway of the old school the smell of varnish and chalk almost palpable
it was the last day of the season
bottom of the eighth and we were way ahead
id been up with the club for most of a month but hadnt seen any action
just then old john mcgraw points a bony finger at me and says right field
well sir i jumped up like i was sitting on a spring grabbed my glove and ran out onto the field
they reach a varnished door with an opaque glass inset and enter
doc grahams office
doc seats himself behind a cluttered desk and motions ray to the black leather sofa a few feet away
did you get to make a play
doc takes a sheet of paper off his desk expertly rips an inch or so off the corner with his teeth and begins chewing
they never hit the ball out of the infield
ray chuckles but then flinches as doc shoots his little spitball towards him
it hits the back of the sofa a few feet from ray and hangs there like a white fly
i was warned about you
anyway one inning later the game was over and so was i
and what was that like
it was like coming this close to your dreams and then watching them brush past you like a stranger in a crowd
ray nods and a look of understanding begins to appear on his face
he looks out the window focused on faraway
except at the time you dont think much of it
hardly anybody recognizes the most significant moment of their life when theyre happening
back then i just figured thered be plenty more days
i didnt know that would be the only one
doc graham notices that ray is looking very serious
now let me ask you a question ray kinsella
what makes that half inning so interesting that you come all the way from iowa to ask me about it sixty five years later
ray chooses his words carefully
i didnt really know till just now
but i think its to ask you if you could do anything you wanted to
if you could have a wish
he smiles wryly takes a new piece of paper and bites off a little section
and are you the kind of man who could grant me that wish
i dont know
im just asking
doc leans his left elbow on the desk and rubs his forehead thoughtfully with a palm as if it were an eraser that could erase the years and take him
back to and the polo grounds in new york
i never got to bat in the major leagues
id have liked the chance just once to stare down a big league pitcher
stare him down and then just as he goes into the windup wink
make him wonder if i know something he doesnt
thats what i wish for
the chance to squint my eyes when the sky is so blue it hurts to look at it and to feel the tingle that runs up your arms when you
connect dead on
the chance to run the bases stretch a double to a triple and flop race first into third wrapping my arm around the bag
thats my wish ray kinsella
thats my wish
ray begins to smile
graham is staring intently at him
is there enough magic floating around in the night out there for you to make that wish come true
what would you do if i said yes
i think i might actually believe you
there is a place where things like that happen
and if you want to go there i can take you
docs eyes start to glisten and he offers an embarrassed smile as he wipes away a tear
if it means leaving chisholm
he shakes his head
ray is surprised
i understand but i think youre supposed to come with us
this is my most special place in the world ray
once a place touches you like this the wind never blows so cold again
you feel for it like it was your child
i cant leave here
ray cannot believe the man wont leave chisholm for his dream
but your wish
itll stay one
i was born here lived here and ill die here
ill have no regrets
but sixty five years ago for five minutes you came this close
holds up two it would kill some men to get that close to their dream and never touch it
theyd consider it a tragedy
if id only gotten to be a doctor for five minutes
now that would have been a tragedy
those words fill up the room and ray sinks back against the couch
well id better get home before alicia starts to thinking ive got a girlfriend
and doc graham smiles at him
and he smiled
it is later that same night and ray has been recounting his experience with doc graham to mann who appears quietly troubled
and then i figured maybe were not supposed to take him with us
so now i dont know why the hell we were supposed to come here
maybe it was to find out if one inning can change the world
it did for these people
if hed gotten a hit he mightve stayed there
your wife called before
she wants you to call her tonight
annie is asleep
the phone rings and the speed with which she picks it up suggests that her anxiety to get this phone call prevented her from sleeping very deeply
i asked the bank if we could miss a payment or two and they told me theyd just sold the note on the farm to mark and his partners
so they own the paper now and he says if we dont sell to them theyll foreclose
ray we dont have the money
ray holds the phone pained
they cant foreclose for thirty days or something like that
ive got to take terry back to boston first so itll be no
ray looks over at mann
im going to iowa with you
were coming home
ray drives with purpose and speed
mann looks relaxed
hell i couldnt quit now
ive got see this ballpark
not everybody can see it
you might not
ill give it a try
as they turn onto the highway near the lake a teenager with a dufflebag appears on the side of the road his arm raised in
a hitchhikers stance
ray pulls the car over to the side of the road
i need all the karma i can get right now
the car stops and the teenager runs for it
he tosses his dufflebag in the backseat and squeezes in after it
youre the first car by
i didnt expect to get a lift so soon
ray starts the car back onto the highway
how far are you going
how far are you going
well if its okay with you ill ride along for a while
i play baseball
ray and mann exchange brief smiles
im looking for a place to play and i heard that all through the midwest towns have teams and in some places theyll find you a day job so you
can play ball nights and weekends
this is your lucky day kid
were going someplace kind of like that
im ray kinsella this is terry mann
im archie graham
mann and ray just look at each other
and the little datsun heads off down the highway
archie sleeps in the backseat
im dying to ask him if he has a nickname
he didnt get it till he was in the minors
maybe we can give it to him
funny the way he described towns finding you a job so you can play on their team
they havent done that for years
my dad did that for a while
but that was in the twenties
what happened to your father
he never made it as ball player so he tried to get his son to make it for him
by the time i was ten playing baseball got to be like eating vegetables or taking out the garbage so when i was fourteen i started to refuse
can you believe that
an american boy refusing to have a catch with his father
why at fourteen
thats when i read the boat rocker by terence mann
i never played catch with him again
see thats the kind of crap people are always trying to lay on me
its not my fault you wouldnt play catch with your father
anyway when i was seventeen we had a big fight i packed my things said something awful and left
after a while i wanted to come home but i didnt know how
i made it back for the funeral
what was the awful thing you said
i said i could never respect a man whose hero was a criminal
who was his hero
shoeless joe jackson
mann considers this all very carefully
you knew he wasnt a criminal
then whyd you say it
i was seventeen
mann nods with growing understanding
so this is your penance
i cant bring my father back
so the least you can do is bring back his hero
well now we know what everybodys purpose here is
ray looks at him
he hadnt thought of that
after a few moments ray points to something in the distance
something down the road in the midst of all this flat farmland is glowing in the night
it is an illuminated baseball diamond in a cornfield
ray turns the datsun into the long driveway and with a rumble crosses the metal cattle guard that keeps livestock from escaping to the roadway
he eases the car to a stop in front of the house and as the three men unfold themselves from the car karin bolts from the back door of the
house a blur of white blouse and pink pedal pushers
she flings herself into rays arms and hugs his neck in unrestrained joy
then annie appears too
they kiss while mann and archie wait to be introduced
finally mann clears his throat
this is terence mann terry
annie steps forward wining some curls from her eyes with ahand that has recently been immersed in flour
she smiles wipes the hand on the thigh of her jeans and shakes his hand
and this young fellow is moon uh archie graham
karin and annie shake his hand
hes come to practice with the team
hell be able to do more than just practice
what does that mean
they walk towards the field
lets enjoy this place while we still have it
ray and annie walk silently with their arms around each other as they lead mann archie and karin to the bleachers
manns eyes widen as several of the players shout greetings to ray
hi ray welcome back
good to see you
oh my lord
thats shoeless joe jackson
well of course it is
ive seen pictures
those are the white sox
you mean you still didnt believe me
i thought i did but
oh my lord
they have reached the foul line where shoeless joe waits for them
terry id like you to meet joe jackson
joe this is terry mann
mann and jackson shake hands
its a pleasure to meet you
ray i hope you dont mind but we got tired of just having practices so we brought another team out with us so we could have some real games
he points to the visitors bench and indeed there are a dozen or so more old time baseball players in old time baseball uniforms
i dont mind
whered they come from
whered we come from
man you wouldnt believe how many guys wanted to play here
we had to beat em off with a stick
hey thats mel ott
and carl hubbell
those are the new york giants
with a couple of cardinals and as thrown in for good measure
ty cobb wanted to play but none of us could stand the sonofabitch when we were alive so we told him to stuff it
hey are you graham
ray and mann are astonished that shoeless joe knows who archie is
what the hell you doing on the sidelines
you came here to play ball didnt you
go warm up
archie quickly scampers down the bleachers onto the field shakes joes hand and runs to the dugout
its more than that
the white sox are in the field the giants at bat
a giant hitter bunts and the runner on second takes third despite a close throw
mann ray karin and annie are in the stands mann keeping score
does he get a hit for that
the batter was trying to sacrifice
so how do you score it
mann is impressed
he lifts karin up from her seat on the row below them and places her next to him to help him
you better sit here
ray taps mann and points to the plate
archie graham now wearing a giants uniform drops one of the two bats he has been swinging in the on deck circle and advances on the plate slashing the air
with a brand new bat the color of vanilla ice cream
he plants himself in the batters b
ox then cocks the bat the top end of it trembling as if he were stirring something and waits for the pitch
the pitcher looks in for his signs
archie stares back
as the pitcher goes into his windup archie winks at him
there is a moment of confusion and then anger on the pitchers face and when the ball speeds to the plate it is aimed right at archies head
he dives out of the way and hits the dirt hard
the catcher chuckles through his mask
good thing for you that wasnt his fastball
archie digs in again at the plate but backs up just a little
now his look to the pitcher is one of determination
come on lets see your fastball
the pitcher smiles winds up and throws
and right at archies chin
again he has to dive out of the way
this time however he gets right up and immediately appeals to the umpire
hey ump how about a warning
watch out you dont get killed
both benches laugh at that
archie holds up his hands to call time and steps out of the batters box
the on deck batter mel ott comes over
okay kid first two were high and tight where do you think the next ones going to be
either low and away or in my ear
he dont want to load the bases
look for low and away
archie nods and starts to walk back to the plate
but watch out for in your ear
archie takes his place in the batters box again
he still looks determined but a little less cocky
the next pitch is a curve that looks as if its heading right for him
but he holds his ground and when the ball breaks down and away he steps in snaps the bat forward and hits it
the ball sails in a high arc to right center
the center fielder backs up a couple of steps lopes a few strides to his left and makes the catch
archie is out but the runner on third tags up and scores
as archie curls across the diamond from the first baseline to the giants bench he hears cheering
in the stands ray annie karin and mann are giving him a standing ovation
in return he touches the brim of his cap a ballplayers cool response to adulation
look at that
but when archie gets to the bench he cant contain himself anymore
he leaps up and lets out a cheer of pure joy
the game has ended and players are rough housing and joking as they slowly make their way to the door in the outfield fence
ray and mann are talking to some of the players over the fence
where do you go when you walk through that door
what do you do
you cant leave the field any other way can you
not if we want to come back
id love to go with you sometime
the silence that follows is long and ominous
id like to see whats out there
there is still no response
ill take that as a no for now
he spots archie jogging off the field
hey slugger congratulations
archie jogs over
i cant stop shaking im so happy
course i wouldve liked a base hit
but you got a rbi
i sure did didnt i
a rookies luck
they all laugh at that
well come on this calls for a drink
he motions with his head toward the other players disappearing through the outfield door
ray nods understandingly
good game archie
good night kid
ray karin annie and mann watch archie jog towards the rest of the players
when he reaches the fence he turns back to them
ray turns toward him
archie looks as if he knows more than hes saying
thank you for bringing me here
i couldnt have wished for anything more
ray recognizes there may be more behind those words than just a teenagers pleasure
but he decides not to ask any questions
archie runs through the door in the fence and vanishes
mann and karin eat their country breakfasts at one and of the table while at the other end annie and ray sit in front of the bank books ledgers and
the sheaf of bills puffed up around the paper spike
once we fell behind in the payments the full amount of the mortgage became due
and they own the paper so they have the legal right to foreclose
unless we sell
either way we lose the farm
maybe we can make it a condition of the sale that they keep the field up
theyre buying up single farms all around us make it one big farm
first thing theyll do is plow under your field
ray just sits there letting that sink in
ray and mann walking
i dont have a lot of money ray but maybe i could pitch in a little
you can put in twenty bucks for groceries
thats not what i meant
maybe the reason you were supposed to find me was so i could help you with this
more likely its that youre supposed to start writing again
dont change the subject
you promise to publish and ill let you chip in from your royalties
manns expression suddenly turns to one of indignation
one thing has nothing to do with the other
im not sure i agree with that
youre not only stubborn youre stupid
that i wont argue with
annie emerges from the house and calls to ray
honey that was mark
hes coming tonight
he needs a decision tonight
again its j oe jacksons chicago white sox against the new york giants now featuring rookie archie graham
in the stands mann keeps score karin munches on a hot dog and annie and ray snuggle together to watch the game
everything is so perfect here
whatever i have to do to save this place ill do
suddenly ray snaps his head to the side as one does to pick up a distant sound
they look and see marks car heading up the gravel lane
he parks the car at the edge of the field and the game stops as he walks right across it completely mindless of the players
since he doesnt see any of them a few actually have to move out of his way
he approaches the bottom of the bleachers
youre interrupting the game
mark shakes his head sadly at the thought that these otherwise sensible relations have lost their minds
ray its timeto put away our little fantasies and come down to earth
its not a fantasy mark
mark obviously do
esnt see anyone on the field
shoeless joe jackson
the white sox
he cant see any of it
and whos that
ray smiles savoring the moment
as a matter of fact its terence mann
ah how do you
im michael jackson
ray we have to settle this thing right now
im not selling you my home
you have no money youve got a stack of bills to choke a pig and come fall youve got no crop to sell
but i have a deal to offer you that will allow you to stay on this land
this has rays attention
mark climbs the bleachers to stand closer to him
daddy we dont have to sell the farm
but no one pays her any attention
all eyes are on mark
let us buy you out and well leave the house
you can live in it rent free as long as you want
what about the baseball field
do you realize what this land is worth
over an acre
then you must realize we cannot keep a useless baseball diamond in the middle of rich farmland
no deal mark
we dont have to go
youre virtually bankrupt and im offering you a way to keep your home because i love my sister
ive got partners who dont give a damn about you and theyre ready to foreclose right now
daddy we dont have to sell the farm
they all turn to karin
people will come
what people sweetheart
from all over
theyll just decide to take a vacation see and theyll come to iowa city and theyll think its really boring so theyll take a drive
and theyll drive down our road and theyll see the lights and theyll think its really pretty
ray annie and mann listen with wonder to this vision
so the people in the cars
theyll drive up and theyll want to pay us like buying a ticket
mark looks at them all as if theyre crazy
youre not listening to this seriously are you
why would anybody pay money to come here
karin looks at her uncle mark as if he were a simpleton
to watch the game
and itll be just like when they were little kids a long time ago and it was summertime and theyll watch the game and
remember what it was like
ray and annie couldnt be prouder of their daughter than they are right now
what the hell is she talking about
shes talking about people seeing their memories
touching their past
people will come
itll be like one of those tiny french restaurants that have no sign
you find it by instinct
theyll be drawn
okay this is all fascinating but the fact remains that you dont have the money to bring the mortgage up to date so you still have to sell
im sorry but you have no choice
he produces a document and hands it to ray with a pen
ray looks at it
he doesnt know what to do
ray looks at mann
speaks now as he has not spoken for many years as terence mann master of words spellbinder
people will come ray
theyll come to iowa for reasons they cant even fathom
theyll turn up your driveway not knowing for sure why theyre doing it and arrive at your door innocent as children longing for the past
of course we wont mind if you look around youll say
its only twenty dollars per person
and theyll pass over the money without even looking at it
for it is money they have and peace they lack
pushes the papers
just sign the papers ray
is not one to give up
theyll walk out to the bleachers and sit in shirtsleeves in the perfect evening or theyll find they have reserved seats somewhere in the grandstand or along one of the
baselines wherever they sat when they were children and cheered their heroes
theyll watch the game and it will be as if theyd dipped themselves in magic waters
the memories will be so thick theyll have to brush them away from their faces
spellbound ray has put the papers down
mark picks them up again
he is battling mann for rays attention
listen to me
tomorrow morning when the bank opens they will foreclose
people will come ray
youre broke ray
sell now or lose everything
the one constant through all the years ray has been baseball
america has rolled by like an army of steamrollers
its been erased like a blackboard rebuilt and erased again
but baseball has marked the time
this field this game
its a piece of our past
it reminds us of all that once was good
and that could be again
people will come
people will most definitely come
mann has moved everyone but mark with the beauty of his words and the passion in his
behind him the assembled ballplayers respectfully applaud
that was beautiful
the other players nod also teary eyed
the players on either side of him jab his ribs with their elbows but mann ray and annie laugh with pleasure
you will lose everything and you will be evicted
ray looks at the paper with dread
he looks at shoeless joe and the players
he looks at his family
then he turns back to mark
its decision time
im not signing
mark shakes his head sadly
annie hugs ray
the players breathe a great sigh of relief
ray looks up at mann who with a gentle tilt of the head directs rays attention to the house
ray looks behind him toward the house
have parked in front of the house
more are coming quietly down the driveway
dozens of cars
cars with out of state license plates
some people have gotten out of their cars and wait patiently
one or two families sit on their hoods or have set up picnic dinners on their station wagons tailgates
ray annie karin and mann are deeply happy but not terribly surprised to see these people
theyre he re
mark looks at the house and then back at ray
with an edge you dont see those cars
all those people
dont do this you son of a bitch
theres no cars no people
uncle mark i can see them
we all can
youre all bat shit crazy
watch your language mark
you build a baseball field in the middle of nowhere you sit around here and stare at nothing its not nothing
mark grabs karins arm and pulls her to her feet as if she were exhibit a
and youve turned your daughter into a goddamn moron
get your hands off her
ray rises threateningly and mark turns toward him
in so doing he twists little karin off balance
im trying to help you goddamnit
in that split second they hear a strangled gasp and see karin falling forward from the top row of the bleachers
her hot dog flies off the bun and wiener separating in midair
one small sandal bounces end over end and lands at the foot of the bleacher
it takes forever for her body to come down with a sickening thud on the hard green boards of one of the bottom rows
rush down to where she lies face up
ray is first but he does not know what to do
annie and mann hover
mark is horror stricken but no one knows what to do
oh my god im sorry
i didnt mean to
karin is unconscious and seems to be fighting for breath
ray and annies eyes meet in anguish
should we move her
get the car
springs for the house
the tourists by their cars watch quietly
is there a doctor
any of you
they sadly shake their heads no
annie races inside
most of the white sox players stand by the left field fence staring silently
its a twenty minute drive
he knows that could be fatal
ray kneels by karin
her nose and one side of her face have been scraped by the fall
blood starts to trickle from her nose across her cheek and down her neck
she is becoming bluer and her cough is faint as though she is in another room
mark takes off his pale green velvet corduroy jacket and is wordlessly holding it out to ray
ray takes the jacket and covers karin gently
karin is getting paler bluer and her breathing more strained and distant
then without reason ray slowly turns toward the field
the white sox stand near him by the fence the giants stay around their bench
all except one young archie graham
has noticed thecommotion in the bleachers and he starts to lope across the field
annie has pulled the car over and honks
ray holds up his hand to her to wait
his eyes are on young archie graham
as graham gets closer his features begin to change and his step slows
he reaches the end of the fence around which no player can pass and when he emerges from the shadows on the bleachers side he is no longer young moonlight
graham the ballplayer of long ago
but doc graham the old man from chisholm minnesota
his baseball glove has turned into a black doctors bag
as doc graham approaches
what have we got here
doc kneels beside her and instantly knows what is wrong
this childs choking to death
he picks her up with one hand under her shoulders and the other under her knees seats himself on the bleachers and turns her face down
supporting her chest with one hand he delivers a series of sharp blows between her shoulder blades with the heel of his other hand
annie honks again
ray waves her to him
mark cannot believe what he is seeing
suddenly karins diaphragm expands as she sucks in air
doc reaches around and pries her mouth open releasing a sizable piece of hog dog and bun
as he turns her over we can see the blueness disappearing from her face as she continues to breathe deeply
doc peels back each eyelid in turn stares at the pupil for a few seconds and lets the eye close
i dont think the fall really hurt her just the dog in her throat
shell be coming around in a minute or two
thank you doc
doc looks deeply into rays eyes
it just now sinking for ray what doc graham has sacrificed to save the child
ray looks to the field and then back at the doctor
oh my god you cant go back
mark is slack jawed
he has seen something magical happen and cannot explain it
a of a sudden this kid runs off the field and turns
he looks questioningly at annie
she smiles reassuringly
theres hope for you yet mark
doc graham stands and picks up his black bag
well i best be getting back home before alicia starts to thinking ive got a girlfriend
he walks around the edge of the fence and heads for the outfield door
the players respectfully make way for him
good work doc
way to go doc
win one for me someday will you
he passes them
doc graham turns
you were good
only now do doc grahams eyes shine with tears
he smiles and disappears through the door
karin is coming to ray and annie by her side
some of the players start to gather up their equipment
shoeless joe calls to ray
were gonna call it a night
well see you tomorrow
joe starts to trot off the field then he stops and turns back to the bleachers
you wanna come with us
rays jaw drops
you mean it
points to mann him
come with you
what is out there
come find out
wait a second
shoeless joe and the other players wait for mann to join them ignoring rays question
i built this field
you wouldnt be here if it werent for me
ray for gods sake im unattached
youve got a family
this takes ray down a peg or two
but i want to know whats out there
i want to see it
theres a reason they chose me just as there was a reason they chose you to find me
because you big jerk i gave that interview
the one about ebbets field
the one that charged you up and sent you all the way to boston to find me
then you lied to me
you were kidnapping me at the time you asshole
think of it ray maybe theres an ebbets field still floating around out there somewhere
and maybe ill get to sit in the stands and watch a twenty year old kid with a smooth face and kinky hair try out for the dodgers
to shoeless joe so i do all the work and all i get is to see everybody elses dreams come true
is that it
what are you saying ray
im saying im happy for you and im happy for him but after all this whats in it l for me
is that why you did this
theres something out there for me ray
and what a story itll make a man being able to touch the perfect dream
then youll write about it
you bet i will
annie walks karin over
ray bends down to karins face
how you feeling honey
ray laughs and hugs her
he looks up at annie
terrys been invited to go with the players
you mean out
doo doo doo doo
she smiles brightly and gives mann a kiss on the cheek
mann shakes rays hand
i want a full description
you take care of this family ray
mann joins several of the white sox as they leave the field
is absolutely dumbfounded ashe sees the players fade out upon walking through the outfield gate
he turns to annie
you go inside and lie down
ill explain later
mark walks off toward the people in their cars outside the house
whered all these people come from
only a few players are left on the field
were keeping this field
you bet your ass we are
ray realizes shoeless joe is staring at him with a shit eating grin on his face
shoeless joe just keeps smiling
whatre you grinning at you ghost
if you build it
he nods toward where the catcher is taking off his gear at home plate
he will come
ray looks at the catcher
the hairs on the back of his neck begin to stand up
oh my god
what is it
its my father
has taken off his mask
he is in his early twenties
he is in the same pose as the photo we saw in the prologue
ray blanches and turns to shoeless joe his voice a strangled whisper
say it aint so joe
im afraid it is kid
the catcher is now walking toward ray
ease his pain
smiles and nods go the distance
when he says those words shoeless joe sounds just like the voice
it was you
it was you
shoeless joe winks and walks away disappearing through the door in the outfield fence
the catcher is halfway across the field
ray turns to annie
he cannot even swallow
my god i only saw him later when he was worn down by life
look at him
the young catcher has reached the outfield grass
ray walks down to the edge of the outfield
he has his whole life in front of him and im not even a glint in his eye
what do i say to him
introduce him to his granddaughter
ray cannot believe how wonderful annie is
the catcher has reached the edge of the field and now stands before ray and annie
hi i just wanted to thank you folks for putting up the field and letting us play here
im john kinsella
they shake his hand
my wife annie
and this is my daughter karin
karin this is
he almost says my father
ray and annie are beaming
annie takes karins hand
were going to let you two talk
i have to go look after our guests
someones gotta start collecting admission if were going to keep this place
to the catcher very nice meeting you
hoists karin up and totes her toward the tourists waiting in front of the house
watch them for a while then start to stroll across the field
you catch a good game
its so beautiful here
its like well for me its like a dream come true
ray cannot speak
can i ask you something
again ray nods
is this heaven
ray smiles and shakes his head no
i couldve sworn this was heaven
stops and looks intently at john
he asks this question as if he were asking the secret of life
maybe he is
is there a heaven
takes time to answer that
he looks up at the night sky and searches it
then he looks square into rays eyes
heavens where dreams come true
looks toward the house and sees his wife and daughter on the veranda a moon bright as butter silvering the night above them
he finally understands
he turns back to john and nods
then maybe this is heaven
smiles wisely in return
good night ray
john starts to walk off toward the door in the outfield fence
john turns back
ray is holding a ball
you wanna have a catch
john closes his eyes for a second and when he opens them there is the hint of moisture
does he know ray is his son
id like that
ray tosses him the ball picks up a glove lying there and puts it on
they throw the ball back and forth
and as we pull up higher and higher we see a father and son bathed by white floodlights and car headlights
on the silent satiny green of a baseball diamond at the edge of a cornfield
