screenplay by leo marks shooting draft copyright michael powell theatres ltd
copyright leo marks the screen remains dark for a moment
in the darkness we hear the films theme music a gentle whirring purring noise
nothing to be alarmed about
it might be a small contented motor
long shot of the solitary figure of a woman standing professionally alone at the end of the street
it is a bright still night
we can hear the woman whistling stardust merrily to herself
camera tracks around her
a mans footsteps are overlaid
we hear the man start to whistle stardust under his breath haltingly at first then in time with the woman
as we approach she glances at us over her shoulder then turns round for a better look
her whistling stops so at the same moment does the mans
close shot of dora a plump attractive brunette still young enough to need two glances at the customers
she smiles at us and is pleased with the reception
she hesitates for a long moment weighing us up carefully
and then half defiantly half expecting to be laughed at
itll be two quid
evidently we have two quid
she beams with relief throws her fur over her shoulders jerks her head towards the right and sets off
camera tracks after her
overlaid is the sound of the mans footsteps
dora resumes her whistling
so under his breath does the man who is following her
a wider street than the last but just as empty
dora sways her way towards a small house
camera follows at a respectful distance
camera pans from doras hips to an overflowing dustbin
close shot of a mans hand throwing something into the dustbin
it is an empty packet marked kodak film
camera pans to doras house
it stands next to a chemist shop
dora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door glances round at us encouragingly then unlocks the door
she switches on a light and hurries up a flight of stairs
camera tracks after her
she changes her tune to goodnight sweetheart
and so under his breath does the man who is following her
a woman with hair like a two toned car comes down the stairs winks at dora looks at us for a moment with great curiosity
then passes out of camera
dora reaches the landing we are close behind her
dora unlocks the door of her room and goes inside
she switches on the light throws her fur onto a chair lights the gas fire then turns round
close shot of dora
she holds out her hand smiling
there is a gentle whirring purring sound
camera holds on dora she is staring at something with great curiosity
it turns quickly to bewilderment and the bewilderment to fear
she steps back from camera but camera wont have it
dora is now staring at something in horror she opens her mouth to scream a shadow falls across her face
the sound purrs on
the solitary figure of dora standing professionally alone at the end of a street
we see her turn towards camera and smile at us
we are watching her on a mm screen projected in black camera pulls back to show the surround in natural colour
a darkened room in natural colour
the movie screen images are in black and white
we can see the back of a mans head as he bends intently over a projector
he is watching dora on the screen
he is breathing quickly
we see doras hips waggling their way home
the man raises his head so that we cannot see the screen
when he lowers it again we see the woman with the two toned hair winking at dora
then we see dora throwing her fur onto a chair and turning towards us
we see her staring at something in bewilderment
then backing away from camera in fear
we hear the man breathing as if at the end of a very long race
as dora opens her mouth to scream and a shadow falls across her face the title blots out what is happening to her
other credits follow
behind them we can see doras hands pushing something away
before the directors credit it is very dark
close shot of a stack of deck chairs
two forms behind it a mans and a womans
they are intertwined and motionless
suddenly a brilliant shaft of light is trained onto them
overlaid is a gentle whirring sound
camera pans quickly to a nearby tree
close shot of the lens of a cine camera the motor purring
a blinding spotlight
camera pans to the couple the whirring of the camera is overlaid
the man leaps up shielding his eyes against the light
he advances towards the tree
hey you peeping
the spotlight goes out
there is the sound of footsteps running away and the night is at peace again
and now we see who directed the picture
it is standing in the roadway outside doras house
we see it through the finder of a small cine camera
a crowd has gathered outside the house and we are watching them from a corner of the street always through the finder we see several policemen holding back the crowd
as two ambulance men hurry into the house carrying an empty stretcher
gentle whirring sound is overlaid
we see children staring curiously into the empty ambulance and a group of women talking excitedly to a reporter
close shot of a small man looking at us curiously as he approaches filling the screen within the matte
what paper are you from
the finder is lowered
close shot of a young man mark sighting a cine camera
he lowers the camera and turns politely to his interrogator
he seems to have slight difficulty informing his words
i beg your pardon
what paper are you from
mark smiles at him pleasantly
the ambulance men come out of the house carrying the stretcher
there is a body on it covered by a sheet
mark raises his cine camera and photographs them
he photographs the ambulance as it drives off
he photographs the policemen dispersing the crowd
he photographs his interrogator who gladly poses for him
then he slings his camera over his shoulder and strolls away
close shot of dora smiling happily
her photograph is on the front page of a newspaper
above it is a caption brutally murdered
camera pulls back to show sexy magazines alongside the newspaper
mark is staring at a newspaper in the window of a small newsagents shop
he glances distastefully at an array of film magazines showing actresses showing everything then hurries into the shop
a plump bald headed man stares at mark
he turns towards a small door at the end of the shop
quietly hold on mark
mark turns round
peters hesitates drumming his fingers on the counter
close shot of mark
he starts to drum his fingers on a shelf
ive a question for you
he stops drumming his fingers
so at that moment does mark
which magazines sell the most copies
those with girls on the front covers and no front covers on the girls
and its just the same with the work you do for me
overlaid is the sound of the door opening
mark busies himself sorting some newspapers
a whole row of doras smile up at him
camera pans to doorway of the shop
an elderly gentleman is standing there
the times please
and the telegraph
certainly sir anything else
the elderly gentleman hesitates glancing at marks back
have been told by a friend that you
have some views for sale
what sort of views sir
this sort sir
from under the counter he produces a thick book
mark turns round
from his pov we see the elderly gentleman open the book
he er seems er more than a little interested
how much each
five shillings sir
ill take this one
how much would the lot be
to you five pounds sir
the elderly gentleman hesitates
peters turns over a page
and the elderly gentleman almost turns over with it
tell you what sir
four pounds ten and ill throw in the times and telegraph
thank you very much
let me wrap it for you sir
he puts it in a wrapper which says educational books
shall i put you on our mailing list
but ill look in again
by all means sir
he holds open the door for the elderly gentleman and watches him leave
he wont be doing the crossword tonight
he turns triumphantly to mark
counting out money from wallet those pictures he chose
were all yours
handing notes this is yours
mark pockets them without counting them
close shot of mark
in a very different tone and this is yours too
he picks up a postcard holds it towards mark
and thats what i want to talk to you about
its a clever picture because youre a clever lad
pathetically its all face
mark looks at the postcard in silence
i dont want to hurt your feelings son but if people want the mona lisa they go to the national gallery
well wherever they go they dont come here
so no more of this fancy stuff
he pats marks arm
now get upstairs the girls are waiting
and so is a bonus if you give me what i want
thank you sir
amused what do you do with all your money
he opens a door at the far end of the room
we catch a glimpse of a winding staircase
he starts to climb it
at the top of the staircase is a door
mark and his camera trudge towards it
the door opens suddenly
a vivacious young redhead milly pokes her head round
she has a towel round her shoulders
well look whos here
from reverse angle we see mark venture a shy smile at milly
milly opens the door impatiently
come on sonny
make us famous
through the half open door we catch a glimpse of a second girl lorraine
she is staring out of a window her back to camera
she is naked except for a shawl draped round her shoulders
mark enters the room
the door begins to close
camera tracks towards the door
on the threshold of the room a hood is thrown over our faces
the screen blacks out
in the darkness we hear millys voice
did you read about that girl who was murdered last night
we are with mark under the hood of an antiquated camera
through the ground glass of the camera we see a small inverted image of milly
the same thing nearly happened to me
we hear lorraines voice muffled and very far away
i went out with my boyfriend
were getting married next month
trouble was my fiance saw us
the small inverted image of milly peers anxiously into the camera
can you fix it so the bruises dont show
the ground glass camera begins travelling slowly down millys back
close shot of milly
she is on a couch lying on her stomach at a slightly oblique angle
all that we can see are her face and naked shoulders
from millys pov we see mark under the hood of an antiquated camera
well can you
marks voice is muffled under the hood
think so milly
then be quick about it sonny
close shot of her naked toes
they start to wriggle
close shot of marks toes in sandals next to the tripod of the camera
they start to wriggle
close shot of lorraine
we watch her in profile as she stares out of the window clutching her shawl
she has outstandingly beautiful features
close shot of mark
he is standing by the side of the camera studying us thoughtfully
he is holding a remote control switch panel in his hand
he clicks off several lights and then switches several others on
then he ducks back under the hood
there he goes again
what have you got under there
we join mark under the hood
we see a small inverted image of milly on the ground glass
her shoulders are now white and glistening her spine caressed by shadows
she is staring into the camera
i suppose you have a girlfriend
he adjusts the focus
we can see more clearly the contempt on millys face
hear that lorraine
from millys pov we see mark come round to the front of the camera and insert a dark slide
raise your head please and look at the sea
mark presses a rubber bulb the shutter clicks
mark inserts another dark slide
i just wanted that puzzled look
oh did you
well if you want it again ill think of you
from millys viewpoint we see mark holding the rubber bulb
cine camera is on a ledge behind him
youre a puzzle and a half
mark presses the rubber bulb the shutters click
this is a spare time job for you isnt it
he inserts another slide
well what do you do for a living
he presses the bulb the shutters click
he inserts another slide
dont you like this sort
he presses the bulb the shutters click
well what sort do you like
mark looks at her thoughtfully for a long moment
i may show you one day
thatll be a treat im sure
mark smiles at her shyly
thats all milly
oh no sonny
now take one i can show my mother
mark inserts another slide
think of her then
there is a gentle knock at the door and mr
he carries a tray of coffee
he keeps his eyes modestly lowered
on the house
he lays the tray on a table still keeping his eyes lowered and goes out
hope it falls on his ruddy earhole
she glances over her shoulder
its your turn now love
close shot of lorraine staring out of the window
millys voice is overlaid
in a whisper its her first time
lorraine clutches her shawl tightly
come on love
dont be shy
lorraine turns round
the left side of her face is classical in its beauty
she has a hare lip which twists and distorts the whole of the right side
her eyes are large and beautiful and defiant
close shot of mark looking at her
close shot of lorraine
you neednt photograph my face
close shot of mark

close shot of lorraine

close shot of the shawl round lorraines shoulders
close shot of mark
you neednt be shy
its my first time too
close shot of lorraines eyes puzzled
in front of eyes
he tries to go on but words are a foreign language to him
as full of
in a sudden rush lorraine let my camera tell you
close shot of lorraine standing very still looking at him in silence
milly shrugs and reaches for the coffee pot
overlaid is the gentle purring of a cine camera
camera lingers on the dark liquid being poured into a cup
whisky being poured into a glass
the hand filling the glass is a womans mrs
she is sitting in a high backed chair and we cannot see her face
over her shoulder we watch a party in progress
a group of young people have surrounded someone to whom they are singing singing happy birthday to you happy birthday to you camera tracks towards them
close shot of tony hunter a well built youngster in his middle twenties
dear helen he obviously means it
happy birthday to you
close shot of dear helen
a sensitive intelligent and extremely attractive girl who as the encircling youngsters now inform us in song is twenty one today shes twenty one today shes got the key of
the door shes never been twenty one before
close shot of the glass by mrs
it is half empty
an elderly lady leans across to her
she is mrs
partridge slightly high on a glass of sherry
you must be very proud of your daughter mrs
someone switches on a gramophone and the young couples start dancing at once
tony hurries up to helen
helen goes towards him
a young man calls out sharply look
he is pointing at something out of camera
all heads except mrs
stephens follow the direction of his gaze
stephens continues to sit motionless in the high backed chair
camera pans to the window
mark is standing there
close shot of helen looking at mark
we watch him over her shoulder tonys arm encircling it
its that chap from upstairs
the chap from upstairs presses his face to the window
from his pov we see helens eyes looking at him the key of the door in them looking at him not staring
suddenly the rest comes into focus tonys arm around helens shoulder
the high backed chair in the foreground with the back of that motionless head
a young couple giggling as they stare at him
mark steps away and the camera pulls back with him
we catch a glimpse of the house large sprawling but with a touch of quality about it in a quiet unpretentious street
mark hurries towards a side entrance
close shot of helen looking at the empty window
ill ask him in
close shot of tony frowning
camera pans to mrs
the hand which refills it has begun to tremble
the lights are on
we follow mark and his camera along a small passage which leads to the hall
the sound of a dance record can be heard
mark starts to whistle it under his breath
over his shoulder we see a staircase and beyond it the door of helens sitting room
the sound of helens party fills the hall
mark reaches the staircase
there is the sound of a door opening
helens voice is overlaid excuse me
mark hesitates then turns round
close shot of helen smiling at him
i dont know how many times weve passed each other on the stairs
mark looks at her as if he does
but tonight im determined at least to say hello to you
her directness is natural consistent and very hard to resist
close shot of mark smiling
im helen stephens
she glances with unconcealed interest at the camera over his shoulder
im having a party and the other tenants are there
and a few friends
wed like you to join us
she holds out her hand
he takes it gently
please come in
youll meet the others who live here and
thank you but
she glances again at his camera
well i hope to keep it going for hours yet
so when youve finished why not look in
she realizes that this is not the happiest of phrases
camera pans to helens door
tony stands there
darling your cake everyones waiting
close shot of mark looking at her
he turns away
he hurries up the stairs
close shot of helen
she stares after him for a moment
then returns thoughtfully to her party
the screen remains dark for a moment
we are with mark in a darkened room
he is giving a film show and we are the screen
his cine projector points straight at us
a flickering light shines in our eyes
we can see him crouching behind the projector
mark leans forward watching the screen intently
perspiration trickles down his forehead
he is breathing very quickly
the sounds of the party seep up from downstairs music laughter and a girls yelp
there is a knock on the door
mark does not hear it
camera pans to the door of the room
it is blacked out like a photographic dark room
the knock is repeated
close shot of mark
he switches off the projector instantly
camera pans to an open cupboard in the corner
close shot of the shelves
they are stacked with spools of film
camera travels slowly over these spools
we see marks hand add two more to the collection his voice is overlaid
he closes the cupboard door
mark comes out of the dark room behind him the light is kept out by a baffle and a curtain
he has a pleasant normally untidy bedsitting room
he wipes his handkerchief across his forehead then hurries to the door
he opens it helen is standing there
i hope im not disturbing you
close shot of mark shaking his head smiling shyly
close shot of helen
i knew you wouldnt come down

she holds out a plate on which is a piece of birthday cake
he takes the plate
i mustnt keep you from your work she turns to go
id like to offer you a drink
she turns round

i havent one
id adore some water
a hostess cant drink water at her own party it looks like a hint to the guests
like to come in
she steps over the threshold
the door closes behind her
close shot of helen looking round the room
marks voice is overlaid
if youd like some
if you can spare it
helen glances towards the inner room
he holds out a glass of milk to her
thank you mark
she drinks it with relish
he watches her in silence
this is a pleasant room
and youve another inside
how long have you lived here
all my life
she looks at him in surprise
i was born in this house oh
close shot of mark
its my fathers

im the landlord
she looks at him in astonishment
but you walk about as if you havent paid the rent
close shot of mark
its his house and ill never sell it
but i cant afford the upkeep so i let rooms
he looks at her anxiously
if i charge too much tell me and ill tell the agents
the rents very reasonable but dont say anything to the others or youll have no peace
close shot of helen
mark what do you do
slowly most of the time i work in a film studio

to do with photography
when i came in were you looking at some films

he looks at her in silence

but i really would like to see them
it would be a birthday present
from you to me
but i suppose youre too busy
she puts down the glass turns to the door
like to see them now
she turns round
he is standing by the entrance to the inner room
he leads the way she follows
for a moment the screen is in darkness
a dark room darkness
we can hear faintly the dance music from downstairs
there is a click and the walls are suddenly bathed in diffused light throwing the room into delicate shadow
close shot of helen looking round in amazement
as certain events of possible interest are to take place in this room here in detail is what amazes helen
the room is the product of three rooms which have been knocked into one
it is very large and extremely well constructed as we are soon to learn it was originally a laboratory
one half of the room is used for processing and the other half for filming and for trade shows
the two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched all shapes and sizes of cameras their spectacles glinting in the light
in the processing half two benches a dry bench and a wet bench face each other against opposite walls
there are three sinks above the wet bench and an outburst of equipment above the dry
this part of the room is lit by two dark room lamps frowning in the ceiling above the benches
the other part of the room has a window at the far end of it
heavy drapes are putted across it
marks projector rests on a small table in front of the mm screen
two banks of floods and a variety of spots light this part of the room
there is a small control panel on the wall
some of the equipment is ancient but none of it is old
all of it glistens with the affection of its owner
there is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone except an adult
the kind who starts to wonder who paid for it all
close shot of mark
he stands by the lighting panel watching helen
from his pov we see her brushing the hair out of her eyes as she looks slowly round
he brushes the hair out of his
for a moment she turns her back to him
he presses a switch on the wall
a gentle light ripples through the back of helens hair
shot of helen
she turns to him
she is very nearly at a loss for words
this is so
well so many things
but above all its so
she takes a final look round
she looks at him searchingly
is all of it yours
is it designed by you
furnished by you
tell me about this room
close shot of mark
it belonged to my father what was he
then this equipment was his
sold his to buy it
but it seems to be so
she looks at him with renewed interest
if this is where you work i cant wait to see what you work at
close shot of mark in difficulties
dont know what to show you
what were you looking at when i interrupted you
he looks at her thoughtfully
he crosses to the corner cupboard opens the door
close shot of the cupboard
we see marks hand reach for a spool of film
then hesitate poised above another spool
close shot of helen watching with interest
reverse angle shot of mark
he closes the cupboard and turns round
there is a spool of film in his hand
he walks slowly towards his projector
he seems for the moment to have forgotten she is there
close shot of helen watching him thread the film into the projector
this is the first
twenty first birthday present
ill ever have given
its the first ive ever asked for
he places a chair a few feet away from the screen and with an oddly courteous bow beckons her into it
she sits down
close shot of mark
he looks at her intently for a moment then turns off the lights
over helens shoulder we can just make out the empty screen
mark switches on the projector
close shot of helen the light flickering on her face
close shot of mark staring at helens face
close shot of helen
we see her expression of surprise
over marks shoulder we see the surprise growing
over helens shoulder we see the screen
we are looking at a small boy
he is lying in his bed asleep
although the print is old we can see that he is a remarkably handsome boy
mark what a beautiful child
the boy turns restlessly in his sleep
one of his pillows falls to the floor
who is he
me of course it is
then who took this film
quietly my father
a light as if from a small torch starts to shine on the childs eyes
he moves restlessly
what a wonderful idea
the light plays on the childs left eye then on his right
it is growing brighter
youll be able to show it to your own chi
the child wakes up suddenly
he stares at something
then starts to scream
you must have had a bad dream
close shot of mark watching her in silence
but what was that light
the camera i suppose
mark does not answer
the small screen is filled with the face of the screaming terrified child
marks father now tries a not altogether successful dissolve we now see the little boy standing in front of a garden wall
he tries hard to climb to the top of the wall but falls over
mark watches her in silence
small mark tries again and again to scale the wall
at last he succeeds
whatever are you after
we see the little boy lying flat on the wall staring at something
the cine camera which is taking this picture now tracks rather clumsily towards the wall
high angle shot over the wall of what is fascinating young mark a man and woman are lying on the ground kissing
the cine camera pans again rather clumsily to young mark
naughty boy i hope you were spanked
close shot of helen
it suddenly occurs to her
what a strange thing for your father to photograph
she stares again at that lonely figure perched on the wall
the small screen begins to dissolve
so does the large one
stephens shoulder we see the party in progress
the glass by her side is full again
tony is dancing with an attractive blonde
he turns round
the head nods
tony advances reluctantly towards her
reverse angle shot of mrs
over tonys shoulder we see a powerfully built and once lovely woman
she is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober
the few movements she makes are slow deliberate and give nothing away
the voice articulates so carefully that the slur scarcely shows
the fact that she is blind almost helps to conceal the fact that she is drunk
her sightless eyes stare out the camera as tony reaches her
i want a word with you
close shot of helens eyes
the light from the projector flickering into them
i hate people who chatter in films but theres so much i want to ask
she is leaning forward her face cupped in her hand watching the small screen intently
close shot of mark
his face is cupped in his hand as he watches her intently
over helens shoulder we see mark in the making
the child is again asleep
this time he is being photographed from the head of the bed the camera pointing a beam of light starts to shine onto his eyes first onto the left then
onto the right
in a whisper again
mark looks at her in silence
the boy moves restlessly then turns over onto his face pulling the bedclothes round him
his right hand is limp on the pillow
the light shines for a moment on this hand then goes out
helen half turns towards mark
mark this isnt some kind of jo
her attention is suddenly riveted on the screen
in a whisper no helen
over helens shoulder we see something drop onto the childs bed
something which stays quite still for a moment then starts crawling towards the counterpane
it is a small lizard
mark whatever is that
her voice trails away
she stares repelled and fascinated at the screen
we see mark reach for his cine camera
over helens shoulder we see the lizard reach the counterpane
it stretches itself out on the floral design its body is pointed towards the childs hand
we hear a click and suddenly a spotlight falls onto helens face
overlaid is the gentle purring of marks cine camera
she wheels towards him blotting out the small screen
what are you
wanted to photograph you
the camera purrs on
he switches off the spot
the purring of the camera dies away
she turns towards the small screen
help me to understand this
the small boy is sitting upright
screaming with terror
there is no sign of the lizard
a handkerchief is thrown onto the boys bed
he continues crying looking up into someones face
close shot of mark watching the screen
we hear a mans deep voice overlaid
thatll do mark
dry your eyes and stop being silly
small mark reaches for the handkerchief and wipes his eyes
his hands are trembling
the small screen trembles with them into a clumsy dissolve
helen turns to mark
mark what was all that about
he looks at her helplessly
that was a lizard wasnt it
well how did it get there
how did it get there mark
was it a pet
wont you try to explain
close shot of mark staring at the screen
youd better go
i like to understand what im shown
she turns to the screen
what was your father trying to do
photographing you at nigh
her voice trails away
from helens pov we see the screen
small mark is wearing a dark suit and a black tie
he is standing at the foot of a four poster bed staring at something in horror and disbelief
his hands clasp the bedrail tightly
slowly very slowly he walks towards the head of the bed staring
his lips begin to quiver
he bends forward over the bed
we can see the back of his bowed head
what is this
i am saying
we catch a glimpse of a womans hands folded in front of her
close shot of helen
in a whisper he
close shot of mark
suddenly and healthily his temper snaps
he pushes a lever on his projector as far forward as it will go
the film is now shown at tremendous speed we catch a glimpse of a long line of cars
it speeds by
a confused picture of earth and flowers
the briefest glimpse of a little boy with a spade
we see a girl in a bikini by sand dunes
mark offers no comment
mark who is that
close shot of helen
he married her
six weeks after
the previous sequence
he pulls back the lever of his projector
the film returns to its normal speed
we see the same attractive young woman standing in a garden
she is holding a bewildered and defiant mark by the hand
suddenly the girl runs towards camera leaving mark standing alone
what comes now
close shot of helen watching intently
its out of focus
from helens pov we see a tall man in a black coat walking away from camera
he hurries towards small mark who watches him anxiously
is that your father
the morning that he left for his honeymoon
the back of marks father suddenly obscures our view of small mark
all we can see is that tall figure looking downwards standing very still
camera wobbles as if the person holding it is laughing
what is he doing
giving me a present
what was it
mark stares at the blurred screen perspiration trickling down his forehead
cant you guess
the small screen comes back into focus and suddenly our camera rushes towards it
we see a close shot of a close shot and at the moment we see it marks voice is overlaid
a whisper which echoes round the room
we are looking at a close shot of a camera in a small boys hands
there is a single shrill chord of music on the sound track
close shot of the shelf which encircles marks room
we are looking at the very same camera which the small boy is holding
close shot of the camera in small marks hands
his fathers finger points lo the view finder
small mark stares into it
small mark begins to smile
close shot of mark watching himself being born
close shot of helen watching mark
switch it off
he continues to stare at the screen
switch it off mark
she turns to the projector touches the wrong switch
small mark and his father go rapidly backwards
mark turns off the projector abruptly
the room is in darkness
we can hear both of them breathing quickly
the light goes on
mark is standing by the exit he keeps his face averted
helen walks slowly towards the exit
she glances round once over her shoulder then goes into the other room
mark stares after her
she walks towards the door
turns round suddenly almost in anger
so he was a scientist
he keeps his face averted
what kind of scientist mark
what was he trying to do to you
he doesnt answer
he turns round slowly
from his pov we see the willingness to understand on her face
what was he trying to do to you
she walks towards him
takes his handkerchief from his jacket pocket and wipes his forehead
he wanted a record of a growing child
complete in every detail if such a thing were possible and he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me
at all times
close shot of mark
i never knew
the whole of my childhood
one moments privacy
and those lights in your eyes
and that thing
he was interested
in the reactions of the nervous system
close shot of the word fear
we are looking at the spine of a book on marks shelf
the full title reads the physiology of fear by professor a
especially fear in children and how they react to it
close shot of the word fear on the next book
the full title reads fear and the nervous system part i
there is a row of such books all by professor lewis
close shot of mark
i think he learned a lot
id wake up
and hed be there
and im sure good came of it
for some people
he was brilliant
a scientist drops a lizard onto a childs bed and good comes of it
i dont know
if he did
but if he did
hell have learned something of value
if only about lizards
mark it sounds to me as if your father was
he founded clinics
he sounds completely
he was famous
why do you still live in his house
and watch his films

he looks at her in silence
there is a knock on the door
he hurries to the door and opens it
tony is standing there
excuse me but
from tonys pov we see helen looking at the door of the dark room
oh there you are helen
she turns towards him
the party looks like breaking up and we were wondering if
she turns to mark
i wish youd join us
mark shakes his head
i hope that you
she is suddenly aware of tony watching her
she glances at the birthday cake on the table
have a sweet tooth
she smiles at him
for my present
she goes into the passage
good night old boy
he puts his arm round helen and closes the door
mark stares after them motionless
the camera lingers on the birthday cake
as the light fades a voice yells cut
high angle shot of a set showing part of a large west end store
a blonde is lying unconscious in front of a lift and a crowd of extras surround her
as the word cut dies away the extras relax and the blonde diane ashley props herself onto her elbow looking towards the director

he glances at the chief cameraman philip tale who nods his head in agreement
close shot of mark standing at the back of the camera crew
he shakes his head in disagreement
the chief cameraman spots marks small mutiny and wags his finger at him
as the chief cameraman turns away marks finger automatically wags back
close shot of baden looking at his watch
he sighs then nods to the assistant director who stands beside him
all right everyone
back at two
baden walks out without a word to anyone
a hubbub of chatter breaks out
the unit downs tools and begins to disperse
close shot of one of the extras vivian a small vivacious brunette with delicate attractive features
she edges towards the camera crew
close shot of mark watching her
over his shoulder we see vivian glance towards him
he nods almost imperceptibly
vivian hurries towards the exit
mark turns to a shelf behind him picks up his cine camera and a little full string bag containing his lunch
close shot of vivian munching a sandwich
she is leaning against a wall in a corner of an exterior set a chinese temple or a medieval castle or a combination of each like a pinewood drawing room
beside her she has a small tape recorder or record player
we hear music modem rhythms
there are several people strolling about but no one in the immediate vicinity
close shot of mark settling down on the other side of the wall where they can talk without being seen together

mark lies motionless behind the wall
a young male extra comes towards vivian
hallo lousy mornings work wasnt it

mark is silent staring at the sky

she rises to her feet
from behind the wall comes a gentle whirring purring sound
what are you doing
getting into practice
she smiles down at him
see you tonight
see you tonight
she walks away
and the gentle purring continues
camera pans to the sun beating down on the lot
an arc lamp beating down on the set
baden bears down on the assistant director
would you enquire if our leading lady is ready to start leading
a cry goes up miss diane ashley please
miss diane ashley please
close shot of baden turning towards the entrance
close shot of mark turning towards the entrance
close shot of entrance
diane ashley appears
among the many qualities she radiates is goodwill especially towards miss diane ashley
how are you sparks

and so on until how are you phil
close shot of mark
hallo miss ashley
to a figure high in the scaffolding how are you pete
she reaches baden and completely ignores him
darling youve only been playing this part for three weeks so in case you havent yet had a chance to read the script
she ignores this
may i remind you that youre a girl with an irresistible impulse
she looks at him then at her hand and nods
who cannot help stealing
get inside her diane
what in all the world do you most want to steal
well run the scene where you catch sight of the store detective and faint
wheres the girl who plays the bystander
vivian steps forward

close shot of vivian taking her position in front of the lift
she glances at her watch
close shot of mark standing by the side of the studio camera
he glances at his watch
camera tracks towards the lift
from marks pov we see diane catch sight of the store detective and crumple in a faint
hit that floor with a thud
close shot of door marked don jarvis managing director
insists on realism
a timid knock is overlaid before we dare enter
close shot of a pile of scripts on a great mans desk
jarvis is immersed in reading a script
his eyes race across the page
over his shoulder we see what he is reading
a sheet of figures attached to the script
at the same time mr
jarvis is holding a telephone receiver to his ear and we hear an enthusiastic voice filtered its a wonderful subject d
paramount wants it m
wants it columbia wants it
but is it commercial
danny angel wants it
still reading the script mr
jarvis lays the receiver on his desk and picks up another
are those budgets ready
well bring em in
he replaces this receiver and picks up the original
the voice is still talking something about a wonderful part for kenny or alec
send me a memo well discuss it next week
he replaces the receiver
miss simpson enters
she hands him some folders
her smile curtsies
close shot of mr
jarvis opening a folder
over his shoulder we see a page covered with row upon row of figures
the great mans finger skims along the figures like a tailor feeling cloth
theres an error
the total should be a hundred and fifty thousand pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence not thirteen and ninepence
that could mean the difference between profit and loss on a first feature
he glowers at her but his day is made
any units working late tonight
only one sir
night exteriors on the lot
the elephant with two
that animal needs a stick of dynamite
close shot of jarvis
remind me to pay them a visit tonight
she makes a note in her little book

over his shoulder we see an open window
camera tracks towards it
in light of the new economy drive
close shot of clapper boys board
it reads take
he turns to diane who is wearily picking herself up off the floor
just this once

thats it boys and girls

baden puts his arm round dianes shoulder
how are you darling
she makes a hobbling exit
close shot of vivian hurrying towards the exit carrying her little recorder
in a burst of chatter the unit starts to disperse
close shot of mark picking up his cine camera and his lunch bag
the clapper boy comes up to him
catching the bus
for a drink
wanted to discuss the film at the everyman
i hope so
good night mark
close shot of vivian
she is sitting at a dressing room table
making up with care
three other girls share the dressing room with her
there is a knock at the door and the young extra who spoke to vivian in the grounds pokes his head round
lousy afternoons work wasnt it
who wants a lift to town
theres room for two on my lap three at a pinch
which is what wed get
ive a date
at the local

the cars are streaming towards the gate
close shot of baden driving a small new car
close shot of the chief cameraman driving a large old one
he is still immersed in his figures
miss simpson is walking to the door
she glances at her little book
im to remind you to pay a surprise visit tonight to the elephant with
good night d
jarvis goes on reading
close shot of vivian
vivian moves about nervously in front of a mirror in the deserted dressing room
she wears slacks and a shirt
she glances at her watch her hands are trembling looks at watch hears the fireman coming then switches off the music and hides in the big cupboard fireman making his
rounds turning off lights
only a few cars now remain
it is beginning to grow dark
the long corridors are dim and deserted
the fireman is making his rounds
vivian is standing in the cupboard the lights are on
fireman opening the dressing room doors and glancing inside
two electricians are smoking
fireman opens the door of vivians dressing room
from vivians pov we see the lights go out
we hear the sound of the door closing and the firemans footsteps disappearing down the corridor
the great man closing up his folder
glancing at his watch
turning out the light
vivian is hurrying along a deserted corridor
and the little recorder
she pauses and glances out of a door
she carries her case over her shoulder we see the studio lot in a blaze of light we can see a crowd of people hanging about in solar topees and
reverse shot of vivian watching anxiously
she turns away and hurries down the corridor
don jarvis strides across the courtyard
we can almost hear and perhaps we do a cash register ringing up
one of the white clad figures lounging indolently in the doorway glances round sees the inquisition approaching and freezes
his degree of terror might satisfy mark
the great man strides on
vivian pauses in front of the entrance to the set
above the note is a notice no admittance while red light the light is out
vivian looks round there is no one in sight
vivian slips in quietly and closes the door behind her
the set is in darkness
close shot of vivian looking round
in a whisper mark
then edges slowly forward
ahead of her are shadowy counters full of merchandise
beyond them is the door of the lift
close shot of the studio camera and the directors empty chair beside it
close shot of vivian edging forward
she reaches one of the counters and leans against it looking around
reverse angle shot of vivian
she is leaning against the counter of the trunk department
trunks and suitcases at greatly reduced prices are piled behind her
close shot of vivian
she starts whistling nervously under her breath
very faintly overlaid is the sound of mark whistling under his
vivian stops whistling and so does mark
she listens intently for a moment then peers at her watch
close shot of the watch on marks wrist
close shot of vivian
she shivers suddenly
then looks at her watch again
then turns towards the exit and starts to edge back
she trips over a cable and almost falls
suddenly she is bathed in light
she wheels round
one of the big spots is beating down on her
no sign of him
overlaid is a gentle purring sound
where are another light comes on shining through her hair
the sound of his steps is overlaid
his footsteps stop
she looks round
where are you
his voice is quietly overlaid
she wheels round
close shot of mark sitting in the directors chair
he is holding in his lap his cine camera and a black bag
close shot of vivian breathing quickly
you frightened me
he looks at her in silence
theyre working late on the lot
theyre branched off this stage im using their juice
he nods staring at her intently
we must call it off
someones bound to see us
rising slowly but they wont interrupt us while were filming
ive put the red light on
close shot of the red light burning
close shot of vivian
then theyll know someones here
they wont come in
theyll wait outside
whats the difference
the difference is
a perfect film
over his shoulder we see the studio camera
a long time
and so have you
must interrupt it
she glances round at the brazenly burning lights shakes her head despairingly
well be caught
what does that matter
you stand to lose
a job as an extra
i stand to lose
she looks at him in silence
the results must be so perfect
that the risks dont count
close shot of mark
that even he
he hesitates even he
who don jarvis
he looks at her then nods
hed say imitating the great mans voice sign on the dotted line kiddies
you can use my pen but bring your own ink
her excitement is growing mark
if youre sure its worth it
its time to find out viv
he walks slowly towards the studio camera
she prepares for the test by switching on music and warming up with dance movements
she accents the rhythm mark puts the cine camera and the black cloth bag on the dolly slowly mounts the platform closes the blimp and swings the camera
we watch him from the top of the studio from the door of the studio from the directors chair
and finally we watch him from vivians pov
she stops dancing but the music continues
you belong there
he stares ahead of him his mind far far away
then bends and looks into the finder
there is a single harsh chord of music and the screen goes dark
it remains dark for a moment
suddenly the darkness parts like curtains and in the centre we see vivians face in the finder of the studio camera
unlike the ground glass of the newsagents camera we see everything the right way up and in perfect perspective
mark hooks a filler light below the camera and switches it on
he adjusts the finder until he has made of vivians delicate features a radiant miniature
the miniature smiles shyly at him
she has stopped dancing and is looking directly at the camera
i do feel alone in front of it
she hesitates i suppose stars never do
they feel alone without it
he looks in the eyepiece through the film we can see only her eyes large and wistful
and the great ones
all the time
she becomes the uninhibited vivian again
then im great boy
what is it you want me to act
she strikes an attitude a la rabbins he looks up from the camera she smiles and starts keeping time to the rhythm again
being frightened to death
yes and ill have a go
we hear his quick breathing
ive been wondering all the afternoon how youd do it
ill bet youve thought of a wonderful twist
she does a wonderful twist close shot of mark
he looks down a little sadly and peers into the finder
the camera dolly is on tracks he tracks forward
music continues piano
in the finder we see a large trunk at greatly reduced prices on the shelf behind vivian
from vivians pov we see mark leave the studio camera and hurry towards the trunks
she watches him wide eyed
what are you doing
building us a set
he reaches for the largest trunk
why not pull the studio down while youre about it
they can only hang you once
he carries the trunk towards the studio camera and lays it carefully on the floor
vivian peers into the front glass of the studio camera as if it were a mirror
the rhythm of the music changes
if only don jarvis could see me now
she jumps onto the trunk and taps
if only i could see don jarvis now
she giggles again
i warn you mark im hysterical
id rather act dying of laughter if its all the same to you
she jumps off the trunk onto the floor
he opens the trunk
she jumps into it
her laughter echoes round the deserted studio
the two electricians are roaring with laughter
one of them is making tea
so he did it again
now you tell one
camera pans to a dial on the wall
one of the needles flickers slightly
half a mo
one lump or two
as the starlet said to the casting director
he turns away from the dials and grasps at the outstretched mug
close shot of vivian recording her little recorder is twittering back at great speed
to mark over her shoulder what are you doing
she restarts music
she is watching mark curiously as he arranges the lighting
be patient viv
its going to be worth it
close shot of the studio camera
in front of it fixed on a small hook is a tape measure
mark reaches for it
then carefully measures the distance between the trunk and the camera
then he takes apiece of chalk from his pocket and makes a small cross on the floor
the music continues
ive stood alone in front of a studio camera
thats more than most have
he glances at a nearby dial only a few feet away from the one which is flickering
she goes around the camera out of sight and he is out of hers
he glances into the trunk it is deep and very empty
accenting the rhythm i can see you mark
ill bet im the best camerawoman in the business
beating time with her feet mark hurries to the side of the studio camera and picks up his cine camera
ive lost you
ill be back
suddenly marks face appears in the finder
we see mark raise his cine camera
he seems to be pointing it straight at us
we hear a gentle purring
what are you doing
photographing you photographing me
high angle shot of mark standing in front of the studio camera photographing her photographing him
in mock awe mark youre brilliant
he walks slowly towards her holding his cine camera to his eyes
in the finder of marks cine camera we see vivian at the studio camera
she comes closer and closer
lost you again
we see him standing almost on top of her his cine camera trained on her
im ready now viv
she looks up slowly and a little hesitantly
music all drums
go and stand on that cross will you
solemnly yes sir mr
he watches her in silence as she walks to the front of the studio camera and takes up her position
while the drum beat continues
don jarvis is leaving the unit working on the lot
it is now bustling with activity
a girl comes up to him
she raises her cigarette for a light and looks into his eyes
he hands her a box of matches
and walks away
over his shoulder we see the other stages apparently empty
don jarvis hesitates then strides towards one
close shot of a dial the needle flickering slightly
overlaid is the voice of the st electrician
and heres one of the wife and nipper
close shot of vivian staring at the trunk on the floor behind her
the recorded rhythm continues
am i supposed to imagine someone is going to put me in there
mark is watching her over the top of the studio camera
he peers into the viewfinder
in the finder we see vivian looking rather pathetically into camera
mark i hope i wont let you down
i know youre trying to create atmosphere for me but
i just dont feel frightened
wouldnt it be better if i just did my number
shaking head later
oh all right
i could do anything i feel so relaxed and thats due to you
youre so at home with that camera you make me feel at home too
you have it in you boy
from her pov we see see him raise his head slightly
great effort well ill try in the finder we see her wrinkling her brow
frighten me to death
looking appealingly into camera set the mood for me mark
he goes and switches off the recorder
the sudden silence is startling
coming towards you
whos going to kill you regardless of consequences
yes but he knows it
and you dont
and just to kill you
isnt enough for him
but how would he frighten me to
she stares into focusing screen intrigued but not frightened not even by the silence and shadowy vastness around her
stay there viv
she stands motionless staring into camera
close shot of don jarvis
he is standing motionless staring down a corridor
what he is staring at is out of camera and it is puzzling the great man
he walks quietly along the corridor
close shot of vivian
i cant imagine what youve thought of
close shot of mark
he raises his head slowly and locks the studio camera off
then he walks slowly towards her
high angle shot of mark walking towards vivian
camera zooms down to the trunk behind her
marks voice is overlaid suppose this
were one of his weapons
close shot of don jarvis
the great man is poised for the kill
he is moving forward stealthily
and suddenly breaks into a run
camera pans and we see the object of his attentions
a wisp of smoke is coming from behind an alcove
close shot of a fireman smoking a cigarette
close shot of don jarvis smoking
close shot of the firemans terror as he sees don jarvis
smoking on duty
the fireman opens his mouth to explain and smoke exudes
come with me
the fireman follows him meekly
so near yet a lifetime away a red light is burning above a closed door
close shot of vivian puzzled
close shot of mark
he is holding his cine camera fixed to it is a collapsible tripod
suddenly he pulls one leg of the tripod out
we see that a very sharp spike protrudes from the end of it
from marks pov we see vivian looking at the spike
he raises it towards her until the spike is only inches from her throat
that would be frightening
theres something else
we can hear his heart pounding as if it will burst and gradually vivian too becomes aware of it
what is it
just for a moment marks arm moves
his back hides what he is doing
suddenly we see vivian turn her head sharply she is looking at something out of camera
in a whisper that
the spike is very close to her throat but vivian ignores it staring out of camera
over marks shoulder we concentrate on vivians face
in a whisper mark
the fear on her face is rapidly growing
she tries to move back but the trunk prevents her
it is almost a scream
we can hear mark breathing quickly
vivian raises her hands to push something away from her
suddenly the screen is filled with her eyes
we see them dilating with terror
there is a sudden crash as the big power switches go out in the roof
the lights go out
there is a scream in the darkness
the darkness acquires a grey opaque quality as if one is seeing the world through a curtain it is the world of mrs
a bright light is felt rather than seen beating against our eyelids
it looms closer and stronger
and that darling is the end of the news
unless you want the football results
close shot of mrs
stephens a large glass of whisky and the bottle beside her
it is night
no thank you
close shot of helen
shes got the key of the door is overlaid
what else can i read you
the label on this whisky bottle
are you sure it says seventy per cent proof
theyre bigger liars than the press
from helens pov we see her reach for her glass with a steady hand
is that your last tonight
i doubt it
your last but one
producing a coin toss me double or nothing
helen spins the coin on the table mrs
stephens listens intently
the coin stops spinning
her fingers shoot out and feel the surface of the coin
bad luck darling
she turns the coin over and carefully feels the other side
helen watches her with a smile then looks thoughtfully at the ceiling
what are you looking at
wondering if that young man is home
well he is
i heard him come in
four paragraphs ago
from helens pov we see the sightless eyes staring at her
do you like him
close shot of helen
he has a quality
sipping her glass wish this had
and i think he could help me
with your photographs
close shot of mrs
stephens hesitates which is rare
abruptly it doesnt matter
quickly mummy whats worrying you
the price of whisky
what else matters
dont you like mark
havent met him
you dont like him
now why not
close shot of mrs
again she hesitates
i distrust a man who walks quietly
his footsteps arent
are you going up to him
we both have the key of the door
mine needs oiling and yours needs exercise
off you go
she kisses her and glances at the whisky glass
remember that you lost the toss
she walks to the door
if youre back in five minutes
i wont even finish this
she hurries out
stephens instantly refills her glass
close shot of her hand
it has begun to tremble
close shot of marks hands in the green light of the dark room
he is busy unloading and winding film onto a developing rack
he puts the rack of exposed film into the tank and starts the time clock
close shot of the time clock ticking
a knock is heard off
mark looks up
who is it
close shot of mark
faintly overlaid is shes got the key of the door
he looks down at the clock
calling come in helen
helen opens the door of marks sitting room
we hear mark call out from the inner room would you
wait in there
helen goes in closing the door behind her
she speaks loudly to be heard in the dark room
mother heard you come in so i guessed you wouldnt be in bed
no reply from the inner room
are you sure this is conven
wont be long
helen glances at her watch
then looks curiously round the room
close shot of vivians recorder placed on a chair
close shot of helen
she picks it up and looks at it curiously fingering the stops
helen turns round
mark is standing on the threshold of the dark room
he walks towards her
he stops suddenly
he is staring at the recorder in her hand
i hope you dont mind is it a tape recorder
gently he takes it from her as if it is a cup with which she has finished and replaces it on the shelf
close shot of helen
im sure im being a nuisance
but mark i very much want to
her voice trails away
close shot of mark
he is holding out a small package
thats very sweet of you but really
it isnt much
i dont know anything about
presents for twenty one
but i saw it this morning
gently thank you
she takes the package and unwraps it
inside is a slender brooch its beautiful
i like the design
no thank you mark
and i really appreciate this
im going to put it on now
he watches her hold it against her dress
the first place
i think so too
close shot of helen pinning it on
close shot of mark touching his lapel
close shot of helen glancing at her watch
close shot of mark glancing at his
he thinks of the ticking clock in the dark room
helen looks up and sees him
i am keeping you
mark im here for some advice
he looks as if he has just been voted the best cameraman of the year unanimously and the two films he directed have both won oscars though don jarvis understood
his delighted astonishment is such that she has to smile
i work in a public library in the childrens section
im telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me
she takes a deep breath
in my spare time
i write stories for children
but so did grimm
had any published
some short stories
id like to read
i learned today
that my first book
has been accepted
for publication in the spring
but thats wonderful
whats it about
a magic camera and what it photographs
close shot of mark
whatever made you
think of that
ill tell you one day i promise
well what does it photograph
ill tell you that too but mark
this is the problem
the children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes but the publishers say theyre impossible to photograph and suggest drawings
but i dont agree
no nothings impossible
was hoping youd say that
there must be photographs however difficult to take and i was wondering mark if youd
discuss it with me
mark i cant ask you to do that
they have cancelled his oscar
the publishers mightnt agree
id take them
there are some things
which i photograph
i didnt mean to offend you
close shot of mark
if you knew what it meant
for something to happen to me
that i dont have to make happen
youve given me a twenty first birthday
close shot of helen looking at him
what does your camera photograph
mark i must go
i just wanted to know
if youd talk it over with me
thats up to you
i dont know much about
but would you come with me
whats the matter
it had better be soon
are you going away
almost for certain
well you suggest when
are you free
i hope i am
ill understand if youre not
ill try to be ill try my hardest to be
thank you for listening
and for my present
and for mine
they look at each other in silence
good night mark
turning to the door good night
he watches her leave standing very still
offstage the time clock explodes
close shot the excited clock
marks hand silences it
mark opens the developing tank lifts out the rack of film drops it into the fixing bath
he switches light from green to red
close shot green to red dark room lamp
mark lifts the rack of glistening film out of the fixing bath and scans the image
close shot marks face and the tell tale black and white images
close shot the film
a pile of trunks
in the darkness we hear a man enquire softly looking for a trunk
close shot of a tall man with a severe face
he is standing in front of a familiar pile of trunks marked at specially reduced prices
camera pulls back slowly and we see whom he is addressing
it is diane
camera pulls further back and we see that we are in a small theatre watching rushes
camera pans across badens disgruntled face
the chief cameramans bored face
the script girls puzzled face
to dianes expression of rapture as she watches herself on the screen
id like to see that one
from dianes pov we watch the screen
we see the tall man shop assistant reaching for a trunk and laying it on the counter
he opens it with a flourish
vivian passes across the screen glances casually at the trunk and wanders off
no no no we must get some comedy into this
the assistant director nods
well retake it this morning
camera lingers for a moment on the screen as diane on screen smiles at the assistant
she pockets a small item ill take it
the assistant bows and closes the trunk
we dissolve to the set itself the assistant is leaning over the counter listening intently
diane stands in front of the counter receiving the attentions of the make up man
badens voice is overlaid i want some comedy in this scene
the unit is busy preparing for a retake
the studio camera and its crew are off camera and we concentrate on baden briefing his artistes
he is clutching a script as if afraid that opening it might be indecent exposure
instead of taking the first trunk you see i want you darling
to ask for a blue trunk and when he brings it to you to ask for a red one and when he brings that to ask for a white one
turns to the assistant and you michael
get the trunks one by one growing more and more fed up and well end on a gag which ill think of in a minute all right
i dont feel it
dont feel it
hastily positions everyone
over marks shoulder behind the camera we watch the unit taking up positions
anyone seen vivian
the red headed bystander viv
impatiently never mind im cutting her out of this scene
lets run it
shouting quiet everyone
from marks pov we watch the scene being rehearsed
diane approaches the trunk counter and the assistant smiles at her
can i interest you in a trunk
pointing id like to see that one
he turns away
she pockets a small item from the counter
he heaves a trunk forward
its beautifully fitted he opens it she takes a perfunctory glance id like to see one in red
she pockets another item
he turns and wrestles with another trunk
brings it forward and opens it do you have one in white
mark walks away quietly from the back of the camera crew
he hurries to the shelf where he keeps his cine camera and a lunch basket
he reaches for his camera
dianes voice is overlaid
do you have one in blue
mark turns towards the rehearsal and raises his cine camera
we see the assistant try to lift a blue trunk and half collapse with the weight of it
close shot of baden beaming
the assistant manages to drag the trunk forward
he leans over it exhausted then starts to open it
mark moves round until dianes face is in the finder
as the lid of the trunk is opened we can see only her eyes above the rim of the lid
we hear her scream
close shot of baden freezing
there is the sound of a body falling to the ground
the silly bitch
shes fainted in the wrong scene
in the darkness we hear a telephone ringing
and then another
and then another
then they all merge into one big blast
camera tracks quickly towards a door marked publicity the head of publicity has a receiver to his ear
is this a gag
a girl in a trunk
who is she
well which unit
the walls are closing in
what a break for them
i mean what a heartbreak
he is already speaking into another telephone call a press conference
he turns to the original telephone im on my way down
a police car
there are two men seated at the back
chief inspector gregg is reading a file
a plain clothes sergeant miller is seated next to him
the sergeant glances at his chief apprehensively
excuse me chief
we pass my house when we reach the bypass
would you mind if i drop off for a minute
without raising his eyes to collect your kids autograph book
if the nipper hears where ive been
turns to the driver all right dawson anything to help the sergeant
stares down at the folder and its about time the sergeant helped me were getting nowhere with this
over his shoulder we see what he is looking at it is a photograph of dora in her furs and finery
what about that man the landlady passed
she couldnt describe him except to say that he was carrying something that she couldnt see
thats a help
close shot of the inspector staring at the folder
sergeant ive been on the force thirty odd years
and i have never seen such fear on anyones face as on this girls
almost to himself what was it she saw
a man coming at her with a sharp weapon
im familiar with that kind of terror
this is something new to me
the sergeant glances at doras photograph
now take a look at how we found her
he starts to turn the page a door with a sign on it canteen closed today
camera tracks towards it
mark is sitting by an open window at the far end of the canteen
his cine camera and lunch basket are by his side
from marks pov we see that the unit with the exception of diane and baden is crowded into the canteen
they have formed themselves into small groups and are talking in whispers
the assistant director is standing with his back to the door
a girl calls out how much longer must we wait in here
till the police arrive
mark glances at a group in the comer
the trunk assistant is encircled by eager listeners
and when she opened that trunk
and i saw what was inside
my dears i nearly fainted with her he runs a delicate hand across a delicate forehead and do you know what horrified me most
says not to discuss it
any more sauce from d
and i shall refuse to sign for seven years
that poor girls expression
mark glances out of the window
from his pov we see a police car driving across the courtyard
mark watches with great interest then reaches for his cine camera
he photographs the police then puts his cine camera on to the table and sits back
camera lingers for a moment on the folded tripod
the set is completely deserted
it is lit by a single lamp
a solitary trunk stands on the counter its lid closed
we see don jarvis enter followed by the two policemen
baden and the publicity man bring up the rear
don jarvis points towards the trunks department
the chief inspector nods then he and the sergeant approach the counter
carefully the inspector raises the lid of the trunk he looks inside
close shot of the inspector over the top of the lid
his expression is mainly one of surprise
close shot of the sergeant staring into the trunk
he is also surprised but there is nausea in his face
they look up at almost the same moment
their eyes meet
in a whisper chief its exactly the
he closes the trunk quickly
quietly dont say anything
he faces don jarvis well sir
we shall probably have to interview everyone at the studio so wed better plan a campaign that wont interfere too much with your productions
warming to him at once thank you chief inspector
if you knew what even a single days delay could cost
oh we do sir
his eyes are on the trunk close shot of mark
he is looking out of the window his camera at the ready
overlaid is the sound of a door opening
the buzz of conversation dies away
we hear don jarvis voice
if i may have your attention please
a hand tugs at marks elbow
he turns round
the clapper boy looks at him waringly
from marks pov we see don jarvis standing in the doorway facing a suddenly hushed room
the great mans hands are folded in front of him the police wish to interview each of you individually
after which you will be at liberty to leave
s pov we see the upturned faces the light from the window falls upon mark listening to him with rapt attention
marks hands are folded in front of him
there will of course be no shooting today
but work will be resumed as usual tomorrow
with i hope all of you present
close shot of don jarvis
i look to you to give the police your fullest cooperation
he turns abruptly and leaves sergeant miller enters with a smile
lets get ourselves organized
taking a piece of paper from his pocket we dont want to keep you cooped up in here so weve worked out a timetable
well talk to the artists first then the technicians in this order
mark reaches for his cine camera
a series of brief shots of the unit being interviewed by the police
the young extra who spoke to vivian in the exterior set points excitedly to the wall where vivian and mark lay
the inspector and sergeant carefully examine both sides of the wall
the inspector stoops picks up something with a pair of tweezers and puts it in an envelope
a few passers by look on from a distance
one of them is watching through his cine camera
the young extra who shared vivians dressing room is talking to the chief inspector and sergeant
she said she didnt want a lift because she had a call to make locally
did she say where
and when i left she was still in the dressing room
lets have a look at this dressing room shall we
the policemen and the extra are walking away from camera down a passage
a few members of other units pass them by without a glance
one of these a girl smiles into camera
the girl walks out of picture
the camera and mark track after the policemen
as the inspector opens the door of the dressing room mark hurries past
he raises his cine camera and photographs the sergeant
the sergeant turns to close the door
he sees mark
straightens his tie and looks as severe as he can
hey i dont think you ought to do that
he hurries down the passage
turning round do what
make me famous
some chap was giving me a screen test the extras voice is overlaid a hint of hysteria in it
thats where she sat
the inspector turns away and the sergeant closes the door
the door of the small office opens and the chief cameraman comes out
on a bench at the end of the passage mark the clapper boy and a member of the camera crew are waiting
and whoever did it must be
the crew member hurries into the office and closes the door
the chief cameraman wanders off thoughtfully
mark and the clapper boy are left sitting side by side
ive been watching you

yes ive a few quite interesting shots of them its a chance i never expected
a chance for what
or as much of it as i can
what on earth for

id rather not tell you till its finished
and it soon will be
but suppose they catch you
oh they will they look very efficient

but they might confiscate your camera
im afraid they will
but by then
ill have finished with it
the door of the small room opens and the crew member comes out
he rises slowly
the cine camera is over his shoulder
mark hadnt you better leave that with me
id look after it
im sure of that but id like to photograph them while theyre questioning me
the clapper boy looks at him in amazement
i dont suppose theyll let me
mark are you potty
yes do you think theyll notice
the clapper boy laughs
dont get into any trouble for heavens sake i want to discuss that film at the everyman
id like that
he walks slowly towards the door
the clapper boy takes out a copy of sight and sound and starts to read it
the inspector is seated at a desk reading some notes
the sergeant is seated by the side of the desk a pile of papers in front of him
there is a gentle knock on the door
the sergeant glances at a list
mark lewis focus puller
whatever that may be
the inspector nods
he puts a tick on the list
there is the sound of a door opening
the inspector looks up
from his pov we see a young man with a camera over his shoulder advancing shyly towards him
im chief inspector gregg and this is sergeant miller
grab a chair
the sergeant glances up
ive brought the camera in case you want to take the film away
he holds out his camera
the sergeant glances enquiringly at the inspector

the doctors finished his examin
the inspector rises at once

mark stands very still

id probably end on location
ill take you there sir
he opens the door thanks
he glances at the sergeant carry on with the interviews sergeant
from the sergeants pov we see mark turn to go into the passage
the sergeant stares at the camera on his shoulder
then the door closes
the sergeant makes a note on a piece of paper
the inspector and mark walk side by side along the passage
the clapper boy comes into view still reading sight and sound
the clapper boy glances up just in time to see the inspector and mark walk side by side to the end of the corridor
staring after them i warned him to be careful
a constable is standing outside the entrance to the set
from his pov we see the inspector and mark approach
the constable stiffens
from marks pov we see the constable barring the entrance
i think i can find my way now
thanks for the escort the inspector hurries towards the door of the set
the constable opens it and the inspector goes inside
the constable closes the door and stands in front of it
mark turns away quickly
the carpark is jammed with cars but there is hardly anyone in sight
mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of stage e they are a few feet apart
he looks round carefully then slips inside
facing mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom
beyond this is another set also in darkness and beyond this yet another
only in the far comer of the studio in the furthermost set is there a light burning
voices can faintly be heard coming from this set
mark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to the gantry
carefully rung by rung he starts to climb the ladder
at the top of the ladder is a gallery
mark moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above the policemen
mark raises his head cautiously and looks down
far below we can see the inspector standing next to the doctor a tall silver haired man who is peering into an open trunk
detectives are photographing the set
mark raises his cine camera
its gentle purring seems to echo round the studio
close shot of marks jacket pocket
a row of pencils is sticking out
as he leans forward the pencils tilt
through the finder matte of marks camera we see the inspector very far away peering into the trunk and nodding
a faint echo of conversation is overlaid
no doubt at all
wounds were caused by the same instrument
mark changes lens and alters the finder to a mm lens
the doctors face thin and impersonal appears in the finder over the lid of the trunk
subjected to the most violent shock
what sort of shock
still cannot determine but look
he points to something in the trunk out of the cameras eye line
close shot of mark
he balances carefully then raises the camera above his head
as he leans forward the pencils fall
we see them shooting like small torpedoes into the darkness below
they make three separate landings
close shot of the inspector
from his pov we see tiers of scaffolding deep in shadow
the detectives make as much noise to become quiet as the normal occupants of the studio and then there is complete silence
complete except for the doctors asthmatic breathing
and then so gently that it might almost be in our own minds we hear a purring sound from the shadows above
the inspector listens intently
i thought i heard a putty cat
there is a burst of laughter the inspector frowns
i dont want to spoil anyones fun but we do have a maniac on our hands and if we dont get him quickly therell be a third unsolved murder to
report to the commissioner
so lets hurry things up shall we
the putty cat detective raises his flashlamp towards the trunk counter
in the brilliant flash of light that ensues we glimpse a shadowy figure moving towards a ladder high in the scaffolding
but then we are looking for it no one else is
the flashlight dies away
the scene fades with it
close shot of a knitting needle held upwards
another knitting needle scales down it like a fireman descending a ladder
stephens is doing her knitting
the inevitable glass stands on the table beside her
helen is seated opposite reading from a newspaper
she was appearing in arthur badens new film the walls are closing in starring diane ashley
close shot of mrs
stephens listening intently
a spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise that her role was to have been built up
all work at the studio ceased today as a tribute to her memory
stephens sips from her glass
the prime minister to visit athens
mark is in films isnt he
it is reliably
i wonder if he knew her
close shot of helen looking up
ill ask him tonight

which studio does he work at
ill ask him

behind her back we see that her fingers are crossed
ill bring him in and introduce you if
i feel i know him
now how can you
stephens stiffens suddenly
close shot of the window
mark is standing outside looking in
why dont we make him a present of the window
he practically lives there
helen beckons to mark to come in
we see him nod eagerly and leave the window
how did you know where he was standing
the back of my neck told me
the part that i talk out of
helen hurries to the door of the sitting room
mark closes the front door behind him
from his pov we see the door of helens sitting room open and she stands on the threshold
so am i
id like you to come in for a moment and meet my mother
she holds open the door
he goes inside
the screen suddenly greys out into the veiled images of mrs
we hear helens voice
darling this is mark
mark my mother
we hear the sound of footsteps shuffling shyly forward and then marks voice every intake of breath magnified
how do you do
we hear the pounding of someones heart and then mrs
as her voice dies away
close shot of marks hand clasping mrs
close shot of mark looking at her fascinated
from marks pov we see the sightless eyes turned towards his
stephens other hand gently feels the surface of his
have you been running young man
he hesitates didnt want to be late for helen
thank you mark you deserve a drink for that
what would you like
nothing thank you
stephens grunts and reaches for her glass
darling ive left your supper in the
tell me young man
which studio do you work at
the screen greys out
we hear marks tiny intake of breath
and that poor girl
where did she work
someones heart is pounding fast
we were wondering if you knew her
no no i didnt
i do like first hand information
we hear marks small attempt at a laugh
oh well i mustnt keep you gossiping after youve run all the way from where
again that little intake of breath
stephens and mark are staring at each other as if she has sight and he hasnt
from helens pov we can see only marks back and her mothers upturned face
darling may i tell you about your supper
go and be told about yours
she takes marks hand goodbye mark
i expect we shall meet again
i hope so goodbye
he turns to the door close shot of helen kissing her mother and whispering into her ear
darling we forgot to toss
suppers laid out in the kitchen
if youre not back early youll find me laid out with it
well be early
good night darling
mark holds the door open for helen and she goes into the passage
mark turns and takes a long look at mrs
she is in the middle of raising her glass
she stops suddenly the glass poised mid air
he goes out closing the door
she finishes her drink as if it is her last
helen is waiting by the door
from her pov we see mark coming eagerly towards her his camera over his shoulder
i want to ask you something rather personal
he looks at her anxiously
how long is it since youve gone out without that
close shot of mark
dont think i know
ive never seen you without it
but are you going to need it tonight
he looks at her in silence
well are you
and if so
shall i bring some work with me too
im not going to need it tonight
good then give it to me
she holds out her hand
he looks at her appalled
itll be quite safe ill put it away for you
in a whisper no
then take it upstairs if you cant trust me with it
close shot of mark
i trust you
she opens the door of her bedroom and turns on the light
lets put it in here
she crosses to a cupboard and unlocks it then turns round
he is standing hesitantly on the threshold
come in and see for yourself
he looks slowly round the room stares for a moment at the bed in the comer but he wont cross the threshold
he stays outside
well put it in here and lock it
was my mothers room
was it mark
again he stares at the bed
i am being tactless arent i
its just that
i thought it was growing into an extra limb and but you bring it with you if you want to
he takes off his camera and holds it out to her
she takes it from him puts it into the cupboard and locks it
then offers him the key
close shot of mark
cant describe it
could only photograph it she laughs
shall i tell you what i feel
they hurry towards the door
they walk down the steps of the house
theres a small place round the corner
its awfully good on christmas day
there arent too many open then
no it sounds fun
close shot of mark and helen walking along by the side of the house
i adore new restaurants
suddenly mark stands motionless
he is staring at something off camera
especially when her voice trails away
she is staring at mark staring at something
in the shadows at the mouth of an alley a young couple are kissing
mark stands motionless staring at them
automatically his hand reaches for his camera
helen starts to speak then looks at him in silence
the man glances round
mark hurries away and helen stares after him
close shot of mark
he turns back waiting for helen
from his pov we see helen come slowly towards him
she looks at him searchingly for a long moment
he manages but only just to meet her eyes
where is this restaurant
round the corner
know much about films
come on then
close shot of mark
they walk slowly down the street
close shot of mrs
sorry young man helens out
tony is standing unhappily opposite mrs
with mark from upstairs
you can stay and talk to me if you like
know much about films
or film studios
wheres chipperfield studios
chipperfield i suppose
theres a phone book outside
look up the number will you
and see if you can get it
and then i must go to my room
she lifts her glass and sits waiting as he crosses the room
a small and very pleasant restaurant almost full
helen and mark have a corner table
they are dining by candlelight and there is a bottle of wine in the middle of the table
as camera tracks towards them helen is laughing
i like this place
and this dinner
close shot of mark
he has again won the academy award
thank you mark
are you ready to talk about your book
im ready to talk about you
his face falls
it wont take a second and its best to have it said
carrying a camera is only one of your habits isnt it mark
he looks at her in silence
close shot of helen
when you stared at that couple you were like the little boy on that film you showed me
looking over the wall at something he shouldnt see
but mark youre strong enough now to lift that child off the wall
ill try to be
will you mark
will you really
when your books published will you go on working in a library
in case one day a child comes in and asks for it
ill come in
im not popular with my customers
they ask me for horror comics and i take their sticky hands and drag them to where there are books
close shot of helen
and do you know mark waiting for them to come in next time and ask for books
is as exciting
as a horror comic
what does your magic camera photograph
its owned by a little boy who is terrified of grown ups
but when he looks in his magic camera he sees grown ups as they were when they were children
and he isnt frightened any longer
close shot of mark listening engrossed
and one day he gives his camera away to a little boy who is even more frightened of grown ups than he was and do you know what he finds
the little boy opposite her shakes his head
that when he looks at grown ups without his camera he can still see them as they were when they were children
and that means that hes grown up himself
a moments pause
she drinks her wine shy awaiting his reaction
what made you think of this story
close shot of mark
i looked out of my window and saw you going off to work carrying that camera like a little boy with a satchel
and an idea came
so thank you
id like to think
i was responsible
in some way
now what do i do about the photographs
he slams the table so violently that a lady nearby looks around
then reaches for his camera
there isnt a single face that doesnt look like a childs not a single one if you catch it at the right moment
he turns around excitedly and sees her watching him
it would be a challenge
unlike anything ive photographed
what have you photographed mark
but nothing id want children to see
she looks at him curiously
but this would belong to them and theyd know if it wasnt right
i would like to find those faces for you
he laughs excitedly
she looks regretfully at her watch
at once he looks at his
you made a promise to your mother gently yes mark
youd better keep it
he signals to the head waiter
and pays his first bill for two
they walk along the street very close together but not quite touching
above them a light is shining on a blind revealing a shadow of a woman undressing
mark glances at the blind then looks away quickly
he stares ahead of him
and continues to stare ahead of him
suddenly helen tucks her arm through his and smiles up at him
they walk on in silence
helen and mark come in quietly and close the door
she glances round the dimly lit hall
there is no light under any of the doors except one at the end of the passage
mother must have gone to bed
she turns to find him looking at her mark it was a wonderful evening
thats what i was going to say
a wonderful evening
gently and you made it wonderful
without your camera
a shadow passes over his face
gently ill get it for you
he stands motionless as she goes into her room
from his pov we see the half opened door and the bed in the comer
close shot of mark forcing himself to look away
helen reappears on the threshold the camera in her hand
he looks down at it then slowly stretches out his hand
wonder how this sees grown ups
she turns the camera round me for instance
now that i am one
she looks at herself in the lens not you
he takes the camera from her mark
it never will
whatever i photograph yes
i always lose
i dont understand
the door at the end of the passage opens and tony emerges in his dressing gown carrying a towel
he avoids looking at them goes into the bathroom opposite and slams the door
hell wake mother
there is the sound of running water
thank you again for my evening
she is standing very close to him smiling up into his face will you go to bed now and not stop up watching those films
ive a little work to do
then ill go to bed
and think of how to find faces for you
he looks down at the face which he has found for himself
she raises her head slowly
faces which are faces which
she kisses him very gently on the mouth
the bathroom begins to sound like a small waterfall
good night mark
he watches her as she goes into the room and doses the door
a light goes on beneath the door
he stands very still for a moment
then turns the camera round and points the lens towards his lips
then he turns abruptly and hurries up the stairs
the waterfall cascades on
the screen grows dark and the dark room grows out of it
the big drying drum is turning feeding the dry print into a box
a small motor drives it
close shot of the box
mark is spooling up the film as it comes off the drier
once or twice he cant help glancing at an image
close up of vivians face in the image
mark stops the motor and the drum loosens the end of the film spools up with a snap slides the spool off and hurries out with it
mark hurries to his projector threads the film and starts the projector
he flicks it on as if it were a gramophone then looks eagerly at the mm screen
behind him something moves in the shadows reverse shot of mark
over the shoulder of someone who is standing deep in the shadows we see mark
his head obscures what he is watching on the screen
from marks pov we see the processing sinks deep in shadow
he starts to move towards them then suddenly stares at the shadows at the back of the room
silence except for the whirring of the mm projector
close shot of marks hand switching on the light
mark turns round
he is as astonished at what he sees as he can be
camera pans in its own good time to the back of the room
stephens is standing in the shadows
a heavy hand rests on a heavy stick
the sightless eyes stare unerringly towards the light switch
good evening mark
how did you
the young man bathing himself brought me to your door
i managed the rest of the adventure alone
he stands motionless staring at her standing motionless
above her head an ancient half blind camera also stares at her
the only movement in the room is her smile
this is one room i expected to find locked
i was never allowed a key
cant get used to them
stephens sightless eyes stare at him
i brought her home early
close shot of her hand tightening on the heavy stick
is there something you
next door would be more
im at home here
i visit this room every night
the blind always live in the rooms they live under
every night you pace for hours above my head
ive no one to talk to
in the rooms i live over
her hand touches the black cloth loading bag lying on the table
im told that you stare too much
so do i
close shot of her hand touching the black cloth bag
close shot of mark walking slowly towards her
at once she raises the heavy stick pointing it towards him
close shot of the stick
it is a shooting stick with a sharp spike on the end of it similar to the tripod on marks camera
mark stares at the stick fascinated
close shot of mrs
stephens exploring the inside of the black cloth bag with her free hand
with something hard inside it
its a changing bag
we put films in it so that the light wont spoil them
how odd that the light can spoil anything
the screen greys out
stephens own dark room we hear the hum of marks projector and the pounding of marks heart and very faintly the sounds of tony bathing himself
every night you switch on that film machine
we hear his tiny intake of breath
what are these films you cant wait to look at
the sound of his footsteps softly approaching
like a chair
like a chair
what is the film youre showing now
very faintly we hear tony singing in his bath
the singing dies away and the sound returns to normal
over marks shoulder we see mrs
stephens holding her stick in front of her
why dont you lie to me
id never know
youd know at once mrs
stephens smiles then turns her head towards the mm screen
take me to your cinema
he takes her arm gently and guides her towards us
both of them stare at the mm screen
she leans forward her face only inches from the screen the light from the projector flickering on to her
reverse angle shot of mrs
slowly she stretches out her hands and touches the screen
what am i seeing mark
her head and shoulders blot out most of the screen but between her outspread fingers we catch a glimpse of a girls terrified eyes
why dont you answer
close shot of mark and mrs
staring at the screen its no good i was afraid it wouldnt be
the lights failed too soon
pause they always do
ill have to try again
he hurries to his cine camera
ive yet to meet an artist who could judge his own work
mark slips a new spool of film into his cine camera
what do you think youve spoiled
now i must find another
he looks at her thoughtfully then presses a light switch
a spotlight falls blindingly on to her eyes
he presses another switch and then another until the whole of her face is shining with light
why are you putting those lights on my face
he walks towards her
she starts to back away
the shadow of marks head appears on the mm screen
we see him raise his camera then pull down the tripod
black out into the grey darkness of mrs
we hear the purring of marks camera more clearly than we have yet heard it
there is the faint rasp of a cog which needs oiling
the sound of footsteps approaching
the purring changes direction
its almost over
the purring is on top of her
there is a sudden thud
stephens is leaning against the wall
she has dropped her heavy stick
it lies on the floor a few feet away from her
mark is kneeling in front of her the tripod firmly on the floor
the cine camera is pointing upwards into her face
he peers excitedly into the viewfinder
please let me finish
its for helen
she edges towards her stick
he hurries forward and picks it up
he looks at the spike on the end of it then carefully gives it to her by the handle
she grasps it tightly
what do you mean
its for helen
she wants to see something ive photographed
he returns excitedly to his camera
my daughter sees enough of my face without photographs
on marks focusing screen we see the fear on her face
her hand trembles as she wipes away the perspiration
dont be frightened
but it is fear that we are looking at
so put that camera away
on the focusing screen we see her moisten her lips nervously
he switches off the camera abruptly and folds up the tripod
he turns away without looking at her and hurries to the door
close shot of mrs
stephens listening to his movements puzzled
in rather a hurry arent you
he glances towards her
from his pov we see the fear in her eyes
he looks away at once staring into the darkened room
from her pov shooting over her shoulder with a large close shot of her ear in the foreground we see mark standing in the doorway and hear very clearly his
quick uneasy breathing
you must be tired
youre anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden
we hear his quick intake of breath
i wont be selfish
you can take some more pictures if you want to
quietly why not mark
run out of film
cant you find some to please helen
he glances towards her then hurries into the next room
you dont trust yourself to take any more do you
the tapping of her stick is overlaid
mark hurries to the door and opens it staring into the dimly lit passage
over his shoulder we see her tapping her way towards him from the dark room
instincts a wonderful thing isnt it mark
a pity it cant be photographed
over her shoulder we follow the stick towards him
if id listened to it years ago i might have kept my sight
she approaches the door i wouldnt have let a man operate i had no faith in
so im listening to it now
she puts her face close to him it says all this filming isnt healthy and that you need help
his face is averted
his eyes are closed
get it mark
get it quickly

she takes his hand the stairs are the difficult part
they go into the passage
he guides her gently down the stairs
over their shoulders we can see the door of helens room

he stares at helens room then looks quickly away
suddenly she raises her hands and runs them gently over his face
taking my picture
we can see his eyes through her outstretched fingers

mark turns round and walks towards the small group of people assembled round the studio camera close shot of a book entitled the art of fly fishing
through the windscreen we see the entrance to the studio
the driver glances round at his passenger whose face is completely obscured by the book
all we can see is a shock of white hair protruding above were there doctor
to sergeant on gate dr rosen
what a pity
he continues reading
the car enters the studio
the studio camera is ready for a tracking shot
the set is redressed as the hat department of the store
the inspector stands on the dolly looking round with interest
the doctor is sitting in a chair watching everything like an excited schoolboy
the sergeant has positioned himself near the sound crew
baden walks on to the set his arm round dianes shoulder
he is talking to her softly
she keeps her eyes on the floor he leads her to the front of the studio camera

he pats her arm reassuringly
the chief cameraman nods to mark
from the inspectors pov we see mark pull a tape measure from the front of the camera and hold it to dianes forehead
from marks pov we see the inspector watching him over the top of the studio camera
a man with a shock of white hair is also watching him
and the sergeant stares at him from the other side of the set
the tape measure in marks hand remains steady
from the inspectors pov we see mark replace the tape measure and take up his position on a small stool by the side of the camera
shouting quiet everyone

the doctor sneezes violently and all heads turn towards him
in the nervous laughter that follows the assistant cameraman whispers to the chief cameraman
that sneezer geezers a psychiatrist

close shot of mark turning round to look at the doctor a hint of hope in his face
close shot of the inspector following marks glance

diane approaches the hat counter
the assistant smiles at her

she bursts into tears and runs off the set
from the inspectors pov we see baden whisper to the assistant director then hurry after diane
ten minutes break everyone
the unit dissolves into small chattering groups
the assistant director hurries up to the doctor
can you suggest anything doctor
it looked jolly interesting to me
i mean to help her psychologically
give the girl a proper rest
ten minutes is useless
hastily thank you doctor
he bustles off and the doctor is left alone
he glances round thoughtfully
from the doctors pov we see the small chattering groups
then we see mark standing a few yards away watching him
the doctor smiles at him pleasantly
whats your job

i was wondering if you knew my father professor lewis
but of course i knew him
he lectured to me
he looks at mark with renewed interest
so does the inspector
from his pov we see mark and the doctor talking
the doctor is fidgeting with his watch chain
mark fidgets with his jacket button
the inspector then glances towards the hat salesman who is holding court in the comer
we return to mark and the doctor
he was an extraordinary man quite brilliant
you know what he was interested in before he died
mark puts his hands behind his back
i dont remember what he called it
it was something to do with what causes people to be
that would interest him
a most fertile mind
the morbid urge to gaze
coined since his day
have you any manuscripts of his which i could
it could be cured
now about his manuscripts quickly

camera pans to a shelf in the comer
a lunch basket stands next to a cine camera
we hear the assistant director call out were stopping at four today so have a quick lunch everyone
back at two sharp
fade in on the lunch basket
overlaid is the noise of the unit dispersing
mark picks up his camera then reaches for the lunch basket
an urgent voice whispers behind him

the clapper boy glances round carefully
the inspector and sergeant are wandering casually towards the door

camera pans to a comer of the studio
the inspector and sergeant stand in the shadows

he looks round thoughtfully which ones
close shot of sign public library
long shot of very modern glass walled building
helen comes out with a manuscript in a parcel under her arm
mark watches her
beyond him stands an insignificant looking man in a raincoat
helen looks at her watch
mark looks at his
helen hurries homeward
mark slowly turns his back and walks away gradually gathering speed
the man in the raincoat follows him
mark hurries towards the shop
ahead of him a street clock stands at just on six
mark unslings his cine camera and photographs this clock
then he hurries into the shop
the man in the raincoat walks into camera
he looks at the clock puzzled then glances at the newsagents window
he gazes with interest at marks photograph of milly then walks thoughtfully down the street
all the clocks in the kingdom chime the hour of six
peters is behind the counter
dont make a habit of this

he turns to the door

he holds out a key close shot of mark staring at the key
whats the matter

mark takes the key
he starts to smile
the till will be empty if thats what youre smiling about
mark turns to the door
you know what i want now
no fancy stuff
mark goes into the inner room he is still smiling
from the opposite side of the street we see mr
peters locking the door of the shop and hurrying down the road
the man in the raincoat watches him puzzled
close shot of milly very angry in a dressing gown
youve spoiled my whole evening you have
mark closes the door behind him
whats the idea
i shant be here tomorrow
he hurries to the window why
going on manoeuvres with the boy scouts
he starts to draw the curtains and stops suddenly
over his shoulder we see the man in the raincoat standing on the opposite side of the street
i thought so
mark raises his cine camera and carefully photographs the detective through a chink in the curtains
have you gone absolutely
completing a documentary
youre a document and a half you are
is it safe to be alone with you
he draws the curtains and turns round
might be more fun if it wasnt
he turns round and walks slowly and a little sadly towards her black out the screen remains dark for a moment
from the detectives pov we see the chink of light between the curtains of a window above the newsagents shop go out
camera tracks towards the door of the shop
mark comes out his cine camera over his shoulder
he has a key in his hand
he closes the door of the shop
then looks at the key
he fits it into the lock then slips it through the letter box
he turns and hails a taxi
close shot of the detective
he looks at the shop hesitates decides to follow mark hails another cab
mark gets into his taxi
as the driver pulls down the flag
stephens head falling on to her chest
she is lying in bed completely drunk snoring lustily
a hand smooths her forehead
helen is leaning over the bed
she has her coat on
she shakes her mothers shoulders
stephens snores on
she shakes her again but it is hopeless
helen pulls the bedclothes round her mother then turns away
she picks up a large envelope and her handbag and hurries to the door
helen walks towards the stairs
the door of tonys room opens and he pokes his head round
where are you going
to leave something for mark
you havent much time for me these days
its all right ill be here if you want me
he turns to his room by the way
your mother was yelling out something before you came in
about mark photographing her
you must be mistaken
see you sometime
he goes into his room closing the door
she stares after him for a moment then hurries up the stairs
helen knocks on the door
she knocks again then opens the door and goes inside
helen enters and glances towards the door of the dark room
she looks thoughtfully at the envelope in her hand then goes in to the dark room
helen fumbles for a switch
she finds one and presses it
a spotlight falls on marks projector throwing its shadow on to the dazzling white screen
helen smiles and walks towards the projector
taxi arrives and mark gets out
dont know what to make of it sir
he went to a library a solicitors office and a newsagents shop private photography there if you ask me
shall i hang around outside the house sir
dont think so either
all right sir ill give you the details when i get back
he replaces the receiver close shot of helen
she is standing by the projector holding her envelope thoughtfully
she smiles suddenly and opens her envelope
she takes out a bound manuscript
we see a label on the manuscript the magic camera by helen stephens
she takes a pencil from her pocket and opens the manuscript
then she sits at marks table and writes a note on the flyleaf
the projector is at her elbow
a telephone by a mans elbow
the chief inspector snatches up the telephone
chief inspector gregg
put him on the line
peters looking very sick on the telephone
went up to look around found her
close shot of the chief inspector
whats the address
did you say news
he slams down the receiver and jumps to his feet
an empty taxi cruising down the street
it passes the detective in the raincoat walking away from marks house
close shot of a note on a flyleaf which reads from one magic camera which needs the help of another
helen closes the manuscript and lays it carefully by the side of the projector
she turns to leave then looks curiously at the projector
close shot of helen hesitating
like a small girl in front of her mothers make up box she touches the projector tentatively hesitates again then presses a switch
a beam of light shoots out
we watch helens face as she looks at the screen
nothing seems wrong for a few seconds then something starts to happen to the comers of her mouth
and then her eyes become locked
and cannot stop watching
some kind of sound comes from the back of her throat
her hands dig into the table and she tries to stand up
she cannot manage it the first time and keeps on watching then like a child waking from a nightmare she jerks herself away from the table and stumbles towards the
close shot of mark standing there watching her
close shot of helen staring at him
again we hear that sound from the back of her throat
he looks away from her at once
dont let me see you
he pushes the door wide open
he looks at her then looks quickly away hurry helen
she turns away from him and forces the words out till i know
she stands with her back to him
from reverse angle we see her struggling for breath
over her shoulder we see him staring at the mm screen
over her shoulder we see him hurry towards the projector
the sound of him switching it off
just a film
she wheels round towards him
from reverse angle we see her looking at him
just a film
close shot of mark
he walks towards the door i killed them
he locks the door with a hint of sadness and now that you know
i want you with me
close shot of helen not enough breath to scream
hardly enough to breathe
youll be safe as long as i cant see you frightened so stand in the shadows helen
she stands motionless
from her pov we see him standing in front of the door looking ahead of him
she backs slowly away into the shadows at the back of the room
must tell someone everything
has to be you
close shot of helen standing in the shadows where her mother stood
this was his laboratory
and you know some of what he did
but not all
the room is suddenly filled with the terrified screaming of a small boy
helen wheels round
the screaming seems to be coming from the walls
marks hand is on a switch one of a number on a panel
he presses another switch
there is a click and the screaming stops to be replaced by a low sobbing
he presses another switch
there is a moments silence
all the rooms were wired for sound
we suddenly hear the ticking of a clock
close shot of helen listening
the click of a switch and we hear a loud snoring
the click of a switch and we hear tonys voice
no one will come in
i dont care
stop it tony
mark listens with interest
quietly turn it off
he does so at once
she walks towards him
he turns away from her
look at me mark
not if youre frightened
look at me
slowly he faces her
what did you do
to those girls
what did you do mark
he tries to turn away but she follows him
if you want to torment me
for the rest of my life
then make me imagine
close shot of mark his eyes closed
what did you do
to those girls
show me mark
but if youre frightened
show me or ill remain frightened
for the rest of my life
he turns to his cine camera and picks it up
he releases the tripod
camera holds on helen
she stands very still against the wall
marks voice is overlaid
do you know
what the most frightening thing in the world is
she is looking at something puzzled
the sound of his footsteps approaching
so i did something
we see a look of fear spring into her eyes
we see the spike approaching her throat
but she is looking at something else
when they felt the spike
touching their throats
and knew i was going to kill them
the spike is touching her throat
i made them watch their own deaths
close shot of helens face several times its natural size
she is looking at herself in a large circular magnifying mirror which has been fitted over the cameras face
the mirror entirely obscures both mark and the camera
there is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of the camera winks
as helen looks at her terrified distorted face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle of her forehead
made them see their own terror as the spike went in
and if death has a face they saw that too
close shot of mark crouching behind the mirror sweat pouring down his forehead
his finger on the trigger of the camera
ill never photograph you
i promised i promised not you
helens eyes are closed
the spike is still touching her throat
close shot of mark his face turned away from the viewfinder
theres the sound of a car pulling up
he hurries to the other room
the police arrive three cars
mark appears at an upstairs window with his camera
he thinks mark has a gun
they all duck
mark raises his camera and photographs them
the police recover and charge for the house
mark hurries back into the room carrying his camera
he knows exactly what he has to do
give yourself up
ive been ready for this
for such a long time
rapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall
then he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude towards him
what are you
itll be all right
he makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the camera then switches on all the floodlights
we can hear the policemen pounding on the door
i can beat that
he crosses to a switch presses it
the room is filled with a small boys screaming
give yourself up
he stands next to her and looks at his long array of cameras
we see that each one of them has been fitted with a small metal disc a delayed release and that some of the older cameras have flashlights attached
watch them helen
watch them say goodbye one by one he presses a master switch on the wait ive timed this
slowly he walks past his cameras
as he does the metallic disc on each one explodes with a little plop and the eye of each camera winks once as if in salute
some go off with flashlights on either side of the room
the sound of footsteps hurrying up the stairs
ahead of mark coming steadily closer are the spikes of the tripod
the mirror on the cine camera reflects the approach and helens terrified face
the childs screaming reaches its peak as mark approaches the spikes
ahead of him on the small table where his projector stands is helens book the magic camera
i could have found your faces for you
the policemen are now rattling on the dark room door
helen im afraid
we see his face terrified in the magnifying mirror
the spikes are against his throat
the eye of the camera is winking rapidly
im glad im afraid
heavy shoulders are pressing against the dark room door
as it breaks in mark lunges forward against the spikes
the cine camera is wrenched away from the wall as he falls back
he crashes against the small table which falls over
he is not parted from his camera it is fixed to him by the tripod and falls back with him covering his face like a canopy
we see his face in the lens of the cine camera
and we see his hand lying limp on the cover of the magic camera
the policemen hurry into the room
they stare motionless at what they see
close shot of helen her face buried in her hands
the childs screaming stops suddenly
and in the absolute silence which follows we hear the voice of marks father dont be a silly boy
theres nothing to be afraid of
and a small voice answers
good night daddy
the spotlights begin to dim
the dazzling white of the mm screen fades slowly into greyness
the room is filled with the gentle breathing of a small child
