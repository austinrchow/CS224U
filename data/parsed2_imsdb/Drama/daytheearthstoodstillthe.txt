north revised final draft february backgrounded by palm trees and rolling surf an american army radar operator sits at his huge instrument intently tracking a target
without interrupting this he speaks with tense excitement into a telephone transmitter strapped to his chest
it is a
in this and the subsequent scenes music and cutting build to an exciting crescendo
a group of british soldiers in shorts and tropical gear are gathered tensely around a piece of radar equipment which is tracking a target
the radar operator says something to another soldier who turns and speaks excitedly into a field telephone
it is a
the microphone bears the word calcutta
an indian announcer his expression one of excitement and terror jabbers into the mike in a native tongue
a clock on the wall indicates that it is the plane is identified by a red star on the fuselage
the radioman is tracking an object on his radar scope
he points it out excitedly to the pilot
the pilot adjusts his microphone and starts making a report back to his base in russian
a group of french farmers is collected around a radio listening wide eyed to the keyed up voice which is telling them in french of a strange object that has
been seen in the sky
they exchange uneasy glances
one old man crosses himself
a breathless american radio reporter is speaking into his mike but we cant hear what hes saying
on the wall behind him is a clock which reads
a clock shows the time to be
the british announcer tries to maintain his traditional bbc calm but finds it almost impossible to control his excitement
reports are coming in from all over the empire from all over the world
the government have not yet issued a statement but there seems to be no question that there actually is a large unidentified object circling the earth at incredible speed
this announcer keeps talking but his voice fades out and now we hear the words the american announcer is saying
staccato with excitement we still dont know what it is or where its from but we do know theres something there
its been tracked around the world by radar traveling at a rate of four thousand miles an hour
the driver and his fare are listening intently to the radio as we hear the voice of another radio reporter
voice off scene this is not another flying saucer scare
scientists and military men have already agreed on that
whatever this is its something real
the attendant who is filling a car with gas leans around to hear the cars radio oblivious to the fact that the cars tank is overflowing
voice off scene we interrupt this program to give you a bulletin just received from one of our naval units at sea
a large object traveling at supersonic speed is headed over the north atlantic toward the east coast of the united states
music builds to a climax and ends
with deliberately controlled calm here in the nations capital there is anxiety and concern but no outward sign of panic
as a matter of fact there are signs of normalcy that seem strangely out of place the beautiful spring weather the tourist crowds at the various monuments and public buildings
a small crowd of tourists is climbing the steps to the columned entrance
under this shot a barely audible distant hum is heard
it grows in volume so imperceptibly in this and the next two shots that we are unconscious of it
crowds are strolling on the mall and across the well kept lawns in front of the smithsonian institution with the leisurely meandering quality that distinguishes sight seers
including several small groups of people moving toward the smithsonian
their attention is attracted as the hum off scene becomes a roar
the sound is unearthly in its intensity and almost unbearable in its swiftly increasing volume
the people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror
several people on the steps of the smithsonian have turned to look
there is cold frozen fear in their eyes
the awful sound keeps increasing in volume
a man following the progress of a huge object in the sky with his eyes
he is held terror stricken
a giant shape still at some distance is approaching the earth at incredible speed
a group of people run wildly across a large expanse of lawn
a huge shadow cast from above onto the grass seems to be pursing them
the great shape is considerably nearer now
of a woman thoroughly shaken held immobile by what she sees and hears
people scatter madly in all directions as the huge spaceship comes in for a landing on a smooth grassy area
the tremendous roar of its motors is suddenly cut off and the great ship settles gently to a perfect landing
the gleaming surface of the ship shows no break of any kind no windows no ports not even the outline of a hatch
it is a fearsome terrifying object giving no evidence of its source or its intention
shooting down on a section of lawn showing the varying reactions of people to the landing
some are still running madly away others singly and in little groups stand as though rooted staring at the ship from a respectful distance
as he stares at the ship with fascination and horror
hed like to run but he cant
his mouth twitches and he emits a nervous little laugh
a woman is holding a two year old child by the hand as she watches the ship awe struck
several people run past them
suddenly the woman grabs up the child with a little sob turns and runs away
a middle aged man runs up to a group of several people pointing wildly toward the ship and yelling irrationally theyre here
he runs off toward another group as we a series of short dissolves showing
a man dashing up to a crowded washington street corner shouting wildly and gesticulating in the direction from which he came
policemen piling into squad cars which roar out of their garage
soldiers rushing out of a barracks at fort myer with rifles and side arms to form up on their company street
newspaper presses rolling at high speed
newscasters chattering excitedly into their microphones
a large telephone switchboard with the girls in a frenzy of activity as they try to handle the calls pouring in
the players are standing on the field in the crowded stadium but the game has been interrupted and everyone is listening to the voice on the loudspeaker system
actual stock shot would be coverage of some dedication or ceremonial
a brigadier general speaks in clipped tones into the telephone
there are a couple of other officers in the room
into phone get me the chief of staff
a shot if one is available of either house listening raptly as an announcement of great import is read by the chair
a distinguished looking government official speaks into the phone with a sense of subdued urgency
i want to speak to the president
listens for a moment im sorry youll have to interrupt him
a nationally known news commentator for purposes of this script lets say drew pearson is seated before a radio mike
he is also being photographed by tv cameras
in a wall near him is a tv screen which shows what is going out on the air
during the ensuing speech a man comes in a hands him a sheaf of news bulletins
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen this is drew pearson
we bring you this special radio television broadcast to give you the latest information on the landing of the space ship in washington
government and defense department officials are concerned by reports of panic in several large eastern cities
i am authorized to assure you that so far there is no reasonable cause for alarm
the rumors of invading armies and mass destruction are based on hysteria and are absolutely false
i repeat these rumors are absolutely false
the ship designed for travel outside the earths atmosphere landed in washington today at p
eastern standard time
we still dont know where it came from but i can reveal that military leaders are considering two possibilities that it came from some unfriendly power here on earth or
that it actually arrived from another planet
camera pans to and dollies in on the tv screen in the wall
on the screen is a shot of the space ship
over scene the ship is resting exactly where it landed two hours ago and there has been no sign of life from inside it
our cameral holds on the tv screen
the cuts that follow are inside the frame of the screen two platoons of infantry soldiers surround the ship their rifles at the ready
over scene troops have been rushed from fort myer and they have formed a cordon around the ship
showing two machine guns two sherman tanks and two mm guns
the gun crews are posted for action and all weapons are trained on the space ship
over scene they are supported by machine guns tanks and artillery
cops are holding back a section of a large crowd some distance away from the ship
the people are wide eyed and tense with excitement
over scene behind police lines there is a large crowd of curiosity seekers
civilians in the crowd their eyes and nerves taut with suspense
a young soldier who grips his rifle and moistens his lips nervously his eyes never leaving the ship
a tank commander blinks from the tension of staring at an unmoving object
the last cut is of the ship itself
over scene as you can see for yourself the army has taken every precaution to meet whatever the situation may require
every eye every weapon is trained on the ship
its been this way for two hours and the tension as he interrupts himself excitedly his attention riveted on the tv screen
just a minute ladies and gentlemen
i think i see something moving
we are at the actual location now not looking at tv
we see the ship surrounded by soldiers two medium tanks two artillery pieces and a couple of machine guns
some distance away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians held back by police
prominent in the scene are newsreel and television cameras
our camera moves in to med
as it does so we see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of the ship
one which is an oddly designed coil of wire slides up and revolves slowly
the other is a section of vented pipe with a convex cap on it
on the soldiers their eyes glued to this first sign of activity from the ship
they shift uneasily gripping their rifles more firmly
after a long tense moment a ramp appears silently out of the side of the ship and slides down to the ground
there is an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp
he looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity
this is klaatu
he is completely human in appearance
the only unearthly thing about him is his clothing
he wears a tunic that is very good looking but at the same time thoroughly comfortable and practical
on his head is a metal helmet that obscures most of his face
it would be impossible to identify him later
the design of this helmet gives the impression that it is more a formal headdress than for protection
klaatu is above all an impressive man a man of tremendous dignity and presence
he has the tolerant superiority that comes with absolute knowledge
of soldiers people in the crowd and policemen
the newsreel and tv men are busy at their cameras
after an impressive moment he raises his arms in the universal gesture of neutrality
then he speaks in perfect english his voice amplified as though through an enunciator
we have come to visit you in peace and with good will
klaatu walks slowly down the ramp toward the soldiers
as he does so he draws from inside his tunic a strange looking object longish and tubular
it might be a a telescope or it might be some strange kind of weapon
shooting from the side showing klaatu advancing slowly toward the line of soldiers
he holds out the mysterious object in front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering but could be misinterpreted as menacing
there is a growing uneasy rumble of muttering among the soldiers as klaatu advances
they are clearly frightened of what he may do
a young second lieutenant standing in front of his platoon
as klaatu advances the lieutenant unslings his carbine
klaatu starts toward the platoon leader raising the object he holds toward the man trying to make clear his intentions
misinterpreting this as a menacing gesture the platoon leader raises his carbine to his shoulder
of one of the tank commanders in the turret of his tank
he is watching klaatu advancing toward the platoon leader and he has drawn his pistol
convinced that the lieutenant is in jeopardy the tank commander aims at klaatu and fires
as klaatu falls to the ground wounded
the object he was holding has dropped from his hand and smashed
the soldiers start to gather around klaatu excitedly when suddenly there appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot
there is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw back at sight of him
the robot is ten feet tall is made in the almost perfect image of a man
he is to be played by an actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal
his eyes flash as though lighted internally
his perfectly fashioned muscular body is covered only with a loincloth
this is gort
there are cries of amazement as gort walks slowly ponderously down the ramp to the ground
as he does so the ramp closes behind him
gorts face is and always remains utterly expressionless
he stops to look at klaatu lying on the ground
then he looks around at the soldiers the tanks and guns
all the guns have been traversing to follow him
from inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound as though power were being generated within him
his eyes flash toward the tank from which klaatu was shot
there is a great metallic clatter and the sherman tank is suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal its parts completely disintegrated
only a piece of tank track and twisted gun barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what had been there
the tanks crew has remained unharmed
the crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in a semicircle taking in all the troops
shooting from behind gort with the back of his head in f
camera pans to follow gorts sweeping gaze
in a growing crash and clatter of metal every weapon in sight is destroyed
the two machine guns are little heaps of junk
the s are larger heaps
the second tank like the first is a three foot pile of scrap
rifles have dropped from the soldiers hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of wood and metal
none of the men has been harmed but their faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced
as they react to the full shock of what has happened
most of them stand rooted to the ground
several laugh hysterically
a few break and run wildly
sudden pandemonium breaks out
utterly terrified by what they have witnessed the crowd becomes a wild milling screaming mob concerned only with escape
he is walking slowly deliberately menacingly toward the tank commander who fired on klaatu
standing by the debris of his tank the man is immobilized with terror
the robot starts to reach out to grab him
lying on the ground
he speaks to gort sharply in a strange language
he pauses obediently in the act of reaching out for the tank commander
dropping his arms he stands motionless and remains that way
he has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain
the two platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly badly shaken by the awesome demonstration of power they have seen
they are uncertain as to what they should do
the platoon leader eyes the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns questioningly to klaatu
with great dignity klaatu picks up the broken object which we see well for the first time
it is a delicately made tubular telescope badly smashed
on it are indications of small electronic gadgets
it was a gift
for your president
glances at the broken object ruefully with this he could have studied life on other planets
klaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation
the two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment
then klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully holding his wounded shoulder
as he does so a colonel and a captain come into scene
to the lieutenants is he all right
got hit in the shoulder sir
the three junior officers exchange ineffectual glances and look to the colonel who thinks for a moment before making his decision
send for an ambulance
get him to walter reed hospital right away
there is a door to the corridor and a door to klaatus room
in the small sitting room talking in tones of hushed concern is a group of men
theres a major general a likable man with a chest full of ribbons
there are also a colonel in command of the hospital a high ranking police officer a couple of medical officers and two civilians
the conversation is interrupted by the entrance from klaatus room of a medical corps major followed by an army nurse
to major how is he
hes all right general
blood pressures a little high but it could be aggravation
wryly cant blame him
i always get mad when somebody shoots me
he still wants to see the president
to general we informed the white house over an hour ago
to major didnt drop any hints about where hes from did he
no sir he didnt
the door to the corridor opens and a worried young captain enters
to the colonel what about the reporters colonel
theyre swarming all over the lobby
the colonel turns in deference to the general
quietly tell them there wont be any statement tonight
glancing down the corridor mr
harleys here from the white house
harley appears in the doorway a brief case under his arm
hes a dignified intelligent member of the white house secretariat
he proceeds uninterruptedly into the room nodding cordially to the general
general indicating klaatus room right in there mr
harley proceeds in businesslike fashion to the door
he knocks and then enters
as harley enters closing the door behind him
klaatu no longer wears his helmet and we see his face clearly for the first time
even sitting up in bed with his shoulder strapped in bandages he is a figure of great authority
his face reflects inner dignity and assurance
harley who is a hardened diplomatist cant help being impressed by his present assignment and a little awed by klaatu
harley obviously has been sent by the president to find out what he can
klaatus eyes study him cool penetrating reserved
my name is harley secretary to the president klaatu continues to study him silently ive been told that you speak our language that your name is mr
coolly just klaatu
the president asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened
we all feel evenly sit down mr
somewhat relieved harley seats himself
he speaks with a half smile hoping to ease the tension
im sure i dont have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise
getting a little smile from klaatu he is encouraged to do some fishing had you been traveling long
about five months your months
you must have come a long way
about million of your miles
harley glances at him quickly to be sure hes not joking
naturally were very curious to know where it is you come from
easily hes a diplomat too from another planet
lets just say that were neighbors
harley reacts as his wildest assumptions are so blandly corroborated
its rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor
im afraid in the present situation youll have to learn to think that way
eyebrows raised the present situation
i mean the reasons for my coming here
his eagerness apparent were very curious about that too
would you care to talk about it
id be glad to
noticing that harley is settling himself expectantly not now of course with you alone
perhaps youd rather discuss it personally with the president somewhat sharply this is not a personal matter mr
it concerns all the people on your planet
startled by the scope of this statement i im not sure i understand i want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the earth
shocked and perturbed by this notion im afraid that would be a little awkward
its its completely without precedent
and there are practical considerations the time involved the enormous distances
coolly i traveled million miles
what about your united nations
surprised and a little puzzled you know about the united nations
weve been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years
thats how we learned your languages
lately weve been getting your television also
wryly you must have a rather strange impression of us
smiling the first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle
then his mind reverts to the seriousness of the situation and he speaks gravely
im sure you recognize from our broad casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world
surely you would agree evenly i am not concerned mr
harley with the internal affairs of your planet
i consider that to be your business not mine
i was only hoping to make you understand
sternly impressively my mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles
it concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on earth
uncomfortably perhaps if you could explain a little i intend to explain
to all the nations simultaneously
his manner precludes opposition how do we proceed mr
harley is thoroughly shaken
the tremendous force and power implicit in klaatuss manner preclude the possibility of argument
after a long thoughtful moment we could call a special meeting of the general assembly
but of course the un doesnt represent all of the nations
then why not a meeting of all the chiefs of state
helplessly but patiently believe me you dont understand
they wouldnt sit down at the same table
growing a little impatient with such nonsense klaatu eyes him evenly speaks with jovian authority
i dont want to resort to threats mr
i simply tell you bluntly that the future of your planet is at stake
i suggest you transmit that message to the nations of the earth
the eyes of the two men meet for a long silent moment
then harley rises quietly
i will make that recommendation to the president
he picks up his brief case and hat i must tell you in all honesty that im extremely dubious about the results
with a half smile apparently im not as cynical about earths people as you are
ive been dealing in earths politics a good deal longer than you have
he bows goodnight sir
he turns and goes out
he stares after harley for a moment puzzled by this strange and apparently unreasoning world he has come to
he shakes his head in thoughtful tolerant bewilderment
searchlights have lighted up up the eerie shapes of the space ship and gort
a circle of soldiers guard the area while a crew of men can be seen working around the ship
a master sergeant of engineers dressed in fatigues is inspecting the side of the ship carefully
he has an acetylene torch in his had and a welding helmet over his face
the major general previously seen in the hospital sitting room enters and speaks to the sergeant
getting any place sergeant
raising his helmet no sir
shaking his head in annoyance beats me general
i saw that ramp come out of the side of the ship right here
now i cant even find a crack
a man named carlson a civilian metallurgical expert comes into scene
the general nods to him
whats the report carlson
discouraged weve tried everything from a blowtorch to a diamond drill
nodding toward gort what about him
hes made out of the same stuff
has he moved
not an inch this is the toughest material i ever saw general
for hardness and strength its out of this world
with a wry half smile i can tell you officially thats where it came from
the two men exchange an uneasy glance then turn to look at the ship
two medical corps officers a captain and a major are interestedly studying a series of x ray films
the skeletal structure is completely normal
pointing same for the major organs heart liver spleen kidneys
and the lungs are the same as ours
must mean a similar atmosphere similar pressure
nodding toward klaatus room how old do you think he is
oh id say forty five
smiling he told me this morning when i examined him
hes seventy eight
i dont believe it
their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty
how does he explain that
he says their medicine is that much more advanced
the major stares at him blankly he was very nice about it
but he made me feel like a third class witch doctor
the door to klaatus rooms opens and major white appears
hes the man who attended klaatu the day before
he closes the door behind him and stands motionless facing the other two his face wearing a blank expression
i took a bullet out of that mans arm yesterday
what about it
utterly bewildered i just examined the wound and its all healed
what does he say about it
said he put some salve on it some stuff he had with him
shows them a small odd looking tube in his hand what are you going to do with it
take it downstairs and have it analyzed
on his way to the door shaking his head then i dont know whether ill just get drunk or give up the practice of medicine
as he starts out the door to the corridor he passes mr
harley who is on his way in carrying his ever present brief case
harley is accompanied by an enlisted m
harley goes to the door of klaatus room a businesslike expression on his face
he knocks on the door then enters
remains in the sitting room
as harley enters
klaatu is up out of bed walking around in a medical corps robe and pajamas
he appears to be completely recovered
surprised not to find him in bed im glad to see you up and around
have you any news
not very good news im afraid
digs into his briefcase for some papers the president accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night
grimly let me read you some of the replies
he selects a cable and reads the premier wishes to inform the government of the united states that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by
the president unless the meeting is held in moscow
with a grimly pointed glance at klaatu harley reads another cable the suggestion of the president regarding the possibility of a meeting in moscow would be unacceptable to her majestys
government at the present time
representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in washington
he looks up at klaatu and shrugs well there you have it
harley extends a sheaf of cables for klaatus inspection but he ignores them
klaatu has listened to this recital first incredulously then with mounting indignation
conscious of his quiet olympian wrath harley continues uncomfortably
i tried to make you understand
the suspicions the jealousies the mistrust uneasily under klaatus level gaze surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power its not your government im thinking about
its your world
now that you understand the situation more clearly perhaps youd like to discuss the matter with the president sternly i will not speak to any one nation or group of
sharply bitterly i dont intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions
our problems are very complex mr
you mustnt judge us too harshly
i can judge only by what i see
your impatience is quite understandable
sharply i am impatient with stupidity
my people have learned to live without it
ruefully im afraid my people havent
with real sincerity im very sorry i wish it were otherwise
reluctantly harley has picked up his hat and brief case
he finds klaatu staring out the window
as he looks out the window thoughtfully
what he sees has given him an idea
shooting down from klaatus viewpoint at people strolling about the hospital grounds
most of them are civilian visitors but there is a sprinkling of nurses and ambulatory patients
as klaatu turns back to harley he speaks thoughtfully incisively
before making any decisions i think i should get out among your people become familiar with the basis for these strange unreasoning attitudes
under the circumstances im afraid that will be impossible
harley has paused near the door a little embarrassed by klaatus level gaze
i must ask that you dont attempt to leave the hospital
our military people have insisted on this
im sure youll understand
with a polite nod he goes out
klaatu stares after him as he realizes that he is in effect a prisoner
he shakes his head slowly thoughtfully
the ways of this planet are strange indeed
harley has paused to watch as the m
takes out a key and inserts it in the lock of klaatus door
as he hears the click of the lock he turns toward the door
realizing theyve locked him in he smiles with tolerant amusement
in the dim light of one lamp the door to the corridor opens and a nurse enters carrying a tray of medication
she is accompanied by the same m
as previously seen
the nurse pauses as the m
takes out a key and inserts it in the lock of klaatus door
to his surprise he finds that the door is not locked
he exchanges a glance with the nurse then pulls the door open and hurries inside
as the m
crosses the unlighted room toward the bed
the only light cones from the open door to the sitting room
s eyes go wide as he looks at the bed
it is unmade and unoccupied
terrified the m
turns to the nurse who is standing in the doorway
dashes out of the room through the doorway past the nurse
she turns to follow him as we a series of short dissolves showing
excitedly reporting klaatus disappearance to the officer of the day
the hospital guard detail hurrying out of the guardhouse to form up in front of the sergeant of the guard
a high level military conference gathered at a table discussing the matter with great concern
a street corner newsstand with people eagerly grabbing papers
the headline reads man from mars escapes from
radio announcers chattering excitedly into their microphones
a series of close ups of people listening to the radio
their faces reveal their awestruck terror
a terrified mother drags her two children in from the street through the front door slams the door and bolts it
camera is on the back of a man dressed in a business suit who is walking along the sidewalk of a dimly lighted almost deserted middle class street
he carries a suitcase and he glances idly at the drab looking stone facades of the old two story houses
as he passes from the open windows of the houses come the voices of radio announcers
we get a sentence or two from one house and then as the man and our camera pass on this voice fades and another is picked up
we get the impression that everyone is glued to his radio
over scene authorities at walter reed hospital refused to comment on how he managed to escape or what measures might be taken to apprehend him
these fantastic descriptions of the creature are denounced as rumor by police chief walter baxter
he is not eight feet tall as reported nor does he have tentacles in place of arms theres no denying that there is a monster at large that we are
dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and power
the public is urged to take ordinary precautions and to remain calm as we await further developments three separate reports of people who claim to have seen the space man
in the past hour
one from des moines iowa one from a village in northern florida and one from chicago
camera overtakes the man as he pauses under the light of a street lamp and reveals that it is klaatu
he has stopped to look at something out of scene
from klaatus viewpoint of a sign on one of the houses reading room for rent he seems to hesitate debating a plan he has in mind
he raises his right arm to scratch his head thoughtfully and notices for the first time a small tag or ticket attached to the inside of the right forearm of
the coat he is wearing
puzzled he pulls off the ticket and looks at it
it is the sort of tag a cleaning establishment attaches to clothing
printed on it is the legend capitol dry cleaning service
scrawled in a penciled hand is the notation dr
a walter reed hospital
he smiles wryly at this reminder of where he got the suit and he destroys the ticket
he glances down at the suitcase beside him
it bears the initials l
klaatus hand comes into scene and lifts up the suitcase
camera holds as klaatu carries the bag toward the house and mounts the stone steps to the entrance
there s no light in the room except what splashes in from the hall
gathered around a television set are five adults and a little boy their faces eerie in the reflected light from the screen
the room is done in average boardinghouse style antimacassars and all
the attention of the people is riveted on the television screen where a newscaster is reading a bulletin
while the president made no effort to minimize the crisis he urged people all over the country to remain calm
he said the entire facilities of fbi and other federal agencies are being bought to bear
he pointed out however that this is no ordinary man hunt
he warned we may be up against powers that are beyond our control
the landlady a stern faced woman of middle age named mrs
crockett rises nervously and crosses to the television set
tensely i cant stand any more of this
its enough to drive a person crazy
she snaps off the set sharply
bobby benson a bright eyed eleven year old is seated beside his mother helen benson an attractive girl of thirty
disappointed that the set has been turned off bobbys roving eye has fallen on something in the doorway to the hall
wide eyed he nudges his mother and points
hey mom whos that
including the doorway to the hall
silhouetted motionless against the light from the hall is the figure of a man
all eyes follow hobbys pointed finger and there is a stifled gasp as they are startled out of their preoccupation
one of the men turns on the lights and klaatu is revealed standing calmly in the doorway
there is a shocked silence for a moment then mrs
apologizing nervously for the tension in the room i im sorry
what is it you want
my name is carpenter
im looking for a room
there is a noticeable letdown in the general tension during which booby has been studying klaatu his imagination working overtime
are you an fbi man
no im afraid not
helen has stepped forward to make bobby desist
bet he is mom
bet hes out looking for that space man
with an apologetic smile at klaatu i think weve all been hearing too much about space men
crockett reverts to her role as landlady
she likes to think of her house as a home
starting the introductions with helen this is mrs
with a smile that would split a brick and little bobby
indicating a middle aged couple and a younger but more wizened man mr
barley and mr
there are polite noddings and how do you dos
crockett is satisfied that shes established a cozy atmosphere
pleased to the point of challenge well this is our little family
then getting down to business i have a very nice room on the second floor
she leads the way toward the hall and klaatu starts to follow picking up his suitcase when he is intercepted by bobby
can i help you look for the space man
excitedly i know what he looks like
hes got a square head and three great big eyes
good naturedly calming him down thats enough bobby
i think its time you went to bed
to bobby with a prop smile we mustnt annoy mr
carpenter or he wont want to stay here
she goes on into the hall followed by klaatu who has exchanged a polite smile with helen
crockett leads the way up the stairs
hes really a dear little boy and quiet as a mouse
with a shrewd chatty smile youre a long way from home arent you mr
how did you know
pleased with her cleverness oh i can tell a new england accent a mile away
five of the boarders mr
krull helen benson and klaatu are finishing their sunday morning breakfast
barley is a middle class helen hokinson lady form and unrelenting
her husband is a born complainer
krull is a shriveled little accountant precise and finicky
as they finish their coffee all except helen are immersed in the sunday papers
helen seems preoccupied with her own thoughts
from a portable radio on the table comes gabriel heaters voice
and so this sunday morning we ask the question thats been plaguing the entire nation for two days now where is this creature and what is he up to
if he can build a space ship that can fly to earth and a robot that can destroy our tanks and guns what other terrors can he unleash at will
obviously we must find this monster
we must track him down like a wild animal and destroy him
it is a full page layout in the style of the american weekly showing a demented artists conception of a mass invasion of space ships
weird looking creatures are slaughtering earth people with ray guns
the caption at the top of the image reads are we long for this world
gabriel heaters voice continues uninterruptedly over this and the next two scenes
he is reading his paper with considerable interest
the third page story reads savant calls meeting to study space ship
professor jacob barnhardt world famous scientist and nobel prize winner has invited fellow scientists from all over the world to meet with him in washington and study the recently landed
his face is thoughtful as he finishes reading
this story seems to impress and interest him
then suddenly he finds his attention caught at what the radio voice is saying
but where would such a creature hide himself
would he disappear into the north woods
or would he slither off into the sewers of some great city
klaatu has a reaction of affronted dignity at this monstrously distasteful idea
there is grave danger everyone agrees to that
the question is what can we do to protect ourselves
what measures can we take that will during the above mrs
barley has turned to her husband in sharp annoyance
george i wish youd turn that radio off
im trying to concentrate
barley reaches out and snaps off the radio
snorting he tosses his paper down why doesnt the government do something thats what i want to know
mildly what can they do
theyre only people just like us
people my foot
its enough to give you the shakes
hes got that robot standing there ten foot tall just waiting for orders to destroy us
thoughtfully this space man or whatever he is
we automatically assume hes a menace
maybe he isnt at all
glaring at her for this silly notion then whats he hiding for
why doesnt he come out in the open
indicating the radio like the fella says whats he up to
maybe hes afraid
with a derisive snort hes afraid
after all he was shot the moment he landed here
she pauses for a moment thoughtfully i was just wondering what i would do
to helen helpfully perhaps before deciding on a course of action youd want to know more about the people here to orient yourself in a strange environment
sharply theres nothing strange about washington mr
quietly tongue in cheek a person from another planet might disagree with you
if you want my opinion he came from right here on earth
with significant emphasis and you know where i mean
they wouldnt come in a space ship
theyd come in airplanes
as though with superior knowledge i wouldnt be so sure about that
delivering the final word stands to reason that fella wants some thing or he wouldnt be here
facing klaatu that make sense carpenter
klaatu pauses for a moment then recites pleasantly
i must admit im a little confused
crockett enters and speaks to helen
stevens is here to see you
oh thank you
she rises and goes out
finish your coffee george
i told the carsons wed be there at eleven
as helen crosses the room to greet tom stevens
hes a personable young man with a breezy manner and considerable charm
there is between them an easy air of intimacy
smiling warmly good morning
tom kisses her
were all set
i picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car
and the radios still busted so me can forget about the space man for today
a little disturbed theres only one thing i havent been able to arrange for anyone to stay with bobby
tentatively i dont suppose we could take him with us
understandably unenthusiastically well we could theres always somebody here but today of course theyve all got plans
i havent any plans
helen and tom turn in surprise
including klaatu who has wandered in from the dining room unnoticed by tom and helen
klaatu continues with an air of wanting to be helpful without wanting to interfere
id be glad to spend the day with him if youd let me
impulsively say thatll be great
wouldnt it helen
hesitating a little confused by the offer its awfully nice of you to suggest it
remembering the two men havent met im sorry mr
carpenter this is tom stevens
the two men shake hands and exchange how do you dos
then klaatu turns back to helen
bobby and i had a fine time yesterday afternoon
we talked and listened to the radio
smiling at helen i thought today he might show me around the city
helen is debating the matter in her mind concerned about leaving bobby with a comparative stranger but tempted because of her favorable impression of klaatu
easily suppose i ask bobby how he feels about it
he turns with a little smile and starts out of the room
helen still not quite decided turns to tom with a questioning look
the great seated brooding figure of lincoln is at the far end of the impressive main hall
a few tourists are moving about the place
they are in the south hall on the wall of which is inscribed the gettysburg address
they stand silently side by side reading the inscription
featuring the last part of the address
it reads and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth
visibly impressed those are great words
with an air of discovery he must have been a great man
bobby is impressed by the depth and sincerity of klaatus tribute but a little confused by his air of having discovered lincoln
hobby watches klaatu with a puzzled expression then follows as klaatu moves off slowly
shooting against one of the huge fluted columns as klaatu and bobby come out of the building
deeply preoccupied klaatu speaks with impatient urgency
thats the kind of man id like to talk to
bobby looks up at him in bewilderment
after a moment klaatu speaks slowly thoughtfully
bobby whos the greatest man in america today
puzzling it over gee i dont know
the space man i guess
secretly amused i was speaking of earth men
i meant the greatest philosopher the greatest thinker
you mean the smartest man in the whole world
yes that would do nicely
after a moments thought well professor barnhardt i guess
hes the greatest scientist in the world
he pauses thoughtfully speaks slowly as he recalls the newspaper story he read he lives here in washington doesnt he
right near where my mother works
where is that
department of commerce
shes a secretary
klaatu nods they have a man they call the secretary but he isnt at all
my mothers a real secretary
after a moment eagerly mr
carpenter now can we go see the space ship
a crew of army engineers is in process of erecting a temporary structure such as a large quonset hut or b hanger to enclose the space ship and gort
the walls are partially up and already have concealed part of the ship
the area is roped off and there are army guards to keep the sightseers back
there is a crowd of people behind the ropes watching
camera moves in to reveal the backs of bobby and klaatu
bobby is studying the ship and gort eagerly his imagination thoroughly aroused
klaatu is watching the men at work with mild quiet amusement
from bobbys viewpoint
bobbys eyes are wide with awe as he watches the giant robot
boy ill bet hes strong
i bet he could knock down a whole building
with a quizzical smile i shouldnt be at all surprised
bobbys attention shifts to the ship
from bobbys viewpoint
excitedly indicating the ship gee id like to get inside and see how it works
what do you think makes it go
quietly after a glance around well atomic power i would imagine
looking at klaatu incredulously i thought that was only for bombs
its for a lot of other things too
you think it can go faster than an f
yes i think so
shooting from a side angle to include a couple of men who are listening to klaatus conversation
they are nudging each other amused at the way this man is pretending to explain things to the little boy
about a thousand miles an hour
klaatu has noticed the two men who have edged a little closer to listen
he is not perturbed by them but he lowers his voice a bit
maybe four thousand miles an hour
and outside the earths atmosphere a good deal faster
how could they make a landing
well there are several ways to reduce landing speed
you see the velocity klaatu interrupts himself as he realizes that he may be going too far
the two men have moved closer listening and grinning
one of them whispers to the other behind the back of his hand
then the man realizes that klaatu has stopped speaking and is looking at him
grinning keep goin mister
he was fallin for it
the two men burst out laughing and move off together
bobby who has missed the point of this by play looks at klaatu then after the men
as they move out of scene they laugh loudly at the little boys confusion
klaatu takes bobbys hand to lead him away from the roped off area
camera follows them as they move away through the crowd
as they do so several newsboys are working their way through the crowd with newly arrived extras
the boys are calling out the extras police under fire
army put in charge
space man still at large
people are eagerly buying the papers
klaatu and booby watch this as they pass through the crowd
in newsboys hand
the headline reads space man eludes police in another newsboys hand
this headline reads district as they move on away from the excited crowd of people
klaatus reaction has been one of mild curiosity
bobby looks up at him
you think theyll ever find him
alter a moments pause i dont know bobby
im inclined to doubt it
as they continue walking mr
carpenter what does velocity mean
preoccupied velocity is the time rate of change of position
this explanation misses bobby by several light years
he glances up at klaatu blankly
ill bet thats the way professor barnhardt talks
pulled out of his reverie klaatu glances down at bobby and smiles apologetically
bobby grins back at him
then as they walk on a few more steps klaatu stops and speaks thoughtfully
bobby i have an idea
lets go see professor barnhardt and find out how he talks
with a half smile of accusation youre just kidding arent you
wouldnt you like to meet him
well sure i would but hes to be not going taken in aw ill bet youd be scared
with a private smile we can scare him more than he can scare us
bobby stares up at him and his face breaks into a broad admiring grin
i like you mr
youre a real screwball
the house is an unimposing old fashioned structure shouldered on either side by similar one family dwellings
there is a flight of stone steps leading up to the entrance and a large porch across the front of the house
klaatu and bobby walk into scene and pause klaatu glances at bobby and bobby nods toward the house
they move on up the steps to the entrance
bobby all eagerness and excitement presses the bell
they wait a moment and there is no answer
disappointed at the thought gee maybe he isnt home
bobby wanders down the porch and looks into a window
fascinated by what he sees he gestures to klaatu
betcha this is where he works after a glance at the front door klaatu joins bobby at the window and looks in
shooting through the window over the heads of klaatu and bobby
the room is more of a workroom than a study
it is in comfortably shabby disarray with papers and books everywhere
theres a battered old desk and a day bed
one wall is solid bookshelves and on the other two are blackboards covered with a fantastic array of complex equations graphs and diagrams
his attention has been caught by one of the blackboards and he studies it with great interest and curiosity
it is covered with a particularly complicated series of equations in a chalky scrawl involving angles of vector keplerian ellipses etc
the final equations are unsolved they have no answers after the equals sign
across are little printed signs tacked to the blackboard reading dont erase
and dont touch
bewildered bobby looks from the blackboard up at klaatu
still studying the blackboard klaatu is shaking his head and clucking his tonsure as one might at the attempts of a child to solve a problem in arithmetic
indicating the equations what does that mean
its a problem in celestial mechanics
bet hes the only one in the world knows the answer
he shakes his head smiling he doesnt know the answer
and hell never get it that way
bobby moves over to a pair of french doors beyond the window and tries to peer in through the curtained doors
he absently tries the doors and finds them locked
then he turns away with a disappointed but philosophical shrug
we probably couldnt get to see him even if he was home
as bobby moves away from the doors dejectedly klaatu puts his hand on the knob
hes watching klaatu and his eyes widen at what he sees
in complete surprise hey where you going
he has opened the door and is standing in the doorway his hand still on the knob
he is smiling at bobby with secret amusement
hes got an idea
if hes that difficult to see perhaps we ought to leave a calling card
klaatu disappears into the study
amazed bobby follows
bobby watches as klaatu walks to the blackboard and picks up a piece of chalk
as though correcting a schoolboys work he makes large check marks at several points in each equation
an efficient looking middle aged woman is mounting the steps to the entrance getting her front door key out of her purse when her eye falls on the french doors
which are standing ajar
puzzled she starts down the porch toward the doors
this woman is barnhardts secretary and her name is hilda
bobby is watching as klaatu writes across the blackboard in a bold hand differentiate the equation
klaatu underlines this comment with a sharp stroke when a stern voice is heard off screen
what are you doing in here
as klaatu and bobby turn in surprise
standing in the open french doors is hilda eyeing them with stern suspicion
outraged by klaatus desecration of the sacred blackboard how dare you write on that blackboard
klaatu eyes her mildly do you realize the professor has been working on that problem for weeks
pleasantly hell catch on to it in no time now
controlling herself with an effort how did you get in here
and what do you want
we came to see professor barnhardt
well hes not here
and he wont be back till this evening
sternly i think youd better leave now
unruffled klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad
he tears off the piece of paper and hands it to hilda
you might keep this
with easy assurance i think the professor will want to get in touch with me
with a polite nod he goes out the french doors followed by bobby
hilda eyes the door for a moment then glances down at the paper in her hand disturbed and puzzled by this stranger
her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks up an eraser debating whether to erase klaatus corrections
at that moment the french door opens and klaatu sticks his head in
startled hilda drops the eraser
pointing to the blackboard i wouldnt erase that
the professor needs it very badly
and he disappears leaving hilda to glare after him in impotent rage
deciding that this man is either a crackpot or a menace she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts dialing a number
as klaatu and bobby come down the steps and turn into the sidewalk
they are talking and laughing together but we cant hear their conversation
camera pans with them as they move on up the sidewalk revealing two kids playing hopscotch
klaatu watches fascinated as he walks by
then having passed the kids he tries the one footed then two footed hop that characterizes the game
hilda is talking on the phone
no sergeant there was no classified material around but i have instructions to report anything unusual to the police
yes im professor barnhardts secretary
consulting the paper in her hand the mans name is carpenter and he lives at st
yes thats right bobby and klaatu come out of a wooded path into a section of the cemetery where the myriad crosses seem to reach into infinity
they pause for a moment then bobby leads the way through one of the rows
in one of the many rows are crosses that extend beyond camera range
camera moves in on one of the crosses
it bears the name lt
as they come into scene and look down at the grave
thats my father
klaatu glances at the boy then nods understandingly he was killed at a place called anzio
klaatus glance roves out thoughtfully to the infinite rows of crosses and his eyes are sad as they return to bobby
klaatu and bobby are approaching a bench beside a pathway overhung with trees
bobby leads the way to the bench and they sit down
klaatus eyes stray out to the myriad crosses
reflectively did all these people die in wars
somewhat surprised sure
didnt you ever hear of arlington cemetery
no im afraid not
very serious mr
carpenter you dont seem to know about anything
amused ill tell you bobby ive been away for a long time
very far away
is it different where youve been
indicating the cemetery dont they have places like this
slowly they have cemeteries
but not like this one
you see they dont have any wars
bobby looks at him puzzled and impressed by this incomprehensible notion
gee thats a good idea
his eyes are drawn subconsciously out to the rows of crosses
then he turns back to klaatu with a slow dawning look of curiosity and klaatu deliberately changes the subject
what would you like to do this afternoon
after a moment bobbys expression changes and he breaks into a broad grin
go to the movies
he didnt dare hope for this no foolin
then he hesitates tell me bobby do you have to have money to go there
bobby gives him a look of amazement then grins assuming klaatu was kidding and simply hasnt any money
eagerly ive got some money
my mother gave me two dollars
no i want to take you to the movies
he takes some objects out of his pocket do you think theyd accept these
sparkling in his palm are eight or ten cut diamonds of various sizes
the boy is staring at the stones in wide eyed amazement
gee those look like diamonds
some places thats what people use for money
theyre easy to carry and they dont wear out
staring at them fascinated bet theyre worth about a million dollars
would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them
with a nervous unsure smile well sure but the boy studies klaatus face to see if hes kidding
realizing that hes not bobbys face takes on a childishly shrewd expression as though he were about to trade a jackknife for an ocean liner
the boy takes out two dollar bills and offers them almost challengingly
klaatu takes the bills and hands bobby two good sized diamonds
they study their new acquisitions with interest
bobby looks up from his diamonds to steal a guilty glance at klaatu
lets not say anything to my mother about this mr
mildly curious why not bobby
gravely she doesnt like me to steal from people
shooting toward the curb as a police prowl car drives up and stops in front of the boardinghouse
a detective in plainclothes gets out and gestures to the uniformed driver to pull up the street a way and wait
the driver nods and the car moves off as the detective crosses the sidewalk to the boardinghouse
as the detective mounts the steps he glances through a window into the living room
klaatu can be seen reading to bobby who is perched happily on the arm of klaatus chair
the detective moves to the front door ant rings the bell
there is the sound of running feet and in a moment the door is opened and bobby appears
carpenter come home yet
studying the man curiously yeah hes right inside
tell him id like to see him
calling out mr
to the detective come on in
the detective steps inside and bobby closes the door as klaatu appears from the living room
your name carpenter
puzzled that anyone should know him yes
then recalling with a smile of satisfaction oh i suppose professor barnhardts looking far me
dryly with grim emphasis i been looking for you all afternoon
an inexpensive convertible a ford or chevrolet drives up and stops in front of the house
helen and tom are in it
you get the feeling that helen and ton have spent a very enjoyable day together and are reluctant to say goodnight
tom puts his arm around her and kisses her
fondly it was a wonderful day
you still havent answered my question
warmly sincere you know how i feel tom
i just want to think it over
the boss is leaving for chicago tomorrow
if i could tell him i was getting married with two dependents smiling youre a good salesman but ive got to think about it
a good insurance salesman wouldnt give you time to think
with a smile and a quick kiss helen gets out of the car
as helen turns and hurries across the sidewalk to the house
in the entrance she turns and waves to tom
he waves back and drives off slowly
helen lets herself in with her key
the detective is putting on his hat and preparing to leave with klaatu as helen enters
there is a moment of awkwardness and confusion as she glances puzzled at the detective
bobby runs to her and greets her excitedly
she kisses bobby then turns questioningly to klaatu and the detective good evening mr
klaatu is uneasy but tries not to show it as he smiles in greeting and introduces the detective
benson this is mr
bradys a cop
helen glances quickly at the detective then at klaatu surprised and troubled
she turns to bobby to cover her confusion
to bobby did you have a nice day dear
enthusiastically boy we had a swell time
didnt we mr
we certainly did
we went to the movies and we had ice cream cones and we went to see daddy moved and grateful shes uneasy and concerned as she turns to klaatu i
dont know how to thank you
i enjoyed every minute of it
with quiet insistence we better get goin mr
as klaatu nods and prepares to follow him bobby speaks to klaatu
aw gee we didnt finish our story
well finish it tomorrow
klaatu and the detective nod to helen and they go out
helen watches the door close with real concern wondering why the police want klaatu and hoping he hasnt done anything wrong
still disturbed she turns to lead bobby upstairs
come on bobby
time to go to bed
he followers her then hesitates mom why does mr
carpenter have to go down to the police station
i i dont know dear
perhaps theres some mistake
this satisfies him for the moment even though it doesnt satisfy helen
he is climbing the stairs beside her
we sure had fun today
we saw the space ship and we went to see professor barnhardt and flashing him a puzzled incredulous look professor barnhardt
almost ignoring the interruption yeah sure
mom do i have to go to school tomorrow
of course dear
aw gee mom i had plans to play with mr
the place is crowded and there is a feeling of feverish but well ordered activity
unidentified people who have been picked up in the search for the space man are being screened by the police
they are all men all between forty and sixty years old and they are from all walks of life
a series of desks have been arranged in a row with signs over them reading identification
at each desk is a team of cops and before each desk is a line of men waiting to be screened
at the far end of the room klaatu can be seen at the desk of a police lieutenant with the detective who picked him up
shooting over the shoulders of two cops at one of the desks toward the line of people they are screening
a nondescript middle aged vagrant stands before the desk as one of the cops flips through a card file
to the cop beside him b
alberts no prior arrests
to the vagrant no identification
the man shakes his head dully send him over to g
the man is taken out of the line as camera moves on to the next desk with another pair of cops and another line
a rather distinguished looking business man is placing a sheaf of identification cards and papers on the desk
my wife just arrived with my identification
one of the cops at the desk glances over the papers and nods to the man
thatll be all mr
sorry to bother you
camera moves on to a third desk where a small rat faced man is standing uneasily before the two cops one of whom is flipping through a card file
cappo john c
the man nods two priors one for petty theft one for shoplifting
waving the man away okay jonny you can go
with a nervous grin sometimes a record comes in handy
and he moves off a detective lieutenant in plain clothes is questioning klaatu who stands beside the detective who brought him in
the lieutenant is a rugged but dignified man about fifty intelligent and businesslike
the professors secretary says she found you in barnhardts room making marks on his blackboard
i was only trying to be helpful
he was having difficulty with a problem
the lieutenant exchanges a look with the detective
sardonically oh i see
he was having trouble and you were helping him out
pleasantly thats right
quietly sharp and accusing i suppose you know that barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the army
in this case the secret wouldnt be worth much
he doesnt know the answer himself
growing impatient but i suppose you know the answer
with a deprecating shrug its really quite simple
the three body problem you know
the lieutenant shifts in his chair annoyed that he has to deal with this madman
he glances at a report on his desk trying to control his impatience
your names carpenter that right
klaatu nods any identification mr
drivers license social security number
no im afraid not
well how do i know who you are
secretly amused you dont
the lieutenant is turning away in exasperation as a uniformed cop comes into the scene
excuse me lieutenant pointing offscene the doc says this man needs treatment right away
a man about forty five bloodied and badly beaten is being supported and half carried by two policemen
a police doctor is guiding them to a doorway near which is a sign infirmary
the man is almost unconscious incapable even of holding up his head
whats the story
some fella caught him lookin in a window and figured he was the space man
the whole neighborhood went crazy and they ganged up on him
would have killed him if we hadnt come along
turns out he was just a prowler
the lieutenant grimaces his disgust and impatience with mob violence
okay book him and get him fixed up
the cops nods and goes and the lieutenant growls as he turns back to klaatu and the detective looks like everybodys goin nuts
appalled by what he has seen and heard they would have killed this man
gruffly people get hysterical enough they do anything
impatiently look mr
carpenter if you cant identify yourself i got to send you over to the army
pretending impatience but actually growing concerned how long will that take
they can tell right away
theyve got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital
to the detective take him over to g
really concerned now klaatu tries to find a way out
he attempts an authoritative air
its very important lieutenant that i see professor barnhardt
come on mr
carpenter shaking off the detectives hand klaatu speaks to the lieutenant
may i suggest that you call the professor
all patience gone get going will you brady before i get mad
the detective takes klaatus arm and leads him toward the door
as they go they pass a military police captain who makes his way straight to the lieutenants desk
as they come out of the station
klaatu hesitates a moment looks around
his face reveals nothing but he seems to be momentarily considering the idea of making a break
the detective sensitive to such a possibility hooks his arm under klaatus and nods his head toward the sidewalk in silent command
klaatu allows himself to be led off
as the detective leads klaatu across the sidewalk to the curb where a police car is standing
parked just behind it is an army staff car
as the m
captain appears in the entrance accompanied by the police lieutenant
they see klaatu and the detective approaching the police car and hurry out of scene after them
to the detective wait a minute brady indicating orders in his hand the captain heres got orders from general cutler to take this man over to professor barnhardt
to klaatu firmly but respectfully will you come with me sir
as klaatu gets out of the police car and the captain escorts him toward the staff car
passing the lieutenant klaatu speaks with a polite smile a smile that might be one of mild triumph
sorry to trouble you lieutenant
the lieutenant reacts with impatient exasperation as the captain holds the staff car door open for klaatu who steps into the army vehicle as we as the m
captain and klaatu enter the front door which is held open for then by hilda
she gestures them toward the half open door of barnhardts study where barnhardt can be seen puzzling over the problem on the blackboard
the captain knocks on the open door to attract his attention and enters with klaatu
barnhardt turns from his deep preoccupation at the blackboard chalk in hand
this is the man you wanted to see professor
studying klaatu curiously thank you captain
ill wait outside
he steps out into the hall closing the door
barnhardt continues to study klaatu for a moment then points to the notations he made on the blackboard
there is a controlled but anxious excitement in barnhardts attitude
you wrote this
nodding easily it was a clumsy way to introduce myself but i understand youre a difficult man to see
glancing at the blackboard reproachfully i thought youd have the solution by this time
thats why i wanted to see you
klaatu glances at the work barnhardt has been doing on the board
then he points to one of the expressions in an equation
all you have to do now is substitute this expression pointing to a specific place at this point
impressed and interested barnhardt tugs at his chin as he studies and weighs the results
slowly thoughtfully yes that will reproduce the first order terms
but what about the effect of the other terms
with variation of parameters this is the answer
how can you be so sure
have you tested this theory
with a slight smile i find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another
barnhardt stares at him blankly i understand youve called a meeting to study our space ship
as though unsure of what hes heard yes yes i have
my name is klaatu
noting that barnhardts expression is changing from amazement to incredulity i spent two days at your walter reed hospital
my doctors name was major white and i had a very attractive nurse called ruth whos getting married next wednesday
klaatu waits for this to sink in then speaks with quiet authority if you are not interested or if you intend to turn me over to your army we neednt
waste any more time
barnhardt hesitates for a long thoughtful moment
then he goes to the door opens it and speaks to the captain outside
to the captain his voice a little unsteady you can go now captain
please thank general cutler and tell him tell him that i know this gentleman
barnhardt closes the door and turns to find klaatu watching him with a faint smile
barnhardt sinks into a chair trying to adjust his mind
dryly you have faith professor barnhardt it isnt faith that makes good science mr
unable to conceal his interest sit down please
i have several thousand questions to ask you
ignoring the invitation i would like to explain something of my mission here
that was my first question
with some bitterness it was my intention to discuss this officially with all the nations of the earth but i was not allowed the opportunity
i have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society
gathering his thoughts we know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy
we also know that you are experimenting with rockets
yes that is true
in the hands of a mature civilization these would not be considered weapons of aggression
but in the hands of your people he shrugs and shakes his head weve observed your aggressive tendencies and we dont trust you with such power
puzzled if you mean that you are afraid of us with cool impressive emphasis we want to be sure you dont make let us say an unfortunate mistake
we know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children
you see weve had atomic energy for five thousand of your years
indicating the telephone we discarded instruments like this many centuries ago
he paces thoughtfully so long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves with your primitive tanks and planes we were unconcerned
but soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets
that of course we cannot tolerate
thoughtful and impressed these other planets do they have peace and security
we had our atomic wars thousands of years ago
he smiles wryly after that we fought with bows and arrows
then slowly we learned that fighting is no solution that aggression leads to chaos
with deep conviction we scientists understand this
even we primitive scientists
straightforwardly what exactly is the nature of your mission mr
i came here to warn you that by threatening danger your planet faces danger very grave danger
i am prepared however to offer a solution
would you care to be more specific
evenly what i have to say must be said to all concerned
with a suggestion of deference to barnhardt it is too important to be entrusted to any individual
barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept klaatus refusal to go any further
after a moments thought he speaks seriously but with a twinkle in his eye
i gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful
sternly as this unpleasant episode is recalled i come to you as a last resort and i confess that my patience is wearing thin
with jovian annoyance must i take drastic action in order to get a hearing
uneasily what what sort of action do you mean
violent action since that seems to be the only thing you people understand
quietly leveling the island of manhattan perhaps or dropping the rock of gibraltar into the sea
barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment passes his hand across his brow
then as klaatu watches barnhardt paces the floor trying to digest what he has heard
after a moment he turns to klaatu
would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists i am calling together
perhaps you could explain your mission to them and they in turn could present it to their various peoples
quietly evenly thats what i came to see you about
barnhardt flings him a glance then looks momentarily sheepish
but his own eagerness carries him on
he paces the floor thoughtfully
it is not enough to have men of science
we scientists are too easily ignored or misunderstood
we must get important men from every field
educators philosophers church leaders men of vision and imagination the finest minds in the world
i leave that in your hands
youd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting
no not at all
what about your personal safety in the meantime
what about the army and the police
my name is carpenter and im a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house
smiling but a little concerned im afraid i cant offer you any real protection
i have no influence in cases of inter planetary conspiracy
im sure ill be quite safe until the meeting
he suddenly pauses thoughtfully one thing mr
suppose this group should reject your proposals
what is the alternative
with a sense of quiet inescapable power im afraid you have no alternative
in such a case the planet earth would have to be he looks for the right word eliminated
the implications of this statement leave barnhardt speechless his keen mind reeling
such power exists
i assure you such power exists
barnhardt stands silent for a moment trying to collect his shattered thoughts
klaatu watches him as he starts pacing again
the people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this
they must understand what is at stake
after a thoughtful moment he looks up you mentioned a demonstration of force yes
would such a demonstration be possible before the meeting
yes of course
something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation
something that would affect the entire planet
with a nod that can easily be arranged
frightened by his easy assumption of infinite power i wouldnt want you to harm anybody or destroy anything
easily why dont you leave it to me
ill think of something
with a nervous half smile maybe a little demonstration
thinking about it something dramatic but not destructive
intellectually amused its quite an interesting problem
barnhardt nods vaguely would day after tomorrow be all right
say about noon
klaatus bland manner leaves barnhardt shaken almost wishing hed never started this business
it is about the following evening
helen is sitting in a chair leafing through a magazine
she is dressed to go out
a corner of the dining room can be seen where mr
barley are playing cards with mr
crockett the landlady enters from the hall on her way to the dining room and notices helen
going out dear
yes im waiting for tom to pick me up
with a shudder personally i wont go out after dark these days
with an attempt at slyness but then im not courting am i
she turns to go on into the dining room and as she does so almost bumps into klaatu who is coming out having been kibitzing the card game
thoroughly startled oh mr
klaatu steps aside as she hurries nervously into the dining room
he turns puzzled to find helen watching with a slight smile
everyone seems so he shakes his hands to indicate nervousness jittery is the word
helen watches him a little uneasy in his presence
she is fond of him and she cant help being curious and concerned about his brush with the police
with a contemplative smile bobbys the only person i know who isnt jittery
he has his homework to keep him occupied
fondly sincerely hes a fine boy mrs
naturally i think so
warm and friendly and intelligent thoughtfully you know hes the only real friend ive made since ive been here
helen is deeply moved by klaatus affection for the boy she tried to dismiss her curiosity about him but she cant
she decides to face it
hesitantly and with some difficulty mr
carpenter this is none of my business but why did that detective come here last night
with easy frankness oh they just wanted to ask me a few questions
bobby and i tried to see professor barnhardt in the afternoon but he wasnt in
apparently they thought i was looking for secrets of some kind
helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention of barnhardt
they are interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell
helen goes to answer it
as helen opens the front door to admit tom
he appears impatient anxious to get going
hello you ready
i will be in just a minute
a little annoyed that she hasnt her coat on he consults his watch the picture starts at eight fifty
in explanation i was talking to mr
lightly but with real sarcasm underneath i hope mr
carpenter wont think im intruding
helen tries to shush him to indicate klaatu is in the next room when klaatu appears in the doorway
he must have heard toms remark and there is an awkward moment
klaatu is completely unperturbed but helen is embarrassed
i was just going up to my room
guiltily goodnight mr
klaatu stops and turns to face them pleasantly
have a good time both of you
he goes on up the stairs
helen steers tom toward the living room
why dont you wait in here while i get my things
as they enter from the hall helen turns to tom reproachfully
quietly oh tom that was awful
momentary apologetic im sorry
i guess im just tired of hearing about mr
helen shushes him i dont like the way hes attached himself to you and bobby
after all what do you know about him
this touches on helens own private doubts and she cannot answer
ill go get my things
she turns quickly and goes into the hall and hurries up the stairs
tom looks after her dismissing the matter with a shake of the head and a philosophical sigh
of such stuff are women made
helen reaches the top of the stairs crosses to her room and grabs a coat off the bed
shes putting it on as she moves down the hall to bobbys room the door of which is open
bobby is at a table doing his homework and klaatu has just finished explaining an arithmetic problem to him as helen enters still putting on her coat
about to leave all you have to remember is first find the common denominator then subtract
to helen pleasantly ill say goodnight again
helen is embarrassed
she would like to apologize for the awkwardness downstairs but she doesnt quite know how to go about it
carpenter i its too complicated she cant do it goodnight
with a warm smile of complete understanding and appreciation goodnight my dear
he turns and goes out closing the door
a little distracted helen turns to bobby
go to bed darling
you can finish that in the morning
helen watches as he starts to put away his work
she wants to tell him something but finds it difficult to say
hesitantly almost guiltily bobby i think it would be better if we didnt see quite so much of mr
carpenter shocked and bewildered gee why mom
hes my best friend
and hes awful good in arithmetic
he even helps professor barnhardt
did you and mr
carpenter really go to see professor barnhardt
sure we did
he wasnt there but we went to see him
carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic
helen is surprised to get this corroboration for klaatus story
sensing his mothers uneasiness the boy looks for something intriguing some deep dark secret
shrewdly mom is there something wrong with mr
what do you mean dear
i mean on account of that policeman last night
his eyes light up hopefully you think hes a bank robber maybe
or a gangster
no dear of course not
hes a very nice man
i just think he might prefer to be left alone
now you get to bed and forget about it
she kisses him night darling
with a reassuring smile she starts for the door
stopping her in the doorway his imaginative suspicions mounting hey mom why would he want to be alone
not wanting to go into this any further helen blows him a kiss and backs out closing the door
bobby stands thinking for a moment his mind still speculating on all sorts of wonderful possibilities
still preoccupied he drifts over to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes
he drops the first one to the floor and is starting on the other when there is a light rap on his door
the door opens and klaatu appears
bobby have you a flashlight
surprised by his appearance and his request yeah sure
he goes to a drawer and gets a large hand flashlight its a real boy scout flashlight
bobby hands him the light studying his face with eager curiosity
what do you want it for mr
evasively why the light in my room went out
cutting off further questions thank you bobby
klaatu goes out closing the door behind him
bobby hesitates a moment puzzled and curious
then he goes over to the door flips off the lights and slowly noiselessly opens the door a crack so he can peer out into the hall
shooting down the hall through the crack in bobbys door
klaatus door is ajar and through it the lights in his room can be seen burning brightly
klaatu goes to his door reaches in and flips off the lights and closes the door
he then scans the hall in both directions
satisfied he isnt seen he moves surreptitiously down the hall toward the stairs still carrying the flashlight
as he closes his door carefully an expression of intense excitement on his face
what he has seem is certainly unmistakably suspicious
why did mr
carpenter lie to him
what does he want the flashlight for and where is he going
bobby decides hes got to find out
hurriedly he laces on the shoe he had taken off and peers out the door to find the hall clear
he slips out the door closing it behind him
klaatu is walking down the dark semi deserted street with the determined stride of a man with a definite objective
half a block behind hes following klaatu eagerly flushed with a sense of excitement and adventure
walking along the sidewalk klaatu turns into a side street disappearing from view around the corner
in a moment bobby hurries into scene breathlessly
he pulls up for a moment to rest
then getting his breath he dashes on around the corner after klaatu
this is a temporary structure that has been erected to enclose the space ship and gort
in front of the one small door are two soldiers standing guard
concealed in some foreground foliage studying the layout is klaatu
nearby s a sign reading keep out
this area off limits to the public
he is a short distance away watching klaatu eagerly
as he studies the situation
shooting over klaatus shoulder
as he watches a jeep filled with armed soldiers apparently regular patrol drives up to the entrance of the building
they stop for a moment while their sergeant checks with the guards
assured that everything is under control the sergeant signals his driver and the jeep moves off
scanning the side of the building he sees what hes looking for
waiting until the jeep disappears he starts toward one side of the building keeping himself concealed in the foliage
puzzled and interested as he watches klaatu
the two sentries standing in front of the building
as klaatu maneuvers around the side of the building where there is a window
it has no glass in it but is heavily barred
as he leaves the concealing foliage and crosses the clear grassy area surrounding the building
he stops and tries to see through the window
shooting through the barred window into the building
the huge robot looms large and eerie in the shadows cast by a couple of naked work lights
his head is angled away from the window
as klaatu approaches the window
aiming his flashlight at gort he flashes the light intermittently as though signaling
this should not approximate any known code
as we watch the intermittent flashes of klaatus light appear on the wall ahead of gort
slowly evenly the robots head turns to face the window
from gorts viewpoint of the window with klaatus light flashing its signals
shooting on his back as he finishes signaling and cuts off the flashlight
he turns ant starts back for the concealment of the foliage
craning his neck to look for klaatu who has eluded his view
suddenly he sees klaatu again
making his way behind the foliage toward the front of the building
arriving at a point opposite the entrance klaatu waits and watches
the two guards are standing in the doorway in positions of relaxed alertness
suddenly inside the building behind them the giant figure of gort looms silently in the doorway
his two great arms reach out grab the two guards and drag then back inside the building
he lets out an inaudible gasp as he sees this
bug eyed he glances quickly to the point where he last saw klaatu
he is amazed at what he sees
from bobbys viewpoint
klaatu has emerged from the concealment of the tree lined path and is making his way calmly toward the entrance of the building
as he watches klaatu enter the building his curiosity conquers his fear and he starts tremblingly toward the structure
as klaatu enters
the huge shapes of the space ship and gort loom large and eerie
klaatu starts across the barren enclosure toward the ship
as bobby approaches the door fearful but fascinated
he peers cautiously inside and his eyes grow wide as saucers
near the door the two guards lie unconscious
as klaatu walks toward the ship gort slowly turns his head to follow him with him with eyes
klaatu touches a point on the unbroken surface of the ship and the ramp silently swings out and down to the ground
klaatu mounts the ramp and disappears inside the ship whereupon the ramp silently closes
as he watches this his eyes bulging
he can scarcely believe what he has seen
suddenly a wave of sheer terror sweeps over him
scrambling to his feet he turns and runs wildly away
camera follows klaatu as he moves down the tiny dimly lighted entrance corridor
he steps into the main cabin of the ship and flips a switch which bathes the cabin in a diffused shadowless light
the walls are lined with a complex of mysterious gadgetry knobs dials indicators etc
all of this should be as imaginative and unorthodox as possible while still retaining a feeling of sound but highly advanced engineering
as klaatu moves to the communications panel flipping switches and turning dials
indicators light up
there are crackling whirring and buzzing sounds
klaatu starts speaking into a built in microphone in his own strange language
he speaks in rapid fire explanation continuing to talk as we as klaatu walks calmly away from the ship past the two unconscious guards and disappears out of the door
as one of them slowly regains consciousness
looking around he sees the great figure of gort and is terror stricken
he shakes his companion frantically in an effort to bring him to
bobby is curled up in a chair waiting for his mother to come home
hes sleepy but the excitement of what he has seen precluded any such possibility
from the hall we hear the front door opening as helen and tom come in
off scene why dont you come on in for a minute
helen and tom appear in the doorway helen is startled to see bobby who has jumped up and run toward her
what are you doing up at this hour
excitedly i couldnt go to sleep mom
i had to tell you
tell me what
the words tadpole out breathlessly i followed mr
carpenter right after you left and gee mom where do you think he went
right into the space ship
patiently disbelieving now bobby just a minute honest mom i saw him
it just opened up and he walked right in
and that great big iron man was moving around
bobby youve been dreaming again
desperately no i havent mom
i promise you
i saw it
helen and tom exchange a glance of tolerant amusement
where did you see all this bobby
on the lawn down at the mall in that place with the soldiers out front
trying to trap him where were the soldiers all this time
that robot fella grabbed em and dragged em inside
his lips trembling i like mr
carpenter but im scared mom
he rushes into helens arms clutching her desperately trying to hold back his tears
holding him close to her sympathetically mustnt be frightened darling it was just a bad dream
here well prove it to you
with a look and a nod to tom tom will you ask mr
carpenter if hell come down for a minute
tom turns to go the room right opposite mine
nodding tom disappears into the hall and up the stairs
still holding bobby helen tries to dispel his fears by an appeal to logic
now think back hard
you didnt follow mr
carpenter at all did you
you havent even been out of the house
yes i have
determinedly you didnt really see the space ship
you just thought you did
bitterly hurt bobby faces his mother gravely accusingly
id never call you a liar
tom is knocking softly at klaatus door
getting no answer he tries the door pushes it open and peers in
then he steps into the darkened room
tom snaps on the light and looks around the empty room
the bed is still made
glancing around toms eye is caught by a flash of something bright on the floor below the dresser
he stoops down and picks up a fair sized diamond
tom studies the stone curiously holding it up to the light
thoroughly puzzled he keeps the stone in his hand switches off the light and goes out
closing the door tom hurries along the hall and down the stairs through the hall door tom can be seen coming down the stairs
helen and bobby watch expectantly as he enters
hes not there
crossing to helen but look what i found in his room takes the stone and studies it amazed by its size is it real
with the shrug of an amateur looks real to me
carpenters got a lot of diamonds
he digs into his pocket he gave me a couple of them
helen takes the two diamonds bobby holds out in his hand looking at them in amazement
he gave these to you
guilty for his own sharp dealing well not exactly
i gave him two dollars
this doesnt make sense
i think the guys a crook
i never did trust him
helen tries to shush tom not wanting to re stimulate bobbys imagination but its too late
gee mom do you think maybe hes a diamond smuggler
firmly come on darling were going up to bed
i wonder if we ought to cutting him off with a look bobby and i have had enough excitement for tonight
seriously concerned you think its all right for you to stay here
nods reassuringly ive got a good lock on my door
smiling at bobby and bobbys going to sleep in my room tonight
oh boy can i mom
come on now
she happens to look down at his feet
puzzled and concerned she feels his shoes bobby your shoes are soaking
reluctantly with childish guilt yeah the grass was kind of wet
as the impact of this sinks in helen and tom turn to stare at each other in questioning consternation
it is a typical government office with lots of desks in it
helen is at her desk straightening it up to go to lunch
this done she moves briskly to get her coat
camera pans to follow her and suddenly startlingly reveals klaatu standing near the clothes rack as though he had materialized out of thin air
helen is thoroughly startled
unnerved oh hello may i see you for a minute
i i was just going to lunch
quietly insistent may i walk out with you
she is nervous and uneasy but obviously cant refuse
the telephone on her desk rings and helen turns to answer it
into phone mrs
recognizing the voice she glances nervously at klaatu oh hello
its a rather swank shop
tom is standing at the counter phoning
the jeweler is behind the counter examining a stone through his eyepiece
into phone cheerily im at bleekers getting an appraisal on that diamond
i thought we might have lunch together
with a nervous glance at klaatu i im afraid i cant not right now
can i talk to you later
yes thatll be fine
she hangs up and smiles uneasily as she rejoins klaatu and leads the way out into the corridor
camera moves with helen and klaatu as they go down the corridor
klaatus mood is one of quiet tension
watching helens reaction i saw bobby this morning before he went to school glancing at him apprehensively yes
i want to know what he told you last night
nervous and evasive i i didnt really pay much attention with a nervous little laugh bobby has such an active imagination
refusing to be put off did you believe what he told you
helen hesitates trapped by uncertainty i have a reason for asking this a very important reason
they are approaching the elevator at the end of the corridor
there is a large crowd of lunch goers milling around the elevator which is quickly filled
half the crowd is left as the elevator doors close and it descends
nervous and distracted helen doesnt want to get caught up in this jam
theres another elevator we can use she nods toward a side corridor and starts for it klaatu following
camera follows them as they turn into the side corridor
helen leads the way to a small automatic elevator
she presses the button and the doors open
klaatu follows her in
as helen presses the first floor button the doors close and the elevator starts down
she turns to face klaatu
her nerves raw and edgy what is it you want
before i ask you to be honest with me perhaps i should be completely honest with you without warning the elevator comes to a jolting jarring stop as the power
is cut off and the lights go out
the car is illuminated faintly and eerily by light that seeps through the ventilating grills from a skylight in the shaft
helen is terrified
gasping with fright what happened
a moments hesitation then he remembers what time is it
helen fumbles to get her wrist watch into a faint beam of light
well be stuck here for a little while about thirty minutes
preoccupied with her own thinking we could try pushing the other buttons
digging in her purse i have a flashlight in my purse
it wont work
helen has the flashlight out and is snapping it on but it doesnt work
she looks up at him blankly
after a moment quietly you see the electricitys been neutralized all over the world
the impact of this calm quiet statement is shattering
helen stares at him awe struck
then she speaks numbly almost inaudibly
bobby was telling the truth wasnt he
klaatu stares at her evenly as we all vehicular traffic in the street is at a dead stop
automobiles busses trolley cars all are stalled
drivers and passengers are climbing out of the vehicles in utter bewilderment
except for the people it is as though the street had been frozen in motion
the great generators and dynamos are silent and motionless in the dim unlighted plant
a huge automobile or airplane assembly line with nothing moving no machinery going
the giant presses are threaded with newsprint but they are silent and motionless
a couple of engineers are working feverishly over a huge and complicated control panel
they are working by the light of two incongruous and ineffectual candles
people carne pouring up the stairs wildly feverishly anxious to escape the darkness below
their eyes blink weakly in the unaccustomed sunlight
cars taxis and busses are stalled their frenzied drivers unable to figure out whats happened
a junk peddler with a broken down horse and wagon moves grandly and leisurely through the stalled vehicles
the peddler bears a happy grin of superiority
this is his moment of triumph over modern civilization
with all traffic stalled
of two cab drivers whose taxis have stalled beside each other in traffic
one has gotten out of his cab
the other is seated at his wheel looking around in awe and terror his tough manhattan heart shaken
my ol lady was right
we shoulda got a place in the country
with all traffic stalled
it is about p
standing on the sidewalk awe struck at the weird sight before them
one of them speaks in terror hardly daring to articulate his thoughts
its that space man thats wot it is
with all traffic stalled
it is about p
they are an elderly couple
staring bug eyed at the strange street scene the woman mutters some terror stricken comment in russian
with traffic stalled
it is about p
she is middle aged and there are tears of fright in her eyes
she is mumbling a prayer in french
barnhardt is seated comfortably at his desk with a book on his lap
he has been interrupted by the entrance of hilda his secretary
at the moment she s beside herself with excitement
barnhardt watches her with a half smile of secret amusement
he has already deduced the cause of whats happening
you should see it professor barnhardt
you should go out and see it for yourself
thanks im enjoying it right here
the whole city has stopped
people are running around like ants
musing admiringly on klaatus cleverness what a brilliant idea
i never would have thought of it
hilda flings him a questioning look annoyed that he wont share her excitement
what about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight
have they all arrived
nodding i talked to most of them this morning
they were all very curious about the meeting
did you speak to our friend mr
nodding hell be there at
studying her for a moment tell me hilda does all this frighten you does it make you feel insecure
yes sir it certainly does
nodding with a bland little smile thats good hilda
the poor woman flings him a look of shocked amazement as we seated at a conference table are high ranking officers of the army navy air force and marine corps
there is the uneasy tension of people dealing with unknown forces
an army major general whos chairman of the meeting is speaking
as far as we can tell all powers been cut off everywhere with a few exceptions hospitals planes in flight that sort of thing
i wish i could be more specific but as you now all communications are out telephone radio cable everything
gravely i can tell you that the president is prepared to declare a state of national emergency
pausing to let this sink in before we start discussing plans i want a report from colonel ryder
what about the robot colonel
ryder is a colonel of engineers a man about forty five
when it was discovered last night that the robot had moved i was directed by the joint chiefs to find a means of immobilizing him
we accomplished that this morning by encasing him in a block of kl
he hands a small block of plastic to the general its a new plastic material stronger than steel
is it possible that hes broken out of this stuff
ive just checked on that
hes locked up tight as a drum
all right that means we concentrate on the man
to the group with force and authority up till now weve agreed on the desirability of capturing this man alive
we can no longer afford to be so particular
well get him alive if possible but we must get him
eyes the group sternly is that clear
the shop and its glittering display cases which were brilliantly lighted in the previous scene are now gloomy and dim
all artificial light is off
the jeweler is a bright eyed old man of seventy with a middle european accent
he is completely fascinated as he examines the diamond tom has given him and is annoyed by the lack of light
he speaks impatiently to one of the girls in the shop who happens to pass by
eleanor did you call the electrician
shes not too bright i tried mr
but the phone doesnt work either
absently as he studies the stone well call the phone company
plaintively but the phone doesnt work
the jeweler gives her a preoccupied glance of annoyance and turns back to the stone
is it worth anything
i have never seen such a stone
will you please tell me where it came from
thats what i wanted you to tell me
overwhelmed and absorbed by the stone he shakes his head bewildered there are no diamonds like this any place in the world
impressed by the import of what the man is saying toms mind is racing wildly
you sure about that
eagerly shrewdly would you like to sell it
picking up the stone no no thanks
id give you a very good price
preoccupied with his own excited thoughts tom has already started for the door
in the dim light of the stalled elevator klaatu is finishing explaining to helen the story of his mission
overwhelmed by the staggering import of what he has told her helen is listening with great interest and concern
speaking gravely ive already told you more than i told professor barnhardt because my life in a sense is in your hands
i thought if you knew the facts youd appreciate the importance of my not being apprehended before the meeting tonight
helen is staring at him in awe but also in complete admiration and sympathy
yes of course
of course i do
klaatu smiles at her warmly and she manages to return the smile
their relationship is further cemented by the sharing of this vital secret
studying his face anxiously you hold great hope for this meeting
i can see no other hope for your planet
if the meeting should fail then im afraid there is no hope
suddenly and without warning the elevator starts moving and the lights go on
startled helen looks at him
calmly it must be twelve thirty
looks at her watch then back at him awe struck yes just exactly
showing a section of street traffic as it comes back to life
from everywhere comes the sound of self starters
trolley bells start clanging
then automobile horns
people climb back into there vehicles and traffic starts to move
of other streets as the strident sounds of traffic build up and normalcy is regained
as helen and klaatu come out of the elevator and start across the lobby camera holding on them
helen is preoccupied with concern for klaatus safety
where are you going now
back to the boardinghouse
ill be safe there for the afternoon and i can keep an eye on bobby
hes the only other person who knows anything about this recalls to helen something she had forgotten and she stops in sudden concern
no wait a minute theres someone else
he was there last night when bobby told me what he saw
the look of concern on klaatus face heightens helens overwhelming fear and uncertainty
worriedly of course he doesnt know anything definite
hed talk to me first anyway before interrupting herself in sudden decision we cant take that chance
ill get in touch with him right away and make sure
helen turns and starts determinedly for the lobby door followed by klaatu as we helen is nervous and worried as she speaks into the phone
into phone but ive got to talk to him
its terribly important
when is he coming back
toms secretary has not yet recovered from the shock of what has happened to the world
i dont know mrs
he left before noon before that awful electric business
im scared to death mrs
i no he wouldnt tell me where he was gong
said it was something personal
tell him i want to see him the minute he gets in
no ill call back
helen hangs up thoroughly worried and distraught now
the headline reads world wide power jammed president declares at passenger loading gate
a group of passengers is held back as soldiers close the gate to the runway preventing their boarding their plane
the passengers mill about in consternation as a voice is heard over a p
all flights from national airport have been canceled until further notice
all flights from this airport have been canceled
s are blocking the gates leading to trains and ticket takers are busy explaining matters and remonstrating with irate ticket holders
passengers are being herded off a loaded bus that was preparing to leave the depot
the army has thrown a roadblock across a main highway on the outskirts of the city and is permitting no one to leave
from the line of halted cars we see and the insistent honking of horns we hear we get the impression of hundreds of cars stacked up
it is p
and growing dark outside but the lights are not on
the office is small and unpretentious the business habitat of a man who works in a big insurance agency
toms secretary is on the phone reflecting the world wide terror of the moment
into phone nervous and jittery honest mary im so scared i cant sit still
id like to run some place but i dont know where to go hearing the door open she cuts off bye now
the corridor door opens and tom enters with an air of urgency
call the pentagon and find out whos in charge of this space man business
whoever it is i want to talk to him
the secretary has a reaction of surprise but she manages to stop tom at his door
he has flipped on the lights in passing
bensons been trying to get you all afternoon
she says its important
get this other call first
tom disappears into his office closing the door
the secretary is getting out a telephone directory when the corridor door opens and helen enters tense and nervous
benson he just walked in
misery loves company are you nervous too
yes i am margaret
the secretary buzzes the intercom and speaks into it
benson is here
turning to helen go on in
helen is starting for the door when it opens and tom appears
tom ive been trying to get you all afternoon preoccupied with his own excitement come on in
as tom follows helen inside and closes the door
he turns to her his voice tense with excitement
ive got some terrific news about your friend mr
trying to appear calm what about him
helen hes the man from the space ship
she eyes him evenly apprehensively as he hurries on i had that diamond checked at three different places
nobody on earths ever seen a stone like that
after what bobby told us thats enough for me
why is it nobody knows anything about him
why hasnt he got any money
evenly with quiet tension all right tom its true
i know its true
how do you know
never mind about that
urgently with great concern youve got to promise me you wont say a word to anybody
are you crazy
after what happened today
you dont understand
you dont realize how important it is
of course its important
the point is we can do something about it
thats what im trying to tell you
we mustnt do anything about it
believe me tom i know what im talking about
irritated by her opposition hes a menace to the whole world
its our duty to turn him in
desperately but he isnt a menace
he told me what he came here for
dismissing this with annoyed contempt he told you
dont be silly honey just because you like the guy
busy with his own thoughts you realize what thisd mean for us
id be the biggest man in the country
i could write my own ticket
eyeing him coldly is that what youre thinking about
guiltily defensive why not
somebodys got to get rid of him
they are interrupted by the sharp sound of the interoffice buzzer
im not going to let you do it tom
with deep personal urgency believe me this is literally the most important thing in the world
tom picks up the phone and answers it
into phone yes
whats his name margaret
disappointed that the connection isnt completed all right ill hold on
realizing what hes doing helen crosses to him pleading wildly desperately
tom you mustnt
you dont know what youre doing
it isnt just you and mr
the rest of the world is involved
exasperated i dont care about the rest of the world
it is as though he had slapped her across the face
suddenly he has revealed himself naked and distasteful
feeling guilty as he sees the contempt and revulsion in her eyes he tries the old charm holding his hand over the phone
youll feel different when you see my picture in the papers
staring at him starkly i feel different right now
uneasily you wait and see
youre going to marry a big hero
im not going to marry anybody
she turns and runs quickly out of the room
toms inclination is to follow her when his connection is completed
into phone hello general cutler
irritated no i dont want to speak to his aide
i want to speak to the general
tell him its about the space man
my name is tom stevens
s t e v e n s
helen hurries out of the building hails a cab gets into it and the cab drives off
tom now has general cutler on the phone
into phone thats right general
thats where hes staying
yes of course im sure
the general is on the phone and is making notes
there are a couple of officers standing near his desk a colonel and a lieutenant colonel
after listening for a moment thank you very much mr
ill want to talk to you further but i havent time now
hangs up and turns to colonel deploy all zone units according to plan b immediately
the colonel nods and starts out of the room as we the cab is traveling through city traffic
nervous and edgy helen glances at her watch impatiently
a jeep filled with armed soldiers is moving down the street at a fast clip
behind the jeep is an army staff car
shooting from outside into the car
in the front seat beside the driver is a full colonel wearing helmet and side arms
the car is moving swiftly through traffic as the colonel speaks into the transmitter of a radio
it is filled with soldiers wearing helmets and carrying rifles and tommy guns
it is traveling quite fast
a soldier with a handy talkie transmits an order to the driver
car is seen to be at the head of a convoy of eight army vehicles which are moving swiftly down the street
the trucks are filled with armed soldiers
on this street also an armed convoy is racing by headed by a jeep mounting a
caliber machine gun
on this street also a convoy rolls by
helens cab rounds the corner into the boardinghouse street
camera pans with cab as it draws up in front of the boardinghouse
the cab waits as helen jumps out and runs up the steps to the front door
a couple of children are playing jump rope in the light of a street lamp
shooting in at the colonel as he issues an order into the radio
camera follows the rear of the convoy as it races down a main thoroughfare
as the convoy reaches each intersection the last vehicle peels off the column and turns into the side street
racing down another street the rear vehicles peeling off at the intersections as in previous scene
following one of the vehicles after it has peeled off into a side street
it turns around in the side street and draws up facing the intersection its motor still running
we get the impression of a methodical plan to block off each street
as klaatu and helen come hurrying down the steps and pile into the waiting taxi
the kids playing jump rope stop and watch as the door is closed and the cab pulls out disappearing as it makes a right turn at the end of the
this is opposite end of street from last shot
barreling across the intersection into the boardinghouse street is the jeep followed by the colonels staff car
as the jeep and staff car pull up in front of the boarding house the soldiers in the jeep pile out and cover the entrance to the house
meanwhile the colonel still in the staff car is talking to the two kids playing out front
they chatter excitedly pointing in the direction taken by the cab
he speaks into his radio in tones of clipped and quiet efficiency
the car remains standing at the curb
into radio attention zone
yellow cab moving north on b from ninth street
man and woman in back seat
get the license number and report
the cab s moving through traffic at a normal speed
klaatu and helen are tense and nervous
the cabs moving through traffic at a normal speed
klaatu and helen are tense and nervous
im sure barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting
where is the meeting going to be
at the ship
as he looks out to his left approaching an intersection
from drivers viewpoint
car is parked in the side street facing the intersection its occupants armed and helmeted
abreast of the intersection now he looks to his right
shooting over the rear of a jeep which is halted in a side street facing the intersection
the cab crosses the intersection and the jeep driver squints to catch its number
then he picks up his radio and speaks into the transmitter
the car is still in front of the boardinghouse
the colonel listens to his radio for a moment then speaks into his transmitter
into radio attention zone
license number of target vehicle is w
all vehicles maintain your positions and hold your fire
shooting at the driver over the shoulders of klaatu and helen as he turns and points out the army vehicles to them with a shrug of bewilderment
they look ahead at the intersection they are approaching
looking ahead out of her side of the cab at the intersection
from helens viewpoint
there is an army vehicle waiting in the side street
as he looks out of his side of the cab
in this side street too an army vehicle is standing
their eyes meet for a moment neither willing to conjecture what this might mean
the very quietness of the operation is ominous and menacing
their faces show grave concern
into radio attention zone report when target vehicle passes your position
shooting through the window at helen and klaatu who are growing more tense and nervous
shooting over the back of a jeep mounting a machine gun as the cab passes the intersection
the driver picks up his radio and reports into it
shooting through the windshield as the driver reports by radio his eyes shifting to follow the moving cab
helen is biting her lips nervously
she steals a sidelong glance at klaatu to find him staring ahead deeply preoccupied and concerned
trying to give him encouragement its only a few blocks to barnhardts
im worried about gort
im afraid of what he might do if anything should happen to me
puzzled but hes a robot
i mean without you what could he do
slowly theres no limit to what he could do
he could destroy the earth
with great urgency if anything should happen to me you must go to gort
you must give him this message klaatu barada nikto
please repeat that
shocked and bewildered she repeats nervously klaatu barada nikto
gravely remember those words
helen nods repeating the words soundlessly
of vehicle drivers reporting by radio as their eyes follow the progress of the taxi
these should be shot so we dont hear what is said
listening to these reports
then he speaks into his transmitter with quiet tension
into radio attention zone
section number block off tenth street at massachusetts
all vehicles close in
the colonel motions to his driver and the staff car pulls out
as a convoy of eight vehicles moves down the street going very fast and swings around a corner
of individual vehicles that have been waiting at intersections as they pull out and down the main streets to converge on the taxi
at a major intersection as the convoy of eight vehicles previously seen dashes through the intersection and stops
the cars quickly arrange themselves so that they form a roadblock completely sealing off the street
shooting over the drivers shoulder
the cab is proceeding down the street
when the road block comes into range of its headlights
the driver who has been getting uneasy turns to face his fares accusingly
hey whats this all about
as he slows his cab down helen leans forward into scene
frenzied she is about to urge the driver on when klaatu puts a restraining hand on her shoulder
shooting down the street from the barricade as the taxi stops
army cars are closing in behind the taxi so it is trapped
the cab door ovens and klaatu steps out making a run for the entrance to a pedestrian underpass
it is one of the lead vehicles in the group coming up behind the taxi
it mounts a
caliber machine gun and with the jeep still moving the gunner fires a burst at klaatu
hes on one of the vehicles that form the barricade
he takes a bead on the running figure of klaatu and fires
he has almost reached the underpass
his hand is on the railing when he slumps to the ground badly hit
in a moment helen rushes into scene dropping down to hold klaatus head in her arms
he looks up at her with a feeble smile
then his face takes on an expression of urgency
weakly insistently get that message to gort
right away klaatu is unable to say any more
he is dead
helen looks around wildly helplessly with tears and terror in her eyes
as the soldiers pile out of their vehicles and close in on the place where klaatu lies
he is their first and all important concern and helen finds herself pushed out of the way toward the edge of the growing crowd of soldiers
shocked and staggered by whats happened she realizes she must get to gort
taking advantage of the milling confusion in the dark she edges toward the pedestrian underpass until she can slip into its entrance without being noticed
and she disappears
in the eerie light of the huge building the great robot stands encased in a solid block of clear transparent plastic
as camera moves in slowly we hear a low whirring sound as of power being generated
a faint glow visible through the plastic emanates from gorts body
his eyes which seem to express rage shifts as though he were straining to break out
as the whirring sound and the glow of gorts body increase in intensity the sharp edges at the top of the ice like block melt into roundness and the plastic
starts to drip away
about folding chairs are arranged on the floor near the space ship for the meeting tonight
the whirring sound can be heard faintly from inside
the two soldiers standing guard at the door hear the sound and listen apprehensively
the two men exchange an uneasy glance
after hesitating a moment one of them decides to investigate
he turns and goes inside the door
as he stops and looks up at the robot his eyes go wide with terror
gort is an awesome and terrifying sight
his head is free now and he seems to be straining against the plastic which is dripping down the sides of the block
he glances around nervously to see that his companion has entered the building and is staring up at the robot bug eyed
slowly the second soldier moves up beside the first
wordlessly they bring their rifles up to the ready and click them off safety
in spite of their terror they advance slowly toward the robot
the whirring sound is ominous and his body glows brightly
and his eyes are fixed on the two advancing figures
as they move toward gort
from inside him comes a new and terribly sharp crackling
and from his eyes two pencils of light dart out
after a moment the crackling sound stops and the light goes off
from same angle as scene before last
but the two soldiers have utterly disappeared
as gort resumes breaking out of the plastic
there is no sign of the two soldiers
hurrying along a footpath nervous and distraught she pauses for a moment looking at the entrance of the building
then she starts determinedly across the grass toward the entrance
panning with helen as she approaches the entrance fearfully
rallying all her courage and determination she forces herself to step inside
as she enters the huge weirdly lighted building
she stops short as her glance falls on the awesome figure of gort
loneliness and terror grip her and she wants to run but she realizes she cant
he has seen helen and his flashing eyes bore into her
his upper body and arms are free now and the plastic is rapidly melting away
she is held fascinated by the robots staring eyes
for another moment it looks as if she would break and run
but she summons all her courage and moves slowly toward gort whose legs are still held captive
as she moves slowly fearfully toward him
the plastic is dripping off his legs now
with great effort he pulls his legs free and steps out of the stuff
a huge figure in the heavy shadows he moves slowly and menacingly toward helen
as she stops advancing rooted to the spot in fear
then she starts backing away keeping her eyes on him
as the great hulking figure approaches helen cant stand her ground
she turns and runs wildly toward the far end of the building
gort follows her with unhurried inescapable strides
unwittingly helen has run into a corner and the robot is closing in on her
her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes shes trapped
in a wild effort to run around him she stumbles and falls to the floor
immobilized with fright she lies breathless looking up at him
then she gives a piercing scream
as the great robot bends over her menacingly arms outstretched as though to grab or smash her
all hope gone she is blessed with a moment of lucidity and she remembers the message klaatu told her to deliver
with desperate clarity klaatu barada nikto
he pauses as he hears the words
his face doesnt change expression but the words obviously have an effect on him
he hesitates thoughtfully for a moment
helen watches him in an agony of suspense
then the robot slowly bends down picks her up in his arms and starts walking toward the space ship
panning with gort as he carries helen speechless with fright to the side of the ship
he touches the side and the ramp moves slightly out
he mounts the ramp still carrying helen and disappears into the ship with her
and the ramp closes silently behind them
camera follows as gort carries helen through the dimly lighted corridor into the main cabin where he flips a switch that lights up the cabin
the robot proceeds to a small door leading off the main cabin and disappears with helen inside it
this is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory the walls of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical and electronic apparatus
gort sets helen down on a stool and indicates for her to stay there
too terrified to move helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus
he starts flipping switches and turning dials
as a result lights begin to flash and theres a strange series of mechanical noises
unable to guess the reason for these preparations she is gripped with a terrible fear
ignoring helen completely gort finishes his work
then he moves to the door and goes out closing the door behind him
helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the knob only to find to her terror that there is none
frenziedly she beats on the solid metal door
as the ramp comes down and gort steps out
with grim determined strides he starts toward the entrance of the building as the ramp silently closes
the colonel who was in charge of klaatus apprehension is speaking into a phone at the desk of the police sergeant
standing by are three or four army officers among them a captain and a lieutenant
into phone yes sir weve got the body here now
downstairs in a cell
no question about it general hes dead all right
yes i understand
the general has apparently hung up and the colonel does likewise turning to the officers in the room
general cutlers coming down here right away
to the lieutenant take a squad of men lieutenant and post a guard around that cell
to captain captain dont let anyone in or out of the building
the two officers mutter their yes sirs and start off about their business
a squad of armed soldiers led by the lieutenant is admitted to the corridor by a police guard and they start marching down the corridor toward a cell at the
this is a cell on the ground floor
in the far wall is a heavily barred window beyond which is as alley
are klaatus feet stretched out on a crude table
as camera holds the huge figure of gort appears outside the barred window seeing klaatu he reaches up and yanks out the steel bars as though they were chicken wire
with a crushing blow of his knee he crumbles the brick and mortar below the window and steps inside the cell
he moves without interruption toward the body of klaatu
hearing the sounds of clattering metal and mortar the soldiers race down the corridor toward the cell
shooting over the backs of the soldiers as they reach the cell and look inside
there they see the giant robot picking up the body of klaatu and starting deliberately toward the gaping hole in the side of the building
they raise their weapons and fire at gort but the bullets have no effect on him
continuing uninterruptedly he steps over the debris and disappears carrying klaatu in his arms
as gort enters the empty building still carrying the body of klaatu
camera pans with him as he strides over to the ship
the ramp opens and gort goes inside
then the ramp closes after him
alone in the cabin helen is still terrified
she looks up startled as the door opens and gort enters carrying klaatus body over to a long counter
once again he starts fiddling with knobs switches and dials
as helen watches speechless he starts to fasten strange looking electrodes to klaatus wrist and ankle
shooting from the outside near the front entrance to the building through a window into the main room where the police sergeants desk is
the lieutenant who was ordered to guard klaatus cell is excitedly reporting to the colonel how gort broke in and took klaatus body
considerably agitated the colonel snaps orders to the other officers glances at his watch and motions for the lieutenant to follow him
he and the lieutenant cross to the door and camera pans with them as they come outside the building hurry down the steps and get into a staff car
several other army vehicles join the staff car as it roars away from the curb
a good many of the chairs are filled and more guests are still arriving
there is no one to greet them at the door so they wander in and seat themselves
gort is still working over the body of klaatu
from a socket in the wall he pulls a strange looking hypodermic needle on the end of a cord or tube and gives klaatu a shot in the arm
as she watches fascinated in spite of her terror
gort fiddles with the dials again and there are electrical cracklings and sputterings
suddenly he flips a switch and all sound ceases
gort removes the electrodes and watches klaatu
camera moves in on klaatu and we see him start to breathe
in a moment his eyelids flutter
then his eyes open and he looks around
as klaatu slowly lifts himself to a sitting position
helen watches breathlessly as he glances around the room as though to orient himself
then he lowers his feet to the floor and stands up
he blinks uncertainly then smiles at them
with a grateful glance at gort he turns to helen hello
staring at him i i thought you were nodding with a smile i was
looking at gort in awe you mean he has the power of life and death
no that is a power reserved to the almighty spirit
indicating the equipment gort used this technique in certain cases can re stimulate life for a limited period
its a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people
concerned for him but how how long
how long will i live
he shrugs that no one can say
klaatu moves one of the sliding panels and reaches for a suit of his other world clothing from behind the panel
with a nod of apology he steps behind the panel to change
shooting from the door
barnhardt who has just arrived is greeting several friends outside the door
a staff car and three or four other army vehicles are driving up
as the convoy pulls up to a halt in front of the building the colonel hurries out of the staff car and moves over to barnhardt
barnhardt is motioning his friends into the building as the colonel comes up to him
the colonel speaks to barnhardt with deference but with unyielding authority
im sorry professor barnhardt i have to ask you to call off this meeting
call it off
but i had permission from the army i know you did
but the robots on the loose now and it isnt safe around here
youll have to get your friends out of that building
as klaatu steps out from behind the sliding panel where he has changed into his other world tunic
gort and i will be leaving soon
helen is genuinely upset at the thought of his leaving and the knowledge that he is to die
there is a compelling warmth of feeling between these two
simply sincerely well miss you very much bobby and i
smiling to conceal her real feelings he wont have anyone to play with
hell have you and tom
quietly definitely no
thats all finished
she is sensible and objective but not unfeeling i think im very lucky
you dont always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it
klaatu looks at her in warm considered admiration
then he moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch
suddenly an entire section of the side wall is made transparent
through it as through a screen we can see out into the building
most of the chairs are already occupied and latecomers are still moving in through the door
facing the group on a little dais is barnhardt
as klaatu and helen watch barnhardt raps for order and begins to speak
his voice comes in the ship through a speaker
ladies and gentlemen he addresses them gravely with a note of terrible disappointment in his voice
i called you from your work and from your homes all over the world because we were to meet here tonight with a man from another planet the man who
came here in this ship
there are audible exclamations of surprise and disappointment as you all know this is no longer possible
i can only say that i share the bitterness of your disappointment
intercut with the above are group and individual shots of the people in the meeting
they are the cream of earths intellectuals scientists churchmen educators leaders of social and political thought
there are several women among them
there are turbaned indians chinese japanese several negroes
all religions are represented
every important world power is represented
klaatu and helen are watching and listening as the last sentence of barnhardts speech above comes over the speaker
klaatu flips off the switch which cuts off the view of the meeting and also barnhardts voice
at this moment gort moves across the cabin and klaatu speaks to him
gort moves off obediently
full of chagrin he continues addressing the meeting
under the circumstances the army people have asked us to leave the building
and since their concern is for our safety i can do nothing but suggest that we comply barnhardt is interrupted by the sudden and unexpected appearance of the ramp silently
opening out of the side of the space ship
as they react in startled amazement to the mysterious appearance of the ramp
then as they watch there is a sudden gasp of terror
as gort appears on the ramp and walks slowly down to the ground
in a moment klaatu and helen appear at the entrance of the ship
helen comes down the ramp to join barnhardt while klaatu remains at the head of the ramp
the colonel stands near the door flanked by a group of soldiers their rifles at the ready
the colonel is startled by what he sees
his eyes are on the revered figure of klaatu and hes debating what he should do
he is a figure of intense dignity in his impressive otherworld tunic
he stares with even defiance at the armed soldiers as though holding them off by sheer weight of his personality
he turns to look out at the audience which is held spellbound
then after a breathless moment he speaks
straightforwardly with almost stern authority i am leaving soon and you will forgive me if i speak bluntly
he pauses studying the faces the universe grows smaller every day and the threat of aggression by any group anywhere can no longer be tolerated
of three of the delegates listening intently
these three are from russia india and france
over scene there must be security for all or no one is secure
this does not mean giving up any freedom except the freedom to act irresponsibly
he is an american
over scene your ancestors knew this when they made laws to govern themselves and hired policemen to enforce them
we of the other planets have long accepted this principle
we have an organization for the mutual protection of all planets and for the complete elimination of aggression
a sort of united nations on the planetary level
the test of any such higher authority of course is the police force that supports it
for our policemen we created a race of robots indicating gort their function is to patrol the planets in space ships like this one and preserve the peace
in matters of aggression we have given them absolute power over us
emphasizing his great size and inscrutable expression
the normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably at the audience is his only movement
over scene at the first sign of violence they act automatically against the aggressor
and the penalty for provoking their action is too terrible to risk
the result is that we live in peace without arms or armies secure in the knowledge that we are free from aggression and war free to pursue more profitable enterprises
after a pause we do not pretend to have achieved perfection but we do have a system and it works
with straightforward candor i came here to give you the facts
it is no concern of ours how you run your own planet but if you threaten to extend your violence this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned
of four delegates reflecting their stark terror and bewilderment
and a cut of the colonel and the soldiers impressed and held by what klaatu is saying
camera moves slowly as he concludes quietly incisively
your choice is simple
join us and live in peace
or pursue your present course and face obliteration
after a pause we will be waiting for your answer
decision rests with you
by the time he reads the last line the camera has moved into a big head closeup
camera moves along a row of their faces stunned and silent their minds unable to cope with the enormity of what they have heard
camera moves in on klaatu as he is saying goodbye to barnhardt and helen
he turns then and speaks to gort glancing up at the building as he does so
he looks up at the roof of the building and once again we hear the peculiar generating sound from within him
including the delegates the space ship everything that is inside the building
as we watch the roof and walls of the temporary structure suddenly disintegrate as the tanks did in the opening
the entire layout delegates space ship and all remain exactly as they were except that instead of being under a roof they are out in the open mall under a
the area is ringed with the debris of the building
klaatu is standing at the head of the ramp as gort comes up the ramp and disappears inside the ship
klaatu is nodding goodbye to barnhardt and helen
as they wave to klaatu
barnhardt is moved and impressed and helens face shows her emotions at this strange parting
he nods and smiles at them with warm affection
then he turns and disappears into the ship and the ramp closes behind him
from inside the ship comes the muffled roar of great power generating not the sound of earthly motors but of a tremendous dynamo
watching breathless stunned by what they have heard and seen
as the sound from inside it builds to a climax the great ship takes off with a tremendous roar
all are deeply moved and impressed
in the mind of each is the burning question that klaatu has posed for them
as it soars away into the inky blackness of the outer spaces from which it came
