written by ron shelton based on material by al stump july draft do not go gentle into that good night old age should burn and rave at close of day
rage rage against the dying of the light
dylan thomas nice guys finish last
leo durocher the room is california spanish thick walls arches and light spills in from a mission window
but we dont have any sense of place just yet
at first there are just details
of an old underwood upright well worn and ancient
a womans fingertips with red nail polish are placed on the keys
a mans hand picks it up
on a coat rack
overflowing with crunched up paper
lies on a couch near the window
he stands up suddenly and looks out the window
al stump is sharply dressed tie dress shirt cufflinks
hes staring at something
in high heels crosses the courtyard
she glances up toward stump then quickly turns away and disappears
he sighs and turns
the muse has not descended lucille
off her silence the muse has not descended
off her silence god damn it lucille you hear me
the woman at the typewriter a year old steno secre tary responds calmly
the muse has not descended
the muse has left me stranded here like a beached whale only one phrase one word from finishing the greatest essay ive ever written
one word the right word flaubert called it le mot juste i ever tell you that
lucille is a longsuffering saint
le mot juste the exact right word the writer needs to tell his story
yessir youve mentioned it
hemingway faulkner joyce they all searched for le mot juste until they cried until they bled
what is this essay about again
i mean what is it really about
you said it was about the quote unquote primal issues of survival man against nature etcetera thats what you said
we end the essay with
dictating the tarpon leaps shimmering into the late cross light of the keys a primeval moment frozen in
hesitates frozen in
lucille types it out
shimmering tarpon very good mr
beat frozen in what
patiently i dont know lucille thats what the muse will tell me if she ever descends
considering frozen in
the phone rings lucille answers it
just a minute ill see if hes available
covers phone its your wife are you and she speaking again
stumps cavalier attitude stops cold
he starts to reach for the phone then stops
how does she sound
dont ask me to interpret
stump is suddenly a nervous wreck

serious dark god damn it
on phone apparently hes out mrs
stump ill have him call you back
she hangs up
the mood has shifted
i need a drink
what about le mot juste mr
snaps fuck le mot juste lucille

the primeval moment is frozen in whatever the hell you want it to be
did you know that james joyce let his secretary none other than samuel beckett revise and edit mollys solliloquy in ulysses
youre my beckett i give you le mot juste
just get the damn thing in the mail so i can get paid
problems with the mrs
stump reaches for a beat up pogo stick which leans against the wall in his office
i dont know
i need a drink
he grabs his hat and coat and we begin hearing the number one hit song of percy faiths schmaltzy recording of a summer place
stump pogo sticks down the sidewalk tipping his hat to pedestrians
theyre not alarmed
hes the town eccentric
he pogos across a street and towards
a watering hole like a million others
he pogo sticks right in the front door
a classic city bar a hangout for drunks philosophers and especially sportswriters and journalists
our man hops off his pogo stick nobody even notices and joins his cronies five sportswriters full of dogmatic opinions on every subject known to man
frank a sportswriter is at the jukebox feeding quarters
he looks up routinely theyre all regulars here
stump addresses the sportswriters at the table as if they were a small audience in a lounge
how do you get five old ladies to say fuck
stumped jeez i dunno how
the others groan
reynaldo s black speaks up
hes one of the regulars
okay i got one beat a drunk is taking a piss in front of a bar a bus drives by real fast right along the curb and knocks his thing
drunk picks up his thing puts it in his pocket goes into a bar reaches into his pocket and puts his thing on the bar
lookt that he says bus knocked my thing off
bartender says that aint your thing thats a cigar butt
drunk reaches into his other pocket and slaps another thing on the bar
there he says bus knocked my thing off
bartender says youre drunk and that aint your thing either
thats another cigar butt
beat drunk looks down at both cigar butts and back up at the bartender and says god damn it i mushta smoked my dick
everyone roars even stump
but frank as usual is hyper serious and never quite gets into the revelry
amidst this levity gentlemen i have some real concerns
mark my words people will look back on this year and say that was the year that western civilization began its downward trajectory
you need to get laid frank
guys guys cmon
do you really think things are as good as they used to be
you think jack kennedy is qualified to be president
kennedy may not be qualified but jackies a babe and thats good enough for me
theyre a happily married couple and that oughta stand for something these days
every man nods in solemn agreement
speaking of being happily married al are you and your old lady still having problems
oh no the wife and i are all patched up doin fantastic
good to hear
way to go stumpy
i mean look at us we call ourselves writers but we just watch ballgames and get drunk a lot
you call that writing
yes i do
in the department store of life sports is the toy department so what
yeah besides alan heres writing a serious novel arent ya
yeah well i havent started yet but im gonna
ive been busy
you guys are pathetic
ya write for one reason a paycheck
more art was created for money than for passion
take your platitudes and shove em frank
im gonna write a novel too someday
cynically the great american novel i suppose
it could come from my pen
youre a barbershop writer al you write sugar coated pieces for guys to skim when theyre waiting for a haircut
awright thats it
settle this right here
stump raises his fists as if to fight frank responds
a scuffle breaks out a lot of posturing feinting but theyre all too chicken to do anything
nobody wants to fight
a phone rings at the bar
the bartender answers the phone shouts at the obnoxious sportwriters
stump goes to the phone interrupting his own fight
to frank phone call saved your ass
stump grabs the phone covering an ear to hear better
on phone yeah
stump hangs up the phone and turns
his face registers shock or more precisely bewilderment and wonder
as they ignore him shut up
they do and give stump their ruffled attention
cobb wants to see me
how many cobbs are there
this news instantly sobers the room
i thought he was dead
he said he wants to tell me the real story of his life before he croaks
you were just talking to ty cobb
the georgia peach himself
this impresses the hell out of everyone in the room
even stump is still a little dazed
they say cobb is crazy
the meanest sonofabitch who ever lived
i heard he killed a man
maybe so but he was the greatest baseball player of them all
yeah the best no one close etc
frank suddenly is cautionary concerned paternal
listen al be careful i aint gettin my ass shot dont worry
no not that the story
beat this is like ivan the terrible inviting somebody into the czars palace before he died
except ivan was a nicer guy
concerned earnest dont let cobb bullshit you
this is your shot
this is all our shot
as cronies agree when does he want to see you
al stump sits alone in the theater except for a teenaged boy sweeping the aisles who stops to watch the screen
i gathered all the film footage that existed on cobb which wasnt much and rented the local theater for the afternoon
beat i too had thought that the great ty cobb had been dead for awhile
the screen fills with b w movietone newsreel footage of ty cobb complete with overly sincere narration and music
this cameo of an year old youth shows a peaches and cream complexion and the piercing eyes of a lad who would become etc
onscreen b w cobb as a young ballplayer followed by images of cobbs famous batting stance cobb clowning etc
his reputation as being difficult at best psychotic at worst preceded him
but if there was one thing i knew after all my years as a journalist covering politicians celebrities and sports heroes it was this
onscreen b w cobb with children cobb with celebri ties cobb in a parade honoring him and always cobbs dashing swashbuckling style of play
the facts and public perception of those facts frequently bear little resemblance
onscreen b w cobb in action his demon fury gives way to the fierce joy of his playing
he slashes a ball up the alley turns first and never hesitates at second and as the relay comes into third one thing was beyond argument he was the most
brilliant athlete of his time
perhaps of any time
beat i was determined to find out who was the real ty cobb
cobb slides with spikes high and a cloud of dust
there is something thrilling and terrifying in the image
stumps car a late model buick moves across the stunning grasslands at the western base of the sierra nevadas
we begin hearing his voice then see him inside the car driving
stumps car heads up into the darkening mountains
they said cobb owned property all over the country but in recent years had been staying in his hunting lodge at lake tahoe in the sierra nevadas
moving up into the sierras into rugged terrain and thick forests
stump straining to see the road a bit wary of this drive
driving into the sierras at night with winter coming on wasnt the smartest decision id ever made but it seemed better than being late for my first meeting with cobb
first drops of rain begin hitting the windshield stump hits the wiper button and the floppy blades begin ineffectively wiping the windshield
stump struggles with his vision
a dismal wet and obscured view of the mountain road climbing higher into the sierras
a small roadside gas station comes into view and stump pulls his car into the station
stump gets out blows on his hands
its cold and a man comes out the gas station owner jonah
the man services the car throughout the conversation
fill it up and replace the wiper blades
you got it
colder than a witchs tit eh
its just starting
we got three four feet of snow another thousand feet up
where ya going
i hate skiing
actually im going to meet ty cobb
he stopped here for gas once i asked him for an autograph for my boy and he told me to shove it where the sun dont shine
i hear hes got a way with kids
stump heads to a pay phone as the attendant replaces the wiper blades
stumps breath hangs heavy in the air
he drops a set of coins in the call box
he blows on his hands and pulls up his collar he wasnt prepared for the weather to be this cold
he comes to life when he hears a voice on the other end a voice we never hear
hey baby its me
beat im up in the woods somewhere on assignment
beat listen sweetheart listen nobody can love you the way i love you and i want you to take me back
i made a mistake
listens okay lots of mistakes
i know im not worthy
we hear a click
he flicks the receiver hook several times
rain pounds down as the car climbs to higher elevation
stump struggles with a map under the dome light as he drives
stumps car passes a sign that tells all donner pass
i confess i was looking forward to seeing cobb and being near his brilliance
my own life seemed on hold somehow
everyday churning out the same old articles drinking at in the afternoon with the same old guys the same old excuses for not writing a novel the same old confused
marriages that we all needed and were trying to get out of at the same time
cobb was a god whose brilliance however difficult could rub off on me
his problems were different than mine
which pulls off the road and heads up a small mountain road among snow covered pines
a row of mailboxes catches stumps attention and he pulls over to review the names with a flashlight
he lights his way across the names of a dozen boxes nothing until the last box enormously oversized bears the name cobb
his car heads up a mountain road a final hundred yards comes around a bend in the trees and there it is
in the grand style but like the mailbox grotesquely oversized
stump parks and approaches somewhat warily
the sound of breaking glass and shouting voices
stump hurries to the door to escape the rain and finds refuge under the eave
the noise is frightening from that close
he stands unsurely does he knock
when the door is thrown open a black man willie with a suitcase stands wildly upset screaming back into the house
fuck you mr
cobb i have too much dignity to spend another moment with you
i hope you die before the sun comes up and may you rot in hell
the man whirls and is shocked to see stump standing there with his own suitcase
who are you
im a writer
you mean he actually found somebody to take the job
willie bursts out into crazed laughter as if the world of cobb was finally too absurd
cobb and a writer
in this weather
in any weather
and the man walks through the rain laughing heading on foot down off the mountain as stump just stares
stump turns and steps into the open doorway
stump in the front door the place is enormous and barely lit
taxidermied game hangs on the wall
stump is terrified
a man is sitting in an overstuffed chair reading a news paper
dressed in a business suit and tie he seems oblivious to the surrounding chaos
he also seems out of place
the man looks at stump and points upstairs without speaking
more crashing sounds from upstairs
the silence is shattered by a scratch then violin music from upstairs
static suggests a record is playing
stump climbs the stairs with caution until hes just outside the half open door from which light spills
a gunshot rings out ripping through the door
stump is terrified he gasps for air
thank you very much mr
cobb but i dont need this job that bad
stump turns and creeps back toward the stairs but another gunshot rings out shattering a hanging lamp
stump freeses one more time
then the voice yes mr
stump you do need this job that bad
beat now come in here and meet the great ty cobb
calmly i wont hurt you
stump breathes deeply and steps into the doorway he does it as if theres no choice accepting his fate
and sees lying in bed in a robe
bottles of booze and food everywhere
and bottles of pills sit on every surface
two hunting dogs sit on the bed with him
a small record player sits next to he bed
a record spins filling the room with fritz kreisler violin solos
he places the gun on his night table knocking pills and bottles to the floor with a crash he barely notices
when he speaks it is without a snarl without threat simply even sweetly he says on the violin fritz kreisler
im a great admirer of his
im also a great admirer of yours
but you are a hopeless romantic and only a moderate success
sir i am the most successful sportswriter in america and not merely a moderate success
beat give me those pills over there
stump retrieves some pills that cobb is pointing towards
cobb washes down a handful of pills with a bottle of scotch
momentarily revitalized cobb hands stump a folded letter which stump opens to read
thats an invitation to a testimonial dinner at the baseball hall of fame in cooperstown new york
youre taking me there when is it
looking at the letter a few weeks
all the great ones will be there the great mickey cochrane will be there
hornsby sisler ott the waner brothers
we used to have some parties stump ill tell ya that right now
beat we cant forget
i wont forget
look at me closely al
with utmost sincerity lie after lie has been written about me my whole life ive been misunderstood
beat youre gonna tell the real story of ty cobb
whats the real story
cobb climbs slowly out of bed
his words are reasoned and not without passion
thats why youre here
beat see theres two kinds of writers
the kind that spin endless yarns about small subjects
theres the kind with one great subject that consumes them forever
beat that could be you
because i am that subject
cobb hobbles to a table in front of a window
the table is covered with pills bottles needles and booze
suddenly bellowing jameson
get your ass up here
cobb grabs another bottle of booze and swigs deeply liquor spilling over him
then suddenly he holds up his hand
a calm comes over him as he stares out the window into the snowy woods
his rage has quickly turned into a quiet intense unsettling focus
near the lodge
a bank of snow and a large buck moves into view
his eyes light
a flare in his nostrils
and utter calm
jameson the man in the suit arrives and stands in the back of the room
he takes notes when cobb speaks
cobb continues staring out the window at the buck
theres a small oil company near bakersfield called honolulu oil sitting near the elk hills reserve
beat i want you to buy all the stock you can
getty is expanding in the west looking for companies like that
i got a hunch
beat stumpy cmere
cobb picks up the revolver and holds it lovingly
stump crosses and stands behind cobb sharing the view
i can take that buck
with a pistol
cobb smiles and loads the revolver
he pushes the window which swings slowly open
searches for leaves to eat in the snow
to jameson theres a board meeting of coca cola in georgia next week
call them up and tell them i cant make it for medical correcting himself personal reasons
beat and sell all the m stock we got
raises the gun he wobbles badly and steadies himself
the gun shakes
stump stands over his shoulder watching the bizarre action
the revolver fires with a violent kick
the buck spins and runs back into the woods kicking snow and disappearing in the brush
like hell you did
right behind the ear
youre full of shit
cobb said he got him then he got him
you have no vision stump
a writer without vision is a waste of my time
i think i picked the wrong man
cobb stumbles back into bed somewhat exhausted by the ordeal
and i think i better get back to san francisco before the storm hits
ill take care of these transactions mr
and jameson exits the room
and ill be leaving as well sir since you think im the wrong man for the job
shut up stump we both know that im your meal ticket
beat we need each other
smiles and we start in the morning
cobb reaches over and defiantly turns up the music so that the room is overwhelmed with kreislers violin
stump stares back at this decrepit overpowering figure
cobb gradually slips into sleep buried in the music the booze the pills the pain
the morning mist hangs thick over a snowbank in the woods
a rabbit scurries across the snow some quail are flushed
pan across the landscape reveals the lodge
smoke curls from the chimney
stump sits hunkered over a tiny portable typewriter on the kitchen table
cobb mixes a bourbon with orange juice to wash down some more pills which he takes randomly
a teletype machine sits on a table nearby throughout the scene a tape clicks endlessly out piling on the floor
cobb occasionally checks data on the tape
chapter one page one
know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day
stump types it out then stops
what the hell is that
thats what robert e
lee said at the burial of my grandfather who was a confederate general killed at fredricksburg
so im taking notes
thats the first line of my autobiography
i aint writing it
its a third person comment about someone whos already dead
an autobiography has to be in the first person plus it cant come from the other side of the god damn grave
my story can come from any damn place i want
not to mention you cant call yourself a prince and great man thats for the world to decide
what kind of a fucking writer you call yourself all tied up in rules and regulations
whats the point being a writer if you cant say what you want to
youre not treating me like a writer youre treating me like a stenographer
a shot rings out stump types quickly hunting and pecking with two fingers reading aloud
know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day
it has a certain ring to it
yes it does
i thought you might like it
its yours a gift from me
beat cobb a prince among men misunderstood in his genius as genius always is demands from stump this is the second line from what will be the greatest biography of
a great man ever written type it
cobb checks the tape and suddenly is deep in thought over some information coming across
bethlehem steels about to dive
cobb grabs a phone and dials then barks into the phone
on phone jameson
bethlehems going in the toilet
dump it all
cobb slams down the phone momentarily lost in finance
you got a stock tip for me
buy coca cola
were about to go out in cans
coke in cans
i dont think so
cobb just stares back in disdain
then suddenly cobb starts coughing terribly
he clutches his torso as if it were about to fall into pieces
you know whats wrong with ty cobb
proudly every disease known to man i got em all
and theyll never get me in a hospital never
beat my heart leaks the doctors who are nothin but a buncha hacksaw artists give me digoxin to keep it pumping
cobb grabs a bottle of digoxin pills and flings it across the room in a rage
he flings bottles of pills as he recites his ailments
they give me darvon for the cancer in my back they give me tace for something eatin up my stomach fleets compound for an infection in my bowels librium for
my tension insulin for my diabetes
cobb grabs a hypodermic needle and awkwardly pours from a bottle into the chamber
insulin spills as he does
he jams the needle wildly into his arm without hesitation
he takes a deep breath as if the drug has produced an immediate relief from pain
and if all that wasnt enough its been two years since i got my pecker in the air
beat the south may not rise again but my dick will
the phone rings
barks i aint here
stump answers the phone
answering the phone cobbs residence
beat hes not here whos calling
his face drops my god
to cobb its ernest hemingway
tell him to go to hell
stump covers the receiver nervously
jesus christ ty this is the great american writer this is the man who inspired me to become a writer
tell him to go to hell anyway
him and me used to be pals but we went on a hunting trip once and he hired a shitty guide
you didnt like a guide he hired
cobb looks at stump with a fierceness that is so over whelming so physical that stump melts
you tell him to go fuck himself or ill kick your yankee ass
stump is terrified
he reluctantly uncovers the receiver
to go to hell
awkwardly by the way im a big fan of yours click a hang up
cobb settles into a chair letting the drugs and pills and booze work their way into his thick body
hemingway isnt a bullfighter he wrote about bullfighting
what the hell is that
cobb rubs his head the drugs are taking effect
ty you okay
increasingly woozy stumpy listen to me you know what i need
what do you need
i need a woman
muttering to sleep a woman is definitely what i need
and cobb drifts to sleep in his chair momentarily overcome with painkillers
stump stares at the sleeping volcano of a man and when cobb starts snoring heavily he rises pulls on a coat scarf and hat and heads out the door
snow flurries greet stump as he heads outside and darkness is falling
he takes a deep breath
i couldnt be around the man for long without needing a break which his painkillers gracefully provided
beat my sanity would soon depend upon a frequent breath of fresh air a walk in the woods any escape from what one sportswriter had called cobbs brooding soul that
bubbled with violence
stump lights a pipe as he walks up a trail away from the lodge toward a ridge all covered with snow
the flurries of snow are getting thicker now
i knew most of the cobb stories first man elected to the hall of fame ahead of the incomparable babe ruth
statistics that havent been approached in three quarters of a century
stump stops at the ridge and looks down at the partially frozen lake tahoe in the lingering light
but id known boxing champions and football players they were gentle souls outside the arena
beat how much of cobb was an act a lifetime of theatrical intimidation to preserve his own legend
legends grow in time
tough guys are tougher women more beautiful routine acts of self preservation become heroic
stump continues walking down a crest of snow through a stand of snow covered pines
the light is dark purple eerie and stump is lost in thought until suddenly he sees a trail of blood in the snow
he follows it down a slope past a tree growing deeper thicker
and there it is the buck lies dead in the snow in a pool of blood
stump stops in fear then approaches leans down and examines my god
the bucks head has a hole blasted behind the ear
stump rises quickly to his feet and looks around
the woods are silent
snow falls from a branch
he hurries back through the woods up the ridge momen tarily lost as the snow swirls he finally spots the lodge
stump bursts into the lodge as the brewing storm blows in
cobb is standing there in a hunting jacket high laced boots a hat with a suitcase
he holds a paper bag wrapped in twine
were going to reno
i want a woman
theres a blizzard out there
when a man wants a woman a man wants a woman
lets just put on some soup build a fire and we can work on the book
holds up the paper bag i got thousand in cash and negotiable securities in here
dont let it out of your sight
look ty the roads are impassable
you lead ill follow
im not driving in this stuff
i need a woman
a blizzard two cars ease down an ice covered road in an increasingly horrendous snowstorm
stump is terrified straining to see through the flurries which grow thicker by the second
he keeps checking his rearview mirror
cobb at the wheel of a huge black chrysler imperial
he looks possessed
cobb at the wheel a madman
you call that driving alice
my sister can drive faster than that
step on it
he grabs a bottle of bourbon on the seat and chugs it down
a treacherous cliff drops quickly away from the road certain death protected by an inadequate guardrail
into a blizzard increasingly out of control the cars slip and slide and skid down the mountain
cobb leans on his horn honk honk honk
stump struggles to hang on as the car fishtails on the edge of losing control
he keeps glancing at cobb who continues screaming
get off the road ya cant drive any faster
stump is caught between fear and rage
i aint dying in this god damn ice cube
cobbs eyes flare the wind roars the blizzard beats against the windshield
muttering the man drives like an old woman
cobb steps on the gas his car pulls out into the oncoming lane and accelerates to pass
cobbs car passes stumps car down the steep grade
insane impossible suicidal not another car on the road the highway closed barely visible
and here comes cobb
stump stares in disbelief as he clings to the wheel
cobb waves his fist as he speeds past he laughs cackling madly at stump
drive motherfucker drive
the black chrysler rushes down the mountain into the raging storm
struggles to see through the windshield snow is swirling everywhere
cobbs car disappears into the blizzard fishtailing as it goes
stumps car creeps along the edge of a deep ravine that plunges to a raging icy river
the car fishtails straightens and continues on slowly groping down the mountain
it takes his full powers of concentration to keep the car on the road
to himself hes a goner al save your own god damn ass
he sees something
his car lights reveal tire tracks in the snowdrifts on the highway
the tracks skid wildly clearly out of control and head straight off the road
stump stops his car and gets out he hurries to the edge of the road where the bank drops away quickly
lies nose down at the bottom of a snow filled ravine thirty feet away
the tail lights are still on
the car is totalled
stump plows his way on foot down the embankment fighting bad footing and snowdrifts until he arrives at the car surely nobody could survive this
with difficulty he makes his way to the back door of the huge car and wrestles it open
stump sticks the top half of his body into the car
cobb lies upside down ass in the air his face buried under the dash of the car
theres blood on his face
its about fucking time you got here
cobb struggles to right himself twisting and turning free
i wouldnt call it living but itll do
help me outta here
stump helps cobb back out of the car
it is an awkward clumsy difficult task
of course theres blood
i just put my head through the windshield of a car what the hell ya think ya big fucking jerk
ty cobb cant die like this
theyll bury me and nobodyll know who it is
i said shut up
stump drags cobb awkwardly through the snowbank back up to the highway
when they get to the edge of the high way cobb stops to stare at the tire tracks leaving the road
no guard rail
im suing the state highway commission im suing the governor im suing every god damn body
outraged i coulda been killed
god damn it shut up and get in the car
the blizzard swirls around the two men now at stumps car on the highway
gimme your keys im driving
do you know how to get to reno
over my dead body
cobb pulls a gun from his overcoat pocket and aims it right at stumps head
you miserable son of a bitch
you coward you pathetic frightened desperate old man you cant do anything without that gun and frankly it doesnt impress me to keep flashing it because i know youre not
gonna shoot me cause you need me worse than i need you
what youre gonna kill me
he loves it when someone stands up to him
he thrives on confrontation
ive killed a man
fine then put me outta my fuckin misery
cobb hands the gun to stump
here ya go stumpy
i like a man who stands up to me
stump holds the gun awkwardly not knowing what to do
now give me the keys
the car races down the mountain a wild ride
cobb at the wheel is perfectly happy and at peace
stump in the passengers seat braces himself for certain death
its only another hour plenty of time to tell you my story before we find us some women
some for you some for me
well have a helluva time
the broadsre probably lining up right now waiting for ol ty and his buddy stump
muttering dear god
and cobb launches in as he accelerates down the mountain every curve risking death
he seems at peace with the world in the drivers seat literally on the edge of being utterly out of control
i suppose you want to know about my childhood
writers usually do
none of this know ye that a prince and great man has fallen stuff my philosophy is simply this life is too short to be diplomatic
a mans friends shouldnt mind what he does or says and those who are not his friends well to hell with em
and cobb drifts into a story of his youth
hes suddenly so relaxed that he pays little attention to the road
i was born in a small town in georgia of course
my sweet sister florence still lives there
beat and i started playing baseball when i was a kid like everybody else only i was better than every body else
when i was seventeen i started playing for money my father didnt approve
beat he was a great man
as the snow whirls around the car hurtling down the mountain the snowflakes fill the screen and turn to confetti as we confetti falls from the sky professor cobb tys
father waves to the crowd in front of city hall
signs everywhere declare him to be the newly elected mayor cobb
a band plays sweet georgia brown as the mayor makes a victory speech
he was the mayor they were grooming him for governor he was a learned man a professor and the head deacon in the baptist church
professor cobb sings loudly with the deacons behind the pastor as the congregation joins in
sings loudly there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuels veins
very young and pretty singing in the congregation
and young ty next to her also singing at the top of his voice
my mother was the most beautiful woman in the county
she married my father when she was twelve which was the way they used to do it
beat and she taught me to believe in the hymns we sang
i especially liked the bloody ones
singing the hymn and sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains
young ty cobb is baptized in the river
i remember after i was baptized and i was walking home with my pals
young ty and three buddies walk along the track
i was feeling very christian ready to live the good life my father didnt drink smoke gamble or chase women and i wasnt going to either the boys skip rocks
and start across a trestle bridge
when all of a sudden a train was coming at us
headed right for the boys
there i was a newly baptized child of god who hadnt hardly sinned and i was gonna die
the other other boys leap safely into the river well ahead of the oncoming train
but young ty stays on the tracks
the engine bore down on me till i could see the whites of the engineers eyes i was thrilled
he pulls the whistle and screams at the young boy standing defiantly on the track
his face filled with excitement as the space between him and the engine reduces to nothing
closer and closer the engine comes yards yards five four three
moments before death young ty cobb leaps to safety flying in front of the engine out over the water till he splashes mere milli seconds before he would have been
crushed to death
young cobb surfaces in the river and waves his arms in triumph
his pals shriek with delight and embrace him at his courage
it was the greatest thrill in my life not counting the first time i saw a woman naked
other trains on other tracks bearing down on young cobb
in each case young cobb dances in the track and leaps with grace to safety
i felt protected
by my father my mother the baptism i dont know but from that moment on i knew i couldnt be hurt
young cobb hurtles through the air toward the river just missing the locomotive
cobb and stump continue racing down the mountainside
my father died in a terrible accident you know
no i didnt really
didnt you do your research on me before you came up here
i didnt have time
i mean i knew the basics
then youve read that im the meanest bastard of them all
people have said that yes
i dont care what people think
then why do you care what i write
i am who i tell you i am
why are you making things so complicated
thats what writers do
well writers oughta make things simple
everythings complicated enough as it is
mutters maybe youre right
of course im right
stump suddenly looks up and shouts in terror
a snow covered truck in the middle of the road broken down and abandoned is on top of us
cobb spins the wheel the car spins out of control just missing the truck and hurtling on down the icy highway
dont shout like that stumpy it just increases my tension
i saw that truck all along you think im gonna hit a truck when im getting close to finding me some women
stump is in sheer terror by this time
my father was murdered yknow
your father was murdered
i mean thats the sort of thing youre looking for isnt it
beat murdered on the balcony of his own house
the house i grew up in
the head of a horse in f
shaking its head uncomfort able with the bit in its mouth
in the b
the gabled house in the moonlight
a small light spills from a second floor window onto the balcony
a man on the balcony porch moves toward the window from which light spills
the man pulls up the window and kablam
a shotgun blast rips the silence and darkness
the man falls on his back
a second shotgun blast takes off his head
stump is stunned by this information as the car careens wildly down the mountainside
your father was murdered
how come nobody knows about this
the oldtimers in royston know about it
nobody elses business
it happened when i was a few days before detroit called me up
but this helps explain why he catches himself
why im such a prick
laughs thats too easy youre a better writer than that was the killer ever caught
there was an arrest a trial and an acquittal
nobody was ever convicted
aw dont go sob sister on me stumpy
beat the only thing that finally matters is a mans accomplishments and i must say in all humility al in all humility i was the greatest ballplayer of all time
nobody is even a close second
detroit ball park detroit dugout day c a gambling den
money on the bench
two men is suits are placing bets intermingling with the players
a player smokes another drinks this is as far from the anti septic modern game as can be imagined
cobb early s selects his bat talks to the gambler
single to left steal second steal third steal home
eight to one
ten to one
cobb tosses some money on the pile and climbs up the dugout steps shouting
cobb swings the bat and shouts at the pitcher
hey greaseball check your wife one of the players is missing
the pitcher flips cobb the finger and takes a sign deliv ering a pitch which is swung on and missed strike three
cobb heads to the plate passing his dejected teammate who has just struck out
who the hell ever signed you
go to hell
cobb laughs he seems to feed on these exchanges and he stands in at the plate addressing the umpire
hey cyclops youre missing a good game
shut up cobb
as cobb digs in he reaches into his back pocket and drops something on home plate in front of the catcher
here ya go
the catcher holds up a pair of womens panties
your old lady left em in my car last night i thought you could give em back to her
he flips his thumb a sign for the pitcher to deck cobb
youre going down cobb
the pitcher delivers a fastball right at cobbs head he hits the dirt just before the pitch arrives and this is long before players wore protective headgear
cobb rises laughing defiantly
to the pitcher thats as hard as you can throw
shit it that was my fastball id wear a dress
then cobb shouts at the shortstop a large german american athlete the great honus wagner
id shade me a little up the middle if i was you
wagner doesnt budge comfortable in his position not drawn into cobbs taunts
stoic implacable far from cobb
to catcher you try to take my head off then you throw a sinker away in and out same old shit sinker away
his chatter stops his focus is intense and sudden
he holds the bat strangely with a split grip a left handed batter he dangles the bat almost parallel to the ground
for all his fierceness theres a delicacy in the way he holds the bat
a baton a paintbrush a magic wand
here comes the pitch sinker away and cobb unleashes a swing that is at once quick and powerful
he drives the ball to left the opposite way wagner lunges to his right but the ball skips into left
cobb streaks to first and rounds the base viciously daring to stretch it into a double but slamming on the brakes and returning to first when the throw rifles into
cobb shouts defiantly at the pitcher
you god damn coward
you shoulda thrown at me again
you shoulda hit me in the fucking head
cobb looks down at wagner who stands implacably at short stop a large powerfully built man
hey krauthead im coming down
he just nods
the pitcher stretches looks and delivers and cobb breaks for second
the pitch is wide
the catcher fires
wagner takes the throw as cobb arrives in a spikes up slide
and wagner swipes a brutal tag in cobbs face his giant ham of a hand in the tiny glove clutching the ball lashes across cobbs mouth
the ball pops free
wagner seems unbothered by the fact that cobb is safe at second he has bloodied cobbs face
cobb seems unboth ered by the fact that his face is a bloody mess he has stolen second
both men seem satisfied
more money is wagered
stretches and delivers cobb takes off for third
the throw is high he slides in safely
bets are doubled
the stands are full of wagering
the whole ballpark is like a giant saloon drinking smoking wagering and the game is played by thugs and brigands
yells at the pitcher and catcher
you want in on the action
my mother has a better arm than you
to the catcher im coming to you greaseball
coming to kick your dago ass
steals a glance at cobb who takes a menacing lead off third
the catcher gives a signal to the pitcher
nods winds up and as he does here comes cobb with a recklessness beyond reason
and as the pitch arrives in the catchers hands the catcher digs in to take on cobb cobb slides spikes high flying above the earth his back leg slashing his
spikes like knives
it is a slide of utter defiance and violence a slide intended to harm
a vicious collision between cobb and the catcher blood and dust
the ball rolls free
cobb and the catcher immediately start punching and in seconds a brawl breaks out both benches clearing
as the police rush out to break up the brawl
in those days you didnt hold hands and dance with the men on the other teams
they were the enemy you fought with em
beat and i was the most hated man in baseball
cobb enters the stadium through the dugout
the crowd rises to boo cobb
the boos are overpowering
cobb warms up in front of the dugout
the boos are deafening
the vindictive threats are ceaseless
youre a shit cobb
cobb continues warming up
i hate your guts cobb
cobb tips his hat and speaks easily to the fan
a good day to you too sir
the police escort cobb to right field the roar of the vitriolic crowd increases
do you know what its like to be booed like that
cobb in right with the cops the crowd on its feet booing so loudly that the air is all one giant wailing moan of hatred
it feels wonderful
they couldnt live without me
they came to the ballpark to see me
cobb opens a stack of mail a police chief and subor dinate officers are with him
cut out letters read cobb youre dead cobb puffs on a cigar defiantly as he reads his hate mail
fifty thousand fans trying to kill me everywhere i went
armed police patrol the stands looking for snipers as cobb plays the game in right field surrounded by police
the booing increases fans truly hate him
i loved it
only great men are booed
captains of industry and presidents
i knew em all
woodrow wilson and cobb have a drink
woodrow wilson had the best scotch
harding cobb and others play cards
a lot of money is on the table
and women that look suspi ciously like theyve been hired
a floozy drapes herself around president harding
warren harding had the best broads
a formal portrait with president calvin coolidge and cobb
coolidge doesnt smile doesnt seem to do any thing
just another portrait
and calvin coolidge wasnt any damn fun at all
during the portrait
we can read his lips as he mouths fuck you silently
like an out of control bobsled cobb races and stump hangs on for his life
after world war two general patton asked me for an autograph he said he patterned himself after me
beat are you getting this
why arent you writing
cause im trying to have a good grip on things when this car goes over the next cliff
i aint ready to die yet
cobbs tone changes suddenly he questions stump with out guile or anger as if his answer is obvious
but neither am i
cobb stares at stump waiting for an answer and forgets about the road
stump looks up in fear and points at the road
cobb swerves wildly back onto the road such as it exists in the blizzard
i said im not ready to die
then watch the fucking road
but youre not listening to me
i may have every god damn disease known to man but i am never going to check into a hospital because i am alive and i am going to get
laid in reno
beat youre gonna get laid too stumpy
maybe i dont wanta get laid
i thought you were divorced
were in the middle of a
talking my ass
quit hanging on get a divorce
is that why you dont wanta get laid in reno
cause youre feeling loyal to a woman youre divorcing
thats really stupid stumpy
im not getting a divorce
im being loyal
is that why you used to wine and dine that little brunette who had an office across the courtyard from you in santa barbara
stump is nailed
what do you know about her
i do my homework stumpy
i know where the bodies are buried
defensively it didnt last long
hey no need to defend yourself
when it comes to women im a total shit the difference is stumpy that i know im a shit
nobody knows about the brunette
our little secret huh
beat and that part about me being a shit with women
that aint gonna be in the book
i gotta put your family in my book
and nothing about my ex wives or children are gonna be in it
my book is about baseball
my book is about cobb
cobb is baseball
suddenly something appears ahead on the roadside
cobb doesnt see it
it looks like a figure huddled wrapped immobile in the swirling snow
it cant be
its a man
attempts to wave at the car
a nearly frozen desperate attempt to flag down the car
stop the car
cobb brakes the car spins to a stop some distance past the figure standing knee deep in snow
whoever it is hes gotta be pretty stupid to be out in this shit
were out in this shit
and stump climbs out of the car
stump trudges back to the half frozen figure who flails his arms stiffly at the apparition of a car in all this
the figure is wrapped in blankets his head covered
we cannot see who it is until we are in his face
please help me
are you okay
it is willie the black man who cobb fired the day before
i cant believe you found me
let me help you to the car
i told you that youd only last one day with the bastard
cobbs in the car
willie stops trudging toward the car
cobbs in the car
then im not getting in the car with that son of a bitch
id rather take my chances out here
and stump drags willie to the car though the man is re luctant the whole way he is in no condition to resist
muttering the whole way he hates me
he hates black people
he fucking hates everybody
dont give him the pleasure of dying out here
if dying out here gives him pleasure then i wont die out here
they get to the car stump opens the back door to help the nearly frozen man into the car
ty its willie
we can give him a lift to town
i aint givin no nigger a ride nowhere
and stump loses it he grabs cobbs pistol off the seat of the car and aims it right at cobbs head
shut the fuck up and give him a ride
now whos the coward
you wont shoot me
you need me
stump hands the gun to willie
but im sure willie would take great pleasure in it
willie climbs into the back seat with the gun
cobb is livid
youll pay for this stumpy
say willie you a baseball fan
whos the greatest ballplayer of all time in your opinion
willie mays no doubt about it
that nigger couldnt hold my jock
excuse me mr
cobb the man is speaking
and cobb jumps on the gas the car races off back down the mountain fishtailing as it goes
and id say the second greatest player of all time is jackie robinson
or maybe josh gibson
and of course the greatest base runner of all time isnt riding in this car the fastest baseball player of all time was cool papa bell cool papa wouldve easily
broke all your stolen base records
cool papa was so fast that when he entered a hotel room and flipped the light switch off hed be asleep in bed before it got dark
and then theres satchel paige
oh yeah satchel paige could throw a porkchop past a wolf mr
cobb ol satchel woulda had you eatin outta his hand he woulda had you hittin
and kissin his black ass to boot
shut this man up
the man with the gun does the talking you wretched old prick
racing down the highway in the snow and we go out hearing willie recount the greatest ballplayers of all time all of them black as cobb seethes a gun to
stump feeds willie watching cobbs racism simmer
into the storm the car disappears fishtailing down the mountain
the blizzard grows thicker the flurries taking over the mountain until all we see is the thick snow falling from the dark sky
as slick as a bobsled run
he lowers the gun and hangs on for dear life
he accelerates with vengeance
wobbles and starts spinning out of control then spinning continuous s down the grade
the world spins around them as they cling for their lives
until thud the car slams into a bank of snow
the three men sit without speaking for several beats slowly acknowledging that they have survived
finally fucked up roads
they dont build highways like they used to
glows a welcome sign in the night
it is no longer snowing
cobb thank you for a lift into town
willie hands the gun to stump and climbs out of the car bidding farewell to stump as he does
and you sir should leave this disgusting wretched sorry son of a bitch immediately
willie tips his hat and trudges to the neon glow in the distance
cobb and stump alone in the car
they both look out the car is buried hood deep in the bank of snow
under the famous arch that reads the biggest little city in the world a tow truck pulls stumps car into town and up to the truck stops stump helps cobb
out and into the old style building adjacent to the gaudier casinos
stump helps cobb to the registration desk in a clean but very modest old hotel
a woman s stands at the counter in the middle of some dispute with the clerk
she wears a long cheap plain cloth overcoat and galoshes
stump bursts in oblivious to the conversation in progress
two rooms please
the woman turns to confront the two men
now we see her
on a fabulous platinum blonde wig is stuck a yellow slicker type rain hat
the ear flaps are awry the platinum blonde wig curls up around it the effect is thrilling
stand back you old farts
im in the middle of something back to clerk the heats on the blink and the mattress is lumpy i want a discount
aw cmon you always want a discount mona
and the mattress is always lumpy cobb pulls out a bottle of pills and washes a handful down with a deep swig from a pint bottle of whiskey
the clerk looks on with alarm
excuse me ive gotta get him checked in
hes very sick
were all sick in the eyes of god but some of us still have manners
she whirls and leaves the lobby leaving the three men
two rooms next to each other
stump helps cobb shoot up with insulin the needle clumsily groping for a vein in the old mans arm
his face looks terrible drawn drained
cobb reaches into his pouch and pulls out a bundle of cash and security notes tied neatly with a string
barely audible my money
your moneys okay ty right here
your guns okay too
and stump hands cobb his beloved pistol which cobb takes with great affection and comfort
stump helps cobb into bed covering him with a blanket
the gun and the money sit on the pillow next to his head
cobb speaks with great pain just before he passes out from pain drugs and exhaustion
we havent missed the testimonial dinner have we
no we havent missed the dinner
cobb manages a small pained smile before drifting off into sleep
stump turns off the light and exits
stump pours a glass of vodka settles into a chair and dials the phone
he swallows deeply of the drink and waits
on phone hello
its your daddy
beat your birthday was yesterday
no it couldnt be
stump quickly checks a calendar on the wall and realizes hes missed his sons birthday
on phone omigod what can i say
i feel terrible no its not okay jeez
when i get off the road well do something special a late birthday eh
maybe you can go to spring training or something with me eh
beat listen is your mother there
beat i know she doesnt want to speak to me but i want to speak to her
waits for answer okay okay i feel terrible about the birthday
ill call you real soon
and tell your mother im not drinking anymore
stump hangs up the phone takes a deep breath and
he pours another drink and sits down to his typewriter
stump is hunkered over his typewriter pounding away
his voice over indicates what he is writing
i was a fool for thinking cobbs brilliance might be what i needed at this moment of my life
ty cobb was the last thing i needed
beat he was not misunderstood he was understood perfectly well
he hated blacks he hated jews he hated catholics he hated everything except himself and his own view of the world
beat at times it seemed like he would drop dead in front of me
beat and other times he seemed indestructible
beat i was reluctant to view the great ty cobb as a pathetic character lost in the past paranoia and the shallow defense of his own breeding
we hear sounds of the typewriter banging away as
we drift out the window leaving stump to write all night at first viewing through the window then moving until we have a view of we hear the incessant banging
of the typewriter gradually stump asleep full sun shines in the window
a bottle crashes against the headboard jarring stump to consciousness
he looks up to see cobb reading the pages in a rage
he tears them as he does
pathetic paranoid lost in the past
what is this shit
stump awakens slowly disoriented amidst a shattered bottle
those are my notes
you cant look at my notes
youre notes my life
youre gonna betray me you son of a bitch
you want the truth
im gonna tell the truth
mine for crissakes im the writer
but im the legend and legends are not pathetic
slightly defensive these are just notes
dont you understand anything about greatness
maybe you should find another writer
theres not enough time left
this frank admission momentarily stops stump
im entitled to my opinions now thats pathetic
who gives a good god damn about the opinions of al stump
what people want to know about is ty cobb
and they dont want to know who he hates cause everybody hates somebody
they dont wanta know if he had two wives or ten
they dont wanta know if he hit women or if they hit him
you think they wanta know how to steal second base
well i dont
oh oh oh
i get it
youre one of them college psychology type guys
you wanta find the missing piece to finish the puzzle known as the madman cobb you think youre the next hemingway but youre just a moderate success in a moderate
fuck you cobb
im much more than a moderate success
thats it now youre showing some life
you want psychology
ill give you some fucking psychology
cynically im all ears
my father was a great man
a horse shakes its head attached to a buggy
a man pats the horse and ties it to a tree
my father told my mother he was going out of town for the weekend on business
but he didnt go
he came back cause he thought she was being unfaithful
the woman preparing for bed
i dont know why he thought it cause my mother was a wonderful woman but he thought it
the father climbing up the trellis onto the balcony
my father thought he would catch the man who was trying to steal his wife from him
catch him in the act
pulls a gun as he nears the window
the woman hears noises on the balcony and leaps out of bed in terror
she turns and looks toward the bed
we dont see whatever shes looking at
it starts to open
my father had high standards
he believed in quality
he believed in education
he believed in god
he believed in me
he believed in my mother
but on that night he seemed like a prowler
and so a shotgun blast takes out cobbs fathers stomach and he reels back onto the balcony
he rolls to his elbows and looks up
my mother killed my father
shot him in the belly
beat and then blew his head clean off
a second shotgun blast takes his head off
cobb stands above stump who is still in bed
a pretty god damn good piece of psychology eh
that what youre looking for
the childhood incident that explans me
cobb spits on the papers of stumps text
well i was a prick before it happened and a bigger prick after it happened so stick that up your sigmund freud ass
stump is shaken by this story
your mother killed your father
and you aint printing it
i have to
not if i say so
i dont think you understand something i have final editorial approval of the book
no i do
i always have it
did you read your contract
its my standard contract
i just signed
i would never have agreed to this if you had final approval
cobb calmly picks up the phone and hands it to stump
call your agent
stump quickly dials and gets an answer
im in reno
things are fine
beat yeah listen
im just checking
did we give away final editorial approval on this cobb book
long beat of disbelief we did
cobb has it
stump listens long and hard his face sinks
cobb smiles and hangs the phone back up for stump who reaches for the bottle on the nightstand and pours himself a morning drink of vodka
well you were pretty stupid to give up approval werent ya
fuck you cobb
suddenly charming why you mad at me
your agent made the deal your lawyer your publisher you didnt even read the contract because you trusted them
who the hell ever trusted a lawyer or an agent
if i was al stump the guy id be pissed off at would be al stump
listen to me you son of a bitch if you die before the book is finished ill write the story i want
but i aint dying first
ill write slow
ill die slow
cobb lights a big cigar and sets fire to stumps pages
both men watch them go up in smoke
now get dressed so we can go find some women
stump just stares back exhausted and overmatched
the main room showtime
louis prima with keely smith are thrilling a packed house full of dinner tables
that old black magic has me in its spell that old black magic that you weave so well
cobb and stump at a table drinking and eating
a cigarette girl works the room at a nearby table
shes all legs and fishnet stockings
lookt that hundred bucks says i get in her pants before dawn
the cigarette girl turns and we recognize her
my god its mona
we met her at the hotel
ramona is a vision in this outfit as she approaches them
i dont remember
ramona arrives at their table
we stockpiled some havanas before senor castro did his little number
coupla monte cristos ramona number twos
have we met
at the hotel checking in
ohyeah you were the asshole
cobb is suddenly gallant gentlemanly even charming
excuse me young lady i must apologize for the behavior of my friend he has a crude side
ramona delivers the cigars and collects the money
stump is a bit chagrined and caught off guard by this cobb
it means moonlit garden of the gods
actually its german and means wise protectoress but thanks for the thought
louis prima takes the mike his number has finished to much applause from the drunken crowd
ladies and gentlemen thank you very much youre a great crowd i have been informed that we have a celebrity with us tonight who is a legend a man who
truly needs no introduction
beat so lets give a harrahs casino warm welcome to the greatest baseball player of all time the one and only ty cobb
the spotlight flies to cobb who kisses ramonas hand
stump has been left out of the exchange and mumbles
moonlit garden of the gods
the audience stands to applaud cobb full and genuine
cobb graciously waves to the crowd bowing basking
motions to his band
and this ones for the georgia peach
they break into sweet georgia brown
no gal made has got a shade on sweet georgia brown two left feet but oh so sweet is sweet georgia brown
cobb breaks into a little dance with ramona at the table much to stumps and ramonas amazement
for a moment at least there is great footwork and lightness in his movement we get a glimpse of the great athlete he once was
the great ty cobb
cmon up here
they want you ty of course they want me
and cobb heads for the stage walking better but not without effort a walk enhanced by drugs and booze
as he does ramona turns to stump
the greatest baseball player of all time
i dont know baseball from shmaseball but i know a nice man when i see one and i also know its time for my coffee break
and shes off with her trayful of tobacco to the cocktail lounge
as cobb arrives
singing fellas she cant get are fellas she aint met georgia made her georgia claimed her sweet georgia brown
louis prima welcomes cobb to the mike to thunderous applause
my great pleasure sir shaking hands ive always wanted to ask you something mr
cobb with all the great ballplayers playing right now how well do you think youd do against todays players
well i figure against todays pitchers id only hit about
thats amazing mr
cobb considering your lifetime average is nearly a hundred points higher
why do you think youd only hit against todays pitchers
because im fucking years old thats why god damn it
give me that thing
cobb grabs the mike and takes over
first of all i wanta thank you for that song sweet georgia brown
its a great song about my home state and i appreciate it
beat that song has become the theme song for the harlem globetrotters
as prima nods with a smile its too bad such a fine song had to be stole by a buncha niggers playing a faggot game in their underwear
prima and his cohorts are aghast
they cling to the hope that this is some put on some joke
they force a small unnatural laugh
stump winces and leaves the room heading for the bar
course the globetrotters are owned by a jew named saperstein so whadda you expect
prima tries gamely to seize the mike back
thank you very much
another round of applause for the georgia peach ty cobb
i got the mike dago gimme a god damn minute
nobodys got respect for their elders any more
cobb turns to the crowd which even in its drunken state is appalled and in disbelief
now let me explain to you how to hit a baseball
its a lost art
ever since that half nigger ruth started hitting home runs the skill the art and the science have been lost
cobb grabs a clarinet from a member of primas band
now say this is a bat
the casino managers and security forces are quickly gathering to figure out what to do
lets just haul him off thats ty cobb
hell fucking kill me
you see the bat is like a wand a magic wand
it should be caressed held like a woman
like a woman whos really in need of a man
the casino manager winces and consults
oh god here we go
hitting a baseball is really very easy
you cant force it
you cant overpower it
you go with the pitch
you let the bat do the work
its all rhythm and flow
and cobb starts demonstrating hitting techniques to the bewildered audience and casino staff
he strikes that familiar strange stance choked up on the bat a split grip the bat held parallel to the ground
stump sees ramona at the bar her cigarette cigar tray on the bar
shes smoking and working her way through a tall drink
he approaches her
you could learn some manners from your friend
ill try harder
motions for bartender youre a beautiful woman
its the wig
ramona pulls the wig off her head revealing a sea of bobby pins and hair pins tying her natural brown hair to her head
she sets the wig on the counter and scratches her natural scalp
the damn thing itches but its good for tips
give me a scratch will ya
stump scratches the back of her scalp somewhat embar rassed and somewhat aroused
turn you on
hey harvey another round
vodka and grapefruit juice
ramona slaps the wig back on her head
she doesnt care
harvey delivers another round
your wigs crooked
does it bother you
i was just
bored shrugging you wanta go to bed with me right
stump is so taken aback that he doesnt know how to answer
flustered he looks around then takes a deep hit on his drink
he is very unsure
you want money
im not a whore
i dont screw for money
i didnt know
i mean im not good at this
just divorced huh
its written all over ya
giant letters right across the forehead
d i v o r c e
plain as day
ramona lets out a loud hearty laugh without inhibition
its obvious huh
beat so if ya wanta pay me to screw i wont do it
then i wont
screw or pay
so ya dont wanta screw
no i do
all this ambiguity i see why shes divorcing ya
stump completely befuddled lets down completely
he doesnt care about getting laid or drunk or anything for the moment except having someone to talk to the some one is ramona
i dont know what im saying or doing anymore
im trying to speak my heart
i told my wife i wanted a divorce
she said okay then i realized maybe i dont
then go back to her
then quit crying
you want a divorce you dont want a divorce youre asking marital advice from a woman youre trying to get in the sack jeez louise
im not myself
stump is lost
he motions to the bartender
another round harvey
back to ramona this assignment has me befuddled
im supposed to tell the world that a monster is really a prince
im supposed to lie
you being paid
then its not a lie
its a job
quit agonizing take the money do what you gotta do and get it over with
for godsakes why not
stump has to think about this for a while
he knows greatness
im in the presence of greatness
i want to learn about greatness
she looks at him like hes crazy
greatness is overrated
maybe youre right maybe youre right
so what do you want
stump drinks deeply his heart needs alcoholic reinforcement
i want to be in someones arms tonight
why do men have such a hard time saying what they want
stump and ramona stagger in drunkenly they are awkward and passionate
she grabs his vodka and takes a swig from the bottle
dont drink too much
ya think i wont be able to screw if im too drunk
screwed stewed and tattooed
she laughs a hearty laugh letting it all out
i want to hold you
youre so thoughtful the others are trying to get me drunk and youre trying to keep me sober
youd be good husband material
not so fast i didnt mean come here
they embrace and hold each other fully doing nothing but holding on
im not a whore
i know i know
a moment of quiet simple bliss when the door bursts open the lock splinters with a crash and cobb bursts into the room full of rage
you two timing bastard
you god damn judas iscariot
you stealing my girl
ill kill you
shes not your girl
and cobb lashes out at stump stump tries to block the blow but cobb is relentless and cobb hits him again
stump falls backwards his head hits a corner of the table
whatre you doing
and cobb backhands ramona across the face knocking her down
stump lies on the floor only half conscious
he grabs his head
the room swirls in front of him as cobb grabs ramona pulling his everpresent gun from his pocket as he does
youre coming with me
i dont want to
cobb jams the pistol into her jaw
a dizzying view of cobb dragging the woman out of his room
and he passes out
cobb throws ramona to the floor and locks the door
her wig falls off
cobb picks it up and stares at it
put it back on
she does the wig sits at a funny angle
who are you again
i am the georgia peach
i have base hits in at bats stolen bases runs scored and batting records
beat and i want you to undress
cobb clicks the hammer of his gun with icy calm
that dont scare me cause if you kill me ill be dead and you aint gonna screw a dead lady
she stares at the madman
take your clothes off
ramona removes her top her breasts are jammed into a classic s push up bra
you got big tits
i like big tits
terrified they arent so big
theyre average actually but these bras are great
push em right up there
i owe a lot to the bras and wigs
a girl needs what she needs shut up
take it off
and covers her breasts with her hands
get on the bed
ramona gets on the bed cobb circles the bed continuously
youre a beauty
she rolls on her face propping herself on her elbows
terror and tears
cobb i shut up
his eyes are full of fury and lust
what i coulda done with you in my prime
im sure you shut up
what do you want from me
terrified she does
i want you to do exactly what i say
through the open door stump rises to his feet feels his head and groggily staggers out
blood on his hand
stump feels his way past a couple doors listening in unsure which room is cobbs until a booming voice ramona
stump hurries to cobbs door and listens in to be sure
cobb stands above her with his gun and his money
exactly what i say
cobb pulls a stack of bills from his bag
a thousand dollars
he holds out the money for her
do what you gotta do and get it over with mr
cobb takes a big sloppy hit from a bottle throwing in a few pills for good measure
i want you to tell everyone you meet that you fucked me and i was the best fuck you ever had
thats a lot
for a thousand bucks
he reaches out and straightens her wig which is pretty crooked by now
she lets him
then he falls apart vio lently grabbing his crotch
im looking at the most beautiful woman in the world do you hear me
cobb grabs his crotch with the violence he does everything
and im dead down here
and its been like that for over two years
now get outta here before i hit you
cobb lashes out at ramona a vicious right hand
she ducks as his fist slams through the headboard
georgia peach my ass georgia trash is what you are
ramona grabs her clothes and runs from the room past stump who has heard it all
he enters cobbs room
cobb sits at the foot of the bed thoroughly flustered
stump helps him into his bed where he curls up with his money and his gun barely conscious
she was a great piece of ass stumpy best i ever had
have we missed the testimonial dinner
no we havent ty
now get some sleep
stump tucks cobb in his bed as the old man drifts into sleep turns off the light and heads back to his own room
even in sleep dying he is twitching and full of fragments of unspent energy
he slept for days
i thought he was gone for sure
but even in sleep he was restless and in motion a fire always burning in his belly
stump at the typewriter pounding away without interruption
by this time i was working on two manuscripts one was his version my life in baseball which for better or worse was a history of how to steal second
base or how to hit the breaking ball to the opposite field
it contained nothing about his parents much less the death of his father at the hands of his mother
cobb tossing and turning in his sleep squeezing a pillow or blanket in a death grip
it contained nothing about his children and ex wives none of whom would even speak to him
beat it contained no insights from his friends because i couldnt find any
pages of the baseball book in progress next to a neatly stacked manuscript in progress
it was a baseball book and i kept it in the typewriter for him to discover and amend
beat it was a book i never planned to publish
stump sits on his bed smoking his pipe and writing in longhand on pieces of paper of all sizes
the second version my version was written on legal pads and hotel stationery and cocktail napkins and anything i could scrape together without drawing his attention
beat i kept my version in a box at the bottom of my suitcase
stump packs his version into a box hiding it deep in his suitcase
the whole thing had become an agonizing death watch and most days i couldnt believe the son of a bitch wouldnt die
the door flies open and cobb bursts in full of vim and vigor a fresh set of clothes on fire in his eyes
nothing like a cigarette girl and thirty hours of sleep to invigorate a man stumpy
you look like shit
been writing ty
cobb goes straight for the typewriter and yanks out a page grabbing the stack of typed pages as well
well lets see how were doing
cobb reads the pages with utter seriousness
yes god damn it stumpy yes
now youre getting it
none of this sigmund freud bullshit
baseball stumpy baseball
cobb rushes to stump and embraces him almost like a child
his eyes are wet with tears
people are no damn good but youre different
youre okay stumpy you get it
beat and i can trust you
stump stares back
now lets go roll us some dice alimony i feel a hot hand coming on
cobb and stump approach the gaming tables and as they do cobb is recognized and approached for autographs
he signs as he walks suddenly gracious in this moment
ysee how it works stumpy
they boo ya your whole career then when youre about to kiss off they put ya on a pedestal
thats what being a legends all about
arriving at a craps table cobb barges right in
send the dice to the peach boys and belly up to the bar
the croupier pushes the dice to cobb who places a bet as do the others
cobb rolls the dice but he sees something
stumpy what is that
are rolling dice at a nearby table
they appear friendly not intimate two among twelve
my girl went for the nigger
i think theyre just next to each other by accident
you with that nigger
cobbs voice silences the tables
ramona looks up
is she with you
ramona seizes the moment and kisses willie on the cheek draping herself all around him as if they were close
the intention is strictly to get back at cobb
this is my man mr
cobb and hes all man
my girl with my nigger
shes not your girl and hes not your cobb pulls his gun and tries to climb across the table
hes got a gun
cobb on the table with a gun as stump and police officers scramble to grab his gun hand
customers hit the deck
what is the world coming to
blam blam blam the gun is fired repeatedly into the ceiling fixtures into the mirrors above the tables
cobb is wrestled to the table by several men including stump
and it takes all of them to escort the struggling cobb out of the casino into the lobby
to security men were leaving were leaving
theres no reason to press charges
to everbody do you know who i am
youre a crazy old fool thats who you are
back off god damn it
where we going stumpy i wanta find us some more women
stump hesitates chaos swirls around them
cobb is out of control we hear threats of arrest when
ty ty ty calm down
its time for the testimonial dinner
this stops cobb cold
hes immediately sober
stumps car passes under the arch heading out of town and we go to voice over actually the testimonial dinner at the hall of fame was still weeks away but
it was the only thing that got him calmed down enough to get us out of town without getting thrown in jail or getting somebody killed
the car takes stump and cobb eastward
and as we headed across country cobb as usual was oblivious to the chaos hed left in his wake
in fact he was buoyed with new enthusiasm at the prospects of seeing his cronies once again
cobb is in an upbeat mood
hes reading a map
a tape recorder with hand mike sits between them
yknow something alimony i believe youre the best friend i ever had
swear on a bible stumpy i feel i can trust you now
deeply alarmed by this confession
i was disturbed to say the least that he felt we were friends but at least for the moment it made things bearable
beat and he started talking the world according to ty cobb
cobb talks into a tape recorder sitting on his lap enjoying the hand microphone
into recorder and then this fat ass named babe ruth came into the league and damn near destroyed the game of baseball
we all thought he was gonna eat and fuck his way outta the league but he hung around for a few years hung around
he was quickly revising next to you the greatest player of all time
he hit home runs
anybody can hit home runs
now excuse me i got work to do
sorry ty and cobb resumes into the tape recorder
i didnt care that they cheered and adored ruth i cared that they respected his ballplaying christ they built yankee stadium for him with a foot right field line
my sister florence could hit the ball feet
game in progress detroit vs
cobb at the plate a pitch at his head knocks him down
immediately both benches clear in a major brawl
whenever we got into a fight with the new yorkers of our guys would fight of their guys and me and ruth would take on each other
as the benches clear cobb races not at the pitcher but straight to right field where the babe is charging in like a rhino straight for cobb
somewhere near second base the two giants collide in a thunderous smash falling to the ground in a brawl as players slug it out in the b
the car races into the sunset cobb babbling on
during the day we worked on his version of the story
at night i worked on mine
alone in a room is writing on pads of paper
he pours another drink and lights a cigarette
i was drinking like a fish smoking cigarettes again and now lying about the hidden manuscript
beat and by writing two versions without telling him i was becoming something cobb was not
beat i was becoming a liar
rumble stump quickly hides the manuscript as cobb thunders in with the typewritten version the ver sion written for cobbs approval
fabulous stuff stumpy just brilliant
youre a genius
i love reading about me
cobb takes a swig of booze
some routine outside noise drifts in young people laughing and carrying on
goddamn it whos out there
cobb hurries outside drawing his pistol
cobb charges outside firing his pistol into the air
the manager and a security guard hurry over
followed quickly by stump whos now an expert at this
he shot up his share of motels for all the usual reasons guests were too noisy he couldnt get any sleep it didnt matter he was always boiling over
stump leads cobb back inside and calms the locals
and i became expert at keeping the peace wherever we went
as stump helps him shoot up
i also became expert at finding his veins
beat which always revived him
the car is parked by the side of the highway
cobb stands with the tape recorder next to an endless plain of flat desert or rolling farmland
the hood is up on the car steam spills from the radiator
and cobb is dictat ing like marc antony
into recorder by the age of i was a millionaire by the age of a multi millionaire by the age of
stump wades up in the weeds to give cobb his pills
stump driving as cobb babbles away into the tape recorder
somewhere along the way id gone from biographer to stenographer to chauffeur to nurse
i was the only thing keeping the bastard alive
and i kept hoping hed die
yknow stumpy with a friend like you i just might go on forever
cobb grabs the recorder mike and launches in again
back into the mike where were we ohyeah then at the age of i batted
which was an embarrassment to me but would be a career for anyone else
until by the grace of god we arrived days weeks months later i dont know in cooperstown new york for his beloved testimonial dinner
the ball field no game
nearby a set of buildings
the baseball hall of fame
stumps car pulls into town
a classic s motel
stump and cobb get dressed for the testimonial dinner
a black tie affair stump has to help cobb finish dressing
cobb is full of boyish enthusiasm
youre gonna meet great athletes great warriors great men at this hall of fame dinner stumpy
none of this modern pansy bullshit ive been looking forward to this for a long time you fucking liar
youve been hoping id die first

cobb peels some cash from his roll of dough and throws it at cochrane
the stores are closed
exploding how could you be so good behind the plate and so bad everywhere else
cobb grabs the phone and dials impatiently

who owns it

cobb thrusts the card into cochranes hand
god damn it mickey ya gotta give a better effort
and cochrane exits leaving cobb with stump once again
hes lost stumpy the poor mans been lost ever since he took a fastball in the ear
you take care of him

because it would embarrass him
cobb winces as he tries to rise almost falling

cobb poses in his tux proudly unsurely
you look like the greatest ballplayer of all time
you going to be okay
ill be okay when i hear the crowd
a crowd of locals has gathered and is cheering as the great old warriors of baseball get out of one limo after another and pass a phalanx of security guards
television cameras and photogaphers
announcer presents each one
the great left handed pitcher from the new york giants who struck out five men in a row in the all star game carl hubbell
lanky carl hubbell s waves to the crowd and cameras as he enters to applause from the locals gathered
the great third baseman from the chicago cubs harold joseph pie traynor

cobb gets out followed by stump
cobb walks into the building past the cameras utterly erect and upright stretching his full six feet one inch
the applause is the most enthusiastic yet
his concentration is intense his focus is mesmerizing full of pride and rage
he makes it to the door
your hand stumpy your hand
stump slips his hand to cobbs lower back just as they arrive at the door and the two men enter together
thank you my friend
and cobb is met by the hall of fame director charles who shakes his hand and shows him in
cobb good to see you again
and they head inside
an orchestra is playing georgia on my mind as cobb holds court at his table of honor
the great old players keep coming up to him renewing old acquaintances
the first is wahoo sam crawford s a contemporary and at one time both teammate and adversary of young cobb
sam crawford ty long time no see

the emcee raps a fork on a glass bringing the dinner to order
welcome to cooperstown ladies and gentlemen
were here to acknowledge the greatest ballplayers of all time those men still gracing our presence who were among the earliest inductees into the hall of fame
beat waner hubbell foxx cochrane hornsby traynor these are the giants the old masters of our craft
the spotlight moves around the room and each man waves half rising from his chair
but the greatest of all is with us tonight simply put the best ballplayer ever tyrus raymond cobb
a spotlight hits cobb who rises and waves to the crowd as the lights dim
we have gathered from the archives some film on mr
the lights dim a giant screen is lowered and the screen fills with old black and white footage of cobb in action
with the familiar voice of a narrator
this rare footage of ty cobb reflects his love of children and they admired him by the thousands
posing with kids in uniforms
he clowns with them tousling their hair knocking off their caps
on another occasion he partakes in a donkey baseball game showing his not so well known lighter side
on a donkey in a donkey baseball game
and heres cobb with two other immortals babe ruth and tris speaker
pose on the dugout steps
cobb and speaker were great friends off the field and of course were accused of fixing some games by pitcher dutch leonard
watching the film he cant believe what hes seeing and hearing
cobb and speaker carousing with obvious gambler types
note cobbs pov of the film is subjective and dif ferentiated from the film everyone else is seeing
we the audience see both versions
cobb and speaker were clearly involved with unsavory gamblers but finally were acquitted by judge landis though many questions remain unanswered leans over to stump with grave concern
what the hell is this
its a great film me and speaker and the fix
i think the medications getting to you ty im watching you run the bases
cobb on the basepaths rounding second and heading for third where he slides spikes high safe
staring at the screen
cobbs unique batting style led to an unprecedented batting championships and a lifetime average of
which places him far above the field
at bat demonstrating his unique stroke
his ruthless competitive spirit has sometimes been called psychopathic
turns to stump again
something is wrong
al what are you seeing
your batting stroke
climbs into the stands and starts attacking a heckler with his fists
in an infamous incident on august xx xx cobb attacked a heckler who turned out to have no arms or legs and was briefly suspended for the incident
stands up next to stump who pulls him back down
stumpy whats going on
ty i think youre not well ill take you back to the motel
whatre you seeing
you and connie mack
in his as uniform poses with connie mack
settles back down and says nothing the rest of the film though he continues to see different images
enamored of the old footage
cobb running and sliding with abandon and disregard a fabulous athlete
silently watching disturbed
he strikes his wife and she falls to the floor
he stands over her defiantly
cobb and his friends were notorious for booze and sex parties they had in the off season parties they called smokers which took place in various hunting cabins they would
fill with hookers
on a table gyrates to a room so thick with smoke that cobb and his cronies are barely visible sitting around the room a hooker on each lap bottles of
he rubs his eyes
what is this
as they watch the same film stump is watching
rounds third and slides home in a spray of dirt
freeze frame as the narrator wraps it up
and when he retired in cobb left behind batting records and a legacy of greatness that may never be approached
a standing ovation from the crowd as the lights come on
hes still disoriented by the film hes seen but the applause brings him back and the orchestra plays sweet georgia brown to cobbs raised arms
cobb and stump move through the hallway
crawford and foxx have something cooking in room over here ty
i never partied with these boys but they had a reputation
jimmy foxx opens the door a crack
you got some booze
beat whos in there
me sam and pie

cobb lights up
me and stumpy want some action
wanta meet some great broads
and jimmy foxx opens the door letting in cobb and stump
wahoo sam crawford pie traynor and jimmy foxx are sit ting quietly in the room with their wives each woman in her s
cobb and stump stand awkwardly
you know my wife lillian
and this is mrs
pearl meet ty cobb and al stump
meekly hello ladies
foxx pulls cobb aside and whispers discreetly
hornsbys got something on the third floor maybe more what youre looking for
cobb and stump hurry along looking for hornsbys room
loud music and laughter spills out of the room at the end of the hall
we see a woman enter the room
there it is
you sure youre up for this
ive never been readier
cobb takes a hit on his flask and they knock at the door
hornsby answers the door we can see a party behind him full of old players booze cigars and even some women though the whole thing is infinitely tamer than the
smokers cobb remembers
you aint comin in ty
an stumpy here
cobb starts pushing on the door
hornsby holds firm
youre a bastard and you aint coming to our party
whos in there

let me talk to mickey
hornsby signals to cochrane who comes over to the door
ya look good in that tux mick
i cant let ya in ty
its rogers party
im an invited guest
god damn it let me in
cobb tries to break into the party but hornsby rushes over and shoves the door in his face leaving ty and stump alone
presidents of the united states of america used to invite me to the white house to drink their scotch and smoke their cigars and fuck their women
lets go to the motel ty
cobb heads down the hallway pounding on every door hes ready to explode
let me in god damn it
i invented this game
let me in
lets go home ty this isnt a good place to be
screaming i fought for players rights and salary increases and unions while all you crawled around on your knees begging massa for bread crumbs just thankful for a job
open up god damn it
ballplayers can make big money but theyre too stupid
youre all too stupid
the hell with ya
cobb grabs stump and pulls his face close
take me back to the hall
charles the hall director opens the door for cobb and stump
he clearly has been summoned in the middle of the night
i appreciate your coming
cobb no problem
cobb is silent
he and stump enter
the director flips on a couple lights the hall is partially lit
charles stays in the b
as cobb leads stump past all the displays various shrines and photos and old bats and balls and records until a glass case full of cobbs things his original detroit
tiger uniform hangs there
three of his famous black betsy bats his glove a couple balls and his spikes
cobb stands in front of the case just staring
stump stands respectfully a few paces away
cobb stares at his old uniform
stump stares at cobb
and cobb starts crying softly at first then swelling until the muffled deep convulsive sounds become more audible
he starts crying like a baby
stump stands quietly nearby afraid to move until finally
cobb sucks up the tears and finally turns to stump
what did you see on that film tonight
i saw ty cobb playing baseball
i was raised in the baptist church but i know that heaven is just the ol oskefagus the change up
you swing from your ass cause you think life is a fastball down the middle and after your bat has crossed the plate and youre all off balance and looking
stupid the ball just kinda flutters across home slow and juicy and hittable and as it crosses the plate the ball looks at you and smiles a nasty smile and laughs its way into the catchers mitt
beat we dont just lose were made fools of
you were the best
save the romance for the book
beat and take me home to georgia
a black limo crosses the landscape
cobb reads the typed manuscript next to stump who just stares out the window at the passing landscape
cobb parted with some of his hard earned money and rented a limo in order to make what he called a grand re entrance to his beloved home town of
cobb marks the margin of the manuscript
he loved the manuscript as well he should it made him out to be a saint cobb looks up from the manuscript
greatest biography ever written the book like cobb was almost finished
but he was dying slower than i was writing and like everything else he viewed it as a competition that he was not going to lose
sweating pale hanging on
a grim smile
to me we werent riding to georgia in a limo
beat we were riding in a hearse
heads into the deep south past catfish restaurants shanties and civil war battlegrounds
it looks like a hearse
welcome to georgia the peach state the hearse rushes into georgia
staring out the window as the georgia landscape passes
paint chipped and faded
and the fuckin sign needs paint
the sign reads welcome to royston georgia a large painting of cobb rounding third is still visible though barely as part of the sign
the limo passes
the limo moves slowly and ominously through the town
old folks black and white sitting on chairs and benches in front of the stores under awnings stare at the strange sight of a limo cruising slowly
it wasnt exactly the grand re entrance to a home town that he talked about
sitting under an awning
they point and discuss among themselves who this could be
cobb motions to the driver and to stump
my sister lives down this way
turn right here
slightly confused they look kinda the same
whens the last time you saw her
about fifteen years ago
but she understands me
the limo cruises slowly through a quiet neighborhood
maybe she moved
like the others
ill see if its her
stump gets out of the car and heads up the walk
stump knocks at the door the door opens a woman in her s appears
it is florence cobb xxxxx
good day maam
im looking for florence cobb
i have your brother in the car
and hed like to see you
he cant quite see who it is from his angle
i dont wish to see him
its been a long time he said
hes not well
i have nothing to say to him and wish to hear nothing he has to say to me
i know theres been problems but the family is very important to him
young man the family he talks about never existed
he loved his father
if his father if my father was such a great man why did tyrus turn out to be so evil
he doesnt have a ready answer
he just wants to see you
and she politely closes the door in stumps face
stump turns sees that the limo is at such a distance that cobb couldnt possibly have seen or heard her
he returns to the limo
stump climbs back in next to cobb
he motions to the driver to head off the limo does
it wasnt your sister
the woman in the house said your sister moved a long time ago
she doesnt know where
you cocksucking liar
my sister doesnt want to see me and youre lying
and stump at last goes off liar
a cocksucking liar
of course im a liar
thats what im paid to do isnt it
lie about ty cobb
if you didnt like the job why didnt you quit
who would take care of you
dont give me the sob sister routine
i listen to your bullshit i interpret and shape and find words for your bullshit and you give me nothing but grief
you love being this close to greatness
stop the car
the car stops
stump climbs out searching for room and for air to breathe
the skies are overcast and dark
stump walks away from the car and from cobb
some wind blows and the threat of rain
i wish youd die
i will stumpy i will
cobb is out of the car on his cane following stump
and go to hell
a line of lightning signals a storm in the distance
oh ill do that too
beat and look how convenient youve made it
they look up the entrance to the royston cemetery
a casually maintained slope of several acres up a hill
that was your sister alright and she didnt want anything to do with you either
i forgive her
stump walks into the cemetery to escape cobb who follows nonetheless with a cool resolution
stump laughs at cobbs comment
you forgive her
following along forgiveness is crucial to human maturity and religious growth
we all need to forgive more al
you oughta try it
youre too angry
youre all pent up
through the cemetery they keep walking up a long hill full of tombstones and shrines and sprays of dead and dying flowers and gaudy plastic bouquets
cobb following steadily along with his cane several paces behind stump
thunder shakes the ground
and more lightning
are you angry because i discovered you were a whore
is that it alimony
is it the divorce
you gotta let go of it
i love her
i dont want a divorce
sure ya do
youre just so used to accommodating people that you dont know what you want anymore
i accommodate nobody
stump whirls near the top of the hill to face cobb who continues making his way along slowly and surely
but you have no friends
who are they
those drunken hacks you hang out with who all think theyre gonna write the great american novel but all theyre gonna ever do is bitch and moan and write lousy
leads about high school football games
how about the brunette in the courtyard
is she your friend
i heard she fucks everybody she must be everybodys friend
a mausoleum looms behind stump bigger than anything in the cemetery classical outsized monumental even elegant
one simple word is above the door carved in granite cobb
im glad were here i was gonna bring you here anyway sooner or later stump turns to see the mausoleum and the word cobb
which cobb of georgia is that
several beats as the men take it all in
finally with pride that is me
and rain suddenly falls from the skies threatening to soak the two men
cobb heads for the mausoleum stump follows
just enough room for the two men to stand
on either side of them are two crypts enough for four burial vaults
cobb is very calm now and lucid
rain falls heavily outside
when i die my mother and father will be moved in here and in time my dear sister florence will join us as well
beat the family will be together again
stump is still fuming angry and cynical
under one roof
you want that in the book
ty cobb brings the family together at last to enter the gates of heaven whole
you mock my family you mock me
cobb grabs stump by the throat and stares him in the eye
my father was a great man
then why are you such a bastard
being a bastard is a small price to pay for greatness
i too am a great man
let me go
my mother didnt kill my father
whatre you talking about
cobbs fist clinches stumps throat forcing him to hear
outside the mausoleum rain pours down now a southern spring thunderstorm unleashing torrents
my father told my mother he was leaving town for the weekend but he came back to the edge of the woods where he tied up his horse
a horse shakes its head attached to a buggy
a man starts through the thinning woods
because my father thought my mother was being unfaithful to him
in the window a silhouette of the woman
a dress drops
the man climbs over the railing and peers in the window
he pulls a pistol from his belt
he was going to catch my mother with another man
young thin beautiful
she turns and looks towards a bed we cannot see
the woman whirls she hears a noise
she ducks down
she reaches under the bed and pulls out a shotgun
she lifts the shotgun up awkwardly and without familiarity
i stood by my mother when she was tried for murder a few months later
i said she was noble and true and loved my father completely and the whole thing was an accident and she was acquitted as she should have been
his mother looks away at something
because my mother did not kill my father
his mother hands the shotgun to a naked man climbing from bed
my mothers lover killed my father
cobbs father raises the winow kablam
the lover fires into his stomach
cobbs father lurches onto his back
on his back staring up at his mothers lover
the last thing my father saw was the face of the man fucking his wife
the lover unloads the second shell blowing his head off
the rain pours down on the cemetery
cobb still holds stump by the throat
is that what you want
cause thats all i know and the only other people who know about it are dead
but it aint going in the book either cause youre the only friend i got left and youre the only man i can trust
cobb lets stump go relaxing his grip and stump rages back outside into the rain
cobb stays dry in the doorway of the mausoleum
i dont want to be your friend
i dont want to feel sorry for you
so your mothers lover blew your fathers head off
i dont care
you were a prick before it happened you were a prick after it happened youve been a prick ever since and youre a prick now
cobb quietly takes a hit on his flask from the doorway of the mausoleum watching stump rant and rave in the rain
public relations are overrated
what the hellre you talking about
cobb holds out his flask for stump
you need a drink
fuck the drink
cobb motions for the limo to pull up the slope towards them
youre too angry al you just gotta learn to let it out
stump stands in the rain screaming at cobb who stands out of the rain calm centered drinking dying
im gonna tell the truth about you cobb
im gonna tell the world you hate women jews and niggers
calmly you shouldnt use the word nigger stumpy its racist and demeaning
and i dont hate women im just not very good with em which puts me in the same boat with you and every other man i know
you treat people like dirt
cobb comes out into the rain toward stump
the children of america need heroes al you know that
cobb takes him by the arm and tries to lead him to the limo
get your hands off me
taking by the arm youre making a fool of yourself out here
its not dignified
helpfully come in out of the rain
and cobb helps stump into the limo which pulls out of the cemetery still being drenched by rain
the rain is thick yet another motel another neon sign and the limo parked in front of one of the cabins
both men are sitting in rocking chairs in front of a fireplace
stump is in a bathrobe his feet in a big pan of warm water a bottle of booze in his hand
he looks a mess
cobb is idly playing with his pistol
hes calm introspective
youre an educated man
tell me what you think
stump just sits there drinking
either my father was
inadequate for my mother
he was not the man i thought he was
not a great man
not even a good man
beat or my mother was
a common whore
beat its that simple isnt it
stump just shrugs and takes another hit
as a boy i stood in court next to her because suddenly i was the man of the house but as i stood there steadfastly by her side and heard
the jury say not guilty i knew shed been with another man the night of the killing
stump drinks deeply once again
a man must defend his mother at all times isnt that right al
or am i a fool
a man must defend his mother at all times
thats what i thought
and the two men sit there silently rocking slightly trying to stay warm when there is suddenly a knock at the door they stare at each other
cobb puts down the gun struggles to the door and answers it
a man stands in the rain carrying a briefcase trying vainly to keep dry
cobb lets the man inside points to stump in the chair
stump nods as he swigs on the bottle
ive been chasing you all over the country opens his briefcase im here to serve you papers
im afraid its divorce stumpy
i know this routine
youre being sued for divorce
but my wife and i are still talking
yeah and what shes saying is fuck you
well fuck her
no fuck him
stump reaches for the gun and aims it at the man
you aint serving me no papers
the man is frozen with terror as stump rises from the chair drunk and crazed aiming the shaky gun
im just doing a job
i love my wife
we all loved our wives al thats got nothing to do with it
youll find somebody else
theres a million broads out there stumpy put down the gun
stump fires at the man but the shot goes wild
hes drunk hes not experienced with guns hes shaking
i am not going to accommodate this man tyrus
youre all mixed up
give me the gun
youre absolutely right tyrus ive been accommodating people my whole life and it stops right here
beat youve killed a man
ill kill a man
he misses again
the man drops to his knees begging for his life
please dear god
i have a family too
dont give me that sob sister stuff
stump tries to hold the gun with two hands approaching the man to nearly point blank range
stump looks crazed a bathrobe falling open his feet bare and wet his hair awry from the rainstorm
he aims the gun at the mans head looks at cobb with wild glee
life is too short to be diplomatic
a mans friends dont care what he says or does
youre my friend ty right
youre my friend
stump pulls the trigger click
as the man looks up realizing hes alive stump strikes him across the face with the gun drawing blood
the man scrambles to his feet and races from the room grabbing his briefcase and running to the door
no wonder she wants to divorce you
and the man runs into the rainy night leaving cobb and stump
stumps head collapses in his hands bewildered exhausted
the two men sit alone for several beats before stump speaks
he is completely lost
i almost killed a man
a little drunken excess
i put a gun to a mans head and pulled the trigger
i wanted to kill him
its forgotten already
i saw nothing
yes it did
al listen to me
if i was hired to write a biography of the greatest sportswriter of our time a biography of al stump would i include what happened tonight
attorneys are pigs divorce attorneys are lower than pigs
what happened tonight was private
your own business
our own business
it wouldnt belong in a book about greatness
nobodys gonna write my biography
and when the brunette in the courtyard brushed against you i know what happened al
a warm summer breeze the smell of jasmine her black hair against a white blouse you came to life again you got hard and when you saw her naked it
was more than you could bear
its okay al its okay
beat the brunette aint gonna be in the book either
stump looks up at cobb but says nothing
he picks up a nearly empty bottle off the floor and takes a hit
and the drinking
well they used to say ol ty had a drinking problem but you can booze me right under the table right now
and nobodys god damn business either
stump raises his hand motioning cobb to stop
i get it
i get it
then get some sleep
you look pathetic
stump crawls on the bed toward the pillows with the stupid grace of a drunk looking for a key under the mat
cobb helps stump lie down pulling a blanket over him
stump rolls over to go to sleep cobb tucks the blanket around him and picks up the bottle from the pillow
cobb takes a last hit of the bottle finishing it off
he throws it to the ground and looks around the room for another
lies open on a chair
a nearly full bottle of scotch is visible
he makes it to the bottle steadies himself hes ex hausted
he takes a deep swig from the scotch
several deep gulps enough to kill a horse but it only helps him steady himself
and he sees something in the suitcase he looks down at which stump has been filling with his secret manuscript
cobb opens the box and pulls out a paper
he reads it
he looks at stump and cobb takes the box and the bottle to the chair by the fireplace where he sits down puts on his reading glasses and starts reading
the real story
he reads page one slowly and carefully then starts mov ing through the box full of odd sizes of paper hotel stationery cocktail napkins legal pads all handwritten in secret
he keeps glancing up at the bed where stump is in the deep stupor of sleep
reading to himself vicious pathological bubbling with violence
cobbs demons were not merely exorcized on the baseball field
they spilled over into all parts of his miserable life
from the text from cobbs real life
a cobb sharpens his spikes with a file
b cobb steals second base and slides spikes high drawing blood
c cobb driving a fancy car with a pretty woman at his side
d cobb beats a man to death in an alley
e cobb onstage with a stripper at a smoker
f cobb striking his wife and knocking her to the ground
g cobb firing a gun at stump in the hunting lodge
h cobb and stump being turned away from the parties by hornsby
i cobbs father being blown away by the shotgun
j cobb on third being booed more trash on the field
police restrain the crowd
cobb stands defiantly waving the crowd away in a menacing gesture fearlessly
the sounds of derisive booing build to a crescendo and then
cobbs eyes flare hes in a rage
he rises from the chair his adrenaline has momentarily overwhelmed his system and he moves as a young man
cobb picks up the pistol and reloads it
cobb marches resolutely to the bed
cobb aims the loaded gun at stumps sleeping head
oblivious in a drunken sleep
rage is in his eyes
he cocks the gun
he shakes his head
you dont have a point of view stumpy you aint worth killing
cobb puts the gun into his own mouth he clears his throat as if to make room for the gun barrel
he gags slightly and closes his eyes he thinks for the last time
somethings not right
cobb removes the gun momentarily and looks at it
he sees that the gun barrel is covered with blood
rushes into the bathroom and faces the mirror
blood gushes from his mouth as he coughs again
as he stares into the mirror
this cant be
this is not right
cobb coughs again more blood covers his chin
he touches his chin touches the blood smears it around a little looks at his hands now covered with blood
cobb moves around the tiny bathroom like a caged animal
he falls to his knees in prayer in front of the sink
our father which art in heaven hallowed by thy name
thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive beat aw fuck it
little late for that sob sister stuff
cobb rises to his feet and looks in the mirror again
he grabs a hand towel and daubs his face with it
a bit more blood trickles from his mouth
and gradually a deep calm seems to settle over him
so this is what it feels like
returns to the bedroom and sits down on the edge of the bed next to stump who continues his deep drunken sleep
cobb picks up the phone and dials as he continues mopping his chin with the towel
he speaks with great calm
on phone can you get me the emory hospital
couple beats hello maam
this is ty cobb
can you please prepare your finest room for me
tomorrow morning would be fine
cobb hangs up and leans back on the bed next to stump who is still deep in drunken sleep
one man sleeps deeply the other just sits there
the limousine pulls away from the motel
the rain has stopped
stump rolls over the hangover is brutal
he looks worse than weve ever seen him
he reaches for the bottle
off no answer tyrus
off no answer peach
stump struggles to his elbow to find cobb
is empty and still neatly made
stump sits up with a start
he is suddenly by circum stance awake and alert though he looks like hell
hes also alarmed something is wrong
stump leaps out of bed and looks around
three holes of broken plaster and mirror
he rushes to the fireplace where only embers now glow
he sees something the real manuscript scattered around the floor near the chair
nearby the bathroom door is open
stump hurries into the bathroom and stops cold
blood is on the sink and on the towels
a note is on the mirror
he pulls the note down and reads it
dear alimony you lying s
im checking myself into the hospital
i think the end is near
your pal ty
a cab pulls up stump gets out
hes cleaned up now shaved dressed neatly
stump goes up to a reception desk and introduces himself
im here to see
a crashing noise and shouting erupt from down the hall
a tray of food is thrown out into the hall
get the hell outta here
you call this a hospital
you call this food
you know who i am
hes got a gun and we havent been able to get it away from him
i know i know
stump hurries down the hall to the source of the noise
a small group of doctors orderlies and nurses are gathered outside cobbs door afraid to enter
also there are two civilians in business suits
he doesnt want visitors
stump ignores the advice and enters the room
cobb sits in bed his gun and his money are next to him
hes giving orders ranting and raving in a classic cobb rage
a bottle hangs from a pole feeding his arm
a doctor and two nurses are present trying to deal with him
hey stumpy where you been
you cant believe the shit they call food in this joint
you get some sleep
i had quite a read last night
a nurse enters warily but determined with a small sy ringe
excuse me sir but i need to draw some more blood
put a bucket under my chin and ill cough up a couple pints for ya
i have to do it this way
well dont poke around too long
he holds out his arm for her
she begins drawing blood
shes a nice piece of ass eh stumpy
to nurse you come back later and climb on the big fella
its against regulations sir
so you read the book
yeah god damn it i thought i could trust you i used to be able to figure out people better
that book is the truth
youre a god damn romantic

just like you and just like my mother
another nurse enters and announces
barton is here to see you
he says hes the chairman of the board of coca cola
tell the son of a bitch to go downstairs and have a pepsi i got no time for business
nurse tapes cobbs arm and escapes with the blood sample
a young doctor enters also warily
i need to take your blood pressure sir
what else you need to know
i have to do it
the young doctor wraps cobbs arm with the device and begins pumping
another older doctor enters and addresses cobb head on
we cannot allow you to have a gun in here
cobb picks up the gun and aims it at the doctor
come and get it
the older doctor turns and leaves
stump enjoys the show
yknow stumpy my oldest son was a doctor a hacksaw artist thats all they are increasing rage he died of a brain tumor when he was forty hadnt spoke to

the younger doctor completes his task and slips away
to the younger doctor bad aint it
i dont know which version of your life im going to publish
i really dont
there ya go again
accommodating me and you dont have to
i died faster than you could write
cobb waves his gun just as some more doctors enter
get the hell outta here
everybody but stumpy
the room clears leaving only cobb and stump
you fooled me stumpy nobody ever fooled me but you pulled it off
i thought we were pals
i didnt know what i was getting into with this job

tell the world that the greatest ballplayer who ever lived was also the biggest bastard

stump nods and pulls a pint of whiskey from his coat pocket
he goes up to cobb and tucks the whiskey under the blanket
heres a little something might help
cobb nods in appreciation
wheres my money
right here peach
next to your gun
cobb grabs stumps hand for one last word
stumpy theres nothing wrong with wanting glory
beat now get the hell outta here
stump places cobbs hand on his money nods and stump leaves the room without looking back at with a gun in the last stages of life his health in total
collapse he is in complete control
doctors nurses orderlies men in suits all are waiting nervously outside the door as stump emerges
what about the gun
did you get it
naw i didnt get the gun
and stump leaves the hospital passing the coke executive
as he does he looks back over his shoulder to see rushing back into cobbs room
and the sounds of crashing broken glass and cobbs thunderous voice
stump smiles slightly and walks away
a teenage boy re paints the faded sign that reads home of ty cobb
the luster returns to the old sign
i gave a few bucks to a local kid to re paint the sign and disappeared for a while to finish the manuscripts
beat and wait for cobb to die
beat and while i waited ernest hemingway blew his brains out getty bought honolulu oil company and the brunette in the courtyard ran away with a handsome young lawyer
as cobbs image rounding third reappears in all its former glory
and on july
ty cobb died quietly in his sleep
i dont believe it was quiet nothing he did was quiet but thats what the newspaper writer said who wrote the lead and we all know that writers never lie
pan over across the sign to the adjacent cemetery as a hearse enters the cemetery grounds followed by three cars
a very humble ceremony
and the voice of a country gospel singer can be heard
there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuels veins
the mausoleum the coffin sits by the open crypt
somebody hired a singer
and sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains
but it was the grimmest damn funeral service id ever seen
stump stands in the distance at the back of the cemetery watching the simple empty service
he left all his money to his family though no members of it managed to attend the funeral and with the rest he founded a hospital in his own name
and an educational trust fund for poor georgia children
in dark suits drop flowers on the coffin
only three ballplayers attended the service three oldtimers who hed been supporting financially for many years a fact he didnt want made public
pulls in and unloads dozens of little leaguers in uniform join in the service
somebody rounded up some little leaguers probably so the press photographers would have some sob sister photos
the sort cobb hated
except the press didnt bother coming
beat ill give him this the family was under one roof again
stump turns and slips quietly out of the cemetery
i called my publisher
the book was ready
only i didnt know which one to turn in
the regulars are still there still drinking still griping
so a woman goes into a bar with a duck under her arm sits down next to a drunk who looks up and says whered you find that pig
an the woman says thats no pig thats a duck
an the drunk says i know i was talking to the duck
bored laughter and another hit on their everpresent drinks
and stump enters for the first time in nearly a year
stump enters comfortably happy to see his cronies at last
frank and the others come over from the bar quickly gathering around stump
another round on me
stump settles in at the table
long time no see etc
good to see you guys
hows it goin
alan hows that novel coming
must be about done by now
uh actually i havent started it yet
been kinda busy
we all been busy
yeah i know how it is
we read that cobb died
finally gave up the ghost
what was he like
were the stories true or were they exaggerated
the drinks arrive
stump plays with his swirling the drink around the ice with his finger considering his answer
tell us the truth man was he a monster
or was he just one of the guys
stump looks at the faces of his buddies eagerly awaiting his judgement as if it is final wisdom
he stirs his drink
ohyeah the absolute truth no bullshit give it to us straight etc
stump takes a drink and looks his friends in the eye
a prince and a great man has fallen
murmurs of deep satisfaction from the cronies
yes awright we knew it
helluva guy eh
a helluva guy a great man a misunderstood artist a fierce competitor but a sweet man at heart
a gentle soul
as stump starts lying to his enraptured audience we pull back and up going from the intimate center of the table to a cool distance and
some kids play baseball with a taped up ball patched up bat no uniforms rocks for bases
the right way
i published the lie and put the truth in a closet
pan over to the royston cemetery in b
nearby two holes in the earth have been opened up and the caskets of cobbs mother and father are being moved into the mausoleum
cobb and his father and mother were together at last
beat the man had some deep unexpressed sorrow that i could never know
i embraced him and i hated him
beat and i knew i would never write a novel unless you considered cobb a work of fiction which i did not
stump walks from the dugout to the field
he stares up at the magnificent old structure the overhanging right field facade the great upper deck almost a century of baseball has been played there
my friends were thrilled to hear that the georgia peach was a helluva guy it excused their own failures if cobb was okay then by god they were okay
beat but finally i didnt lie for them or the children of america or somesuch hogwash finally i lied for myself
beat i needed cobb to be somebody he was not
i needed him to be a hero
it is my weakness
stump turns to walk off the field
the book was a moderate success
the empty stadium cavernous half cathedral half factory
fritz kreislers violin music that cobb adored drifts up
his demon fury gives way to the fierce joy of his play ing
he slashes a ball up the alley turns first and never hesitates at second and as the relay comes into third cobb slides with spikes high and a cloud of
