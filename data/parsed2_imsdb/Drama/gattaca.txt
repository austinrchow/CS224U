gattaca early draft by andrew m niccol a screen play by andrew m
niccol a white title appears on a black screen
as night fall does not come at once neither does oppression
it is in such twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become victims of the darkness
justice william o
douglas the title fades off replaced by a second title
i not only think that we will tamper with mother nature i think mother wants us to
william gaylin the second title fades off leaving a dark screen
the darkness gradually gives way to a dawning light
we are confronted with sight of a barren empty landscape
a wide expanse of wasteland
suddenly without warning an elephant tusk falls from the sky and crashes onto the parched ground
the earth shuddering impact causes the tusk to rebound once in slow motion before finally settling to the desert floor in a cloud of dust
the first tusk is quickly followed by a second also dropping from the heavens
it lands near the first
another tusk smashes to earth several yards away
yet another comes crashing into the foreground
finally the dust settles upon a graveyard of tusks
in another region of the wasteland a forest of tree trunks suddenly rains down from the sky
the trunks thump to the hard ground also rebounding in slow motion
cleanly sawn branchless palm like trunks they come to rest in the dust only to be followed by a second cascade of lumber
when the dust finally clears
the felled tree trunks lie in a huge log jam in the desert
next to descend from the sky a torrent of firewood
one shower after another crashing to the plain
enough chopped lumber to fuel a thousand hearths
joining the rest of the debris is a deluge of slate sheets of shale from a great unseen quarry in the sky come slamming to earth
some of the pieces shattering some rebounding into the air until the granite litters acres of landscape as far as the eye can see
the camera commences a long slow pull back from the pile of elephant tusks
gradually they are revealed as human fingernails magnified many hundreds of times
the tree trunks are mere hair follicles
the firewood whiskers
the slate flakes of skin
a naked man thirties seen in profile is crouched upon a metal floor inside a small brushed stainless steel tank rubbing his skin raw with a wire brush
having completed his scrupulous ablutions jerome arches his lean frame through the small oval door of the metal room with practised ease
securing the thick fireproof windowed door behind himself he turns a switch to release gas into the vacated chamber
the gas instantly ignites in what is now revealed to be a gleaming modern stainless steel custom made incinerator
we refocus on a magnified close up of his exfoliated flesh in the incinerator as it blackens curls and burns
jerone covers himself with a silk robe and steps into a pair of backless slippers
jerome emerges from the incinerator room into a large luxurious loft style condo containing a bizarre assortment of equipment arranged somewhat like a production line
long scrupulously clean metal work benches are arranged along one entire wall
laid out on the benches in neat rows are dozens of plastic bags some filled some unfilled
instruments on trays various types of tweezers scissors and other less familiar utensils
round stainless steel containers filled with hairs of differing lengths and other body matter
jerome approaches another man slumped over one of the benches
he clutches an empty vodka bottle
he is snoring lightly sleeping off the night before
as jerome gently prises the bottle out of his hand we are struck by the similarity of eugenes face to jeromes
jerome pulls eugenes chair back from the desk with surprising ease
a wheelchair a modern ergonomic design
jerome wheels eugene to a bedroom and with some difficulty hauls the larger man onto the bed
through his alcoholic fog eugene feebly co operates his paralyzed legs a particular dead weight
after covering eugene with a blanket jerome enters a bathroom containing a surgically clean stainless steel basin sink shower and toilet
beside the toilet stands a large industrial style stainless steel refrigerator
donning protective gloves jerome opens the liquid nitrogen cooled refrigerator
a cloud of condensed water vapor billows out
revealed inside the fridge are racks of labelled jars and silicon pouches some containing a yellowish liquid some a deep red liquid
in front of one of the jars is a handwritten shopping list jerome smiles to himself as he retrieves the note along with one of the jars
he checks the jars label
satisfied with the date written there he breaks the seal and pours the contents into the clear silicon pouch of an iv like device lying on the steel bathroom counter
he seals the pouch and checks the apparatus by opening the valve on its fine tube and squirting a small quantity of the liquid into the nearby toilet bowl as
one would test a syringe
we remain on jeromes face as he reaches between his legs and inserts the pouch
reopening the refrigerator jerome slides out a tray containing neat rows of slim fingertip sized plastic sachets filled with a deep red colored liquid
he removes his gloves selects one of the sachets and carefully adheres the sachet to the pad at the end of his index finger
he prepares a second sachet for his middle finger
jerome then applies skin colored cover up makeup to the sachets blending them in with the color of his fingers
jerome still dressed in his robe climbs a large spiral staircase to the floor above
he emerges at the top of the staircase into a similarly large loft stlye condominium
through the floor to ceiling window that opens onto a balcony we see that dawn is only just starting to leak into the night sky
in the bedroom jerome removes a shirt from a drycleaning bag
printed on the bag confidentiality guaranteed he emerges from his bedroom dressed in a smart albeit unconventionally cut suit
he adjusts his tie in the mirror careful not to disturb the sachets attached to his fingertips
a lone man swims a ferocious lap of freestyle in what appears to be a pool of enormous length yet he never reaches the pools end
we pull wider to reveal that the man is swimming against an artificial current in a pool barely larger than himself
abruptly the man stops and stands up the fast flowing current instantly stilled
we glimpse the face of investigator lucas
thirties he has a youthful yet rigid face
we have the impression that he does not swim for pleasure
it is still early as jerome exits the buildings underground parking garage in an immaculate studebaker avanti and proceeds down the long straight driveway
he exchanges a wave with a gardener trimming a lawn
the whir of the cars electric powered engine belies its conventional appearance
jeromes car exits a highway and turns up the sweeping road leading to the parking lot of gattaca aerospace corporation
a sleek modern low rise industrial compound boasting perfectly manicured landscaped gardens
jerome strides purposefully up to the entranceway with hundreds of other gattaca employees
he carries himself with a certain arrogance a cool detachment
all employees wear similarly unconventionally cut suits short coiffed hair and robust tans
the gattaca employees are a seemingly equal split of men and women and a diverse range of ethnicities
they filter through a row of channels supervised by security guards
each channel contains a computerized security device featuring a slim groove in which the employee places a finger under the watchful eye of a security guard
jerome gives a polite nod to a guard as he places his index finger in the groove
his fingertip is jabbed with the finest of needles and a minute blood sample taken
the blood specimen confirms jeromes identity an id photograph appearing on a computer screen
out of the corner of his eye jerome spies a young woman entering through the adjacent channel
she is also sneaking a glance in his direction irene
catching each other looking they both quickly avert their eyes
as jerome enters the computer facility of gattaca aerospace corporation he furtively glances at the pin prick puncture in his fingertip sachet
a gattaca spacecraft skirts an asteroid
taking advantage of the rocks gravitational pull the craft slingshots deeper into the black void
then abruptly the craft and the asteroid freeze in mid space suddenly reverse direction and proceed forward again the spacecraft taking a slightly adjusted course
we pull back to reveal that the journey is merely a highly realistic graphic representation on a gattaca computer screen operated by jerome
appearing simultaneously alongside the computer animation is a seemingly never ending column of computer instructions for this celestial navigation the incomprehensible language of the computer programmer
x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x xfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfexfe jerome is transported plotting a path through the heavens
as his fingers fly across the keys he does not once take his eyes from the screen
his is one of hundreds of ergonomically designed work stations arranged in ever widening circles in a huge curcular well appointed if antiseptic room
each curved desk contains a computer terminal consisting of a keyboard and a slim transparent screen behind which is seated a programmer designing software for the aerospace agency
at the center of the room is a donut shaped command console chairs facing outwards from which operations are monitored
floor to ceiling smoked glass curved walls offer the only concession to nature a tinted view of a man made meticulously landscaped garden
jerome tears himself away from his screen and picks up a discreet mini vac
he vacuums between the keys of his keyboard
director josef s a shorter official looking man approaches
his assistant irene stands at his shoulder
you keep your work station so clean jerome
next to godliness isnt that what they say
the director smiles at the notion and places a computer disc on jeromes desk
i reviewed your flight plan
not one error in a hundred thousand keystrokes
placing a hand on jeromes shoulder its right that someone like you is taking us to the belt
glancing to notification on jeromes screen you have a substance test
the director briskly departs irene in tow
at a nearby work station a painfully thin programmer napoleon perks up at the mention of the test
jerome merely shrugs and pretends to reach down and scratch his ankle
however he surreptitiously produced one of eugenes transparent specimen bags from his sock
an extreme close up reveals the bags contents flakes of skin hair follicles eyelashes a fingernail
cupping the bag in his hand to avoid detection jerome sprinkles the fraudulent body matter over his keyboard desk surfaces and the floor around his work station
he opens his desk drawer and casually scatters the remainder of the bag
finally he inspects a comb already laced with two hair follicles
jerome rises from his work station and makes his way towards the testing lab
white coated lamar forties buzzcut a mans man checks jeromes eyes with an instrument
satisfied with his examination he passes a transparent plastic container to jerome
standing directly in front of the technician with his back to camera jerome opens his fly
a steady stream of urine begins to flow into the container from jeromes hidden pouch
staring admiringly at the discharge jerome
pisses on command
youve got a beautiful cock
i ever told you that jerome
deadpan as he continues to urinate only every time im in here
jerome hands the container to lamara who seals and label it as jerome refastens his trousers
i see a lot of cocks
i speak from experience
yours is a beautiful example
why didnt my folks order a cock like that for me
lamar pours the urine sample into a high tech device where it is instantly analyzed
the urine identifies jerone while also registering a negative drug reading
the computer reads walking jerome to the door if everything goes to plan this could be the last time i see you for a while
one week to go
please tell me youre the least bit excited
ill tell you at the end of the week
jerome enters the restroom and glances at the toilet stalls
only three in the bank of twenty is occupied
he tarries at the mirror above the uniform line of basins unnecessarily reknotting his tie
a toilet flushes and a colleague exits one of the stalls
he and jerome exchange a nod
when the man has exited the restroom jerome enters the mans vacated stall
jerome immediately feels around the back of the toilet bowl and detaches a secreted stainless steel container
with surprising swiftness and dexterity jerome removes an extremely fine contact lens from each eye and drops the pair into the toilet bowl
he inserts two replacement lenses from the container and reattaches it in its hiding place
jerome flushes the toilet and exits the stall
he checks in the mirror that his new contact lenses are properly inserted
walking back along one of the long glass walled corridors jerome becomes aware of a peculiar noise in the complex or to be more precise a lack of noise
the incessant tapping of computer keys has stilled
as jerome gazes through the glass walled corridor we see the reflection of his face deep in thought
the most unremarkable of events
jerome morrow navigator first class is only days away from a one year manned mission to gaspra in the outer asteroid belt
nothing so unique in that
last year over one thousand citizens from every walk of life embarked on some space mission or other
besides selection for jerome was virtually guaranteed at birth
he is blessed with all the physical and intellectual gifts required for such an arduous undertaking a genetic quotient second to none
jeromes gaze drifts to the sky
no there is truly nothing remarkable about the progress of jerome morrow except that i am not jerome morrow
a starry sky
the camera tilts down to find palm trees swaying against a setting sun
i was conceived in the riviera
not the french riviera
the camera tilts down further to find a buick riviera parked in a deserted beachfront parking lot on a polluted stretch of beach
the detroit variety
through the cars steamed windows we see jeromes mother and father maria and antonio early twenties making love
they used to say that a child conceived in love has a greater chance of happiness
they dont say that any more
maria wearing a medical gown lies on an examining table feet in stirrups
a nurse forties wheels an instrument tray towards her
maria suddenly disengages her feet from the stirrups and swings her legs off the table
what are you doing
shaking her head i cant do this
misinterpreting the problem i told you the government pays
its all taken care of
no you dont understand
i cant the nurse places a comforting hand on marias shoulder
reassuring the doctor will give you something
removing the hand adamant im not doing it
trying to make her see reason honey youve made one mistake the remark stings maria
softening her tone ive read your profile
i dont know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own
pause you can have other children
holding her swollen stomach protectively not like this one
trying to be diplomatic honey look around you
the world doesnt want one like that one
maria gets off the table and reaches for her clothes laying across a chair
irate you dont know what it will be
the nurse watches maria as she dresses genuinely bewildered
calling out to maria as she disappears out of the door the child wont thank you
we focus on a crucifix dangling on a rosary
tilting up we find the rosary clasped between maria and antonios intertwined hands
those were early days days when a priest could still persuade someone to put their faith in gods hands rather than those of the local geneticist
bathed in sweat maria gives a final push on the delivery table
while still attached to his umbilical cord the heel of the newborn baby boy is immediately pricked by a masked nurse
a minute drop of blood is inserted into an analyzing machine
even as the baby is put into marias arms page after page of data begins to appear on a monitor pulsing warning signals throughout the spreadsheets
two assisting nurses exchange a look
antonio senses something amiss
of course there was nothing wrong with me
not so long ago i would have been considered a perfectly healthy normal baby
ten fingers ten toes
that was all that used to matter
but now my immediate well being was not the sole concern
antonio turns his attention from his baby to the data appearing on the monitor
we see individual items highlighted amongst the data my destiny was mapped out before me all my flaws predispositions and susceptibilities most untreatable to this day
only minutes old the date and cause of my death was already known
antonio focuses on a final highlighted item on the monitors screen the name
typing details into birth certificate for the certificate
antonio correcting her no vincent antonio
with a computer stylus he signs the nurses handheld screen
for most of the following flashback running with a toy rocket falls more in clumsiness than fatigue
maria suddenly whisks up the toddler
hysterical oh vincent vincent vincent
i cant let you out of my sight
maria frantically listens to her young sons heartbeat
for his part vincent appears surprised by the attention
maria places a portable oxygen mask over vincents mouth
i was born vincent antonio luca
and from an early age i came to think of myself as others thought of me chronically ill
every skinned knee and runny nose treated as if it were life threatening
maria and antonio drop off dark haired year old vincent at a day care center
and my parents soon realized that wherever i went my genetic prophecy preceded me
while healthy children play outside on tricycles clamber over jungle gyms and finger paint the pre school teacher shows vincent into a room where children with obvious disabilities sleep on
maria wheels around and marches out of the center with vincent in her arms
antonio follows close behind pleading with his wife to see sense
they put off having any more children until they could afford not to gamble to bring a child into the world in what has become the natural way
antonio reluctantly shows off his spotless buick riviera to a prospective buyer
it meant selling the beloved buick
the two men haggle over the price while maria holding vincent in her arms looks on
finally money and a pink slip are exchanged
my father got a good price
after all the only accident hed ever had in that car was me
as the buyer drives away antonio shrugs to maria to hide his disappointment
antonio maria and year old vincent exit a packed commuter bus and enter a genetic counselling office building bearing the sign pro creation
a geneticist stares into a high powered microscope as antonio maria and year old vincent are shown into the office by a nurse
on the counter beside the geneticist is a glass doored industrial refrigerator containing petri dishes arranged on racks several feet high
to the nurse without taking his eyes from his binocular microscope put up the dish
while antonio and maria take a seat in front of a television monitor the nurse puts a labelled petri dish under a video equipped microscope
the geneticist swings around in his chair to greet his clients
four magnified clusters of cells eight cells on each cluster appear on the television screen
your extracted eggs
noting the couples names from data along the edge of the screen maria have been fertilized with
antonios sperm and we have performed an analysis of the resulting pre embryos
after screening were left with two healthy boys and two healthy girls
naturally no critical pre dispositions to any of the major inheritable diseases
all that remains is to select the most compatible candidate
maria and antonio exchange a nervous smile
first we may as well decide on gender
have you given it any thought
referring to the toddler on her knee we would like vincent to have a brother
you know to play with
the geneticist nods
he scans the data around the edge of the screen
youve already specified blue eyes dark hair and fair skin
i have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions premature baldness myopia alcoholism and addictive susceptibility propensity for violence and obesity interrupting anxious we didnt want diseases yes
more diplomatic we were wondering if we should leave some things to chance
reassuring you want to give your child the best possible start
believe me we have enough imperfection built in already
your child doesnt need any additional burdens
and keep in mind this child is still you simply the best of you
you could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result
squeezing marias hand hes right maria
maria is only half convinced but the geneticist swiftly moves on
is there any reason youd want a left handed child
blank er no
explaining some believe it is associated with creativity although theres no evidence
also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage
shrugs i like football
injecting a note of levity i have to warn you mr luca hes going to be at least a head taller than you
prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time
antonio beams proudly
scanning the data on the screen anything ive forgotten
hesitant about broaching the subject we want him we were hoping he would get married and have children
wed like grandchildren
conspiratorial smile i understand
thats already been taken care of
an afterthought now you appreciate i can only work with the raw material i have at my disposal but for a little extra
i could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability
suddenly enthused antonio the choir
interjecting covering himself i have to caution you its not fool proof
with multi gene traits there can be no guarantees
how much extra
it would be five thousand more
antonios face falls
im sorry theres no way we can
youll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb
rising to end the appointment we can implant the most successful pre embryo tomorrow afternoon
maria is staring at the four magnified clumps on the screen
what will happen to the others
reassuring they are not babies maria merely human possibilities
removing the petri dish from beneath the lens of the microscope he points out the four minuscule specks
smaller than a grain of sand
a red pencil draws a mark on a doorway at the height of a childs head
the child moves away and the name is written beside the mark by proud father antonio
thats how my brother anton came into the world a son my father considered worthy of his name
there is little physical similarity between year old anton and year old vincent standing beside him apart from their height
in fact vincent is mortified to see that his younger brothers mark is a fraction of an inch higher than the mark beside his own name vincent runs from the
year old vincent and year old anton sit together on a windswept beach
anton picks up a broken shell and deliberately slices the tip of his thumb with the sharp edge
he hands the shell to vincent who hesitantly follows suit
by the time we were playing at blood brothers i understood that there was something very different flowing through my veins
the two brothers press their thumbs together merging the blood
and id need an awful lot more than a drop if i was going to get anywhere
while antonio and maria doze under a beach umbrella anton and vincent enter the water diving through the waves
from above we watch their two young bodies swimming beside each other beyond the breakers
our favorite game was chicken
when our parents werent watching we used to swim outside the flags as far out as we dared
it was about who would get scared and turn back first
suddenly vincent stops swimming pulling up sharply in the water exhausted and fearful
he watches anton swim on into the distance
of course it was always me
anton was by far the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail
a teacher gives a physics lesson
the bespectacled year old vincent has his arm energetically raised at each opportunity but is never called upon
eventually he lowers his arm in defeat
my genetic scarlet letter continued to follow me from school to school
when youre told youre prone to learning disabilities its sometimes easier not to disappoint anybody
year old vincent stands at a cul de sac at the end of a long straight deserted street
he places a basketball in the middle of the street to represent the sun and begins to unwind the huge reel of string attached to the ball
year old anton walks a pace behind him
several yards along the trail a bead is threaded through the string to represent the planet mercury
how many astronauts are there anyway
vincent ignores him and continues to reel out the string
i bet could be one
vincent stops and regards his younger brother with contempt
youre standing on venus
anton lifts his foot
there is a bead beneath it
vincent has developed into a handsome year old
his spectacles hidden he and a young woman are necking in the front seat of a beat up car parked overlooking a huge satellite dish
i was popular enough until it got around that i wasnt a long term proposition
the love making intensifies
the young woman moves down vincents chest and unzips his fly
those who didnt know already could easily find out for themselves
it was certainly no problem coaxing the information out of me
we remain on vincents face as he climaxes
the young woman turns her head away from the spent jerome and out of his view trickles semen from her mouth into a clear specimen vial
i didnt blame them
you need to know if a prospective husband can qualify for a mortgage or life insurance or can hold down a decent job
in the living room of their modest home the dark haired year old bespectacled vincent sits opposite his parents
the crestfallen vincent has a book on his lap entitled careers in trying to break it gently vincent you have to be realistic
a heart condition like yours i dont care
ill take the risk
its not just you they have to be concerned about
perhaps we could get you one of those new pacemakers
theyre not perfect but letting his frustration show for gods sake vincent dont you understand
the only way youll see the inside of a space ship is if youre cleaning it
vincent looks at his father in disbelief
on a dinner table on the other side of the living room year old anton looks up from the biological specimen he is studying with a magnifying glass
year old vincent hides his glasses in his pocket as he enters a waiting room
he gazes around at other applicants
my father was right
it didnt matter how much i lied on my resume my real c
was in my cells
why should anybody invest all that money to train me when there are a thousand other applicants with a far cleaner profile
of course its illegal to discriminate genoism its called but no one takes the laws seriously
as jerome enters the office we focus on the doorhandle he has just touched
if you refuse to disclose they can always take a sample from a doorhandle
vincent hesitates before shaking the personnel officers outstretched hand
or a handshake
we focus on jeromes envelope attached to his application form sitting on the managers desk
even the saliva off your application form
sitting opposite the manager jeromes face falls
the manager puts a clear plastic cup in front of jerome
but for the most part we know who we are
and if all else fails a legal drug test can just as easily become an illegal peek at your future in the company
vincent saves the manager the trouble and exits the office leaving the cup where it sits
year old jerome walks up the beach to find year old anton sitting with the young woman vincent had previously dated
i didnt blame anton for his free ride
you cant blame someone for winning the lottery
the young woman hastily departs
later the two brothers face each other on the sand
anton is the more statuesque of the two
cocky you sure you want to do this
vincents answer is to walk towards the water
anton smiles mockingly at his brothers grim game face and follows
from an aerial view we watch vincent and his younger brother anton swim beyond the breakers
it was the last time we swam together
out into the open sea like always knowing each stroke towards the horizon was one we had to make back to the shore
like always the unspoken contest
we watch the two young men swimming stroke for stroke
they swim far out beyond the point
suddenly anton starts to slow his strokes becoming labored until he becomes motionless in the water
he begins to sink like a stone
vincent realizing anton is no longer beside him turns back to lend support
vincent takes him in a lifeguard hold and begins to nurse him back to shore
finally the two boys are coughed up onto the shallows
they collapse just beyond the waterline exhausted gasping for air
antonio and maria arrive on the scene
anton is the first to recover while vincent clutches his side his face screwed up in pain
maria kneels down and starts to administer to vincent but his father antonio is unable to conceal his anger and contempt for vincent
vincent you damn fool
you could have killed anton with your ridiculous contest
why should he risk his life to save yours
when are you going to get it through your thick head you cant compete with your brother
maria takes antonio aside
anton and vincent exchange a look
why didnt you say anything
why didnt you
staring back at his father knowingly its okay
its the way they want it
it confirmed everything in the minds of my parents that they had taken the right course with my younger brother and the wrong course with me
it would have been so much easier for everyone if had slipped away that day
i decided to grant them that wish
anton stands at the mantlepiece in the dimly lit living room
he gazes at a framed family portrait vincents face has been torn out of it
he suddenly spies vincent exiting the front gate carrying a suitcase
anton goes to shout vincents name but the words dont get out
a pick up truck packed with a cleaning crew pulls into the rear of the building
they are no longer strictly the migrant workers we have come to expect but rather a mixture of ethnicities all members of a genetic underclass that does not discriminate by
as vincent exits the truck and turns towards the camera we discover that he has now matured into the man we have come to know as jerome
the only visible differences are the glasses he wears and his hair still naturally dark
like many others in my situation i moved around a lot in the next few years getting work where i could
i must have cleaned half the toilets in the state
we follow vincent through the course of a day
cleaning restrooms toilets picking up litter sweeping washing windows gazing at the aerospace workers below
the building is part of the gattaca facility located near a shuttle launch site
throughout the day with the regularity of s vincent spies rocket ships in the distance launching into the sky
jeromes is the only head that turns and looks up
long after the sun has set vincent is still working
another rocket ship lights up the darkness
vincent gazes forlornly into the heavens
vincent cleans a window from the outside staring in at the arrogant gattaca employees entering the security channels a smaple taken from their fingertips
jerome in a trance constantly cleans the same spot of glass
he fails to notice an older janitor caesar appear beside him
when you clean the glass vincent dont clean it too well
confused what do you mean
glancing to the gattaca workers you might get ideas
but if the glass is clean itll be easier for you to see me when im on the other side of it
caesar smiles at vincents cockiness
vincent empties garbage into a dumpster adjacent to gattaca
his attention is drawn to something in the trash
a discarded manual on celestial mechanics and navigation
he wipes food residue off the corner
a forest of telescopes on tripods in an astronomy shop
vincent enters the store with a bucket and squeegee and immediately goes to clean the storefront window
the store owner looks up from his tabloid star magazine
lucky it was only the second floor
the owner nods and returns to his magazine
when he looks up again one of his tripods is missing its telescope and jerome is nowhere to be seen
jerome returns to his bare apartment
he removes the cloth covering the bucket to reveal a dumpy shaped telescope snugly wedged inside
he starts to pour over his collection of textbooks
other tattered space paraphenalia adorns the wall
of course the best test score in the world wasnt going to get me in the front door unless i had the blood test to go with it
while his fellow workers sit on the steps at the service entrance to gattaca passing around an unlabeled bottle of clear liquor vincent sits some distance away studying his text
in the absence of a computer he practices typing commands on a keyboard handdrawn on the flap of a cardboard box
a tiny seedy looking man german forties appears from nowhere and takes a seat beside him
offering his hand vincent im german anticipating vincents response thats my name
he looks the apprehensive vincent up and down
what do you think
shrugs i think i could do something glancing to the text book provided you know what youre doing and you can meet the terms
vincent pulls a plastic e money card from his overalls
you got a photo of yourself
vincent produces a snapshot of himself torn from the family portrait
german feeds the snapshot into the pocket sized computer he carries
the picture is instantly scanned and appears on the computers small color screen
german returns the photograph and hastily departs
caesar the elderly janitor notices germans exit
to vincent i thought i told you not to get any ideas
high up the side of a building washing windows vincent pauses occasionally to practice typing commands on his cardboard keys viewing a screen in his imagination or the nightsky itself
he hears his name being called
staring through his glasses german is that you
vincent come down
ive found him
german leads vincent through a maze of corridors
for the genetically superior success is easier to attain but is by no means guaranteed
after all there is no gene for fate
and when for one reason or another a member of the elite falls on hard times their genetic identity becomes a valued commodity for the unscrupulous
one mans loss is another mans gain
he gives a conspiratorial nod to another passing dna broker both men carrying their palm top computers
enthusiastically reading from data on his portable screen as he walks he has the heart of an ox
he could run through a goddamn wall if he could still run
actually he was a big college swimming star
i hope hes not just a body
before he dropped out he was an honor student the right majors how do i square the accident
still reading data from his palm top computer it happened in australasia
he checked in yesterday
no family complications no record he ever broke his neck
as far as anybodys concerned hes still a walking talking fully productive member of society
you just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life
correcting himself excuse me your life
german has stopped walking as if they have arrived
looking around for a likely candidate but finding none where is he
german reaches towards a paraplegic sitting in his wheelchair in the stairwell directly in front of them his head slumped an incriminating bong nestled in his lap
german pulls the mans head up by the hair
depsite the patchy unkempt beard and thick glaze over his eyes he bears a striking similarity to vincent
vincent holds a mirror beside the face of the lethargic eugene to compare his own reflection
smiling confidently what did i tell you
which ones the mirror
still not fully convinced thats the hair color in his profile
german checks an entry in his computer yeah
touching his own dark strands id have to bleach my hair
irritated impatient why are you inventing problems
you two are a couple of goddam clones
you look so right together i want to double my fee
a thought occurs addressing the paraplegic for the first time how tall are you
deadpan four foot six
vincent grins realizing that eugene is referring to his seated height
there is an instant connection between the two men
okay how tall did you used to be
apathetic still under the influence of whatever hes been smoking six one
to german disappointed hes too tall
shrugs you can wear lifts
even with lifts im never that tall
theres a way
in a primitive operating theatre vincent lies on a table his lower legs masked off for surgery
the surgeon switches on a surgical saw and lines it up with handdrawn incision marks
metal struts are ready to elongate his legs
german wheels the dazed eugene into the apartment cluttered with space paraphenalia
one wheel of his rusting wheelchair is flimsily held on with wire
vincent follows behind on crutches both lower legs in casts and cross braces
vincent signs the contract german puts in front of him
eugene glassy eyed strides out of a bar past camera and into the street
we hear a squeal of brakes and a sickening thud
eugene awakens with a scream bathed in sweat arms bound to a bed the only real piece of furniture in the room
vincent sitting on a crate beside him soaking a towel in a bowl of water is taken by surprise
eugene continues to scream and thrash fighting against his bindings
vincent stuffs the towel into eugenes mouth and holds onto his arms
i confess at first i wondered if i had rescued a man who was already dead
vincent holds eugenes head over the toilet bowl as he vomits violently
eugenes paralysis and vincents broken legs make the operation doubly difficult
finally eugene has nothing left in his stomach to vomit
he drops to the floor in exhaustion
vincent also exhausted from the effort of holding eugene over the bowl joins him on the broken linoleum
both men stare up at the ceiling that carries a map of the constellation
you okay jerome
ironically referring to their mutual immobility yeah
you want to go dancing tonight
eugene turns his nose up at the plate of boiled meat and potatoes that vincent puts in front of him
vincent catches the look
whats wrong with it
i think id better choose the menu
after all youre learning how to be me im not learning how to be you shrugs suit yourself
trying to be more diplomatic listen i dont want you to think im ungrateful i know you and that little broker what do you call him
youre both going to a lot of trouble trying to be tactful maybe you can con somebody into believing youre me to get your foot in the door but once
youre inside youre on your own
im sure youre sincere
glancing to the space paraphenalia but i was being groomed for something like this myself
even without the accident i dont think i would have made it
my point is how the hell do you expect to pull this off
jerome merely stares back as if the thought of failure has never occurred to him
shrugs and states it simply i dont know exactly jerome
laughing at least youre honest
a thought occurs call me by my middle name eugene if youre going to be jerome you may as well start getting used to it
jerome looks through eugenes personal effects including a photograph album
he is drawn to a swimming medal inside the album at a page displaying a photo of a wealthy austere mother eugene evidently comes from money
even as he wheels into the room in his rickety wheelchair we see that eugene has the bearing of someone of good breeding
he has a bag of blood on his lap
more blood is being drawn from his arm through an iv
eugene catches jerome looking at the album
guiltily closing the book i have to know where you come from
if anybody asks tell them the truth your family disowns you
you are a disappointment jerome
referring to eugenes medal impressed what about this
tossing the bag of blood to jerome its not easy living up to this
eugene wheels away
jerome practises writing with his right hand trying to replicate eugenes signature
wheeling by looking over jeromes shoulder at the signature it needs work
rueful you had to be a right hander
noone orders southpaws anymore
a pair of spectacles lie on the bed
jerome still wearing his twin casts sits behind an optometrists portable examining device
german hovering in the background an optometrist custom fits jerome with gossamer thin contact lenses
myopia is a dead giveaway one of the earliest and most justifiable of the quality of life corrections
anybody with impaired vision is certain to be suffering from all the other deficiencies of a nonadvantaged birth
inspecting the lens in jeromes eye its no good
i can see an edge
he may as well walk in there with a cane
the optometrist has been replaced in the living room with a black market dentist who bonds jeromes small gapped teeth to match eugenes perfectly straight white picket fences
hair already bleached and cut to match eugenes hairstyle jerome sits in a chair against a hastily erected white paper backdrop
from his wheelchair eugene puts the finishing touches to jeromes hair
he wheels himself out of the way
the final accomplice in jeromes deception a black market computer graphics designer takes jeromes photo with a video camera
manipulating the captured image the designer morphs jeromes face into the face of eugene
the resulting photo that spits out of a printer is neither one nor the other but an acceptable combination of the two
eugene is starting to prepare jeromes specimen bags for the first time
he winces in pain as he plucks several hairs from his head
jerome now out of his casts prepares job applications
still grimacing referring to the follicles you really need that much
more than that
youll get used to it
yanking out another hair god what wouldnt you do to leave the planet
inspecting a hair follicle leave
just a few million years ago every atom in this hair in our bodies was a part of a star
i dont see it as leaving
i see it as going home
marvelling at jeromes earnestness god youre serious arent you
jerome ignores him
having learnt his lesson he hands the envelopes to eugene to lick the flaps
jerome is doing a late minute cram on a geriatric computer from the late s
checking the time jerome hurriedly picks up the shirt that eugene has been ironing from a prone position on the floor
its not too late to back out
you dont know what a relief it is not to be me
are you sure you want the job
jerome contemplates the question for a moment
what about you
whats in this for you eugene
referring to the bladder bag he wears listen i bag this stuff anyway
it may as well pay my rent
jerome hurrise to the bathroom where with some difficulty he inserts his urine device for the first time
the new improved jerome emerges into the living room ready for his interview
jerome emerges from a bathroom and hands a technician his plastic cup full of fraudulent urine and inserts it into the analyzer
reading off the profile congratulations
perplexed what about the interview
referring to the cup that was it
jerome scarcely able to disguise his delight exits gattaca trying not to stare at the superb specimens who are now his colleagues
the majority of people are now made to order
what began as a means to rid society of inheritable diseases has become a way to design your offspring the line between health and enhancement blurred forever
eyes can always be brighter a voice purer a mind sharper a body stronger a life longer
everyone seeks to give their child the best chance but the most skilled geneticists are only accessible to the priveleged few
in a nearby park model children from model parents play together
anyone who is the product of an altered dna is proudly referred to as a dan self made man or woman man child
jerome wheels eugene out of their housing project
he takes in the neighborhood for the last time
we focus on a poor couple cradling an infant
those parents who for moral or more likely economic reasons refrain from tampering with their offsprings genetic makeup or who fail to abort a deprived fetus condemn their children to
a life of routine discrimination
we glimpse other people in the neighborhood
they appear poor but for the most part physically normal
however a pall of gloom hangs over them
officially they are called in valids
also known as godchildren men of god faith births blackjack births deficients defectives genojunk ge gnomes the fucked up people
in valid pronounced as in an invalid license they are the healthy ill
they dont actually have anything yet they may never
but since few of the pre conditions can be cured or reversed it is easier to treat them as if they were already sick
as they enter a car driven by german jerome spies a beautiful young girl sitting on the steps of the housing project staring forlornly into space
while there is no outward sign of any deficiency she is somehow aware that she is damaged goods
jerome glances in the rearview mirror
by means of a donor i have cheated the system for the last four years to open doors that would otherwise be closed to me
jerome wheels eugene into the palatial condominium complex where the two men now reside
we return to jeromes reflection in the glass
other gattaca employees are gradually gathering behind him
in the guise of jerome morror i have risen quickly through the ranks of gattaca
only one of the mission directors has ever come close to discovering my true identity
we now see what jerome has been gazing at through the window the whole time the sight that has brought a hush to the complex
through an open office door lies the body of a large man the murdered director lying where he has just been discovered in a pool of his own blood
strange to think he may have more success exposing me in death than he did in life
jerome wipes his eye and also goes to investigate
we focus on an extreme close up of his eyelash
loosened by jeromes hand it breaks free and floats gently down to the floor where it comes to rest
detective hugo late forties wearing a crime scene hygenic suit and gloves and a full clear mask looking more like a surgeon or a toxic waste worker than a detective
places a blood spattered computer keyboard alongside the directors shattered skull
the indentations match the blunt corner of the keyboard
hugo detaches the dangling keyboard from its parent computer and seals the likely murder weapon in a marked transparent plastic bag
a crew of similarly suited homicide detectives systematically vacuum the surrounding office area with metallic industrial looking mini vacs
once each work space has been vacuumed the transparent plastic vacuum bag is detached sealed and labelled
other detectives video the scene with camcorders
video prints spit out of the cameras for instant inspection
a silicon police tape cordons off the crime scene
from the landscaped garden a crowd of gattaca employees view the proceedings through the glass walls
staring at the directors body awful
yeah awful it didnt happen sooner nervous smirks from nearby employees
we focus on jerome
standing slightly apart from the others he does not appear to share the joke or perhaps even hear it
jerome watches wide eyed as a detective approaches his work station with a mini vac
a chill goes through jerome as the detectives cleaner passes over his desk
jerome is distracted by a smear on the window obstructing his view
without thinking he breathes on the glass and rubs the smear away with his elbow
nearby elderly janitor caesar notices jeromes fastidious act and reads the panic in jeromes eyes
director josef suddenly appears at jeromes shoulder
standing a pace behind the director computer notepad in hand is irene
youre lucky to be getting out of this
were still going ahead as planned
the launch window is only open until weeks end
tragic though this event may be it hasnt stopped the planets turning
he glances towards a group of detectives headed by hugo
youll have to excuse me jerome
i have to meet with the authorities naturally were co operating in any way although i wont tolerate a major disruption
as he departs i wish i was going with you jerome
as the pair depart jerome and irene exchange a glance
irene is also aware of jeromes unease
we focus on jeromes eyelash still lying on the floor
a huge crescent shaped hair that fills the screen
suddenly there is a roar of a mini vac and the eyelash is sucked up
we follow the eyelashs journey down the throat of the cleaner into the specimen bag where it is sucked against the bags clear plastic wall
the directors corpse is sealed in a plastic bodybag and wheeled away on a gurney
the blood and other body matter from the murder scene is sucked up by a portable wet vac and the sample bag appropriately labeled
a chime sounds over the p
follwed by an announcement
thank you for your co operation
please return to your work stations immediately
the programmers get to their feet en masse and begin filing into the work room
sarcastic aside what no counselling
a woman assistant whose keyboard was used in the attack has to pause as a maintenance worker gives her work station a final spray to return it to its former
a new keyboard is plugged into her monitor to replace the one taken as evidence
jerome opens his desk drawer to check his comb now plucked completely clean
he carefully places two of eugenes hairs to the comb and scatters another bag of fraudulent matter around his work station
in a large bare room a simulator does a slow dance back and forth on its hydralic legs miming the path of the space craft jerome will soon be aboard
the simulation ends and jerome exits the simulator through a small door
irene hesitantly approaches carrying a slim electronic tablet
excuse me jerome
im sorry to bother you
jerome turns not displeased by the interruption
referring to her notepad ive been asked to compile a log for the investigators they want to know everyones whereabouts last night
i was at home
irene makes a note with her stylus
can that be er verified
were you alone
no it cant be verified
yes i was alone
irene makes another note
wry smile looks bad doesnt it irene
what about you
where were you last night
i was at home
were you alone
teasing so we dont know for sure about you either
wary wondering where the conversation is headed no
why dont we say we were together
confused why would we do that
i have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot
irene contemplates the question
gently pressing well shall we say we spent the evening together
irene is still unsure whether or not jerome is serious
to be convincing jerome i would have to know what that was like
irene turns and departs
jerome watches her go
the paraplegic eugene seated by the window meticulously cuts a long fingernail into numerous clippings
he places the clippings in small plastic bags and seals them
he then begins to fill tiny sachets with blood
he turns as he hears jerome enter down the spiral staircase with the groceries
you didnt forget the truffles
jerome places the items in the refrigerator in the bathroom and retrieves a bottle of vodka the vodka incongruous looking beside the blood and urine specimens
joining eugene at his workbench he pours them both a drink
sensing something amiss trying to keep his humor who died
the mission director
misinterpreting the deadpan remark you wish
they found him in his office this morning beaten so bad they had to check his nametag
eugene takes in the news a smile broadening across his face
what an act of benevolence a service to the community
so thats it
now theres nothing between you and ignition
he was still warm when they confirmed
confused by jeromes attitude this calls for a celebration
the place is crawling with hoovers
you didnt kill him did you
jerome shoots him a glance for the inappropriate remark
thats not the point
scoffing hey how much of you can be there
even if the j
edgars do find something in a week glancing up to the night sky youll be slightly out of their jurisdiction
gently chiding come on weve got to get drunk immediately
still tempering eugenes enthusiasm youre going to have to earn your supper
ive got my final physical tomorrow
jerome wheels eugenes chair to a specially constructed platform that allows the wheels to spin in mid air
jerome tapes an electrode to eugenes chest and attaches the wire to a slim recording device
eugene begins to spin the wheel of the chair faster and faster
jerome monitors eugenes steady heartbeat through a set of headphones
the complex is virtually empty only a handful of the hundreds of programmers working late into the night
irene approaches jeromes work station on the pretext of delivering some documents
trying to act casually she looks under the papers on his desk then opens the top desk drawer
we see an extreme close up of the comb lying there the two hairs trapped between the teeth of the comb
irene removes one of the follicles and drops it into an envelope she is carrying
sequencing while u wait
similar to a hour photo lab the store little more than a booth displays a price list on the wall
irene waits in line with a cross section of other customers
she checks the contents of the envelope that contains the hair
the young woman in line ahead of her allows the technician to take a swab from her full lips with a q tip
mustering patience referring to the q tip the specimen proudly i kissed him five minutes ago
a real good one
overhearing several people in the line snicker
long suffering ill see what i can do
the technician hands the swab to an assistant
the young woman is handed a number and takes a seat
irene hands her envelope over the counter
she too is handed a number
we follow jeromes follicle as another technician places it in an analyzing machine
the technician returns the envelope to irene along with a miniature compact disc
remarking on the profile result
irene does not appear to share the technicians enthusiasm
she emerges from the sequencing lab and enters her car
taking a palm top computer from her purse she inserts the disc into the computer
jeromes counterfeit genetic profile appears on the screen
the details confirm her worst fears
jerome and eugene dressed to the nines pull up in the car to a darkened doorway in a poorly lit street
a valet appears out of the shadows
familiar with the car he goes immediately to the trunk to retrieve eugenes collapsible wheelchair
jerome tips the valet a credit card wiped through a device
the chic elegant establishment inside belies its darkened exterior
jerome wheels eugene into a decadent dinner club full of an odd assortment of people
they are immediately greeted respectfully by michael the owner and maitre d
jerome and eugene are obviously regulars
good evening gentlemen
your table is ready
referring to jeromes mission not long now sir
youll be upstairs before you know it
were going to miss you
not as much as ill miss your stroganoff
id like to take one of your chefs with me
in a secluded booth jerome and eugene toast from a bottle of vintage bordeaux
eugene drinks longer than jerome
jerome dabs his mouth with a napkin
he fails to notice a minute flake of skin dislodged from his chin
we follow the flake as it comes to rest beneath the table
later eugene and jerome watch couples dancing a samba on the dance floor
a waiter vacuums the table with a discreet handheld miniature vacuum while a waitress clears the plates
she accidentally drops a knife onto eugenes leg
aghast at the sight of his lifeless legs im so sorry
did i hurt you
smiling a trace of bitterness honey if youd hurt me id be cured
eugene the worse for drink gropes for the waitresss leg but she easily avoids his clumsy pass
you want to meet a real life spaceman
jerome always aware scanning the club suddenly spies napoleon his gattaca colleague on the other side of the room
napoleon is taking a hit from a vial concealed in his hand
jerome abruptly turns his back to avoid being recognized
lets get out of here
knocking back his drink misinterpreting the hasty departure youre right theres more atmosphere where youre going
driving along the freeway jeromes car suddenly dives down an escape road
eugene looks sideways at jerome
the car careens around and around a small circular building a cloud of dust billowing up behind the car
we focus on a brick wedged against the cars gas pedal
eugene is at the wheel jerome in the passenger seat
the hard turn is repeated with increasing recklessness eugene fighting to control the bucking car
screaming in both fear and exhilaration i gotta stop
i gotta stop
finally the car spins to a halt in a cloud of dust
when the dust settles it is revealed that they have been circling the base of a huge satellite dish in a desolate location
eugene lies on the hood of the car leaning against the windshield drinking from a bottle of vodka
in the background the unmanned satellite dish
jerome relieves himself against the building at the base of the satellite
gently chiding jerome over the joyride you idiot
you could ruin everything with a stunt like that
eugene spies a spacecraft launching from gattaca city
gazing up into the night sky at least up there your piss will be worth something
smiling at the thought youll all be showering in it right
zipping his fly and drinking it
its like evian by the time its filtered
referring to the rocket ship what is that one
jerome doesnt bother to look in the direction of the craft but merely glances to his watch
he joins eugene on the hood of the car
looking at his watch
to the port
a maintenance crew
how long do you stay up there before you go
a day or so
beaming i still cant believe theyre sending you to the belt you of all people never meant to be born on a mission to discover the origin of life
eugene laughs to himself and passes the bottle to jerome
you should be going instead of me
jerome taps eugenes lifeless legs with his foot
up there they wouldnt be a problem
glancing heavenwards shaking his head you know im scared of heights
the body and clothing of the mission director lying on a metal examining table is scanned with a blue light magnifying instrument
fingernail specimens are taken for analysis
in another area of the laboratory the labelled vacuum bags are attached to analyzers and the contents sucked out and automatically identified
id names and photographs of gattaca employees begin appearing on a computer screen at high speed along with other personal details all data automatically logged for later review
the photographs and personal details of jerome and irene flash past amongst the faces of other employees
we focus on a magnified close up of jeromes eyelash still clinging stubbornly to the side of its specimen bag
we continue to follow its journey as it is finally sucked into the analyzer
inside the machine a minute cell thin sliver is sliced from jeromes eyelash and analyzed
a severed human tongue sits on a tray in a sterile sealed chamber
using gloves that protrude through the chambers glass wall face buried in a binocular eyepiece the investigator takes a swab from the tongue
to the tongue as he inserts the tip of the swab into an analyzer lets see what youve got to say for yourself
a female assistant looking on hardly has time to smile at the remark before information begins to appear on a nearby computer terminal
the computer gradually builds a portrait of the owner of the tongue using genetic predictors
the investigator wanders over to the window as his assistant reads the information from the screen
the tongue is male
pronounced caucasian nose
slightly bow legged
interest piqued blind
mildly amused checking the monitor for himself the tongue is blind
confused who cuts out the tongue of a blind man
shrugs someone who is mindful that the blind still speak
the investigator is alerted by the chime of his nearby computer
on the screen he discovers the face of year old vincent and the accompanying flashing message having plugged his car into an overnight charger jerome pushes eugene in his wheelchair
to the elevator
bottle in hand eugene leans over and vomits on the ground
jerome shakes his head resignedly
eugene looks drunkenly up at jerome
sarcastically referring to the pool of vomit im sorry
did you want it
jerome meets eugenes gaze
there is a trace of bitterness in eugenes drunken smile
let me get it for you
eugene bends down to scoop up some vomit with his hand but the elevator arrives and jerome quickly wheels him away
eugenes head flops to the side as he passes out
jerome unlocks eugenes condo and wheels his chair inside
we see their reflection in a full length mirror as jerome pushes eugene to the bedroom
after removing eugenes soiled clothing he heaves the tall man from the chair and onto the bed
maudlin sobbing like a child im sorry
attempting to comfort its okay eugene
you know i wasnt drunk i knew what i was doing when i walked in front of that car what car
go to sleep
i walked right in front of it
i was never more sober in my life
jerome looks at eugenes lifeless legs trying to cover his shock at the revelation
its all right
grabbing jerome by the collar im proud of you vincent
eugenes head falls back onto the pillow
smiling to himself you must be drunk to call me vincent
but eugene does not reply drifting into sleep once again
jerome pulls a blanket over him
on the verge of leaving jeromes attention is drawn to a wall on the far side of the room
approaching the wall near eugenes mirrored closet he detects a faint mechanical whir coming from inside the adjacent condominium
jerome contemplates investigating but exits the condominium instead climbing the spiral staircase to his own condominium
jerome fastidiously vacuums with an upright cleaner
using a hose attachment he cleans around a picture frame that contains jeromes original computer keyboard handdrawn on the flap of a cardboard box
in the vast room of computer programmers we pull focus to discover that we have been filming the complex through the transparent specimen bag containing jeromes eyelash
on the mezzanine floor overlooking the scene of the crime the investigator holds the bag transfixed by the lash
the lead homicide detective detective hugo finishes interviewing a gattaca security guard and approaches the investigator
a large telescope in the background
although hugo is deferential to his more youthful superior his body language betrays his displeasure
hugo clearly does not relish the investigators involvement in his case
i dont understand why you were dragged out here sir
its hardly worth wasting your time a no nothing case like this
gently rebuking his subordinate a mans dead detective
of course sir
were checking the entry log alibis grudges
looking out over the balcony i look around i see a lot of dry eyes
the director was not
searching for the words universally loved
he was leading the cut backs in the program
youre looking at a room full of motives
shaking his head adamantly referring to the bag in his hand no this is your man
not so convinced with respect sir it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests what about his profile
hugo refers to a print out of year old vincents profile including his genetic quotient
the fifteen year old photo of vincent now bears little resemblance to his assumed identity
according to this hes a sick man
congenital heart condition
who knows how long the specimen has been here but theres an percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes
terse so theres a percent chance hes not dead
detective hugo goes to comment further then revises his remark in his head before speaking
even if this vincent luca is alive is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death
not likely the investigators tone suggests that the identity of the culprit is no longer a matter for debate
there is an awkward pause before the detective falls into step with his superior
i take it youre thinking along the lines of a robbery gone sour a thief disturbed in the act
the investigator merely shrugs
skeptical of course that doesnt jibe with what we found
this was an angry killing
glancing to the profile in hugos hand who knows with these deficients
his profile indicates a proclivity for violence
trying to appear co operative ill run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections ive already run it
theres no record of any living relative
what a pity
irritated glancing to the sample bag detective hugo its a simple case of lost and found
all we have to do is locate the man whos minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself
we focus on jerome at his work station
although he continues to work he clrarly feels the presence of the investigators on the mezzanine floor behind him
a medical director approaches the programmer in the neighboring work station napoleon the programmer jerome encountered in the nightclub the previous evening
napoleon youre late for your substance test
napoleon looks up ashen faced
director napoleons helping me today
the director regards both men suspiciously
well you take it for him jerome
the medical director departs
napoleon stunned by the reprieve approaches jeromes work station and pretends to study the program on his computer screen
why did you do that
exiting to the testing lab dont worry about it
from behind we observe jerome standing in front of lamar issuing forth his steady stream of fraudulent urine
twenty gattaca employees identically outfitted men and women run in a perfectly straight line towards the tranquil lake of the picturesque grounds never getting any closer to their goal
they run at a steady mph on twenty identical state of the art treadmill machines sunken into the floor and arranged in a uniform row facing a floor to ceiling
the strain is beginning to show on many of the faces
the heartrate of each employee is monitored via a wireless electrode attached to the chest
outside in the sunshine the next batch of twenty employees limbers up in readiness for their physical
jeromes only preparation consists of thoughtfully dragging on a cigarette while staring out at the man made lake
his nonchalant attitude disheartens nearby colleagues including irene who is amongst a group of workers excused from the run by benevolent over protective trainers
youre excused irene
you may resume your duties
on the way into the work out facility jerome stubs out his cigarette in a stainless steel ashtray
only we are aware of the slim credit card sized recording device that he furtively slips out of his cigarette pack and secrets in his hand
as he takes his place on one of the treadmills and adheres the cordless electrode to his chest jerome surreptitiously attaches his device to the underside of the running machines
from a mezzanine floor above the work out room lamar the medical officer monitors computer read outs displaying the pace and pulse of the runners on each treadmill machine
one by one the gattaca employees drop out until jerome is the sole remaining runner
several of the other employees stand around and watch jerome run as they towel off
he appears under little duress staring directly ahead seemingly in a trance
as we focus on his chest only we are aware of the sound of his furiously pounding heart making a lie of his calm exterior
jeromes heart registers a far more measured beat on the computer in the observation room
the director is at lamars shoulder beaming proudly
marveling at jeromes heartrate six miles later its still beating like a goddamn metronome
i could play piano by that heartbeat of his
the investigator and detective hugo enter the observation room escorted by irene
director josef this is our lead investigator
the two men exchange a polite handshake
however the investigator is immediately taken with the sole runner with his back to him on the treadmill below
how often do you test director
intrigued surely you know what you have
we have to be certain
once theyre up we can hardly turn the boat around
on the treadmill below jerome glances to his watch as he runs the distress starting to show
caught up in the conversation lamar has forgotten to end the work out
remembering he finally presses the warm down button slowing the treadmill
still marveling at jerome i swear if i went to lunch and came back hed still be there
we focus on jeromes recording device attached to the bottom of the control panel
it clicks to a stop indicating that the bogus heartbeat recording has ended before the workout
the heartbeat monitor in the observation room suddenly races from to beats per minute
lamar catches the discrepancy out of the corner of his eye but before he can take a second look jerome has whipped his electrode from his chest
the physician shrugs it off as a glitch in the machine
the investigator has turned his back on jerome to face the director
we believe we have a suspect
what a relief
referring to the profile of vincent on hugos computer notepad this unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor
in the room below jerome nonchalantly steps off the treadmill stealthily retrieves the recording device from beneath the control panel and returns it to his cigarette pack
he casually wipes off drops of sweat from the machine with a towel briefly glances to irene with the investigators and exits to the locker room
the director idly regards the image of vincent on hugos handheld screen
he does not recognize the face
an age enhancement is being prepared as we speak
referring to his assistant irene will make it available to security
jerome wears his assured smile all the way along the corridor and into the now empty locker room
he exchanges a cheery greeting with an exiting colleague enters a shower stall closes the door behind him and promptly collapses on the shower stall floor
the effects of the gruelling work out are only now apparent
no longer sucking up the pain he gulps air into his oxygen starved lungs his heart looking for a way through his tightened chest
he writhes in agony on the white tiled floor a brutal reminder of the physical frailty he seeks to disguise
in gattacas perfectly landscaped gardens jerome dressed and recovered from his ordeal joins his colleagues for lunch at one of the umbrella covered tables
while most of the others pick at unappetizing salads and take their individualized medication jerome carries a steak sandwich on his tray
the sight of the juicy steak is greeted with envious looks from his colleagues
jerome pretends not to notice and rubs it in by liberally sprinkling salt onto the meat
however when jerome looks over towards irene she avoids eye contact
when she abruptly gets up and leaves jerome follows thinking twice before depositing the napkin in the nearby trashcan
a janitor reaches for the napkin
it is the old janitor caesar from jeromes former life
ill take care of that for you mr morrow
the two men exchange a conspiratorial smile
a forest of wind turbines supplying energy to the aerospace complex
however the blades of the turbines are motionless in the still afternoon
jerome finally catches up with irene
she turns unsurprised by his appearance
standing beside her he looks out over the complex as if he too has come for the view
eyes fixed on the view we were looking at each other
irene also keeps her gaze ahead
i didnt mean anything
shrugging as if it makes no difference to him we were just looking
i know about you
jerome turns to her startled trying to read her face
irene takes a deep breath and abruptly plucks a long dark hair from her head
offering the hair to jerome here take it
jerome confused takes the hair more in reflex than intent
a challenge if youre still interested let me know
jerome contemplates the hair in his fingers for a moment then deliberately lets it fall to the grounf
never taking his eyes from her sorry the wind caught it
irene meets his gaze
there is not a breath of wind
the hair lies plainly visible on the ground
as jerome and irene walk between the wind turbines jerome pretends not to notice that irene keeps furtively checking the pulse on her wrist
they pause in the shade
as if making conversation have they found our friend
shrugs it was a mercy killing after all
they found an eyelash
in the south wing
does it have a name
just some in valid
vincent trying to come up with the last name somebody
jerome turns away to disguise his alarm
he quickly recovers
perhaps we ought to celebrate irene
a smile playing around her lips you celebrate jerome
eugene talks irritably on the phone examining a container from a newly opened case of hair bleach
into phone i know what i ordered
i ordered honey dawn and you sent me summer wheat
jerome descends the staircase taking the steps two at a time
he immediately goes to the refrigerator removing trays of samples
eugene abruptly hangs up the phone
any particular reason
collecting up sample bags from the work bench we cant stay here
what are you talking about
they think i offed the director
eugene wheels himself over to jerome unconcerned
what makes them think that
they found my eyelash
a flicker of anxiety where
in a corridor
blase once again could be worse
they could have found it in your eye
jerome half smiles despite the situation
resuming his collection of samples come on were taking off
im not going anywhere
less than a week to go
not on your life you dont understand theyll make the connection theyll hoover again
we should cut our losses
angrily grabbing a tray from jeromes hands where is your head jerome
youre acting like a guilty man
they wont marry the eyelash to you
they wont believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years
theyll recognize me
scoffing how could they recognize you
referring to the torn photo of year old vincent on the wall dont recognize you
anyway you dont have a choice
you run you may as well sign a confession turn us both in right now
no we stick this out find out what we can but change nothing
this is a minor inconvenience is all it is
weve taken worse heat than this
angry now jesus if id known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp i wouldnt have bothered
you cant quit on me now
ive put too much into this
returning the samples to the fridge besides this stuff is mine i had other offers you know
i could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine
you want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself
meeting jeromes gaze well take off all right from pad just like we planned
jerome slumps down in a chair eugenes tirade starting to get to him
and keep your lashes on your lids where they belong
how could you be so careless
reluctant admission i think i was crying
eugene is uncomfortable at the notion
well save those tears
jerome shrugs awkwardly and pours them both a drink
you really had other offers
shrugs im sure i could have
the naked jerome scrapes away at his skin with even greater ferocity than usual
after exiting the incinerator he deposits all the incriminating trash he has collected during the day into the furnace and ignites the gas
from outside a car horn sounds
jerome in a formal suit and spectacles abruptly enters the condominium
he goes to a closet and starts searching through eugenes clothes
mind if i borrow a tie
eugene is more interested in the car parked outside the condominium
irene sits in a convertible citroen ds dressed in a classic but provocative black suit
unaware that she is being observed she touches up her lipstick in the rearview mirror
so its not just the hoovers whove got you rattled
youre the one who said not to change anything
shes my ear to the investigation
skeptical is that all
ive got enough on my mind without that
if you say so
referring to the ties in jeromes hand the stripe
agreeing with the selection good choice
jerome fumbles with the knot
from his chair eugene knots jeromes tie for him
jerome is intrigued that for once eugene is abstaining he has not touched his drink
referring to the fridge weve got enough virgin samples to last us the week
i dont feel too good
i think im still drunk from last night
never stopped you before
regarding eugenes head and for gods sake stop plucking your hair
someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldnt go bald
if i were you id worry about myself
nodding to jeromes spectacles havent you forgotten something
jerome pockets the spectacles and enters the bathroom for his contact lenses
the horn sounds outside the window a second time and jerome hastily exits
we stay with eugene
irene catches a glimpse of him before he moves away from the window
jerome emerges from the building
as the couple drive away eugene wheels himself to the full length mirror
he regards his own reflection for a moment and opens the mirror a disguised door opening into the adjacent apartment
a cloud of condensed water vapor billows out
german the dna broker emerges with an engineer
he sends the engineer on his way and joins eugene at his desk
eugene hands german a credit card that he wipes through his computer
we still need to overhaul the back up generator
fixing eugene with a penetrating stare whats going on eugene i thought he was going away not you you going on vacation
looking away you got it german
nodding thoughtfully you deserve it
jerome and irene step over feet apologizing as they go eventually finding their seats in a box in a sold out concert hall
on the stage below a young pianist a teenage prodigy has already taken his place at the keys of a grand piano
the pianist removes his white gloves and begins to play an extremely complex and beautiful piece we have never heard before
irene looks to jerome
he is clearly caught up in the music
the music from the piano recital continues under the following contrasting action
a huge brooding housing project
people hang around on street corners
menace in the air a feeling of impending violence
suddenly unmarked police cars appear from all directions blocking any escape route
dozens of plainclothes detectives pour out of the cars and onto the street
people scatter many running straight into the arms of the detectives
others spilling out of the housing project are also immediately apprehended
the detectives quickly weed out those suspects not fitting jeromes description women old men and teenagers
they are shepherded off the street
a line of in valids is formed several hundred yards long
detectives begin to laboriously move along the line taking finger prick blood samples from each suspect instantly confirming their identities with portable analyzers worn on their hips
as if having the idea at the same time two separate men suddenly bolt from the line knowing that their blood will incriminate them
other detectives watching for such escape attempts esaily apprehend them and escort them to a waiting police van
with the raid under control detective hugo indicates to the investigator that it is safe to exit his car
the investigator appears irritated only half glancing at the two men already in custody apparently certain that neither one is his suspect
enthusiastic not our fish but sometihng stuck in the net
the investigator clearly does not share hugos enthusiasm
the detective offers the investigator an age enhanced photograph computer generated from the last existing photo of vincent as a year old
this is the age enhancement were working with
the investigator ignores the photo preferring instead to trust his own eye as he wanders along the line of suspects
referring to the line up as you requested weve kept the parameters wider than usual
the men they scrutinize are hardly mutants the differences between an in valid and a dan are subtle at best
some shorter some wearing glasses some with receding hairlines or bald many with no discernable physical difference at all
the investigator is only halfway down the line before he turns and starts walking back to his car
the mystified detective hugo follows his superior
were in the wrong place
were wasting time
this is the most likely location the investigator wheels on hugo suddenly angry clearly unused to having his judgement questioned
theres that word again
i have a feeling this man doesnt play the odds detective
not exactly a slave to probability
is it likely that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years a brutal killer is going to come to us now like a lamb
taken aback by the outburst is there something more we should know about this suspect sir
i mean besides whats on his sheet
since going underground traces of this in valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies
do you need any more than that
with respect sir many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes
maybe hes just unlucky
i dont like anybody this unlucky
pause widen the sweep
the west side
draw a five mile radius around gattaca
hoover some of the classier establishments
random car stops
were already getting complaints about frivolous search
this is a murder investigation
the public should be happy to co operate to get this disease off the streets
a standing ovation
the young pianist on the stage bows deeply soaking up the applause of the audience
the pianist tosses one of his white gloves into the front row where it is caught by an adoring fan
the second glove he tosses up to the box where jerome and irene are standing
jerome snares the glove out of the air and immediately hands it to irene
she promptly slips the glove on her own hand
the glove fits snugly over her five fingers
however one finger of the glove remains unfilled
jerome is stunned to realize that it is a six fingered glove
catching his look of astonishment you didnt know
trying hard to convince yes
yes picking up a resentment confused youre angry why would i be angry
it was beautiful
he quickly turns away to lead the applause
on stage the pianist raises his hands to acknowledge the crowd
both his hands contain a perfectly formed extra finger
from an upstairs window we observe the investigators car cruise slowly back into the squalid housing project
a man is buckling his pants at the window
one of those hoovers is back
a prostitute valerie a slender sylphlike beauty joins him at the window
hes here to see me
her client looks at her askance
despite her assurances he hurries into his clothes anyway
to an unseen woman in the next room sonja i cant see anyone else tonight
the investigator sits up in the bed glass in his hand
valerie lies on the tangled sheets naked making no effort to cover herself
she regards the investigator curiously
i dont understand you investigator
the investigator glances idly in her direction
teasing good naturedly you hunt us by day and fuck us by night
do you only get it up for in valids
the investigator smiles and rejoins her on the bed
wouldnt you be happier with one of your made to order whores
gently stroking her hair you are so beautiful are you sure you werent altered
this is not the face the body of a godchild
how could something so lovely be a product of chance
is that what keeps you coming back
meeting his gaze look at you
such angry beautiful perfect eyes
do you ever wonder what they would see if they werent quite so perfect
they will never see what see
the investigator tries to laugh off her assertion but his tight lipped smile betrays his displeasure
a cruel edge to his voice you have so much wrong with you youll be lucky to see next year
he roughly forces himself on top of her but she remains defiant
are you so much more alive investigator
parting her legs im not paying you to talk
irene drives jerome at her side
cars are being flagged down by uniformed police officers
irene slows down behind the car in front
spying an officer shine a flashlight in the eyes of the male driver up ahead jerome wipes the contact lenses from his eyes and flicks them out of the passenger
window when irene is not looking
an officer approaches jerome and without a word opens an electronic testing kit worn on his hip
he removes a sterilized q tip and motions for jerome to open his mouth so he can scrape a culture
jerome waves his hand in front of his mouth feigning embarrassment
conspiratorial better not
nodding in irenes direction dont want to give you a contaminated specimen
if you get my meaning
irene plays along shrugging coyly at the cop
we see an extreme close up of jeromes hand as he furtively retrieves a hair follicle attached to his shirt cuff
with the hair already in his fingers he pretends to pluck a hair from his head faking a wince at the appropriate moment
the cop wearing transparent latex gloves takes the follicle and places it in a receptacle in his kit
after a short moment the hair confirms jeromes driving id which appears on the kits electronic screen
as the cop departs irene looks questioningly at jerome
answering her unasked question you never know where those swabs have been
irene nods however clearly not convinced
she shakes the doubt from her mind
i want to show you something
she accelerates away
we see the road ahead from jeromes pov
without his contact lenses it is a blur
after closing time suited detectives vacuum the club in which jerome and eugene dined the previous evening
michael the owner looks on disdainfully
waiting in the background the regular cleaners most likely in valids themselves smirk to each other enjoying watching the cops do their work for them
with no place to turn the car around irene parks on the cliff side of the six lane highway
in the darkness she dashes from the car and without a second thought runs directly out into the heavy commuter traffic
easily negotiating the on coming cars she emerges safely on the other side of the highway
jerome rounding the car from the passenger side is about to follow when he suddenly pulls up sharply at the curb
we focus on his eyes deprived of the benefit of their contact lenses
from jeromes pov we see that the headlights rushing towards him are nothing but a series of fast moving blurs blurs that merge together
he is unable to distinguish between the vehicles or judge their distance
calling back urgently from the other side mindful of the light beginning to leak into the sky come on
well miss it
irene stares expectantly back at jerome with her vision unaware of his predicament
jerome puts a foot off the curb at the wrong moment and is almost collected by an on coming car
irene is taken aback at his mistiming
does she detect a squint on jeromes face
to jerome the figure of irene on the other side of the highway is merely a featureless shape but he feels her expectation
he touches the spectacles still in his pocket but they are an unthinkable option
he shakes the idea from his head and turns back to the swiftly flowing highway
he makes up his mind he cannot allow himself to be shamed even at the risk of life and limb
hardly even glancing at the traffic he suddenly bolts blindly across the road
headlights hurtling towards him cars fortuitously brushing past his heels horns blaring
jerome makes a final leap to the haven of the far curb the rush of air from a large fast moving truck blowing him the final inches to the sidewalk
irene is stunned by the near miss
she is about to comment but jerome takes her by the arm and ushers her towards the dunes
well miss it
jerome and irene huddle beneath an overcoat as the sun crests the horizon staining the sky with an ochre blush
what did i tell you
however to his eyes the rising yolk is nothing but an out of focus abstract ink blot
i envy you jerome
youll be next
i dont think so
the only trip ill make in space is around the sun letting a handful of sand slip through her fingers on this satellite right here
irene turns to jerome
blurting out whats really on her mind listen i dont want to waste your time and i really dont want you to waste mine i dont know what youre after
but i have a feeling im not it
irene suddenly takes jeromes hand and puts it up her sweater onto her breast
although taken aback jerome makes no effort to withdraw his hand
enjoying his unease its here
adding quickly im careful weekly check ups
im on a drug maintenance program blood thinners diet slowly removing his hand i just want you to know what youd be getting yourself into
what exactly is wrong
ill start experiencing symptoms in my late fifties
matter of fact but unless they come up with something between now and then i wont live much past
jeromes mouth drops a little betraying his surprise at the statement from a woman plainly still in her twenties
of course i think about it every day
still not quite recovered from his surprise of course
the investigator swims his race with the unseen opponent
the investigators assistant carrying a phone tries to attract his attention
jerome sits at his own poolside in his robe feet dangling over the edge smoking a cigarette
eugene from his wheelchair is applying bleach to jeromes hair and eyebrows with gloved hands
at the same time jerome plays a sleight of hand game with a syringe
how was your evening
i couldnt stop her apologizing
teasing you are a catch
no doubt shes worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring
everybody wants to breed up
idly curious whats wrong with her
trying to be blase you know how it is with these altered births somebody told her shes not going to live forever and shes been preparing to die ever since
youre not thinking of telling her are you
of course not
but shes have to know eventually
adamant she doesnt have to know
she doesnt want to know
the camera travels down jeromes scarred legs to find that the pool is completely drained
we now realize that it never contained water
a desolate landscape resembling the surface of the planet mars
we pull back to find that we are peering at this forbidding desert through a circular aperture
the investigator lifts his head from the eyepiece of an electron microscope through which he has been examining a tiny fragment of skin the skin is identified as belonging to
year old vincent
detective hugo stands at the investigators side his attitude more respectful in light of the discovery
detective hugo points out a location on a computer generated map
chagrined the skin flake was found in michaels restaurant
the employees are all accounted for
does this michaels cater to misfits
shifting the view of the map to include the gattaca complex no
but one or two borrowed ladders have shown up there in the past
the investigator understands the significance
they wander over to a blow up photograph of the year old vincent
we have to consider the possibility that hes playing somebody elses hand
a smile gradually broadens across the investigators face
taking a perverse pleasure in the slowly dawning revelation of course
hes a de gene erate
glancing to a photo of the gattaca crime scene he works at gattaca
why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom
nobody stops to take a leak during a murder
quickly covering himself its still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor delivery man it could have blown in through an open window
the investigator appears not to be listening his mind made up
mind racing he was afraid of being exposed
thats why he did it
puzzled it is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers
youve seen their security system
they know who works there
referring to year old vincents profile even if you ignore the mans expiration date his profile suggests that he doesnt have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass
dont underestimate these imposters
skeptical referring to a file of gattaca employee id photos none of the id photos match the enhancement
smiling to himself a man can change his face but blood is forever
sample every employee within the parameters i gave you
hugos mouth drops open at the mention of intravenous
immediately protesting you know their workforce
two thirds at least fall into the category
well be closing down their operation for days
seeking a compromise at least go with a fingertip sample or urine
shaking his head blood
from the vein
the investigator turns on his heel to prevent further protest
the detective and his assistants exchange looks of exasperation behind the investigators back
jerome drinking water stands in front of a large video bulletin board
among other things it displays the electronic mugshot of year old vincent alongside the recent computer generated age enhancement of his face
some distance away caesar the elderly janitor discusses the mugshots with a younger janitor
look like anybody to you
not to me
ugly sonofabitch though isnt he
jerome half smiles realizing that the conversation is for his benefit
having made it clear that they do not intend to expose their former colleague the two janitors continue their rounds
jerome crushes his paper cup
forgetting himself he drops the cup into the wastebasket
jerome familiarizes himself with the interior of a spacecraft under the supervision of director josef and the mission commander
the screen that jerome sits at is identical to the one he operates in the computer complex displaying asteroid gaspra
somewhere in the dust of gaspra is the key
warming to his theme back to the beginning of the book the life we became
with the original building blocks who knows how far we can take the godding
wry smile even someone as advanced as jerome will be last years model by the time were done
smiling back i wouldnt get your hopes up commander
irene enters the craft
excuse me mr morrow
the investigators have begun their testing
this is so inconvenient irene
they can make an exception for jerome
im afraid not
i apologize jerome
its not yor fault director
afterthought if your predecessor were still around we may not be going to gaspra at all
thats what would call inconvenient
jerome exits the craft with irene
a line of male gattaca employees snakes out the door and down the corridor
the investigator walks slowly down the line trying to eyeball his suspect
concentrating on the shorter dark haired men in the line he looks straight past jerome
however as the investigator ignores him and walks by we see a haunted look in jeromes eyes
every available technician is working to accommodate the testing of the thousand or so programmers
twelve testing stations operate simultaneously
a homicide detective supervises each station
jerome reaches the head of the line
he notes an exiting colleague holding a cotton ball to his arm
a nurse directs jerome to lamars testing station
lamar deposits the previous patients labeled vial into a blood carousel under the watchful eye of a large detective clearly not relishing his assignment
jerome rolls up his sleeve
referring to the table lined with syringes whats with the plungers lamar
what are you doing opening a blood bank
the syringes are clearly not lamars idea
sarcastic the gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods may have been compromised
lamar inserts a fresh syringe into jeromes arm
as lamar draws the blood jerome suddenly flinches and flexes his arm violently causing the needle to bend and buckle exiting the skin from a second puncture point
having pulled away from lamars grasp jerome withdraws the bent needle himself blood still squirting from his vein
grabbing a nearby wad of gauze jesus im sorry jerome
the large homicide detective winces and turns away from the red arcing spray a splash of blood spattering his shoes
in the midst of the commotion with his practised sleight of hand jerome removes the vial from the syringe and replaces it with another concealed vial
unfazed putting lamar at his ease you must be out of practise lamar
lamar hurriedly takes the syringe from jerome
examining and removing the switched vial from the bent syringe ive got enough here
regarding the squimish detective as he holds the gauze to his arm need any more you can always get it off his shoes
the detective notices the spatter of blood across his brogues and with a look of disdain wipes it clean
he tosses the incriminating tissue down a hygenically sealed garbage shoot
lamar places jeromes labelled vial in the carousel where it is immediately analyzed by the computer
jeromes legitimate employee id code appears on the screen another employee enters the testing lab
jerome exits the testing lab with the gauze held to his arm
irene is standing outside the door
so you didnt do it after all
joking darkly i guess somebody beat me to it
from above the investigator and hugo observe the final employee exit the testing lab
lamar following the employee out of the lab throws a look of vindication to the two cops
thats the last
somethings not right
losing his patience hes not here
its a blind alley
resolute no weve missed something
we hoover again
we dont have the manpower
from outside if you have to
from what budget
angered by hugos excuses ill take it out of your damn pension if you question my authority one more time
the investigator turns his back on his subordinate and idly contemplates the nearby telescope
hugo resignedly relays the news to director josef who is standing some distance away
josefs immediate reaction is to march towards the investigator hugo trailing behind
director josef collects himself as he notices the investigators hand on the telescope
would you care to look in the telescope
thank you no
still referring to the telescope one look through there and you would know why i cant possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further
unfazed youre so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst
right now your presence is creating more of a threat
i dont think you have any concept of what we do here how meticulous our preparations must be
we are about to send twelve people through million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal
so its rather critical to point them in the right direction
and we certainly dont need you looking over our shoulders
besides i dont believe there is any evidence that the killer is amongst us
i dont see too many other dead bodies littering the place
surveying the mostly empty facility no but since there arent too many live ones tonight either you wont mind us conducting one further sweep
if he does not work here then there should be no other trace of him
to hugo i think youd better get some people out of bed detective
a thought occurs in the meantime we can re check his favorite haunt
director josef quietly seethes
to josef referring to the telescope you see director i prefer my microscope
jerome readies himself for an evening out a bandage around his arm from the needle puncture
eugene wheels himself in
where are we going
slightly guilty im sorry
ive got plans
feigning hurt again
referring to his bandage shes already got her doubts
i have to act like nothings wrong
im sure youll be very convincing
jerome ignores the remark
where are you taking her
eugene looks at him askance
everybody goes there
incredulous glancing around the room you may as well invite her here
afterthought as he picks up his jacket will you be okay
dont worry about your little pin cushion
to be honest im looking forward to having the place to myself
seeing through the bravado well still be able to talk when im away
the conversation will just keep getting longer
by the time im at the belt you phone and say how are you
forty five minutes later i reply not bad
how are you
i guess id better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer
irene and jerome step off the dance floor of the smoky decadent dinner club and take a seat at their table
irene is agog at the strange assortment of patrons the cigars the laden dessert trolleys
it is all slightly off from the pristine world she is accustomed to
what is this place
wry smile enjoying her fascination youve never been here
a dessert trolley is wheeled up let me order for you
jerome selects a chocolate torte from the trolley
jerome savors a spoonful
irene is tempted but then remembers herself
id better not
she reaches for her elegant pill box
jerome takes another spoonful
so sure of what you cant do
do you even know what it tastes like irene
irene goes to deny it but cannot
michael suddenly approaches the table with a waiter in tow
irene is about to steal a taste of the dessert with her finger when their plates and glasses are whisked away and the table immediately hoovered
michael whispers in jeromes ear
take the side door
jerome looks up in time to see detective hugo coming through the front entrance with several other detectives
to his colleagues check for lenses hairpieces a detective shines a flashlight in the eyes of a male patron
a second detective tugs the hair of a second patron
jerome takes irene by the hand and escorts her out of the side exit
several other couples make for the parking lot
why are we leaving
attempting to explain the hasty exit those checks take forever
spilling out of the exit jerome and irene find a burly plain clothes detective barring their way
before the detective can say a word jerome has wrapped his fist in his jacket sleeve and smashed him in the face
he continues to beat the detective until he lies motionless on the ground
spying other detectives some distance away in the parking lot
jerome leads irene out of a hidden side gate
what about the car
grabbing her by the hand lets walk
who are they
holding his bruised knuckles its not safe
i shouldnt have brought you here
jerome drags irene across a vast desolate lot lit only by moonlight
feeling exposed he breaks into a run
anxious come on
i left it back there
well get it later
forcing her to look him in the eye irene please
irene realizes his seriousness
she begins to run with him
the clearing is wider than jerome anticipated
they are only halfway across extremely vulnerable if the detective think yo look in their direction
the investigator is grilling michael the clubs owner
the investigator suspiciously regards the multitude of mini vacs in the kitchen and the incinerator burning the refuse
an accusing tone you run a clean establishment
are you a health inspector
showing vincents mugshot do you recognize this man
my eyes arent so good
hugo calls out from the side door where he has discovered his fallen colleague
the investigator hurries to him
to the still dazed detective examining his injuries did he hit you with his fist
head in his hands more like a hammer
reprimanding the beaten detective dont touch your face
to hugo quick clean his teeth
hugo uses a flashlight and a small dental like implement to try to pick skin from jeromes knuckles from between the detectives teeth
the investigator finds the hidden side door
jerome and irene continue to sprint across the enormous vacant lot in the moonlight splashing through deposits of mud and water
just as the gate opens in the distance jerome hurls irene into the safety of the undergrowth on the other side
irene out of breath desperately feels for her pulse
upset a strangled protest are you trying to kill me
dont you understand i cant do that
jerome tenderly removes irenes hand from her pulse
you just did
irene looks back across the vast clearing they have just negotiated realizing what she has just done
from across the other side of the clearing comes an echoing cry from the center figure
the investigator is about to cry out vincents name once again when he realizes detective hugo and the other detectives are watching him askance
to hugo covering his frustration what are you waiting for
where do we start
well vacuum these streets if we have to
handing the investigator irenes pill box we caught them trying to flush these sir
the investigator carefully examines the heart pills
jerome walks irene to the steps of her apartment
jerome thinks about departing but irene takes him gently by the hand
so sure of what you cant do
jerome follows her inside
jerome and irene climb a staircase to her bedroom
without another word they begin to make love
later that night jerome cannot sleep
he rises quietly so as not to disturb irene
he silently opens the double windows of the upstairs bedroom
he carefully gathers his pillow from the bed and shakes it out of the window
slowly jerome turns to gaze at the wood floor
in the moonlight we see an extreme close up of a single hair lying on the floorboards
jerome bends and picks up the hair trying to identify it in the dim light
on his hands and knees he tries to clean the floor with a towel
irene turns over in the bed
jerome freezes but she continues to sleep
he realizes he may be spreading even more of his skin and hair over the floor
overcome with frustration and the enormity of his task he begins to quietly weep
a light shroud of mist hangs over the trees that encircle a grassy clearing beyond irenes building
something lies in the center of the clearing
we jump cut to an extreme close up of two or three blades of grass
bristles rain down on the blades
withotu access to his incinerator the crouched naked figure of jerome disposes of his whiskers skin and hair in an open field
his clothes sit in a neat pile at his side
he pours glycolic acid over his body and scrubs at his back feet and hands with a brush
there is a haunted tortured look in his eyes as he tries desperately to rid himself of himself
the investigator swims obsessively in his aquatic treadmill
back in the bedroom jerome partially dressed holds irene in bed
she softly touches the scars on his shins
referring to the shins what happened
you remember the chrysler lebaron
its the exact height of the front fender
shrugs looked right instead of left
comforted by the thought so youre not so smart after all
awkward about raising the subject i want you to know if it ever came to it id be willing to get an ovum from the egg bank
in fact id rather use a donor egg quickly covering herself again if it came to it
but if it came to it then it couldnt have your searching for an appropriate body part nose
stroking her face how perfect does your child have to be
mildly irritated by what she perceives as his mocking you hypocrite
do you think for one moment youd be doing what youre doing if it wasnt for who you are what you are
dont you get any satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish
thats precisely what scares me that they wont do anything foolish or courageous or anything worth a goddamn
irene is taken aback by jeromes passion regarding him in a new light
eugene urinates into a large plastic container while drinking bottled water at the same time
he already has several other containers of urine on the table beside him
the investigator and detective hugo keep a wary eye on the outfitted detectives re vacuuming the empty computer complex with their mini vacs
reading newspaper my wife and i were thinking of starting a family
shrugs ambivalent why not
these new personality corrections ive been reading about
you worried about the cost
regarding hugo with a condescending smile they said the same thing about myopia and obesity
you think your children would be less human if they were less violent angry spiteful
maybe theyd be more human
from where i sit the world could stand a little improving
we dwell on one detective in particular snatching a garbage bag from caesar the janitor
dont touch that
he puts a pile of discarded paper cups aside for later testing
in the vast empty gattaca complex the investigator inspects a specimen bag containing jeromes paper cup with director josef and detective hugo
positive saliva match
the cup was definitely used since the original sweep
so we have two choices
either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and i dont know anybody that thirsty or
looking out over the empty complex he is here
resolute we test again
youre right hugo this was a desperate act
someone had a lot to lose that night perhaps their place in line
to director josef id like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission
nervous twelve have a mission within the week
this time i will supervise each test personally
jerome and irene walk towards the entrance to gattaca
spying the homicide investigation trucks parked at the rear of the building and the silhouette of the investigator in the doorway jerome pulls up sharply
irene notices his unease
what is it
i forgot something something at home
ill see you later
jerome kisses her
irene also aware of the trucks interrogates jerome with her eyes
ill miss you
jerome is still focussed on the entranceway
looking skywards when you go away
we could go together one day
irene considers the idea
she enters gattaca alone
irene prepares a stack of id photos of crew members for the investigator
she closely inspects the doctored photo of jerome hesitating before adding it to the file
the camera dwells on jeromes vacant work station
the investigator curiously regards the empty chair
he is accompanied by detective hugo director josef and irene
hes the only absentee
a little nausea
at least its nothing contagious
unduly agitated i will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission
were already counting backwards
the investigator ignores josef and takes a pocket knife from his jacket
he prises out the esc key from jeromes keyboard places the key in a specimen bag and deposits it in his jacket
picking up a phone ill call and let him know
the investigator gently but firmly removes the phone from irenes hand and replaces the receiver in the cradle
lets not spoil the surprise
to irene i understand you can show us the way
the anxious director josef calls out to protest one further time but the investigator is on his way out of the door
outside the entrance to gattaca trying to hail a taxi jerome is startled to see a car carrying the investigator detective hugo and irene roar out of the driveway
jerome calls on his portable wristphone
eugene at his window filling sachets as usual hesitates before answering the phone
how would you like to be yourself for the day
nonchalant i was never very good at it remember
with a look of resolve eugene hangs up the phone
he wheels his chair up to the sweeping staircase and regards the first of many dozen steps
the daunting staircase spirals away above him
the investigator looks to irene in the rear seat
taunting you dont know who he is do you irene
he hands her the pill box found in michaels
you think you have problems
having wheeled his chair out of sight eugene eases himself out of his wheelchair and onto the floor
using his elbows commando style dragging his lifeless legs behind him he proceeds to crawl across the floor and up the first step of the long spiral staircase
we observe his agonizingly slow progress up a staircase that from eugenes point of view appears to have doubled in length
the investigator and detective hugo emerge from their car with irene in tow
they take in the impressive complex the investigator gets a glimpse of the empty pool
they approach the intercom at the entrance
eugene bathed in sweat finally crests the landing of the staircase
as he drags himself across the floor the internal phone rings
he frantically stretches up and knocks the phone off its hook so he can talk from his prone position on the floor
irene is on the phone closely watched by the investigator and through intercom no trace of his distress hello
a moments hesitation jerome
come on up
with no mean effort eugene finally manages to replace the phone on its cradle
he desperately crawls up onto the sofa
however spying the upright vacuum cleaner in the open closet he is forced to crawl there and remove the vacuum bag
he frantically crawls back towards the sofa and stuffs the bag behind a cushion
irene enters the door deliberately left ajar closely followed by the investigator and detective hugo
eugene is propped up on the sofa tv remote control placed in his useless hand to cover his paralysis
he has a stainless steel bowl next to him and has crossed his lifeless legs for a more natural effect
eugene calmy motions the confused irene towards him
wheres my kiss
the investigator scrutinizes irenes reaction
with only the merest hesitation she takes her cue from eugene and kisses him affectionately on the forehead
she perches herself on the arm of the sofa
eugene takes the opportunity to rest his arm on her leg
good to see youre feeling better
now youre here
who are your friends
its about the director
feigning boredom again
the investigator slowly circles eugene regarding him with the utmost scrutiny
he compares his face to the doctored gattaca id photo a passable likeness
eugene bends towards the bowl and dry retches
forgive me for not getting up
irene puts a comforting hand on eugenes shoulder
to the investigator couldnt we do this another time
i dont believe so
detective hugo takes a seat in the chair beside the sofa and unpacks a syringe from the kit he carries
this wont take a moment
detective hugo swabs eugenes inner arm
all eyes are trained on the tip of the needle as it punctures the vein
reassuring to irene referring to the blood flowing into the syringe its okay
maybe they can find out what ive got
under the investigators watchful eye detective hugo withdraws the syringe and immediately inserts a small amount of the blood into the portable analyzer he wears
naturally it confirms that eugene is jerome
irene does her best to conceal her shock
hiding his frustration the investigator distractedly tours the room while hugo packs up his gear
the investigator idly toys with the telescope pointed out of the window
next he wanders towards the closet and reaches for the doorknob
mind if i take a leak
as long as you dont do it in my closet
nodding to the other side of the room over there
the investigator immediately pulls a specimen bag from his jacket pocket and closely inspects the stainless steel toilet and sink
they are both spotless
the shower stall is also scrupulously clean
he flushes the toilet and exits
lost in thought the investigator approaches the closet again and wheels out jeromes upright vacuum cleaner
he is disappointed a second time to find no vacuum bag inside
the investigator returns the vacuum cleaner to the closet and produces a mini vac from detective hugos crime bag
to eugene referring to ther mini vac may i
clean the whole house if you want
taking eugenes lead actually the kitchen needs doing
the investigator switches on the mini vac to take a specimen from the floor then promptly kills the machine
looking down the investigator notices the trail of eugenes perspiration on the highly polished floor leading to the spiral staircase
eugene reading the investigators mind goes to call out but the words remain frozen on his tongue
hugo follows his superior as they start to descend the stairs
irene and eugene are left staring at one another
jerome catches the merest glimpse of the investigator and detective hugo before he slips behind a doorway in eugenes condominium
jerome anxiously regards eugenes empty wheelchair sitting there
on the stairs hugos phone rings
into phone increasingly encouraged yes
yes the investigator is already at the foot of the stairs in eugenes condo when the detective calls to him
urgent to investigator come quickly
we have him
the investigators eyes light up
he retraces his steps up the staircase after detective hugo
jerome white as a ghost climbs the stairs emerging into his own condominium
he embraces the beaming eugene still sitting on the sofa
numb how are you jerome
not bad jerome
how the hell did you get here
deadpan i could always walk
ive been faking it
jerome almost laughs despite the situation
only now does he notice irene on the other side of the room her mind racing
she looks at jerome and eugene together and runs from the apartment
calling after her irene
jerome goes to follow but eugene stops him
an extreme close up of dried blood brittle and cracking on a pair of soiled latex gloves
a latex head mask suit of clothes and shoe covers are similarly caked
the investigator and detective hugo watch as a white coated forensic technician feeds a minute sample of the dried blood into an analyzer
the investigator wanders over to a one way glass window through which he can observe director josef sitting numb but strangely serene in an interrogation room
the investigator in a state of shock himself cannot yet bring himself to believe what is plainly obvious
gazing at the director struggling to come to grips with the turn of events this cant be him
the detective regards his superior incredulously intrigued that he could still cling so stubbornly to his theory in the face of such overwhelming evidence
intrigued we found his spit in the dead directors eye
hes signed a confession supplied us with the suit he wore on the night
what more do you want
a trace of desperation grasping at straws luca could still be an accomplice
the investigator turns away unwilling or unable to accept the explanation
hugo regards the investigator with a trace of sympathy
he furtively retrieves the investigators tissue from the trash
jerome sits in a formal briefing room with the other crew members of his mission receiving their final pre flight instructions
lamar looks on approvingly
finally id like to welcome navigator morrow on his debut mission if we get lost out there nobody has a map of the heavens in his head like jerome
jerome looks up bashfully
adopting a more serious tone im gratified that there is no longer a cloud hanging over tomorrows launch
now we can put this unpleasantness behind us and concentrate on the task at hand
i dont have to tell you how important this mission is the belt could hold the key to the origin of life why we are what we are
injecting a note of levity i know many of you have been asking that question about me for long enough
referring to a projected photograph of a misshapen asteroid behind his head gaspra how could something so ugly hold so many beautiful secrets
polite smiles from his colleagues
enjoy your final evening with your families
well all be a year older when they see us next
and dont be late tomorrow
you dont want to miss this
we focus on jerome
he appears to have his head in the heavens already
the tormented investigator lies on the floor of his lab staring at the ceiling
he winces in discomfort
he is lying on something
he rolls over and retrieves the irritation from his pocket
it is the esc computer key he prized from jeromes keyboard
he gazes at the key for a moment and then gets to his feet
he resurrects an old fingerprint kit from a cupboard
carefully removing the key from the specimen bag marked morrow jerome he begins to dust it for a fingerprint
he places the key under a camera
the enlarged print appears on the lefthand side of his computer screen
the word match blinks onto the screen
however the face that appears from the computers databank is not that of morrow jerome but luca vincent
the investigator regards the photograph in disbelief
detective hugo casually enters the lab something odd in his nonchalant demeanor
ive found him
ive found him too
not listening referring to his discovery a fingerprint
theres something to be said for nostalgia
realizing what hugo has said what did you find
hugo puts a specimen bag on the counter
it contains the investigators discarded tissue
the investigator does not recognize it
its not exactly him
interest piqued where did you get this
the investigator immediately deposits the tissue into an analyzer
referring to the tissue but this man does share some common characteristics with your suspect
not so many but enough it appears the eyelash has a brother of a kind
the investigator realizes the significance and looks guiltily to hugo
hugo exits the lab leaving the investigator to stare at his own face in his analyzing machine
caesar the old janitor enters the locker room
he is about to wearily open his locker when he senses another presence in the room
he turns to find jerome sitting there on a bench
although clearly delighted caesar tries to disguise his pleasure
so youve finally seen sense and come back to your old job vincent
not yet im afraid
whats keeping you
i guess im a slow learner
i guess so
looking up through the small window well while youre up there maybe you could tidy the place up a bit
ill see what i can do
the two men embrace caesar breaking off before jerome
and dont go getting everybody lost out there
youll give us a bad name
you wont have me to keep an eye on you you know
glancing to caesars locker by the way i left some trash in your locker
happy to oblige ill take care of it
caesar watches him go and turns back to his locker
he opens it to find a brand new high tech telescope sitting inside
the old janitor gets over his surprise and beams broadly he looks back in jeromes direction but he has gone
the old janitor cannot help himself and reverently reaches for the telescopes eyepiece
in the dimly lit empty computer complex jerome takes a last look around
he sits at his computer one final time replaying the graphic representation of his path through the cosmos that he is on the eve of taking for real
he notices the key missing from his keyboard
instantly realizing the significance he rises from his seat to flee
vincent jerome is stopped in his tracks by the sound of his given name and the voice that calls it
he makes no further attempt to flee but turns to face his pursuer
the investigator steps out of the shadows
vincent what are you running from
disturbingly calm from vincent
the two men face each other for the first time in a long time
the investigator is transfixed by jeromes face scarcely able to believe his eyes
has it been so long you dont remember who i am
nodding to the investigators badge maybe its you whos forgotten
meeting his gaze what are you doing here anton
it is finally apparent the investigator is jeromes younger brother anton as we shall refer to the investigator for the i could ask you the same question
glancing to the impressive complex i have a right to be here you dont
jerome smiles at him condescendingly
you almost sound like you believe that
ignoring the remark extending his hand come with me now vincent
youve gone as far as you can go
refusing antons hand glancing to the telescope above them there are a few million miles to go yet
adamant its over
shaking his head is that the only way you can succeed anton to see me fail
its for the best
increasingly angered god even you want to tell me what i cant do
in case you hadnt noticed anton i dont need rescuing
but you did once
anton is clearly stung by the memory
you have all the answers
how is that possible
resolute you didnt beat me that day
i beat myself who are you trying to convince
angry i will prove it to you
come swim with me now vincent
jerome regards anton with a knowing smile
somewhere in gattaca a phone rings
irene sitting in her car outside jeromes condominium hangs up her portable phone
in her agitation her finger involuntarily goes to her pulse
she catches herself and removes the finger from her wrist as if it has burned her
she exits the car
irene quietly knocks on jeromes door but there is no response
trying the handle the door opens
her curiosity takes her inside
all is quiet
irene calls out
irene hesitantly ventures further drawn to the spiral staircase
she tentatively makes her way down the stairs and into eugenes dimly lit condominium
with wonder and reverence she examines the instruments and samples laid out on eugenes work benches
she opens the refrigerator in the bathroom and inspects the samples and sachets
finally she regards the empty incinerator
quite something isnt it
eugene has entered through the mirrored door not at all displeased by her unexpected visit
referring to the incinerator thats where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded
ive been looking for him
do you know where he is
unconcerned hes probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes
eugene idly inspects one of the blood sachets
dont be deceived irene
these are just the clothes
he has to wear them
something i could never do
whats wrong with him
sympathetic smile you have more in common than you know
irenes hand involuntarily goes to her heart
but they say his is already ten thousand beats overdue
i have my doubts
wry smile for all my gifts they could never engineer me a heart like vincents
irene turns back to the incinerator lost in though
jerome and anton walk down a dune together towards the beach not far from gattaca an ocean beach pounded by an angry black sea
jerome picks up a sharp piece of shell and slices the end of his thumb
a drop of blood oozes out
he offers the shell to anton but anton does not take it
both men begin to disrobe
the brothers stand beside each other on the sand once again anton still the more athletically built of the two
together they enter the raging surf
diving through the breaking waves they begin to swim
in the moonlit night we watch their two bodies swimming side by side
they swim a long distance anton waiting for his brother to tire
but the pace does not slacken
anton pulls up in the water
sensing his brother is no longer beside him jerome also pulls up
they tread water several yards apart
attempting to conceal his distress how are you doing this vincent
how have you done any of this
now is your chance to find out
jerome swims away a second time
anton is forced to follow once again
angry now gritting his teeth anton calls upon the same determination we have witnessed during his constant swimming in the pool
he puts on a spurt slowly reeling in jerome
anton gradually draws alongside jerome certain that this effort will demoralize his older brother
but jerome has been foxing waiting for him to catch up
jerome smiles at anton
with almost a trace of sympathy he forges ahead again
anton is forced to go with him
they swim again for a long distance
it is anton who gradually becomes demoralized his strokes weaken his will draining away
anton pulls up exhausted and fearful
jerome also pulls up
however his face displays none of antons anxiety
they tread water several yards apart
the ocean is choppier now
the view of the lights on the shore is obscured by the peaks of the waves
panic starting to show vincent wheres the shore
were too far out
we have to go back
calling back too late for that
were closer to the other side
anton looks towards the empty horizon
what other side
how far do you want to go
do you want to drown us both
becoming hysterical how are we going to get back
jerome merely smiles back at his younger brother a disturbingly serene smile
eerily calm you wanted to know how i did it
thats how i did it anton
i never saved anything for the swim back
anton stares at jerome aghast
the two men face each other in silence treading water several yards apart in the dark rolling ocean
jerome turns and heads back towards the shore
anton is left alone with the terrifying realization
the only sound the wind and the water
jerome dishevelled and distressed arrives back at the condominium
he notices irene standing at the edge of the pool
he approaches her
they stand several yards apart
looking into each others eyes they do not speak
jerome abruptly pulls a hair from his head for once one of his own
wry smile offering the hair to irene here take it
irene takes the hair the significance not lost on her
echoing irenes words from their first encounter if youre still interested let me know
irene contemplates the hair in her fingers for a moment then deliberately lets it fall to the ground
never taking her eyes from him echoing jeromes words from their first encounter sorry the wind caught it
once again there is not a breath of wind
the hair lies plainly visible on the edge of the pool
from an upstairs window eugene observes the couple
we watch the silhouette of irene and jerome making love in the bedroom
eugene sitting in his darkened room unscrews the cap of a plastic container and places it on a nearby table
we remain on eugenes face as he opens his fly
irene and jerome lie in bed together after making love
for once jerome is able to sleep unconcerned
it is irene who lies awake head against jeromes chest listening to the sound of his erratically beating heart
however it has a soothing effect on her
she kisses jerome and reluctantly rises from the bed
awakening a year is a long time
not so long just once around the sun
for once irene seems to be looking forward to the trip
she exits the room
inside the incinerator jerome scrapes away at himself for the final time
he wistfully regards the brush in his hand
jerome dressed for his departure emerges down the spiral staircase into eugenes condo
jerome notices several suitcases at the foot of the stairs
eugene wheels into the room
i have your samples ready
confused have you forgotten
i dont need any samples where im going
meeting jeromes gaze no but you might need them when you get back
eugene wheels across the room and opens the mirrored door
the water vapor billows out
jerome regards eugene
eugene leads jerome inside for the first time
inside are two rows of four identical industrial refrigerators
they contain thousands of blood and urine specimens
jerome regards them with awe and more than a little unease
everything you need to last you two lifetimes
eugene points out an extra specimen of semen in the first refrigerator
theres an extra specimen
i wish i could give it to her myself
afterthought but then you always were better at being me
eugene leads the way out of the refrigerator room
struggling to come to terms with the discovery why have you done this
as he seals the mirrored door in case you get back before i do
where are you going
glancing to the suitcases im travelling too
jerome goes to question eugenes travel plans but thinks better of it
he kneels before his friend and embraces him
i got the better end of the deal
i just lent you my body you lent me your dream
jerome smiles and hugs eugene a final time
eugene stuffs an envelope into jeromes pocket
referring to the note glancing heavenwards not until youre upstairs
eugene watches him go
jerome enters a large holding area along with his other eleven jeromes heart sinks as he recognizes lamar greeting the crew for one final unexpected substance test
his colleagues groan good naturedly but it is clearly far more than an inconvenience to jerome
he looks towards the door he has just entered but there is no way back
one by one the crew are ushered behind a screen
before he can think of a way out it is jeromes turn
he enters the cubicle
as he takes the plastic cup from lamar whats this lamar
from behind we see jerome unzip his fly
however for once jerome does not urinate on cue unused to operating his own equipment in front of the physician
intrigued by the out of character discharge flight got you nervous
theres a problem lamar
apparently not listening did i ever tell you about my son jerome
hes a big fan of yours
he wants to apply here
jerome realizes he has no choice
resigned to his fate he begins to fill the cup
as he urinates just remember lamar i could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser cutting him off unfortunately my sons not all that they
but then who know what he could do
lamar takes the cup from jerome in his gloved hand
jerome anxiously watches his sample poured into the analyzer
confirming jeromes worst fears the face of year old vincent appears on the computer screen
however lamar does not look at the screen
he stares jerome in the eye
for future reference a brief glance to where jerome has just zipped his fly righthanded men dont hold it with their left
its just one of those things
never lookig at the screen lamar presses a button marked knowing smile have a safe trip vincent
jerome exits up a long enclosed escalator realizing that lamar has known all along
eugene knocks back a vodka
with a certain reverence he places his silver medal around his neck
at the top of a long escalator the door to a craft is secured
eugenes wheelchair empty sits beside the door of the incinerator also secured
a close up of the flame of a rockets engines igniting the ball of fire engulfs the launchpad filling the screen
inside the incinerator another ball of fire this time engulfing the unseen figure of eugene
we glimpse the medal around his neck melting in the fierce blaze
as we have seen so often in the past a rocket launches into the sky over gattaca however on this occasion it carries jerome
we focus on jeromes face seeing little if any of the craft
jeromes eyes are closed
his head is still alarmingly still
could the launch itself have been too much for him
he hear the thoguhts in his head
we came from the stars so they say now its time to go back
if i was conceived today i would not get beyond eight cells and yet here i am
in a way they were right i dont have the heart for this world
pause the question is why am i having so much trouble dying
jeromes eyes blink open
he holds the letter from eugene in his hand
it contains no words merely a lock of eugenes hair for once preserved solely for its sentimental value
the hair weightless floats off the page
we focus on a porthole looking out upon a starscape
as we pan across the constellations a title is superimposed upon the starscape in a few short years scientists will have completed the human genome project the mapping of all
the genes that make up a human being
after billion years of evolution by the slow and clumsy method of natural selection we have now evolved to the point where we can direct our own evolution
the first title is replaced in the heavens by a second title
if only we had aquired this knowledge sooner the following people would never have been born a succession of portraits and photographs of renowned and historic figures fades in and
out of the constellations the accompanying titles list their affliction rather than their accomplishments
blind from birth epileptic arthritic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis lou gerhigs disease alzheimers disease blind and deaf lou gerhigs disease asthmatic chronic invalid the face of charles darwin fades off and
another title appears out of the stars
even charles darwin the man who told of the survival of the fittest numbered amongst our frailest
the title fades off and is replaced by one final title in the night sky
of course the other birth that would surely never have taken place is your own
