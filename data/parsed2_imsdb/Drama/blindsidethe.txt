written by john lee hancock based on the book the blind side evolution of a game by michael lewis a distinctly southern voice
theres a moment of orderly silence before a football play begins
players are in position linemen are frozen and anythings possible
then like a traffic accident stuff begins to randomly collide
from the snap of the ball to the snap of the first bone is closer to four seconds than five
were watching footage of the redskins giants monday night football game
lots of angles faces knuckles as the two teams line up redskins on offense for the snap of the ball
as the play begins one mississippi
joe theismann the redskins quarterback takes the snap and hands off to his running back
joe theismann hands off to john riggins who takes two steps forward then turns and tosses the ball backto theismann
the footage pauses and plays like a coach breaking down film
its a trick play a flea flicker and the running back tosses the ball back to the quarterback
harry carson the giants linebacker sees that theismann has the ball back and races toward him
theismann steps up and to the side and carson flies past
up to now the plays been defined by what the quarterback sees
its about to be defined by what he doesnt
lawrence taylor carves a wide circle around the redskins lineman trying to block him
the blocker dives frantically
at taylors ankles and misses
taylor leaps arms raised filling the sky behind theismann
the image freezes
lawrence taylor is the best defensive player in the nfl and has been from the time he stepped onto the field as a rookie
the frozen image of taylor comes to life as he jackknifes theismanns body
players faces react to what theyre seeing
taylor pops up from the pile and jumps around like a madman
he will also change the game of football as we know it
we are watching the mnf feed and hear the announcers voices
again well look at it with the reverse angle one more time
and i suggest if your stomach is weak you just dont watch
joe theissman never played another down of football
now yall would guess that more often than not the highest paid player on an nfl team is the quarterback
the camera finds matt hasselbeck seattles quarterback
and youd be right
what you probably dont know is that more often than not the second highest paid player is thanks to lawrence taylor a left tackle
the camera goes to walter jones seattles left tackle
because as every housewife knows the first check you write is for the mortgage and the second is for the insurance
the left tackles job is to protect the quarterback from what he cant see coming
to protect his blind side
famous left tackles jonathan ogden orlando pace andre gurode
then we see shots of their hands feet waists etc
corresponding with the ideal left tackle is big but a lot of people are big
he is wide in the butt and massive in the thighs
he has long arms giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup
a street anchored by project housing and littered with broken down cars and neer do wells
lots of folks out milling about but our focus is on a teenager in the distance moving toward us in slo mo while everyone else is at normal speed
hes extremely large six and a half feet but he carefully steps instead of strutting
his name is michael oher
this is a rare and expensive combination the need for which can be traced to that monday night game and lawrence
for on that day he not only altered joe theismanns life but mine as well
as michael continues toward us he begins to go out of focus mr
oher do you know why im here
do you know do you understand why im here
im here to investigate your odd
looks like a government office
not much more than a desk on either side of which sit investigator granger an african american woman in a business suit and michael oher
michael slumps a bit eyes the ground and rubs his hands on his knees a nervous trait of his
do you find it odd
iono i dont know
investigator granger sifts through her briefcase pulls out files documents a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble michael is in
she sits back stares at michael as if trying to figure him out
michael cant meet her gaze
he looks out the window rubs his knees some more
can i leave now
michael sits in the back seat behind steven hamilton and his father big tony who drives
not a word is spoken as they drive through the streets of west memphis poverty ridden
the taurus exits into the taurus passes an endless supply of churches and strip joints all of which michaels eyes take in
weve gone from slums to nice neighborhoods fathers and sons play baseball kids tend lemonade stands sprinklers keep the grass emerald green
michaels face tells us hes never seen anything like this
the taurus enters the parking lot filled with nice cars
big tony strides down the almost empty hallway spots a door
bert cotton football coach cleans off his desk ready to leave for the day
big tony knocks at the door
they say you the coach
cotton eyes tony offers a hand
tony hamilton but everybody call me big tony
what can i do for you tony
steven and michael eye the freshly painted buildings the flowers the new playground jungle gyms and outdoor hoops
sure is pretty huh big mike
mike doesnt answer just takes it all in
steven sees and opens a container filled to the brim with balls footballs basketballs four square balls
not even locked
white people are crazy
big tony and cotton are mid discussion you see i promised my mama boo on her deathbed that i would get steven outta public and into a church school
i appreciate that but im not involved with admissions
i figured id come to you seeing as you might need some players
what sport does he play
anything with a ball
he has cottons attention for a moment then it passes
classes start in a week
itd have to be for next semester
i know what youre thinking coach but i got money
im a mechanic at wilsons auto tother side of town
what if someone drops out or moves
could they get in then
you only mentioned one son
steven yessir but i brought another boy along
yeah big mike
he stays on our couch sometimes
its a bad deal
his mamas on the crack pipe and he aint got nobody
he just wanted to come along with us today
big mike be an applicant as well
yeah sure why not
cotton sighs considers what to do
theyd have to fill out applications and make an appointment for interviews
i was hopin you might just interview em now
big tony points out the
window to the playground where steven and michael are playing one on one basketball
the little ones steven and the big big mike
for a boy his size michael can really move
he dribbles fakes left then falls away making a long three pointer
cottons eyes get a little wider as he watches michael dribbles the ball between his legs behind his back and jumps high slamming the ball through the hoop
big men arent supposed to move like this
cottons lips are almost quivering mother of god
the board of admissions eight or so men and women are seated around a large conference table
by himself at one end sits bert cotton
are there spots available or not
paul sandstrom principal taps his fingers before
technically yes in both grades
but we have a greater responsibility than just filling classrooms
steven hamiltons paperwork looks acceptable and i believe he would be capable of succeeding here but the other kid sandstrom looks through papers for the name
michael oher gives us no reason to believe based on his record that he would be successful here
how bad could it be
another board member mrs
smith pores over michaels file which is a mess
she finds facts and lays them out were not sure exactly how old he is due to lack of records
he has a measured iq of
thats th percentile
hes been enrolled in seven different institutions including a gap of eighteen months around the age of ten when he apparently didnt attend school at all
he repeated first grade as well as second theres no record of attendance in third and in fourth grade so they moved him ahead without going to third grade
that says something
his attendance records are abysmal and his grade point average begins with a zero
zero point six silence around the room
boswell a board member and science teacher looks to the others
everyone passed him along gave him ds so they could hand their problem off to the next school
off their confusion for wanting to come here
for wanting a quality education
an education denied him by the poor quality of the schools hes attended
most kids with his background wouldnt come within two hundred miles of this place
coach cotton we understand your interest in the young mans athletic abilities
he wouldnt be able to play until he got his grades up anyway
the blind side green revision forget sports
look at the wall
he points to the crest on the wall
beneath it neighborly christian
we either take that seriously or we paint over it
you dont admit michael oher for sports you admit him because its the right thing to do
their faces announce that hes made a point
first day of class
students mostly blonde haired and blue eyed wearing crisply laundered abercrombie and fitch carry their backpacks through the schools arch and converse with friends they havent seen over the summer
michael enters frame
fills it up in fact
he stares at the arch
beneath the school name we read with men this is
possible with god all things are possible
michael takes a deep breath and enters
he carries his school bag a plastic grocery sack
just as before michael moves at a different speed than those around him
makes sense because he is different
not only the color of his skin but his size his clothes short pants and t shirt his eyes taking in the pavement all point to the fact that he
doesnt belong here
small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a wide cautious berth
hes noticed and ogled by everyone
boswells biology class and shes writing on the board in front of a full classroom when michael enters
he pauses and all eyes go to him
boswell does her best to stifle a gasp as she first lays eyes on him
class this is mike oher and hes new here so i expect you all to make him feel welcome
with a warm smile mike take any empty seat
she urges him with a nod
michael walks back and sits in the corner looking terrified
he barely fits in the seat
boswell hands out a stack of papers to each row
as students pass them back to others
this is a quiz based on the information you learned last year in your science curriculum
it wont be graded
i just want to see how much of the information we need to hit again
just answer whatever you know
the student in front of michael hands a sheet back to him and eyes the size of his feet
the students start to work while michael stares at the sheet like its written in greek
boswell watches him for a few seconds before turning back to her work
a bell rings and kids leave classrooms
michael sits alone while mrs
boswell collects the last of the papers
she walks over to michael looks down at his sheet
nothing filled in just his name scrawled at the top
she tries to decide how to deal with this then opts for its okay
can i leave now
she nods and watches him stand and walk away
she glances down at the sheet turns it over and sees
a drawing on the back a boat on an ocean
on the boat is a single stick figure person
its sweet but looks like a third grader drew it
michael lies on a tattered sofa
the lights are out but michaels eyes are open staring at the light emanating from beneath a closed bedroom door
we hear voices
why he gotta always stay here
aint got nowhere else
and hows that your problem
you the red cross all of a sudden
michael tries to shut his eyes
school is out
steven walks up to michael
hey big mike um
my pops girlfriend
she dont really want you to stay with us no more
big tonys taurus pulls into the lot
we can still give you rides if you want
naw its aright
steven gets in the taurus
michael watches it drive away
a girls volleyball game is in progress in the bg
as latecomers move en masse for entry into the gym a small pretty lady on a cell phone moves
against the crowd a salmon on a mission
this is leigh anne tuohy
and shes pissed
on cell phone i dont care if patrick ramsey did approve the chair
hes an nfl quarterback not martha frickin stewart
the blind side green revision she arrives at the concession stand and waits impatiently
theres a difference between bunny williams and lazee boy
three large popcorns and two large diets
when mtv cribs comes to his house hell be showing off his home theatre but all im gonna see is a brown barca lounger
im his designer my names on it
deliver what i ordered
she hangs up angry spots a friend nearby and her frown turns into a smile that could light up a cave
were on the kidspace committee together arent we
itll be a hoot
leigh annes husband sean tuohy handsome confidant and their year old son sj sit watching the game
during a time out sean eyes the crowd sees something odd
in the upper corner of the gym sits michael by himself rubbing his knees
others around him all white have moved away
hes a very large island in the lily white gym
you know that kid
up in the corner
be goes to high school here
his name is big something
sean eyes michael suspiciously
he look like a volleyball fan to you
leigh anne loaded up with refreshments makes her way up the stands to her family
she has a nod a smile a bon mot for everyone she passes
as she sits
whatd i miss
collins got a dig
its girls volleyball mom
you didnt miss anything
leigh anne gives him a look then stands and shouts collins
move your feet
on the court collins tuohy a beautiful year old sighs and gives her mother a look dont embarrass me
the scoreboard tells us that the game is over
fans file out
the tuohy family waits in a group as the volleyball team exits the court
collins well wait outside
and dont double condition in the shower you still have homework
im going over to cannons house to study
can i go
to the johnsons for dinner
they invited me
whats so awful about our house
sean smiles shakes his head as sj and collins leave
seans eyes go to the upper stands where he sees michael alone walking slowly then bending down picking something up taking a few more steps and repeating the process
picking up left over bags of popcorn
sean considers this for a second before leaving
teachers drink stale coffee and chew on donuts
well the big guys been here a month and he aint cutting it in my class
why would admissions do this
its not fair to us or the boy
just setting him up to fail
i dont think he has any idea what im teaching
and how would you know if he did
he wont even talk
boswell cant contain herself
boswell goes toher purse pulls out a crumpled page
he threw this in the trash can
reads from the page i look and i see white everywhere white walls white floors and a lot of white people
the teachers do not know i have no idea of anything they are talking about
i do not want to listen to anyone especially the teachers
they are giving homework and expecting me to do the problems on my own
i have never done homework in my life
i go to the bathroom look in the mirror and say this is not michael oher
a pause for effect he entitled it white walls
the room is dead quiet
hows the spelling
boswell stuffs the page back in her purse and leaves
sean and coach cotton sip coffee while all around them students eat their lunches
they are looking at michael who sits by himself without a tray in front of him
if he makes his grades hell be eligible in the spring
if he makes his grades
but boy hidey just look at him
cotton is admiring michaels size but sean sees something else
he stands walks over to michael who barely looks up
what did you eat for lunch today
here in the cafeteria
i didnt ask where you ate i asked what you ate
a few things
do you need some money
i dont need any
sean walks back over to coach cotton
buy him a semester lunch pass and put it on my bill
off cottons look hes hungry
you could tell that by looking at him
i didnt grow up all that different from him
at public school they give you free lunch bert
and when food is finite youd be surprised how much time you can spend thinking about it
boswell distributes a test to the class
youll have one hour
if you finish early put it on my desk and sit quietly
she looks at the class as they begin to work then sees michael just staring at his test
she sighs makes a decision rises and walks over
mike come with me
filled with supplies and a small desk
boswell points and he sits
you can take the test back here away from everybody else
ill sit in there so if theres anything you dont understand you can ask
michaels eyes go to the page in front of him
he rubs his hands on his knees and stares
boswell waits a beat then scoots her chair over next to him
mike how about i ask the questions and you tell me the answers or as much as you know
she looks at his hands huge next to hers then reads protozoans are classified based on a how they get their food b how they reproduce c how they move
or d both a and c
michael just stares
after a long moment iono
ask questions if you dont understand
but still michael stares at the page
the look on her face says shes about to give up when he lifts his eyes to her and points to the question on the test specifically to the word
it means how things are grouped together
like our class
this science course is classified based on what grade yall are in
michael nods understanding
okay mike you ready to answer the question
he looks at her
same group of teachers
boswell bursts through the door holding the test
he knows it
who knows it and what does he know
i gave him this test verbally
she holds up the test marked with a large red c
on how big a curve
hes been listening the whole time
its amazing what hes absorbed
and trust me hes listening to you too
okay so his reading level is low and he has no idea how to learn in a classroom but
makes her point im not saying hes going to pass but big mike is not stupid
school is out and michael walks among the kids of all shapes and sizes
two little kindergarten girlstry and swing themselves
michael stops nearby watching them
theyre stuck not sure if they should talk to this stranger
they jump off the swings and run away
smile at em
michael turns to see si nearby watching him
the blind side green revision it lets them know youre their friend
did you know that even little kids born blind smile
theyve never seen anyone do it before but they smile anyway
so its universal
thats why it works
not that you should fake it or anything
youre big mike right
out a fist for mike to knock and the two walk toward the school entrance
im sean but everyone calls me si thats for sean junior because my fathers name is sean
he was a basketball star at ole miss point guard and now he owns like a million taco bells
leigh annes car pulls up to the pick up drop off and si starts toward it
michael smiles at the kid who smiles back
leigh anne notices michael as she drives past him
whos that sj
get your feet off my dash
michael watches leigh annes car disappear
michael turns to see paul sandstrom the principal
michael and sandstrom sit on a bench
mike i just got a call from someone at the police department
off michaels look do you remember the story in the papers awhile back about the man who fell off an overpass
michael shakes his head no one knew who he was and theyre not sure if he jumped or if
at any rate he passed away
sandstrom struggles with how to say the words
mike the man
was your father
michael takes this in
without showing emotion
theyve been looking for someone to notify and came across your name on our registry
im really sorry son
were you close
michael shakes his head when did you last see him
ill try and find out where hes buried
maybe we could go visit
michael nods then rises and walks away
michael sits at a bus stop with his bag rises as a bus stops in front of him
the blind side yellow draft pretty seedy
michael walks to a sink in the back opens his plastic sack pulls out an extra t shirt and starts to wash it
a woman the only other patron reads a magazine
when he turns to look at her she becomes quite nervous
she sets down the magazine and walks outside
it seems michael was expecting this because as soon as she leaves he takes his wet t shirt wrings it out walks to her dryer and tosses the shirt inside
to dry with her things
michael sits in the corner his head resting against the window trying to sleep
a banner over the arch reads thanksgiving pageant tonight
kids in costume pilgrims indians turkeys race out the door to greet their proud parents
si in an ornate headdress looks for and spots sean and leigh anne waving
they walk away together toward the parking lot
as they exit the parking lot turn on the heat
i dont know where it is
its fifteen degrees youve had this car a month and you dont know how to turn on the heat
as she turns it on what would you do without
lots of things youll never know about
they trade a look and a smile
sean puts a
hand on her lap
get a room
si dont let this go to your head but i thought you were very convincing in the role of
indian number three
i tried out for the chief but they gave it to andy sung
i cant be sure but i think there was some multi cultural bias thing working
or maybe they just thought hed make a better chief
dad hes like chinese
and youre irish
if you werent the chief how come you got the headdress
si hesitates a bit before dad im gonna need a few more of those free quesadilla tickets
and where does the acorn fall
dont laugh too hard
the quesadilla saved our ass
seans car stops at a red light and michael crosses in front of them wearing just his shorts and short sleeved shirt
leigh anne notices michael what is he wearing
its below freezing
whats his name again
wheres he going
she gives sean a look
sean rolls down his window
hey big mike
michael stops in the crosswalk looks to the car
where you headin
sean nods rolls his window back up and drives as the light turns green
its nine oclock
no answer to this
they drive another half block before turn around
sean sighs knowing better than to argue
the bmw pulls to a stop alongside michael
leigh anne gets out walks up to michael
big mike my name is leigh anne tuohy
my kids go to wingate
you said youre going to the gym
michael slowly nods
the school gyms closed
michael takes this in but doesnt respond
why were you going to the gym
again no answer big mike
why were you going to the gym
this hits her all at once
she bites her lip
do you have anywhere to stay tonight
michael eyes the ground then nods
dont you dare lie to me
sean and sj watch the discussion without hearing any of it
leigh anne looks to sean then back to michael
ive seen that look many times
shes about to get her way
leigh anne makes her way back to the car with michael in tow
she opens the back door and he gets in next to sj in his headdress
leigh anne climbs into the front seat closes the door
sean is looking at her
where we going
the car enters the driveway of a beautiful home and stops
michaels eyes are frozen at the sight
to him it looks like a mansion
hell it is a mansion
the blind side green revision collins in her pjs talks on the phone while watching tv and listening to the stereo
she wears a tangerine cleansing masque on her face
when the family enters behind her howd the dork do in the play
she turns to see
sean leigh anne sj in headdress and big mike
leigh anne lays out pillows sheets blankets on the couch
id give you the guest bedroom but its full of sample boxes
and the sectional in the family room slides apart when you sleep on it
at least thats what sean says
tuohy sleeps on the couch
only when hes bad
theres a powder room right there and were upstairs if you need us
the two share a look then
sleep tight honey
michael is dumbfounded stares at everything in the room then sits on the couch
sj is in the doorway to the kitchen
if you cant sleep my room is the first one at the top of the back stairs
i got x box madden everything
the blind side green revision a michael nods then smiles
sj smiles back gives a thumbs up and disappears
michaels eyes go to a coffee table book norman rockwell
on the cover is freedom from want picturing a family sitting around a dinner table
they lie in bed awake
was this a bad idea
dont lie there and pretend youre not thinking the same thing as me
fine tell me what youre thinking so i can know whats supposed to be on my mind
how well do you know big mike
in case you havent noticed he doesnt have much to say
whats the big deal
its just one night
after a beat it is just one night right
do you think hell steal anything
i guess well know in
he rolls over to go to sleep
leigh anne just sits stares
leigh anne finishes teasing her hair
sean rides an exercise bike
before she leaves the room
if you hear a scream call the insurance adjustor
leigh anne enters collins bedroom
very teenage girl but a mess clothes everywhere
leigh anne opens the curtains throwing light into the room
up and at em
leigh anne picks up a few pieces of clothes
on her way out and groans at the mess
we stay with her as she re enters the hallway walks and opens the door to just as messy but not all clothes
leigh anne almost trips on a series of wires connecting games to a large screen tv
she opens the shades
clean this place up before you come downstairs
you hear me
si crawls out of bed and leigh anne exits the room and starts down the stairs almost afraid of what shell find
leigh anne stops stares the couch is totally back to normal and the sheets blankets and pillows are neatly stacked in almost military precision
no sign of michael
she hears a dog barking in the neighborhood and moves to the window to look out
michael plastic sack in hand walks away
leigh anne exits the front door spots michael and tries to catch up
the blind side yellow draft he stops turns
leigh anne walks over
where are you going
are you spending thanksgiving with your family
michael shakes his head
anne carves turkey onto a tray and takes it into
leigh anne sets the turkey on a serving table alongside the rest of the tuohy thanksgiving feast
come and get it
sean sits at the tv watching an ole miss football game while sj plays
video games on another
collins chats on her cell
michael sits off to the side taking it all in
sj ole miss is about to score
which means theyre about to fumble
they all shuffle over grab plates start piling on food
sean loads his plate and heads back to the couch
looks great hon
collins plate is pretty delicately apportioned
i see a lot of starch
sj jams turkey into a roll and lathers on cranberry sauce creating an easy to eat sandwich
he walks away
michael stares hes never seen so much food
leigh anne hands him a plate
he gingerly puts a slice of
turkey on it
as much as you want
oh the potato salad
with no one watching him michael shoves two rolls into his pants pocket and finishes filling his plate
leigh anne reenters to see michael sitting at the dining room table alone not touching his plate
her eyes go to the rest of her family shoving down food and playing games
she makes a decision grabs the remote and turns off the tvs
the entire family sits at the table
rockwell would be proud
why are we eating in here
leigh anne holds out her hands
shall we say grace
the tuohy family plus michael hold hands
collins stares at her tiny hand intertwined with michaels
as leigh anne prays michael tries to emulate behavior without closing his eyes taking it all in
we thank you for all your many blessings on this family
we thank you for bringing us a new friend
and we ask that you look after
us in this holiday season and never let us forget just how very fortunate we are
a chorus of amens and they all dig in
michael is unsure at first how to correctly use the silverware
he picks up the fork and leigh anne nods thats right
she eyes michaels stained shirt
big mike do you like to shop
off his look because tomorrow i think im gonna have to show you how its done
leigh anne drives and michael sits shotgun
i qot clothes
you have clothes
and an extra t shirt in a plastic bag does not a wardrobe make
he looks out the window
okay fine lets go get em
just tell me where im going
frustrated she pulls the car over to the curb and puts it in park
tell me everything i need to know about you
he still stares out the window
who takes care of you
do you have a mother
a grandmother maybe
leigh anne turns off the car
look big mike we can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way
take your pick
he eyes the floor
tell me one thing i should know about you
after a beat
i dont like to be called big mike
she wasnt expecting this nods her head
mike or michael
off his shrug tell you what from now on to me youre michael
michael where we headed
an expansive beehive of rotting housing
its the place we saw when we first laid eyes on michael and nothings changed
leigh annes car stops at one of the complexes
this is where your mother lives
he nods and she opens her door
okay lets go
he forcefully reaches across her and closes the door catching her off guard
dont get out
whos going to help you with your clothes
dont get out of the car
michael gets out on his side and takes care to push the lock before he closes the door
she watches as he walks toward the structure then notices several of the local neer do wells eyeing her
she locks the doors again just for luck
michael walks slowly past a few gang bangers on the steps
the obvious leader alton eyes him
where you been
michael ignores keeps walking
and whos that fine piece o thing driving you around
one of altons minions david sits nearby
michael sees him nods
david a little embarrassed to be with alton nods back
michael arrives at an apartment and stops taken aback
on the door is an eviction notice and padlock
he reads from the eviction for several seconds
an addict down the way fires up and slumps into bliss
with leigh annes car in the bg
michael hidden from view slumps against a wall looking lost the first real emotions weve seen from him
she watches as michael approaches the building with nothing in his hands and makes his way back to the car
she unlocks it and he crawls inside
after a pregnant moment
she wadnt home
we can come back
michael takes this in looks out the window
she prolly moved to a nicer place
wrong side of the tracks
michael and leigh anne cross the street toward the shop
ive lived in memphis my whole life and never been anywhere near here
youre going to take care of me right
i got your back
thats good to know
as they start to walk leigh anne reaches up and takes michaels arm
he holds it out for her
an african american salesman directs leigh anne and michael
everything i got to fit him will be right here
this is it
if this is all you got whys it say big and tall on the sign
big and tall
you need bigger and taller
he walks away
she starts to pore through the small rack
anything you like
the one thing i know about shopping is that if you dont absolutely love it in the store you wont wear it
the store is where you like it best
and before you choose something think about yourself wearing it and ask yourself is this me
she finds one shirt holds it out
what about this
he shakes his head no
this isnt atrocious
he shakes his head again
after a beat he points
this is the one you like
he nods completely sure
drop off area
leigh annes car pulls up and sj collins and michael get out
have a great day
they say a few good byes get out and walk toward the arch
only then do we see what michael is wearing a gargantuan leigh anne shakes her head watching him walk away
a car behind her honks
she checks the rear view mirror dont get your panties in a wad
ladies who lunch
the right sort doing their thing
leigh anne sits at a table with three friends beth elaine and sherry
they sip on lemon water and nibble at salads
the best part about paris was the food
the blind side yellow draft they use sauce like we use gravy
i had to join a gym the daywe got back
any of yall spent much time on the other side of town
on the freeway
where exactly are you talking about
hurt village that sounds like a threat
youre not far off
it would hurt me to go there
it would certainly hurt your reputation to go there
tongue in cheek im actually from there but didnt mind hard work and look where i am now
eating an eighteen dollar salad
and its a little soggy to be honest
such a shame
re her salad yes it is
civil rights was responsible for some good things but those programs building ugly low cost housing
i mean how could you be creative if you lived there
did you know that black men were employed at a higher rate before those programs
its a fact
theyre not black elaine
the term du jour is african american
and what if theyre from jamaica or like bermuda
then theyre bermudian americans
they all cringe and laugh
so why are you asking about the projects leigh
another one of your charities
a project for the projects
money would raise itself
off their laughs dont laugh
count me in leigh anne
and they laugh harder
leigh anne smiles biting her lip
sj and michael sit at the island doing their homework
it cant be that hard
si looks at the michaels notebook
there are different parts of a sentence and you just have to draw lines showing what they do
sean stops by the refrigerator for a cold drink while he talks on his cell
theyre gonna get rid of those stores in florida
ill look it over now but i need the sales figures by tomorrow morning
dad you remember how to diagram sentences
sean starts to leave then stops at the door turns around sighs and walks over
he leans in over michael
you dont have to help
look i mean if youre busy or somethin
points to page think of a sentence like a football team
this is a noun here see
thats like the team name or what theyre known for whether theyre a running team or a passing team
and this is the verb
thats what makes em go like a star player maybe a quarterback maybe a running back
and this is an adjective everybody oohs and ahs over adjectives but theyre not as important as verbs
theyre like wide receivers
michael just stares at them
you have no idea what were talking about do you
they all laugh
leigh anne watches fixated on the image of the three
sean has an arm on michaels shoulder
she smiles almost sadly
leigh anne hands over clean sheets and pillows to michael who starts to make the bed
do you want to stay here michael
he keeps working
because if you want to
ill try and find some time to figure out a bedroom for you
he stops turns to her
she walks over examines the structure of the couch
it sags a bit
i mean look at this youve practically ruined a
ten thousand dollar couch
she moves closer to him
her face softens
do you want to stay here michael
i dont want to go anyplace else
shes a bit befuddled by the response
leigh anne sits in a chair reading through michaels file
i see here on the admission that were michaels contact for medical emergencies
smith from the admissions meeting sits with her
sean wrote that in last week
we needed a contact number and the ones listed werent in service
love that man
leigh anne pulls out another sheet hands it over
the state makes schools measure for career aptitude in eighth grade
it came with hisfile
they try to figure out what a kids going to be in the eighth grade
it say about michael
smith nods and reads over michaels results
doesnt look promising
spatial relations third percentile
ability to learn fifth percentile
sees another number its funny though
he tested in the th percentile in one category
leigh anne smiles and hands the file back
its just so sad
leigh anne considers this then
yes it is sad
but he either doesnt know it or doesnt think so and its my job and your job to make sure he doesnt find out
smiths look michael oher doesnt feel sorry for himself and ill be damned if he starts to because of the way we treat him
again off her look darned
now turned into michaels room with an armoire a chest of drawers night stands the whole nine yards
the bed is a massive futon in an ornate stand
leigh anne and michael stand in the doorway
i had to put half my samples in storage but well anyway back theres a desk
points as she talks chest odrawers
sean says a lot of pro athletes use futons if they cant find a big enough bed
michael doesnt dare touch anything just stares in awe
well try it out
see if it feels okay
he gingerly moves to the bed touches it
off his look what
never had one before
a room to yourself
we can see this unsettles her
she turns away a bit trying to contain herself
well you got one now
she leaves the room walks down the hall and enters she
closes the door behind her sits on the bed and starts to tear up
she fights it unsuccessfully
michael stands unsure what to do
boswell gives michael in a red and blue rugby shirt an oral test
define osmosis michael
i think i know that
its when water
boswell grades the paper and puts c at the top
michael this time wearing a green and gold rugby shirt is orally tested by glenda
name the combatants in the battle of waterloo
i know that
the little guy napoleon was on one side and
glenda marks down a c michael in another rugby shirt this one black and yellow carries a tray and sits with sj who starts laughing
enough with the rugby shirts
you look like a giant bumble bee
collins walks by with friends and glances but ignores them
whos the big guy hanging around with your little brother
just another one of moms projects
that must get incredibly old
collins look says yes it does
bob grades michaels paper
he writes d
the whole family including michael rides in the car
sj points out fast food restaurants along the way that taco bell
the kfc catty corner
the long john silvers on the next block

leigh anne and sean share a look and a smile

because tonight is a special occasion
i talked to coach cotton today
michaels grades improved enough that he can do springtraining for football in march

michael almost smiles a little unsure
seans car pulls up to the valet
as the family gets out leigh anne notices a bookstore next door and starts for it
ive got a design book i need to get
sean go check on our reservation
theyll seat us when we walk in the door
you can get the book after dinner
already walking away they might be closed by then
i need some new magazines
sj shrugs and joins the girls as does michael
sean watches as his family deserts him
leigh anne finds the book shes looking for and walks through the stacks looking for her kids plus michael
she finds them all together in the childrens section laughing
come on your dads already poed
collins holds up a book
sendaks where the wild things are
remember this one mom
you read it to us like a thousand times
she softens walks over takes the book
and he gnashed his terrible teeth and roared his terrible roar
i always liked this one
he holds up the story of ferdinand
yeah me too
leigh anne sees michael left out but interested
michael your mama ever read either one of those to you
he just stares at her the answer obvious
no one ever
the tuohy family exits and waits for the valet
now that was a good steak
as the car pulls up everyone walks toward it except michael who notices something else at the side door a busboy steps outside for a smoke
michael absently walks over
leigh anne touches seans arm silencing him
they watch as michael greets the busboy
they stand a few feet apart talking
they nod at each other and after a few seconds they hug
leigh ann is amazed
shes never seen affection in michael
as they drive home
who was that boy you were talking to michael
at the restaurant
he works there
and how do you know marcus
hes my brother
complete silence in the car
leigh anne finally breaks it well id like to meet him someday
would that be okay with you
i dont know where he stays
whens the last time you saw him michael
when i was little mebbe
collins sits on the floor in the hallway near a door smiling sadly and secretly listening to once upon a time in spain there was a little bull a strange
leigh anne sj and michael all sit on michaels huge futon as leigh anne reads the story of ferdinand
no one enjoys this more than leigh anne
and his name was ferdinand
all the other little bulls he lived with would run and jump and butt their heads together but not ferdinand
he liked to sit just quietly and smell the flowers
leigh anne and sean sit in bed
sean puts his book on the night stand and leans over to give leigh anne a kiss
he notices her smile
the blind side yellow draft what
why are you smiling
i dont know
im just happy
this happiness have anything to do with michael
it has everything to do with michael
sean smiles kisses her turns off the light
she snuggles next to him and kisses the back of his neck
he gets the message rolls over and kisses her on the lips
as their amorous activities continue
i think we should start a charity
for kids like him
his mind elsewhere sure okay
maybe fund a program at wingate
are you even listening to me
i try to concentrate on one thing at a time
you knew i was a multi tasker when you married me
she kisses him and they roll over laughing
the tuohy family dressed nice poses in front of a blueand red artificial christmas tree adorned entirely with ole miss ornaments
they are posing for a photograph
okay big smiles everyone
leigh anne smiles but notices michael sitting on the couch by himself
come over here and get in the next one
sean gives her a look like shes crazy
we dont have a single picture with him
off seans sigh oh come on
its not like im gonna put it on the christmas card
michael moves in behind the family dwarfing them
okay really big smiles

collins sits on the couch reading
leigh anne comes in the front door with groceries

patrick ramsey on his cell phone near his locker
you sent me these measurements for clothes and i posted em in the locker room for donations but theres a problem
the blind side yellow draft i mean are you sure the sizes are right because theres nobody on our team whos that big

leigh anne chuckles as the next message begins hey sean hey leigh anne its cousin bobby
happy new years
bobby sits in his recliner talks on phone
listen ive had about five cold ones soim just gonna go ahead and ask
whos the colored boy in yalls christmas card
leigh anne and sean look at each other and laugh
leigh anne you looked teeny tiny next to him
leigh anne sits at a table with her lunch buddies
theyre finishing up and are all laughing hard except leigh anne
it was like you were jessica lange and he was king kong
i taped your card to the fridge
the next morning frank almost gagged on his orange juice
does michael get the family discount at taco bell
because if he does seans gonna lose a few stores
look hes a great kid
i say just make it official and adopt him
big laughs at the crazy idea
hell be eighteen in a few months
off their confusion so i mean it wouldnt make much sense to legally adopt him right
they realize shes thought about it and stop laughing
after an awkward beat of silence
is this some kind of white guilt thing leigh anne
i mean charitys the lords work but
what will your daddy say
before or after he turns over in his grave
daddys gone five years now elaine and to make matters worse you were at the funeral
you wore chanel with that awful black hat
before elaine can attack look heres the deal
i dont need any of yall to approve of my choices
but i do ask you to respect them
you have no idea what this boys been through
and if this is going to be a running diatribe i can find an overpriced salad a lot closer to home
im so sorry leigh anne
we didnt intend to no we didnt really i mean what youre doing is so great
to open your home to him
youre changing his life
leigh anne smiles to herself realizing
hes changing mine
thats awesome for you but
what about collins
what about collins
arent you worried even just a little
off leigh anne i mean he is a boy a large black boy sleeping under the same roof
leigh anne stares at them shakes her head then grabs the ive got this
rises to the group shame on you
and strides away
collins is reading in bed
leigh anne knocks enters and sits on the edge of the bed
be honest with me now okay
collins nods having no idea what her mother is about to say
is michael being here weird for you
theyre stupid kids who cares what they say
and what do the juvenile kids say
its really not worth repeating
and dont worry about sj he loves the attention
he introduces michael as his big brother
what about you
off leigh annes look i mean you cant just throw him out on the street
i can make other arrangements
off collins hesitance just let me know
leigh anne kisses collins goodnight
michael walks up to the two little kindergarten girls from before sitting in the swings
they smile back
need a push
they giggle and michael pushes them one arm each until theyre flying high and squealing
collins is sitting with her friends laughing and whispering
she notices michael enter and walk to a table with a book
he sits alone while every other table is full
collins sighs makes up her mind and stands with her books
where are you going
collins walks away toward michael
they are aghast when they see collins set down her books across from michael and sit
michael is confused
she looks at him and shakes her head
quit looking at me like that
i mean we study together at home
eyes in the library are on the pair as they start to read
several players in full gear drag equipment out onto the field under the watchful eye of bert cotton
sean tuohy sits in the nearby stands
michael carries four blocking dummies to the center of the field and tosses them like theyre pillows
you know how much those things weigh
this kids gonna make us all famous
its only the spring and he hasnt even been through his first practice
michael is lined up at defensive tackle
the offense breaks the huddle and michael just stands there
he notices the other defensive linemen get in a stance and kind of squats a bit
when the ball is snapped he just holds his hands out keeping the blocker from getting close to his body
the running back races right past him and into the secondary
the whistle blows and cotton races up to michael
okay mike you fought off the block but youve got to shuck him and make the tackle
you got it
michael gets down in a his stance and when the ball is snapped he gets under the blocker and lifts him up like wwf
the quarterback goes back to pass and sees michael lumbering toward him with the lineman on his shoulders
the quarterbacks eyes go wide and he races out of the pocket and throws and incomplete pass
shuck the blocker mike
michael gingerly sets the lineman on the ground
leigh anne shows up sits next to sean
hows he doing
doesnt quite have the hang of it yet
michael tries to crawl under the blocker
michael drops back and tries to intercept a pass
michael holds a blocker off him with one arm and looks skyward as a flock of birds flies overhead
as players leave the field bert cotton walks and talks with leigh anne and sean
most kids from bad situations cant wait to be violent and that comes out on the field
but this kid he doesnt seem to wanna hit anyone
almost to herself hes ferdinand the bull
i thought for sure he was gonna be a player
i cant believe i used up my chits to get him in school
i thought you said it was your christian duty
he gives her a smirk
look bert hes never even played before
and he wont in the fall if he doesnt improve a lot before then
si holding a sheet and wearing a whistle stands before michael
no one elseis around
this is your summer workout sheet
first it says to warm up and get loose
off michaels look well go ahead get loose
michael moves his arms around a bit then stops
okay next is five one hundred yard runs to stretch out your legs
lets go home play some video games
look everybody at
wingate is expecting you to be a star football player
you dont want to let them down do you
what about dad and mom
off michaels look cause you see in our family everyones an athlete
dad was a basketball star collins plays volleyball and runs track
me as you know i do it all and mom
well mom was a cheerleader which doesnt exactly count but dont tell her i said that
michael moves to the line
si raises his whistle and blows
sj holds a blocking dummy and michael fires out hitting the dummy and sending si flying
michael does ten yard back and forths as si times him
michael does push ups as sj lowers himself to count
michael does crab crawls
wide sj runs michael through his workout
he blows his whistle and michael collapses on the ground dead tired
leigh anne goes through sample boxes and matches swatches
michael stands nearby
i hear mrs
tuohy i look over my shoulder for my mother in law
call me leigh anne or mama or almost anything else
will you help get me something
why do you need a drivers license when you dont have a car
you have a car
that i use to haul yall all over creation with
he doesnt say anything but doesnt leave either
leigh anne puts down the swatches turns to him
why do you want a license michael
something to carry
with my name on it
she locks eyes with him
this time he holds her gaze
leigh anne and michael sit across from a dmv employee typing on her computer
leigh anne holds out her drivers license
is this his address as well
he lives with us
are yall his foster parents
his legal guardians
the employee does a search on the computer
as she types
does he have a social security card
leigh anne looks to michael who shakes his head
we tried to find one for school but
you dont know which city which county which hospital
how big a problem is this
dmv employee looks to leigh anne
theres nobody named michael oher in the system
another last name perhaps
leigh anne again turns to michael who shrugs
look ill sign something saying he lives with us and well pay for the insurance whatever it takes
off her look whats it gonna take
off the employees look as they get ready for bed
sean rinses his mouth you wanna do what
dont pretend you didnt hear me
shouldnt we at least talk about it
what do you think were doing
and dont act like im going behind your back
i know you put us down as his medical contact at school
theres a big difference between paying for a broken arm and being legally responsible for someone
someone we barely know
and thats another thing
we have to find out more about his past
he wont talk about it
hes like an onion you have to peel it a layer at a time
not if you use a knife
what if we sent him to a child psychologist
do you really expect big mike expect michael to lie down and talk about his childhood like hes woody allen or something
michaels gift is his ability to forget
hes mad at no one and doesnt really care what happened in the past
this puts her on her heels
like hes never heard excuse me
off her grimace howd those words taste coming out of your mouth
she moves to him holds him
at least promise me youll think about it
alright youll think about it or alright we should do it
is there a difference
leigh anne sits in a crowded waiting area talking on her cell phone
shes been here awhile
just tell rodney to hold the chiffonier for me and ill get by after while
she hangs up and exasperated by the wait rises and walks a counter pushing past someone im not cutting just asking
ive been waiting for over an hour and i look around and all i see is people shooting the bull and drinking coffee
who runs this place anyway
the heard it all employee points to the wall with a government seal and a large portrait of president bush
well id have it in shape in two days i can tell you that
im sure you would
how can i help you
she turns to the man waiting behind her
he was first
no you go ahead
i think i
want to hear this
i do not appreciate the attitude
maam you can tell me what you want or ill make sure you wait all day
id like to become a legal guardian
lord look over that child
a haggard manager lets call him ronald sits across from leigh ann
he looks at a flimsy file
theres very little on michael
most of his files have been lost
what is in there
a few case notes
holds one sheet up this one describes an incident where officers forcibly removed michael and six half siblings from denise ohers care when michael was seven
quite a scene evidently
they had to split up the kids
and its far from the worst
where is she
dunno but if you find her we have a bunch more files we could add to
how many children does she have
at least a dozen probably more
with her drug arrest record my guess would be she cant even remember
leigh anne absorbs this
wed need her permission though right
michael is a ward of the state
just apply and get a judge to sign off on it
so you would give him away without even telling his mother
looks the same as before except for theblonde woman walking between the buildings
leigh anne spots and checks a list of tenants posted
she can barely see through the cover as someone has scrawled c block on it
the one michael visited before
leigh anne summons her courage and knocks on the door
a voice comes from the apartment behind her who you lookin for
startled leigh anne turns and sees alton approaching
im looking for denise oher
dee dee dont stay there no more
do you know where she might be
chances are she aint gone far
i seen you before
you with big mike now
you wanna come in for a wine cooler or sumthin
no i cant but thank you
leigh anne speaks with a mother trying to keep her son from hurting himself on a rusty slide
the mother points to another building
a door opens revealing denise oher in a ratty robe
you from the state
name is leigh anne tuohy and your son michael lives with me
and my family
denise takes this in
leigh anne sits on the edge of a filthy couch and eyes
there are sleeping pallets on the floor and empty wine and beer bottles strewn around
how is my boy hows big mike
hes doing well
after a beat when did you move from the other building
denise emerges from the back of the apartment adjusting a wig on her head making herself presentable
this is temporary
friends let me stay here
when did you last see michael
we might have some wine in the kitchen if
no no thats very kind but
how many foster kids you got living with you
oh im not a foster parent to michael
we were just helping him out
state dont pay you nothing
and he lives with you
leigh anne nods and you feed him
buy him clothes too
when i can find them in his size
you a fine christian lady
i try to be
this is all real nice what youre doing but dont be surprised if one day you wake up and he gone
what do you mean
hes a runner
thats what the state called him after they took him from me
off her look every foster home they sent him to hed slip out the window at night and come looking for me
no matter where i was that boy would come find me take care of me
ive had some
oher was michael born under a different name
denise tries to remember
after a few seconds
that was his daddys last name
where is he the father if you dont mind me asking
seen him since he left
and when was that
week after mike was born
do you have michaels birth certificate
denise sighs looks around at the mess shakes her head
and then unexpectedly starts to cry softly
its okay mrs
ill figure it out
leigh anne walks over kneels and takes denises hands
youll always be michaels mama
would you like to see him
not this way
people lose birth certificates
its nothing to be ashamed of
off leigh annes look his last names williams
couldnt even remember who the boys father is
leigh anne bites her lipand puts her arms around denise who hugs back
the entire tuohy family sits with michael at the table
michael we have something to ask you
anne and i would like to become your legal guardians
whats that mean
well what it means is we want to know if youd like to be a part of this family
michael looks to a grinning sj to collins who nods and smiles then to leigh anne
i kinda thought i already was
leigh anne feels a wave of emotion nods to him then races away to go and gather herself
michael looks to sean for an explanation
sean shrugs cant explain her to you
when it clears we see michaels face on a drivers license
michael blindfolded is led outside by the entire family
when leigh anne pulls if off michael gasps at the sight of a new truck in the driveway
is that the one you wanted
he just stands there staring
sean hands him the keys
well hell take it for a spin
off michaels look go on
can i go too
okay but michael
off his look be careful
michael smiles and he and sj get inside the truck
he wanted a truck
michael thinks hes a redneck
michael drives up in his new truck parks it carefully
at the drop off big tonys car sputters away leaving steven at the curb
steven notices michael and walks over eyeing the truck
tenth grade tough
points to truck this really yours
they just give it to ya
after a beat
white people are crazy
and they walk off together to class
students seated including michael listen to bob who stands at the front of the classroom
you are now seniors
but with that distinction comes responsibility
this will be one of your tougher courses because my job is to prepare you at least most of you for the rigors of college freshman english
you are each holding a class study guide which details assignments
i wont remind you what is due and when
read the materials and come prepared
at the end of the year you will each choose one of our literature assignments and present a written dissection of the piece
the faces in the classroom tell us this is a tough course
condiment jars and bottles are lined up on the table
sj has the football playbook open and is explaining formations to michael
see youre the ketchup here at left tackle
on the weakside
im not that weak sj
it just means there are more blockers on the other side
its a compliment really
a compliment for a condiment
back to work so the first play is simple
it just means you block whoever is in front of you or the person on your inside shoulder if youre not covered by a defender
points to condiments ill be the running back and you show me what youre supposed to do
sj using both hands moves cayenne pepper back a bit then hands off to cinnamon who runs toward michael ketchup
michael moves the bottle forward pushing back mustard then relish as well as toppling a bottle of vanilla extract
open lane to the end zone
all there is to it
si slides cinnamon forward
the bottle flies off the end of the table and crashes on the ground just as leigh anne walks down the stairs purse in hand what is going on here
cinnamon just scored
were going through the playbook
michael got moved to offense
well when youre finished put the players back in the spice cabinet
actually mom we were waiting for you
the new madden came out and me and michael want to go get it
honey ive got a meeting in ten minutes
off her look michael drives while sj searches for music on the radio
look for walker street
thats where we take a left
si finds a hip hop station and they both groove to the beat dancing in the seats
thats what im talkin bout
as the beat reaches a crescendo michael instinctively throws a big arm in front of sj as the truck crashes into the side of a van
leigh anne with a client is looking at rugs with the owner
this is not a twenty thousand dollar oushak jerry
the borders are different widths its been altered
leigh annes phone rings
as she answers well give you nine tops
the look on her face changes a massive traffic jam
leigh anne pulls her car right onto the median gets out and starts running
she passes stopped cars and weaves past bystanders on her way to as she approaches she sees michaels truck the front end is smashed the van its side caved in
and michael sitting on the curb crying
she races over michael
he looks up sobbing
im so sorry im so sorry
go help him
please go help him
leigh anne turns to see a group of paramedics kneeling around a body
she gasps races over and looks down at si whose face is bloody
he spots leigh anne and sits up
mom do you think the blood will come out of my shirt
while the paramedics attend to an obviously fine sj leigh anne and a fireman eye the deflated airbag
an airbag deploys at miles per hour
your sons too small to sit in the front seat
hes okay though right
busted lip some facial bruising
when an airbag strikes a child his size it usually means a fractured face a broken neck or worse
its almost like the airbag started at him then changed direction
defective or something
very very lucky
leigh anne nods thanks and looks to michael still on the curb eyes on the ground
she walks over kneels down
michael it wasnt your fault
it could have happened to anybody
he doesnt look up
she almost gasps when she notices his arm red bleeding a large burn from the wrist all the way up to the sleeve which is also singed
michael your arm
he looks up and into her eyes
i stopped it
sj sits in the stands videotaping note we integrate sjs video with live action
on the field michael skips to the line and gets down in his stance
on the snap michael pushes the tackle jay collis who rolls gets by michael and makes the tackle
youve got a hundred pounds on collis and you cant keep him out of our backfield
leigh anne sits down next to sj
with the camera
michael does better when he can see what hes supposed to be doing
the quarterback drops back to pass
when the defender tries
to go around him michael grabs him
with one big paw and throws him to the ground
a whistle blows
holding left tackle
he gets right in michaels face grabs his jersey
you can only grab in here at the tits you got it
you grab out here or here were gonna get flagged and im gonna get pissed
leigh anne grimaces shakes her head
at the snap of the ball michael tries to pass protect pushes the defender who tries left right then slides past michael and sacks the quarterback
move your feet son
keep em moving
back to the huddle
cotton addresses an assistant coach
well at least hell look good coming off the bus
the other team will be terrified til they realize hes a marshmallow
as they chuckle leigh anne strides past onto the field
gimme a minute bert
were in the middle of practice leigh anne
you can thank me later
bert just watches as leigh anne walks straight to the huddle and pulls michael aside
the other players turn to watch
do you remember just after we met and we went to that horrible part of town to buy you those dreadful clothes
and i was a little scared and you told me not to worry that you had my back
do you remember that
if anyone tried to get to me you would have stopped them right
and when you and si were in that car wreck what did you do to that airbag
i stopped it
leigh anne points to the offense
this team is your family
and you have to protect them points to defense from those guys
she walks over and grabs the qb pulls him out
tony is your quarterback
you protect his blindside
when you look at him think of me
how you have my back
how you have his
she grabs bobby a short stump of a running back
oomaloompah here is your tailback
when you look at him think of sj and how youd never let anything or anyone hurt him
do you understand me
what about mr
tuohy and collins
i suppose they can be on the team too
are you going to protect the family michael
she nods back and walks away past bert cotton
yelling at him wont help
he doesnt trust men
in his experience they pretend to care about you til they disappear
she walks over and sits next to sj who has the video camera in his lap
youre gonna wanna get this
at the snap michael drives the defender into the dirt
michael drops back knocks down one defender then takes on another while tony completes a pass
on a sweep to his side michael pushes three defenders away clearing an alley for bobby to blast through
bert shakes his head turns to leigh anne whatd you say to him
you should get to know your players bert
he tested percent in protective instincts
off berts look i told you you
could thank me later
a beat for effect its later bert
thank you leigh anne
packedhouse bands banners cheerleaders
in the stands sean leigh anne and sj take their seats and check out the raucous crowd
so much for home field advantage
you ever seen so many rednecks in one place
nascar not even close
coach cotton is addressing his team before the game
on the schedule it says this is a home game but dont be deceived gentlemen
three fourths of the people in the stands are here from milford
theyll be loud and rowdy and a lot of em drunk
keep your helmets on til youre on the sidelines
i dont want anyone getting beaned with a whiskey bottle
grab a knee
and the team huddles for their prayer
for we can
team repeats each phrase do all things
through jesus christ
who strengthens us
each and every day
and may god
bless the crusaders
as they rise to leave oh one more thing
the reason milford traveled all that way to come here is they expect to whup your ass
whup your ass and have a party in your house
whup your ass have a party in your house and piss on your mamas new couch
is that gonna happen
the team erupts with a chorus of no
s and hell no
as the wingate crusaders exit the dressing room they find themselves next to the milford lions ready to take the field
the cocky milford players eye the crusaders
hey crusaders yall gonna turn the other cheek or just bend over
another milford player spots michael
would yall look at the size of that buck
milford takes the field
jay collis to michael
pay em back on the field
coach cotton raises a hand and the team moves forward to squeeze through an entrance onto the field
above them milford fans look down and jeer toss sodas at them
the blind side yellow draft damn that aint fair
they got a big ole black bear playing for em
what is this a circus
leigh anne sean and sj cheer as wingate runs onto the field
a chorus of boos comes from the stands behind them
theres the lions and here come the christians
sj turns and gives a dirty look sj eyes forward
sticks and stones
the ball is kicked off and bobby the crusaders tailback takes it in at the five yard line
he makes one player miss then is dragged down by a swarm of defenders at the twenty
the offense runs onto the field and huddles
the milford defense waits slapping each other and building to a frenzy
number from before is the defensive end on michaels side
wingate breaks huddle and sees him
look whose fat black ass i get to kick all night long
at the snap sidesteps michael and sacks the qb
as he walks by michael all night long fat ass
all night long
leigh anne and sean share a look and cheer on the team
the blind side yellow draft come on michael
wingate breaks huddle and as they get into their stances calls a switch
he moves inside and the linebacker moves outside
michael looks at the move confused
tony the wingate qb starts to drop back but hands off the ball on a draw to bobby the oompaloompah
michael unsure which player to block just stands there while they both crush bobby
the milford players high five and both give michael a shoulder as they pass him
michael hits square in the numbers putting him on his heels
but hes quick as a cat and jumps to bat down a pass
the crusaders offense leaves the field
follows behind michael taunting him
and dont come back unless you want me to embarrass your black ass
get back to your own bench
laughs and struts away
cotton goes straight to the ref
did you hear what he said
are you gonna just let that kinda talk go
ever heard of the first amendment coach
get back to the sideline
cotton takes a deep breath then turns to michael who has been beside him the whole time
look son is quick so just focus on his belt buckle
where it goes he goes
and block til the whistle blows
michael nods and takes a seat on the bench
cotton hears something and realizes it is his cell phone
he looks at the number calling
leigh anne is on the phone
enough with the trick plays bert
just run the dang ball
bert on the field turns to the stands shakes his head hangs up angrily
behind the tuohys the milford fans are in a frenzy
thats my boy jimmy number
he is kicking that blue gums ass
leigh anne cant restrain herself
she rises turns hey crotch mouth
zip it or ill come zip it for ya
sean pulls her back down to her seat
sticks and stones
the milford offense is moving the ball a draw play for ten yards
a screen pass for twenty
an option play the qb pitches out and the tailback turns the corner and runs all the way to the end zone
the scoreboard reads home visitors
bert cotton gathers his forces
its all right
the crusaders have the ball at the twenty
they break from the huddle get over the ball and the play starts
its a sweep left and michael pulls to lead for bobby
fends off michael and keeps moving forcing a pileup near the sideline
michael and bobby are at the bottom of the pile
extricates himself from the pile and gives michael a little kick as a cherry on top
big black pile of nigger crap
cotton is nearby hears this races straight over to the ref
ref you gonna do something about this
he kicked my boy in the head and cussed him
the ref throws a flag
unsportsmanlike conduct on wingate
shut up or youll get another fifteen
what happened to the first amendment
cotton throws his hat and another ref throws a flag
this young man plays for my team and i will defend him like hes my own son
against you or any other redneck sonofabitch
michael watches dumbfounded
he walks over to the livid cotton and pulls him backwards looks him in the eye
dont worry coach
i got your back
cotton cools down
michael trots out onto the field
halfway there he stops looks back at cotton and smiles
michael looks to tony
coach called a pass
as wingate lines up is at it again
your coach always do your fightin for you
he your massa
michael gets in his stance and on the snap of the ball powers forward
weve never seen him so quick neither has who dips a hip to keep from being plowed over
the ploy rights but the damage isnt over as michael now has him in the fit grabbing his jersey between the tits
bobby races through the hole and into the secondary michael keeps pushing back picking up speed until is airborne save every third step of michaels when he touches a toe
to the ground like a ballerina bobby cuts to the sideline michael is running full speed with now and he keeps going past the sideline past collins and the rest of the cheerleaders while bobby makes the opposite corner and heads for the end zone the blind side yellow draft si is on his feet filming michael michael keeps going past the track and toward the fence separating the field from the parking lot just as bobby races into the end zone michael chucks into the air
hits the fence hard and lands in a heap
michael turns and walks back to the field
as he passes collins she gives him a high five
way to go big bro
a referee signals touchdown then notices michael walking back and lying slumped at the fence
the ref throws a flag
was he holding
did he hit after the whistle
i dont believe so
then whats the flag for
youre kidding me
the referee ignores and returns to the field to assess the penalty
now on his feet limps back onto the field
michael looks at him and s eyes go straight to the dirt
cotton walks up to michael
i stopped when i heard the whistle
where were you taking him mike
to the bus
it was time for him to go home
cotton smiles proudly and slaps michael on the ass
attaboy michael oher
leigh anne stands and turns to face the milford fans see number seventy four
well thats my son
the milford fans dont know what to make of this
leigh anne sits down with a self satisfied smile
tony throws a touchdown pass submarines and michael pushes him down with one hand bobby is off to the races with a screen pass
and another touchdown scoreboard reads visitors home limps off the field shamed and another player takes his place
the scrub terrified looks to michael
at the snap the scrub flinches and hits the dirt
the play goes to the other side and michael reaches a hand down to help the scrub up and to his feet
si has the video of michael up on his computer
a burned dvd pops out and sj puts it in a distinctive case
a hub of activity
move past a secretary answering phones tom lemming recruiting please hold
tom lemming recruiting please hold
and land on tom lemming the foremost college talent forecaster in the country
did the monthly recruiting updates get mailed
coach saban wants his fed exed
does he really think getting it one day early is gonna give lsu a leg up
an assistant hurries up
have you filled all the slots for the army all star game
the assistant hands over the distinctive dvd marked michael you might want to open one up
lemming walks along with sean and coach cotton toward seans office
every year there are a dozen running backs in the high school ranks who will make it to the nfl
quarterbacks maybe three or four
but left tackles true left tackles theyre freaks gifts from the gods
a great one only comes around every four or five years
mikes the best ive seen in ten
i dont kid about guys wholl get fifty million or more to play football
and you think that could be michael
the embarrassing thing is its my business to know every prospect in the nation but if you hadnt sent me that dvd i would have never heard of him
i didnt send a dvd
youre sean tuohy right
sean gets it trades a look with cotton
they arrive at an empty office where michael sits
he stands and lemming eyes him like a piece of meat
lemming breaks out a measuring tape and smiles
sean and bert stand outside and talk
tom lemming runs the biggest recruiting service in the nation
he practically created an industry
every college coach subscribes to his newsletter
one word from him and
this is big sean
lemming sits across from michael
mike i came all the way from chicago just to see for myself
and now that i have id like to extend to you an invitation to play in the army high school all american game at the end of the season
he places an application on the desk
michael stares at it
the door opens and lemming comes out shaking his head
i dont want to offend but
does mike have special needs
well he eats a lot
no i meant is he mentally
no no hes just
because the only thing he said to me was no
said it three times every time i asked him if hed like to play in the army all star game
i get lobbied by every player every father every coach to get into this game
hands over application let me know if he changes his mind
lemming walks away
after hes gone michael emerges
why didnt you fill out the application michael
the blind side green revision i dont wanna join the army
sean and coach cotton crack up
nick saban watches on a computer tommy tuberville and other auburn coaches watch houston nutt and arkansas coaches watch lou holtz and south carolina coaches watch phil fulmer and other
tennessee coaches watch
i want him
i want him bad
a cadillac races into the parking lot and hurriedly parks in a spot
phil ful mer in a bright orange tennessee shirt jumps out and starts to trot toward leigh anne helps coach the cheerleaders including collins
kick higher collins
point your toes
leigh anne notices fulmer
what in the world
to the squad yall keep practicing
the blind side green revision she strides toward the football practice field
leigh anne arrives to see a group of coaches all wearing shirts and hats emblazoned with school logos
they chat and watch as the wingate football team finishes calisthenics
one assistant coach from
southern miss sees fulmer racing up
shoot man fulmers here
i might as well go home
fulmer smiles at the assembled coaches shakes a few hands
drove all the way from knoxville to come see for myself
leigh anne slides in near the group so she can eavesdro heck i drove from clemson thats nine hours
bert cotton walks over shakes fulmers hand leaving the other coaches shaking their heads
coach fulmer its a real honor
coach cotton i been keeping an eye on your program
yall doing a fine job down here
wouldnt be a bit surprised to see you coaching at the next level real soon
cottons smile tells us hed like that a lot
is that him
is that ohair
like a paddle in a boat
fulmer notices leigh anne grunts then turns back to cotton
if you could run him through a few drills wed sure appreciate it
cotton gives leigh anne a look that says get out of here
she shakes her head im not going anywhere
cotton blows his whistle and the team approaches
big mike and jay collis
best on best
an equipment manager lays out a plank and jay collis sighs and lines up one foot on either side of the board
michael slowly moves into position opposite him
the coaches all inch closer and crane their necks to see
leigh anne is now right in the middle of them
fulmer gives her a look that says who the hell are you
cotton blows his whistle michael fires out and its over in an instant
collis is pancaked under michael who gets up and offers a hand
the coaches are frozen as if theyve witnessed a miracle
almost to himself force equals mass times acceleration
then all at once the coaches pull out their cell phones and start poking digits and jabbering you wont believe it
you gotta see this
hes a freak of nature
the clemson coach strides away
where are you going coach
back to south carolina
ive seen more than enough
if he can qualify with his grades you tell michael oher that clemson wants him
good luck with that brad
fulmer smiles wide then turns to look once more at michael
leigh anne watches him watch michael
leigh anne distressed has books and pamphlets spread out in front of her
sean walks in takes in the sight
did you know that to be eligible for a division one scholarship michaels gonna need a
his act is low and i dont see him doing any better if he retakes it
whats his gpa now
not bad really when you consider where he started
he needs to make as this year
off seans laugh im serious
and that might not even be enough
so he goes to junior college
most inner city kids that go to jc drop out in a year
his shot at the pros would go out the window
are we even sure hes gonna get college offers
she walks over to the answering machine presses play
the blind side green revision hello my name is nick saban and im the head football coach at louisiana state university

leigh ann and sean sneak looks at miss sue and michael at the dining room table
michael stares at a problem in geometry book then

michael turns to sj who raises his hand

saban smiles at the kids moxie

the blind side green revision michael pancakes an opponent michael and miss sue study you know this stuff

houston nutt walks in the tuohy front door hi im houston nutt from arkansas
michael pancakes another defender miss sue high fives michael after a quiz phil fulmer walks in recognizes leigh anne this is a beautiful home maam
he is startled to see michael in briefs racing down the stairs carrying collins who is holding his pants away from him
boswell grades michaels paper writes b at the top
the blind side green revision michael and coach cotton hold up a championship trophy coaches one after another enter the tuohy home hi im tommy tuberville
hi im lou holtz
sj asks them each his question what level of access can i expect
coaches one after another up the ante your own locker right next to michaels
access to the lettermans lounge
with a wink a gamecock headdress
well run arm in arm onto the field and you can do the coin toss thingie at the first game
sounds real good
michael studies with miss sue in her ole miss sweatshirt
the blind side yellow
draft have you decided yet michael
no miss sue
but you like tennessee
off his nod its a good school
not at the academic level of ole miss but they do have an outstanding science department
you know one of the things theyre famous for
he shakes his head they work with the fbi to study the effects of the soil on decomposing body parts
michael is a bit lost
when they find a body the police want to know how long theyve been dead
the fine department at tennessee helps them
they have lots of body parts arms legs hands from hospitals and medical schools
do you know where they store them
michael shakes his head right underneath the football field
michaels eyes widen a bit
so while its fine and dandy to have fans cheering for you the bodies you should be worried about are right underneath the turf
set to poke up through the ground and grab you
she raises a clawed hand think carrie to make her point
michael is completely freaked out by this
but its your decision where you play football
dont let me influence you
the blind side green revision ole miss coach ed orgeron talks with leigh anne
congrats on gettin hired coach
thank yew maam
ole miss is my dream job
coach youre coming a little late to the party but were diehard rebels so im gonna give you a frickin road map okay
lsu is out
everybody knows sabans going to the nfl
so when he comes for his visit to ole miss dont take him to some titty bar and give him tequila shots
hell have nightmares for weeks
feed him italian he likes fettucine alfredo take him to a movie but not chainsaw massacre because hell just cover his eyes and put him to bed by ten
you got it
what about tennessee
it breaks my heart but theyre still in the hunt
fulmer offered sj a sweet deal
i hear the kid can really pepper the gumbo
hes his daddys boy
orgeron sits with michael and sj
you a ole miss tackle son
im buildin my line buildin my team aroun you
make your parents proud come to oxford get that sheepskin and help us win the sec
michael nods turns to sj
before sj can raise his hand and for you si heres what i can do
at ole miss we have the grove by the stadium
and the team walks it before the game surrounded by thousands of fans
its a sacred ritual
and im in front
seen it a thousand times
ever seen it from the front of the line
next year you and me leading the team
tennessee offered to let me run on the field and flip the coin
ill throw in a sideline pass
si considers this smiles and nods
a press conference is under way
photographers push to get a shot of michael at a table stares at three caps tennessee lsu and ole miss
he smiles and selects an ole miss hat
fulmer watches the press conference on tv
he tosses a piece of chalk against the wall
this stinks to high heaven
leigh anne and bob have a chat in the empty classroom
i will not give a student a grade he or she doesnt deserve
he needs a b
whats he gonna have to do to deserve that
right now michaels doing c minus d plus work
his best chance at improving is with the written essay at the end of the year
it counts for a third of his grade
miss sue works with michael at the table
why not write about great expectations
youre a lot like pip
he was poor an orphan and someone sort of found him
you should be able to relate to that
sean is nearby watching nba basketball
fine lets go through the reading list
but you have to pick one michael
reading from list pygmalion
a tale of two cities
the charge of the light brigade
almost to himself half a league half a league half a league onward
i love that one
the blind side yellow draft fine you do this and ill watch basketball
miss sue walks over takes the remote from sean who rises
all in the valley of death rode the six hundred
they call lsus stadium death valley because of this story
alfred lord tennyson is writing about ole miss lsu
its a great story
its a poem
forward the light brigade
thats like the offense
charge for the gunshe said
thats the end zone
into the valley of death rode the six hundred
he knows it by heart and even miss sue is impressed
forward the light brigade
was there a man dasmayd
not tho the soldier knew someone had blundered
someone made a mistake
yeah their leader their coach
why would they go ahead if they knew he messed up
theirs not to make reply theirs not to reason why theirs but to do and die into the valley of death rode the six hundred
it hits michael
he takes a moment looks right at sean
they all gonna die arent they
thats really really sad
i think you just found something to write about
michael opens his notebook picks up a pen
courage is a hard thing to figure
you can have courage based on a dumb idea or a mistake but youre not supposed to question adults or your coach or your teacher because they make the rules
maybe they know best but maybe they dont
michael moves through the tough crowd
it all depends on who you are where you come from
didnt at least one of the six hundred guys think about giving up and joining with the other side
i mean valley of death thats pretty salty stuff
michael walks under the arch for the first time
thats why courage is tricky
should you always do what others tell you to do
sometimes you might not even know why youre doing something
i mean any fool can have courage
michael leans against the wall and tries to sleep
but honor thats the real reason you either do something or you dont
its who you are and maybe who you want to be
if you die trying for something important then you have both honor and courage and thats pretty good
bob sits at his desk reading michaels
as he turns to the last page
i think thats what the writer was saying
that you should try for courage and hope for honor
and maybe even pray that the people telling you what
to do have some too
bob visibly moved sets down the essay and smiles
graduation day and sean sits beside an empty seat in the quick filling auditorium
he sees leigh anne marching up the aisle a big smile on her face
she pushes down the row and plops down in the seat next to him
off seans look michaels final gpa
got it off pauls computer
he did it sean
he did it
sean grins then
wait a minute
you broke into the principals computer
she ignores him and opens her program letting sean know that is precisely what she did
paul sandstrom reads the names and the graduates move across the stage to get their diplomas
as each student walks across the stage a baby picture of their is projected
michael jerome oher
even though no one is supposed to clap a spontaneous round of applause gives michael pause as he accepts his diploma
projected behind him is a picture of the cutest african american infant the world has ever seen
whered you find a baby picture of michael
scanned it off an internet ad for a toddler boutique
off his look tell a soul and ill rip your tongue out
in the crowd the tuohys big tony miss sue bob and the other teachers all clap
michael diploma in hand shakes seans hand
sean moves close looks him in the eye
i want you to know something
youn me okay
i never believed you could do this
but you did
and im as proud of you as i am ashamed of myself
i should know better
ill never doubt you again michael
michael smiles nods gives leigh anne a little hug then raps knuckles with si and high fives collins
excuse me young man but i think i need a proper hug
he smiles and moves to her
off their embrace leigh anne and sean go over ole miss pamphlets with michael
youll be living in deaton hall here
youll have a meal plan and youll go to johnson commons to eat
johnson commons has all you can eat self serve ice cream
as much as you want
yep thats how mama put on her freshman ten
leigh anne rolls up a pamphlet and whacks him hard on her way to answer a ringing phone
this is mrs
as she listens she gives sean a look this isnt good
buttding hallway day leigh anne walks with michael
they just want to ask you a few questions
youve got nothing to hide michael
they arrive at a door open it
sits investigator granger in the room weve seen before
she rises professional but not smiling
my name is jocelyn granger and im the assistant director of enforcement for the ncaa
please call me leigh anne
leigh anne shakes her hand and she and michael move to the chairs
tuohy id prefer to speak with michael alone
how long will this take
michael starts rubbing his knees nervous as hell
michael ill be outside
leigh anne pecks his cheek and exits giving michael one last look before she leaves
leigh anne sits on a bench talking on the phone
ive got a bad feeling about this sean
this broad is tough
susies on the other line
what does the client want
but thats tacky
you know what fine if she wants her living room to look like a bordello make it happen
she hangs up checks her watch and looks toward the building
the interrogation is ongoing
your parents are friends with coach bert cotton correct
coach is a good guy
were you aware that coach cotton is accepting a job at ole miss
michael shakes his head and that this job offer came after you signed with them
no response from michael sean tuohy your legal guardian went to ole miss
he played basketball
tuohy attended ole miss as well
she was a cheerleader
is it safe to say that ole miss is their favorite school
do they like any other universities
what about say tennessee
they cant stand tennessee
so they wouldnt be happy if you chose to play football there
and your tutor
miss sue is an ole miss grad too
did miss sue try to persuade you to attend ole miss
did you know that the tuohys make generous donations to ole miss
that even miss sue makes donations
that the tuohys have a condo in oxford so they can attend as many athletic events as possible
that in fact sean and leigh anne tuohy are by our definition boosters
whats that mean
a booster is someone with an abnormal interest in a schools sports
someone who contributes financially to the universitys athletic program
michael doesnt answer just keeps rubbing his knees
then comes the part weve heard before
oher do you know why im here
do you know do you understand why im here
im here to investigate your odd
do you find it odd
she sifts through her briefcase pulls out files documents a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble michael is in
she sits back stares at michael as if trying to figure him out
michael cant meet her gaze
he looks out the window rubs his knees some more
can i leave now
michaels building up anxiety by the second
what do you want maam
what i want what my job is is to discern whether something untoward occurred in your recruitment to ole miss
i want the facts
i need the truth
i didnt lie
and i want to know what you think about all this
its the first time weve ever heard michael raise his voice
it echoes in the room
granger lets it die before she leans forward and continues
the ncaa fears that with your recruitment a door might be opened that boosters from lots of schools in the south will become legal guardians for young athletes without means
and funnel them to their alma maters
michael still doesnt get it shakes his head
im not saying i believe it and im not saying i dont but there are many people involved with this case who would argue that the tuohys took you in
fed you clothed you paid for your private education almost to himself no
bought you a car and paid for a tutor all as part of a plan to insure that you played football for the university of mississippi
now michael understands
he stares at the floor for a long time then quickly stands and makes for the door
michael were not finished
but hes gone
leigh anne sees michael exit the building
once hes outside he moves in circles gesticulating and talking to himself
leigh anne races over michael whats wrong
he looks at her glares really upset
whyd you do it
all along you wanted me to go to ole miss
well of course but
why did you do this for me
was it for you or was it for me
was it so i would go to school where you wanted
was it so i would do what you wanted
points to building thats what she thinks
is she right
her own words dont you dare lie to me
leigh anne digests this takes a breath
i can see where where some people might
her inability for the first time to articulate hits michael in the face
im not stupid
he turns and walks away
but she doesnt move just watches him go
sean and leigh anne sit at the kitchen table while collins and sj pace in the living room
on her cell well if he comes by there let me know
michael please call me and let me know youre okay
text him sj
keep it light
tell him youre gonna take his truck for a spin if he doesnt get in touch
sj starts texting
leigh anne and sean stare at each other
sean sits in bed and leigh anne paces
i should have followed him
you had no way of knowing hed disappear
was he right
off seans look what he said about us
leigh anne be sensible
we gave clothes to a boy who had one pair of shorts
we gave him a bed
to hell with the ncaa id do it again tomorrow
what about the rest of it all the stuff we did to make sure he got a scholarship
a scholarship to ole miss
he could go wherever he wanted he knew that
did you ask him
cause i know for sure i never did
sean considers this then beckons
come here honey
she moves to him
he puts his arm around her kisses her forehead
am i a good person
off his look not a joke
youre the best person i know
everything you do you do for others
why is that
with a smile i have not a clue
you obviously get some sick satisfaction from it
she looks at him
theres truth in his words
what if he never comes back
michael makes his way toward building c passing some of the same faces weve seen before
alton opens his door to make a transaction with an addictand spots michael
that you big mike
get your ass in here
im looking for moms
oh i seen dee dee around
she usually stop by for a taste around this time
tell you what ill get you a forty and well chop it up til she get here
alton smiles beckons
shitty but with good electronics
there are maybe eight people in the apartment partying drinking getting high
michael steps inside
alton points to a chair
a stoned out couple smokes on the adjacent couch
next to them an infant cries in a broken down crib
in the other corner of the room sits david the young man we met before
michael nods and david nods back
alton hands michael a beer
its good to see you big mike
you lookin fit
i heard you playin some ball
but you know that rich kid football aint like the public school league
people packing knives in their socks
back in the day i was a quarterback
you knew that right
yeah i heard

he with me now
ill open a spot for you too
got tired of going to class
always somebody tellin me what to do

david jumps up and cranks the volume on a rap song until the beat is bouncing off the walls
michael sips the beer rubs his knees
you stayin to the other side of town thats what dee dee said
said you got a new mama
she fine too
i seen her when she come to see dee dee
she came here
she got any other kids
she got a daughter

michael sets down the beer rises to leave
where you going
i wanna hear about your fine white sister
cause i like me some mommy daughter
alton steps in front of michael raises his hands shutup
you tellin me to shut up
illcap your fat ass
cap yourass drive east and pay a visittoyour cracker mama and her michael shoves him hard
alton unprepared for the force flies back against the wall
on the ground he reaches in his belt for his gun but just as he gets it out michael slaps it away
he picks up alton and throws him across the room
the party comes unhinged as michael grabs alton holds him against the wall with one hand while pounding him with the other
blood flies from altons face eighteen years of subdued rage coming out in seconds
two other guys grab michael from behind and one michael screams like a banshee spins grabs them and tackles them over the couch
an errant round fires into the ceiling
a table flies and the crib smashes
michael looks to david frozen in the corner then over to the screaming child on the floor
he grabs his head and heaves trying to make it all stop the music the screams the crying
the shots pulse to the music and
are intercut with michael age seven and several half brothers and sisters in front of hurt village as child protective services herds them away from denise oher
shes screaming the kids are crying
michael breaks away and runs to denise
he grabs her waist and is pulled away by an officer
the blind side yellow draft michael looks at the blood on his hands and shirt and stumbles out of the room terrified
leigh anne stands at the doorway to michaels empty very neat room
she stares missing everything about him
leigh anne drives around looking for michael at wingate
the streets of west side of memphis
and finally leigh anne approaches the complex
alton his face bandaged sits on the stoop with his crowd
a mother holds the unharmed baby
leigh anne stops looks to alton
but you tell him ill be seeing him around
you tell him hell get his
michael was here

so you tell him sleep with one eye open

she turns on her heels and strides to her car
when she gets in shes so nervous she hyperventilates
her phone rings and she opens the tiny purse revealing nothing more than a wallet and the phone
she recognizes the number and answers
the one where michael spent the night
he sits inside
leigh anne pulls up stops and they lock eyes
you think the police gonna come and get me
leigh anne sits on the curb with michael
id imagine the last thing anybody at hurt village wants is cops snooping around
after a beat i swore id never ask but

she shakes her head amazed at the kid
they stare out at the street then

but he just wanted to sit under a tree and smell the flowers

michael walks over to the car knocks on the window
she rolls it down dabbing tears from her eyes

she gets out of the car and holds him for a long time
i read a story the other day about a boy from the projects
no daddy in and out of foster care
hed been killed in a gang fight at hurt village
a newspaper photo of a dead boy from the
then another headline another young black face
another and another until the last headline shows a photo of david altons minion his face full of shining promise
in the last paragraph they talked about his superb athletic skills and how different his life might have been if he hadnt fallen behind and dropped out of school
he was twenty one years old the day he died
it was his birthday
lonely falling apart
that could have been anyone
it could have been my son michael
beautiful on a fall day
and then the still comes to life and michael books in hand enters frame walking
its like the other michael crowd shots with one difference this time he moves at the same speed as everyone else
but it wasnt
and i suppose i have god to thank for that

and very content
she closes her eyes
