screenplay by kristine johnson jessie nelson were watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets blue equal packets and pink sweet and low into small containers
with precision and lightning speed the mixed up colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little color coded rows
wait this container has three equals and four sweet n lows
the hand quickly plucks the mutant sweet n low
we move up those hands and meet sam dawson as he surveys his domain
something about him
hes extremely compelling uniquely handsome
but its more than that
those eyes they sparkle with the wonder of a child
lifes cynical edge has not etched its path across this face
they light on a coffee cup held by one of the regulars
double double decaf low fat cap
you got it buddy
good choice very good choice
sam moves along commenting to customers as he places sweet n lows on tables the self appointed host of starbucks
mocha rumba frappuccino no whipped half low half non
very good choice
he stops in front of sale mugs and turns them so that the logos all face the same way
his boss george approaches
sam they called
its time for you to go
sam freezes but doesnt turn around
sam did you hear me
its time for you to go
without another word sam walks straight out the door
sam still in his white apron walks down the busy street
he has a fast loping gait that doesnt slow or hesitate for anyone
a couple argue on the sidewalk
sam walks right its time
sam keeps moving he crosses the street without stopping
traffic screeches to a halt
cars honk a taxi driver yells
its time its time for you to go
sam plows down the hall and comes to room
sam pushes the door open
and we realize we are entering a rebecca is in the middle of a major contraction
her face is the opposite of sams
she lets out a scream that stops sam dead in his tracks
gertie a no nonsense black nurse looks up from the monitor
you the one responsible for this
sam nods taking gertie quite literally
too late for sorries daddy get over here and hold her hand
sam reaches for rebeccas hand
she pulls it away
another contraction rebecca screams
you got a live one gert
okay this is it
spins in circles this is it
this is it
and its a girl
the baby lets out her first cry
sam watches awestruck
gertie wraps the baby in a blanket and holds her out to rebecca
rebecca shakes her head not now
gertie walks over to sam
theres someone whos been waitin an awful long time to see you sam
she places the baby into sams arms
suddenly sams whole body relaxes and becomes very still
he looks to rebecca but she has turned away
he meets gerties eyes
then in quiet amazement this is it
whats her name
looks at clock let me see let me see let me see
lucy in the sky with diamonds
recorded march nd
lyrics by john lennon music by paul mccartney
lucy diamond dawson
we hear like a lullaby picture yourself on a boat in a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies
sam holding the baby and becca having just checked out walk down the steps of the hospital holding their complimentary plastic baby bag
sam is nervous haling the precious cargo and becca is agitated
they see the bus pulling up and down the street and sam moves quickly so they can hurry and catch it
as he approaches the bus he looks to becca by his side but she is not there
he looks around and no sign of her
frantically turning in a full circle he sees the fabric of her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street
the more he screams the faster she moves away
till theres no trace of her
sam stands in the middle of the busy block holding lucy to his chest devastated
we hear look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes but shes gone
sam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest
next to him is the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers two cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk
sam is surrounded by passengers the eerie world of the underground at night
instinctively sam holds her even tighter two against the world
a marvel of organization
a closet reveals clothes on hangers exactly equidistant from each other precisely folded t shirts underwear and socks organized by color
a carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift bookshelves
beatles posters from every era decorate the walls
beccas things sit in one corner
an island of chaos in an hold everything showroom
the kitchen counter has been transformed into a changing table
bottles and pacifiers lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers
underneath a clothes line of baby clothes
the sound of a crying baby breaks the silence
the camera follows and finds the cradle a drawer tucked snugly into a blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs
an exhausted sam pops up from his bed behind the hammock
he swings the hammock hoping against hope the baby will go back to sleep
didnt you just fall asleep little girl
lucy cries harder okay if you say its time to get up then its time to get up time to get up
sam sniffs the air oh my oh my oh my
quite a bit of business
he rushes over to the kitchen counter and unsnaps the babys pajamas revealing a cloth diaper held together with promotional buttons one says hertz for car rentals the other a
picture of magic johnson and reads go lakers go
sam undoes it
oh my god oh my god oh my god
let me see let me see let me see
sam attempts to clean and diaper her
he finally manages to pin the buttons so that it at least stays on
you look very beautiful this morning very beautiful
he holds her up and the diaper falls down around her ankles
we pan across a row of diapers on a supermarket shelf sam stares at the great wall of diapers awed
he reaches for the pampers balancing lucy then the luvs no the huggies
sam stops moving lucy starts crying so he jogs in place
sam decides on one of each
he heads to the formula aisle
gerber carnation carnation iron fortified
we hear the song help i need somebody sam paces carrying lucy who screams at the top of her lungs
sam rocks the crying baby in the hammock
hes exhausted but shes just getting started
he puts another blanket on her
a punch drunk sam lays the sleeping baby into the cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate
he tiptoes his fist raised victoriously yes
he doesnt get two steps before lucy wakes screaming
defeated he picks her up
the phone rings
he presses speaker
what the hell are you doing to that baby
he looks out his window and sees annie cassell his neighbor on the phone watching him through her window
she is a strange creature with very thick glasses
we sense a uniquely profound intelligence behind all that armor
everythings so tiny tiny
wont you please come over
i need somebody
wont you please please help me
you know i cant do that
what does her mother say
her mother said this isnt my life
im outta here when she comes
it didnt mean anything sam
it was just one night
the two of you
thats all i need
annie what if shes sick
annie has her door open a crack
annie feels the babys forehead
lucy stares up at her quiet now fascinated
shes overheated and not eating enough
how often are you feeding her
a lot gerber carnation gerber
whats a lot
breakfast lunch and dinner
three squares hot
babies need food every two hours sam
im sorry lucy diamond
what time does the little diamond wake up
she never really goes to sleep
well lets assume shes up at six
keep your tv on nickelodeon
i want you to feed her first while bewitched is on
then again when hogans heroes starts
after that well until father knows best
we are watching hogans heroes
we hear shultzs infamous response i know nothing absolutely nothing
sam feeds a content lucy
father knows best on tv
lucy blissfully falls asleep in sams arms
euphoric he tiptoes to the cradle and places her ever so gently when suddenly the front door flies open
sams best friends descend inside ifty a pakistani gentlemen with a gentle face and a wide smile carrying a large stuffed giraffe with a bow on it
brad who sees himself as a real ladies man in tight jeans and a farrah fawcett t shirt and robert highly paranoid thinks the worlds out to get him
sam runs to the crib
what are you doing here now
her first sound sleep not a sound not a sound
eight years every thursday video night and you forgot
oh my god video night
first thursday of the month
video night at sams house
im sorry i forgot
gone with the wind is a very sad movie
oh here we go
everything changes now
soon youll forget about wednesday night dennys and friday night karaoke
and i got hit by a car today
its probably that guy from the v
closing window i cant discuss it
and now this
ifty makes origami birds out of newspapers
she looks smart doesnt she
of course look
shes already reading the newspaper
i have five smart sisters in pakistan
i am only brother
seven brides for seven brothers was a wonderful movie i forgot to bring last week for video night
did you get blade runner for tonight
now its all my fault
dont tell me you forgot again
i broke a date with a daydream to come here
theres a knock at the door
ifty goes to get it
brad moans when he sees his year old mother estelle standing in the doorway
i told you video nights over at nine
its only six thirty
unaware of the baby sorry
ill wait in the lobby
lucy begins to cry
brad takes her like a hot potato robert takes her now ifty runs around in circles
she needs motion
my father drove my sisters in his taxi to get them to go to sleep
two fifty surcharge on all taxis from the airport
i got hit by a taxi on tuesday
and it all starts again and we an empty bus makes its way through the city at night
main and temple
she out yet
the camera moves along and stops on the long seat at the back
sam lies with lucy spooned into the crook of his arm almost asleep
almost there almost there
one more round and shell be down for the night
we hear the song golden slumbers
in a series of dissolves we see lucy and sam in different sleeping positions on the bus seat
gradually she grows in his one month then two
shes big and round at six months
and on and on into the night
we see sam and lucy crammed into the booth wearing birthday hats taking her first birthday picture
we see the photo strip as it comes out of the slot
sams shoulder with lucys ear lucys nose with sams elbow their faces never made it into the picture
the place is packed
sam moves from table to table cleaning
double macciatto low foam low fat
good choice very good choice
sam turns and we see lucy attached to him in a handmade snugly crocheted by annie
she faces outward all hands all months of her too big for the snugly
she grabs a croissant from a customer
george looks confused
then makes a swipe for a customers coffee knocking it to the ground
it splatters all over an anorexic on her fourth double latte woman in a designer exercise outfit
she begins shrieking
george looks at sam this cant go on
sam lucy by his side has his foot in annies door
shes too big to take to work
im not a baby sitter
im too busy
annie annie annie
suspicious did you teach her that
it was her first word
very first word
annie opens the door takes lucys hand and pulls her in
and people worry youre not smart
the apartment looks like a fallout shelter
the kitchen contains enough canned goods to last a year
brightly colored crocheted doilies annies hobby adorn every available surface
the brightly colored web of an lucy sits in annies lap getting her first piano lesson
we see lucys tiny fingers on the keys
in a series of dissolves it is joined by annies hand tapping out one note now two notes and as the weeks pass a chord
until finally the notes merge to become the most unlikely duet of twinkle twinkle little star
this is mozart
he did twenty two variations of twinkle twinkle little star
you smell good
you can tell a lot about a person by their smell
if theyve got too much perfume on theyre covering something up
you gotta watch someone who smells like soap
gotta wonder what their priorities are
people who try too hard
they smell like fish
you smell like milk
milk and hope
lucy leaves the piano and toddles over to annies loom and plays with a ball yarn
annie opens the door to pull in the groceries
the ball of yarn rolls out the door and lucy chases after it
annie terrified bellows lucy
come back here
it becomes obvious annie cant walk outside
trembling lucy in the sky with diamonds
hearing the familiar tune lucy stops and toddles back
annie sweeps her up relieved and we sam on stage with ifty and brad as his back up singers continuing the song in the oddest most heartfelt version to lucy
who sits on roberts lap and in heaven
a beautiful blue sky
and lucy in the sky with diamonds continues as lucys three year old laughing face swings into frame on a swing then disappears out the other end of frame
now lucy swings back down and out of the other end again
sams face glowing with delight appears against the sky and then disappears
sam and lucy are on swings surrounded by mothers and kids at the park
daddy where does the sky end
let me see let me see
ive never been there but they say its somewhere near china
lucy flies into frame now four sitting on sams lap swinging
are lady bugs only girls or are there boys too
and if there are what are they called
then lucy flies into frame now five followed by sam
do i look more like you or mommy
he knew this moment would come
lucy and sam are having a serious talk over breaded sole
if you and mommy liked each other enough to have me how come youre not together anymore
i think she fell out of love with me
not you never you
me just me
when you fall out of love where do you land
somewhere in florida i think
do you think shell ever come back
long pause paul mccartney lost his mother when he was fourteen
john lost his mother twice
first when julie gave john to her sister mimi to raise
and then again when julia was hit by a car
they say god picks certain people special people
thats what they say
lucy takes this in
sam begins to shift his tomatoes just so
his potatoes just slightly to the left
daddy did god mean for you to be like this or was it an accident
do you mean what do you mean
i mean youre different
what do you mean
i mean what do you mean
youre not like the other daddies
im not am i
dont be sorry
nobody elses daddy ever comes to the park
filled with relief
bursting with love
we are very lucky arent we
grace approaches with two plates of pie ice cream on the side
ice cream on the side
not on top
not on top
very good choice
brad i know it was your turn
im sure of it
i swear to god it was roberts turn
why is it always my fault
i keep track last time i say to myself i say write it down
bank of america give away beautiful calendar every month a picture of wild animal look june an elk
she starred in the remake of prisoner of zenda
three stars leonard maltin video movie guide
as they go on lucy matter of factly pulls a video out of her backpack and puts it in the vcr
she turns it on
its kramer vs
everyone stops their arguing and stares at lucy
annie let me borrow it
a row of brand new childrens shoes on display
lucy tries on dozens of school shoes surrounded by sam and her godfathers ifty brad and robert
you need a good sturdy school shoe
arches are very important
sturdy is boring
red shoes bring good luck
but red doesnt got with green
except on christmas
no brown clodhoppers
everyone will make fun of her
no one will make fun of lucy
she might be stupid
no shes not did they test her
you dont know for sure
yes i do
but if she is dont make her go to school
dont let her in the lunch room
johnny marzetties there
get her a pass
the rules for volleyball are so hard to remember
rotate rackman rotate
throw the ball at his forehead and the water on his brain will come out his nose
meanwhile lucy has been trying on a simple brown shoe
i like these
she know what she likes
she likes these
how much are they
forty nine ninety nine
one penny less than fifty
these shoes are one penny less than fifty
its okay dad
i dont really like them
no no no no no
well all give ten dollars
ive only got three plus five
but i need one for stamps
dont pull your wad out in front of people
they all dig in their pockets and begin counting very slowly
thank you thank you
we are rich in friends
thats what our fortune cookie said
quarters that makes one
ill count it
is it enough
exasperated if theres a god
do we get a balloon with these
all of us or just her
those new little brown shoes walking in between four pairs of mans shoes
we move up from those shoes to see five pair of hands tightly clasping their balloons as they march victoriously down the street
we move in on lucys little brown shoes skipping with joy and those same little shoes in the midst of a mass of black soccer cleats
we move up and see lucy in the middle of a fierce kids soccer game
the ball comes to lucy
she kicks and misses
from the sidelines we hear beautiful kick
lucy looks up at her dad proudly
the ball comes again
nobody could miss this one
but lucy does
theyre getting scared now
the game continues
the goalies father duncan rhodes handsome commanding and dressed in a suit calls to his son cmon conner
on your toes
theyre all counting on you
conner tenses up alert under the pressure
meanwhile down at the other end the ball heads toward lucy
she kicks it
right into her teams own goal
the crowd groans
youre getting the hang of it now
youve got them scared now
lucys bursting with confidence plows toward the ball and nails it
the ball goes flying
the parents in the stand are completely baffled
sam is completely ecstatic
l u c y
thats our battlecry
the ball heads into the goal just passing the goalie conner
sam runs to embrace lucy when he hears duncan reaming his son the whole game was right in front of your nose
i leave work early to watch you blow the whole game
conner slouches against the fence as his father walks away
seeing this sam whispers to lucy
a childs hand double jumps across a checker board
lucy and conner are playing checkers while sam cooks dinner
two carrots cut into ten pieces
bow tie pasta pieces each
whats wrong with your father
whys he acting like a retard
their hands graze against each other on the check board he pulls his hand away
are you sure
how do you know
he told me
but hes a retard
yeah well it takes one to know one
he crowns her her eyes shift to sam in the kitchen for the first time a bit uneasily
sams reading lucy her homework book
they perched in sisisi
silence for a long time
your teacher chose a hard book this time
how can we be so difdifdif
sam glances up at lucy self consciously
lucy grabs the book from sam tosses it on the pile and picks up another
i dont like that book lets read green eggs and ham
relieved sam plunges into the book which is more memorized than read
i am sam sam i am
do you like green eggs and ham
i do not like them sam i am
they both laugh delighted
lucy looks sleepy
lucy is getting drowsy
sam is just getting started
and i will eat them here and there
say i will eat them anywhere
i do so like green eggs and ham thank you thank you sam i am
one more time
daddy i have school tomorrow
i dont wanna be too sleepy
just the part about the boat and the goat in the rain in the train
daddy hamburger hamlet has twelve different kinds of hamburgers
can we go there wednesday instead of dennys
but wednesday nights dennys thursdays video night friday night karaoke
lucy nods a little deflated
how about one more time just the beginning
i am sam sam i am
lucy sighs and closes her eyes against her fathers chest
lucy draws a picture while everyone reads aloud from lucy your turn
start where sara left off
sure you can
they perched in sisisisi
throws down book there
i told you
its too hard
i know you can read this
no i cant
and you cant make me
lucy runs out of the class
sam in sunglasses waits for the bus
a young woman lily sits down next to him
the wind catches her floral dress thats just left of innocent just right of alluring
she reads a tabloid
premature baby claims hes cupid has the arrow to prove it
do you believe that
well if he has the arrow
you got a good point
she crosses her legs
a tuft of pink dress falls on sams knee
youre a good reader
yeah ive always been smart
im looking for a smart good mother
i can be a mother
a real good mother
i could even spank you
oh no no no
i dont believe in that
i can be very gentle
do you tell stories
i got stories up the wazoo

ill tell you a nice story
i have to pick up lucy at annies first
a menage a toi
french french the language of france
you could teach my daughter lucy
cant you pick her up after
no no lucy comes too
she takes sams hand they move to get on the bus just as another hand brusquely lands on theirs
not so fast
youre under arrest
he wanted to bring his kid i said no
a lightbulb flashes and we sam blinks as his mugshot is being taken
now the profile
he turns so they can get the back of his head
now the now sam in the corner of the room on the phone making thumbprints on the wall
while the cop discusses his case with a social worker margaret brown
over the years shes seen it all and to get through it has had to pretend its just a job
its the first time in nineteen years i actually believe the guy when he says he didnt know she was a hooker you say that like its a good thing
your teeth dont sound like they were brushed
do it with me now
let him go
he says hes never spent a night away from his kid
come with me i got a guy who beat the shit out of his two year old
her cell phone beeps
i am seeing you tomorrow mr
shes still screaming
no mcdonalds wont help
shes four months old
not on the gum line not on the gum line
margaret watches sam as he talks to lucy on the phone
the walls are lined with childrens art
various interpretations of the family
we stop at one of a very small man and a very big little girl with her arm around him
it gives us a great deal of insight into what she must be feeling
and in the classroom its becoming clear shes holding herself back
its as if shes literally afraid to learn
we pull back and see sam staring at the picture
wright and the principal watch him
no one doubts that you love your daughter mr
but the department of social services contacted us
they shared with us that your records show that your intellectual capacity is around that of a seven year old
our concern is what happens when lucy turns eight
dawson do you understand what miss wright is trying to tell you about lucy
no one wanted the beatles to break up
but you can hear it on the white album
they were going in different directions
sam and lucy are reading from stellaluna
how can we be so dif
i dont know that word
yes you do
it starts with a d im tired
i dont believe you
are you calling me a liar
now read the word
no youre not
i dont want to read it if you cant
it makes me happy
im happy hearing you read it
he holds the book open for lucy
now lucy pushing through a mountain of resistance reads
and reads beautifully
why are we different and so much alike
two children dressed as batman march followed by cinderella
we see lucy dressed in newspaper an origami bird
and behind her marching more proudly than any child is sam dressed as paul mccartney in the black suit era with beatle boots and guitar strapped to his chest
sam is the only adult participating in the parade
music blasts over the loudspeaker
sam begins to dance with joyous abandon
lucy joins him
they dance together happily
suddenly lucy becomes aware that her classmates are beginning to laugh
she slows and watches through their eyes sam pony around the room
conner pulls up his pants high on his waist and begins to imitate sam
another kid joins him
im a super freak
and i thought my dad was a dork
lucys face hardens for the first time
in a corrupt world the pure can only stay pure for so long
sam and lucy sit in a booth
they have eleven different kinds of hamburgers
this is so great
a new place
i said wed go to a new place
and here we are
sam anxiously rearranges the condiments on the table
lucy tries to fold a napkin into an origami bird
you know what else i want for my birthday daddy
i want a hundred birds
the napkins are much stiffer at dennys
they make better birds
theres not so much stuff on the tables there either
why do they have two kinds of mustard on every table
no no coffee
sams system cant handle coffee
what can i get you folks
id like the benito bandito burger and a chocolate chip milkshake please
ill have the fish special side of potatoes salad with thousand island dressing cherry pie and
im sorry sir
we dont have a fish special
theres fish and chips
it comes with a dinner salad
you mean potato chips
i dont want potato chips
i want a side of potatoes
you want french fries
no a side of potatoes like at dennys
a side of potatoes
theyre little red potatoes
we dont have new potatoes
dennys has new potatoes
six new potatoes parsley garnish parsley garnish
her smile fades
sam happily eats his fish special with six new potatoes
lucys untouched dinner sits in the middle of the table
she doodles on the placement drawing a man sitting with a pile of new potatoes in front of him larger than he is
fish and chips fish and chips
i will not eat fish and chips
exploding i will not eat them here or there
i will not eat them anywhere
i will not eat green eggs and ham
i will not eat them sam i am
balloons and a banner reading happy birthday lucy
for lucys birthday sam has rented a moon bounce which sits in the center of the apartment and filling the entire place leaving no room for the few kids and
brad stands too close to a young attractive mother
robert shakes all the presents suspiciously
now when they come through the door everybody yell surprise
do you want to rehearse again
i bet she already knows
i didnt tell her
did brad say i did
theres a knock at the door
is that lucy
annies supposed to call and warn us
brad hits the lights
sam opens the door and everyone yells surprise
but instead of lucy its the social worker
i dont know if you remember me
im margaret brown from childrens social services
we met at the police station
put your present over there hurry up
lucy might be on her way
the phone rings hello
annie says shes coming up the stairs
everyone be quiet
assume surprise positions
conner keeps talking be quiet
assume surprise positions
why are you such a party pooper
assume surprise positions
sam puts a hand over conners mouth conner struggles against him
hes gonna ruin the surprise
hes gonna ruin the surprise
he touched me
ive got cooties
ive got cooties
get your hands off my boy
conners father hurls sam across the room sam gets tangled in the moon bounce
to get attention conner bursts into tears
we hear footsteps outside the door brad hits the lights
we hear a crash
and in the light the door sheds as it opens lucy and ifty see that moonbounce swaying
then from within the moonbounce surprise
lucy stands frozen holding a red balloon
you dont have to call him daddy
in sams face she says youre not her real father anyway
humiliated lucy runs away
the social worker watches profoundly concerned and reaches for her cellular phone
a police car pulls into the parking lot
sam and margaret in the back
sam and margaret see lucys little feet dangling from beneath the curtain of the photo booth
ill go get her
it would be better if you stay here
im sorry to say this mr
dawson its clear how much you love your daughter but were going to have to remove lucy from your home
one cop places his hand on sams shoulder restraining him
the other heads toward the photo booth
no no no no
its her birthday
its her birthday
i know how hard this must be
cell phone rings hello betsy
im scheduled to come to your apartment at four
no not five every two hours
its two every five hours
she only weighs thirty pounds for chrissakes
back to sam the city has given me the difficult task of deciding when to intervene on behalf of the child
unfortunately ive learned the hard way that its better too soon than too late
for now the court will decide whats in lucys best interest
sam watches the cops legs meet lucys under the curtain
suddenly sam screams from the deepest core of his being
run lucy run
we see lucys feet kick the cops legs and wrestle out of his grasp
she flies out the booth holding that balloon
she runs down the street the balloon soaring into the sky a cop follows
reeling devastated we hear a judge speaking given the fact that the father was arrested for solicitation did not cooperate with the police
sam sits alone
at another table margaret brown and a lawyer along with several people from the cps
could not control his emotions endangering other children
miss brown also cites mr
dawsons mental deficiencies which raise serious questions about his ability to properly parent
i agree to grant petition
the child shall be removed from the home until a forma jurisdictional hearing
dawson is there anything youd like to add
i just wanted it to be a nice surprise party
i had gotten the plates at pic n save
pink and yellow pink and yellow
like a princess
and the balloons at gently mr
dawson it sounds like a lovely party but right now i want to talk to you about your legal rights
i would strongly suggest you get yourself legal counsel and allow your attorney to present your case at the jurisdictional hearing on february th
counsel are you available
ted i have a trial that day
panicking twenty two days
lucy will come home and you want me to bring lucy back in twenty two days
youll have supervised visits twice a week for two hours
now im sorry we have thirty more cases to see today
sams on the phone a teddy bear in his hand
robert ifty and brad all sit with yellow pages open in front of them
today is monday mrs
thats three days away
thats too long
she cant sleep without mr
well if youre not available until thursday maybe i could see her without you there
maybe the judge made a mistake maybe he doesnt know that for seven years i played with her without you there
brown im not trying to violate the court
the other line hangs up mrs
i bet they were recording the whole conversation
check your phone
you cant make a move
you need a lawyer
call jerry spence
he has his own show
he must know what hes doing
he has his own show too
he can even get a guilty person off
so you think im guilty
you didnt kill anybody
but she said im not her father
she didnt say that
that runty kid with the blue shirt and the mean father whose voice sounds like the man on the channel four news who has a toupee
toupees are expensive
she said it
but she didnt mean it
i said i hated my mother once
once upon a time
is how stories begin
you should get a personal injury lawyer
youve been personally injured
here look at this sebastion gibson
he can do anything
back and neck
the social worker said its a custody case
then get a divorce lawyer
when dustin hoffman was trying to keep billy from going back to meryl streep his lawyer said it was going to cost him fifteen thousand dollars and thats if we
fifteen thousand dollars
dont worry about money now
get the best
century city here rubel bly harrison and williams
a century city lawyer spins in front of our eyes
its sams pov as he sits in a chair that spins in the center of rita harrisons lavish penthouse office
now we see the panoramic of los angeles
now the dots in the lichtenstein on the wall whirl past us
now the door swings open and rita harrison and her assistant burst in
rita moves in opposite circles around the room
looking for something
in fact as we watch rita we realize that she never stops moving
ten steps ahead of anyone too much energy too much caffeine not enough food
if she slowed down a beat she might get vulnerable
cant have that

cant really look you in the eye
cant help it if shes smarter than anyone else in the room

she unconsciously digs through the bowl of jelly beans on her desk sorting out all the yellow ones
dawson what im trying to say is im a divorce lawyer and as much as id like to i dont handle cases like yours since you would like to why
dont you talk to your boss
maybe he would let you
she pours the bowl of jelly beans onto her desk now frantically sorting through them
into phone then keep dialing to sam what i mean is that at this point in my career i cant afford to
i earn eight dollars an hour at starbucks
i can pay your hourly rate rate by the hour hourly rita stands up ushering him to the door
dawson im sorry i have to be in court in eight minutes with the kresges
you understand good luck to you and dont give up
she turns ahhhh
she begins searching the room
where are my keys
where the hell are my keys
replaying i walked into the room i went over here i looked at my desk i put my coat down patricia
wheres my coat
is there a child involved in mr
stunned rita looks up and sees sam holding up a strip of photos taken at the birthday booth
this is lucy
one year old
first word apple
out of his pocket he pulls another photo strip
heres lucy two years old
first merry go round ride
seven years old
the day the police took her away
rita looks at the photo strip of lucys birthday
in the first three we see lucys sad face
the fourth has a cops face smashed into the frame with her
thank you for telling me not to give up
i wont give up
through the phone danny on line
rita lunges for the phone
could we possibly talk about this when i get home
youre not gonna talk to me
i bought you a bag of your favorite lemonade jelly beans
rita starts singing one little bird in one little tree were all alone and we dont want to be
so they flew far away over the trees
i said over the sea
i know the words i said over the sea
since when dont you like that song
she checks her watch puts him on the speaker phone and frantically searches the room for her keys
we hear six loud thuds the sound of a basketball bouncing against the floor
the line goes dead
rita trips over the coffee table completely losing it
i hate this stupid coffee table how many times have i asked you to get rid of this crappy coffee table
she kicks it sending the lemonade jelly beans flying
then after a beat
from the doorway you did say over the trees instead of over the sea
its hard to remember all the words to all the songs
theres so many
rita almost stops you have a child rita rubel bly harrison williams
if they took him away wouldnt you hire the fastest talking four named lawyer you could
yes i would
i went to college with a friend who does these kinds of cases

a group of ritas colleagues are celebrating a big win
rita is backing out of the room with her glass of champagne
i am celebrating congratulations to us these are the moments good night
she stops stunned as she sees sam sitting in the lobby holding out a starbucks cappuccino
non fat vente cap
im sorry to bother you but did you call your friend
ritas confused your friend from college your friend who does this kind of work
there never was a friend i dont have her number anymore sam
we lost touch
devastated oh that happens
people lose touch
will you call me if you find it
if you get back in touch
yes im just in the middle
its a special
ill call you
to avoid any further interaction she heads back to the employee party she previously escaped from
sam walks down the hall
is that the new janitor
no its a case
sort of a pro bono thing
her assistant patricia clears her throat
whats that supposed to mean
a cracker went down the wrong pipe
muffled laughter from her colleagues
you think i dont pro bono
i can do pro bono
i can do goddamn pro bono
where the hell are my keys
hold the door
rita runs to the open elevator and comes face to face with sam whos been holding the door open for her
the door closes
rita is trapped with sam
she stares forward trying to will him not there
rita gulps her champagne
and on and on and on
rita is about to spontaneously combust
finally g rita bolts out the elevator doors then just as suddenly turns around
alright alright ill take you
alright goddammitt ill take you
oh my god oh my god
rubel bly harrison and williams
sam shaking with relief pulls out his wallet just as the elevator door starts closing
no no no
the doors close
we hear from within as sam goes up again yes
i liked sonny bono too
sam stares out the window at an unfamiliar neighborhood
on his lap the pink box now ripped allowing us to see lucys birthday cake
its lopsided from having been thawed and refrozen
sam waits for his transfer
he sets the cake down on the bench and takes out a piece of paper with directions written on it
the number bus pull sup and sam consults his paper once more before jumping on forgetting the cake
the bus goes half a block before it screeches to a halt
sam jumps off and runs back for the cake but the bus continues on its way
moments later the number bus pulls up
flustered and worried about being late sam jumps on
he feels something cold on his hand looks down the box is starting to leak ice cream
lucy margaret a therapist and a child psychologist wait for sam
lucy im sorry
but it doesnt look like hes going to make it
staring forward hell be here
you smell like soap
lucy hes an hour and minutes late
youll only have a few minutes left
suddenly through the door comes sam carrying the melted dripping birthday cake
lucy runs to him
i told you i told you
margaret the therapist ms
geller and the child pscyhologist all write voraciously into note pads as they observe sam and lucy who sit in the center of the room nervous under their scrutiny
and shes a century city lawyer a very famous lawyer
guess what her name is
jaw drops lovely rita meter maid
just like george
they move to hug each other
everyone reaches for their pens
sam pulls back self consciously
everyone writes even harder
your ears are larger
and your eyes are older
her eyes are older
he hugs her all the pens im gonna get a phone machine
if im not home you can leave a message
hi this is lucy
you cant afford a phone machine
the writing starts again
yes we can
im in line for a promotion
a promotion thats big
theyre gonna let you make coffee
set your dreams high lucy
lucy looks at her father lovingly
im sorry daddy
it was all my fault
dont say that
i wouldnt want any daddy but you
she looks around to see if anybodys writing
she suddenly screams at them i said i was sorry
i said i didnt want any daddy but him
why dont you write that down
we hear sobbing and see rita sitting across from a very rich very angry couple
ritas foot is twitching furiously
are you telling me that neither of you want custody of your child
hes created a monster
hes exactly like him
the woman is distracted by a loud thumping on ritas glass wall its sam
holding an envelope
very distressed as the secretary attempts to corral him back into the lobby
i am right here with you excuse me
she unlocks door sam
didnt i tell you that you have to call
you know how to make an appointment
its thats ridiculous you can always get patricia
ill see you next week
but its an emergency lots of three syllable words urgent open at once
he hands the letter to rita
rita looks through the glass wall at her clients who are getting impatient
they want to have you and lucy evaluated by a shrink
the appointment is today at three
i know and i want you to object
sam i cant object
its court ordered
sam notices that the woman in ritas office is crying
he walks in and hands her a handkerchief from his pocket
dont be sad
she looks at him as if hes from mars
rita now outside her office watches sam now inside the office
patricia im in the middle get him out of there she quickly gets up but ritas too impatient and pushes past her into the office
sam come with me
to the couple were gonna get through this excuse us
to sam sam this is their turn now
if you leave now youll never make it and you have to make it
okay okay i know i take the bus and transfer to the
than the downtown express to wilshire then rita looks at the couple leaving her office
redefining road rage ritas slamming the horn
sam next to her
green means red means stop yellow in the middle means no no no
i dont like shrinks
ive seen too many shrinks
you and me both
right or left which will it be you idiot
your mother sent you to shrinks too
well sort of
i talk about her the whole time im there
did you notice that everyone else is driving slower
i noticed that did you
on the horn go for chrissakes
how about your mother
maybe she can help you shes gone
shes at the park lane mortuary
two from the left
under the big tree
the light is green
she cuts around the car in front of her flips him off and in a split second that her head is turned almost smashes into the car in front of
she slams on the brakes
too many shrinks
im sorry mrs
dawson if i were you i wouldnt waste any more time
im sorry mrs
dawson it must be a tremendous disappointment
im sorry mrs
dawson i think youd both be happier if sam was in a home
rita looks over at sam forced to stop
sam sits across from a shrink ms
geller nervously straightening her desk
dawson you do understand that since i am a court appointed psychologist the traditional client therapist confidentiality will be waived
sam looks confused mr
dawson do you understand that the confidentiality will be waived
sam nods nervously and waves
with that she begins
sam ifty brad and robert hover over a used answering machine
ifty pours over the instructions
before you read your message press the red button for record when you finish press the yellow button
if you press the green button it will play it back you
lets start with the ogm
hello i am sam
i didnt press the red button
false start false start

hi how are you
the tape runs out
that was pretty good
that was natural
did i sound like a good father
its the outgoing message
you need to sound more outgoing
lets start again
kerry unlocks the phone and dials
she hands the phone to lucy who waits eagerly in her pjs
sams answering machine clicks on as if on slow speed
hi its lens auto body shop
wed love to show you our body work but its invisible
leave it at the beep
you must have dialed the wrong number
rita and sam walk through the lobby at ritas olympic pace
she passes the elevator and heads for the stairs
look weve got a lot to go over and ive got five minutes
pointing to elevator rubel bly harrison and williams thirty second floor thirty two floors up
rita heads up the stairs
we hear a beep
rita checks her heart rate watch
starts walking up the stairs
gotta get to one twenty five to make it count
okay okay okay
im gonna need that list of people who can testify that youre a good father despite your handicap
i didnt mean your handicap i meant your disability i mean the fact that youre retarded
thats not the right word
what do i call you

rita looks at sam as she bounds up the fourth floor
yes you are
he hands her a list her cell hello ted how you doing whattaya mean whats that supposed to mean

a look of horror falls across her face
she does a and starts running down the stairs reading the list
were making progress
three character witnesses
thats a good start
what does ifty bhutto do
he works in a bank
tripping down the stairs excellent
ifty sits across from rita who attempts to take notes
sam is a very concerned father
he always saves his money at bank of america
last year there was a lion on the calendar
this year a gazelle
the gazelle is national bird of tunisia
we have clients not customers
at bank of america
bank on us
he looks up at her lost
so is she
what was the question again please
who sits across from rita
she tape records him
he always made a point of feeding her breakfast when bewitched was on and lunch when jeopardy was on so shed be smart
is that wonderbra youre wearing
because you look wonderful
robert sits across from rita who records him
how long have you and sam why are you recording this
its often necessary who are you really
im whats that supposed to mean
lets i need to talk to my lawyer
rita maniacally picks the frosting off a donut
patricia get mr
dawson on the line
over her intercom we hear sams answering machine
hi its lens auto body shop i need this like a call him at starbucks no i dont know which starbucks
theres forty two between here and the end of the block
rita stands next to her porsche
there are starbucks in every direction she looks
sam is straightening sweet and lows
rita barrels in
look i dont think you understand what youre up against we have to be in court in three days and we dont have a decent witness
now youve gotta know someone who can testify whos been to college or has a degree of some kind or some sort of way of expressing themselves thats gonna make
the court believe that you deserve to get your daughter back i need a coffee

oh honey nobody notices
they opened a lane
too loudly do you want it here or to go
dial tone dorothy
no no no i didnt stare at the eczema for five months for she takes out her car beeper clicks it towards the window and realizes that theyre towing her
annie is at the piano lost in a beethoven concerto
annie its one day
maybe only minutes
lucy needs you
annie keeps playing you went to college
you can give the right answers
annie plays even harder
frustrated he pounds the piano
we cant lose her
id make it worse for you
i cant do it
dont you think i would if i could
we hear a voice all rise for the honorable judge phillip mcneily
sam stands along with others in the courtroom
the judge enters and sits
everyone else sits now too
who continues to stand until rita pulls him down
now we see ifty robert brad and brads mother who sits several seats behind brad knitting
robert holds up a handmade sign from the back of the courtroom free lucy dawson
turner the prosecuting attorney examines his first witness
hes disheveled but dont let the rumpled suit fool you
this man is razor sharp
the therapist who evaluated sam is on the stand
sam anxiously rearranges all the pens on the desk he sits at with rita
projected on a screen is a slide of the drawing lucy made in school
there is an unhealthy reversal of roles here
as you can see from her drawings she has an exaggerated sense of responsibility
lucy feels she has to take care of her father
although at her birthday party her true feelings about her father were revealed
true feelings revealed
the state is paying miss geller for her opinions then every child who rages because they didnt get to stay up for that extra hour of tv objection your honor
sam tugs at ritas sleeve
she ignores it
in fact any child who said they hated their parents because they didnt want to take a bath would be a prime candidate for foster care
i think they want you to stop
thank you sam
we all appreciate your assistance mr
dawson continue with your witness mr
geller i assume in your therapy session mr
dawson extolled his parenting abilities
on the contrary mr
dawson admitted he felt profoundly inadequate that he was terrified hed made and would continue to make and i quote huge mistakes huge mistakes mistakes that are huge
no further questions
rita starts to scribble notes furiously
so does sam
turner smugly sits down
rita confidently strides toward the witness
youre a mother arent you ms
would it be fair to say that as a parent youve felt confused from time to time possibly overwhelmed on occasion even though youre a wonderful mother
gellers thats at question here
but if ms
geller has never had a moment where she felt confused as a mother it would bias her opinion
and it is her expert opinion were all after isnt it mr
ill allow it
thank you your honor
geller i know there have been many moments as a parent where ive felt ive made huge mistakes mistakes that are huge
and ive had to admit them to myself
but most importantly to my therapist
which is the guise mr
dawson thought he was seeing you under isnt that right ms
get to the point ms
the point is youve never had those moments have you ms
moments that every parent ive ever spoken to has moments when youve felt the task is so unbelievably challenging that you feel retarded disabled in some way
moments when you feel everyone has the key but you
but youve never had those moments have you ms
yes or no
let me rephrase the question
when your son oded objection
but if ms
geller didnt feel she had made mistakes mistakes that were huge it might bias her opinion toward mr
i will thank you
geller yes or no when your son oded did you feel you might have made mistakes mistakes that were huge
sam and rita go down the cafeteria line
you made her cry
you got lucky
thats not nice
not very nice
only in there
your secretary too
yellow and green in one bowl
sam stares at a bowl of lima beans and corn you separate the lima beans from the corn please
the cafeteria worker stares at him
sure he will
sam dont be impossible
then to worker can i have the spinach omelet only egg whites no fat no oil no butter and extra mushrooms
sam is anxiously separating his lima beans and corn into separate piles
they arrive at the cashier
rita pulls out her billfold
sam reaches for his wallet
dont be ridiculous
ill get it
i said its my treat
that means ill get it
sam do you really want to get it or are you just trying to trying to what
you know trying to act like a like a what
a real man
i didnt say that
youre my lawyer and you think what they think
i dont have a chance
no chance at all
even with an expert witness
rita looks at him
she chooses her words carefully
a fair trial
answer the question
okay okay okay
what was the question again
do you think what they think
sam cant order food
sam cant pay a check
sam cant take care of lucy
it doesnt matter what i think it matters that we win
youre my lawyer it matters what you think
hey it doesnt matter to them what i think
it matters to me
he reaches for the receipt and faces the cashier defiantly
fourteen thirty three
thats ones quarters and cents less than twenty
he slowly counts his money takes his tray and walks away
rita watches him with a trace of remorse and a hint of admiration
donovan an attractive soft spoken woman is on the stand
rita is working the room
sam having a hard time concentrating is following a crack up the wall and onto the ceiling
donovan the american medical journal named you one of the countrys leading oncologists
isnt that correct
what kept you going the twelve years you were in medical school
and my mothers confidence in me
i wish i had a mother like that
she must have been smart
she had great instincts
do you have any idea what her iq was
in the lower ranges
so your mother this woman with the iq of a nine year old had the wisdom to recognize that you would be a great doctor
i guess her disability didnt seem to hold you back in life
my mothers condition taught me what they cant teach you compassion and patience
traits most doctors have in spades
thank you no further questions
sam runs to hug dr
donovan bumping into rita who sits him down
howd you get through medical school
whered you live
we lived with my mothers parents
oh grandma and grandpa
would it be fair to say your grandparents were of normal intelligence
and didnt these people your grandparents with normal intelligence have the real responsibilities
relishing this objection
i hear mr
turners mother in law lives with him
she must help out
does that mean he doesnt have the real motion to strike that from the record
irrelevant immaterial and immature irrelevant
any parent has a right to a support system
im not talking about the rights of the parent im talking about the rights of a child
the gavel bangs im talking about entrusting an eight year olds welfare in the hands of someone whose records show he was diagnosed with infantile autism mental retardation
motion to strike that from the record
its clear that ones intellectual capacity has no bearing on their ability to love
you honor would you please instruct council to proceed with a modicum of sensitivity
oh im sensitive
im real sensitive when i see people like you the gavel bangs
come here and try to give meaning to your life by screwing up somebody elses
both lawyers approach the bench
both approach and i suppose tearing apart a family is truly noble work mr
i fine you both for contempt
two hundred fifty dollars
whats that to her
she gets that for picking up the phone
oh thats what this is about
ill tell you what this is about
see this is an award for you at some luncheon
but im here everyday
gavel pounds again you win youre out the door
but guess who i see come back
most of the time in less than a year
only now its too late
so youre right
im real sensitive
you cant even touch that area
margaret brown observes sam and lucy
but how did he prove it
columbus had to sail around the world to prove it was round
youre so smart daddy
sam shoots a look at margaret
he hasnt heard anything nice about himself in so long
lucy looks into her fathers eyes
are we winning daddy
sam shoots another look
he doesnt want to lie
lucy catches the look between sam and margaret
excuse me times up
just a little more
i have another client at two thirty
you need to put your shoes on and get ready to go
theres a knot
a really big knot
sam attempts to undo it
lucy and he work very slowly cherishing each moment together
ill help you
she undoes it quickly
hands it back
i need to go to the bathroom
lucys feet dangle from under the stall
margarets sturdy shoes from under another
suddenly lucys head pops out and now she quietly wriggles out from under the stall tip toes across the room and out the door
locking it with a key
lucy runs up to her father
daddy she said we could go to the park
whats going on
what made her change her mind
i started crying in the bathroom
she thought we needed more time
that was so nice of her
sam and lucy hold hands and look out the window
sam sees echo park approaching and gets up
lucy pulls him back to the seat
she looks daddy in the eye and in a furtive whisper lets not get off
lets keep going
that would be wrong
tamaras mommy lost her case and tamara hasnt seen her in six years
shes had five different mommies and one of them hit her
i wont let that happen
thats what her real mommy said
and now they wont even let her talk to her
sam reels with confusion
lucy buries herself in his chest
daddy its the only way to be together
well start a new life get new names
well live in a new apartment
theyll never find us
the bus has stopped
passengers for the park have exited
sam doesnt move
as the busdriver closes the door and heads on he holds lucy protectively to his chest
i love you lucy
i love you
my name isnt lucy anymore its michelle
lucy sleeps cuddled close to sam who is wide awake as he gazes out at the passing highway far from home
we hear the song michelle
sam totally disoriented walks in circles around the plastic tunnels and jungle gym
a flashlight shines in sams face
not yet not yet not yet
you want me to get a black and white down here
he moves toward sam
suddenly the sprinkler system goes on
the cop backs off but sam doesnt move standing in the middle of the park and getting totally wet
not yet not yet not yet
he shines the flashlight in sams face and we see inside the plastic tunnel where lucy sleeps peacefully on a bed of coats holding a discarded stuffed animal
she hasnt been sleeping well
she needs a good nights rest
let her sleep let her sleep
the cop moves toward sam what are you crazy
all the cop sees is a lunatic walking in protective circles in the downpour of the sprinklers with a kid in a plastic tunnel
police doors swing open as rita coat over pjs a sleepy danny by her side storm inside
lucy lies on a bench with her head in sams lap
what were you thinking what were you possibly thinking
danny stay with me he moves away what could you possibly gain by kidnapping your kid in the middle of a custody hearing
she i dont wanna hear it
can you possibly explain this to me
but lucy said whos the parent here
whos the goddamned parent here
stay in the hallway danny turns the corner just as margaret brown rushes in
rita turns to her her expression changes on a dime
miss brown i can imagine what youre thinking
im but i ask you what parent in their right mind seeing their child in pain i have seen their yearning for contact wouldnt take them in an attempt to
where the hell is danny
you he theres oh yes there is
and if i were you id look at my conscience you do have one dont you long and hard before i tried to use this in court
is that a threat
its a plea
givem a break
givem one goddman break
margarets cell phone rings
his temperature couldnt be no not even
okay okay ill come
come on lucy ill take you back
were going home
the fire alarm goes off and goddamn it danny
rita avoids margarets look
margarets cell phone goes off again
she doesnt answer
now rita looks at margaret but this time margaret avoids looking at her
lucy runs to rita and throws her arms around her waist
please dont fire us
it was all my idea
rita is disarmed
shes moved and not used to being moved
the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god
lucys in her best dress being sworn in
one hand in the air
so help me god
and now camera moves around her and we see that shes hiding lucy is on the stand turner is cross examining her
i heard you turned seven this year
thats pretty exciting
everybody gets older
its not that big a deal
whatd you get for your birthday
i havent opened my presents yet
lucy looks to her father and rita
i opened my presents
i got the help album limited edition
what is she doing
oh im sorry
i was confused
i thought you didnt open your birthday presents because you ran away from your own party when your best friend told everyone that you were adopted
i never said that why would i say that
why would your friends say it if you hadnt said it
kids lie all the time
next to her skirt we see her fingers are crossed so hard theyre practically turning purple
may i remind you lucy that youre under oath
and do you know that means if you lie you could be in serious trouble
so now that you and i have agreed to tell the truth where did you sleep last night
rita glares at margaret
thanks a lot
in my bed at the foster home
all right lucy
if youre not going to tell the truth i am
your dad kidnapped you last night and the police found you sleeping in a seedy park a hundred miles from here
youre lying right now because youre afraid
afraid that everyone will see how scared and frustrated you really are
youre afraid of hurting him but now we need to tell the truth
the truth is deep inside you know youre not getting what you need from your father
isnt that right lucy
a long silence
she stares at turner defiantly
all you need is love
we hear that song as sam and rita walk out of the courtroom
rita is breaking pieces off a candy bar she has stuffed in her purse
they see lucy running down the corridor toward sam margaret brown behind her
i did great didnt i
no lucy you lied
dont tell anyone
rita watches sam
moved by his concern as a parent
kerrys here to take you back
i thought youd be proud of me
jo jos mom told him to lie on the stand and say he never saw a needle in the house and he did and now theyre back together
jo jo isnt us
the truth the truth when the judge hears the truth hell know hell know we should be together
bursting nobodys interested in the truth daddy
they lead her down the hallway toward mrs
kerry sams voice gets louder and louder determined to make her hear
the darkness of sams apartment
we see him on his knees
saying his prayers by his bedside
help me god
help me god
help me god
we see annies silhouette from the window of her apartment as it moves across the frame
turner cross examines george the manager of starbucks
sams my most reliable employee
hes never missed a day of work in eight years
always warm always friendly
admirable qualities for a single father
walker in these eight years have mr
dawsons responsibilities which
let me see
would include bussing tables replenishing sweet n lows and sweeping up the place
and isnt that because hes mentally incapable of learning management skills or working the cash register or even making a cup of coffee
leading the witness
you may answer the question
george searches for a way to tell the truth
well as a matter of fact sam and i have been discussing a promotion that i was planning on putting into effect at the end of the week
sam leaps to his feet
thank you george
rita pulls him down
turner seizes the moment
thank you george
now after eight years sam can finally measure out a teaspoon of coffee and cup of water
now he must certainly be able to help lucy with her geometry
objection no further questions
rita prepares ifty
and when i ask another question
i answer in one sentence
short and sweet
short and sweet
my aunt was short and sweet
but her cooking was too spicy she
ritas twitching foot knocks over her purse
out spill several snickers bars with the chocolate picked off them
embarrassed she kneels to pick them up when she and sam see something that stops them both awestruck
in the corner of the corridor huddled on a bench in dark sunglasses sits annie in a professional business suit
sam runs to her
i cant believe it
visibly trembling tell them to take me quickly
give me one minute with the judge
annie wearing her dark glasses is being questioned by rita
besides being lucys godmother arent you also lucys piano teacher
lucys very lucky
didnt you graduate magna cum laud from the julliard school of music
summa cum laud
delighted excuse me
cassell in all the time youve known them have you ever questioned sams ability as a father
look at lucy
shes strong shes able to display true empathy for people all kinds of people
i know you all think shes as bright as she is despite him
but its because of him
turner stands where rita did
can sam add
how about multiplication
so what youre saying is that sam can not even multiply two times two
i dont know about you mr
turner but my fondest memories of my parents have nothing to do with times tables or state capitals
i bet hes knocking on your door all the time with questions
all the time
the last question was whether to use biz or clorox to get the grass stains out of lucys soccer uniform
this is too good to be true
so lets see
he doesnt know math
he cant even wash her clothes
how about puberty
i can only imagine how much insight hell bring to approaching the sensitive issues of a young girls development
turner show me a father any father who knows how to do that and ill give them the parent of the year award
and youve had plenty of opportunity to observe fathers havent you
but the fact that ms
cassell hasnt come out of her room in years might have some effect on her perception
ill allow it
i had twenty eight years in the world to observe all kinds of fathers
what about your father ms
since you appear to be an expert on father daughter relationships
a long pause
sam watches as annie visibly tightens
excuse me ms
cassell i didnt hear your response
what about your father
annie reaches for her water glass
we see her hand shake
it knocks over the glass shattering it on the floor
no further questions
excuse me mr
i said thats enough
i will not allow it
rita doesnt stop him
the judge hesitates incredulous then pounds the gavel as the courtroom erupts
rita sits in her porsche with annie and sam
annie is curled into a tight ball in the passenger seat
sam is tucked into the shelf in the back
his legs kick rita in the face with every gear shift
thank you again annie
you were truly extraordinary
annie doesnt move
okay okay okay okay
well sam has his big day on the stand tomorrow and we need to work a little bit so that hes as effective as you were
on a porsche the uh the door handle is a little hidden by that thingamajig so if youre having a hard time finding it ill just rita reaches across to
open annies door when she screams
annies not quite ready to go outside yet
okay well just take our time
its dark now
annie is still catatonic
ritas on the car phone the kind that voice activates and shes yelling
juanita help danny with his english assignment
ayude danny un story
rising from the dead im ready now
gently good fine sam
sams fallen asleep
rita and sam enter
sam is awestruck at the magnificent home
okay okay okay okay
well work in the library
its down the hall and to the left
they pass another room and see danny zoned out in front of the wide screen tv watching mutant ninja turtles
no answer wheres your father
staring at tv guess
i dont want to guess
where is he
sam watches rita i told you i dont want to guess
well where was he last night
there you guessed it
he said he was working late
thats what he said
well who did he say was taking care of you
but you said you were working late
i am working late
then go work
how was your day
you have to work
how was your her cell phone goes off
rita moves into the hallway to answer her phone
sam moves into the den sits on the couch the sound of rita arguing with her husband drifts into the room
sam looks sideways at danny who remains stonefaced
this is my favorite part
hey dommy this one looks like hes suffering from shell shock
boy i guess we can shell it out
it was a shell of a good hit
rita stands in the doorway watching sam have a longer conversation with her son than shes had in months
danny and sam eat popcorn watching the movie
bellowing turtles in the half shell turtle power
come this is the best part
he heads towards rita
in the half light sam catches a glimpse of rita standing in the pantry unconsciously stuffing marshmallows into her mouth
their eyes lock for a moment
you eat too fast
come watch the movie
its getting late
we have to get to work
handing him a suit this is my husbands
he wont notice
hes got ten more just like it
try it on
sam comes out of the bathroom in the new suit
rita stares at him astonished
he looks incredibly handsome
rita attempting to stifle her reaction turns away from sam
very very good
but your ties crooked
rita stands behind sam with her around him showing him how to do his tie properly
their images are reflected in the mirror
cross over once
loop it around on the inside of your neck
her hand grazes his neck slide the other side through the loop then tighten
rita comes around to the front and straightens and tightens the tie
they are both nervous
the room is charged
okay okay okay okay
our strategy is that were aggressively pursuing a support system
im going to ask you h ow are you prepared to help lucy in school
let me see let me see let me see
i told you you have to stop that
it makes you look stupid
okay okay okay
endless pause you say you will find her a tutor
then i say how will you pay for it
could you slow down
why do you eat so fast
ignoring him weve gone over this a million times
youve found a free tutoring service for her at the ymca
but i didnt
cant you grasp the concept of manipulating the truth
just a little tweak here and there
youre so lucky
you get to play with danny all the time
he doesnt want to play with me
yes he does
he does he does
he thinks you dont want to
oh thats ridiculous of course i want to
exploding i drove around after work yesterday til looking for a goddman razor scooter
in his own world tweak squeak peek peek
rita shifts uneasily embarrassed by her overreaction
okay why did you harass that young boy at your home
you know i didnt harass him rita
you know that you know that
sam im pretending to be mr
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
i didnt harass him mr
turner sam cant keep a straight face you dont look like him
thats a blessing
youre so much prettier
suddenly shy thank you
what makes you think you can take care of a woman i mean a young child when you have a hard time taking care of yourself
rita is relentless
sam is exhausted but determined
but who are you kidding
isnt lucy already smarter than you
in some ways
but in other ways shes not i think
youve got to be firm on this
i think in other ways im smarter than her
smarter than you are mr
in fact in some ways im smarter than you judge mcneilly
bring it down
what parent doesnt want more for their child
to be more than the sum of the parts of the whole of them
yeah yeah yeah but its one thing for a little girl to love her daddy when shes a baby but once she loses respect for you what will you do
fierce i wont let that happen
how can you say that
respect is not just about how smart someone is
smart is not just about how smart someone is
but what about lucy
arent you being selfish
doesnt she deserve a better life
dont you think shes just pretending shes happy to not hurt your feelings
sam jumps up from the table trembling with anger
lucy is happy
we have fun
we go to dennys we go to video night
i know how to love her
i know im not going to able to go to law school and learn how to be a mean person but i know how to love
i know how to be her father mr
by this time he is face to face with rita breathing hard overcome with emotion
rita is unexpectedly near tears
suddenly before she knows it she is holding sam
the room charged
she speaks tenderly moved by this awkward boy man
i know you do sam
i know you do
sam rushes into the coffee shop in his new suit
you look great sam
what time do you have to be in court
half day half day
i take the stand at two
george leads him behind the counter
the staff beams
euphorically sam approaches the huge espresso machines
okay we need two grande cappucinos non fat
sprinkles or cinnamon
sam is doing great
hes humming as he prepares a triple latte with the precision of a swiss watchmaker
the place is packed including a group of japanese tourists
sam zips around trying to juggle between the blender the espresso machine steamed milk icemaker all the while glancing up at the clock
sam hands three cups to customers the foam overflowing coffee spilling out
a customer takes a sip and spits it out
what is this
i ordered an americano not a latte
americano americano not a latte
working as fast as he can but still not fast enough sam unconsciously drinks the latte
hyped on coffee sam is zooming around and hes a mess
shirt hangs out coffee stains on it his hair wild
frazzled he forgets to put the lid on the blender and turns it on
a mint mocha frappuccino splatters him in the face
at that moment george comes out of his office
im going to be late
im going to be late
ill call a taxi
no no i cant wait
i cant wait
ive got to go right now
sam heads out the coffee drink still dripping from his face
walking a hundred miles an hour sam barrels down the street out of his mind
cars are jammed up
he walks over them a man possessed
everyone is in their places waiting
your honor if the defendant doesnt have enough interest in his daughter to even show up your honor im sure hell be here any moment
this is an extremely important day to mr
at that moment sam bursts through the doors
suit stained hair sticky with frappuccino
ritas jaw drops
your honor may i have a moment with my client
make it brief ms
rita heads towards sam
up close he looks even worse
what the hell happened
sniffing the air what is that smell
sam determined heads for the stand
rita grabs sams shoulders and tries to focus him
looks deep into his eyes
sam look at me
look at me
he does i will guide you like last night
sam hugs her not that part of last night the other part
now you can do it
i know you can
lucy needs you
a mile a minute lucy needs me
yes slow down because lucy needs you
lucy needs you
we need you
sam on the stand talks a mile a minute from the coffee
how will you be able to pay for private tutoring
theres a free program at the ymca
lucy can go there
but dont you ever think it would be better for lucy if she lived with a permanent foster family and you could visit whenever you wanted
the fosters dont know her
why cant she live with me and they can come visit if they want to
im firm on this
and im getting firmer
lucy belongs with me
sam puts his finger to his chin and starts his let me see
rita gives him a look he lowers his finger and starts talking very fast from the coffee
the stenographer desperately tries to keep pace
paul wrote the first part of the song michelle
he said to john where do i go from here
john had been listening to nina simone
there was a line in it that went something like i love you i love you i love you
they put that into the song
it wouldnt be the same song without that
it made the song complete
thats why the whole world cried when they broke up on april
well he has some kind of point
mary the stenographer is still typing
did you get that mary
turner fires questions at sam a mile a minute
when you were lucys age were you living at home
were you living with your mother and father
well then where were you living
very quietly in an institution
so your parents put you in an institution
only after my mom got sick
what about your father
where was he
gone with the wind when sam was born
so you werent raised by your mother
i saw her i saw her
christmas easter and my birthday
oh once a year on your birthday
so in a way the people at the institution were your parents
were they nice to you
did they hit you
sometimes they did sometimes
like when you hit lucys friend at her birthday party
nobody hit anybody
let me rephrase that strong armed
so what role model do you call upon as a father when youre parenting lucy
the head of the institution
the principal the warden
you have the mental capacity of a seven year old
so you ask yourself a seven year old i am not a seven year old
how to parent a fellow seven year old
what was the question
the question is what makes you think you can be a parent
your friends who cant even testify for you
objection my friends objection my friends love lucy even if rita thought they werent smart enough to testify
even if she said youd wipe the floor with them
trying to telepathically reach sam
excuse me mr
dawson your lawyer just objected that means you didnt have to answer the question
you cant even follow the simple rules youve watched here day after day
you really think you can raise a seven year old
a ten year old
a thirteen year old
in his face that means shell be six years more advanced than you
sweat pours down sams coffee stained collar
he searches for words
then from the clearest place inside himself ive had a lot of time to think about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent
it has to do with constancy
it has to do with patience
it has to do with listening
to pretending to listen when you cant even listen anymore
the court is riveted by sams eloquence
it has to do with love like she says
ritas antenna goes up whos she
and i dont know where its written that a woman has a corner on that market that a man has any less of those emotions than a woman
billy has a home with me
its not perfect
im not a perfect parent
sometimes i forget hes just a little kid
whispers from the courtroom we built a life together and we love each other and if you destroy that it may be irrep irrep irrep
all eyes turn to the back of the room
ifty is there trying with all his might to help his friend
joanne dont do that please
dont do it twice not to him
then meryl streep cant even look at dustin hoffman after that
right kramer vs
thank you for the commentary mr
its hard to find words isnt it mr
its confusing to know what to say to lucy half the time isnt it
mortified so uncomfortable in this strange world so at a loss how to swim through it beginning to believe everything turners saying sam looks out at the faces in the
rita stunned and incredulous turner and his associate smirking at him ifty shaking his head robert his face in his hands miss wright margaret brown the states expert almost willing
him to fail
are they right
no yes no
let me see let me see let me see
you dont know what
youre right you dont know
you dont know enough to really raise your daughter
these arent questions these are attacks
frantic i am lucys father
are you really
im not talking about the fact that you got some homeless woman pregnant
objection your honor
i motion a recess
get to the question mr
the question is if you love your daughter as much as they say you do dont you think she deserves more
in your heart of hearts secretly question yourself every day
was that a yes
she deserves everything
in my heart of hearts
yes she does
and you agree with everyone you cant give her that
in unbearable pain maybe
maybe everybodys right
he got it
watching sam unravel as he stands up and starts walking around in a circle in the witness box
no more no more
let it stop
the judge watches sam sad and stunned
the verdict is obvious
sam has passed judgement on himself
sam broken walks down the long hallway with rita toward margaret browns office
suddenly rita stops as she and sam both see sitting hopeful on the bench
she searches sams face for the verdict
the minute she sees sorrow in his eyes she knows
she runs to him gluing herself to his chest
in a series of wordless dissolves they hold each other in the hallway through the entire forty five minute visit
the only thing moving is the hands of a large wall clock in the background
pained margaret reaches for lucy
its time to say goodbye
dont let go dont let go dont let go sams tears mix with lucys as they sob clinging to each other
with such fierce love a parent and a child
dont let them daddy dont let them
dont ever let me go
he cant let her go
that he cant do
margaret steel herself turns to rita no matter how many times shes done this
please help me
rita aching from a place she thought she buried long ago shakes her head no
now margaret literally has to wrench lucy away from her fathers arms
lucy bellowing as she pulls her down the hallway
sam is frozen in incalculable pain
we hear fool on the hill
we follow a trail of pink liquid melting down the hall and come to annies door where a pile of grocery bags and newspapers sit in a puddle of strawberry
suddenly the needle scrapes loudly across the record followed by a mysterious pounding against the wall
the camera moves to the window
inside the lights are dim
lucys hammock swings empty ghostlike
sam curled into a ball in lucys bare corner bangs his head over and over again against the wall overcome with grief
the pounding continues as we see rita standing in the doorway watching her sleeping child
this stranger that shes raised
she moves to cover him this tough little boy when she sees pooh bear tucked under his arm
she tucks them both in tenderly
saturday in idyllic suburbia
sam directions and a map in his hands tentatively rounds the corner
a small bouquet of flowers in his hands when he stops staring ahead at lucy looking absolutely radiant in a new spring dress
she stands on the front porch with randy who wears a red smock and is setting up two easels and paints
theres a tiny chair for lucy and a tiny chair for her
the tension in lucys face randy straining to connect with her
your teacher told me you were an artist
you wear too much perfume
youre trying too hard
i am arent i
maybe you could teach me how to paint
my daddys coming today
were going to open my birthday presents
why dont you just go do something
from where he stands all he sees is lucy getting everything she deserves
he looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand feeling profoundly inadequate he reaches for some flowers from a garden hes passing
puts them in his bouquet
tries to put the flowers back
he stares up at lucy on the porch a few houses away
lucy sits on the steps
randy sits right next to her
where he was standing but is now gone
the flowers lay in the dirt
from the porch lucy looks out and waits
the place is buzzing
sam listlessly cleans the tables without the usual energy and verve
a toddler marches around a table playing under the adoring gaze of his parents
excuse me my kid knocked over a coffee could you clean this up
sam sees a family at a table covered with spilled coffee
i said i need a refill and a towel over here
snapping you need a towel
a glass of water
you need more than you already have
you have everything all his fury and frustration everything
but its not enough
take my daughter too
sams out of control the whole shop stares at him as he backs into a shelf of mugs he so carefully arranged
they crash onto the floor
paints and brushes go flying across the porch as lucy knocks them over
totally out of control
you gave him the wrong address
youre hiding me from him
as randy reaches for her lucy pours black paint on her
lucy sits in a ball on the corner of the porch
her eyes swollen from crying
finally she gets up and moves to the tiny chair that randy put out for her
straightens the easel and begins to paint
the front door opens and randy comes out having washed her face and hair
without speaking randy straightens her easel and sits down next to lucy and begins to paint
randy and lucy paint in silence for a long time
then youre going to send me away now arent you
we hear what sounds like a childs hand playing the song here there and everywhere
we see sam sitting at lucys miniature toy piano as he plays with one finger
in a series of dissolves as days and weeks pass we see sams hands at the piano with lucy and randys hands as they paint side by side to sams
lucys pictures start angry angular with blacks and blues then gradually soften and the dark figures recede
by the end there is a brushstroke of the red of randys smock peeking into the corner of lucys picture
we come back to sam having withdrawn completely into himself serenading no one
we see lucy and randy sitting on her bed unwrapping the birthday presents
time has passed
they look close almost like a mother and daughter
lucy finishes unwrapping sams present and we see a stack of one hundred dennys napkins
oh he mustve forgotten to put the gift in
randy picks up one of lucys pictures and moves to the wall
you know this wall really needs something special on it
lucy half smiles and unconsciously begins to fold one of the dennys napkins into an origami bird
then crushes it
then cautiously whats the longest any one of those kids stayed with you
megan stayed a little over a year
averting her eyes did you ever want any of them to stay longer
understanding how huge a question this is coming from this bruised little heart
sam sits in a dark corner maniacally folding newspaper into an odd origami pattern
theres a knock at the door sam doesnt move he just continues folding his paper
sam its me
he doesnt answer it just methodically folds
rita stands there impatiently
i dont have time for this
you were supposed to show up for your first evaluation
and i leave work early to get there and where the hell are you
open the door
open the goddamn door
if you dont care enough to open the goddamn door im outta here
ive ruined my practice ive alienated my colleagues i sent my kid off on a fishing trip with his father so i could work with you and you wont open
your goddman door for me
ive had enough
she starts down the hall when suddenly she turns and with the mastery of a karate black belt runs and kicks the door down
rita bursts through the door and then stops
sam has created an origami wall of newspapers intricately woven together
a fortress against the world
he keeps folding doesnt even look at rita
hes more far gone than she could imagine she walks gingerly to the wall and knocks gently on it
sam its rita
can i come in
i lived in the east village
i dont need a lot of room
sam makes life too hard
sam makes life too hard on everyone
sam i can go at least nine more rounds
but you gotta let me in
he pulls out one small brick of origami opening a window
now i can see your kind eyes
george told me you needed a break from work
i dont want to work there anymore
too many people
maybe we could find you a quieter job
because remember one of the judges conditions is you have to earn more money youve got to keep earning more money for when we get you lucy back
lucy doesnt need me anymore
she has a new family
she doesnt need me anymore
is that what she said
she didnt have to say it
i may be stupid but i know
well thats the first stupid thing ive ever heard you say
sam looks at her through the window
a chink in the wall
sam sam you can get her back
the court favors reunification
the only thing that can block you is if the foster family petitions to adopt
and from what ive heard lucys making their life miserable thats our girl
sam fight for her
you dont know
you dont know
i dont know
you dont know what it is to try and try and never get there
you were born perfect perfect
is that right
everyone else is perfect but only sam feels loss and pain
people like you dont know
people like me
people like you dont know dont know what hurt feels like people like you dont feel dont feel anything
she slaps him
stunned he slaps her back
stunned she slaps him again
he slaps her
she rips the newspaper wall down
you think you got the market cornered on human suffering
well let me tell you something about people like me
people like me feel little and lost and ugly and dispensable
people like me have perfect husbands screwing someone far more perfect than me and my son my son hates me i try too hard and i push and he knows
it and i talk in that voice that voice i promised id never use and ive screamed ive screamed horrible things to him a five year old because he doesnt want to get in the car at the end of a day and he stares at me with such anger and i hate him then
i know im failing you i know im disappointing you i know you deserve better but get in the fucking car
its like every morning i wake up and fail and i look around and anybody anybody can pull it off but somehow i cant
and i know i know i have everything and im still miserable and its pathetic
i know its pathetic
no matter how hard i try something about me will never be enough
shes crying too hard to continue
he pulls her to him
before she realizes whats happening shes holding him tightly
he whispers in her ear
youre so much more than enough
he looks her straight in the eye shes undone by the intimacy of the moment by the strength of his purity
and staring into his eyes she begins to sob walls crumbling
he kisses her elbow her shoulder her forehead her eyes her tears
and something ignites between them something confused and scary and deep and filled with a passionate ache
on a bed of newspaper that was once a wall they come together whole again
sam rounds the corner walking or rather being walked by six dogs all shapes all sizes
he heads up the walkway to randys house
she comes out of the house and shuts the door behind her stopping him
all the lights were green
theres a reason for the court schedule
you stopped showing up
lucy has had to rebuild her life
i want her back
i can do it
i know i can
thats not up to me but im telling you i will do everything in my power to prevent lucy from getting hurt again
sam hangs his head
a dog barks at randy
whose dogs are these
supplemental income supplemental income bathe walk and feed
sam dawson meets your canine needs
to dogs sit
all the dogs sit but a big black lab
randy heads into the house
the front door opens and lucy comes out
she runs down the stares to sam
thrilled sam opens his arms to her
she leaps into them and begins slugging his chest with pent up fury
you never came
you never even called
you forgot about me
how could you forget me
i never forgot you
i forgot me
i hate you i hate you i hate you
lucy pulls away
a long charged silence
lucy refusing to even look at her father
lucy i tried to write you a letter last night
buster has a cold
but the letter had too many big words
the black lab has begun eating randys flowers
lucy stares forward
sam speaks tentatively carefully dear lucy
dear lucy im sorry that i hurt you
every moment of the day i thought about you
lucy in the hammock lucy at school
lucy in the sky
i love you recorded september th the day you took your first step
lucy raises her head and looks at sam for the first time
rows of carrots tomatoes cucumbers and uh oh a tomatos in the peas
a hand comes into frame and carefully places the tomato just so in the tomato bin
now it moves to the olives
shouldnt all the pimentos be facing up
to reveal sam in white apron and hat deftly filling the containers of the elaborate salad bar as people fill their plates
napa cabbage excellent choice
purple and green purple and green
very rich in vitamin c
very good choice
sam walks toward the courtroom when we see rita approaching from the other end of the hall
they both slow down when they see each other
rita unconsciously fixes her hair
sam adjusts his tie
they almost shake hands realize that means touching each other and dont
rita motions toward the door
we already did
dont tell anybody
they nervously walk through the door bumping into each other
shes very aware of sam
he looks away over compensating obviously
throughout the scene ritas hair falls in her eyes
she attempts to put it in place
furthermore my client has found a new job and is making every effort to find a bigger apartment so that ritas hair falls in her eyes again
sam stands up pulls her barrette from his pocket the one she left at his house
rita stares at the barrette as if it were the murder weapon
oh thank you
a lovely barrette mr
it will look great on lucy
who im sure you bought it for
furthermore so that
there will be more room for lucy as she grows up
all of that is well and good but the fact that mr
dawson quite his job missed his hearing and did not even show up for his visits with his daughter
the fact that my client went through profound depression is the most natural reaction any parent could have
but once again he had no idea how his behavior during that depression impacted on his daughter
in these next months mr
dawson will be expanding his support system to include social service programs tutors its too late
the foster family is petitioning the court for sole custody of lucy and i fully support their request
sam turns to rita
this cant be happening
sam rita ifty robert and brad sit in a booth
with one extra person its a little tight
rita picks at her salisbury steak special trying to deal with the business at hand
isnt it illegal
its illegal to go through stop signs
its illegal to cross on the red
its not illegal
its very complicated
when a strong foster parent lobbies for a child it changes the equation
theyre reaching right through sam as if he doesnt exist
as if hes a ghost
theres one option weve never talked about sam
very carefully i know what you went through the last time you took the stand
we could settle out of court ask for the most incredible visitation rights it would almost seem like joint custody
youre saying i dont have a chance
thats what youre saying
im not saying you dont have a chance
thats what you said last time and look where he is now
ritas not saying i dont have a chance
tell me i have a chance
too long a pause
ifty looks at the clock
oh my god
is video night at my house and im not even there
if we get there before you do well wait for you check
sam get your dessert to go
this is very hard to say
im having my dessert here
im not coming to video night
devastated ifty robert and brad solemnly gather their things
sam if you want to go
i said no rita
i know but if you what
do you want me to go
i didnt say that
but do you want to go
they leave in a huff
the waitress delivers the check with dessert and coffee
ive got it
ive got it
rita slowly eats her pie
its good to chew
youre eating more slowly
rita laughs and nods
sidebar we need to talk
carefully yes we do
i need to get lucy back
we need we need to be professional
do you know what that means
when dealing with starbucks customers be friendly but not familiar
i can be your friend
oddly touched thank you sam
you need to leave your husband
her armor up again oh my marriage isnt so bad
life is very short and theres no time for fussing and fighting my friend
undone its just
its just that
ive never lost anything
randy kisses lucy goodbye as she heads toward school
we follow lucy suddenly a bird sails through the sky and lands in front of lucy
its an origami bird
she looks around but doesnt see sam anywhere
but she feels him
she walks toward school clutching the bird past a tree and we move up that tree and see sam nestled in the branches
they made contact
its later that week
lucy walks proudly down the street in a girl scout uniform selling cookies
randy is by her side beaming
thats seven dollars cents less than thirty
well thats one way of looking at it
dissolve as they move through the neighborhood
finally we see her bound up the steps to an apartment building
she knocks on the door
it opens and lucy and randys jaw sam stands there
holding three kittens
we see various dogs in arm chairs the couch
what are you doing here
i live here
this is where i live
this is where you live
so close to me
i wanted to be close to you
i wanted to be closer
look at my apartment number
its number john was born on october th
his son was born on october th
john met yoko on november th
his mother lived at newcastle liverpool
lucy give me one minute with your father
sam i consider myself an understanding person but i dont understand this
you cant close the distance between you and lucy with a new address
we go to court in a week i dont want to spend half my visit with lucy on the bus getting to lucy
i dont want to waste one more minute
from the doorway does buster still have his cold
hes better much better
now ill have one box of mint chocolate cookies
thatll be three eighty six
in unison let me see let me see let me see
thats one dollar and cents less than five
randy watches with a mixture of jealousy and fear as lucy effortlessly enters her and sams universe
from the window randy watches as sam hands lucy four leashes and the two of them get pulled down the street by the dogs
lucy lies in her hammock unable to sleep
staring at the little origami bird on her window sill
she moves it opens the window wide quickly takes mr
jeeters and within a moment shes out the window and onto the limb of the tree
the night grows teeth
stray dogs fight over garbage a wino talks to himself and in the midst of it all walks lucy in her pjs
jeeters tucked under her arm
lucy crosses the street
the screeching of tires
were looking at an old fashioned fire escape when suddenly we make out a figure climbing higher and higher
we catch glimpses of her and then lose her as the neon sign across the street blinks on and off
suddenly his eyes open wide
and like an animal sensing danger he gets up
we hear the sound of something thumping against rung after rung of the fire escape
he rushes to his window and looks to see lucy climbing the fire escape
sam opens the window and reaches for her
what are you doing
you could have really hurt yourself
what are you doing
i couldnt sleep
daddy did you know that warren g
harding was the twenty ninth president of the united states
remember the twenty ninth president
in case the judge asks
sam in his pajamas holds a sleeping lucy in his arms
he turns a corner and heads up the walkway to randys house
he knocks on the door
finally the door opens and we see randy and bill in their pajamas shocked at seeing sam and lucy
she couldnt sleep
give me my daugh she stops herself give me ill take lucy
maybe if you rub her tummy twenty three times tell her two stories and give her half a dennys blueberry muffin and a third of a glass of milk shell
randy and bill her husband watch as sam turns and walks purposely down the walkway his houseslippers scuffling on the quiet street
lucy in her pjs walks down the middle of the street
lucy knocks on sams window
lucy and sam walk back down the street to randys house
lucy lugs encyclopedias to sams windowsill
lucy in a blanket being carried by sam toward randys house
until finally we see lucy in her hammock at randys house looking out the windows which have now been completely covered with bars
her room is filled with origami birds from the dennys napkins her birthday gift
lucy gets out of her hammock and tiptoes across her room quietly opening the door
we follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the stairs
she gets to the front door
its been dead bolted where she cannot reach it
from the darkness we hear tenderly lucy
randy sits in the darkness next to a third of a glass of milk and a half a dennys blueberry muffin
i made us a midnight snack
lucy stares at the muffin and milk
i understand that you want to see your daddy
and i dont want to keep you from him
i honestly dont
so you tell me when you want to see him
you can see him anytime you want
but we have to arrange it first
do you understand
lucy nods now would you like a snack
elated randy makes room for her on the couch
but lucy just reaches for the milk and muffin and heads up the stairs then turns back and speaks gently to randy
words caught in her throat goodnight lucy
we pan across the room and see sams shoes his tie and a at the door sam opens it to see rita standing there looking intensely vulnerable holding her husbands
my husband left this when he moved out
oh lovely rita meter maid
entering nice place
i worry sometimes
you worry you did the wrong thing
i worry that ive gotten more out of this relationship than you
no no no
im the lucky one
i have the lawyer that never loses
covering thats me
okay let me see let me see let me see
pulls out notes theyre going to put bill and randy on the stand first and then you
them first then me
theyre a nice couple
they have a nice house
shes smart too
i can tell
the manager of the salad bar is gonna testify isnt he
that will help us
for a moment ritas mask drops and her fear for sam overwhelms her
nobody believed that george harrison could really be a song writer
but he wrote here comes the sun
john and paul said it was one of the best songs on abbey road
tenderly george was always my favorite beatle
lucys was paul
randy and bill are asleep when randy senses something
she opens her eyes and sees lucy staring at her
i want to see him now
we see sam sleeping in bed
theres a knock at the door
sam wakes with a start throws down the covers
we see that hes wearing the armani suit
sam opens the door to see randy standing there holding a sleeping lucy in her arms
she fell asleep on the car ride over
i was gonna turn back and tuck her in to her bed
with the pink canopy
and the quilt i made
but i was afraid shed wake up at our house
fighting the ache in her soul and want to come home
sam looks at randy with profound compassion
i was gonna tell the judge that i could give lucy the kind of love she never had
but i would be lying
i hope i hope i hope that youre saying what i think youre saying even though youre not saying it
randy nods and hands the sleeping lucy into sams strong arms
for a moment they both hold lucy between them in the most unique embrace
randy finally lets go and struggles to say goodbye
ill see you in court
save me a seat
on your side
randy walks away
stunned sam watches her holding lucy in his arms
then from a very brave place randy
if i tell you i cant do it alone will you tell the judge
turns gently no
ive looked and looked for a mother for lucy
help i need someone help not just anyone
youre the red in lucys painting
so unexpectedly bonded to them both
a glorious sunny day
lucy and her team are in the middle of a fierce game
a foul is called when we hear penalty
sam wearing a uniform and whistle around his neck walking his inimitable walk races up the field coaching the team
ifty robert and brad sit in the bleachers
robert in sunglasses paranoid looking behind him
brad follows around an attractive young woman as close as he can get to her
sam runs by the water stand manned by randy and bill
they share a look a moment of intense parental pride
lucy and a kid named phillip go after the ball
phillip you get her
i saw that
you gave him a secret signal
keep both eyes on the ball lucy balls are round on sale at kmart
the earth is a ball too
phillip steps in front of lucy and shoves her as hard as he can
sam blows his whistle repeatedly and races over
kick his ass outta the game
with danny hollering from the stands
looks over at her father
sam does every coaching gesture and referee hand signal from every sport known to man
it looks like a bizarre twyla tharp dance
she does it right back at him
their secret code
the code that will bind them for the rest of their lives
what the hell was that
sam blows his whistle
the game heats up
lucys team gets the ball and is headed toward the goal
sam is running right alongside them so excited until he cant hold himself back anymore and intercepts the ball
sam runs valiantly down the field with it
we hear here comes the sun
little darlin its been a long cold lonely winter
little darlin it feels like years since youve been here
here comes the sun
here comes the sun
and i say its alright
and the credits roll
