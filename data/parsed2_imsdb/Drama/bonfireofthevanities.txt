moving in fast motion a kaleidoscopic jewel box glittering shining and speeding past our eyes
moving south to north from the battery and the world trade center streets and buildings flipping past like black diamonds spilling into our peripheral vision and disappearing as we speed
cars and people caught in the same frantic ballet of shining lights as we race up the avenue and the voice of peter fallow speaks to us
were getting closer
can you feel it
can you see it
moving fast into the heart of it
can you feel the buzz
the city is pulling you in
the city of light
the city of diabolical promise
the city of answered prayers
thru thru pulls up to the world financial center and drives into the lower garage
a male and female aide both carrying walkie talkies rush to open the door
they pry peter fallow from the back seat
he is wearing a tuxedo and dark glasses
he is very drunk disheveled and cheerful beyond his means
continue in one shot as
try to lead fallow into the building
fallow is clutch ing a whiskey decanter and a seltzer bottle
he leans heavily on the aides stumbles and can barely stay on his feet
t bonfire of the vanities rev
the aides flag it down and throw fallow onto the cart
the cart carries him past the garbage con tainer into a long tunnel like corridor
sways on the cart trying to mix a drink for himself he pulls a glass out of one pocket and some ice cubes out of another pocket
but he is physically incompetent
jumps onto the cart and tries to hold him up
the male aide runs alongside the cart
in black tie carry covered silver trays as they trot through the tunnel
come running in the other way pushing carts filled with dirty dishes and glasses
comes to the end of the tunnel and jerks to a halt
fallow loses his balance and sprays the female aide with soda water
pulls fallow off the cart and continues to lead him through a dark red lit area
several security guards run to meet them
the guards and the aide now escort fallow through the area
pop out of nowhere trying to get a picture
the guards push them away and lead fallow into a lighted corridor
and his wife and daughter join the entourage as they head for an elevator
the diplomat offers fallow a pen and a book to autograph
fallow misses the pen and falls face down into the breasts of the diplomats daughter
the guards pull him into the elevator
t bonfire of the vanities rev
is in the elevator a tray of salmon mousse in the shape of a three foot salmon
the elevator starts to move
fallow falls into the mousse
the aide pulls him up and tries to clean him off
fallow is led out of the elevator
several other aides approach him and pull off his soiled jacket and shirt and change them for fresh ones as they move
rush fallow snapping pictures with little instamatics and trying to get an autograph
is led through the corridor and into
a ten story glass atrium
a black tie party
a sixty foot banner with fallows name on it
but before fallow can get his bearings
obliterate the view
fallow staggers clutching his head and we
through the skylight we can see sherman mccoy on his hands and knees on the green marble foyer of this lavish apartment chasing the family dachshund trying to attach a
and it begins on a rainy night only a few months ago
come on marshall
mccoy apartment sherman evening the dog escapes
sherman smacks his perfect wasp knee on the perfect marble floor
t bonfire of the vanities rev
our hero sherman mccoy was about to make a simple phone call
and despite the existence of eleven telephones and seven different lines in the fourteen rooms of his six million dollar plus apartment this was a phone call he could not
make at home
what on earth are you doing
angle judy mccoy standing over sherman who continues to struggle with the dog
bonfire of the vanities rev
i am taking the dog for a walk
you are not taking the dog for a walk
you are taking marshall for a walk
marshall has a name
he is one of our family
and anyway its raining
i know that
the dog growls and snaps at sherman
so does marshall
i dont think he wants to go
do you marshall
sherman gets the leash fastened
he stands up pulls on a rubberized british riding mac
judy flicks a tiny plastic bag out of a cleverly concealed container and hands it to sherman
have a nice time
mccoy apartment building lobby sherman night a pulls marshall out of the elevator
marshall squeals and drags his nails across the lobby trying desperately to avoid this walk
he dont look too happy about it mr
neither am i bill
my name is tony
yes of course
come on marshall
is dragging marshall out of the building as a limo pulls up and the immaculately dressed pollard browning gets out
he looks at sherman shermans clothes and shermans dog
he doesnt approve
as they pass each other under the awning
good evening pollard
you know its raining dont you
as a matter of fact i did notice
a true friend to mans best friend
pollard you old phrase maker
i beg your pardon
i mean is that the best you can do
is that as witty as we get
as pollard enters the building and sherman drags marshall away
i dont know what youre talking about
and furthermore if you plan on being wet when you return i suggest you take the service elevator
sherman drags marshall to the phone
they are both already soaking wet
sherman dials a number
a woman answers
on phone hello
may i speak to maria
who is this
brief pause then
sherman is about to say yes when he catches himself
mccoy apartment judy night is on the phone
sherman is that you
realizes what hes done
then he hangs up
mccoy apartment judy night looks at the phone then puts it down
is dragging marshal back into the building
mccoy bedroom judy night is on her exercise bike pedaling furiously
she can hear sherman coming into the apartment
well were back
comes scampering into the bedroom followed by sherman
well you were right
i got soaking wet and marshall didnt do anything
he heads for the bathroom grabs a towel
sherman if you want to talk to somebody named maria why do you call me instead
sherman pokes his head into the room
if i what
whatever do you mean
please dont lie
it makes your forehead crinkle
wait a minute
what are we talking about
you should see your face
its a veritable roadmap of tension and deceit
im sorry but i dont get it
have i missed something
darling the only thing youre missing is common sense
youre going to stand there and tell me you didnt call here and ask to speak to some maria
you think i dont know your voice
judy i was out walking the dog
i was not on the telephone
crinkle crinkle crinkle
im not lying
i took marshal for a walk and i come back in here and wham i mean i hardly know what to say
youre asking me to prove a negative proposition
oh god sherman
listen to the way i sound
listen to the stress
can you hear it
i dont want to be this person
i am thin
i am beautiful
i dont deserve this
she gets off the bike grabs a robe and heads for the door
theres the phone
why dont you just call her from here
i dont care
i really dont care
you are cheap and rotten and a liar and you are dripping on the aubusson carpet
sherman collapses in a chair
he looks at the phone
she was right of course
and sherman knew it
how could he have been so stupid
a simple phone call
mccoy apartment campbell mccoy day is running through the apartment toward the front door
she is seven years old
descending the five foot wide walnut staircase that leads from the second floor to the marble foyer
in this view we can see that sherman mccoy like his surroundings is impeccably designed and dressed
the next morning judys words were still ringing in his ears
and a liar
but was it really his fault
in a way she had brought it on herself hadnt she
he intercepts campbell at the foot of the stairs
are we ready
im out of here
wheres your mother
shes crying on the lifecycle
on the lifecycle again
like all those other women she spends so much time with
so drawn so pale
you could see lamplight through their bones
as sherman picks up his briefcase and a copy of the newspaper campbell opens the door and rings for the elevator
approaches them looking pale and thin and drawn dressed in exercise clothes sweating and still crying
she looks like shes spent a sleepless night
she wont kiss me because im all wet
campbell kiss your mother
campbell kisses judy
but judy walks away without speaking to him
sherman watches her
looking pretty unappetizing in her soggy sweatpants
he was still a young man in the season of the rising sap
he deserved more than these
these social x rays
and she was turning into one of them
come out of the building
dragging themselves to their sports training classes they keep themselves so thin they look like x ray pictures
sports trained to death
my name is bill
yes of course
campbell say hello to tony
sherman is distracted by
fuller firmer and excruciatingly wrapped in a pair of yellow shorts that are screaming for attention
puts campbell on a school bus
the bus pulls away
sherman was a master of the universe
he deserved better
thru thru walks into the chaos and moves through the din a smile of pleasure and anticipation on his lips
we catch bits of conversation
i said pick up the fucking phone please

a frantic salesman is a dead one

sherman and several men are seated at attention facing an adam bowfront cabinet
the cabinet is richly painted with scenes of bucolic splendor and ornate borders
on top of this museum piece a black plastic speaker over which the voice of gene lopwitz is addressing his inferiors

sherman flips off the speaker
at ease gentlemen
the meeting breaks up
moving through the bond trading room to his desk
the roar enveloped him
music to his ears
the sound of educated young white men baying for money on the bond market
six hundred million in his hands
six million off the top for pierce pierce
one point seven million for sherman
all in a days work
he was there
at the top impervious untouchable insulated by wealth and power
a great height from which to view the rest of the poor world
a great height from which to fall
spitting out the message sherman arriving new york on the concorde tonight
the sky is a labyrinth of planes taking off and landing
comes out of the customs area into the lobby
she is a vision young beautiful ultra chic in her big shouldered electric blue norma kamali type jacket her miniskirt her lizard shoes
the sweaty hordes of panting tourists all seem to part like the red sea as maria passes through them followed by a porter and a trolley full of luggage
moving toward maria
they embrace clumsily
w bonfire of the vanities rev
sherman you are an absolute angel coming all the way out here
i had to talk to you
i did the most stupid thing last night

we have to
dont you want a little poon tang first

tell mama all about it
moving off the van wyck and onto the grand central parkway
maria is laughing
she is fiddling with the back of shermans neck and chewing on his ear while her other hand is in his crotch
maria is laughing
i know it has its funny side but it isnt funny
well its your own fault for getting caught like a red herring
you mean red handed
thats what i said
couldnt we just forget about your wife and go on over to our little hideaway on th street and hide away a little
w bonfire of the vanities rev
i think she knows

w bonfire of the vanities rev
sherman where are we

what does that mean
it means were going north
all i need to do is make a left and go west and find a street back to manhattan
makes a right out of the traffic and suddenly
surrounds the car people music cars colors
a boulevard of dizzy sounds and sights
as it stops for a red light
where are all the white people
is being pursued by a prostitute
she is stoned moving in slow motion screaming
she grabs him from behind he elbows her in the stomach
she falls to her knees right in front of the mercedes
shes not touching the car is she
sherman im from the south and im beginning not to like this very much
leans on the hood of the car stands up and continues her pursuit of the pimp
leans out the window
excuse me please dont touch the car
sherman get us out of here
i have a red light
a face appears at the window next to maria
a young latin man
we having a party
maria leans toward sherman and presses her foot down on the accelerator
the car jerks into motion
leaps across the intersection and continues down the boulevard
look theres no need to panic
thats what you think
i have all my luggage with me
i just dont want to do anything stupid
if we keep our heads well be perfectly fine
were in the middle of a goddamn war zone and youre worried about doing the right thing
reads east geo
and just beyond the sign a ramp leading up to the expressway
george washington bridge you see it
as sherman pulls toward the ramp
another pothole jolts the car
marias luggage flies forward hitting sherman in the back of his neck
at the same time maria sees something in the road ahead of them
sherman hits the brake
the car stalls and comes to a screeching halt
its a body
it looks like
its an animal
i think its a
is it dead
its a wheel thats all
its a tire
its a dead tire
calm down maria
its a tire and some ash cans or something
sherman starts to get out of the car
what are you doing
well i cant drive around it can i
youre going to move it
thats exactly what im going to do
for gods sake be careful of your shoes
gets out of the car
he leaves the door open
above him the tremendous clanging noise of cars pounding along the expressway
but he cant see them
he can only hear them and feel their vibration
he stands there a moment taking in the strangeness of the place and of his own situation the tire maria his wife his life
a little chill of lone liness hits him
he shakes it off and walks to the tire a simple inevitable move toward a destiny he could never have imagined
as sherman approaches
he tries to pick it up without getting his suit messed up
he turns tire in his hands and sees
walking toward him
one big young powerfully built roland auburn
he looks dangerous
the other slight hesitant a few steps behind the first one henry lamb
they are both black
need some help
sherman is standing there holding the tire
the two young men are moving steadily toward him
what happened man
you need some help
no i dont think so
thank you very much
sherman is confused
he doesnt move
maria gets behind the wheel of the car
roland reaches slowly into his jacket pocket
he smiles and keeps moving toward sherman
sherman sees the hand moving out of the jacket pocket
he is still frozen
maria blows the horn
sherman wakes up finally
i have to go
he starts to move toward the car still carrying the tire
roland steps in front of him
they both keep moving
where you going with that tire
is this yours
you take it
sherman pushes the tire toward roland
roland pushes it back at him
sherman throws up his arms
the tire bounces off his arms and knocks roland down
im sorry i didnt mean to
honks the horn again and drives the car toward sherman
turns toward the car and bumps into henry
they both fall down
gets to his feet and moves toward the car
opens the car door for sherman
sherman get in this car
jumps into the car pulls the door shut and hits the lock mechanism just as
grabs the door handle on marias side
maria squeals ahead
jerks into motion
but it is now sideways on the ramp and almost hits the guardrail
hits the brakes and puts the car into reverse
is charging toward the car with the tire
he throws it at the windshield
squeals into first gear as the tire bounces off the windshield
looks back at the flying tire and sees
moving around the rear end of the car
maria pulls the wheel hard to the right
the car fishtails
but before he can say it a loud dead sound thok
sherman looks back
as before except that henry is gone
roland is run ning after the car
moving too fast up the ramp toward the traffic on the expressway
maria hits the brakes and then guns the gas
the car careens recklessly into the traffic
other cars swerve and blow their horns as the mercedes forces its way into the flow of traffic heading toward manhattan
a sign above the traffic reading manhattan
pulls off the drive onto th street
the car pulls into a parking space
sherman and maria get out
they move toward a brownstone apartment building
i wonder if we should report this to the police
i mean we were almost robbed and i think maybe its possible you
we hit one of them
there was this kind of
there was this sound
did you hear it
like we hit one of them
did you see him get hit
neither did i
so if the question ever comes up all that happened was two boys blocked the road and tried to rob us and we got away
thats all we know
they go into
climbing the stairs
but if we called the police now
yes lets call them and invite them over here to our little love nest
they would love to get their hands on us
the police and the press and all the rest of the mediarites
newspapers radios televisions
i can see it now
sherman mccoy of park avenue and mrs
arthur ruskin of fifth avenue recuperating after their adventures in the bronx explain that to your wife
you have a point
maria unlocks the door and they go into
id just feel better if
maria drops everything and turns on him
you dont have to feel better sherman
i was the one who was driving
and im saying i didnt hit anybody and im not reporting anything to the police
and if you are a gentleman you will support me in that decision
they are both out of breath
they look at each other
then maria starts to unbutton her blouse
very sexy now we were in the jungle
we were attacked
we fought our way out
we could have been killed
i feel like an animal
you drove the hell out of that car
the hard part was getting into the seat getting over that gear shift
j bonfire of the vanities rev
she opens his shirt
she is suddenly all over him
it was instinct

j bonfire of the vanities rev
to kramer go get him tiger
what is this case doing here
may i approach the bench your honor
who the hell are you
uh kramer sir
youre new here mr
let me explain something to you
this case is what we call a piece of shit
which means loosely translated that you have no evidence
your honor the district attorney mr
i know who the district attorney is
i know mr
and the only reason mr
weiss is interested in the case is because mr
williams over there is a white man who lives in a nice big house in riverdale
i dont follow sir
because this is an election year
because ninety nine percent of the people you shovel through here are black and the other ninety nine percent dont even speak english
but they do vote
p bonfire of the vanities rev
weiss your boss the district attorney who dreams every night that someday he is going to be mayor of new york city what he needs is a white man
he needs to find him book him and throw him in jail
then he looks good to everybody
the press likes it the voters like it even your mother will like it
you follow me now mr
yes your honor
so you go tell your boss the district attorney captain ahab weiss that i know hes out there looking for the great white defendent
williams over there is not it
come out of the courtroom
sarcastic dont take it personally
maybe he didnt like your shoes
are you andriutti
this is detective goldberg
we just come from lincoln hospital
you got a minute
p bonfire of the vanities rev
yeah what do you got
they move down the corridor
we got a kid named henry lamb showed up at the hospital last night with a broken wrist
so they fixed him up in the emergency room and they sent him home
so this morning his mother brings him back hes got a concussion
he goes into a coma and now they classify him likely to die
you talked to him
he was already out
hes in a coma
theres a nurse there busting my balls
she says the kid told his mother he was hit by a car
and the car left the scene
hit and run
the mother tell you this too
p bonfire of the vanities rev
the mother wont talk to us
shes got a shitload of parking tickets and she doesnt want to talk to the police
so why are you coming to us
you got a victim whos unconscious you got no witness no driver you got what we call here a piece of shit
aint that right mr
martin and goldberg look at each other
what we got here is a problem
you ever hear of reverend bacon
kramer this is all yours
ill see you gentlemen later
andruitti turns and goes
in the middle of a hymn
pull back to include rev
bacon in the middle of a tirade
this is a tragedy
a fine young man has been struck down
god fearing church going never in trouble graduating from high school ready for college and somebody comes along some rich white people in a rich white mans car and wham
they run him down and never even stop
now what are we going to do about these parking tickets
pull back to include kramer martin and goldberg
kramer is thrown
first of all reverend is it reverend
is was and always will be
first of all reverend we have no evidence of
this is your evidence
coming up the aisle behind them
oh sorry maam
i didnt see
lamb is not speaking to the police
until we have proper counsel i will speak for her
let me see if i have this straight
the boy was hit by a car
on bruckner boulevard
innocently walking along minding his own business
a clear case of hit and run
but you see you have no witness
without a witness theres no case of anything at all
you got what he told his mother
you may believe it and i may believe it but its not admissable in a court of law
if this boy was born on park avenue and he was run down by two niggers in a pontiac firebird then youd have a case
i work park avenue and i work bruckner boulevard reverend
theres good and bad in both places
now well do everything we can for this lady
but we dont have a hell of a lot to go on
gentlemen i want you to make an investment here
an investment in steam control
because a righteous steam is building up in the souls of my people and that steam is ready to blow
now on judgment day i am your safety valve
because when it blows and it will my friend how grateful you will be that i am on your side the one nigger who can control the steam and save
your lily white ass from being burned off the face of the earth so to speak
you think this car was driven by a white man huh
i seldom think
i just plain know
ill see what i can do
kramer martin and goldberg start to go
bacon puts his arm around mrs
the next time you gentlemen hear from us it will be through our lawyer
lamb goes to kramer
he said it started with an r
that was the first letter
the second letter was an e or a b or maybe a p
those were the first two letters of the license plate
if thats any help to you
of shermans mercedes rph
judy and campbell are with him
no one is talking
we should move out here
have you ever thought i mean what if we moved out of new york
what do you think
do you think we could leave new york
my father did it
you are not your father
she knew how to hurt a guy
he was nothing like his father
his father the lion of dunning sponget and leach
his father who took the subway to work every day of his life
his father who still believed in principals and ethics whose repeated lessons concerning duty debt and responsibility had whistled through his sons head
sherman mccoy was nothing like his father
sherman and judy are having drinks with shermans father and mother
over the following campbell is tugging at judys sleeve asking repeatedly but what does he do
what does daddy do
to which judy replies he sells bonds
sherman is at the same time searching through a newspaper for any news of the accident
mccoy mother and she said to me i like my older customers best of all
theyre the only ones who drink anymore
mccoy my older customers
mccoy father she thought you were twenty five
to judy all of a sudden im married to a white ribbon
sherman what are you looking for in that newspaper
no nothing special
but whats a bond
mccoy delighted oh yes sherman do explain it
your mother and i really want to hear this sherman
a bond is a way of lending people money
lets say you want to build a road or a hospital and you need a lot of money
well you issue a bond
do you build roads
no i dont actually build them
mccoy i think youre in over your head
let me try
darling daddy doesnt build roads or hospitals or anything really
daddy just handles the bonds for the people who raise the money
thats what he said
see just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake
now you didnt bake that cake but every time you hand somebody a slice of that cake a little bit comes off little crumbs fall off
and youre allowed to keep those crumbs
mccoy pointedly and many a man has sold his soul for those little crumbs
enjoying this yes
and thats what daddy does
he passes somebody elses cake around and picks up the crumbs
but you have to imagine a lot of crumbs
and a great golden cake
and a lot of golden crumbs
and you have to imagine daddy running around picking up every little golden crumb he can get his hands on
thats what daddy does
well you can call them crumbs if you want to
thats the best i can do
she gets up abruptly and leaves
mccoy goes after judy
sherman and his father sit there without talking
mccoy of course in my day there was some integrity to it
mccoy now its not about anything is it
except the money
i dont make the rules
mccoy all the more reason not to play the game
were having a little
its nothing serious
o bonfire of the vanities rev
peters face is flat on the bar
he looks bad drunk out of shape disheveled and probably unclean
of course up to this point in our story i was blissfully ignorant
i had no idea of the storm that was gathering
never even heard of sherman mccoy
hadnt the faintest notion that soon his name would be inexorably tied to mine
that his fate would be inextricably bound to my own destiny
nudges peter awake and puts three drinks into peters hands
peter staggers away from the bar carrying the drinks
i had my own problems
and i simply had no idea that sherman mccoy was the solution i was looking for
enter the restaurant
he is handsome and young
she is older and not as pretty as he is
peter intercepts them
come and have a drink with us
im with someone
peter steers them to a table filled with people
and a very pretty someone he is too
introducing them this is filippo chirazzi the artist
this is peter fallow the has been
were a little crowded
why dont you squeeze in next to billy cortez
billy you keep your hands to yourself
now filippo you sit down on top of billy and ill see if i can get caroline to sit down on my face
peter sits in a chair and tries to pull caroline into his lap
caroline grabs filippo
no thanks peter
the last time i sat on your face i ended up with a yeast infection
peter laughs and almost falls off his chair
standing over peter

as they move across the room
you know i was at a dinner party last night
and in the middle of the pudding this four year old child came in pulling a toy wagon around the table and on the wagon was a fresh turd
her own i suppose
and the parents just shook their heads and smiled
ive made a big investment in you peter
time and money
and its not working
now i could just shake my head and smile
but in my house when a turd appears we deal with it
we dispose of it
we flush it away
we dont put it on the table and call it caviar

well i am on to something right now
and i think ive got

he staggers across the street into the city light newspaper office
id had my chance and id blown it away in a bottle
it was over
and i had to face up to that fact
i could always go back home
small town small newspaper
or i could take the time off write a novel or two
or i could slit my wrists
this last suggestion actually seemed the most appealing because in fact it required the least amount of effort
the telephone rings
and then the telephone rang
peter fallow speaking
is on the phone
his assistant sits next to him typing into a word processor
the car is a mini office
you sound terrific
i called the office but nobody seemed to know where you were or even who you were
anything i should know
nothing to know im working at home today thats all
u bonfire of the vanities rev
good good good
i got something i want to talk to you about peter
i think theres a hell of a story in it
thru thru is standing by a bed
in the bed is a midget a man
he has a bandage around his head
standing with albert is another midget a woman
she is crying
and the cause of these little people will always be dear to my heart whether it be discrimination or job security or simply the right to have urinals at the
proper height so that accidents like this do not happen
pull back to include two doctors mcdonald carey and dr
hunter a newspaper reporter jennifer horton and jack devereaux
have you ever thought of giving up the law and becoming an actor
i am an actor
and a damn good one too

albert shakes hands
when the rights of any people are threatened no matter how big or how small albert fox will always be on the case
u bonfire of the vanities rev
your help is greatly appreciated albert
not only by us but by all americans
they shake hands
albert then picks up the midget woman and kisses her on the cheek
thank you ladies and gentlemen
and thank you albert fox for being our guest
as everyone applauds
albert shakes hands and moves toward
on the sidelines looking through a folder of papers
approaching cute arent they
u bonfire of the vanities rev
and they weigh a ton
you want a drink
you look like you could use one
foxs assistant approaches
they all move toward the exit
do you want to cancel city college
i got to do it
to peter for one thing its the only place i can still get laid
these girls all want to sleep with their fathers
and if youre old and famous and you know how to use a condom theyll fuck your brains out
u bonfire of the vanities rev
fox peter and the assistant come outside and descend the escalator
you look at the henry lamb material
well yeah but
look its an unfortunate situation
but im not altogether sure theres a story in it
a poor innocent black kid walking down the street minding his own business
hit and run
theres a story in it for somebody peter
the black community is up in arms
and im telling you when reverend bacon gets a feather in his ass the shit flies high
yes but whats your interest exactly
im a lawyer peter
i want to see justice done
and of course reverend bacon is a friend of mine
this would be good for him
and knowing a little about your situation i thought if you were the one to break the story
o bonfire of the vanities rev
your boss was at my house for dinner the other night
he said a few things
fox and the assistant get into the limo
the assistant fixes fox a drink from a portable bar
fox throws it down and gives the glass back to the assistant
do you have a daughter
a little girl
does she have a little toy wagon
i think she does
ill have a scotch and water
they get into the limo
the letters re are being punched up and then a series of license plate numbers beginning with those letters appear
i could lose my job for this
what are you going to do with this information
youll read all about it in the newspapers
lets do r
and see what we get
is in his driveway sipping a beer and painting a for sale sign
an corvette is parked in the driveway
he was a student of yours at ruppert high
in your english class
whats he done
he was seriously injured
im a journalist
i write for a newspaper
i dont remember him
what i would like to find out is what kind of student he was
well if i dont remember him i guess he was okay
would you say he was a good student
good doesnt really apply to ruppert high
theyre either cooperative or life threatening
theres no in between
his mother says he was considering going to college
well she means city college
they have an open admissions policy
so if you live in the city and you graduate from high school and youre still breathing they have to take you
well is there anything at all you can tell me about his performance or aptitude anything at all
i got sixty five students in every class
do you have any of his written work
oh jesus there hasnt been any written work at ruppert high since
oh fifteen years
well there must be some record of how he measures up to the others
see youre thinking about grades and honor students and high achievers
we dont make those kinds of comparisons
were just trying to keep them off the street
at ruppert high an honor student is somebody who comes to class and doesnt piss on the teacher
pauses then well by that standard is henry lamb an honors student
well he never pissed on me
so by that standard yes
i guess he must be
is shining shermans shoes and reading the newspaper
i think youre exaggerating the situation bernard
who is cool and confident
on phone the franc is no problem
we can hedge that to next january or to term or both
and then he sees
upside down reading honor student in coma
as sherman tries to read the article upside down and talk to bernard
on phone no
i dont think thats necessary
and then shock as sherman recognizes
of henry lamb dressed in a cap and gown
thru thru is losing control
on phone look bernard
uh weve had a few minor hell theyre not even problems
so lets not get ourselves whipped up into a a a coma
no not you bernard
felix let me see that paper
felix hands him the paper
sherman tries to read the article and talk to bernard at the same time
on phone wait
what do you mean wait
what the hell are you talking about
now you listen to me bernard
we cant wait
weve got to move now
youre raising phantom issues here
it doesnt matter what happens to gold and francs on a day to day basis
weve got to pull ourselves together and just fucking do it
wait a minute
dont leave me
dont leave me
but it was too late
it was gone
six hundred million dollars
on wall street a frantic salesman was a dead salesman
and sherman knew it
he puts down the phone and stares at the newspaper
he sits there in his two thousand dollar saville row suit and his new and lingwood cap toed shoes and he sweats
around him voices come out of the chaotic room
feds buying all coupons
holy fucking shit
i want out
i want out
is standing outside marias apartment building
a cab pulls up
maria gets out
she is carrying a large portfolio type case suitable for transporting a painting
sherman intercepts her
i was just thinking about you
where have you been
showing her the newspaper have you seen this
have you seen this perversion of the truth
dont i get a kiss first
have you read it
oh sherman you know i only read the newspapers spasmodically
now come on in and have a drink
i know just what you need
all of it
and who is this peter fallow
he has everything wrong
they dont even mention the other boy
and what about the ramp and the tire
theyre talking about a little saint here who was on his way to get milk and cookies for his widowed mother
as they go into the building

sherman and maria appear in the doorway
excuse me but what is going on here

o bonfire of the vanities rev
checking a piece of paper miss caroline heftshank
i need you to sign a receipt

he packs up and leaves
maria closes the door after him
that was close
whats going on
caroline pays for this place
its rent controlled
i sublet it for eleven hundred a month
but its not legal
they would love to get caroline out of here
but they have to prove she doesnt live here
you dont think its weird this fellow showed up today
after that unconscionable piece in the paper
you are completely paranoidical
look i have to leave for the airport in twenty minutes
so we dont have much time
you dont think they could possibly trace the car to me
o bonfire of the vanities rev
they dont have the full number they dont have a witness and the only one who could recognize you is in terminal comatosis
there is the other boy however
suppose he came forward
if he was gonna materialize he would have done it by now
and the reason he hasnt is because hes a criminal
would you get my blue jacket out of that closet
sherman gets the jacket
maria starts putting a painting into her portfolio
what a wretched painting
hes a friend of caroline
do you know him
i hope not
god maria it looks like you
how could it be
come on give me a hand
im taking it with me
where are you going
i told you
i have a car coming in oh god ten minutes
we have time for a quickie
what do you say
im upset maria
i just lost million dollars
and possibly my job
i dont feel terrifically sexy at the moment
bonfire of the vanities rev
you know im a sucker for a soft dick
maria you are incorrigible
she kisses him
i suppose we could still go to the police
we could get a very talented lawyer
and put our heads right into the horses mouth
im the one who was driving the car
dont you think im the one who should make the decision
and i say no
nothing is going to come of this little newspaper article

bacon goes to fallow and corsaro
i feel as if we already know each other
you have an exclusive here
you understand me
i could have had every newspaper and t
station spreading this news thinly too thinly across the airways
but i have chosen only you two
and i expect big coverage in depth coverage
j bonfire of the vanities rev
going back to the van well then lets get to work
look reverend arent you afraid we may be trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill here
i mean honestly
honesty has nothing to do with this mr
this is show business
and ive never known the two to go hand in hand
well i am a journalist

bacon leaves peter
a silvery shaft with bright orange cable wrapped around it rising two and a half stories above the street now
people start coming out of the buildings to see whats going on
o bonfire of the vanities rev
thru thru speaks to the crowd
brothers and sisters
i stand before you with a heart that is broken
and i stand before you with a heart that is angry
heart broken because our brother our neighbor our son henry lamb has been stuck down in the prime of his young life
and now he lies in a hospital broken like my heart
but my heart is also angry
angry because the driver of that car did nothing for him
and neither did the police
and neither did this man mr
bacon holds up a weiss campaign poster a photo of weiss reading this man has turned his back on henry lamb
and i for one am not going to stand for it
during the above a group of kids are pushing and shoving and laughing behind bacon trying to get on camera
also during bacons speech
passing out placards to rev
weiss justice is white justice
lamb slaughtered by indifference
hit n run n lie to the people
approaches fallow while bacon is speaking
hes something isnt he
j bonfire of the vanities rev
he certainly is
but listen hes on the level with this one isnt he
i mean this is a legitimate story
i mean this henry lamb is
was is a nice kid
no record neighbors seem to like him an honor student
no question about it
because well i dont give a shit but hes gonna be a saint by the time we get through with him
so it would be good if it were true
is being led by rev
bacon to the forefront
the crowd goes quiet
the choir sings
bacon puts annie in front of the crowd as if he were introducing a queen or a saint
v bonfire of the vanities rev
dressed in black looking small and frail
slowly she raises her right arm as if to wave
and then her hand changes to a clenched fist and she screams
the crowd goes berserk screaming with her
a man in the crowd hurls a jar of mayonnaise at the poster of abe weiss
as it splatters
kramer weiss ray andriutti and several aides are watch ing the tv coverage of the demonstration
look at this shit

theyre throwing shit right in my face
weiss flips a channel

and while authorities are dragging their feet the protesters were sending a message to bronx district attorney and mayoral candidate abe weiss if you dont launch an investigation well do
thats my name
thats my own fucking name
this is a fuck up
who the hell are you
on tv we see corsaro interviewing albert fox whos at his limo with his aide

and of course whatever i can do to help mrs
lamb i will do
reacts now theyve got albert fox with them
weiss switches channel to an anchorwoman
behind her a graphic portrays a mercedes and licence plate number with five question marks
while at the same time sources at motor vehicle say there are less than mercedes with plates beginning with the key letters
re rb or rp
there was no comment from the district attorneys office about reverend bacons demand for justice
meanwhile protestors are threatening if bronx district attorney and mayoral candidate abe weiss doesnt launch an investigation quote well do it ourselves
and how did they get this information out of motor vehicle
whose side are they on
calm down abe
we had this information a week ago
then why arent we doing anything
why arent we tracing the car
what am i the wizard of oz i dont know anything
trace the car what for
we dont have a witness
we dont even know where it happened
we dont even know if it happened
v bonfire of the vanities rev
trace the car ray
we dont have a case even if we find the car
even if we find the owner and the owner says oh yeah gee yeah i hit this kid yeah the other night and yeah i didnt stop and i didnt
i did it
i did it
then we have a case
just trace the fucking car
weiss sits down looking sadly at the television
yesterday i was a respected jewish liberal
ten minutes of news like this and all of a sudden im a hymie racist pig
the crowd screaming justice
the italians will love this the irish too
and the wasps
they love this shit more than anybody
they love laughing at me
and they wont even know what theyre laughing at
he goes to the window
the sun is setting over the new york skyline
all the rich sons of bitches
they still think they own this city
they sit in their co ops park avenue fifth beekman place snug like a bug twelve foot ceilings one wing for them one for the help
they think money is going to protect them
stupid sons of bitches
id like to light a bonfire under all their lily white asses
let them see what this feels like
let the whole third world see the smoke and come after them
let them feel what its like when every puerto rican west indian cuban korean chinese albanian filippino black man from every corner of every borough you dont think the future
knows how to cross a bridge
turns and faces his aides alright
now this is what were going to do
were going to turn this thing around
if it kills us
were going to prove to these black motherfuckers excuse my language howard
smiles acknowledgement of the apology
were going to prove to these niggers that this administration loves them
no matter what it takes
i am no racist hymie
by november theyre going to be thinking of me as the first black district attorney of bronx county
theyre going to beg me to be mayor
were going to walk away with that election
thats what were going to do
if we have to screw every white asshole from albany to park avenue thats what were going to do
thru thru reading park ave
gets out of a taxi and walks into
are talking to the doorman as sherman approaches
sorry to bother you
im detective martin
this is detective goldberg
were investigating an automobile accident
maybe you heard about it
martin holds up a copy of the city light article
oh yes yeah
we said my wife said good lord we have a mercedes and the license starts with an r
you and a lotta people
the elevator arrives
are you going up sir
is this a bad time
not at all
we just need to ask a few questions
can you tell us if your car was in use the night this happened
when exactly was it
tuesday a week ago
i dont know
let me think
id have to figure
anybody else use your car
and the people at the garage
you leave the car with the keys and they park it
could we go there and take a look at it
the elevator stops
the doors open
unlocks the apartment door
soon as we leave here
we could take a look
theres things thats consistent with an incident like this
we dont find those things we move on down the list
and were out of your hair
leads martin and goldberg inside
so you want to take a look at the car then
we dont have a description of a driver
so we gotta look for the car
and that means bothering a lot of innocent people
were sorry about the inconvenience
but its a routine sort of thing
but if it is a routine well i should i guess i ought to
well follow the routine thats appropriate to me to someone with a car in this situation
martin and goldberg look at each other
then they follow sherman into
i dont follow
well i mean if you have a routine in an investigation like this i dont know how these things work but there must also be a routine for a person
like me an owner of a car with a license number i think thats what i need to consider
we just want to look at the car
thats what i mean
excuse me mr
but is there something you want to tell us
o bonfire of the vanities rev
how do you mean
because if there is now is the time to tell us
before things get complicated
i just think
i think that just to be sure certain safe
let me put it this way if you want to cooperate thats great
if you have reasons for not cooperating then i should tell you that you dont have to say anything
thats your right
if you want you can say nothing at all
you also have the right to an attorney
i mean for that matter if you lacked the funds for an attorney the state would provide you with one free of charge
if thats what you wanted
goldberg sits down on the edge of shermans desk
i guess what i should do is i should
i should talk this over with an attorney
is moving fast as he talks with martin and goldberg
but mainly its the look on his face
aint that the truth marty
all of sudden the bitch starts coming out of him
so i read him his rights as casual as i can do it
o bonfire of the vanities rev
and then he sits down on the guys desk
whatd he do
nothin at first
but hes confused
and his eyes are getting bigger and hes double talking like a son of a bitch
im thinking theres something there
as they reach weiss
i think we got him
what do you got
we got him
you think its him
well we think so yeah but
we got him
this guy is park avenue
his old man ran dunning sponget and leach
hes got his name in the columns
his wife is a fucking socialite
does this put an end to this white justice shit
ray andruitti interrupts him
o bonfire of the vanities rev
we got zip on this guy
i think hes the type we could smoke out
bring him in for questioning
you got nothing here
your only witness is in a hospital likely to die
dont listen to this shit abe
you got to get to manhattan
you got a speech to make
ill tell you what you got to do sir
youve got to send a signal out to the poor people of this city
you got to let them know that justice is blind
you got to let them know that if youre white and rich you get the same treatment you get when youre black and poor
you got to give people hope
you mean we nail the wasp
to the wall
i like this man
i like him
whats the kids condition
any chance hell regain consciousness
what if he does
he cant talk
hes breathing from a tube down his throat
but maybe he can point
o bonfire of the vanities rev
i got an idea
we take a picture of sherman mccoy over to the hospital to this kid
and three or four other guys white guys and we put them by the bed the pictures
and the kid comes to
and he points to mccoys picture
and he keeps pointing
nobody believes what theyre hearing except kramer
that might work
its a long shot but it might work
an aide rushes up to kramer and pulls him aside
what do you want
to weiss youll kill him
he wakes up out of a coma and sees four white men in suits and ties staring at him from the end of the bed hell shit and die
its worth a try
i dont believe what im hearing
some poor gook with a tube down his throat pointing at a picture
thats your case
its never gonna stand up
screams i know that ray
i know that
i just want to bring the guy in
just bring him in
we get the press
we get the attention
then we can relax and do the right thing
look at me abe
watch my mouth
read my lips
we cannot do that
o bonfire of the vanities rev
weiss growls in frustration
kramer leaves the aide and goes to weiss
i think we got a witness
shouting over the noise what
i think we got a mother fucking witness
is having his mug shots taken
he is immediately recognizable as the other young man who was with henry lamb
bonfire of the vanities rev
talking to cecil hayden as they watch roland

you just sit tight
thats what you do
look you were recommended as the best criminal lawyer around
im not disagreeing with you
but i didnt come here to
i mean i want to pre empt this whole situation
i dont want it to go any further
what does that mean
it means i want to take the initiative
i want to go to the police with maria mrs
ruskin and just tell them exactly what happened
i mean i dont know about the law but i feel morally certain that we did what was right in the situation we were in
and i dont see
you wall street honchos are real gamblers
they would devour you
they would eat you up
forget its already a political football
forget the t
and reverend bacon and weiss has an election coming up
forget that and remember that when you work in the d
s office and every day you prosecute people with names like tiffany latour and sancho rodriguez and chong wong and shabazz kazan tamali you are dying to get your hands
on a nice white couple like you and mrs
biscuit city ehhh
you open your mouth and they will arrest you
and they will make a big show out of arresting you

going to cost us three hundred and forty six dollars

the last scene of don giovanni is being played out
the commandatori has the don in his grip urging him to repent
the don refuses
the music thunders threateningly
in a box with judy and leonard and inez bavardage
sherman is transfixed by what he is seeing on the stage
he flips through his libretto
and the word repent in english and italian
as the floor opens up around don giovanni
flames and demons reach for him
breaking into a sweat
he reaches for judy
as don giovanni screams and falls into the jaws of hell
depicts a jungles scene a lion is eating a just killed zebra
a pack of hyenas are hovering
looking at the scene
the museum party is in full gear
there he is don juan in the vise like grip of fate facing his crime facing his entire life of selfish consumption and profligate wasting of himself and others
sherman turns and bumps into aubrey spilling his drink
grabs him by the arm and pulls him into her conversation with aubrey

i see the deadly thunderbolt poised above his head
i see the fatal abyss open before him
during the above sherman sees
is being introduced to maria on the other side of the room
extricates himself from aubrey
speaking to judy
my wife lives on airplanes
she goes back and forth to italy like a ping pong ball

the group laughs and turns away from sherman
i was arrested last year in montreal for pissing on a tree
as judy tries to rejoin the group
sherman couldnt you try just once to be a little bit interesting
sherman pulls her away
i want you to meet aubrey buffing
hes on the short list for the nobel prize
he has aids
youll love him
bonfire of the vanities rev
sherman we are alone in the middle of the room
a married couple talking to each other
you simply dont do this
now go and mingle
she leaves him
walking and speaking to a woman
as they pass an enormous table of food
and even when repentence is offered he refuses
he refuses to deny his life
the food the drink the flesh fatal as they may be he cannot resist them

as she leaves with maria she grabs aubrey buffing and steers him toward sherman
sherman have you met aubrey buffing
he has aids
shakes shermans hand again like so many of us now with death and retribution waiting for us
yet we go on whirling about each other
sherman is looking past aubrey
goes to arthur whispers something in his ear
they leave quickly
for a brief moment she looks back at
walking with aubrey trying to see where maria went
we are unable to stop until death itself takes us into his arms and burns us with the fever of living dragging us like don juan into the bonfires of
the words of the ghost ringing in our ears
thru thru comes out of the building and stands waiting as the rain pours down on this bleak day
a police car pulls up
sherman gets inside
as sherman climbs into the back seat
be careful of your clothes

they stick to your clothes
how do you feel
you said this was just a formality
they promised me

off by himself close to the curb where
pulls up containing sherman
peter peers into the car
excuse me mister mccoy
whats going on here
near the door to the building comes alive
slowly at first
they turn their heads toward the car and then they start moving walking running racing toward the car
as this mob of reporters and cameramen attack the car in the pouring rain
you dont know me but im
but peter is buried in the onslaught before he can say another word
get out and get that door open or well never get him out of the fucking car

someone sticks a camera into shermans face
goldberg martin and killian try to push through the mob
goldberg swings at a camera and knocks it down
hey sherman how you going to plead
peter fallow falls to the ground
sherman and goldberg step on him as they push ahead
you ever been arrested before
whos the brunette

a microphone is shoved into shermans face

dont talk to anybody especially in the pens
ill be upstairs when they bring you up for arraignment

pulls himself up off the ground
he is more dazed than hurt
a shermans cuffs are removed
b the contents of shermans pockets are laid on the table
c sherman removes his belt
his pants drop to his hips
d sherman removes his shoelaces and drops them on a table
x bonfire of the vanities rev
coming out of his shoes as he tries to walk
walking through a metal detection gate
give me your coat
try it again
sherman walks back through the gate
the alarm sounds again
what the fuck
wait a minute
sherman looks terrified
i aint going to touch you
just bend over at the waist and back through the gate
sherman bends over at a ninety degree angle and holding up his trousers shuffles backwards through the gate
a little farther little farther
as shermans head goes through the gate the alarm sounds
goldberg jumps up and down and claps his hands with delight
look at this
do that again
x bonfire of the vanities rev
sherman repeats the humiliating action
when finally his head reaches the gate the alarm sounds again
its his head
swear to christ
its his head
open your mouth
sherman opens his mouth
goldberg grabs his jaw and angles it toward the light
look in there
you want to see some metal
set of teeth look like a change maker
they ever let you on an airplane
x bonfire of the vanities rev
is led quickly toward the cells
his shoes flop his pants sag he trips and almost falls
a cell door opens
sherman is pushed inside
he turns to look back
the door bangs shut
is calling out
opens a side door
then the sound of feet shuffling
finally sherman appears
he looks like a man who has been dragged through hell his body his clothing the look in his eyes
he staggers toward the bench
seated in the front row of the spectators
is facing judge white
killian is next to him
kramer is representing the district attorneys office
mccoy you know the charges that are being brought against you
we want to know how you plead to the charges
i am sorry
j bonfire of the vanities rev
i am very sorry

for my life
i am truly sorry
your honor the defendant is under extreme stress
he pleads not guilty
i repent all the sins of my past life
just shut up sherman
defendant pleads not guilty
sudden commotion in the courtroom
sherman turns to look at
press and spectators are already buzzing out of control
bail has been set at
lock him up
bang it shut
we do not believe it will serve the interests of justice to allow this defendant to go free on a token bail
your honor mr
kramer knows very well
given the emotions of the community
j bonfire of the vanities rev
this is patent nonsense
bail has already been agreed to
the spectators are booing and yelling at killian to shut up
bangs the gavel quiet
where the hell do you think you are
i have a petition from the community with an appeal to the district attorney that justice be done
weiss himself has instructed me to request bail in the amount of
cheering and applauding yeah

until then i am releasing mr
mccoy under a bond in the amount of

kramer i have spoken
but to the cause of the people as well
it ill behooves the criminal justice system
j bonfire of the vanities rev
kindly behoove me no ill behooves
kramer the court directs you to shut up
the crowd goes crazy screaming and booing and chanting
put him in jail
killian grabs sherman and pulls him toward the exit
the court officers form a wedge to help them through the screaming mob
say your prayers park avenue tear you a new one you mine needlenose
count every breath baby
who is humiliated
is sitting on the steps of the courthouse
he is still covered with mud from having been trampled earlier
he takes a long swig from a bottle wrapped in a paper bag
he is drunk
it was too much for me
all of it
sherman mccoy had been swept away from me
before i could even speak to him
and as the day progressed i began to appreciate the power the magnitude of the force that had been unleashed by my little story
of reporters television people photographers etc
they run up the steps past peter as they head toward the entrance to the courthouse
as they pass
hes coming out
dodges the onslaught pulls himself up and starts moving in the opposite direction
yapping at the heels of their prey
and i was one of them
well let them have it
enough is enough
i was finished
i summoned what little dignity i had left and decided to go home
excuse me do you know where i can find a taxi
who has just come out the side entrance of the building
peter is flabbergasted
i know that
what are you
i need a taxi
you need to get out of here
change direction and start moving away from the front entrance and toward the side entrance
as they go
the other way
hes coming out the back
see the mob moving toward them
fallow grabs sherman and pulls him toward a subway
i dont normally ride the subway
especially on a first date
but we dont really have a choice
they enter the subway
sherman is dazed still in shock
he looks very fragile
are you alright
look i owe you an apology
no you were very helpful
you dont know who i am
i should go
just sit down a minute
ill get you home
peter offers sherman his bottle
would you like a drink
i happen to have a little something
sherman looks with some caution at the bottle in the paper bag
what are they going to do
sherman smiles and takes a drink
he looks around the car
its a rough crowd
does this train go anywhere near park avenue
not in a million years
my father took the subway every day of his life
but he didnt live in the south bronx
they both laugh
i look terrible
you look like shit
and you smell too
i think when i was in the jail i pissed in my pants
they laugh again
sherman gets caught somewhere between laughing and crying
he starts to lose control
take it easy
i cant think
o bonfire of the vanities rev
have another drink
sherman takes a long drink
clatters through the darkness
as the car slows down
sherman is slightly drunk
and then this newspaper thing started this peter fallow person and all the facts were wrong total disregard for the truth
why do they do this
this is you
youll be right on lexington avenue
they call me by my first name
like they know me
like they own me
newspapers lawyers police people i dont even know
how did i get to be so important
youre not important
youre just dinner
you know what i mean
and a week from now a month nobody is even going to remember what they ate
the car stops
sherman steps onto the platform
peter remains in the car
sherman looks back at him
i should have called the police right away when it happened
but i couldnt you see
it wasnt really my decision
how do you mean
i mean i wasnt driving the car
bonfire of the vanities rev
the doors to the train start to close
peter tries to stop them
wait a minute
wait a minute
as the doors close and the train pulls away
are marching up and down in front of shermans apartment building
among them are five very tall black men play ing with a basketball
stops near the building
the basketball flies toward him
he catches it
before anyone sees him he enters through the service entrance
looks like he feels unclean unshaven slightly drunk his clothes soiled torn and disheveled
he seems to stoop slightly under the weight of his humiliation
open and suddenly we are in the midst of
in high gear
most of the guests are recognizable from the previous party at the museum
sherman is shocked
but before he can get his bearings
you sly fox
great to see you
they all turn and applaud
as sherman moves through them
sherman my boy
whatever you do dont let the newspapers get you down
bonfire of the vanities rev
thats all they are
they hover over the faces
you take a swipe at them they run away
but they always come back to the shit
and i always thought of you as such a dull person
sherman has anybody talked to you about television
wed have to play down the racial thing and try to make you a little more sympathetic
you know sympathetic
i didnt mean to interrupt anything
gene asked me to come by
i havent really been able to talk to anybody
bonfire of the vanities rev
he just wanted you to know anything we can do
i should be down there in a day or so
oh that wont be necessary
thats what i came to
i was sent to tell you
i mean you dont have to
i mean you shouldnt come down
i mean they dont want you to come down
but between all this and the way you handled bernard on the giscard deal
i mean six hundred million
thats final huh
well the firm feels
follow him into
finds judy and bonita putting dinner together
what is going on
this is a dinner party
it was planned weeks ago
if you ever bothered to look at your calendar
but judy i mean under the circumstances
bonfire of the vanities rev
i know the whole story
i heard it saw it all on television
you betrayed us sherman
on the other hand i am going to chair the museum benefit thanks to you and your escapades on the public airways
what can i say
life goes on
i can only make the best of an absolutely appalling situation and carry on
but can you forgive me
i suppose i can forgive anything but not television
im leaving you sherman
after the party
now if youll excuse me we have guests
as she sails into the kitchen she sees judy leave
oh my darling is this a bad time
i beg your pardon
what am i saying
of course its a bad time
but i just wanted to see if i can be of any help
well thats very kind of you
you know i havent been in this apartment since the mccleods had it
that was before the kittridges
i hope im not being out of place
not at all
anyway thank you
no really anything i can do
with the apartment is what i mean
i find people often need to be as liquid as they can in these situations and i know i can get you seven and a half right at this moment
fabled aristocratic tycoon its the celebrity appeal
if we act quickly this kind of opportunity doesnt come along every day
you have to ride the wave
i have to
comes out of the kitchen
as he tries to make his way through the living room trying to avoid the guests
sherman keeps walking
how are you
sorry to interrupt your dinner
not at all
the more the merrier
ive been in touch with the co op board well most of them and we want you to know you have our support
you know at first i wanted to die
standing there in court people calling my name
hard to believe
and then i thought i have a gun
follow them into
goes to the closet and pulls out the shotgun
here it is
sherman weve known each other a long time
we went to buckley together
my father knew your father
i speak as a friend
but also as president of the board
is that a gun
i wonder if i can get both barrels into my mouth
thats what i was thinking
and how do you pull the trigger
i read somewhere about a man who took off his shoe and pulled the trigger with his toe
this cant be a comfortable situation for you
and where would i do it
who would find me
have you considered
changing residence until things quiet down
you want me to leave
this is my home
i understand that
this is the only safe place i have
people are threatening my life
i have to protect myself
he loads the gun and fills his pockets with shells
there are people demonstrating in front of our building
black people with basketballs
youre putting everyone at risk
its not your fault
but that doesnt alter the facts
follow sherman and pollard out of the study to
alter the facts
the facts are that i have no place else to go
and you want me to move out
is that what youre saying pollard
you want me to move out of my home
the guests begin to listen to this exchange
you are a shareholder in a cooperative
look were not asking you to do anything of a permanent nature
why dont you move out pollard
if youre so fucking terrified
and you can start by moving out of this apartment right now
sherman points the gun at pollard
i came here in good faith
oh pollard you were a ridiculous fat blowhard at buckley and youre a ridiculous fat blowhard now
everyone watches as sherman holds pollard at gunpoint and steers him out of the room
i will have to enforce the provision concerning unacceptable situations
another word out of you pollard and theres going to be an unacceptable situation right up your ass
the guests applaud
sherman turns to face them
and that goes for the rest of you too
all of you
the guests look confused they dont really believe him
sherman aims the gun at the ceiling
waves the smoking shotgun at them
stinking lot of anorexic parasites
get out of my house
bonfire of the vanities rev
he fires another shot
the room clears
judy comes running from the kitchen
out of my house out of my life
the dog comes barking into the room
judy grabs her
say goodbye to daddy
see you later
as they go you can see him on television
sherman reloads and keeps firing until everyone is gone
lamps explode furniture splinters plaster falls
sherman mccoy is dead
sherman mccoy of park avenue and wall street and southampton gone
i will never be sherman mccoy again
thru thru who looks very depressed
that same evening just a few blocks away i was being praised and congratulated
it should have been a very triumphant yours truly at leicesters
but it wasnt
pull back to include peter surrounded by fawning packs of well wishers including gerald moore
my little encounter with sherman mccoy was spoiling everything
the truth has a way of doing that
bonfire of the vanities rev
beautiful stuff peter
he looks like a real killer this mccoy fellow
you can see it in the photographs
you can see it in his chin
arrogant son a bitch isnt he
i hope they throw the book at him
evelyn moore approaches gerald
shall we have peter here come along with us
gerald and evelyn lead peter toward the back dining room
i want to give this story our full attention peter
it makes us look better and better the more we do for this lamb family
poor little lambs poor little fuzzy wuzzy wogs
caroline heftshank intercepts them
she is very drunk
excuse me peter
theres a phone call for you upstairs in the office
peter makes excuses to gerald and evelyn and follows caroline away
come into the office
wheres the phone
bonfire of the vanities rev
i wanted to see you alone
im going to do you a favor
dont tell me im finally going to get into your panties
you dont deserve this peter
but im going to tell you something
she reaches under her skirt and pulls off her panties
she drops them on the floor
im sort of with some people tonight
do you remember my pretty little italian friend
yes i do
franco or federico
the little shit
caroline climbs up on the desk lifts her skirt and sits down on the xerox machine
caroline youre absolutely soused
well filippo has run off with a little slut you should know about
she switches on the machine which starts photocopying her twat
caroline isnt that dangerous
or at least unsanitary
shut up peter
youre not listening
her name is maria ruskin
bonfire of the vanities rev
she was subletting my apartment
she was also subletting filippo
and as it turns out she was also in the car with sherman mccoy when the accident happened
i never joke
she was in the car
but how do you know all this
the apartment was bugged
they had a wire in the intercom
they were trying to prove that i wasnt living there
which i wasnt
now ive lost the apartment and the boyfriend
you dont know where they are
but im trusting you to find them
and when you do
give them this
tell them this is the little lady who turned them in
she takes one of the xerox copies and hands it to peter
caroline looks at the xerox copy
maybe i should advertise
points fallow toward arthur ruskins table
monsieur ruskin is already here
seated at a table as peter approaches
the maitre d seats them side by side on a banquette
bonfire of the vanities rev

what do you want to eat
are bringing the main course to the table
arthur is guzzling wine as he talks
peter is bored silly
but the best is just a few weeks ago one of these jackass pilots he lands long and the plane goes off the runway
i was there
i was on the plane
were going into mecca see
and the plane is full of arabs and all these animals sheep goats chickens
they wont travel without their animals
we had to put plastic in the cabins
you know they urinate they defecate
anyway the plane goes off the runway and we hit the sand with a hell of a jolt and the right wing tip digs into the sand and the plane
skids around in a circle
degrees before we stop
were scared shitless
and we look into the cabin and theres everybody calm quiet theyre picking up their luggage and their animals and theyre looking out the window at the little fire that
started on the wing and theyre waiting for the doors to open like nothing happened
and then it dawns on me
they think this is normal
he starts to laugh as he talks
they think this is the way you stop an airplane
you stick one wing in the sand and you spin around until you stop
coughing as he laughs harder and harder what do they know
they never rode in an airplane
they think this is how you do it
peter tries to laugh with arthur
but arthurs coughing turns into a spasm
he pushes his head back against the banquette
he seems to be humming
and then his head drops forward and he slumps against peter
he tries to signal a waiter
the maitre d approaches the table
ruskin seems to have suffered some kind of well i dont know
very disappointed oh dear
i think youd better call someone
arthur drops forward suddenly his face hitting his plate
a woman at the next table squeals
attention sil vous plait
two waiters help the maitre d pull the table out
arthur slips off his plate and falls onto the floor
some people notice
but in general the activity in the room continues
the maitre d gives orders to the waiters
a man approaches peter
is he choking
let me give him the heimlich maneuver
excuse me monsieur roberts
you are not a doctor
and there are legal complications
yes i see but
for your own protection and mine and my restaurant we leave monsieur ruskin in the hands of god and we go back to our escargots
well somebody has to do something
peter tries to perform the heimlich maneuver on ruskin
we have called the police
an ambulance is coming
there is nothing more we can do
would you like some coffee or dessert
to peter gee buddy
i think hes dead
peter lets go of ruskin
ruskin slides to the floor dead
drops a card in front of peter laddition sil vous plait
the bill monsieur
and we do not accept credit cards
bonfire of the vanities rev
comes out of customs
she is wearing black and has a veil over her face
they walk as they talk
my name is peter fallow
i just wanted to offer my sympathy
through tears how very kind
did you know arthur
ah well yes
i was actually quite close to him when he died
ive reprobated myself over and over again for being away
move toward marias waiting limousine
well thank you for the kind words
i must go now
just one other thing
i understand youre a friend of sherman mccoy
i gather you were not only in the car with him when he had his unfortunate accident in the bronx
but i understand you were driving
maria turns and looks at him hard and cold
sherman would never tell you that
i was hoping you might tell me exactly what happened that night
i am here for my husbands funeral
now go away
she gets into the car
fallow watches the car pull away
the headline on the city lights reads is lying in a coma a beatific smile on his face
around the bed
what kind of muckracking yellow journalist are you
you print a story like this without so much as a by your leave to me or to reverend bacon here
who the hell do you think you are
bonfire of the vanities rev
tearfully please you have to keep your voices down
look dont you understand
it is very possible that sherman mccoy was not driving that car
and i can almost prove it
this is our case
he gestures toward henry lamb
its the hospital thats the guilty party
what are you talking about
a young man comes in here with a cerebral concussion and they treat him for a broken wrist
that is our case
that is the lawsuit that we are going to bring against this hospital
that is what we have been working toward all this time
and you are confusing the issue
do you understand me
but christ albert this is a great story
this is my exclusive
and its also the truth
its a little late for you to start telling the truth isnt it pete
i cant just drop this now
i cant just let it go
bonfire of the vanities rev
sure you can
theres gonna be other stories other exclusives
well take care of you
youre our boy peter
you take care of us and well take care of you
i promise you thats going to be a very profitable relationship for all of us
suddenly annie starts to weep
annie i know that nothing can heal the wound that you have suffered
but ten million dollars in damages will certainly make your grief more comfortable
well yes i could use a few things reverend thank you
i been worried about my clothes for instance
i feel that the presentation of my person should be carefully designed
as a model to black mothers everywhere i think i should have the right wardrobe
so if you could have mr
foxs limousine pick me up in the morning i could do some shopping
ill need some furniture too
and a new refrigerator
and although i should probably continue to live in that shithole of an apartment at least until after the lawsuit is settled i would like to start looking now for
a co op in manhattan for me and my son something with a view of the river and preferably in a neighborhood that is at least upwardly mobile
pause as they all look at her
o bonfire of the vanities rev
how could i turn my back on the plight of this grief stricken woman
how could i turn my back on a profitable relationship
i was touched to the depths of what was left of my soul
and my bank account
thru thru the headline reads so i printed their little story
well why not
why not be the best whore in the house
and anyway i was beginning to see even greater possibilities in my situation
the shades are drawn the room is dark
weiss sits at his desk
andriutti and kramer are with him
quietly now theyre going to sue the hospital
all they want is money
imagine using a terrible tragedy like this for your own selfish motives
it is terrible
shut up you asshole
o bonfire of the vanities rev
whats happening to my case
the people versus sherman mccoy
where is my issue
where is my cause
where is my hope
i think we better talk to this mrs
you go to the press
you tell them were going to question the woman and if she is the woman who was in the car she faces possible charges etcetera etcetera
and you mr
wise guy know it all shitface youre the one got us into this youre going to get us out
you go to this broad you tell her shes in a whole lot of trouble lay it on
but but but if she is willing to cooperate if she will say what we want her to say then we will grant her immunity
go on go
what are you waiting for
well today is her husbands funeral
exploding i dont care if today is her mothers bar mitzvah you go talk to her
as kramer exits
approaching the building
bonfire of the vanities rev
is knocking on a door that has a sign reading super intendant
the door opens
we recognize the workman who was fixing the intercom in marias apartment
i understand you been doing some creative wiring in this building
peter and leach continue talking
in less than three minutes i had what i was looking for
it was more than a story
i had the makings of a book here
a great book
a prize winning effort
all i needed was a big finish
leach opens the door wide and fallow steps into the apart ment
as the door closes
so i shipped off a little present to sherman mccoys lawyer and i waited for the fireworks
thru thru f int
mccoy apartment close on cassette player f killians hand flips the switch the tape plays
where are you going
on tape the airport
i told you
i have a car coming in oh god ten minutes
we have time for a quickie
what do you say
how did you get this
bonfire of the vanities rev
killian lets the tape fast forward
on tape i suppose we could still go to the police
we could get a very talented lawyer
on tape and put our heads right into the horses mouth
im the one who was driving the car
dont you think im the one who should make the decision
and i say no
killian switches off the machine
you mean the apartment was wired bugged all that time
i checked it all out
whoever sent me this tape is either a big fan of yours or a not so big fan of maria ruskin
then we have this as evidence
its an illegal tape
the guy who did this could go to jail for this
now if this were your tape it would be legal
but its not
what do you mean my tape
well if you were wired and you recorded your own conversation that would be okay
but there is no way that this tape can be used as evidence in a court of law
then what good is it
r bonfire of the vanities rev
it gave me an idea
an idea about what
an idea about what to wear when you go to this funeral
a procession of limousines pushing through a crowd of press and bystanders to deposit the mourners at the front door
among those arriving we see jed kramer
thru thru dressed in black enters and walks down the aisle
people stop her and offer condolences
comes into the chapel
wearing dark glasses and a raincoat hiding near a door way that leads into an adjacent family room
as maria passes he signals her
follow maria into closes the door as maria enters
whatever are you doing here
im sorry maria
i have to talk to you
bonfire of the vanities rev
you seem to be doing all your talking to the newspapers these days
believe me i had nothing to do with that
we didnt want your name in the papers any more than you did
well here we are sherman
the couple that all new york is talking about
and were not even a couple anymore
i thought youd run out on me
i didnt even know where you went
and i was left sort of holding the bag trying to protect you
would i do that to you
sherman sherman sherman
she embraces him her hands moving toward the hidden recorder
sherman takes both her hands and pulls them to his chest
what are we going to do with you
you have to help me maria
but how can i help you
well i know this may sound like a strange request but you could start by telling the police what really happened
oh sherman you are the sweetest thing
but im not sure anybody knows what really happened
and if anybody does know it certainly isnt me
but you were driving the car that night
i dont remember
isnt it funny how a little thing like that can slip your mind
she kisses him god theres something about funerals that is so stimulating
my panties have been wet all morning
she kisses him again
o bonfire of the vanities rev
is still at the microphone
and now in accordance with the wishes of mr
is moving around trying to find maria
manny leerman will play a medley of arthurs favorite songs
a lounge singer in a pale blue suit hops onto the stage sits at the piano and launches into a totally inappropriate rendition of september in the rain
leaving the viewing room
looking from room to room
is trying to embrace sherman
he remains hunched over trying to stay away from her and keep her hands off his back
whats wrong with you
then why are you all hunched over
her hands slide down his back
maria we have to talk
sherman whats this on your back
this lump this piece of metal this thing on your back

theres some sort of subterfuge afoot here
dont be silly
you are secreting something on your body
i want to see what it is
she rips open his shirt
maria are you crazy
and a wire
she pulls the wire
sherman yelps in pain
as he spins around maria grabs the tapedeck and pulls it off his back

mccoy offers his hand in a handshake
sherman takes his hand
mccoy puts his arm around him and hugs him awkwardly but effectively
what you want to do
theres only one thing i can do
i want to see the truth come out and burn every one of them
and theres only one way to do that
y bonfire of the vanities rev
mccoy what is it
mccoy well you know i have always been a great believer in the truth
ive lived my life as honestly as i know how
i believe in the truth as an essential companion to a man of conscience a beacon in the vast and dark wasteland of our modern world
mccoy and yet if the truth wont set you free yes
is banging his gavel trying to silence the overflowing courtroom
some demonstrators are climbing on the statue to get a better view
on the stand as kramer questions her
and this incident occurred on the ramp to the expressway or on the avenue itself
bonfire of the vanities rev
why on the avenue
right on the street
and was there any obstruction or barricade of any kind that caused the car to stop
nothing like that at all
finally one last question
can you tell us mrs
ruskin who was driving the car when henry lamb was hit
why sherman never let anyone drive his car
sherman mccoy was driving the car
a roar goes up from the crowd
sherman and killian at the defense table
in the audience bacon fox gerald moore weiss and finally peter fallow taking notes
and there it was
the end of sherman mccoy
and it wasnt the ending i was hoping for
he was finished
she might as well have put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger
there was no hope now
the darkness closed in around him
and then i noticed the most peculiar thing
sherman was smiling
j bonfire of the vanities rev
and i wanted to report the incident but he wouldnt let me
he said he was driving and it was his decision to make
you were surprised
i was shocked
there are certain qualities of virtue that i admire in a human being virtues that i hope i possess myself
suddenly marias recorded voice blasts into the courtroom
on tape we have time for a quickie
what do you say sherman
on tape i dont feel terrifically sexy at the moment
white bangs his gavel
everyone is looking around for the source of the sound
what in hell
on tape you know im a sucker for a soft dick
on tape maria you are incorrigible
the court goes crazy
white regains order
sudden silence in time for everyone to hear
on tape i supppose we could still go to the police
we could get a very talented lawyer
j bonfire of the vanities rev
on tape and put our heads right into the tigers mouth
im the one who was driving the car
dont you think im the one who should make that decision
fallow starts to laugh
kramer pulls shermans briefcase off a chair revealing a hidden tape recorder
he bangs and kicks the recorder trying to make it stop
maria faints on the stand
killian is amazed and amused
he looks at sherman
killian takes the tape from the recorder
approach the bench
the courtroom grows more quiet
whose tape is this mr
that tape is mine sir
killian is shocked
they continue speaking in whispers
if your honor please
shut up mr
mccoy i remind you that you are still under oath
now did you record this conversation
oh yes sir i did
i recorded this conversation on this tape
this is my tape of my conversation
i recorded it
yes sir three bags full
get out of my face
all of you
sherman killian and kramer return to their seats
the court starts screaming again
i want some fucking order in here
j bonfire of the vanities rev
he bangs the gavel until the noise subsides
screaming so you insist on testing the will of this court
now you shut up and sit down
all of you
in the case of the people versus sherman mccoy the grand jury has returned an indictment
based on the evidence contained in this recording
holds up the tape and pursuant to my authority to supervise the grand jurys proceedings
j bonfire of the vanities rev
i am ordering the indictment dismissed in the interests of justice without prejudice and with leave to re present by the district attorney
the courtroom explodes
screams fill the air racist
the sound is deafening
sherman and killian shake hands
the demonstrators are chanting justice
reporters and photographers rush into the room
rises on the bench like an eagle
he pounds the gavel repeatedly
we want justice
we want justice
you want justice
ill give you justice
finally the courtroom goes quiet
white looks around
everyone is quiet
and then a single voice rings out
you racist pig
you dare call me a racist
well i say to you you a mob who dares to come into these walls i say to you what does it matter the color of a mans skin
if witnesses perjure themselves
and a prosecutor a sworn officer of the court enlists the perjurers and a district attorney throws a man to the mob and lawyers carve up that man for his
and men of the cloth men of god take the prime cuts
now you tell me silence
s bonfire of the vanities rev
i dont hear you
he comes down off the bench facing the mob
ill tell you what justice is not
justice is not the will of the few and its not the will of the many
justice is not politics
justice is the law
and the law is mans feeble attempt to set down the principles of decency
and decency is not a deal
or an angle or a contract or a hustle or a campaign or a trick or a bid for sympathy
decency is not the beast that bays for money power dominion position votes and blood
decency is what your mother taught you
decency is in your bones
do i make myself clear
now go home
go home now
be decent people
a moment of quiet as white comes down and faces sherman
youre free to go mr
as another blood curdling roar goes up from the crazed mob
they close in on the judge and sherman
with a bullhorn egging on the crowd
you bald headed uncle tom pussy
to the crowd are you going to take this park avenue justice
closing in on sherman and the judge
the judge grabs sherman and pulls him through the door
s bonfire of the vanities rev
come out of the courtroom pursued by the spectators
they are pressed against a huge statue of blind justice at the end of the corridor
rushing at sherman and the judge from different sides
in the mob pressing toward sherman and the judge
were not finished with you mccoy
youll be back in this courtroom
this decision will be appealed until i see you behind bars
you hear me judge
get your fucking face out of my way
this fucking face is going to see you shining shoes in grand central station
more pushing until
people scream and scatter
the statue shatters as it hits the floor
the bronze sword slides across the floor and comes to rest at shermans feet
the judge is hit on the head by some debris
he stumbles blinded by the plaster dust
sherman grabs the sword
taunting the judge this fucking face is going to see you selling pencils you black son of a bitch
s bonfire of the vanities rev
sherman whacks kramer with the sword
kramer falls away
sherman helps the judge down the corridor
coming out of the courtroom intercepting sherman
you shall not escape
you shall live in fear on this island in the mighty sea of people for the people and justice are waiting for you
sherman whacks bacon
the choir women start to wail
fox approaches sherman offering his card
youve been woefully misrepresented here mr
i think you should give me a call
sherman whacks fox with the sword and continues down the corridor with the judge
giving an interview for a tv news team
and i promise you and the people of this city that henry lamb will not be forgotten
henry lamb will live like the alamo as a symbol of slaughtered innocence
weiss sees sherman and attacks him
and this mans name will live in infamy
like adolf hitler
like son of sam
like idi amin
john wilkes booth
sherman smacks weiss with the sword and moves toward the stairs with the judge
s bonfire of the vanities rev
this is going to make one hell of a story
who are you
im peter fallow
im peter fallow
sherman looks at him for a moment
then he lets out a screaming war cry and smacks fallow with the sword
falls to the ground
he looks up
i needed that
move down the stairs and out the iron gates of the court house
pulls the gates shut and slides the sword through the door handles locking the crowd inside the courthouse
they pound on the gates as the courtroom guards try to hold them back
are you alright
he walks up to the iron gates
the faces of the demon strators are pressed against it
the judge shakes a tired fist at them
then he turns to sherman
you go home now
and be decent
you hear me
i hear you your honor
the judge shakes his fist at sherman too
then he opens the fist and offers his hand to sherman
sherman takes it
s bonfire of the vanities rev
through the iron gates
it was the last i saw of sherman mccoy
sherman turns and walks away down the corridors of justice
the judge watches him go
sherman disappears into a great whiteness as we hear and so we come to the end of our story
sherman you see who started with so much lost everything
but he gained his soul
whereas i you see who started with so little gained everything
thru thru coming out of the wall of flashbulbs we saw at the beginning
a vast crowd of black ties and evening gowns surge toward him cheering applauding
a voice rings out on a microphone
the winner of the pulitzer prize the national book award and just about every other prize you can win ladies and gentlemen mr
j bonfire of the vanities rev
as he rises unsteadily to his feet the room goes wild with applause
peter waves and makes his way toward the podium
but what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses ah well
there are compensations
peter reaches the podium and faces a standing ovation
cameras begin to flash
end credits begin
beginning with peter at the podium and continuing to include shots of everyone congratulating peter albert fox reverend bacon abe weiss gerald moore fillippo chiarazzi kramer etc
finally the flashing cameras fade and we
lying in his bed
and then his nose twitches
his hand comes up and scratches his nose
his eyes open
he sits up looks around figures where he is
he gets out of bed disconnects the i
comes out of hospital he smiles and walks away down the street
